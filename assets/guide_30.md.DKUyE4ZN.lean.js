Roughly speaking, every vector of C should appear as a weighted average of extreme points, a concept made more precise by generalizing the notion of weighted average from a convex combination to an integral taken over the set E of extreme points. Here C is a subset of a real vector space V, and the main thrust of the theory is to treat the cases where V is an infinite-dimensional (locally convex Hausdorff) topological vector space along lines similar to the finite-dimensional case. The main concerns of Gustave Choquet were in potential theory. Choquet theory has become a general paradigm, particularly for treating convex cones as determined by their extreme rays, and so for many different notions of positivity in mathematics. The two ends of a line segment determine the points in between: in vector terms the segment from v to w consists of the Œªv + (1 ‚àí Œª)w with 0 ‚â§ Œª ‚â§ 1. The classical result of Hermann Minkowski says that in Euclidean space, a bounded, closed convex set C is the convex hull of its extreme point set E, so that any c in C is a (finite) convex combination of points e of E. Here E may be a finite or an infinite set. In vector terms, by assigning non-negative weights w(e) to the e in E, almost all 0, we can represent any c in C as : c = \\\\sum_{e\\\\in E} w(e) e\\\\ with : \\\\sum_{e\\\\in E} w(e) = 1.\\\\ In any case the w(e) give a probability measure supported on a finite subset of E. For any affine function f on C, its value at the point c is :f (c) = \\\\int f(e) d w(e). In the infinite dimensional setting, one would like to make a similar statement. Choquet's theorem states that for a compact convex subset C of a normed space V, given c in C there exists a probability measure w supported on the set E of extreme points of C such that, for any affine function f on C, :f (c) = \\\\int f(e) d w(e). In practice V will be a Banach space. The original Krein‚ÄìMilman theorem follows from Choquet's result. Another corollary is the Riesz representation theorem for states on the continuous functions on a metrizable compact Hausdorff space. More generally, for V a locally convex topological vector space, the Choquet‚ÄìBishop‚Äìde Leeuw theoremErrett Bishop; Karl de Leeuw. \\"The representations of linear functionals by measures on sets of extreme points\\". Annales de l'Institut Fourier, 9 (1959), pp. 305‚Äì331. gives the same formal statement. In addition to the existence of a probability measure supported on the extreme boundary that represents a given point c, one might also consider the uniqueness of such measures. It is easy to see that uniqueness does not hold even in the finite dimensional setting. One can take, for counterexamples, the convex set to be a cube or a ball in R3. Uniqueness does hold, however, when the convex set is a finite dimensional simplex. A finite dimensional simplex is a special case of a Choquet simplex. Any point in a Choquet simplex is represented by a unique probability measure on the extreme points.

Club career =Norwich City= Jarvis began his career as a trainee with Norwich City, making history as the youngest player to appear in their reserve side when aged only 14. The younger brother of fellow Norwich academy product Ryan Jarvis, he progressed to become a trainee with the Canaries and made his senior debut as a second-half substitute for Dean Marney in a 2‚Äì1 League Cup defeat away to Birmingham City on 26 October 2005. His league debut came on 5 November 2005, as a substitute in a 2‚Äì0 defeat away to Wolverhampton Wanderers. He made one further appearance in the league as a substitute, away to Millwall, before signing a professional contract in January 2006. The two Jarvis brothers played together for Norwich on only one occasion ‚Äì a League Cup tie against Rotherham United on 19 September 2006. That proved to be Jarvis' only appearance for Norwich in the 2006‚Äì07 season, as he was loaned out to League Two side Torquay on 25 January 2007. He played four times for the Gulls before a back injury ended his loan spell. After recovering, Jarvis played out the remainder of the season on loan at League One Rotherham United, making ten appearances. It would be almost a year on from the League Cup game at Rotherham until Jarvis next played a competitive game for Norwich. With suspensions to Dion Dublin, Jason Shackell, and Julien Brellier, Jarvis started in a League Cup Third Round tie on 25 September 2007 away to then Premier League high-flyers Manchester City, along with fellow academy graduate Michael Spillane. Both players performances drew high praise from the media, as Norwich lost the game 1‚Äì0. Jarvis started his first ever league game for Norwich against Sheffield Wednesday four days later, and went on to start in three further games. However, he failed to feature under new Canaries manager Glenn Roeder, who was appointed on 30 October 2007, and was released by the club in May 2008. =Luton Town= Jarvis signed for League Two side Luton Town, who had been hit with a 30-point deduction, on 7 August 2008. He found some familiar faces in the dressing room, as the Hatters' squad included ex-Norwich teammates Michael Spillane, Chris Martin and Paul McVeigh. Jarvis played a total of 46 games for Luton in 2008‚Äì09, including in every round of the club's Football League Trophy success, scoring the winning goal in the quarter-final against Walsall. He is known for his accurate set piece delivery, using this to contribute to ten assists in the 2008‚Äì09 season. Though he was a regular player under Luton manager Mick Harford, his dismissal in October 2009, and subsequent replacement in Richard Money, saw Jarvis used sparsely. On 7 May 2010, he was released from his contract at Luton, having made 71 appearances for the club. =Barnet= In June 2010, Jarvis joined Barnet. He made his debut for the Bees on the opening day of the 2010‚Äì11 season away to Chesterfield and was replaced in the 54th minute by fellow debutant, Ricky Holmes. He left Barnet at the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season, having made 22 league appearances. =Cambridge United= Jarvis signed a one-month contract with Conference National side Cambridge United in August 2011 after impressing during a trial. This was then extended to a one-year contract on 31 August 2011. The midfielder signed a new one-year contract with The U's on 8 May 2012 after making 39 starts in his first season at the club. =Lowestoft Town= After a brief spell in Australia with Oakleigh Cannons, Jarvis joined Lowestoft Town in 2013. After 159 league appearances, he joined Dereham Town in April 2018 before re-joining the Trawler Boys for the 2018‚Äì19 season.Busy time ahead as Dereham bid to get back in play-off huntRossi Jarvis and Kieran Higgs sign for Lowestoft Town International career Whilst in non-League football with Luton, Jarvis was eligible to be called into the England C squad for friendlies against both Hungary under-23's and Poland under-23's in September and November 2009. He played in both, including captaining the side to a 2‚Äì1 victory in Poland.

He is best known for being the lyricist of the Filipino song Bayan Ko.  Early life  De Jes√∫s was born on November 22, 1896 in Santa Cruz, Manila to Vicente de Jes√∫s, the first health bureau director of the American occupation government, and Susana Pangilinan of Pampanga. He was christened Jos√© Cecilio de Jes√∫s but he later dropped Cecilio and replaced it with the Spanish name Coraz√≥n (heart) because he said it best described his character. De Jes√∫s spent his childhood in Santa Maria, his father's hometown. He completed his education at the Liceo de Manila, where he graduated in 1916.  King of the Balagtasan  On March 28, 1924, de Jes√∫s and other leading Tagalog writers met at a women's school in Tondo, Manila, under the auspices of Filipino educator Rosa Sevilla, to discuss how to celebrate the birth anniversary of Tagalog poet Francisco Balagtas on April 2. They decided to hold a traditional duplo, or a dramatic debate in verse that was in its waning days in the 1920s. They changed the format of the duplo and renamed it balagtasan in honor of Balagtas. There were three pairs of poets who participated in the first balagtasan on April 6, 1924 at the defunct Instituto de Mujeres (Women's Institute), founded by Sevilla, but the audience were most impressed by de Jes√∫s and another Filipino poet, Florentino Collantes. The balagtasan was an instant hit, later becoming became a common feature in Manila's biggest and most expensive theaters until the 1950s. De Jes√∫s and Collantes were pitted against each other in a contrived rivalry and a showdown was set for October 18, 1925 at the Olympic Stadium. De Jes√∫s was acclaimed winner of the showdown and was dubbed \\"Hari ng Balagtasan\\" (king of versified debate). He held the title until his death in 1932.  Contribution to the spread of Balagtasan  De Jes√∫s, who was already famous around the Philippines as Huseng Batute, was asked in 1930 to act in the movie Oriental Blood, which starred Atang dela Rama and Carmen Rosales, the most famous actresses of the day, and his own son, Jos√© Coraz√≥n de Jes√∫s, Jr., who would later gain some fame as a silent movie actor.  Death  De Jes√∫s contracted an ulcer during the filming of Oriental Blood and died of ulcer complications on May 26, 1932. He was survived by his wife Asunci√≥n Lacdan de Jes√∫s and children Teresa, Jos√© Jr., and Rogelio. Upon his death, his heart was donated to a government museum where it was preserved until it was buried with his mother. He was finally interred at the Manila North Cemetery where he was buried under a tree, as he wished in his poems Isang Punong Kahoy (One Tree) and Ang Akasya (The Acacia). Many of his descendants now live in Canada, the United States as well as the Philippines, carrying on the family name of Aguila, as only his daughter Teresa, married and had children.  Selected works  Jos√© Coraz√≥n de Jes√∫s's works appeared on several magazines and newspapers, notably Ang Democracia, Taliba, Liwayway, ang buhay sa nddu and Sampagita. In addition, his works have appeared in various anthologies and textbooks from grade school to college. Among his more popular works are: *Ang Manok Kong Bulik (\\"My White Rooster\\", 1911) - a poem about a country man's misfortune in cockfighting *Barong Tagalog (1921) - poem written after the Filipino national costume *Ang Pagbabalik (\\"Homecoming\\", 1924) *Ang Pamana (\\"The Legacy\\", 1925) *Isang Punongkahoy (\\"A Tree\\", 1932) Some of his poems were set into music; among these are: *Bayan Ko (\\"My Country\\", 1929) - music by Constancio de Guzman *Pakiusap (\\"A Request\\") - music by Francisco Santiago See also * Literature of the Philippines * History of the Philippines * Jos√© Coraz√≥n de Jes√∫s, Jr. References * Almario, Virgilio S.

He was New Jersey Attorney General for twenty years (1877 to 1897), and served as United States Minister to the Papal States from 1858 to 1861. The scion of a family long prominent in New Jersey government and politics, John P. Stockton was a native of Princeton, New Jersey and an 1843 graduate of Princeton University. After studying law, attaining admission to the bar, and practicing in Princeton and Trenton, in 1858 Stockton was appointed as Minister to the Papal States. He served until 1861, and returned home after the Republican administration of Abraham Lincoln came to power following the 1860 presidential election. In March 1865, Stockton was elected to the U.S. Senate. In March, 1866 the Senate voted to remove him after his election was contested on the grounds that he had been chosen by a plurality of the New Jersey legislature, rather than a majority. He returned to the Senate in 1869 and served one six-year term, March 1869 to March 1875. After losing renomination to the Senate in 1875, in 1877 he was appointed as state attorney general, a position he continued to hold until he retired in 1897. Stockton died in New York City on January 22, 1900. He was buried at Princeton Cemetery. Early life Born in Princeton, New Jersey, Stockton was the son of Navy officer and Senator Robert F. Stockton and Harriet M. (Potter) Stockton. He was the grandson of Richard Stockton (1764-1828) and great-grandson of Richard Stockton (1730-1781), both prominent New Jersey politicians. John Stockton was educated privately and graduated from Princeton University, then known as the College of New Jersey, in 1843. Start of career Stockton studied law with his cousin Richard Stockton Field, was admitted to the bar in 1846, and practiced in Princeton and Trenton. From 1852 to 1858, Stockton served as reporter of decisions for the state court of chancery. Minister to Rome In 1858, he was appointed US minister to the Papal States, and he served until 1861. During his time in Rome, Stockton became involved in resolving the controversy created when the Pontifical Swiss Guard attacked and robbed several American citizens. Edward Newton Perkins and his party were staying at a hotel Perugia when members of the Pope's army stormed the city on June 20, 1859. The soldiers killed the owner of the hotel and two of his staff, then robbed the terrified guests. Perkins and his family were among the victims, and Perkins' complained to Stockton, who sent Perkins' complaint and one of his own to Secretary of State Lewis Cass, and had them published in The New York Times. The Papal States' loss of prestige and moral authority as a result of this incident contributed to the change in political climate that made possible the annexation of the Papal States to the newly unified Italian city- states when they were organized as the Kingdom of Italy in 1860. Republican Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 presidential election and began to make new appointments to diplomatic posts after taking office in 1861. Stockton resigned, and returned to New Jersey to resume the practice of law. U.S. Senator Stockton was elected to the US Senate in 1865, and served from March 15, 1865 to March 27, 1866. On March 27 the Senate voted 23 to 20 that Stockton's election had been improper on the grounds that he was chosen by a plurality rather than a majority of the state legislature. Most of the senators who voted for Stockton's removal wanted to ensure the closely divided Senate would be able to override Democratic President Andrew Johnson's Reconstruction era vetoes by replacing Stockton with a Republican. Congress later passed a law requiring state legislative majorities in elections for U.S. Senators, resolving the question of whether a plurality was sufficient. In 1869, Stockton was again elected to the Senate, and he served one term, March 4, 1869 to March 3, 1875. While in Washington, D.C. attending a Senate session in 1869, Stockton's Trenton home was burglarized. According to news accounts of the break-in, the burglars found nothing of value to steal, and contented themselves with upending the home's furniture and dressing the Stockton family's brooms in their old clothes. In 1872, he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention. In January 1875, Stockton was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination, and he left the Senate at the end of his term. Later career Stockton served as New Jersey Attorney General from April 8, 1877 to April 5, 1897. During his tenure, Stockton was appointed to a three-member commission that proposed revisions and updates to New Jersey's state court processes and procedures. The commission's final report was accepted by the state legislature and codified into law. In addition to practicing law and serving as attorney general, Stockton remained active in Democratic Party politics. He was a delegate to several state and national party conventions, including the 1884 Democratic National Convention. Death and burial Stockton died on January 22, 1900 at the Hotel Hanover in New York City, where he had lived for several months with his daughter Julia and her husband. He was interred at Princeton Cemetery in Princeton. Family In 1845, Stockton married Sarah Marks (1829-1887). She was from a Jewish family in New Orleans, and the marriage scandalized polite society in New Jersey. Sarah Marks Stockton later observed that she was never accepted in Princeton's social circles, even after she began worshipping as an Episcopalian. The Stocktons were the parents of: Robert Field (1847-1891); John Potter (1852-1927); Sarah (Saidee) (1853-1868); Richard (1858-1929); and Julia Stockton St. John (1861-1905).

Before the company was formed to produce finished submarine cable Hooper had furnished core for other companies, particularly that of William Thomas Henley, to armor and sheathe. The original core works were located at Mitcham, London with the later complete cable, core with external sheathing, production located and later consolidated at Millwall and the company renamed Hooper's Telegraph Works.The inner portion of submarine cable containing the conductors around which additional protections would be applied. At first Hooper's only made the core. The company was placed into liquidation in 1877 and operated as a private company until, after Hooper's death in 1888 the company was again operating as a privately subscribed, limited company. By 1894 the company was trading as Hooper's Telegraph and India Rubber Works Ltd. Cable The company's major operations concerned submarine cables but it and William Hooper's earlier cable core manufacturing business also made cable for surface use, including military use for field telegraph communications. The Hooper core was also used for indoor circuits. The company's first large submarine cable order was from Great Northern Telegraph Company for a nautical mile cable linking Vladivostok with Hong Kong, via Shanghai. Hooper's rubber goods factory had previously been contracted by the Indian government to produce of insulated cable and another contract producing cable to link India and Ceylon. The cable ship (CS) Great Northern,Built by Denton Gray and Company, West Hartlepool, 1870, purchased by Hooper's in 1871, with four cable tanks, two bow sheaves and cable laying machinery for laying the 1871 Vladivostock - Nagasaki - Shanghai - Hong Kong cable. CS Hooper pictured here as CS Silvertownin 1901 after sale and renaming in 1881. The company had considered a trans Atlantic cable from England the United States via Bermuda and ordered a ship capable of carrying the entire cable proposed for the England-Bermuda segment. The ship was to be named Great Western but the cable plan was abandoned, with cable and ship completed, in favor of a cable on the east coast of South America with a new company, the Western and Brazilian Telegraph Company, and the ship renamed .Built by C. Mitchell and Co., Newcastle, 1873, . Sold 1881 to India Rubber, Gutta Percha and Telegraph Works Company and renamed Silvertown which was active in cable work through 1913. Silvertown began the trans Pacific cable at San Francisco for the Commercial Pacific Cable Company in 1902. The ship, second to be designed as a cable ship, was second in size at the time only to SS Great Eastern. Hooper was launched 29 March 1873 after four and a half months construction, noted as the first ship designed specifically to lay Atlantic cable, with three cable tanks in depth and , and in diameter with storage capacity. The ship laid cable linking Par√°-Maranham-Ceara-Pernambuco-Bahia-Rio de Janeiro in 1873. In connection with a cable linking Europe to Brazil Hooper's became involved in a lawsuit, Menier v. Hooper's Telegraph Works (Limited), that set precedent concerning the rights of minority shareholders. The European Telegraph Company, in which Hooper's owned a majority of shares, was formed to lay a cable linking Portugal and Brazil under a concession granted by Brazil and other governments. Hooper's held 3,000 shares, Emile Justin Menier held 2,000 and Baron de Mau√°, a director of the company, held 25 shares. Others held 300 shares. Hooper's was to supply the cable but found it would be more profitable to supply cable to a rival company and concession formed around Baron de Mau√°. Hoopers used its majority position to annul the European Telegraph Company's concession in favor of the new company and, when the European Telegraph Company sued, used its majority position to have the suit abandoned and the company dissolved. Menier filed against Baron de Mau√° and Hooper's Telegraph Works for its profits from those dealings. His suit was successful and the actions of Hooper's Telegraph Workswere found to amount to blatant and fraudulent appropriation of property. Cables were laid in the Caribbean area and then the company attempted to gain investors for a South African cable but failed.

The letter sets forth that Innocent, desiring to have peace restored to those parts which were then distracted by dissensions, sent for that purpose three legates to Frederick as the chief author of those evils, pointed out the way to peace, and promised that he would do his own part to restore it. Frederick agreed to terms of peace, which he swore to observe, but which he at once violated. The letter then sets forth the crimes of which Frederick was guilty. It accuses him of perjury; of contempt for the spiritual authority of the Roman Pontiff, by disregarding the excommunication pronounced against him and by compelling others to do so; of invading pontifical territory; of having broken the terms of peace made with Pope Gregory, and which he swore to keep; of oppressing the Church in Sicily; of having taken, persecuted, and done to death bishops and others who were on their way to Rome for a council which he himself had asked to be convoked; of having incurred suspicion of heresy for treating a papal excommunication with contempt; of having conspired with the Saracens and other enemies of Christianity; of being guilty of the death of Louis I, Duke of Bavaria, and of giving his daughter in marriage to a schismatic; of not paying tribute for Sicily, which is the patrimony of St. Peter. For these and for other crimes, Innocent IV, by this apostolic letter, declares Frederick unworthy to rule, and his subjects freed from their duty of obedience to him as sovereign.

History of Australians abroad A survey in 2002 of Australians who were emigrating found that most were leaving for employment reasons. For the period 1999‚Äì2003, it was estimated that there were 346,000 Australian-born people living in other OECD countries: of these 96,900 lived in the United Kingdom, 65,200 lived in the United States and 42,000 lived in New Zealand. =Origin of the term= The term Australian diaspora was used in reference to Australian citizens living abroad in a 2003 Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) research report, \\"Australia's Diaspora: Its Size, Nature and Policy Implications\\". This report both identified the phenomenon and argued for an Australian government policy of maintaining active contact with the diaspora. The term has been picked up by others.For example: In 2005, Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee (a standing committee) reported into the issue of Expatriate Australians and made recommendations that the \\"Australian Government needs to make greater efforts to connect with and engage our expatriate community\\". =\\"Brain drain\\"= The diaspora has been the focus of policy concerns over a so-called \\"brain drain\\" from Australia. However, the 2003 CEDA report argued the phenomenon was essentially positive: rather than experiencing a \\"brain drain\\", Australia was in fact seeing both \\"brain circulation\\" as Australians added to their skills and expertise, and a \\"brain gain\\", as these skilled expatriates tended to return to Australia and new skilled immigrants were arriving. Between 1999 and 2003, there were seven highly educated migrants to Australia for every one highly educated Australian who was living elsewhere in countries within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Levels of skilled immigration to Australia reflect Government policies to \\"practise a selective immigration policy based on human capital criteria\\". United Kingdom During 1999‚Äì2003, 96,900 (or one third of all Australian expatriates), lived in the United Kingdom. The 2011 UK Census recorded 113,592 residents born in Australia in England, 2,695 in Wales, 8,279 in Scotland, and 1,750 in Northern Ireland. The Office for National Statistics estimates that 113,000 people born in Australia were resident in the UK in 2013. Figure given is the central estimate.

In southern China there are 10,000 Australians.http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-08/13/content_6930079.htm United States In December 2001, the Department of Foreign Affairs estimated that there were 106,000 Australian citizens resident in the United States of America. The major places of residence were: 25,000 living in Los Angeles; 17,000 in San Francisco; 17,000 in Washington DC; and 15,000 in New York. For the period 1999‚Äì2003, it was estimated that 22% of Australian expatriates, 65,200, were living in the United States. According to a 2010 estimate, 40,000 Australians were in Los Angeles. Australian migration to the United States is greater than Americans going to Australia. At the 2006 census, 71,718 Australian residents declared that they were American- born,Australian Bureau of Statistics ‚Äì Ethnic Media Kit a smaller population than the population estimate of Australians living in the United States. Comparison with the expatriate populations of other countries The ratio of expatriate Australians in 2005 was 2.8 Australian-born people aged 15 years or over per 100 Australian born people aged 15 years and over within Australia. This ratio is much lower than many other countries in the OECD ‚Äì the highest ratios in 2005 were for Ireland (29 Irish-born people aged 15 years and over in other OECD countries for every 100 in Ireland) and for New Zealand (19 per 100). The Australian ratio was higher than that of the United States (less than one person in other OECD countries per 100 USA-born within the USA). Education levels of Australian expatriates were high: 44% of Australian expatriates in other OECD countries had a high level of education.Notes on education levels from the ABS: (c) High level includes ISCED5A: Academic tertiary, ISCED5B: Vocational tertiary, ISCED 6: Advanced research. (d) Overall, 3% of OECD expatriates in the OECD had no information on educational attainment. These have been excluded from the total in calculating the proportion. (e) The migrant to expatriate ratio for people with a high level of education for a particular country is: the ratio of the number of migrants from other OECD countries with a high level of education living in that country, to the number of that country's expatriates with a high level of education. Japanese expatriates had the highest proportion, with 50% having a high level of education. 49% of expatriates from the USA had a high education as did 45% of expatriates from New Zealand.

This made a new ocean passage and divided Stradbroke Island in two (North & South). The continuous longshore drift continued to eroded South Stradbroke Island. Navigational difficulties lead to boating accidents, prompting the planning and design of the Gold Coast Seaway.Salter, L 2002, South Stradbroke Island Lindy Salter, The Gap The design of the Gold Coast Seaway relied on data from the Beach Protection Authority to prevent it becoming a baymouth bar connecting to South Stradbroke Island. Construction of the project had six main phases: Retaining walls using approximately one million tonnes of imported rock, Dredging 4.5 million cubic metres sand, closure of the old entrance, sand bypassing system, revegetation and sewage outfall. Community growth There was a township called Moondarewa located on the southern tip of South Stradbroke Island. This township was lost into the sea in the late 1930s during storms as the Broadwater Entrance migrated northwards. The township of Moondarewa was located in the area near where Seaworld is located today (). During the 1940s the Southport Yacht Club grew and added marina facilities for the increasing number of private boats wanting to moor on the Spits' eastern side of the Broadwater. Since the 1950s and '60s, the local prawning industry used The Spit for their berth. The Spit continued to develop, with tourist attractions opening in the 1960s. It is now home to Sea World theme park, an upmarket shopping restaurant and bar precinct and several resorts. Seaworld Drive is the main street connecting the area of The Spit to the neighbourhood of Main Beach. Parklands and naturally vegetated sand dunes on the eastern Ocean side of the Spit start in Main Beach at Kemp St and Main Beach Parade and run continuously to the tip of the Spit. Some popular parks are within this nature strip. In the southern end toward Main Beach neighbourhood is Hollingdale Park with picnic facilities. Further north past Seaworld Resort, is Phillip Park popular for wedding photographs. At the northern end is Doug Jennings Park. A large area with parking and Public facilities. It covers the whole north end of The Spit, with views to Wave Break Island to the east and South Stradbroke Island to the north. It is a popular family park and with rod fishing a familiar sight. The park has been a popular outdoor concert and event venue. It is now part of annual music events like Summadayze.

This is called a solid state circuit because all of the electrical action in the circuit occurs within solid materials. Solid-state electronics means semiconductor electronics: electronic equipment using semiconductor devices such as transistors, diodes and integrated circuits (ICs). The term is also used for devices in which semiconductor electronics which have no moving parts replace devices with moving parts, such as the solid-state relay in which transistor switches are used in place of a moving-arm electromechanical relay, or the solid-state drive (SSD) a type of semiconductor memory used in computers to replace hard disk drives, which store data on a rotating disk. The term \\"solid state\\" became popular in the beginning of the semiconductor era in the 1960s to distinguish this new technology based on the transistor, in which the electronic action of devices occurred in a solid state, from previous electronic equipment that used vacuum tubes, in which the electronic action occurred in a gaseous state. A semiconductor device works by controlling an electric current consisting of electrons or holes moving within a solid crystalline piece of semiconducting material such as silicon, while the thermionic vacuum tubes it replaced worked by controlling current conducted by a gas of particles, electrons or ions, moving in a vacuum within a sealed tube. History Although the first solid state electronic device was the cat's whisker detector, a crude semiconductor diode invented around 1904, solid state electronics really started with the invention of the first working transistor in 1947.Papadopoulos (2013) Solid-State Electronic Devices: An Introduction , p. 11, 81-83 The first working transistor was a point-contact transistor invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain while working under William Shockley at Bell Laboratories in 1947. Before that, all electronic equipment used vacuum tubes, because vacuum tubes were the only electronic components that could amplify‚Äîan essential capability in all electronics. The MOSFET (metal-oxide-silicon field-effect transistor), also known as the MOS transistor, was invented by Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959. The MOS transistor's advantages include high scalability, affordability, low power consumption, and high density. The MOS transistor revolutionized the electronics industry, and is the most common semiconductor device in the world. The replacement of bulky, fragile, energy- hungry vacuum tubes by transistors in the 1960s and 1970s created a revolution not just in technology but in people's habits, making possible the first truly portable consumer electronics such as the transistor radio, cassette tape player, walkie-talkie and quartz watch, as well as the first practical computers and mobile phones. Examples of solid state electronic devices are the microprocessor chip, LED lamp, solar cell, charge coupled device (CCD) image sensor used in cameras, and semiconductor laser.

As well as running a number of local services, it also ran a regular service to London (via the M40 motorway) under the Oxford Tube brand. It was sold in July 1997 to Stagecoach, becoming Stagecoach in Oxfordshire.  Foundation  Thames Transit was founded in March 1987 by Harry Blundred, a former bus driver and controller, who led a management buyout of Devon General during the privatisation of the National Bus Company in August 1986.Blundred leads Devon buy out Commercial Motor 30 August 1986 page 20Thames Transit Tigers tear into Oxford Motor Services Commercial Motor 7 March 1987 page 22 Blundred started Thames Transit from scratch in Oxfordshire with buses cascaded from his Devon General operation on two routes: *bus route 1 between the Blackbird Leys housing estate and Oxford city centre *coach route 100, branded the Oxford Tube, running scheduled express services between Oxford and London The firm struggled under intense competition from the incumbent City of Oxford Motor Services, but ultimately succeeded in increasing patronage through a series of innovative approaches. Among these, the use of branding was particularly successful in the case of the Oxford Tube and Blackbird Flyer. Later branding efforts were not always so successful, and Oxford Tube is the only brand name to survive today. Competition remained fierce and in the mid-1990s a price war erupted, with for example a 12-journey ticket between Oxford and London costing just ¬£15. The price war was abandoned before these unsustainable fares could drive either company out of business. Ford Transit Mellor with Marston Pony branding The firm is noted for introducing minibuses to Oxford. The original vehicles on local routes were sixteen seater Ford Transits, colloquially called Snoopys for their resemblance at the front to the cartoon character. The buses featured a single front entrance and exit door and room for four standing passengers. They eased initial recruitment concerns because drivers did not have to hold a full PSV licence to drive them. The primary reason behind their use, however, was that Blundred felt greater profitability could be gained through running small buses at a high frequency, rather than running larger buses half-empty at a low frequency.  Expansion  In 1989 Thames Transit expanded by buying South Midland, the former country area of The City of Oxford Motor Services, primarily operating rural routes in Oxfordshire. This acquisition strengthened Thames Transit's hand against City of Oxford Motor Services, providing it with several routes where it was the sole provider. The company then grew significantly in the early 1990s, introducing larger Mercedes-Benz minibuses with 32-seat capacity and buying new vehicles for the Oxford Tube coach service, which was starting to perform well against rival City of Oxford's Citylink service. City of Oxford itself had been forced to spread its defensive tactics following the South Midland acquisition, and this allowed Thames Transit to grow. Dennis Dart with Blackbird Flyer branding In 1994 the firm bought its first midibuses: a fleet of 9.8 metre step-entrance Dennis Darts. Thirteen were bought for the original number 1 route, and new branding was applied, adorning the buses with a giant blackbird called 'Bertie' and the service named 'The Blackbird Flyer'. Continuing the minibus philosophy, the buses were scheduled every four or five minutes. There was a noticeable shift of traffic away from City of Oxford as passengers responded to Thames Transit's new branding and vehicles. The new vehicle type and the use of branding proved to be a precursor for other route changes; the company later incrementally introduced the Rose Hill Runner (number 3 route running from Rose Hill to Oxford city centre), City Cavalier (number 7 route: Barton to Cutteslowe via Headington, city centre and Summertown), Kidlington Cavalier (number 7A running originally from Kidlington to St Aldates), Carousel (10/10A \\"city circle\\" service running in both directions from the city centre to Summertown, Marston, Headington, Wood Farm, Cowley and back to the city centre), and Witney Weaver (100, Oxford to Witney and Carterton), as brands for existing routes which were upgraded to new Dennis Darts. It also introduced branding on the X9 Park and Ride service running between Oxford's largest P&R;, Redbridge, and the northern Pear Tree Park & Ride. The branding in this case was 'Gloria Glide', with buses featuring a picture of a six-foot female chauffeur and the slogan 'Park & Ride with Gloria Glide' ‚Äì which generated accusations of sexism by the University of Oxford.  Acquisition  In 1994 the Go-Ahead Group bought City of Oxford Motor Services, significantly strengthening its competitiveness. Following an effective rebranding and new vehicles to replace the older vehicles which were looking somewhat jaded against Thames Transit's improved services, City of Oxford launched 'New Fare Deals' in March 1995, symbolically referring to Thames Transit's entry into the city. New Fare Deals reduced fares on the routes where the two providers competed, while City of Oxford withdrew from less profitable routes to increase frequencies on the most lucrative and competitive corridors. Combined with new and spacious vehicles on some routes and staff poaching tactics, this significantly weakened Thames Transit's competitive strength. At this time Thames Transit introduced two new branded routes, The Wood Farm Woodman and The Marston Pony, in direct competition with long-established City of Oxford routes. Both routes were unsuccessful ‚Äì partly because they used tired vehicles but also because they failed to run frequently enough given the attenuation of staffing under the pressure of the bus war with City of Oxford. The bus war ended in autumn 1996, with both firms withdrawing from routes and increasing fares. Thames Transit withdrew its Park & Ride service and the Wood Farm Woodman and Marston Pony routes. It switched coaches scheduled between Oxford and Heathrow Airport under a short-lived express Heathrow Tube service, back to a longer cross country Heathrow route numbered the 390, which failed to compete with City of Oxford's long- established express Citylink X70 service to Heathrow (later rebranded The Airline). In July 1997 Harry Blundred sold Thames Transit to Stagecoach. The company was rebranded under the Stagecoach name, using Stagecoach Oxford and then Stagecoach in Oxfordshire on local routes but retaining the Oxford Tube brand name on the London express service. In 1995 Blundred founded the Transit Australia Group, which operated the Sunbus business in the state of Queensland operating services in Cairns, Ipswich, Rockhampton, Sunshine Coast and Townsville. Blundred retained the business until April 2008. As part of the deal Sunbus was also responsible for the operation of school bus services. These were sold in 1997 to Stagecoach.Buslink Australian Bus Fleet Lists  References   External links  *Showbus gallery Category:1987 establishments in England Category:1997 disestablishments in England Category:Former London bus operators Category:Former bus operators in Oxfordshire ","title":"Thames Transit"},{"id":"3656008","text":"Theodorus Anton \\"Dick\\" Nieuwenhuizen (born 6 April 1957) is a retired Dutch water polo player.

V. Prasad, was an Indian film producer, actor, director, cinematographer and businessman. He was one of the pioneers of Indian cinema and is the recipient of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, the highest Award for films in India. In 1980, he was awarded the Raghupathi Venkaiah Award, for his contribution to Telugu cinema. He founded Prasads Group in 1956, which include the Prasad Art Pictures, Prasad Studios, Prasads IMAX and L V Prasad Eye Institute. L. V. Prasad was the chairman of the 27th National Film Awards Selection Committee held at New Delhi in 1980. He was the chairman of the All India Selection Panel of Indian Panorama section for the 8th International Film Festival of India from 3 to 17 January 1981. Prasad was also the chairman of the International Jury for Children's Film Festival held in November 1981 at Madras. He was elected as the President of The South Indian Film Chamber of Commerce for the year 1982‚Äì83. He was a Member of the Board of Film Censors from October 1980 to February 1987. L. V. Prasad was Chairman of the Studio Owners, Council, a wing of Film Federation of India. The Government of India released a Commemorative postage stamp in his memory in 2006. Prasad also had the unique distinction of acting in the first talkies of three different languages of Indian cinema; Alam Ara (Hindi), Bhakta Prahlada (Telugu) and Kalidas (a Telugu and Tamil bilingual movie). Early life Akkineni Lakshmi Vara Prasada Rao was born on 17 January 1908 as the second son to Akkineni Sriramulu and Akkineni Basavamma in the remote village of Somavarappadu, in Eluru Taluk in Andhra Pradesh, India. The family was into agriculture and Prasad was a pampered child, very intelligent, but never interested in studies.The Hindu : Friday Review Hyderabad : A leader and a visionary At the age of 17, in the year 1924, he married his maternal uncle's daughter, Soundarya Manoharamma. Soon they had a baby girl. Prasad's father had mounting debts and declared insolvency, at which point Prasad looked to a cinema career. Career L. V. Prasad worked as an errand boy for Venus Film Company. He then joined India Pictures as an errand boy, where Akthar Nawaz cast him in a bit-part in the silent film Star of the East. In 1931, he acted in India's first \\"talkie\\", Alam Ara, recruited through Venus Film Company. Other minor roles followed. These films were made by Imperial Films, through which he met H. M. Reddy. Reddy gave Prasad a small role in Kalidas, the first Telugu and Tamil Bilingual \\"talkie\\", and subsequently in Bhakta Prahlada, the first Telugu \\"talkie\\". It was around this time that Prasad made contact with his family and then returned home to visit them. He then returned to Bombay with his wife and daughter, where his sons, Anand and Ramesh, were born. Prasad by chance got a role as an assistant director in Kamar-Al‚ÄìZaman, directed by Ali Shah. This was also the time that his name was shortened from Akkineni Lakshmi Vara Prasad Rao to L. V. Prasad, this being a consequence of a clerk finding the name too long to use. The shortened name stuck with him thereafter. Tantra Subrahmanyam assigned him a job of a production supervisor and assistant director for the film Kashta Jeevi, which took him to Bombay again. The film was abandoned after shooting three reels. Prasad was in no mood to leave now and he got a job as assistant director in a few other films. During this time, using his connections with Prithviraj Kapoor, he joined Prithvi Theatres and satisfied his acting passion. It was during this time that he met Raj Kapoor, the hero of his first Hindi production Sharada. In 1943, he got the opportunity to take on the responsibility of assistant director for Gruha Pravesam. Due to circumstances, he became the director of the film and then he was also chosen as the lead actor of the film! Gruha Pravesam, released in 1946 was one of the finest films of the forties and went on to become a classic of the period. After this, K. S. Prakasa Rao offered Prasad an important role in Drohi. During this time, Ramabrahmam was facing difficulty in finishing his film Palnati Yudham due to ill health and he chose Prasad to do justice to this film. After this in 1949, Prasad directed Mana Desam and introduced N. T. Rama Rao, later to become a legend in Telugu cinema, in a minor role. In 1950 Vijaya Pictures released their first film Shavukaru, establishing L. V. Prasad as a director. Samsaram, released in the same year, brought together the two legends of the Telugu film industry as brothers ‚Äì N. T. Rama Rao and Akkineni Nageswara Rao in a social drama which created records wherever it was released. The film provided a model for later film makers, a model and theme relevant and popular amongst film makers even today. After this, success chased him. He directed some memorable films in the fifties all of them known for their drama and fine humour. Rani a Hindi film took him to Bombay again and after that Jupiter Films engaged L. V. Prasad to direct their Magnum Opus Manohara, starring the legendary Sivaji Ganesan in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi. But L. V. Prasad had more goals to achieve. In 1955, he assigned D. Yoganand to direct his first production Ilavelpu in Telugu under the banner Lakshmi Productions. L. V. Prasad established Prasad Productions, soon after this in 1956. His second son Ramesh returned from the United States after obtaining his B.E.M.S degree and established Prasad Film Labs in Chennai in 1974. Prasad Productions made many memorable box office hits including Milan, Khilona, Sasural and Ek Duuje Ke Liye. L. V. Prasad contributed generously towards the establishment of L. V.

It was declared as a sanctuary in May 1978, covering an area of about , principally for protection of the sloth bear, which is now categorized as \\"Vulnerable A2cd+4cd;C1 ver 3.1\\" on the IUCN Red List. Their numbers are declining in the wild and they are threatened with extinction. The name \\"sloth\\" is said to be the epithet travellers and hunters in India gave to the bear when they saw it hanging upside down from branches of trees and consequently they identified it with sloth, an animal that hangs upside down. While it is now known as sloth bear, initially it was called \\"bear sloth\\" since the game hunters identified this species with the sloth of South America as the physical characteristics and arboreal habits of both species matched. Towards the later part of the 18th century, its scientific name was Ursine bradypus, Ursiform sloth or Bradypus ursinus. But when in the early 19th century, a sloth bear, housed in a zoo in France, was examined, scientists identified it correctly as a bear species and thereafter the name was changed from \\"bear sloth\\" to \\"sloth bear\\". Jessore hill, which is the back drop to the sanctuary, is also prefixed to form the full name \\"Jessore Sloth Bear Sanctuary\\". Ministry of Environment and Forests of the Government of India, Forest Department of Gujarat, well known Institutes and Universities of the country, stakeholders and local communities in and around the project area have been engaged in Conservation and Sustainable Management of Dryland Biodiversity of North Gujarat under a GEF/UNDP supported project with the objective of conservation of globally significant biodiversity. The two projects identified under the programme, as demonstration project sites were the Jessore and Balaram-Ambaji Sanctuaries. The information gathered under this project in respect of the Jessore Sloth Bear Sanctuary has enhanced the information base and is expected to help in building local establishments to adopt novel ideas to resolve the threats faced by the sanctuary. Geography The sanctuary is located in the Jessore hills of Aravalli hills, to the south of the Thar desert. It was declared a sanctuary covering an area of in 1978. The sanctuary area lies between the desert ecosystem and the dry deciduous type of ecosystem, and the forested area helps in arresting desertification and advancement of Thar desert. The nearest airport is that of Ahmedabad, about away. The nearest railway station is at Palanpur, away, and iqbalgadh village is at distance. The Sanctuary also houses two temples (one of them is the Kedarnath Mahadev temple), which are frequented by a large number of pilgrims during October‚ÄìNovember, and a protected sacred grove. Flora and fauna Jessore Sanctuary = Flora = The vegetation in the sanctuary consists of arid to semiarid and dry deciduous thorny scrub. A UNDP sponsored study of the flora of the sanctuary has identified 406 species of plants (90 trees, 47 shrubs, 33 climbers, 194 herbs, 31 grasses, six pteridophytes, two bryophytes, one epiphyte, and two fungi). A further analysis indicates that the families of tree species are 13, shrubs 15, herbs 11 and climbers 13. Some of the species reportedly belong to the threatened category as per IUCN; these are: Pavonia arabica, Tecomella undulata, Capparis cartilaginea, Dendrocalamus strictus, Sterculia urens and silver date palm and Ceropegia odorata, an endangered species. Six endemic species to India recorded are Ogeissus sericea, Chlorophytum borivilianum, Sterculia urens, Tecomella undulata, silver date palm and Dendrocalamus strictus. Further, 89 plants are recorded to have medicinal properties. However, forest area is reportedly diminishing, and the corridor with hill area forests of Aravalli is also reducing, disrupting the migration of the bears. As a result, forest areas are reported only in patches. Prosopis juliflora called locally as gando baval has become the dominant vegetation affecting spread of local species, growth of goat and cattle population and forest fires; about 40 per cent of the green cover in the lower areas and 20 per cent in hilly regions are covered by this weed. = Fauna = Apart from sloth bear, other fauna reported in the sanctuary are leopard, sambar, blue bull, wild boar, porcupine, and a variety of birds. Other endangered species harboured by the sanctuary are jungle cat, Asian palm civet, caracal, wolf and hyena. The faunal study by UNDP covered the herpetofaunal group. 14 species of amphibians and reptiles have been recorded here; the list includes Indian python (Python molurus) an endangered species, Indian flap-shelled turtle (Lissemys punctata) of vulnerable category and muggar (Crocodylus palustris) and Varanus (Varanus bengalensis) of endangered category. Threats faced by these species have been noted as water shortage, traffic, and hunting by snake charmers. Reptiles found also include cobra, krait, several types of viper and monitor lizard.  Avifauna  Studies of avifauna in the sanctuary revealed 105 species, including migratory birds. The list includes: four near threatened category birds comprising grey jungle fowl (Gallus sonneratii), white-bellied minivet (Pericrocotus erythropygus), Indian black ibis (Pseudibis papillosa) and painted stork (Mycturia leucocephala); the vulnerable category (as per IUCN Red List) are white-winged black tit (Parus nuchalis), Asian openbill (Anastomus oscitans), Indian white- rumped vulture (Gyps Bengalensis), Indian vulture (Gyps indicus), red-headed vulture (Sarcogyps calvus) and red-necked falcon (Falco chicquera).  Mammals  20 species of mammalian fauna have been identified. Of these Indian pangolin (Manis crassicaudata) and sloth bear (Melursus ursinus) are near threatened and vulnerable respectively. Threats A captive sloth bear (Melursus ursinus) and handler in Pushkar The threats faced by the sanctuary, and the sloth bear in particular, are: the disappearing forests due to anthropogenic and cattle pressures; destruction of termite hills (source of favourite food for the bear) by humans, capturing for training to perform in circuses (they are popular as \\"dancing bears\\"), travelling shows and fairs. Poaching and trade in sloth bears or their parts has also been reported. Even the cubs are captured and removed from the sanctuary. The UNDP study has also listed threats to avifauna as deterioration of the habitat, overgrazing, quarrying (which causes noise pollution and dust), damage to ground vegetation by the invasive Prosopis juliflora, scarcity of water, hunting, and anthropogenic pressure resulting in habitat destruction. However, threat from the sloth bears is also reported to people and crops. The human-sloth bear conflict was scientifically examined for one year (between June 2007 and July 2008 in Jessore Sanctuary and also in the Mount Abu Sanctuary, which revealed that there were human casualties due to attack by bears. Thirty such attacks on humans (more on males) in the forest, villages and crop fields were reported during the study period, with summer season recording the maximum number followed by monsoon and winter. Crop damage of varying degree by bears was also reported. This has caused fear among the villagers. However, under these conditions of threat to life and crops, the bears may be killed under the law to protect life or property. Conservation Proposals to create a biological corridor of four protected areas in the Aravalli hills as conservation area namely, the Jessore and Balaram Ambaji in Gujarat in Banskantha and Sabarkantha, and Mt. Abu and Fulwar-Ki-Nar in the districts of Udaipur and Sirohi in Rajasthan to be developed as multiple use zones, have been mooted since all these are sanctuaries for sloth bear. Community participation is also suggested in this plan.

Chasles' theorem shows that each Euclidean displacement in three-dimensional space has a screw axis, and the displacement can be decomposed into a rotation about and a slide along this screw axis.Bottema, O, and B. Roth, Theoretical Kinematics, Dover Publications (September 1990), link to Google booksHunt, K. H., Kinematic Geometry of Mechanism, Oxford University Press, 1990 Pl√ºcker coordinates are used to locate a screw axis in space, and consist of a pair of three-dimensional vectors. The first vector identifies the direction of the axis, and the second locates its position. The special case when the first vector is zero is interpreted as a pure translation in the direction of the second vector. A screw axis is associated with each pair of vectors in the algebra of screws, also known as screw theory.R.S. Ball, A Treatise on the Theory of Screws, Hodges, Dublin, 1876, Appendix 1, University Press, Cambridge, 1900, p. 510 The spatial movement of a body can be represented by a continuous set of displacements. Because each of these displacements has a screw axis, the movement has an associated ruled surface known as a screw surface. This surface is not the same as the axode, which is traced by the instantaneous screw axes of the movement of a body. The instantaneous screw axis, or 'instantaneous helical axis' (IHA), is the axis of the helicoidal field generated by the velocities of every point in a moving body. When a spatial displacement specializes to a planar displacement, the screw axis becomes the displacement pole, and the instantaneous screw axis becomes the velocity pole, or instantaneous center of rotation, also called an instant center. The term centro is also used for a velocity pole, and the locus of these points for a planar movement is called a centrode.Homer D. Eckhardt, Kinematic Design of Machines and Mechanisms, McGraw-Hill (1998) p. 63 on-line at Google books History The proof that a spatial displacement can be decomposed into a rotation and slide around and along a line in space is attributed to Michel Chasles in 1830.M.

Mozzi, Discorso matematico sopra il rotamento momentaneo dei corpi, Stamperia di Donato Campo, Napoli, 1763M. Ceccarelli, Screw axis defined by Giulio Mozzi in 1763 and early studies on helicoidal motion, Mechanism and Machine Theory 35 (2000) 761-770 Screw axis symmetry The Boerdijk‚ÄìCoxeter helix is an example of a screw axis symmetry that is nonperiodic. A screw displacement (also screw operation or rotary translation) is the composition of a rotation by an angle œÜ about an axis (called the screw axis) with a translation by a distance d along this axis. A positive rotation direction usually means one that corresponds to the translation direction by the right-hand rule. Except for œÜ = 180¬∞, we have to distinguish a screw displacement from its mirror image. Unlike for rotations, a righthand and lefthand screw operation generate different groups. The combination of a rotation about an axis and a translation in a perpendicular direction is a rotation about a parallel axis. However, a screw operation with a nonzero translation vector along the axis cannot be reduced like that. Thus the effect of a rotation combined with any translation is a screw operation in the general sense, with as special cases a pure translation, a pure rotation and the identity. Together these are all the direct isometries in 3D. 31 screw axis in crystal structure of tellurium In crystallography, a screw axis symmetry is a combination of rotation about an axis and a translation parallel to that axis which leaves a crystal unchanged. If œÜ = 360¬∞/n for some positive integer n, then screw axis symmetry implies translational symmetry with a translation vector which is n times that of the screw disubscript. So, 63 is a rotation of 60¬∞ combined with a translation of 1/2 of the lattice vector, implying that there is also 3-fold rotational symmetry about this axis. The possibilities are 21, 31, 41, 42, 61, 62, and 63, and the enantiomorphous 32, 43, 64, and 65. A non-discrete screw axis isometry group contains all combinations of a rotation about some axis and a proportional translation along the axis (in rifling, the constant of proportionality is called the twist rate); in general this is combined with k-fold rotational isometries about the same axis (k ‚â• 1); the set of images of a point under the isometries is a k-fold helix; in addition there may be a 2-fold rotation about a perpendicularly intersecting axis, and hence a k-fold helix of such axes. Screw axis of a spatial displacement =Geometric argument= Let be an orientation-preserving rigid motion of R3. The set of these transformations is a subgroup of Euclidean motions known as the special Euclidean group SE(3). These rigid motions are defined by transformations of x in R3 given by : D(\\\\mathbf{x})=A(\\\\mathbf{x}) + \\\\mathbf{d} consisting of a three-dimensional rotation A followed by a translation by the vector d. A three-dimensional rotation A has a unique axis that defines a line L. Let the unit vector along this line be S so that the translation vector d can be resolved into a sum of two vectors, one parallel and one perpendicular to the axis L, that is, :\\\\mathbf{d}=\\\\mathbf{d}_L + \\\\mathbf{d}_{\\\\perp},\\\\quad \\\\mathbf{d}_L =(\\\\mathbf{d}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{S})\\\\mathbf{S}, \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{d}_{\\\\perp}=\\\\mathbf{d}- \\\\mathbf{d}_L. In this case, the rigid motion takes the form : D(\\\\mathbf{x})=(A(\\\\mathbf{x}) + \\\\mathbf{d}_{\\\\perp}) + \\\\mathbf{d}_L. Now, the orientation preserving rigid motion D* = A(x) + d‚ä• transforms all the points of R3 so that they remain in planes perpendicular to L. For a rigid motion of this type there is a unique point c in the plane P perpendicular to L through 0, such that : D^*(\\\\mathbf{C})=A(\\\\mathbf{C})+\\\\mathbf{d}_{\\\\perp}=\\\\mathbf{C}. The point C can be calculated as : \\\\mathbf{C}=[I-A]^{-1}\\\\mathbf{d}_{\\\\perp}, because d‚ä• does not have a component in the direction of the axis of A. A rigid motion D* with a fixed point must be a rotation of around the axis Lc through the point c. Therefore, the rigid motion : D(\\\\mathbf{x})=D^*(\\\\mathbf{x}) + \\\\mathbf{d}_L, consists of a rotation about the line Lc followed by a translation by the vector dL in the direction of the line Lc. Conclusion: every rigid motion of R3 is the result of a rotation of R3 about a line Lc followed by a translation in the direction of the line. The combination of a rotation about a line and translation along the line is called a screw motion. =Computing a point on the screw axis= A point C on the screw axis satisfies the equation:J. M. McCarthy and G. S. Soh, Geometric Design of Linkages, 2nd Edition, Springer 2010 : D^*(\\\\mathbf{C})=A(\\\\mathbf{C})+\\\\mathbf{d}_{\\\\perp}=\\\\mathbf{C}. Solve this equation for C using Cayley's formula for a rotation matrix : [A]=[I-B]^{-1}[I+B], where [B] is the skew-symmetric matrix constructed from Rodrigues' vector : \\\\mathbf{b}=\\\\tan\\\\frac{\\\\phi}{2}\\\\mathbf{S}, such that :[B]\\\\mathbf{y}=\\\\mathbf{b}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{y}. Use this form of the rotation A to obtain :\\\\mathbf{C} =[I-B]^{-1}[I+B]\\\\mathbf{C} + \\\\mathbf{d}_{\\\\perp},\\\\quad [I-B]\\\\mathbf{C} =[I+B]\\\\mathbf{C} + [I-B]\\\\mathbf{d}_{\\\\perp}, which becomes : -2[B]\\\\mathbf{C} =[I-B]\\\\mathbf{d}_{\\\\perp}. This equation can be solved for C on the screw axis P(t) to obtain, : \\\\mathbf{C} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{b}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{d} - \\\\mathbf{b}\\\\times(\\\\mathbf{b}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{d})}{2\\\\mathbf{b}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{b}}. The screw axis of this spatial displacement has the Pl√ºcker coordinates . Dual quaternion The screw axis appears in the dual quaternion formulation of a spatial displacement . The dual quaternion is constructed from the dual vector defining the screw axis and the dual angle , where œÜ is the rotation about and d the slide along this axis, which defines the displacement D to obtain, : \\\\hat{S} = \\\\cos\\\\frac{\\\\hat{\\\\varphi}}{2} + \\\\sin\\\\frac{\\\\hat{\\\\varphi}}{2} \\\\mathsf{S}. A spatial displacement of points q represented as a vector quaternion can be defined using quaternions as the mapping :\\\\mathbf{q} \\\\mapsto S\\\\mathbf{q}S^{-1} + \\\\mathbf{d} where d is translation vector quaternion and S is a unit quaternion, also called a versor, given by :S=\\\\cos \\\\theta + \\\\mathbf{S} \\\\sin \\\\theta , \\\\ \\\\ \\\\mathbf{S}^2 = -1 , that defines a rotation by 2Œ∏ around an axis S. In the proper Euclidean group E+(3) a rotation may be conjugated with a translation to move it to a parallel rotation axis. Such a conjugation, using quaternion homographies, produces the appropriate screw axis to express the given spatial displacement as a screw displacement, in accord with Chasles‚Äô theorem. Mechanics The motion of a rigid body may be the combination of rotation about an axis (the screw axis) and a translation along that axis. This screw move is characterized by the velocity vector for the translation and the angular velocity vector in the same or opposite direction. If these two vectors are constant and along one of the principal axes of the body, no external forces are needed for this motion (moving and spinning). As an example, if gravity and drag are ignored, this is the motion of a bullet fired from a rifled gun. =Biomechanics= This parameter is often used in biomechanics, when describing the motion of joints of the body. For any period of time, joint motion can be seen as the movement of a single point on one articulating surface with respect to the adjacent surface (usually distal with respect to proximal). The total translation and rotations along the path of motion can be defined as the time integrals of the instantaneous translation and rotation velocities at the IHA for a given reference time.Woltring HJ, de Lange A, Kauer JMG, Huiskes R. 1987 Instantaneous helical axes estimation via natural, cross-validated splines.

The early studies were denoted \\"Phase A\\", and in June 1970, \\"Phase B\\", which were more detailed and specific. The primary intended use of the Space Shuttle was supporting the future space station, ferrying a minimum crew of four and about of cargo, and able to be rapidly turned around for future flights. Two designs emerged as front-runners. One was designed by engineers at the Manned Spaceflight Center, and championed especially by George Mueller. This was a two-stage system with delta-winged spacecraft, and generally complex. An attempt to re-simplify was made in the form of the DC-3, designed by Maxime Faget, who had designed the Mercury capsule among other vehicles. Numerous offerings from a variety of commercial companies were also offered, but generally fell by the wayside as each NASA lab pushed for its own version. All of this was taking place in the midst of other NASA teams proposing a wide variety of post-Apollo missions, a number of which would cost as much as Apollo or more. As each of these projects fought for funding, the NASA budget was at the same time being severely constrained. Three were eventually presented to Vice President Agnew in 1969. The shuttle project rose to the top, largely due to tireless campaigning by its supporters. By 1970 the shuttle had been selected as the one major project for the short-term post- Apollo time frame. When funding for the program came into question, there were concerns that the project might be cancelled. This led to an effort to interest the US Air Force in using the shuttle for their missions as well. The Air Force was mildly interested, but demanded a much larger vehicle, far larger than the original concepts. To lower the development costs of the resulting designs, boosters were added, a throw-away fuel tank was adopted, and many other changes made that greatly lowered the reusability and greatly added to vehicle and operational costs. With the Air Force's assistance, the system emerged in its operational form.  Decision-making process  In 1969, United States Vice President Spiro Agnew chaired the National Aeronautics and Space Council, which discussed post-Apollo options for human space activities. The recommendations of the Council would heavily influence the decisions of the administration. The Council considered four major options: * A human mission to Mars * follow-on lunar program * A low earth orbital infrastructure program * Discontinuing human space activities Based on the advice of the Space Council, President Nixon made the decision to pursue the low earth orbital infrastructure option. This program mainly consisted of construction of a space station, along with the development of a Space Shuttle. Funding restrictions precluded pursuing the development of both programs simultaneously, however. NASA chose to develop the Space Shuttle program first, and then planned to use the shuttle in order to construct and service a space station.  Shuttle design debate  Original North American Rockwell Shuttle delta wing design, 1969: fully reusable, with a flyback manned booster Maxime Faget's DC-3 concept employed conventional straight wings. During the early shuttle studies, there was a debate over the optimal shuttle design that best balanced capability, development cost, and operational cost. Initially a fully reusable design was preferred. This involved a very large winged manned booster which would carry a smaller winged manned orbiter. The booster vehicle would lift the orbiter to a certain altitude and speed, then separate. The booster would return and land horizontally, while the orbiter continued into low earth orbit. After completing its mission, the winged orbiter would reenter and land horizontally on a runway. The idea was that full reusability would promote lower operating costs. However, further studies showed a huge booster was needed to lift an orbiter with the desired payload capability. In space and aviation systems, cost is closely related to weight, so this meant the overall vehicle cost would be very high. Both booster and orbiter would have rocket engines plus jet engines for use within the atmosphere, plus separate fuel and control systems for each propulsion mode. In addition there were concurrent discussions about how much funding would be available to develop the program. Another competing approach was maintaining the Saturn V production line and using its large payload capacity to launch a space station in a few payloads rather than many smaller shuttle payloads. A related concept was servicing the space station using the Air Force Titan III-M to launch a larger Gemini capsule, called \\"Big Gemini‚Äù, or a smaller ‚Äúglider‚Äù version of the shuttle with no main engines and a 15‚Äôby 30‚Äô payload bay. The shuttle supporters answered that given enough launches, a reusable system would have lower overall costs than disposable rockets. If dividing total program costs over a given number of launches, a high shuttle launch rate would result in lower per-launch costs. This in turn would make the shuttle cost competitive with or superior to expendable launchers. Some theoretical studies mentioned 55 shuttle launches per year, however the final design chosen would not support that launch rate. In particular the maximum external tank production rate was limited to 24 tanks per year at NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility. The combined space station and Air Force payload requirements weren't sufficient to reach desired shuttle launch rates. Therefore, the plan was for all future U.S. space launches‚Äîspace station, Air Force, commercial satellites, and scientific research‚Äîto use only the space shuttle. Most other expendable boosters would be phased out. The reusable booster was eventually abandoned due to several factors: high price (combined with limited funding), technical complexity, and development risk. Instead, a partially (not fully) reusable design was selected, where an external propellent tank was discarded for each launch, and the booster rockets and shuttle orbiter were refurbished for reuse. Initially the orbiter was to carry its own liquid propellant. However studies showed carrying the propellant in an external tank allowed a larger payload bay in an otherwise much smaller craft. It also meant throwing away the tank after each launch, but this was a relatively small portion of operating costs. Earlier designs assumed the winged orbiter would also have jet engines to assist maneuvering in the atmosphere after reentering. However NASA ultimately chose a gliding orbiter, based partially on experience from previous rocket-then-glide vehicles such as the X-15 and lifting bodies. Omitting the jet engines and their fuel would reduce complexity and increase payload. Another decision was the size of the crew. Some said that the shuttle should not carry more than four, the most that could use ejection seats. A commander, pilot, mission specialist, and payload specialist were sufficient for any mission. NASA expected to carry more space flight participants as payload specialists, so designed the vehicle to carry more. The last remaining debate was over the nature of the boosters. NASA examined four solutions to this problem: development of the existing Saturn lower stage, simple pressure- fed liquid-fuel engines of a new design, a large single solid rocket, or two (or more) smaller ones. Engineers at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (where the Saturn V development was managed) were particularly concerned about solid rocket reliability for manned missions.  Air Force involvement  During the mid-1960s the United States Air Force had both of its major piloted space projects, X-20 Dyna-Soar and Manned Orbiting Laboratory, canceled. This demonstrated its need to cooperate with NASA to place military astronauts in orbit. In turn, by serving Air Force needs, the Shuttle became a truly national system, carrying all military as well as civilian payloads.Day, Dwayne A. \\"Big Black and the new bird: the NRO and the early Space Shuttle\\" The Space Review, 11 January 2010. NASA sought Air Force support for the shuttle. After the Six-Day War and the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia exposed limitations in the United States' satellite reconnaissance network, Air Force involvement emphasized the ability to launch spy satellites southward into polar orbit from Vandenberg AFB. This required higher energies than for lower inclination orbits. The Air Force also hoped that a shuttle could retrieve Soviet satellites and quickly land. It thus desired the ability to land at the Vandenberg liftoff point after one orbit, despite the earth rotating 1,000 miles beneath the orbital track. This required a larger delta wing size than the earlier simple \\"DC-3\\" shuttle. However NASA also desired this increased maneuvering capability since further studies had shown the DC-3 shuttle design had limitations not initially foreseen. The Air Force launched more than 200 satellite reconnaissance missions between 1959 and 1970, and the military's large volume of payloads would be valuable in making the shuttle more economical. Despite the potential benefits for the Air Force, the military was satisfied with its expendable boosters and did not need or want the shuttle as much as NASA did. Because the space agency needed outside support, the Defense Department (DoD) and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) gained primary control over the design process. For example, NASA planned a cargo bay, but NRO specified a bay because it expected future intelligence satellites to become larger. When Faget again proposed a 12-foot wide payload bay, the military almost immediately insisted on retaining the 15-foot width. The Air Force also gained the equivalent of use of one of the shuttles for free despite not paying for the shuttle's development or construction. In exchange for the NASA concessions, the Air Force testified to the Senate Space Committee on the shuttle's behalf in March 1971.Day, Dwayne A. \\"The spooks and the turkey\\" The Space Review, 20 November 2006. As another incentive for the military to use the shuttle, Congress reportedly told DoD that it would not pay for any satellites not designed to fit into the shuttle cargo bay. Although NRO did not redesign existing satellites for the shuttle, the vehicle retained the ability to retrieve large cargos such as the KH-9 HEXAGON from orbit for refurbishment, and the agency studied resupplying the satellite in space. The Air Force planned on having its own fleet of shuttles, and re-built a separate launch facility originally derived from the canceled Manned Orbiting Laboratory program at Vandenberg called Space Launch Complex Six (SLC-6). However, for various reasons, due in large part to the loss of Space Shuttle Challenger on January 28, 1986, work on SLC-6 was eventually discontinued with no shuttle launches from that location ever taking place. SLC-6 was eventually used for launching the Lockheed Martin-built Athena expendable launch vehicles, which included the successful IKONOS commercial Earth observation satellite in September 1999 before being reconfigured once again to handle the new generation of Boeing Delta IV's. The first launch of the Delta IV heavy from SLC-6 occurred in June 2006, launching NROL-22, a classified satellite for the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office (NRO).  Final design  Final semi-reusable design with throwaway external fuel tank and recoverable solid rocket boosters While NASA would likely have chosen liquid boosters had it complete control over the design, the Office of Management and Budget insisted on less expensive solid boosters due to their lower projected development costs.NASA-CR-134338, Mead, L. M., et al Space Shuttle System Program Definition Phase B Extension Final Report. Washington, DC: National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 1972. While a liquid-fueled booster design provided better performance, lower per-flight costs, less environmental impact and less developmental risk, solid boosters were seen as requiring less funding to develop at a time when the Shuttle program had many different elements competing for limited development funds. The final design which was selected was a winged orbiter with three liquid-fueled engines, a large expendable external tank which held liquid propellant for these engines, and two reusable solid rocket boosters. In the spring of 1972 Lockheed Aircraft, McDonnell Douglas, Grumman, and North American Rockwell submitted proposals to build the shuttle. The NASA selection group thought that Lockheed's shuttle was too complex and too expensive, and the company had no experience with building manned spacecraft. McDonnell Douglas's was too expensive and had technical issues. Grumman had an excellent design which also seemed too expensive. North American's shuttle had the lowest cost and most realistic cost projections, its design was the easiest for ongoing maintenance, and the Apollo 13 accident involving North American's command and service module demonstrated its experience with electrical system failures. NASA announced its choice of North American on 26 July 1972. The Space Shuttle program used the HAL/S programming language. The first microprocessor used was the 8088 and later the 80386. The space shuttle orbiter avionics computer was the IBM AP-101.  Retrospection after three decades  Early concept of how the Space Shuttle was to be serviced Opinions differ on the lessons of the Shuttle. It was developed with the original development cost and time estimates given to President Richard M. Nixon in 1971, at a cost of US$6.744 billion in 1971 dollars versus an original $5.15 billion estimate. The operational costs, flight rate, payload capacity, and reliability have been different than anticipated, however.

Established in 1976 in the Bhal region of Saurashtra, the park is located around 42 km from the district headquarters city of Bhavnagar. Hugging the coasts of the Gulf of Khambhat on the south, it is spread over an area of 34.08 km2, which was primarily a \\"vidi\\" (grassland) of the maharaja of the princely state of Bhavnagar for hunting the blackbucks with his famous hunting cheetahs. On the northern side, it is surrounded by wastelands and agriculture fields. The national park has been classified as 4B Gujarat-Rajwada biotic province of semi-arid bio-geographical zone. Flat land, dry grasses and herds of antelope have always attracted visitors to this park which has a grassland ecosystem. Successful conservation programs for the blackbuck, wolf and lesser florican (a bustard) are ongoing. Considered to be an endemic Indian species, the lesser florican, which once lived throughout the country, has become endangered in recent decades. Today, the largest population is in this park. Local wolf numbers are increasing, as are striped hyena, with sightings quite frequent during daylight in winter 2012-2013. Geography Map of Velavadar National Park In July 1976, when the park was established, the initial protected area measured about 18 km2. In 1980, another 16 km2 were added, increasing the total area to 34.08 km2. A southern portion of the park, which adjoins the Gulf of Khambhat, is in the Gulf's high tide zone and gets inundated with water. However, its semi-arid conditions, together with this inundation of seawater during monsoon, creates habitats suitable for various dependent fauna of the park. According to a remote sensing study of habitat types, the park area is classified as follows: * 7.57 km2 of dense grassland * 9.91 km2 of sparse grassland * 5.05 km2 of Prosopis shrubland * 5.13 km2 of saline land * 5.08 km2 of high tidal mudflats The mudflats are the high tide zones of Gulf of Khambhat and the lower part is prone to flooding. Wildlife Indian Wolf at Velavadar (Blackbuck National Park, Gujarat) The fauna population of the park mainly includes blackbucks, wolves, Macqueen's bustards, hyenas and lesser floricans, with foxes, jackals and jungle cats as the main carnivores. Other species include wild pigs, hares and rodents typical of the savannah type grasslands and thorn scrubs. Among birds, sandgrouse and larks are seen in fair numbers. According to Roger Geoffrey Clarke, the British harrier-expert, the harrier roost found at the park is one of the largest in the world.

The period from late October to the end of March is recommended for visitors. The best time to visit is from December to March as many species of migratory, including three species of harriers, the lesser florican, eagles and waders, migrate back. Bhavnagar Airport is connected with Mumbai by daily flights. The closest international airport is Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at 153 km by road. The closest railway station is at the town of Dhola, which is about 50 km from the park. The ancient town of Vallabhi is about 30 km away.

It runs from Pulteney Street to East Terrace, where it becomes Rundle Road through the East Park Lands. (A separate Rundle Street continues from Rundle Road through Kent Town). Its former western extent, which ran to King William Street, was closed in 1972 to form the pedestrian street of Rundle Mall. The street is close to Adelaide Botanic Gardens, Rundle Park, Rymill Park, Hindmarsh Square and North Terrace. The street was named after John Rundle, a director of the South Australia Company and member of the British House of Commons, by the Street Naming Committee on 23 May 1837. It was installed with the first electric street lighting in South Australia in 1895 at the former intersection of Rundle, King William and Hindley streets. The street contains numerous caf√©s, restaurants, shops, cinemas, clubs and hotels. It is one of Adelaide's most popular streets for caf√©s and fashion. Most of the street has a heritage fa√ßade, but has been redeveloped for modern use, with some buildings converted to residences, such as the East End Markets. The street is two-lane with parking on both sides plus bicycle lanes. A tramline ran through the street in the early 20th century. It is one of the narrower streets of the Adelaide grid, at wide. Rundle Lantern The south-east corner of Rundle and Pulteney street was for much of the 20th century the site of a six-storey Victorian-style building opened as the Grand Central Hotel in 1911 for the Melbourne retail firm of Foy & Gibson and designed to complement their furniture emporium adjacent. The Grand Central in its turn replaced the elegant and exclusive two-storey York Hotel, but despite some high-profile guests (the Prince of Wales in 1920, Arthur Conan Doyle in 1922), it never prospered, and around 1925 was absorbed into the emporium. The building was sold to the Electricity Trust for showrooms and offices, then in 1975‚Äì1976 was demolished to make way for a multi-level car park, an open, austere structure of concrete slabs and iron railings.

It belongs to the order of toothcarps (Cyprinodontiformes), and therein the large suborder Cyprinodontoidei. Most of its closest living relatives are egg-laying, with the notable exception of the splitfin livebearers (Goodeidae). They are usually smallish; most species reaching a length of at most 4 in (10 cm) when fully grown. However, a few larger species exist, with the giant killifish (F. grandissimus) and the northern studfish (F. catenatus) growing to twice the genus' average size. Many of the 40-odd species are commonly known by the highly ambiguous name \\"killifish\\" (the general term for egg-laying toothcarps), or the somewhat less ambiguous \\"topminnow\\" (a catch-all term for Fundulidae). \\"Studfish\\" is a quite unequivocal vernacular name applied to some other Fundulus species; it is not usually used to refer to the genus as a whole, however. Fundulus have evolved to occupy a wide range of aquatic ecosystems, including marine, estuarine, and freshwater, making it a good comparative model system for studying evolutionary divergence between marine and freshwater environments. To assist with this research, Oxford Nanopore long-read reference genomes have been sequenced for F. xenicus, F. catenatus, F. nottii, and F. olivaceus.

Apart from the botanical garden, some of the other attractions include local tribes, \\"Gira Falls\\", and the \\"Conservation center\\". As a part of developing ecotourism Gujarat Government has developed a campsite at Kilad. There is also a deer breeding center maintained by Nature Club Surat in this region. The best time to visit is post-monsoon season till winter when the forests are lush green and streams are full. Fauna Animals found in the park include the Indian leopard, dhole, rhesus macaque, common palm civet, Hanuman langur, small Indian civet, four-horned antelope, wild boar, Indian porcupine, barking deer, striped hyena, jungle cat, flying squirrel, pangolin and Indian giant squirrel. Pythons and venomous snakes such as the Russell's viper, cobras and kraits can also be found. In 1992, a rusty-spotted cat was spotted in a farmhouse at a plantation of mangoes in this park. In February 2020, dholes were sighted in the park, with camera traps confirming the presence of two individuals in May 2020. This was the first time in 50 years that dholes were confirmed in Gujarat.

His son is credited as the founder of the Wu-style t'ai chi ch'uan. As he was of Manchu descent, and would have been named by his family in Manchu, the name \\"W√∫\\" (Âê≥) was a sinicisation that approximated the pronunciation of the first syllable of his Manchu clan name, U Hala. Background Wu was a military officer in the Yellow Banner camp (see Qing Dynasty Military) in the Forbidden City, Beijing and also an officer of the Imperial Guards Brigade during the Qing Dynasty. At that time, Yang Luchan (1799‚Äì1872) was the martial arts instructor in that banner camp, teaching t'ai chi ch'uan. In the camp, there were many officers studying with Yang Luchan, but only three men, Wan Chun (Ëê¨Êò•), Ling Shan (ÂáåÂ±±) and Ch'uan Yu (ÂÖ®‰Ωë) studied diligently and trained hard enough at t'ai chi ch'uan to become disciples. However, they were unable to become Yang Luchan's disciples, because Yang Luchan taught t'ai chi ch'uan to two men of very high status in the military; they were Shi Shaonan and General Yue Guichen. At that time Wan Chun, Ling Shan and Ch'uan-yu were middle grade officers in the banner camp and because of their rank, they could not be seen as classmates with nobility and high grade officers. As a result, they were asked to become disciples of Yang Pan-hou or Yang Banhou, Yang Luchan's oldest adult son and an instructor as well to the Manchu military. As a teacher When Wu retired from the military, he set up a school in Beijing. Wu's Beijing school was successful and there were many who studied with him, he was popularly known as Quan Sanye (ÂÖ®‰∏âÁà∫) as a term of respect. His disciples were his son Wu Chien-ch'uan, Guo Songting (ÈÉ≠Êùæ‰∫≠), Wang Mao Zhai(ÁéãËåÇÈΩã), Xia Gongfu (Â§èÂÖ¨Áî´), Chang Yuanting (1860-1918; Â∏∏ÈÅ†‰∫≠), Qi Gechen (ÈΩäÈñ£Ëá£) (see Wudang t'ai chi ch'uan Lineage) etc. Wu's skills were said to be exceptional in the area of softly \\"neutralising\\" (ÂåñÂãÅ, hua jin) hard energy when attacked, which is a core skill of good t'ai chi ch'uan practice as a martial art. Chang Yuanting's son, Chang Yunji teaches a style known as quanyou laojia tai chi chuan (ÂÖ®‰ΩëËÄÅÊû∂Â§™ÊûÅÊã≥) or Chang style tai chi chuan (Â∏∏Ê∞èÂ§™Ê•µÊã≥). Formation of the Wu-style Wu's son, Wu Chien-ch'uan (1870‚Äì1942) also became a cavalry officer and t'ai chi ch'uan teacher, working closely with the Yang family and Sun Lu-t'ang, promoting what subsequently came to be known as Wu-style t'ai chi ch'uan in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong.

Club career Born in Ougr√©e, Seraing, Goossens started playing professionally with R.F.C. Seraing at the age of 16, then moved to Standard Li√®ge. In the 1992‚Äì93 campaign he won the Young Professional Footballer of the Year award whilst, alongside Philippe L√©onard and R√©gis Genaux, being part of The Three Musketeers generation (with Roberto Bisconti playing a smaller role), hailed for their sporting talent but with a troublesome character. In September 1996, after helping Standard to two league runner-up places and the 1993 Belgian Cup, Goossens signed for Genoa C.F.C. in Italy, but only lasted there one season, as the Liguria team failed to promote from Serie B. In the following three years, he played in Germany with FC Schalke 04, being used sparingly during his spell and sharing team with compatriots Nico van Kerckhoven (two years) and Marc Wilmots (three). With the Gelsenkirchen club, Goossens notably scored in the quarterfinals of the 1997‚Äì98 UEFA Cup against Inter Milan, but the defending champions were eventually ousted after losing 1‚Äì0 away and a 1‚Äì1 home draw; with three goals, he was the best scorer in European competition for Schalke, but only netted five times in two-and-a-half seasons combined in the Bundesliga. In the 2000 January transfer window Goossens returned to Standard, exchanged for compatriot √âmile Mpenza. He helped the team reach the final of the cup in 2000, regaining his previous form and scoring more than 40 official goals. Goossens then moved abroad again, aged nearly 30, spending one season in Austria with Grazer AK, who won the first ‚Äì and only ‚Äì double in its history, finishing one point ahead of FK Austria Wien which were also the losing side in the domestic cup.

(2008). Castles of the Clans: The Strongholds and Seats of 750 Scottish Families and Clans. pp. 441. . It is a white washed mansion that incorporates an old tower house with gun loops. The castle was held by the Clan Munro from the twelfth century or earlier and they had a stronghold there. The remains of an 11th- century Motte (man-made mound topped by a wooden palisade), believed to be the first fortification at Foulis, still remain in the castle grounds today. Early history Entrance to Foulis Castle, note the golden eagles on each pillar, symbols of the Clan Munro Foulis Castle itself is mentioned briefly in records that date back to the 14th century although the original Tower of Foulis was believed to have been built in 1154. It is recorded by contemporary evidence that Uilleam III, Earl of Ross granted a charter to Robert de Munro of Foulis for the lands of \\"Estirfowlys\\" with the \\"Tower of Strathskehech\\" from 1350.Munro, R.W. (1987). Mapping the Clan Munro. Published by the Clan Munro Association. Printed by Lindsay & Co. Ltd. Edinburgh. It is also recorded that Euphemia I, Countess of Ross granted two charters to Robert's son, Hugh Munro, 9th Baron of Foulis in 1394. One of them dated 4 May 1394 is in respect of the \\"Wesstir Fowlys\\" and the \\"Tower of Strathschech\\", named so because of the River Sgitheach that passes through nearby Strath Skiach and into the Cromarty Firth. A document signed and sealed at Foulis Castle in 1491 reads in Gaelic \\"caisteal biorach, nead na h-iolair\\", which means \\"castle gaunt-peaked, the eagle's nest\\". This is in allusion to the clan chief's heraldic emblem. In 1542 Donald Mackay of Strathnaver, chief of the Clan Mackay was imprisoned in Foulis Castle, when he was captured after the Battle of Alltan-Beath.Mackenzie, Alexander. (1898). History of the Munros of Fowlis. pp. 40 ‚Äì 43. According to Fraser's Wardlaw manuscript written in the 17th century, because of the Munro's kindness and civility towards Donald Mackay \\"to this day\\" a correspondence was linked between the Munros and Mackays.Fraser, James. (1674). Chronicles of the Frasers: the Wardlaw manuscript entitled 'Polichronicon seu policratica temporum, or, The true genealogy of the Frasers, 916‚Äì1674. Originally written in about 1674. Re- published in 1905 by William Mackay. pp. 132 ‚Äì 135. The castles \\"tower and fortalice\\" are also mentioned in a charter from the crown in 1587. In times of clan warfare, a signal beacon was lit on the highest tower of Foulis Castle to gather the clan under arms, hence the Munro slogan or gathering cry of \\"Caisteal Foghlais na theine,\\" meaning Castle Foulis ablaze. The castle survived up to the 18th century until it was attacked by Jacobites in 1746. Sir Robert Munro, 6th Baronet was killed at the Battle of Falkirk Muir in 1746 and the castle was sacked and burned by the Jacobites in the same year. Robert's son the next successive chief, Sir Harry Munro, 7th Baronet returned home from captivity to find the castle had been set on fire and much of the castle had been destroyed. The Jacobites were defeated just a few months later by Government forces at the Battle of Culloden. Sir Harry Munro set about rebuilding the castle incorporating what he could of the original building. However as the Battle of Culloden had brought a complete end to the Highland clan system there was no need for such a defensive fort anymore. As with many castles at this time it was re-built as a large mansion house as we see it today. The castle was re-built as a large classical mansion between 1754 and 1792. Foulis Castle still remains the home of the Chief of Munro, Hector W Munro of Foulis. However the most recent baronets of Foulis-Obsdale have lived in Southern England. Restoration Some of the original castle fortifications showing under later walled construction No records survive of what the fortifications at Castle Foulis looked like before 1746. Some evidence was discovered in the 1746 restoration. It is thought that the castle was surrounded by a series of smaller dwellings, of possibly a fortified nature. They found in 1957‚Äì59 evidence to suggest that in the courtyard area horses and cattle were kept, and that it was a self-contained community able to withstand a siege when attacked. The Tower was a fortification, as its walls at the ground level are five feet six inches thick. In May 1985, while repairs were being carried out in part to the Courtyard building, Four \\"cannon loops of an inverted key hole type,\\" dating from the early part of the 16th century, were discovered behind four wedge-shaped, blocked-up apertures facing north, south, east and west in the wall. Above them is a barrel-vaulted stone ceiling. This building, at one time separate from the Castle, had certainly been constructed as a small defensive fort with an all-round \\"field of fire\\" to guard against possible attack. At some later date, perhaps after 1746 and when the Chief felt that the chances of attack had lessened, the use of this building had changed. Three of the apertures had been completely blocked while the fourth had been partially blocked, leaving a narrow slit six inches wide and three feet long, into which a three-quarter-inch iron bar was strongly built, giving light, some air and access through which food could be passed to the unfortunate prisoner. It was likely the castle's gaol. According to Munro sources, some of the stone wall of the original castle was found under the plaster of the current main mansion house building at Foulis.

It opened in 1882 and is one of two remaining branch lines in Southland, and one of only a few in the country. A number of smaller privately owned railways fanned out from Wairio; one of these lines, to Ohai, was worked by New Zealand Railways from 1990 and incorporated into the national network in 1992.  Construction  =Construction of the Wairio Branch= Built at about the same time as the Riverton section of the Tuatapere Branch, what became the Wairio Branch left the Tuatapere Branch at Thornbury, where the junction originally faced Riverton rather than Invercargill, implying that the developers might have thought Riverton was going to be the region's major port. The line was built to open up new land to settlement and agricultural use and to access coal deposits. In 1879 it was opened to Otautau, and to Wairio on 3 March 1882, where it connected with private railways. When the Tuatapere Branch closed in 1978 the Thornbury to Makarewa section became part of the Wairio Branch, and the closure of the Kingston Branch in 1982 meant that the continuation line to Invercargill section was also incorporated into the branch. This latter section of line is one of the oldest in New Zealand; built with wooden rails, it opened in 1864. =Construction of the private coal lines from Wairio= The development of private railway lines beyond Wairio was somewhat complex. The first was established not long after the Wairio Branch was opened and was a privately owned extension of a little over two miles to the Nightcaps Coal Company in nearby Nightcaps, and operated by the Railways Department. The roads in the Ohai area in 1909 were described as \\"unspeakably bad\\" in a publication of the Ohai Railway Board in 1925; although significant coal deposits were in the area, it was difficult and hardly viable to transport the coal the short distance to the railway in Nightcaps. For this reason, another line from Wairio was proposed, but delays and negotiations meant that it did not open until June 1914. This line was operated by the Wairio Railway & Coal Company (WR&CC;) and it served two additional mines in Moretown, a locality south of Ohai, but like the Nightcaps railway line, it did not provide reasonable access to Ohai's mines. Thus a third line was required. While the WR&CC;'s line was under construction, mining interests in Ohai united to present a petition that the government acquire the WR&CC; line and extend it into Ohai. Unfortunately, the arguments in favour of this proposal were presented to a parliamentary committee in 1914 just as World War I broke out and further consideration of the proposal was postponed. However, later that year the Local Railways Act was passed and, despite objections from the Nightcaps Coal Company and others in Nightcaps, the Ohai Railway District was declared on 4 May 1916. The declaration of this District included a condition that the Ohai Railway Board had to acquire the WR&CC; line before constructing any new railway. The case for acquisition went to a compensation court, and, upon paying the sum of 19,862 pounds 6 shillings and 6 pence, the Ohai Railway Board took control of the WR&CC; line on 22 June 1917. The trackage acquired from the WR&CC; was built to the low standards of a bush tramway, unsatisfactory as a permanent line. It could not even be appropriately extended into Ohai, though in 1919 an extension of 1 5/8 miles was opened to serve mines in the locality of Mossbank. In 1918 a proposal to build a third line directly from Wairio to Ohai was made, and it included a small deviation through Morley Village, considered part of Nightcaps. The construction of the line was opposed by the Nightcaps Coal Company, but after two commissions were held, approval was granted and construction commenced in July 1919. The first section was opened for traffic to Tinkers on 1 September 1920, but due to difficulties with the terrain it was not completed to Ohai until December 1924 and opened to traffic in the new year. In 1934 the line reached its ultimate terminus of Birchwood, 19 kilometres from Wairio. As the railway was built to national standards, the Ohai Railway Board suggested that the government could acquire it as the start of a route northwards to Lakes Te Anau and Manapouri, but nothing came of this. Operation Freight trains off the Wairio Branch were largely industrial, and passengers were carried from Wairio to Invercargill from the line's opening until well into the 20th century. Due to decay of the old WR&CC; line, the Railways Department stated that it would not permit its wagons to be used on the line after 31 December 1924, and thus the timing of the opening of the line to Ohai at the start of January 1925 proved to be fortuitous as it could carry traffic from the mines that had previously utilised the WR&CC; route. Later in 1925 the Nightcaps Coal Company shut down operations and its railway extension was acquired by the Railways Department, which dismantled it in 1926. The Ohai Railway Board used locomotives bought from the Railways Department as motive power - initially one C and two FA class locomotives, later replaced by an X class tender engine and a WAB class tank locomotive. Upon dieselisation in the 1960s, small diesel shunters such as a DSA class were used, and then a DJ class locomotive was employed. In the early 1990s, the Ohai line was incorporated into the national network and the line beyond Wairio became known as the Ohai Industrial Line. The motive power used on the line from this stage was the same as that employed to haul the train from Invercargill. Presently, one train runs every weekday from Invercargill and return, arriving at Ohai at 9.30am and leaving two hours later. This service operates on Saturdays and Sundays when required. In June 2007, the Southland District Council adopted as part of the Otago Regional Land Transport Strategy a provision to upgrade the Ohai line and maintain it as a viable alternative to a road for bulk freight.Amy Milne, \\"District council adopts road strategy\\", Southland Times, 12 July 2007. On 15 May 2008 Fonterra and Eastern Coal Holdings reached an agreement to continue to rail coal from Eastern Coal's Takitimu mining operations in the Ohai/Nightcaps district to Fonterra's Clandeboye dairy factory. Under this new contract, approximately 120,000 tonnes of coal will be carried annually by the Ohai line.New Zealand Press Association, \\"Toll Carriage Of Coal Supply For Clandeboye May Spur New Line\\" (15 May 2008), accessed 16 May 2008. After infrastructural upgrades such as a new rail load-out system were undertaken, the contract came into effect on 1 September 2008; to fulfil it, trainloads of up to 550 tonnes of coal leave the Branch daily. In 2011, KiwiRail undertook a refurbishment of the line with a large resleepering and bridge strengthening projects to allow larger, heavier, containerised coal trains to operate, while allowing for an increase in speed. This work was completed in late 2012.

In his mid-20s ‚Äì since leaving the latter team in late 2004 ‚Äì however, he did not settle with any team until his retirement. Club career Stoica was born in Bucharest, Romania. In 1996, as a 16-year-old, he arrived in Belgium signing with first division club R.S.C. Anderlecht, from local side FC Steaua Bucure»ôti. He quickly became a fan favorite (being nicknamed \\"Le Petit Prince du Parc Astrid\\"). From 1999 to 2001, as the Brussels outfit won back-to-back national championships, he contributed with 44 games and 13 goals combined, winning the Young Football of the Year award in the latter season. However, after Anderlecht chairman Roger Vanden Stock refused to award him a new contract with a huge pay rise, Stoica left Anderlecht and signed with league rivals Club Brugge KV, just before the beginning of the 2002‚Äì03 campaign. After 19 matches and five goals to help Brugge clinch the league title in his debut season, he gradually fell out of favour and left the club in January 2005, playing with a further two outfits that season, Serie A's A.C. Siena (no appearances) and FC Na≈£ional Bucure»ôti. In the winter of 2006, Stoica moved to FC Timi≈üoara, at the request of Gheorghe Hagi, the team's manager. After a good debut, he caused a bit of turmoil and was sent to the second team due to what was deemed as unprofessional behavior.

It occurs as thin margins on the lava flow surfaces and between pillow lavas as well as in thicker deposits, more commonly associated with explosive, volatile-rich eruptions as well as steeper topography. Hyaloclastites form during volcanic eruptions under water, under ice or where subaerial flows reach the sea or other bodies of water. It commonly has the appearance of angular flat fragments sized between a millimeter to few centimeters. The fragmentation occurs by the force of the volcanic explosion, or by thermal shock and spallation during rapid cooling. Several minerals are found in hyaloclastite masses. Sideromelane is a basalt glass rapidly quenched in water. It is transparent and pure, lacking the iron oxide crystals dispersed in the more commonly occurring tachylite. Fragments of these glasses are usually surrounded by a yellow waxy layer of palagonite, formed by reaction of sideromelane with water. Hyaloclastite ridges, formed by subglacial eruptions during the last glacial period, are a prominent landscape feature of Iceland and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Hyaloclastite is usually found at subglacial volcanoes, such as tuyas, which is a type of distinctive, flat-topped, steep-sided volcano formed when lava erupts through a thick glacier or ice sheet. In lava deltas, hyaloclastites form the main constituent of foresets formed ahead of the expanding delta. The foresets fill in the seabed topography, eventually building up to sea level, allowing the subaerial flow to move forwards until it reaches the sea again.Naylor, P.H., Bell, B.R., Jolley, D.W., Purnall, P. & Fredsted, R. 1999.

It falls under the command of the 1st Marine Division and I Marine Expeditionary Force.  Insignia  The coat of arms of the 1st Tank Battalion is a jousting shield of blue with a scarlet border and a large numeral \\"1\\" (in the 1st Marine Division font) in scarlet behind an M2A4 tank painted as used at Guadalcanal during World War II all behind a diagonal lightning bolt (striking from the shields upper left to the shields lower right). The crest is a Marine Corps emblem of silver and gold contained within a green laurel. A gold banner above the arms is inscribed \\"First Tank Battalion\\" and another below the arms inscribed \\"August- Guadalcanal-1942\\" in scarlet. The battle of Guadalcanal began in August 1942 and was the first combat action of the battalion and the M2A4 tank was the first tank used by the battalion. Additionally, the battalion was the only American military unit to ever use the M2A4 tank in battle. The use of this tank memorializes the first combat action of the battalion. The jousting shield is a unique device of mounted and armored warriors and has the upper corner cut away to better wield one's weapons. The colors of the shield and the 1st Marine Division numeral \\"1\\" identify the battalion with its parent division. The lightning bolt represents speed, shock effect and firepower. The laurel, in the crest, is an award of honor, recalling the courage, valor and sacrifices of the battalion. This coat of arms has existed in Marine Corps records‚Äîin varied forms‚Äîsince at least 1970. Other variations exist, often placing the emblems from the coat of arms (the number \\"1\\", the tank and lightning bolt) on a differently shaped shield or on the diamond insignia of the 1st Marine Division, often substituting a more modern tank for the original and sometimes rearranging the emblems. This latter device (the number \\"1\\", tank, and lightning bolt upon the diamond insignia of the 1st Marine Division) is commonly used as the distinctive unit insignia (or DUI, a badge- type device) of the battalion.

History The 1st Tank Battalion was activated on 1 November 1941 at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina and was attached to the 1st Marine Division. At this time, Headquarters and Service Company and Company B were organized. Company A had been in existence prior to this activation. This unit was originally activated on 1 August 1940 as the 3d Tank Company. It was reorganized and redesignated as Company A, 1st Tank Battalion, on 1 May 1941. Other companies of the battalion were later activated in early 1942. =World War II= After the outbreak of World War II the unit subsequently was ordered to the South Pacific and began movement to the area in the Spring of 1942. Companies from the battalion were eventually deployed to Samoa and New Zealand. The first combat operation for units from the battalion was the Guadalcanal campaign, in which they were equipped with the predecessor of the famed M3 Stuart light tank; the M2A4 light tank. On 7 August 1942, Companies A and B took part in the 1st Marine Division's landings on the Japanese held island. The next month saw, M2A4 light tanks from the battalion supporting infantry units in the Battle of Bloody Ridge. The two companies continued to engage the enemy until the end of the year when the 1st Marine Division was relieved by the Army forces. The 1st Tank Battalion's campaign during this period was unique, in that the only combat experienced by the M2A4 light tank in World War II, by US forces, was while assigned to the US Marine Corps 1st Tank Battalion.Zaloga, p. 15, 27 (Plate C) The division was then moved to Australia in January 1943 where units of the 1st Tank Battalion were once again reunited. Late that year the battalion moved to New Guinea to begin preparations for the Cape Gloucester, New Britain operation. 1st Marine Division units including the 1st Tank Battalion made an amphibious assault on Cape Gloucester the day after Christmas 1943. Battalion tanks were immediately committed to the drive to expand the beachhead; but progress was impeded, not only by the resistance of the Japanese but also by the torrential rains and the rough terrain. For the rest of the month and in early January, the Marines made heavy contact with Japanese forces. Tanks of the 1st Tank Battalion during the Battle of Arawe Company B, which had been located on New Guinea, landed in the Arawe area of New Britain on 12 January 1944 to support Army forces there. Battalion units remained committed to the struggle for New Britain until Spring. By the beginning of May, however, all elements of the 1st Tank Battalion had been withdrawn from both New Britain and New Guinea and relocated to Pavavu Island in the Russell Islands. The assault and capture of Peleliu in the Palau Group was the next combat mission for the battalion. On 15 September 1944, it participated in the initial landing on the island. The 1st Tank Battalion, during this campaign rendered conspicuous service in defeating the enemy. Bitter fighting for the battalion continued for another two weeks. On 2 October 1944, it was withdrawn and redeployed to the Russells. The last campaign of the war for the 1st Tank Battalion was the assault on Okinawa. Beginning on 1 April 1945, the battalion was actively engaged in wresting control of the island fortress from the Japanese. The ferocity of the fighting during the battle is shown in the following losses of battalion tanks: 28 destroyed and 163 damaged. The cessation of hostilities was followed by the deployment of the battalion to North China in early October for occupation duty in Tientsin. In January 1947, the battalion minus Company B was relieved of its responsibilities in China and ordered to Guam. Another transfer occurred four months later. This time the unit with the exception of Company A was returned to the United States. The battalion arrived at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California on 1 May 1947, where it remained for the following three years. =Korean War= Shortly after the Communist invasion of South Korea in June 1950, the battalion was ordered to prepare to mount out for the Far East. The first element of the battalion arrived in the war zone on 2 August 1950. Upon arrival, it disembarked at the port of Pusan and immediately commenced operations against the enemy. The battalion, with Company A now reattached also participated in the amphibious landing at Inchon on 15 September. The 1st Tank Battalion remained locked in battle with both North Korea and Chinese Communist forces for three years. Redeployment back to the United States finally came in 1955. =Vietnam War= A 1st Tank Battalion tank using a flamethrower on a village in South Vietnam In March 1966 most of 1st Tank's M48A3 Patton tanksStarry p. 53 were deployed to the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). All of the battalion's components were reunited in Vietnam during May. Upon entry into the war-torn country, the battalion was ordered to support 1st Marine Division units operating in Military Region I (MR-I), also known as I Corps, in combat operations against the Viet Cong, and the North Vietnamese Army. The 1st Tank Battalion remained an active combat force in Vietnam until March 1970. The Battalion was redeployed to Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in early Spring 1970. =Gulf War and the 1990s= When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, 1st Tank Battalion deployed to Saudi Arabia's part of 1st Marine Expeditionary Force. On 7 September, the battalion was fully equipped with M60A1 Combat Tanks from Maritime Preposition Squadron 3 and was deployed from Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia as the armored backbone of the multinational force which was established during Operation Desert Shield in 1990. On 24 February 1991, less than a month into the Desert Storm phase of the campaign, the 1st Tank Battalion spearheaded the assault of Task Force Papa Bear into Kuwait. Company A was supporting Task Force Ripper. By 27 February, 1st Tank Battalion had reached the Kuwait International Airport and all Iraqi forces were destroyed. The cease-fire was established on 28 February and by April 1991, the battalion returned home to Las Flores, Camp Pendleton. On 2 June 1992 the colors of 1st Tank Battalion were transferred to Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms, California. =Iraq War= M1A1 outside of Fallujah on 9 May 2004 1st Tank Battalion participated in the 2003 invasion of Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom. They were present when Corporal Edward Chin of Bravo Company, (attached to 3rd Battalion 4th Marines) placed the American flag over Saddam's statue in Firdos Square before it was demolished. Since then, they have also participated in Operation Vigilant Resolve near and around the city of Fallujah. 1st Tank Battalion operated in support of Marine infantry for the duration of Operation Iraqi Freedom as armored support. Due to the continually shifting missions, members of the battalion also deployed as provisional infantry or provisional combat engineers. Currently 1st Tank Battalion is equipped with 58 M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks. =Afghanistan= On 1 January 2011 Company D, 1st Tank Battalion, deployed to Camp Leatherneck, Afghanistan and was the first American mechanized unit to employ the M1A1 Main Battle Tank in Helmand Province. These Tank Companies deployed in support of International Security Forces- Afghanistan. Company D deployed from Jan to Jul 2011, Company A deployed from Jan to Jul 2012, and Company D deployed from Jan to Jul 2013 as Tank Companies. In this time Company C deployed as a route clearance company (Oct 2011 to May 2012), Company B with elements from H&S; Company deployed as an advisory team (Jan 2012 to Jul 2012). =Notable former members= * G.

NYA float, \\"Projects for Out-of-School Youth\\", Inaugural Parade, Washington, D.C., January 20, 1937 The National Youth Administration (NYA) was a New Deal agency sponsored by the Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt in the United States that focused on providing work and education for Americans between the ages of 16 and 25. It operated from June 26, 1935 to 1939 as part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and included a Division of Negro Affairs headed by Mary McLeod Bethune who worked at the agency from 1936 to 1943. Following the passage of the Reorganization Act of 1939, the NYA was transferred from the WPA to the Federal Security Agency. In 1942, the NYA was transferred to the War Manpower Commission (WMC). The NYA was discontinued in 1943. By 1938, college youth were paid from $306 to $400 a month for \\"work study\\" projects at their schools. Another 155,000 boys and girls from relief families were paid $10 to $25 a month for part-time work that included job training. Unlike the Civilian Conservation Corps, it included young women. The youth normally lived at home, and worked on construction or repair projects. Its annual budget was approximately $580 million. The NYA was headed by Aubrey Willis Williams, a prominent liberal from Alabama who was close to Harry Hopkins and Eleanor Roosevelt. The head of the Texas division at one point was Lyndon B. Johnson, who was later to become president of the United States. The NYA operated several programs for out-of- school youth. Origins As the Great Depression continued to grip the American economy and inhibit the harnessing of American potential, unemployment and poverty spiraled to record highs. These debilitating years saw youth unemployment rise to 30% and the younger cohorts of the United States increasingly faced the devastation of not being able to afford education.David Woolner, \\"Saving a 'Lost Generation' Through the National Youth Administration\\" Roosevelt Institute (2011) Serving as the main catalyst for change and accelerator for government intervention, Eleanor Roosevelt advocated government involvement. In 1934 she notably declared that she frequently experienced \\"moments of real terror when [she thought] we might be losing this generation\\".Abramowitz, 570. Halfway through the depression, Roosevelt had mixed opinions on the NYA and started leaning towards Congress to shut it down. Creation In June 1935, to combat the economic forces that entangled youth and their families, the National Youth Administration was launched by Executive Order 7086. The federal agency was intended to assist young Americans during the tumultuous times, to prevent them from falling victim to current hardships, and to maintain their potential for future achievement and societal contribution. The NYA's first mission embodied the goal to prevent already-enrolled high school and university students from dropping out before earning their degree, out of necessity due to dire financial times. The agency achieved this by providing grants to youth in exchange for part-time work positions in various sectors of the education system, including administration, janitorial work, and cafeteria services. These efforts stemmed from a twofold mission to develop the youth's talent, while simultaneously keeping them from flooding the already-suffering and compromised labor markets.Woolner, \\"Saving a 'Lost Generation Through the National Youth Administration\\" Secondly, the NYA was committed to providing training and employment for long-term value and advancement. Young people were provided with work experience and learning-by-doing training in a wide variety of fields, including recreation, public service, education, the arts, research and development, agriculture, and construction.Cox, 127. By 1937, more than 400,000 youth were employed or participating in occupational training under the NYA. These vocational programs and occupational placements were put to the ultimate test with the onset of World War II. The 1939 outbreak of war in Europe provided the perfect testing grounds to observe the effectiveness of NYA's training and initiatives in many fields that were related to the war economy. The war effort increased the program's reach and saw a substantial surge in young, trained workers contributing to the defense industry. On a larger scale, the program enabled American youth to contribute to the war effort, stimulate the American war economy, and effectively turn the United States into an international powerhouse of production. Aubrey Williams The NYA was also fundamental in bringing considerations for African Americans into the dialogue surrounding aid to workers and maturing youth. This platform was strongly pushed by Aubrey Williams' leadership in the agency. He was a forerunner in addressing unemployment and access to education among African Americans, creating the Office of Minority Affairs. His goals emphasized increasing their economic well-being through labor opportunities, increased educational attainment, and maximizing potential. More generally, Williams was influential in emphasizing the program's broad reach and positive implications on the future. His public addresses adamantly expressed that the transition youth experienced when adjusting from elementary years to greater independence and work positions was always rough, yet the economic situation of the Depression aggravated the transition and threatened to derail reaching final aspirations of work. Consequentially, it was the NYA's duty to provide access to education, advancement, and sense of occupational achievement through its interactive initiatives and agendas.Williams, 66. Williams' emphasis on turning America's youth into productive citizens was further supported by President Franklin Roosevelt's proclamation that the \\"yield on this investment [the establishment of the NYA] should be high.\\" Williams, 377. Providing the youth with the foundation they needed would enable them to contribute to America's future development, the nation's strength, and progress and acceleration forward. Achievements and legacy NYA stone picnic table in Babcock Wayside on the Mississippi River in Minnesota Overall, the NYA helped over 4.5 million American youths find jobs, receive vocational training, and afford higher standards of education. More significantly, it provided the means necessary for this \\"struggling generation\\" to overcome the economic adversity that threatened to overrun the country. Through the NYA's initiatives, the youth triumphed and maintained their dignity by contributing to society, growing personally, and stimulating advancements in America that eventually proved crucial to pulling the country out of a period of domestic strife. As the home effort of World War II gained momentum, the NYA's crucial role quickly dwindled. The booming munitions and war industry economy was recruiting large numbers of workers, and the agency was no longer vital for ensuring work opportunity and growth among the population. This was specifically true for lesser-skilled workers who previously needed a support network to secure work or the skills needed to get their careers under way.Reiman, 175. The NYA had positive effects on the skilled labor supply, decreased the proportions of mismatched workers and employers, and improved America's capacity for production, growth, and economic stimulation. During other times of economic hardship, unemployment, and fears of declining education, activists have agitated for a similar program to be reestablished.

An anƒìr person is not merely non-Iranian, but specifically non-Zoroastrian; and anƒìr designates also worshipers of the dƒìws (\\"demons\\") or adherents of other religions.\\" In these texts of the ninth to twelfth century, \\"Arabs and Turks are called anƒìr, as are Muslims generally, the latter in a veiled manner.\\" In inscriptions In official usage, the term is first attested in inscriptions of Shapur I (r. 241‚Äì272), who styled himself the \\"king of kings of ƒírƒÅn and AnƒìrƒÅn.\\" Shapur's claim to AnƒìrƒÅn reflected the emperor's victories over Valerian and Philip, and staked a claim against the Roman Empire, the enemies of the Sassanid state. This is also reflected in Shapur I's inscription at the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, where the emperor includes Syria, Cappadocia, and Cilicia - all three previously captured from the Romans ‚Äî in his list of AnƒìrƒÅn territories. The proclamation as \\"king of kings of ƒírƒÅn and AnƒìrƒÅn\\" remained a stock epithet of subsequent Sassanid dynasts. Thirty years after Shapur, the Zoroastrian high-priest Kartir included the Caucasus and Armenia in his list of AnƒìrƒÅn territories. In this, Kartir's inscription (also at Ka'ba-ye Zartosht) contradicts Shapur's, which included the same two regions in his list of regions of ƒírƒÅn. In scripture and folklore In the ninth to twelfth century Zoroastrian texts, the legendary Turanian king and military commander Afrasiab is (together with Dahag and Alexander the Great) the most hated among the beings that Ahriman (Avestan Angra Mainyu) set against the Iranians (Zand-i Wahman yasn 7.32; Menog-i Khrad 8.29). In the Shahnameh, the poet Ferdowsi draws on Zoroastrian scripture (with due attribution) and retains the association of Aneran with the Turanians. The poet, however, specifically places them beyond the Amu Darya and identifies the Turanians as \\"Turks\\". From the point of view of Ferdowsi's home in Khorasan, this identification coincides with the Avestan notion (e.g. Vendidad 7.2, 19.1) that the lands of Angra Mainyu (Middle Persian: Ahriman) lay to the north. The two sources do however diverge with respect to details. In the Avesta, Sogdia (Avestan Sughdha, present-day Sughd and Samarqand Regions) is not AnƒìrƒÅn ‚Äì Sogdia is one of the sixteen lands created by Mazda, not one of the lands of Angra Mainyu. Nonetheless, for Ferdowsi the division between ƒírƒÅn and AnƒìrƒÅn is just as rigid as it is in the Avesta: When the primordial king Fereydun (Avestan Œòraƒìtaona) divides his kingdom ‚Äì the whole world ‚Äì among his three sons, he gives the Semitic lands in the west to the eldest, the lands of the north to his middle son Tur (Avestan Turya, hence the name \\"Turanian\\"), and ƒírƒÅn to his youngest (Shahnameh 1.189.). In the story, this partition leads to a family feud in which an alliance of the two elder sons (who rule over the AnƒìrƒÅnian lands) battle the forces of the youngest (the Iranians). The Iranians win. For Ferdowsi, the Turanians/AnƒìrƒÅnians (often used interchangeably) are unquestionably the villains of peace. Their conflict with Iranians is the main theme of the Shahnameh and accounts for more than half of the text. The deaths of heroes and other admirable figures are frequently attributed to Turanians. Thus Shahnameh 5.92. says a Turanian raider named Tur-Baratur killed the 77-year-old Zoroaster in Balkh.

R. Murugadoss. It stars Chiranjeevi and Trisha, while an ensemble cast including Prakash Raj, Sharada, Khushbu Sundar, Pradeep Rawat, and Brahmanandam in supporting roles. The film was screened at the International Film Festival of India in the mainstream section.Stalin Strikes Gold, 6 November 2013 The film was later dubbed in Hindi under the same name. The film was remade into Hindi titled, Jai Ho, directed by Sohail Khan, starring Salman Khan, Daisy Shah, and Tabu. The film released on 20 September 2006.This movie was based on Pay it forward(film)  Plot  The only mission in Stalin's (Chiranjeevi) life is to help others and make the world a better place. It turns out that he served as a Major in the Indian Army. Although a war hero, he quit the army after a rift with Lt. Col. Iqbal Kakar (Mukesh Rishi) when he transfers him to the administrative division from the battlefield as a disciplinary action. His family includes his mother (Sharada) and sister Jhansi (Khushbu Sundar), who is not in talking terms with their mother since she married a Punjabi. Stalin keeps helping a physically challenged girl named Sumati write her intermediate examination, and her suicide disturbs him. The death occurs as none of the people around her extend help. Stalin then plans a chain system. The theme works on a principle that everyone should help others, and in return, they should not seek a mere thanks but tell those who get the help to help three more, with a condition that those who get help from them should also demand the same. Stalin thinks that this chain will develop helping attitude among the people but unfortunately finds that the chain did not work. On one occasion, he bashes a rich boy who injured a beggar. This goes in a chain reaction, and the rich boy employs goons to attack Stalin. As Stalin disappears from the scene, the goons take Jhansi and her friend Chitra (Trisha) into their custody. Stalin reaches the spot and hacks the hand of one goon which happens to be the henchman of an MLA (Pradeep Rawat), who is the son-in-law of Home Minister Muddu Krishnayya (Prakash Raj). Krishnayya takes it as a prestige issue and tries to eliminate Stalin but loses his son (Riyaz Khan) in the process. When the Chief Minister intervenes to bring in a patch- up, Krishnayya plans to kill him and implicate Stalin in the murder. Stalin saves the injured Chief Minister but gets a severe chest pain due to exertion. The reason for the chest pain is a bullet which remained in his chest, very near to his heart. Stalin sustains the bullet injury in the Kargil War, and that was why Iqbal shifted him to the administrative department. Finally, the truth prevails, and the CM returns to the hospital to visit Stalin. The \\"help three people\\" concept was his brainchild, which saved him from death in the form of a schoolgirl. Finally, the doctors successfully remove the bullet in a very delicate surgery. Krishnayya also gets arrested. Stalin comes to know that his \\"help three people\\" concept worked well, and the same theme saved his life in the form of an auto driver. He thanks all the people for making his concept a success.

Life  Vagif was born in 1717 in the village of Salahly, but spent most part of his life in Karabakh. Soon after coming to Shusha, the capital of the Karabakh khanate at the time, Vagif became popular and beloved among the people due to his knowledge and talents. There was even a saying: \\"Not every literate person can be Vagif\\". Vagif's mausoleum in Shusha before the occupation of the town by Armenian forces As vizier, Vagif did much for the prosperity and political growth of the Karabakh khanate. Also, he played an important role in organizing the defence of Shusha during the incursions of Aga Muhammad shah Qajar of Persia in 1795 and 1797. =Siege of 1795= The historian Mirza Adigozal bey records the following possibly apocryphal tale: during the 1795 siege of Shusha, which resisted stubbornly despite the overwhelming numbers of Aga Muhammad's army, the shah had the following couplet by Urfi, the Persian-Indian poet, attached to an arrow and shot behind the walls of the city: The shah was playing on the meaning of Shusha: \\"glass\\" in Persian (and Azeri). When the message was delivered to Ibrahim-Khalil khan, the ruler of Shusha, he called upon Vagif, his vizier, who immediately wrote the following response on the reverse of the message: Receiving the letter with this poem, shah Aga-Muhhamed went into a rage and renewed the cannon attack on Shusha. However, after 33 days, the shah lifted the siege and headed to Georgia. =Conquest of Shusha and Death= Shah Qajar invaded Karabakh a second time in 1797, after the Russian armies that briefly occupied the Caucasus were withdrawn on the death of Catherine II. This time, Karabakh was undergoing a drought and was incapable of resisting. Ibrahim-Khalil khan escaped Shusha and the city fell quickly. Vagif was imprisoned and awaited death the following morning but was saved when the shah was assassinated that very night under mysterious circumstances. The reprieve did not last long. The nephew of Ibrahim-Khalil khan, Muhammed bey Javanshir, came to power after the now shah-less Persian army returned to Iran. Seeing in Vagif a loyal follower of his uncle, he had Vagif and his son executed. At the time of his death, his house was plundered and many of his verses were lost. Vagif's remains were kept in Shusha, where a mausoleum in his name was built during the Soviet era in the 1970s. This mausoleum was destroyed in 1992 during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. The fate of Vagif's remains is unknown.  Poetry  Despite the circumstances of his death, Vagif's poetry has persevered. His verses were collected for the first time in 1856 and published by Mirza Yousif Nersesov. Soon afterwards, his verses were published by Adolf Berge in Leipzig in 1867 with the assistance of M.F. Akhundov, a prominent 19th-century Azeri playwright. Vagif's works herald a new era in Azeri poetry, treating more mundane feelings and desires rather than the abstract and religious themes prevalent in the Sufi-leaning poetry of the time. This was the main characteristic that distinguished Vagif from his predecessors and made him the founder of the realism genre in Azeri poetry. The language of Vagif's poems was qualitatively innovative as well: vivid, simple, and closely approaching the Azeri vernacular. Vagif's poems have had a great influence on Azeri folklore and many of them are repeatedly used in the folk music of ashugs (wandering minstrels).

It also stars Fay Wray and ZaSu Pitts. Paramount Pictures forced von Stroheim to create two films from the footage, the second being The Honeymoon (eventually re-edited back into one film for a re-release). The Honeymoon is now considered lost, the only known copy destroyed in a fire in France in 1959.Progressive Silent Film List: The Wedding March at silentera.com In 2003, The Wedding March was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.\\" Plot In Vienna in 1914, Prince Nicki is the scion of a rundown noble family and is commander of a cavalry regiment. During a parade in front of the St. Stephen's Cathedral, Nicki notices beautiful innkeeper's daughter Mitzi in the crowd. Mitzi is eating with her family as her butcher fiance Schani grotesquely spits and embarrasses the entire family. Nicki and Mitzi flirt with each other during the parade. During a gun salute Nicki's horse becomes afraid and injures Mitzi, who is sent to the hospital. Nicki also has Schani arrested at this time. Nicki visits Mitzi at the hospital and later in the pub where she works as a harpist. They begin to go on dates and fall in love. Knowing of his family's financial troubles, Nicki is approached by a wealthy factory owner to marry his daughter Cecilia in exchange for a noble title. Nicki initially refuses but finally agrees to marry Cecilia. Schani is released from prison and finds out about the relationship between Mitzi and Nicki, and shows Mitzi a newspaper article announcing the marriage of Nicki and Cecilia. Mitzi remains calm and tells Schani that she hates him and still loves Nicki. Enraged Schani tries to rape Mitzi, but his father prevents it at the last moment. Schani decides to murder Nicki after the wedding. The marriage of Nicki and Cecilia is celebrated. Schani is waiting for Nicki with a gun at the church. At the last moment Mitzi appears and promises to marry Schani if he does not kill Nicki. Nicki and Cecilia get into their coach and drive away. =The Honeymoon= The Honeymoon depicts the honeymoon of Prince Nicki in the Alps, and the wedding of Mitzi and Schani. Mitzi still loves Nicki, and jealous Schani decides once again to kill the prince. Schani shoots at Nicki, but Cecilia throws herself in front of Nicki. Schani becomes a fugitive and goes into hiding. Nicki and Mitzi meet one last time, where Mitzi tells Nicki that she will go to a convent. Nicki goes off to war, where he is killed.

Stroheim‚Äôs script was completed by March 1926 and was 154 pages long. The currently available version of the film depicts the first 67 pages of the original script. As was often the case with films directed by Stroheim, the film's accuracy resulted in high expenses and production value. Stroheim rebuilt huge sets for St. Stephen's Cathedral, the streets surrounding it, various palatial rooms and an entire apple orchard with thousands of blossoms individually tied to the trees. Stroheim defended his elaborate set choices by stating ‚ÄúThey say I give them sewers ‚Äî and dead cats! This time I am giving them beauty. Beauty ‚Äî and apple blossoms! More than they can stand!‚Äù. =Filming= Shooting began in June 1926 and lasted until Stroheim was finally shut down by Powers in January 1927. A reporter allowed onto the film's set reported Stroheim's perfectionism and indifference to time and money, and stated that Stroheim once told his cast and crew that if necessary they would film 24,000 takes of a scene until they got it right. Over the six months of filming, Stroheim shot over 200,000 feet of film. The film's original budget was an estimated at $300,000 ($ today). By the time Pat Powers shut down production, the budget had risen to $1,250,000 ($ today). =Editing= In January 1927, Stroheim screened the footage for Powers and began to edit the film, wanting to release two separate films to be shown on consecutive nights. His initial cut of part 1 was 25,795 feet long (a little over four hours), after which he refused to cut the film further. Powers took control of the film. Powers had convinced Paramount Studios to distribute the film and, after not being sure how to release it after twelve months of editing, they finished a shorter cut of the entire two-part film in January 1928. Paramount hired film director Josef von Sternberg to re-edit the film to a more manageable length. Studio records show that Stroheim approved of Sternberg, but Stroheim later partially blamed Sternberg for the film's re- cutting. Stroheim's first cut of part two was 22,484 feet. He then cut it down to between 15,000 and 20,000 feet before the studio and Sternberg made their cut. Only 4,500 feet of Stroheim's original cut were used in the final film. In 1947, Stroheim claimed that he had finished editing the first part of the film, but never completed the second part after it was given to Sternberg. He also said that the film's final budget was $900,000 and that Powers and Paramount made a profit from the film, while he was denied his contractual 25% of the film's gross. This statement is untrue and the film's final budget, taking two years of interest, the film's color sequences, and creating sound disks for the release into account, was well over a million dollars. The Wedding March was previewed at the Egyptian Theater in Long Beach, California the following March. After the disastrous preview, Paramount decided to release The Wedding March as two films after all, with part two being re- titled The Honeymoon. The Wedding March was 14 reels long and The Honeymoon was eight reels long. The first three reels of The Honeymoon was footage from The Wedding March that was used as exposition. Only five reels of Stroheim's original footage of the second half of The Wedding March was used, which amounted to approximately 50 minutes and was only one fifth of Stroheim's original cut. Reception The Wedding March was released in October 1928, while The Honeymoon was only released in Europe and South America several months later. It was a box office failure and was released just as silent films were beginning to become unsuccessful after \\"talkies\\" had taken over the film market. Variety called it \\"a ponderous, slow moving production.\\" Hanns G. Lustig said that the film was \\"a colored fairy tale. But the colors are poisonous. Stroheim is a hard man. But his toughness shows the memory of the tender falsehood of dreams. And his melancholy revenge for their existence is brutal cartoons. A unique, exciting event.\\"Jacobsen, Belach. Erich von Stroheim. Aargon. 1994. . p. 284 Legacy In 1950, Henri Langlois of the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise gave Stroheim the opportunity to re-edit The Wedding March and The Honeymoon from prints that he owned. Stroheim added sound effects and put certain scenes back in his original order. The last known copy of The Honeymoon was destroyed in a fire at Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise on July 10, 1959. Langlois claimed that the film had \\"died voluntarily.\\" The reputation of The Wedding March began to grow after Stroheim's death. Langlois presented the film at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in 1965, calling it a film \\"like a torso without a head.\\" The film was screened at the 3rd New York Film Festival, where it was mostly received favorably. However, Bosley Crowther called it \\"disappointing\\". It was screened at the Lincoln Center again in 1970 and received a standing ovation. Paramount first released the film on VHS in 1987. However they replaced J. S. Zamecnik's full orchestral score with a new pipe organ score.

It is also sometimes known as Varbrul analysis, after the name of a software package dedicated to carrying out the relevant statistical computations (Varbrul, from \\"variable rule\\"). The method goes back to a theoretical approach developed by the sociolinguist William Labov in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and its mathematical implementation was developed by Henrietta Cedergren and David Sankoff in 1974.Cedergren, H.; and Sankoff, D. (1974). Variable rules: Performance as a statistical reflection of competence. Language, 50, 333-355. A variable rules analysis is designed to provide a quantitative model of a situation where speakers alternate between different forms that have the same meaning and stand in free variation, but in such a way that the probability of choice of either the one or the other form is conditioned by a variety of context factors or social characteristics. Such a situation, where variation is not entirely random but rule-governed, is also known as \\"structured variation\\". A variable rules analysis computes a multivariate statistical model, on the basis of observed token counts, such that each determining factor is assigned a numerical factor weight that describes how it influences the probabilities of choice of either form. This is done by means of stepwise logistic regression, using a maximum likelihood algorithm. Although the necessary computations required for a variable rules analysis can be carried out with the help of mainstream general-purpose statistics software packages such as SPSS, it is more often done by means of a specialised software dedicated to the needs of linguists, called Varbrul. It was originally written by David Sankoff and currently exists in freeware implementations for Mac OS and Microsoft Windows, under the title of Goldvarb X. There are also versions implemented in the statistical language R and therefore available on most platforms. These include R-Varb and Rbrul. Variable rules approaches are commonly employed for the analysis of data in sociolinguistic research, especially in studies that aim to investigate how reflexes of linguistic change through time appear in the shape of structured variation patterns within a speech community.Tagliamonte, S.

He became an Ottoman citizen in 1910 and was appointed as a school inspector and then as an instructor at Istanbul University (Dar√ºlf√ºnun). In 1912 he joined the Central Committee of the Committee for Union and Progress and was elected to the Ottoman Parliament as an MP for Karahisar. In the same years, along with other √©migr√©s from the Russian Empire, like the pan-Turkist writers Yusuf Ak√ßura and Ali bey Huseynzade, Aƒüaoƒülu became a key figure in the Turkish movement led by Ak√ßura's journal T√ºrk Yurdu (\\"Turkish Homeland\\") and became president of the T√ºrk Ocaƒüƒ± (\\"Turkish Hearth\\") movement. Upon the establishment of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ARD) in May 1918, Aƒüaoƒülu returned to Azerbaijan. He became an Azerbaijani citizen, was elected to Parliament (Milli Mejlis) and was chosen to represent the ADR at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. However, he was imprisoned by the British on Malta while on his way to the conference. He was set free only in 1921.Charles Kurzman: Modernist Islam, 1840-1940.

He was so successful in his work that on the 29 October 1921, he got appointed General Director of Press and Information by Atat√ºrk. From December on he was back in Ankara taking up his work which included the management of the Anadolu Ajansƒ±. Speaking in support of Westernization and secularization of Turkish society, he wrote in 1928: In 1923 he was elected MP and later was involved in the Constitutional Committee.In 1930 he founded the Free Republican Party, but as it became successful it was closed down in the same year, bringing an end to his political career. In 1933 he published the newspaper Akƒ±n. Due to the critical views towards In√∂n√ºs Government published in Akin, it was closed in fall 1933. Aƒüaoƒülu died in Istanbul in 1939. He was laid to rest at the Ferik√∂y Cemetery in Istanbul. He was married to Sitare Hanƒ±m, and had five children. Views Aƒüaoƒülu considered cultural and educational progress to be the major part for national liberation and viewed the emancipation of women as part of the struggle. Aƒüaoƒülu was the first member of the Azeri national intelligentsia to raise his voice for the equal rights for women. In his book Woman in the Islamic World, published in 1901, he claimed that \\"without women liberated, there can be no national progress\\".

As a strongman, he won the 1989 World's Strongest Man, was World Muscle Power champion, and also had numerous other titles including Europe's Strongest Man and Britain's Strongest Man. Following retirement from competitive sport he continued to be involved in strength athletics as a referee, event promoter and coach. Early life Reeves was born in 1962 in Sheffield, Yorkshire. He grew up in the city and went to the City School. At school he had been a swimmer at county level, a centre-forward for his football team and had also played as Number 8 in the rugby union side that won the under-15 Yorkshire Cup. He went on to become a colliery blacksmith's welder before his success as a strongman led him to give up that profession. Strongman When Reeves saw Bill Kazmaier win his third World's Strongest Man title in 1982, on BBC television, he decided that would be his aim, and took up weights. By 1986 he had become the Yorkshire and North East powerlifting champion in the superheavy class. In addition to powerlifting he had become actively involved in strength athletics and in 1986 won the National Truck Pulling Championships (sponsored by ASA/Bristol Street Motors) and came second to Peter Tregloan in 1986 in the Midland's Strongest Man competition. In 1987 he improved on his second-place finish by winning the Midland's Strongest Man (the first of three consecutive wins). That year he also won the first of three consecutive Yorkshire's Strongest Man competitions and won the England's Strongest Man competition also. In 1988 he took the title of East Britain's Strongest Man and entered John Smith's Trial of Strength, a competition organised by Geoff Capes and David Webster in order to find the successor to the retired Capes. He won the title, the equivalent that year of Britain's Strongest Man. Underlining his calibre, he then broke Tom Topham's 274-year-old record by harness lifting three beer barrels weighing a total of 845 kg. This performances culminated in an invitation to the 1988 World's Strongest Man where he finished third on his first attempt, to J√≥n P√°ll Sigmarsson and Bill Kazmaier. The following year he won the competition in San Sebasti√°n again excelling in gripping events, seen as his speciality. He was injured for the next two competitions and on his return in 1992 came second equal with Magn√∫s Ver Magn√∫sson. Domestically, he won the British Muscle Power Championships and Britain's Strongest Man on numerous occasions and in total was nine times England's Strongest Man. Powerlifting Jamie's best results in IPF or WPC powerlifting competition are: *Squat - (IPF) *Bench press - (done at WPC Push-Pull exhibition meet in 1994 in England) *Deadlift - (IPF) *All lifts performed \\"raw\\" (no power suits or bench shirts) Retirement After retiring from strength sports, Jamie became an International Federation of Strength Athletes judge, and ran his own gym.

Though she never received a formal degree in anthropology, she conducted extensive fieldwork among the !Kung San people of the Kalahari desert in south-western Africa and was widely known for her descriptions of the lives of women in this hunter-gatherer society. Life Shostak was raised in Brooklyn, New York. She received her B.A. in literature from Brooklyn College, where she was a supporter of the women's equal rights movement, and met her future husband, Melvin Konner. In 1969‚Äì71, Shostak and Konner lived among the !Kung San in the Dobe region of southwest Africa, on the border between Botswana and South Africa. There they learned the !Kung language and conducted anthropological fieldwork. While her husband looked at medical issues like nutrition and fertility, Shostak examined the role of women in the !Kung San society, becoming close with one woman in particular, known by the pseudonym \\"Nisa\\". Shostak's book on the subject, Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung Woman, was first published by Harvard University Press in 1981, and is now a standard work in anthropology. It weaves together the different voices of Shostak and Nisa, alternating between anthropological observation and the life story of a \\"primitive\\" woman told in her own words. In the book Shostak argues that !Kung San women had higher status and autonomy than women in Western cultures because of their food contributions. During the 1980s, Shostak and Konner also wrote a popular book and a number of articles advocating a \\"Paleolithic diet\\", which is based on the idea that many illnesses found in agricultural and industrialized societies result at least in part from diets that differ significantly from those that human beings evolved to eat. Shostak and Konner had three children together. In 1983 they moved to Atlanta, Georgia, when Konner was offered a position as chair of the department of anthropology at Emory University and Shostak became a research associate at the Institute of Liberal Arts.Miscellaneous Obituaries of Anthropologists She also taught courses in anthropology on life history methods and the Kalahari.

Located in the Cantabrian Mountains in northern Spain, the monastery is one of the five places in Christianity that, together with Rome, Jerusalem, Santiago de Compostela and Caravaca de la Cruz, has the privilege of issuing perpetual indulgences. The monastery was founded prior to the 6th century. According to tradition, the monastery venerates the largest piece of the Lignum Crucis discovered in Jerusalem by Saint Helena of Constantinople. Brought from the Church of the Holy Sepulcher by Saint Turibius of Astorga, the left arm of the True Cross is kept on a gilded silver reliquary. The monastery was initially dedicated to St. Martin of Tours but its name was changed in the 12th century. On April 16, 1961, the Franciscan friars, Custodians of the Holy Places, were entrusted with the relic's safekeeping and with the promotion of the devotion to the Holy Cross.  History  Its origins are obscure, but it was during the reign of Alfonso I of Asturias, who was repopulating the area around Li√©bana during the early part of the reconquest of Spain in the mid-8th century. The first reference to the monastery of Turieno with the protection of Saint Turibius was made in 1125. Its foundation is attributed to a 6th- century Bishop of Palencia called Turibius of Li√©bana, who retired with some companions to Li√©bana to live according to the Benedictine rule. When it was founded, the monastery was first dedicated to Saint Martin of Tours, which name over time was changed to Saint Turibius of Li√©bana. Probably during the 8th century, the body of another 6th-century bishop, Saint Turibius of Astorga was moved to the monastery, along with relics which he was believed to have brought from the Holy Land for safekeeping. The most important of these is that of the Wood of the True Cross (Lignum Crucis), believed by some Roman Catholics to be the biggest surviving piece of the cross upon which Jesus Christ was crucified. Because of this, the monastery was an important pilgrimage centre, and is one of the most important holy sites of Roman Catholicism in Europe, alongside other notable places such as Rome, Santiago de Compostela, Caravaca de la Cruz and Assisi. The monastery was also where the 8th century monk Beatus of Li√©bana wrote and illustrated his works, such as his Commentary on the Apocalypse. The monastery was originally a royal possession, but it was given by Alfonso VIII of Castile to Count G√≥mez y Countess Emilia, who then passed it on to the monastery of O√±a (Burgos), along with other properties in Li√©bana and neighbouring provinces. The monastic community ceased to exist after the forced sale of religious land in Spain in 1837, but was replaced in 1961 by a small community of Friars Minor.  Church  The most important building is the gothic church, whose construction began in 1256, though it has been remodeled several times since. It is built on the site of a pre-Romanesque and a Romanesque building (perhaps Asturian or Mozarabic in style). It has the clarity of line and space, and the surrounding decoration that characterises the architecture of San Bernardo. The church is rectangular in plan with three aisles; a tower at the foot of the central, widest aisle, and three polygonal apses. Its facade is similar to that of the Abbey of the Holy Bodies, the cathedral of Santander. Its doors in the southern wall are Romanesque in style and possibly predate the building inside. The principal door, the Puerta del Perd√≥n (Door of Forgiveness) is only ever opened during each Jubilee Year when Saint Turibius' day coincides with a Sunday. The cloister was completed in the 17th century.  The True Cross  The largest surviving piece of the True Cross. According to tradition, this relic is part of the True Cross that the Empress Saint Helena unearthed in Jerusalem. From there, Saint Turibius of Astorga, Custodian of the Holy Places, took it to the cathedral of his hometown in Astorga, Spain, where he was soon made bishop. When the Moors invaded Spain in 711, the relic was hidden along with others in a fold on Mount Viorna in the Liebana Valley, next to St. Turibius' relics. Both relics were eventually transferred to the monastery that immediately became an important place to be visited by pilgrims on their way to Santiago de Compostela. Documents dated 1507 state that, \\"since time immemorial\\" the Jubilee is celebrated every time the saint's feast-day falls on a Sunday. Fr. Sandoval, chronicler of the Benedictine order, wrote that this relic is the \\"left arm of the Holy Cross. It was sawed and assembled in the form of a cross, leaving intact the hole where was nailed down the hand of Christ\\". The vertical bar is long and the crossbar is long. The cross has a thickness of . It is the largest preserved relic of the True Cross. The wood was embedded in a Gothic silver gilt cross, manufactured by a workshop of Valladolid in 1679. It lies in a housing of golden wood in a baroque, domed, early 18th-century chapel in the north wall of the church, looked over by an effigy of the chapel's founder, Francisco de Cos√≠o y Otero (1640‚Äì1715), Grand Inquisitor of Madrid and later Archbishop of Bogot√° in Colombia, who was born locally. In 1817 Ignacio Ram√≥n de Roda, Bishop of Le√≥n, went to the monastery and asked permission of the prior of the Benedictine monks to remove a portion of the Cross. Two pieces of wood arranged in the form of a cross in a reliquary were given to Don Joachim and Don Felix Columbus, descendants of Christopher Columbus, for the chapel of their family castle in Asturias. In 1909 Terry and Mathilde Boal inherited and imported to their American estate the chapel of the Columbus family, including an admiral's desk that belonged to the famous explorer himself. They brought from Spain to Boalsburg, Pennsylvania, the entrance door and the whole interior of the Columbus Chapel with the relic of the True Cross. In 1958 a scientific investigation carried out by Madrid's Forestry Research Institute concluded that the relic is of a Mediterranean Cypress wood (Cupressus sempervirens), very common in Israel, and could be older than 2,000 years.

In Modern Standard Arabic and many dialects, it represents an \\"emphatic\\" , and it might be pronounced as a pharyngealized voiced alveolar stop , pharyngealized voiced dental stop or velarized voiced dental stop . The sound it represented at the time of the introduction of the Arabic alphabet is somewhat uncertain, likely a pharyngealized voiced alveolar lateral fricative or a similar affricated sound or . One of the important aspects in some Tihama dialects is the preservation of the emphatic lateral fricative sound , this sound is likely to be very similar to the original realization of ·∏çƒÅd, but this sound () and are used as two allophones for the two sounds ·∏çƒÅd and ·∏è·∫°ÃÑ æ . Origin Based on ancient descriptions of this sound, it is clear that in Qur'anic Arabic ·∏ç was some sort of unusual lateral sound. Sibawayh, author of the first book on Arabic grammar, explained the letter as being articulated from \\"between the first part of the side of the tongue and the adjoining molars\\". It is reconstructed by modern linguists as having been either a pharyngealized voiced alveolar lateral fricative or a similar affricated sound or . The affricated form is suggested by loans of ·∏ç into Akkadian as ld or l·π≠ and into Malaysian as dl. However, not all linguists agree on this; the French orientalist Andr√© Roman supposes that the letter was actually a voiced emphatic alveolo-palatal sibilant , similar to the Polish ≈∫. This is an extremely unusual sound, and led the early Arabic grammarians to describe Arabic as the lughat a·∏ç-·∏çƒÅd \\"the language of the ·∏çƒÅd\\", since the sound was thought to be unique to Arabic. The emphatic lateral nature of this sound is possibly inherited from Proto-Semitic, and is compared to a phoneme in South Semitic languages such as Mehri (where it is usually an ejective lateral fricative). The corresponding letter in the South Arabian alphabet is ·∏ç , and in Ge'ez alphabet ' ·çÄ), although in Ge'ez it merged early on with . The reconstruction of Proto-Semitic phonology includes an emphatic voiceless alveolar lateral fricative or affricate for '. This sound is considered to be the direct ancestor of Arabic ', while merging with in most other Semitic languages. The letter itself is distinguished a derivation, by addition of a diacritic dot, from ÿµ ·π£ƒÅd (representing /sÀ§/). Pronunciation 500x500px The standard pronunciation of this letter in modern Standard Arabic is the \\"emphatic\\" : pharyngealized voiced alveolar stop , pharyngealized voiced dental stop or velarized voiced dental stop . In most Bedouin influenced Arabic vernaculars ·∏çƒÅd and ·∫ìƒÅ æ have been merged quite early like in the varieties (such as Bedouin and Iraqi), where the dental fricatives are preserved, both the letters are pronounced . However, there are dialects in South Arabia and in Mauritania where both the letters are kept different but not in all contexts. In other vernaculars such as Egyptian the distinction between ·∏çƒÅd and ·∫ìƒÅ æ is most of the time made; but Classical Arabic ·∫ìƒÅ æ often becomes , e.g.  øa·∫ìƒ´m (< Classical  øa·∏èÃ£ƒ´m) \\"great\\". \\"De-emphaticized\\" pronunciation of the both letters in the form of the plain entered into other non-Arabic languages such as Persian, Urdu, Turkish. However, there do exist Arabic borrowings into Ibero-Romance languages as well as Hausa and Malay, where ·∏çƒÅd and ·∫ìƒÅ æ are differentiated. Transliteration is transliterated as ·∏ç (D with underdot) in romanization. The combination ‚ü®dh‚ü© is also sometimes used colloquially.

Throughout the course of his career, he played for the Houston Oilers (1985‚Äì1987), the Cleveland Browns (1987‚Äì1988), the Cincinnati Bengals (1988‚Äì1998), the New England Patriots (1999‚Äì2001), the Minnesota Vikings (2001), and the Philadelphia Eagles (2002). Before his NFL career, Johnson played college football for Brigham Young University. Early years Johnson was born in Conroe, Texas and was a punter and kicker for McCullough High School in The Woodlands, Texas. College career Johnson was a punter for Brigham Young University and was a member of the 1984 National Champion team. He was nicknamed \\"Thunderfoot\\" while at BYU. Johnson was an All-American selection in 1984. Professional career After graduating college, Johnson was selected by the Houston Oilers in the fifth round of the 1985 NFL Draft. In his 18 seasons, Johnson played in 259 games and recorded 1,226 punts for 51,979 yards and 317 punts in the 20, with 142 touchbacks. His 70-yard punt in 1990 was the longest of the season, and he led the NFL with a 38.5 net yard average in 1995. At the time of his retirement, his 51,979 punting yards were the third most in NFL history behind Sean Landeta and Jeff Feagles. Johnson's most successful years in the NFL were with the Bengals, where he spent 11 of his 18 seasons and made an NFL championship appearance in Super Bowl XXIII. In that game, Johnson set a record for the longest punt in Super Bowl history (63 yards). By 1998, Johnson had become extremely frustrated with Cincinnati, which had not recorded a winning season since 1990. After a 33-20 loss at home during the 1998 season, Johnson publicly denounced the Bengals management and said if he was a Cincinnati fan with season tickets, he would probably sell them. Johnson was cut by the Bengals the following day, and subsequently signed with the Patriots in the following season. He left the Bengals as their all-time leading punter with 746 punts for 32,196 yards and 186 punts in the 20. Johnson was the Patriots punter for the next two years, but was cut by the team five games into the 2001 season. He spent the rest of the year with the Vikings and played his final season with the Eagles before retiring from the NFL at age 40. Further reading *Ludwig, Chick. Cincinnati Bengals, The Legends.

The first two years of the school's MBChB course are taught mainly on Keele University campus although early exposure to patients is of importance and in the second year there is considerable interaction in a clinical setting. Years three to five, however, are principally taught within the Royal Stoke University Hospital in Stoke-on- Trent and the County Hospital (both part of University Hospitals North Midlands Trust), at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital, Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, North Staffordshire Combined Healthcare NHS Trust and South Staffordshire and Shropshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. Medical students also have placements in general practices in Staffordshire and Shropshire. The school originally accepted about 120 UK/EU and 10 non-EU medical students each year for the 5-year MBChB course and 10 UK/EU/non-EU students for the 6-year course. From 2011 the total accepted increased to about 150 from all sources. This number may vary depending on NHS requirements and funding. Within the United Kingdom the medical school is ranked third by The Guardian and The Sunday Times .https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng- interactive/2019/jun/07/university-league-tables-2020 Globally, the School of Medicine at Keele is ranked at 401-450 by the QS World University Rankings.https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university- subject-rankings/2019/medicine History =Establishment= 300x300px The Royal Commission on Medical Education (1965‚Äì68) issued its report (popularly known as the Todd Report) in 1968 on the state of medical education in the United Kingdom. The commission estimated that by 1994 there would be a need to train more than 4,500 doctors a year for the United Kingdom, and that this would have to be achieved by both increasing the numbers of medical students at existing medical schools, and establishing a number of new ones. It recommended that new medical schools should be immediately established at the universities of Nottingham, Southampton and Leicester. The Royal Commission considered the possibility of medical schools being established at Keele University, Hull University, Warwick University and Swansea University (then University College, Swansea). North Staffordshire was deemed a very good site as it had a growing local population and several large hospitals. However, 150 students a year would be required to make it economically and educationally viable and thus the scheme was postponed. In 1978, the Keele Department of Postgraduate Medicine opened. This department conducted medical research, and played a part in postgraduate medical education, but did not teach undergraduate medical students. In 2003, 35 years after the publication of the Todd Report, the current medical school was founded. =Initial teaching= From 2002 the school began teaching clinical undergraduate medicine to clinical medical students who had completed their pre-clinical medical education at either School of Medicine, University of Manchester or the Bute Medical School (University of St Andrews). These students followed the curriculum of the Manchester School of Medicine clinical course, and after three years of clinical study at Keele, were awarded the degrees of MBChB by the University of Manchester. The first cohort of students completing their course at Keele did so in 2005. In 2003, Keele started teaching the full five- year course, using the Manchester curriculum. Both pre-clinical and clinical medical education were established in Staffordshire and Shropshire. Keele began to develop its own undergraduate medical curriculum in 2007. =Current teaching= left From the 2011/12 academic year all students have followed the Keele curriculum. In January 2012 it was announced that the General Medical Council (GMC) had approved and registered the new five-year undergraduate curriculum. Students graduating in 2012 were awarded the Keele MBChB, wearing a new Keele two-colour hood reflecting the fact that students gain two degrees Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery. Previously medical students at Keele have graduated with a Manchester degree. The GMC visited and scrutinised progress throughout the course‚Äôs development. Keele's curriculum is integrated, with clinical experience and skills being taught in years one and two, and weekly science teaching in year three. A small number of graduate entry places are available for year two of the course and there is a six-year option for applicants with non-science qualifications. From 2006, applicants have been required to sit the UKCAT admission test. Years 1 and 2 teaching takes place on Keele University campus. Clinical teaching, years 3‚Äì5, takes place at the Royal Stoke University Hospital site, in Hartshill. Teaching at Keele also involves attachments at District General hospitals in Stafford, Shrewsbury and Telford, as well as attachments to General Practitioners (GP) in Staffordshire and Shropshire. =Online learning= Keele Medical School promotes the use of online learning material, such as Keele Basic Bites, which is a free online video-based learning tool for Keele University Medical students, created by senior academic staff, providing medical education in an entertaining, as well as an informative fashion.

School of Nursing and Midwifery  The School of Nursing & Midwifery is located in the Clinical Education Centre (CEC) at the Royal Stoke University Hospital, together with the Health Library, and part of the School of Medicine. At undergraduate level, there is possibility to specialize in Adult Nursing, Children's Nursing, Learning Disability Nursing, Mental Health Nursing and Midwifery. Keele Medical Society Keele medical students formed the Keele Medical Society (KMS) in 2005. The organisation aims to represent students and promote social inclusion. Current developments In August 2013 a ¬£2.8m state-of-the-art Anatomy Skills Facility was completed with the school joining a select group of institutions offering leading edge facilities to attract surgeons from across the UK. It will also provide improved facilities for students and also offer senior surgeons the chance to improve high level skills. A ¬£2.2m extension to the medical school to accommodate the Research Institute for Primary Care Health Sciences (iPCHS) is scheduled for completion in November 2016 An additional ¬£21m medical research facility (including new laboratories) originally scheduled for completion in Stoke-on-Trent will be constructed on the Keele campus instead. Rankings = Medicine = Keele has rapidly established a prestigious reputation for medicine. The school was ranked 4 out of the UK's 33 medical schools in The Sunday Times Good University Guide 2017 with a student satisfaction score of 92.4%. Within the United Kingdom the medical school is ranked second only to Oxford and ahead of Cambridge by The Guardian and The Sunday Times . Globally, the School of Medicine at Keele is ranked 9th by the QS World University Rankings (51‚Äì100), placing higher than several American Ivy League universities, including Cornell, Brown and Penn. Keele was also highly regarded by students, rated in the top 3 medical institutions in the 2014, 2015 and 2016 National Student Surveys. The small intake has largely contributed to instill an esprit de corps amongst the student population. For 2017 non-graduate entry, the A'level requirement is A*AA at a single sitting including Biology or Chemistry, a second science chosen from either Mathematics, Physics, Biology and Chemistry and a third subject. In 2015, for the traditional 5-year MBChB course, 2202 applications were made by UK/EU students with 285 offers for 119 places. = Nursing and Midwifery = Similarly, in Nursing and Midwifery, Keele has performed particularly well. In 2017, Keele was ranked 4 out of the UK's 69 schools according to The Guardian with a 98% satisfaction rate amongst its student cohort. For 2017, the A'level requirements is BBC with all candidates for preregistration Nursing and Midwifery programmes are required to meet or exceed NMC requirements, including literacy and numeracy skills.

Accessed 8 January 2006.'Miracle baby' is feted in India at BBC News. Accessed 10 April 2008.  Development  Although classically considered conjoined twinning (which it resembles), diprosopus is not normally due to the fusion or incomplete separation of two embryos. It is the result of abnormal activity by the protein SHH (sonic hedgehog). (The name of this protein was inspired by the Sonic the Hedgehog video game character and is part of an idiosyncratic naming tradition in molecular biology research.) SHH and its corresponding gene have been found to play an important role in signaling craniofacial patterning during embryonic development. Among other things, SHH governs the width of facial features. In excess it leads to widening of facial features and to duplication of facial structures. The greater the widening, the more structures are duplicated, often in a mirror image form. This has been demonstrated in the laboratory by introducing pellets of the SHH protein into chicken embryos, resulting in chickens with duplicate beaks. Inadequate amounts of that protein lead to opposite conditions such as cyclopia where facial features are insufficiently developed. Healthy brain development is also dependent on the signaling function of SHH.Sonic Hedgehog shapes the brain. ScienceDaily, 13 March 2001. During embryonic development, SHH directs embryonic cells to organize in specific areas that later become specialized neural tissues, thus controlling the size and shape of brain structures.  Occurrences  Diprosopus often occurs in combination with other congenital disorders, particularly anencephaly, neural tube defect and cardiac malformations. When present, the brain may show abnormalities ranging from partial to complete duplication of brain structures, and/or underdevelopment of brain tissues. =Humans= Most human infants with diprosopus are stillborn. Known instances of humans with diprosopus surviving for longer than minutes to hours past birth are very rare; only a few are recorded. In 2002 and 2003, two living male infants with partial diprosopus were described in the medical literature in separate case reports. One infant was born with duplication of the nose and the cerebral frontal lobes, two widely spaced eyes, a small, underdeveloped central eye socket, and a large, asymmetric mouth. The other infant was born with duplication of the upper and lower jaw, two tongues arising from the same base, cleft palate, a slightly divided tip of the nose, and two widely spaced eyes, as well as absence of the corpus callosum, duplication of the pituitary gland and stalk, and abnormalities in the midbrain. Because they were born with a milder, partial form of diprosopus, both infants were considered candidates for surgical correction of their abnormal facial features.  Lali Singh  Lali Singh (10 March ‚Äì 10 May 2008) was born to Sushma and Vinod Singh in Saini, Sunpura Sohanpur village, near Delhi; the birth was delayed by dystocia caused by her large head, and her birth in a hospital was facilitated by her mother's receiving an episiotomy. She was one of the very few infants with diprosopus to survive well past birth. She might have been the only known living individual with complete facial duplication. Her facial features included two pairs of eyes, two noses, and two mouths (but only one pair of ears). She was seen as the reincarnation of the goddess Durga, who is sometimes depicted with many limbs and eyes. Sushma and Vinod Singh declined an offer from local doctors to evaluate their daughter through CT or MRI scanning. Without diagnostic imaging, it was not possible to know the full extent to which the child's condition might have affected her brain and other vital structures in her head and neck. Thus, any estimation of her ability to thrive or even survive could be only speculative, though Lali's family described her as functioning normally. It is also unknown whether neurosurgeons or craniofacial surgeons, if consulted, would have had feasible solutions to offer with respect to corrective surgery. A local doctor told reporters that the baby should be considered a healthy child who currently was living a normal life, a previously unknown occurrence among sufferers of the disorder.Two-Faced Baby Triggers Shock and Awe ABC report. Accessed 21 April 2008. Lali's two middle eyes suffered from corneal opacity due to abnormal anatomy of the facial muscles, which prevented her from properly closing those eyes. (Initially, this was wrongly blamed on camera flashes.) A cleft palate caused difficulty in her feeding under village conditions. A poor diet of bottle-fed sugar solution and diluted milk, allowed to drip down her throat, as she could not suck properly due to her cleft palate, weakened her condition, and vomiting and infection started. Admission to hospital was delayed by discussion (including taking her back home from hospital) among her extended family and her village's headman. Finally, her parents, alarmed at her illness and dehydration, defied her other relatives and took her back to hospital, where under proper medical treatment including antibiotic and a saline drip she started to improve, stopped vomiting, started drinking milk and defecating normally; but six hours later, at two months old to the day, she died of a heart attack.Channel 4 UK television program Body Shock, 10 pm to 11.10 pm Tuesday 16 September 2008 She was buried in her village, as is usual in Hinduism with children who die very young. Later a temple was built at the village in her memory.  Faith and Hope Howie  Faith Daisy and Hope Alice Howie (8 May ‚Äì 27 May 2014) were born in Sydney, Australia, to parents Simon Howie and Renee Young. Faith and Hope shared one body and skull, but had complete duplication of the facial features, as well as duplication of the brain; both brains joined to one brain stem. Young and Howie had learned at nineteen weeks gestation of their children's condition, but opted not to terminate the pregnancy. The children were born six weeks prematurely and appeared to be doing well, able to breathe unaided several days after their birth, and they were observed to sleep and cry at different times. They died nineteen days following their birth due to unknown causes, although some sources indicated that the girls died following an operation for unknown reasons. =Other animals= Janus, a goat with two faces on one body, survived from April 5 to May 5, 2020 in Wittenberg, Wisconsin.Melissa Siegler, Wausau Daily Herald (May 5, 2020) 'He will surely be missed': Two-headed goat born on Wittenberg farm dies Few two-faced animals have survived due to associated internal organ abnormalities and brain abnormalities. One of the most famous was Ditto, a pig. Ditto was raised to adulthood, but died of pneumonia caused by food inhalation when breathing through one muzzle while eating with the other. Cats with the condition are known as 'Janus cats', after the Roman god. In July 2006, a six-year-old male Janus cat called \\"Frank and Louie\\" from Millbury, Massachusetts, USA, received publicity. In their case, only one esophagus (and possibly only one trachea) were functional; this aided survival. In September 2011, when Frank and Louie were twelve years old, it was announced that they would appear in the 2012 Guinness Book of World Records as the longest-surviving Janus cat on record. In 2014, Frank and Louie died at the age of fifteen.

Around 160 AD, a military camp that was most likely founded on the remains of an older Thracian settlement acquired city rights under the name of Civitas Montanensium. The Roman Cult of Mithras: The God and His Mysteries (2001) p.129 The town developed and urbanized after a Roman model and became the second most important settlement in the province after Raciaria (near modern-day Archar). A fortress was built atop the hill overlooking Montana, as well as public and residential buildings, temples, baths and theatres. Montana became a typical imperial settlement, where the local romanized population coexisted alongside Italic and Anatolian settlers. The base of the town's economy was the big landowners of Italic origin and their villas and mansions, while the locals served to work in agricultural production and gold mining in the Ogosta river valley. A community of Greek settlers engaged in craftsmanship and money-lending lived in the town during the period. The patrons of Montana, in the spirit of Hellenism, were Diana and Apollo. = Middle Ages = Between 440 and 490, the northwest of modern Bulgaria was devastated by the raids of the Huns, under Attila, and later by the Goths. Slavs and Avars delivered the final blow to Greco-Roman culture in the region. The Slavs who settled later in the area called the town Kutlovitsa. During the time of the First and Second Bulgarian Empires, the settlement recovered and became the centre of an eparchy. = Ottoman rule = After Kutlovitsa was seized by the Ottomans, the settlement was destroyed and became deserted. It was renamed \\"Kutlof√ßa\\" by the Ottomans, which was derived from Kutlovitsa. Between 1450 and 1688, the town was resettled by Turks because of its strategic location, and went through another period of blossoming as a typically Oriental town. A mosque, fountains, and other new buildings were erected. There was also a Roman Bath left over the Middle Ages. = Modern history = After the Liberation began a massive wave of migration towards Kutlovitsa and a period of economic blossoming. An electricity station, a railway station, a post office and a hospital were built, a fair and a community centre emerged.

Awards He received the Des Lee Visiting Lectureship in Global Awareness at Webster University. Upon winning the Des Lee Visiting Lectureship in Global Awareness Suransky stated, \\"When I first saw the words ‚Äòglobal awareness‚Äô in the title of the award, I immediately thought ‚Äòthat‚Äôs not enough.‚Äô After finding out about a problem intellectually, how does one get to feel something about it? That involves empathy and compassion. This could involve taking some personal risk, perhaps even exposing oneself to some danger. So, in a nutshell, how do we move from understanding (becoming globally aware,) to compassion for others in our global village, to action to transform the often inequitable realities of a dramatically skewed world.\\"  Lectures given  *\\"The Global Economy and the Subversion of Indigenous Local Cultures\\" - Given at the 22nd annual Scientific Meeting of the International Society of Political Psychology in July 1999. *\\"Globalization: Scourge of the South\\", Given at the 21st annual Scientific Meeting of the International Society of Political Psychology in July 1998, as part of the 2nd panel on Globalization and Gender Identities.

It is at the foot of the highest mountain in the Balkan Peninsula ‚Äì the Rila Mountain, and about 50 km south of the capital Sofia. Dupnitsa is the second largest town in Kyustendil Province. History View of the clock tower in Dupnitsa, built in the 17th century The town has existed since antiquity. The German traveller Arnold von Harff visited Dupnitsa in 1499 and described it as a \\"beautiful town\\". The names Tobinitsa, Doupla and Dubnitsa are mentioned throughout history, the last one used until the Liberation of Bulgaria, when the official name was changed to Dupnitsa. In 1948 the town was renamed Stanke Dimitrov; for a short period in 1949 it was called Marek; the name was changed to Stanke Dimitrov in 1950. After the democratic changes, the old name Dupnitsa was restored. On 15 October 1902, around 600 women and children fled to the vicinity of Dupnitsa from Macedonia from the attacking Turkish troops. On a hill overlooking the town there is a giant cross, commemorating the Bulgarians who perished in the Balkan wars and World War I. On the same hill there lay the ruins of a medieval fortress. During World War II over 4,000 Jews from parts of Greece and Yugoslavia annexed by Bulgaria were arrested on 4 March 1943 and deported, some to an internment camp in Dupnitsa. Many of them were from Komotini and Xanthi. After 11-12 days in the Dupnitsa camp, on 18 ‚Äì 19 March they were transferred by train to Lom on the Danube for extermination at Treblinka. As part of the Bulgarian Commissariat for Jewish Affairs's policy of deporting Jews, Dupnitsa also was between June 1943 and September 1944 the site of a ghetto for 1,624 Jews expelled from Sofia, even though there was ultimately no exterminations of Jews resident within Bulgaria's pre-war borders. Nowadays Dupnitsa is a fast-developing town combining new buildings with modern architecture with its historical monuments. Because of its beautiful location at the foot of the Rila mountain, the town is marvelous holiday destination. One of the main branches of industry is the pharmaceutical company Actavis (formerly HeFeKa, in Bulgarian –•–§–ö), which gives employment to about 30 to 40 percent of the citizens. Small business is developing rapidly due to the town's economic growth. Dupnitsa is famous for its cultural festivals. From 1 May to 2 June many festivals are held in the town due to the richness of the Bulgarian holiday calendar. The nightlife is very well developed. There are a lot of local pubs and clubs where young people meet and have fun. A few other popular places for socializing are the recently refurbished Town Park and the Town Garden (–ì—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–∞ –≥—Ä–∞–¥–∏–Ω–∞, Gradska gradina). In recent years the town has become notorious due to the activities of an organised crime group led by pair of Bulgarian gangsters, former policemen Angel Hristov and Plamen Galev, known as the \\"Galevi brothers\\". Using intimidation and extortion, and with the help of corrupt policemen, they controlled Dupnitsa to the extent that they have been described as \\"the owners of the first private town in Bulgaria\\". Hristov and Galev are fugitives after having been sentenced to five and four years respectively but are still believed to control the town.

The team played with success in Europe, defeating at home powerhouses such as Bayern Munich, Aberdeen and Ferenzvaros. The Volleyball club Marek Union - Ivkoni is from the town. Dupnitsa also has strong traditions in chess, kick-boxing, baseball. Name The names Tobinitsa, Doupla and Dubnitsa are used throughout its history. Dubnitsa survived until the Liberation of Bulgaria, when the official name was changed to Dupnitsa. In 1948 the town was renamed Stanke Dimitrov; in 1949 it was called Marek; the name was once again changed to Stanke Dimitrov in 1950. After the democratic changes, the name Dupnitsa was restored. Dupnitsa is located at an altitude of 500 m in a valley, surrounded by hills. Its location, as seen from above, resembles a hole (–¥—É–ø–∫–∞, dupka in Bulgarian), hence the name Dupnitsa. There are five rivers flowing in the vicinity. Dupnitsa is referred to as \\"The Green and Shady Town\\", because of its location which makes it quite shady in summer and due to the abundance of trees in the town. Dupnitsa is called \\"The Little Italy of Bulgaria\\". This nickname comes from the fact that many inhabitants have gone over the years to work and live in Italy and every summer they return to their home town (see: Bulgarians in Italy). Another nickname of the town is \\"the town of pharmacy\\". Sister cities * Bryansk, Russia Honour Dupnitsa Point on Smith Island, South Shetland Islands is named after Dupnitsa.

Career  Grebanier was a professor of English at Brooklyn College from 1926 until 1964. In 1941 he was quoted in evidence presented to the Supreme Court of the United States denouncing a former associate professor as a Communist during the professor's appeal against dismissal from his position.Supreme Court Collection Slochower v.

Grebanier was friendly with other drama critics in the greater New York City but perhaps none was a better friend than New York Evening Post editor and chief drama critic Joseph Cookman. When Cookman died in 1944, the Post selected Grebanier's tribute to run in the paper among the dozens of tributes sent in.New York Post August 26th, 1944. Grebanier was Brooklyn College's most popular professor between the end of World War II and his retirement in 1965. His Shakespeare classes enrolled hundreds of students every semester. His method of teaching involved a line-by-line reading of Shakespeare's plays, interspersed with commentary on art, politics, and human psychology. Most influential of his books are \\"The Heart of Hamlet,\\" \\"The Truth About Shylock,\\" and \\"Playwriting\\": In these he 1) characterizes Hamlet as misunderstood by critics, as the hero is neither passive, delaying, crazy, or acting crazy, but rather a Renaissance man who tackles the difficult task of proving Claudius guilty and then proceeds to exact revenge; 2) maintains that Shakespeare does not pursue the question of anti-Semitism in \\"The Merchant of Venice\\" but rather uses the stereotype of the Jewish moneylender to ask critical questions about cold-hearted bankers and human compassion; 3) establishes fundamental concepts in the structure of drama that still prevail in creative writing courses across the country.

With the establishment of the Republic of Albania in 1912, a large influx of Albanians, as well as other Muslims, from Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Greece, Egypt,Bulgaria and Serbia continued to arrive in the region, most of which settled in north and central Albania. Today, between a third and a quarter of Albania's and Kosovo's population have ancestry from these Muhaxhirs. History The displacement of Albanians began earlier in northern Albania. The first known deportations date back to the 1877s. At this time, Albanians living in the northernmost parts of the New Bazaar, Kurshumlija and also the Nis vilayet were deported. At this time all those who could not escape were killed, massacred by various Serbian-Montenegrin forces. Thus, a profound change has been made to the demographic map of the region. Albanians were either expelled, fled and/or retreated from the captured areas seeking refuge in Ottoman Kosovo. para. 29. \\"The Albanian refugees (Turk. muchageers)\\" During the Balkan Wars, Muslim Albanians were deported from Christian territories, and settled in the Ottoman Empire, as far as the Middle East. Serbia Albanians until the second half of the 19th century lived also in the cities, towns and villages of the Sanjak of Ni≈°. The majority of Albanians were concentrated in the District of Toplica, which included the regions of Jablanica, Kosanica, Prokupje and the town of Prokuplje, the District of Nis, which included the regions of Vlasotinca, Leskovac, Nis and the city of Nis, the District of Vranje with regions of Masurica, Polanica, Pcinj and the city of Vranje and Pirot District (Nisava). Albanian residents were also in other places, especially in cities, like Qupri, Paracin, Uzice, Krushec, Aleksinc, Karanovc (Kraljevo) and even in Belgrade. In the Serbia lived about 250,000 Albanian and other Muslims (Circassians,Bosniaks and Turks). Ilia Gracanin createt a platform and a program for the expulsion of the Albanians and Muslims from Serbia. After 16 December 1877, the Serbian army started the a campaign in the Balkans area against the defenseless Albanian population of Sanjak of Nis. The Serbian army attacked the civilian population, killing and massacring elders, women, children and others. They set fire to Albanian and Muslim settlements, burned houses and other objects of the Albanian owners. Serbian prince Milan I of Serbia, in order to achieve this goal, had distributed to his Serbian soldiers a proclamation saying: \\"... the fewer Albanians left in the territories liberated from Turkey, the more you contribute to the state. The more displaced Albanians, the greater merits for your country. \\" Serbian writer Jovan Had≈æi-Vasiljeviƒá explains the Serbian government's intentions of invading territories in the South. He writes that the expulsion of Albanians was intended to \\"make Serbia a pure nation state\\" and to create the possibility \\"that the Serbian actions in the future be directed towards parts of Kosovo\\". The Muhaxhirs were settled mostly in the areas neighboring the border of today's Serbia, in the territory of Kosovo Vushtrri , Podujevo , Gjilan and Ferizaj. Many others Muhaxhirs families also settled in the Republic of Albania. Montenegro In 1877, Nik≈°iƒá was annexed by the Montenegrins in accordance with the Treaty of Berlin. American author William James Stillman (1828‚Äì1901) who traveled in the region at the time writes in his biography of the Montenegrin forces whoo, on the orders of the Prince, began to bomb the Studenica fortress in Niksic with artillery. Around 20 Albanian nizams were inside the fortress who resisted and when the walls breached, they surrendered and asked Stillman if they were going to be decapitated. An Albanian accompanying Stillman translated his words saying they were not going to be killed in which the Albanians celebrated. Shortly after the treaty, the Montenegrin prince began expelling the Albanians from Niksic, Zablyak and Kolasin who then fled to Turkey, Kosovo (Prishtina) and Macedonia. The Montenegrin forces also robbed the Albanians before the expulsion. After the fall of Niksic, Prince Nikola wrote a poem of the victory. After the Balkan wars, new territories inhabited by Albanians became part of Montenegro. Montenegro then gained a part of Malesija, respectively Hoti and Gruda, with Tuzi as center, Plav, Gusinje, Rugovo, Peƒá and Gjakova. During World War I, Albanian immigrants from Nik≈°iƒá who had been expelled to Cetinje sent a letter to Isa Boletini saying that they risked starving if he did not send them money for food. Montenegrin Albanians, Bosniaks and Muslims which were expelled from Montenegro were resettled in Northern and central Albania in Cities like Shkod√´r, Puke, Lezhe and Tirana. Greece During the summer of 1944, the head of the local resistance organization, Napoleon Zervas, asked the Cham Albanians to join EDES in its fight against the left- wing ELAS, but their response was negative. After that and in accordance to orders given specifically to EDES by the Allied forces to push them out of the area, fierce fighting occurred between the two sides. According to British reports, the Cham collaborationist bands managed to flee to Albania with all of their equipment, together with half million stolen cattle as well as 3,000 horses, leaving only the elderly members of the community behind.Hermann Frank Meyer. Blutiges Edelwei√ü: Die 1. Gebirgs-division im zweiten Weltkrieg Bloodstained Edelweiss. The 1st Mountain-Division in WWII Ch. Links Verlag, 2008. (in German) , p. 620 On 18 June 1944, EDES forces with Allied support launched an attack on Paramythia. After short-term conflict against a combined Cham-German garrison, the town was finally under Allied command. Soon after, violent reprisals were carried out against the town's Muslim community, which was considered responsible for the massacre of September 1943. Maximum extent of Cham Albanian dialect: 19th century till 1912/1913 (Hatched line). Population (irrespective of linguistic background) shown by religion: Muslim majority (Brown), Orthodox majority (Pink), Mixed (Light Brown). Colored areas do not imply that Albanian-speakers formed the majority of the population. Moreover, two attacks took place in July and August with the participation of EDES Tenth Division and the local Greek peasants, eager to gain revenge for the burning of their own homes. According to Cham claims, which are not confirmed by British reports, the most infamous massacre of Albanian Muslims by Greek irregulars occurred on 27 June 1944 in the district of Paramithia, when this forces captured the town, killing approximately 600 Muslim Chams, men women and children, many having been raped and tortured before death. British officers described it as \\"a most disgraceful affair involving an orgy of revenge with the local guerrillas looting and wantonly destroying everything\\". British Foreign Office reported that \\"The bishop of Paramythia joined in the searching of houses for booty and came out of one house to find his already heavily laden mule had been meanwhile stripped by some andartes. After the expulsion of the Muslim Chams from Greece, they were spread throughout Albania. The majority of Muslim Chams settled in the outskirts of Vlor√´, Durr√´s and Tirana. Several hundred Chams moved into properties along the Himara coast and to existing villages along the coast such as Borshi, or established entirely new villages, such as Vrina, near the Greek border. Bosnia Many Albanians and Muslims left Bosnia due to discrimination in the newly founded Kingdom of Yugoslavia. They settled in Albania where they enjoyed religious freedoms. The cities of Tirana, Durres, Shkoder and Shijak were particularly popular destinations for immigrants. Caucasus The events of the Circassian genocide, namely the ethnic cleansing, killing, forced migration, and expulsion of the majority of the Circassians from their historical homeland in the Caucasus, resulted in the death of approximately at least 600,000 Caucasian natives up to 1,500,000 deaths, and the successful migration of the remaining of 100,000 - 300,000 Caucasians which immigrated to Kosovo and Albania due to intermittent Russian attacks from 1768 to 1917. The Circassians quickly assimilated into the Muslim Albanian culture and have only limited contact with the Circassian diaspora today. The Circassians founded many villages in Kosovo like Hajvalia in Prishtina. They settled in Cities like Prishtina, Ferizaj and Podujeve and were known by the Albanian society as brave and honest people. North Macedonia Mother Teresa's family lived in Skopje until 1934, when they moved to Tirana. Shortly after the defeat of Turkey by the Balkan allies, a conference of ambassadors of the Great Powers (Britain, Germany, Russia, Austria-Hungary, France, and Italy) convened in London in December 1912 to settle the outstanding issues raised by the conflict. With support given to the Albanians by Austria-Hungary and Italy, the conference agreed to create an independent state of Albania, which became a reality in 1913. However, the boundaries of the new state were drawn in such a way that large areas with Albanian populations remained outside of Albania, including the area that would go on to become the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. During the 20th Century the Albanians and Muslims in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia experienced a period of discrimination. They had neither political rights, let alone religious rights. Characterized by poverty and also by political persecution, many Albanians and Muslims from northern Macedonia settled in the new state of Albania. The immigrants' destinations were Tirana, Elbasan and Shkoder. Egypt Immediately afterwards ‚Äì with the seizure of power by Gamel Abdel Nasser and the subsequent nationalist Arabization policy in Egypt. Many Albanians left Egypt for Albania and were resettled in Korce, Tirana and Durres. Many Albanian families who decided to stay in Egypt were partly assimilated and partly killed from the Army of Gamel Abdel Nasser. With the advent of Gamal Abdel Nasser and the Arab nationalization of Egypt, not only the royal family but also the entire Albanian community of around 4,000 families became the targets of hostility. They were forced to leave the country, thus closing the Albanian chapter in Egypt. In recent times the number of people estimated to be of Albanian heritage in Egypt is 18,000.. \\"Egypt also lays claim to some 18,000 Albanians, supposedly lingering remnants of Mohammad Ali's army.\\" Muhaxhir-Albanians See also * Albanophobia * Expulsion of Cham Albanians * Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars References Category:History of the Albanians Category:History of Kosovo Category:History of modern Greece Category:Muhajir Category:Social history of Albania Category:Social history of Montenegro Category:Yugoslav Serbia ","title":"Muhaxhir (Albanians)"},{"id":"3656926","text":"2,6-Di-tert-butylphenol is an organic compound with the structural formula 2,6-((CH3)3C)2C6H3OH.

The direct grant grammar school would receive partial state funding in return for taking between 25% and 50% of its pupils from state primary schools. Members of the HMC accounted for 58 of the 178 direct grant schools, of which the vast majority were day schools. On average, nearly half of their places were funded by the state.

Life  In 1901, the Missionary Society of Swedish women sent Johansson to Mush (Western Armenia), where she stayed until December, 1915. She worked at a German orphanage for Armenian children. On the outbreak of World War I, the atrocities against the empire's Christian minorities escalated and she became an eyewitness to these crimes against humanity. She wrote about her experiences in a book called Ett folk i landsflykt: Ett √•r ur armeniernas historia (\\"A People in Exile: One Year in the Life of the Armenians\\", Stockholm: Kvinnliga missions arbetare, 1930), both of which were translated into Armenian and French. She also made testimonies to German and American diplomats who published them later. Alma told about how women took poison so they wouldn't be captured by the Turks, and how the soldiers transported bloody, wounded women and children through the city while other soldiers fired at them just to frighten. When the wounded fell to the ground, the soldiers would hit them with the butt ends of their rifles. \\"I can never forget the sight. And nothing could you do for them!\\" she wrote. She gave information about how the kids at the orphanage were handed over to a Turkish officer, and then taken to a building outside the city where they all were murdered. In 1923 Johansson moved to Salonika, and established a factory for more than 200 Armenian refugee women. She also founded an Armenian kindergarten and primary school in Charilaos (Greece). Plaque at Tsitsernakaberd for Alma Johansson (Yerevan, Armenia) In 1997, the Johansson festival was organized in Yerevan. In 2005, on the 90th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, a group of Swedish Armenians visited Alma Johansson's grave at Skogskyrkog√•rden in Enskede, outside Stockholm, to remember these horrifying events and to honour her efforts.

The seminary was closed in 1938 by Nazi Party officials after the Kristallnacht. Commercial Councilor (\\"Kommerzienrath\\") Jonas Fr√§nckel, a descendant of a rabbinic family, and a very wealthy bachelor, who devoted his entire fortune to philanthropic and educational purposes, left a bequest for the establishment of a training- school for rabbis and Jewish teachers. Fr√§nckel was president of the Breslau congregation, and an enthusiastic supporter of Abraham Geiger, who had no doubt inspired the bequest; and it was probably the founder's intention that Geiger should be the president of the institution (Abraham Geiger, \\"Leben in Briefen\\", p. 129, Berlin, 1878). The executors of the Fr√§nckel legacy felt, however, that an institution which should be presided over by a man of Geiger's extreme views would not gain the confidence of the congregations; they therefore called Zecharias Frankel to the presidency (February 7, 1853). Owing to some legal complications, the seminary could not be opened until August 10, 1854, although its constitution had been confirmed by royal order of August 31, 1847. Frankel selected as teachers Heinrich Graetz and Jacob Bernays, to whom Manuel Jo√´l and Benedict Zuckermann were added as assistants, both being soon afterward promoted to the rank of regular teachers.  Original departments  The institution had at the beginning three divisions, namely: the regular rabbinical department, which admitted only such students as were entitled to enter the university; the preparatory department, receiving students who possessed the knowledge required for entrance to the \\"Secunda\\" of a Prussian gymnasium; and a training-school for religious teachers. For a teacher's diploma a three-year course of study was required, while the rabbinical course required seven years. The teachers' seminary, which in the beginning was very well attended, soon declined, and in 1867 was closed on account of lack of students. The preparatory department, originally necessary because the students of the seminary came largely from yeshivot and had no secular training, became superfluous with the increase of students having regular gymnasium education, and was closed in 1887; from then on the seminary had only one department, and provided for theological training only. The administrators of the Fr√§nckel estate inaugurated the seminary with a capital of 100,000 thalers ($72,000) apart from the building and the library; for a teachers' pension fund the sum of 3,000 thalers was set aside; and a stipendiary fund for students was started with 5,000 thalers. The last-named fund received many additions in later years, and special foundations were created for graduates who had not obtained positions, e.g., the Director Frankel Stiftung, founded on the occasion of Zecharias Frankel's seventieth birthday (1861), and a similar foundation on the occasion of Graetz's seventieth birthday (1887); two prizes, one founded by Joseph Lehmann (1855) with a capital of 1,800 marks, and one by David Kaufmann (1895), in memory of David Rosin, with a capital of 4,000 kronen.  Curriculum and staff  The subjects taught at the rabbinical seminary were: Talmudic literature, by the president (\\"Director\\"); history and exegesis, by Heinrich Graetz; philosophy of religion, by Jakob Bernays; homiletics and Midrash, by Manuel Jo√´l; and the calendar by Zuckermann, who was also librarian. This division was changed in details when the teaching staff underwent changes, but remained the same in its general principles. In 1863 Jo√´l became rabbi of Breslau and was succeeded by Jacob Freudenthal, who retained his position at the seminary until 1888, when he was appointed professor of philosophy at Breslau University. In 1866 Bernays was called as professor of philosophy and chief librarian to the University of Bonn, and he was succeeded at the seminary by David Rosin, who held the post until his death (December 31, 1894). After Zecharias Frankel's death (February 13, 1875), Leyser Lazarus was elected president and served as such from September 23, 1875, until his death (April 16, 1879). After Lazarus' death the administration changed. David Jo√´l, brother of Manuel Jo√´l, was called to the institution as professor of the Talmudic branches, with the title of \\"Seminarrabbiner\\", and the presidency was to alternate between him and Professor Graetz as the senior of the faculty. Jo√´l, who entered upon the duties of his office January 1, 1880, died September 9, 1882; and since his death the presidency of the seminary was held in turn by the members of the faculty. Jo√´l was succeeded as \\"Seminarrabbiner\\" by Israel Lewy, who took the chair of Talmudic literature on May 1, 1883. After the death of Graetz (September 7, 1891) Marcus Brann occupied the chair of history, teaching at the same time exegesis and Talmudic codes. After the death of Zuckermann (December 17, 1891) his position as teacher was not filled, Brann assuming the duties of librarian. Upon Rosin's death (December 31, 1894), Saul Horovitz was called (January 1896). He taught philosophy of religion, homiletics, and some of the Talmudic branches; so that by 1904 the professorial staff comprised only three teachers (Lewy, Brann, and Horovitz).  Students  The institution remained faithful to the spirit of its first president, Zecharias Frankel, the principal exponent of \\"positive-historical Judaism\\". It proclaimed freedom in theoretical research, but demanded of its disciples a faithful adherence to the practices of traditional Judaism. It claimed to be the earliest seminary of the modern type, in view of the fact that the S√©minaire Rabbinique of Paris was hardly more than a yeshiva before its removal from Metz. At all events the J√ºdisch-Theologisches Seminar was the first scientific institution for the training of German rabbis; and as such it was the type for those since founded, like Rabbinical Seminary of Budapest and a seminary in Vienna.  Later history  The school was destroyed by the Nazis in 1938.

It is said that the Lepcha king Gyabo Achuk built this fort in 1690 with the help of spirits who brought big round smooth stones from the Reshi river. And the remnants of the fort still do exist. There have been many stories passed from generation to generation about King Gaybo Achuk. It was believed that he used to possess some kind of supernatural powers. There are stories about some hidden treasures guarded by some kind of supernatural forces and also tunnels build by Gyabo Achuk. The fort was initially built to fight the Drukpas of Bhutan. There are many myths about Drukpas fearing to visit the place as it was believed that King Gaybo Achuk was killed by the Drukpa king by forgery. It is said that King Gyabo Achuk used to practice some ancient magic, wherein if his body was cut into two pieces, they would automatically rejoin. So the Drukpa king came up with a plan and lured him into it. The Drukpa king chopped off his head from his body and applied ashes on his half-cut neck so it could not be rejoined, finally resulting in the death of the Lepcha king. It is believed that any Drukpa visiting that place will be struck to death due to some supernatural force. The fort was later used to ward off the forces of the British East India Company. The fort fell into ruin after the 1864 Anglo- Bhutan War. Every year on 20 December, Lepchas from all the adjoining regions (Kalimpong, Darjeeling, Sikkim) come to Damsang Fort to celebrate the birthday of King Gyabo Achuk and to attend some auspicious rituals that is followed from generation to generation by the Lepcha tribes.

Renowned as a man of great ambition, he was a chief strategist and adviser to Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Kuroda became a Christian when he was 38, and received \\"Simeon Josui\\" as a baptismal name (rekishijin). His quick wit, bravery, and loyalty were respected by his warriors.\\"Samurai File 17; Kuroda Kanbei\\". Editorial. Japan World 15 January 2014: 1. Web. 8 Dec. 2015. Early life Kuroda Yoshitaka was born in Himeji on December 22, 1546, as Mankichi (‰∏áÂêâ), the son of Kuroda Mototaka. The Kuroda clan are believed to have originated in ≈åmi Province. Yoshitaka's grandfather Shigetaka brought the family to Himeji and took up residence at Gochaku Castle (Âæ°ÁùÄÂüé), east of Himeji Castle. Shigetaka served as a senior retainer of Kodera Masamoto, the lord of Himeji, and was so highly praised that Shigetaka's son Mototaka was allowed to marry Masamoto's adopted daughter (Akashi Masakaze‚Äôs daughter) and to use the Kodera name. Kuroda became the head of the Kuroda family at the age of 21 when his father, Mototaka, retired.Miura, Akihiko. Kuroda Jhosui. Fukuoka: Nishi Nihon Jinbutsu shi, 1996. Print. Yoshitaka succeeded to the family headship in 1567. Service under Nobunaga and Imprisonment In 1567, he fought in the Siege of Inabayama Castle against the Sait≈ç clan. A few years later, with Toyotomi Hideyoshi spearheading the Oda clan's advance into the Ch≈´goku region, he pledged loyalty to the Oda. Yoshitaka, together with the sickly Takenaka Hanbei, served as Hideyoshi's strategists and assisted in the campaign against the M≈çri clan. In 1577, Arioka/Itami Castle's lord, Araki Murashige, concluded an alliance with the Mouri to revolt against the Oda clan. An ally, Masamoto Kodera, also framed a plot to cooperate with Araki. Then in 1578, Kuroda went to Arioka castle to prevail on Araki not to defect against the Oda. \\"The Reason Why Kanbei was Imprisoned\\". Editorial. Itami n.d. PDF. Araki chose to imprison Yoshitaka instead. Araki's revolt eventually concluded in 1579 at the Siege of Itami, culminating in Yoshitaka's rescue. Due to his long imprisonment (with lack of space for sleeping and sitting), Yoshitaka suffered a leg disorder and lost his eyesight in one eye for the rest of his life. In 1582, he fought in the Siege of Takamatsu against the M≈çri clan. Continued Service under Hideyoshi He fought in the 1582 Battle of Yamazaki under Hideyoshi, avenging the death of Oda Nobunaga. Shortly before 1587, Yoshitaka was ordered by Hideyoshi to lead an attack into Siege of Kagoshima at Kyushu. Along with him was the Christian daimy≈ç Takayama Ukon. After seeing the thriving Christian population of Kyushu, under Ukon's influence, Yoshitaka was baptized with the name „Éâ„É≥„Éª„Ç∑„É°„Ç™„É≥ (Dom Sime√£o = Don Simeon). After a visit to the Jesuit-controlled port of Nagasaki, Hideyoshi became fearful of the powerful influence that Jesuits and the Christian daimy≈çs wielded. In 1587, he made his famous edict that expelled foreign missionaries and ordered all the Christian samurai under his rule to abandon their faith. While Ukon resisted the edict and lost his status, Yoshitaka gave up his new religion and adopted a monk's habit, calling himself Josui (Â¶ÇÊ∞¥). Like Nait≈ç Joan (who took his name from Portuguese Jo√£o), it is believed that Yoshitaka chose his new name from \\"Josu√©\\", the Portuguese version of \\"Joshua\\". His most prominent act during his short time as a Christian was his arrangement to save a Jesuit mission from Bungo when the Christian daimy≈ç of that province, ≈åtomo S≈çrin, was under attack from the Shimazu clan.

It is alleged that Hideyoshi's fear was due to his overwhelming debt to Yoshitaka, having helped him reign over the whole country as his shadow strategist, with Hideyoshi even believing that the Kuroda might overthrow him eventually. In addition, Kuroda deepened a friendship with Sen no Riky≈´, known as the founder of the Japanese tea ceremony \\"wabi-cha\\", and who was later put to death by Hideyoshi himself. Personality Kuroda was a frugal person, and he sold used military equipment and personal belongings to his vassals. He saved enough money to pay mercenaries in the Sekigahara War due to his thrifty mind.

He was also involved in the project to build principal castles: Himeji castle, Nagoya castle, Osaka castle, and Hiroshima castle under the reign of the Toyotomis. Later life Yoshitaka made an attempt to conquer the region of Ky≈´sh≈´ during the Battle of Sekigahara, but this ended up in failure even though he was able to momentarily gain the control of over seven provinces in Ky≈´sh≈´ due to Tokugawa Ieyasu's victory in the Battle of Sekigahara and his conquest of Osaka. After moving to Chikuzen Province (Á≠ëÂâçÂõΩ Chikuzen no kuni) which today is part of Fukuoka Prefecture, the Kuroda built a new castle near Hakata-ku (ÂçöÂ§öÂå∫), and named it Fukuoka Castle (Á¶èÂ≤°Âüé, Fukuoka-j≈ç) also known as Maizuru Castle (ËàûÈ∂¥Âüé Maizuru-j≈ç) or Seki Castle (Áü≥Âüé Seki-j≈ç) which was completed in the early Edo period for tozama daimy≈ç Kuroda Nagamasa.

Produced by Robert Fripp under the musical direction of Keith Tippett, it was originally released 1971 in the UK as a double LP, and 1974 in the US with a different cover. The album was recorded at Wessex Studios, London during three days in June 1971. The album is a four-part suite consisting of four tracks of about 20 minutes each. A remastered CD release (from the original master tapes), using the USA cover, was released in 2000 by BGO. All previous authorized CD releases (on the What Next? and Disconforme labels) were mastered from vinyl sources. Septober Energy - Part 4 is based on the instrumental track Green and Orange Night Park that was part of The Keith Tippett Group's 1970 album Dedicated To You, But You Weren't Listening. Another version, titled Septober Energy and including vocals, can be found on the album The Bristol Concert by Mujician and The Georgian Ensemble, recorded 1991.

The Consulate of the Sea (; ) was a quasi-judicial body set up in the Crown of Aragon, later to spread throughout the Mediterranean basin, to administer maritime and commercial law. The term may also refer to a celebrated collection of maritime customs and ordinances in Catalan language, also known in English as The Customs of the Sea, compiled over the 14th and 15th centuries and published at Valencia in or before 1494. In the 21st century, the Catalan term Consolat de mar is today used for a commercial arbitration service operated by the Barcelona Chamber of Commerce, and also for a series of trade-promotion offices operated by the city of Barcelona. Medieval institution The greatest extent of the territories controlled by the Crown of Aragon, c. 1350 The Catalan institution can be traced to the grant of the Carta Consular to the city of Barcelona by Jaume I of Aragon in 1258.Art. 21, Barcelona Maritime Code of 1258. This gave Barcelona merchants the right to settle their commercial disputes without interference from the royal courts: in return, the king received much needed financial support for his wars of expansion. Mercantile Law (ius mercadorium) was becoming established at the same time through much of Europe, and similar bodies had already been established in Messina (first third of the 13th century) and Genoa (1250).Molin√© y Bras√©s (1914). As the territories of the Crown of Aragon expanded, it was customary to establish new Consulates of the Sea in the major ports. One of the earliest was in Valencia (1283), where the charter of Peter III of Aragon makes it clear that disputes are to be settled \\"according to maritime customs, as these are accepted in Barcelona.\\" Book of the Consulate of the Sea The title page of the 1914 edition of the Book of the Consulate of the Sea, edited by Ernest Molin√© y Bras√©s. The full title in Catalan is Les costums mar√≠times de Barcelona universalment conegudes per Llibre del Consolat de mar, or \\"The maritime customs of Barcelona universally known as the Book of the Consulate of the Sea\\". The earliest extant printed edition of the work (Barcelona, 1494) is without a title-page or frontispiece, but it is described by the above-mentioned title in the epistle dedicatory prefixed to the table of contents. The only known copy of this edition (as of 1911) is preserved in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France in Paris.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition (1911)Jados (1975). The epistle dedicatory states that the work is an amended version of the Book of the Consulate of the Sea, compiled by Francis Celelles with the assistance of numerous shipmasters and merchants well versed in maritime affairs. According to a statement made by Capmany in his Codigo de los costumbras maritimas de Barcelona, published at Madrid in 1791, there was extant to his knowledge an older edition, printed in semi-Gothic characters, which he believed to be of a date prior to 1484. There are, however, two Catalan manuscripts preserved in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, the earliest of which, being MS. Espagnol 124, contains the two first treatises which are printed in the Book of the Consulate of the Sea of 1494, and which are the most ancient portion of its contents, written in a hand of the 14th century, on paper of that century. The subsequent parts of this manuscript are on paper of the 15th century, but there is no document of a date more recent than 1436. The later of the two manuscripts, being MS. Espagnol 56, is written throughout on paper of the 15th century, and in a hand of that century, and it purports, from a certificate on the face of the last leaf, to have been executed under the superintendence of Peter Thomas, a notary public, and the scribe of the Consulate of the Sea at Barcelona. The edition of 1494 contains, in the first place, a code of procedure issued by the kings of Aragon for the guidance of the courts of the consuls of the sea, in the second place, a collection of ancient customs of the sea, and thirdly, a body of rules for the government of cruisers of war. A colophon at the end of these ordinances informs the reader that the book commonly called the Book of the Consulate of the Sea ends here; after which there follows a document known by the title of The Acceptations, which purports to record that the previous chapters and ordinances had been approved by the \\"Roman\\" people in 1075, and by various princes and peoples in the 12th and 13th centuries: this is generally regarded as of no historical value. The paging of the edition of 1494 ceases with this document, at the end of which is the printer's colophon, reciting that the work was completed on 14 July 1494, at Barcelona, by Pere Posa, priest and printer. The remainder of the volume consists of what may be regarded as an appendix to the original Book of the Consulate. This appendix contains various maritime ordinances of the kings of Aragon and of the councillors of the city of Barcelona, ranging over a period from 1271 to 1493. It is printed apparently in the same type with the preceding part of the volume. The original Book of the Consulate of the Sea, coupled with this appendix, circulated in Europe under the title, The Consulate of the Sea, and in the 16th century was translated into the Castilian, the Italian, and the French languages. The Italian translation, printed at Venice c. 1549 by Jean Baptista Pedrezano, was the version that obtained the largest circulation in the north of Europe, and led many jurists to suppose the work to have been of Italian origin. In the next century, the work was translated into Dutch by Westerven, and into German by Engelbrecht, and it is also said to have been translated into Latin. An excellent translation into French of The Customs of the Sea, which are the most valuable portion of the Book of the Consulate, was published by Pardessus in the second volume of his Collection des lois maritimes (Paris, 1834), under the title of La Compilation connue sous le nom do consulat de la mer. See introduction, by Sir Travers Twiss, to the Black Book of the Admiralty (London, 1874), which in the appendix to vol. iii, contains his translation of The Customs of the Sea, with the Catalan text.

She was the first woman to be awarded the titles of Pandita as a Sanskrit scholar and Sarasvati after being examined by the faculty of the University of Calcutta. She was one of the 10 women delegates of the Congress session of 1889. In the late 1890s, she founded Mukti Mission at Kedgaon village, forty miles east of the city of Pune. The mission was later named Pandita Ramabai Mukti Mission. Early life and education Pandita Ramabai Sarasvati was born as Rama Dongre on 23 April 1858 in a Marathi speaking Brahmin family but later she adopted Christianity in England. Her father, Anant Shastri Dongre, a Sanskrit scholar, taught her Sanskrit at home. Orphaned at the age of 16 during the Great Famine of 1876‚Äì78, Dongre and her brother Srinivas traveled over India reciting Sanskrit scriptures. Ramabai's fame as a lecturer reached Calcutta, where the pandits invited her to speak.My Story by Pandita Ramabai. Pub: Christian Institute for Study of Religion and Society, Bangalore. In 1878, Calcutta University, conferred on her the titles of Pandita and Sarasvati in recognition of her knowledge of various Sanskrit works. The theistic reformer Keshab Chandra Sen gave her a copy of the Vedas, the most sacred of all Hindu literature, and encouraged her to read them. After the death of Srinivas in 1880, Ramabai married Bipin Behari Medhvi, a Bengali lawyer. The groom was a Bengali Kayastha, and so the marriage was inter-caste and inter-regional and therefore considered inappropriate for that age. They were married in a civil ceremony on 13 November 1880. The couple had a daughter whom they named Manorama. After Medhvi's death in 1882, Ramabai, who was only 23, moved to Pune and founded an organization to promote women's education. Social activism After Medhvi's death (1882), Ramabai moved to Pune where she founded Arya Mahila Samaj (Arya Women's Society). The purpose of the society was to promote the cause of women's education and deliverance from the oppression of child marriage. When in 1882 a commission was appointed by Government of India to look into education, Ramabai gave evidence before it. In an address to Lord Ripon's Education Commission, she declared with fervor, \\"In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the educated men of this country are opposed to female education and the proper position of women. If they observe the slightest fault, they magnify the grain of mustard-seed into a mountain, and try to ruin the character of a woman.\\" She suggested that teachers be trained and women school inspectors be appointed. Further, she said that as the situation in India was that women's conditions were such that women could only medically treat them, Indian women should be admitted to medical colleges. Ramabai's evidence created a great sensation and reached Queen Victoria. It bore fruit later in starting of the Women's Medical Movement by Lord Dufferin. Ramabai went to Britain in 1883 to start medical training; she was rejected from medical programs because of progressive deafness. During her stay she converted to Christianity. From Britain she traveled to the United States in 1886 to attend the graduation of her relative and the first female Indian doctor, Anandibai Joshi, staying for two years. During this time she also translated textbooks and gave lectures throughout the United States and Canada. She had also published one of her most important book, The High-Caste Hindu Woman. This was also the first book that she wrote in English. Ramabai dedicated this book to Dr. Joshi, The High-Caste Hindu Woman-to be specific a Brahmin woman which showed the darkest aspects of the life of Hindu women, including child brides and child widows, sought to expose the oppression of women in Hindu-dominated British India. While giving presentations in the U.S. to seek support for her work in India, Ramabai met Frances Willard in July 1887. Willard invited Ramabai to speak at the national Woman's Christian Temperance Union convention in November 1887 where she gained the support of this large women's organization. She returned to India in June of 1888 as a National Lecturer for the WCTU. Mary Greenleaf Clement Leavitt, the first World Missionary of the WCTU, was already there when Ramabai returned, but they did not meet. Ramabai worked however with the WCTU of India once it was officially organized in 1893. In 1896, during a severe famine, Ramabai toured the villages of Maharashtra with a caravan of bullock carts and rescued thousands of outcast children, child widows, orphans, and other destitute women and brought them to the shelter of Mukti and Sharada Sadan. A learned woman knowing seven languages, she also translated the Bible into her mother tongue‚ÄîMarathi‚Äîfrom the original Hebrew and Greek. By 1900 there were 1,500 residents and over a hundred cattle in the Mukti mission and she was also involved in establishing a Church at Mukti. The Pandita Ramabai Mukti Mission is still active today, providing housing, education, vocational training, etc. for many needy groups including widows, orphans, and the blind. Family life As Pandita Ramabai involved herself in social service, there was little family life for her. Her childhood was full of hardships, she lost her parents early and her husband died within two years of marriage. She had also to educate her only daughter, Manorama Bai. She did this well: Manorama completed her BA at Bombay University; went to the US for higher studies; returned to India, and worked as Principal of Sharada Sadan, Mumbai. With her help, Pandita Ramabai established Christian High school at Gulbarga (now in Karnataka), a backward district of south India, during 1912, and her daughter was the Principal of the school. In 1920 Ramabai's body began to flag and she designated her daughter as the one who would take over the ministry of Mukti Mission. However, Manorama died in 1921. Her death was a shock to Ramabai. Nine months later, Ramabai, who had been suffering from septic bronchitis, died on 5 April 1922, a few weeks before her 64th birthday.Panditha Ramabai Sarasvathi ‚Äì Book in Kannada (1962) Pub by Christ Sahitya Sangha, Bangalore  Ramabai circles and issues  Ramabai on a 1989 stamp of India Swami Vivekananda mentions about Ramabai in his letters. \\"I am astonished to hear the scandals the Ramabai circles are indulging in about me.

Life and work Goedsche was born in Trachenberg, Silesia, then in the Kingdom of Prussia, today part of Poland. In 1848 he worked for the Neue Preu√üische (Kreuz-)Zeitung newspaper, together with prominent Germans like Theodor Fontane, Otto von Bismarck and George Hesekiel. In 1853, he travelled as a journalist to Turkey. Goedsche worked in the genre of historical romance novel, as typified by Sir Walter Scott, Charles Sealsfield and Theodor M√ºgge, but he was also influenced by authors like Eug√®ne Sue, Alexandre Dumas, p√®re and George Hesekiel. Some of his works are critical of British colonialism. He was openly antisemitic and, although adopting an English pseudonym, he was a Prussian chauvinist who held a profound aversion against Britain and everything British. His political views on \\"perfidious Albion\\" are clearly expressed in his novels. Goedsche worked as a postal employee, but in reality he was an agent provocateur for the Prussian secret police. He forged letters which were used as evidence to frame democratic leaders. In 1849, he was caught after forging evidence in the prosecution of political reformer Benedict Waldeck and had to leave the postal service.Keren, Daniel, Commentary on The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, 10 February 1993. Republished as accompanying introduction to The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion translated by Victor E Marsden. [The relevant part is on page 4 of the pdf file.] He died at Bad Warmbrunn, today Cieplice ≈ölƒÖskie-Zdr√≥j in Jelenia G√≥ra, in 1878. = Role in fabricating Jewish conspiracy theory = In his 1868 book Biarritz, Goedsche plagiarized a book by the French satirist Maurice Joly, The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu, and made an addition: the chapter \\"At the Jewish Cemetery in Prague\\" described a secret rabbinical cabal, Council of Representatives of The Twelve Tribes of Israel, which meets in the cemetery at midnight for one of their centennial meetings. They report on the progress of their long-term conspiracy to establish world domination. Among the methods to achieve this goal are the acquisition of landed property, the transformation of craftsmen into industrial workers, the infiltration into high public offices, the control of the press, and so on. The chairman Levit expresses at the end of the meeting the desire to be the kings of the world in 100 years. This fictional \\"Rabbi's Speech\\" was frequently quoted later as an authentic episode and invoked as a proof of the authenticity of the forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion for which, in fact, it is considered to have been a source.. In Nazi Germany the chapter was re-printed independently in many editions.\\"The Jew in the modern world: a documentary history\\", by Paul R. Mendes-Flohr, Jehuda Reinharz, 1995, , a footnote at p. 363 To portray the meeting, Goedsche borrowed heavily from the scene in the novel Joseph Balsamo by Alexandre Dumas, p√®re in which Alessandro Cagliostro and company plot the affair of the diamond necklace, and likewise borrowed Joly's Dialogues as the outcome of the meeting.

The medical school teaches medical students for the first three years of their training, with students completing this training at different medical schools in the UK. The school is associated with 1 Nobel Prize and 2 Victoria Cross winners. Famous alumni include small pox vaccine pioneer Edward Jenner and inventor of beta blockers and H2 receptor antagonists, Nobel Prize in Medicine winner Sir James Black. History =The early medical school= Medicine was the third subject to be taught at the University of St Andrews, at St Salvator's College and later the United College of St Salvator and St Leonard. Bishop Kennedy founded St Salvator's College in 1450, confirmed by a Papal Bull in 1458. From the 17th to the 19th centuries, medical degrees from St Andrews were awarded by an early version of distance learning. The university awarded the degree of MD to individuals who were usually already established in medical practice, the first being conferred in 1696. This degree was awarded on the basis of a testimonial written by a supervisor, and a fee was paid to the university. The whole process was conducted through the post, and the candidate did not have to visit the university. Recipients of the MD at this time include the French Revolutionary, Jean-Paul Marat (1743‚Äì1793), who obtained his MD in 1775 for an essay on gonorrhea, and Edward Jenner (1749‚Äì1823), who developed the first smallpox vaccine, and was awarded the MD in 1792. In 1721, whilst Chancellor of the University, James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos established the Chandos Chair of Medicine and Anatomy, to fund the appointment of a Professor of Medicine and Anatomy at the university, and Thomas Simson was appointed as the first Chandos Professor. The Chandos Chair still exists, although it has now become a chair of physiology. In the early 19th century, examinations were introduced. Students had to visit St Andrews to sit them, but there was no teaching at the university. =The founding of the Bute Medical School= In 1897, as Rector of the University of St Andrews, the 3rd Marquess of Bute, in addition to his provident restorations of other university buildings, initiated the construction of the current Bute Medical Buildings, south of St Mary's College, completed in 1899. The buildings, much added to and modified, especially after a gift from Andrew Carnegie, built labs to the north (now the Carnegie Building). These provided for the establishment of a regular medical school, which both taught and examined medical students. The 3rd Marquess of Bute also provided for the establishment of a new chair of medicine‚Äîthe Bute Chair of Medicine. Bute Medical Building =The St Andrews-Dundee course= In 1898, University College Dundee - which had been created in 1891 - became affiliated to the University of St Andrews, and it was this that enabled a full undergraduate medical degree to be offered by St Andrews, as the City of Dundee had a large population and contained several hospitals where students could receive clinical teaching. Together, the Bute Medical School and clinical facilities at University College Dundee formed a conjoint medical school. Medical students could either undertake their pre-clinical teaching at the Bute Medical School in St Andrews or go straight to Dundee for their pre- clinical years, and then the two groups combined to complete their clinical training in Dundee. Students were awarded the degree of MB ChB by the University of St Andrews. In 1954, University College Dundee changed its name to Queen's College, but remained part of the University of St Andrews. In August 1967, following recommendations by the Robbins Report, the Universities (Scotland) Act 1966 came into force. This separated Queen's College from the University of St Andrews, and granted independent university status to the new University of Dundee. In a great many respects, the medical school at the University of Dundee is the direct inheritor of the medical traditions of St Andrews University. The same can be said of the Dundee dental school. As the clinical part of the medical school (along with other parts of the University of St Andrews, including the Law and Engineering Faculties) had been completely based in Dundee, this left St Andrews with no clinical medical school or teaching hospital in which medical students could receive clinical training. The Universities (Scotland) Act 1966 also removed the University of St Andrews's right to award undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in medicine, including the MBChB and MD. However, in more recent times the right to award the MD (St Andrews) has been restored. =The link with Manchester Medical School= In order to continue to be able to offer access to a medical degree, St Andrews established a new link with the English Victoria University of Manchester in 1970, which was at that time seeking to enlarge its medical school. Students completed a three-year BSc in medical science at St Andrews, and could optionally complete an extra intercalated year for the award of BSc Hons at St Andrews, before completing their clinical training at the University of Manchester, with the final MBChB awarded by Manchester. For a brief period there was the option of completing clinical training at Keele University Medical School in Stoke-on-Trent, and around twenty St Andrews graduates each year between 2002‚Äì2006 went to Keele University. This option no longer exists. =Recent history= Major changes to the curriculum were made in 2000 with increased emphasis on psychology and cellular biology, with the introduction of a two-year course in cellular and molecular medicine and a three-year course in behavioural sciences. Further curriculum changes took place in 2004, with a reduction in the amount of teaching but the introduction of a research project into the final year, allowing for an honours degree to be attained after three years' study, and therefore since September 2005, the Bute Medical School has offered a Bachelor of Science with honours in Medicine (BSc Hons Medicine). Admissions St Andrews is one of a few schools in the UK to use the multiple mini interview, an interview system first developed by McMaster University Medical School which exposes applicants to several interviews of shorter time, exposing the applicant to more interviewers and reducing the chance that one bad or good interview determines the applicants success at gaining admissions. Courses = Medical degree programme = The BSc (Hons) programme is three years long; on graduating from St Andrews, students will progress to one of the University's partner medical schools in Scotland or England for a further three years. Applicants who are ‚Äòoverseas‚Äô for fee purposes will progress to the Medical School at the University of Manchester. At the end of the six year programme, students will have completed their training as a doctor and graduate with MBChB/MBBS.  First year  In the first year of the course, the modules provide an scientific foundation for clinical practice. Students also commence communication and clinical skills training, alongside patient interaction, which continues throughout all three years.  Second year  The Honours programme, which runs through both second and third year, focuses in detail upon the normal function and dysfunction of specific physiological systems. Students attend a range of community based clinical placements.  Third year  In third year, the first semester focuses on complex integrative physiological systems (central nervous system and endocrine organs). Semester 2 is focused on a significant student-selected Honours research project, as well as the application of medicine and developing clinical skills. Students participate in secondary care based clinical placements. = Scottish Graduate Entry Medicine (ScotGEM) = ScotGEM is an intensive four-year graduate entry medicine programme run by the universities of St Andrews and Dundee in collaboration with four health boards: NHS Fife, Tayside, Highland and Dumfries and Galloway. The course is led for first and second year by the University of St Andrews and in third and fourth year by the University of Dundee. The course focuses on rural medicine and healthcare improvement with students living and studying in rural areas from second year onwards. The course undertook its first cohort of students in 2019 with the intention of graduating students in September 2022 and awarding a joint degree from the University of St Andrews and the University of Dundee. =Postgraduate= In 2002 the Scottish Parliament passed the University of St Andrews (Postgraduate Medical Degrees) Act 2002 which re- instated the university's right to award the postgraduate research degree of Medicinae Doctor (MD) to students who have completed two years of full-time or up to 5 years of part-time research, which had been removed by the Universities (Scotland) Act 1966. The first MD since 1967 was awarded in 2004. Facilities and buildings New Medical SchoolThe University of St Andrews‚Äô new Medical and Biological Sciences Building brings together the medical school (relocated from the Bute Building), biologists, physicists and chemists, while also linking to the School of Physics and Astronomy via a first-floor bridge‚Äîmaking it one of the first medical schools in the UK to fully integrate research facilities across the sciences. The School, which has been built at a cost of ¬£45m, contains research laboratory space, as well as teaching facilities and a lecture theatre. Medical Societies Over recent years, many medical societies have been developed, alongside the historical Bute Medical Society, to help incorporate the clinical aspects into the course‚Äîone which was traditionally science-based only. These societies include Surgical, Clinical and a Medsin group. =The Bute Medical Society= Bute Medical School Scarf The Bute Medical Society was founded in 1915, by its first president Margaret Shirlaw, with the support of Miss Mildred Clark, Calum McCrimmon, Clive Mackie Whyte, Cecily Thistlewaite, Mary Ellison and W.G. Robertson. The initial aim of the society was to hold clinically oriented lectures that the students could attend voluntarily. This tradition still continues today with the society's bimonthly 'cheese and wine' evening. As an independent, non-profit organisation it is still run entirely by medical students, supported by some sponsorship. Fundraising events held throughout the year also enable the Society to contribute to charities. =Surgical Society= In 2009, a small group of students set up the University's first surgical interest society. Since then, a multitude of lectures, skills workshops and anatomy revision tutorials have been run by the society and it continues to grow in size. The Robert Walmsley Lecture was created in 2011 as a yearly event held in the old Bute Buildings to commemorate this previous setting of the teaching of medicine in St Andrews; the inaugural lecture was delivered by David Sinclair. Research Research at the school is grouped into three main areas: People and Populations, Molecular Medicine and Medical Photonics. Much of the research is interdisciplinary especially in medical photonics where close links with the School of Physics exist. There are groups involved in child health and development, cell signaling, cancer, neurobiology, infection, cell biology and molecular psychiatry. Research Institutes: *WHO Collaborating Centre for International Child & Adolescent Health Policy *Child and Adolescent Health Research Unit (CAHRU) *Scottish Healthcare Associated Infection Prevention Institute Academic dress St Andrews undergraduate medical students are members of the United College of St Salvator and St Leonard, and as such wear the scarlet gown with burgundy velvet collar for official academic occasions. They graduate as a BSc or BSc (Hons) and so wear a black gown with a fuchsia hood trimmed with white fur. On graduation from Manchester they are entitled to wear a black gown with scarlet hood trimmed with white fur, and black cap. When postgraduate students graduate with the MD degree, they wear a black gown with a crimson hood with a white lining, alternatively they may wear a crimson gown.

She competes with other professional female downhill mountain bike racers. She entered the sport in 2001, six years after completing gender reassignment surgery, when she was discovered riding on Vancouver's North Shore by several top women mountain bikers. Dumaresq is quite open about gender identity. Gender Identity Dumaresq had gender confirmation surgery performed in 1996, after receiving hormonal therapy for a considerable time. Since 2004, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), whose rules are used commonly throughout competitive sport, has allowed transgender individuals to compete in the division which matches their gender identity as long as the individual has had a blood testosterone level not exceeding 10 nmol/L for at least the preceding 12 months. In Dumaresq's case, she had undergone a gonadectomy six years prior to beginning competition and had been on hormones for well over six years. Competitive career The first event Dumaresq entered was the Bear Mountain race held in Mission, BC in May 2001. She entered the novice female class and won. In fact, her finish time was 2.5 seconds faster than the winner of the female professional category. After racing two more races, her license was suspended by Cycling BC due to complaints from female competitors. Cycling BC and the Canadian Cycling Association met privately with local organizers and at first suggested that Dumaresq quit racing. After discussion with the UCI the decision was made to permit Dumaresq to continue competing in the women's category. Dumaresq was not permitted to compete in the men's category since she is a woman legally and medically in addition to psychologically. In April 2002, she was awarded a license to race in the women's category. Three weeks later, she entered her first race in the pro women's class and finished 3rd. The following week she placed 1st, beating her competition by 10 seconds. A wave of protest ensued and a petition was created and signed by female (and a few male) racers, asking for Dumaresq to be disqualified. Because she had a race license, the request was denied and her first professional win with females was upheld. Dumaresq went on to win the 2002 Canada Cup series, which qualified her for the Canadian National team. Later on, in September 2002, she co-represented Canada at the World Mountain Bike Championships. However, due to technical issues with her bike, Dumaresq only managed a 24th-place finish in the event. In 2003, Dumaresq won the 2003 Canadian National Championships and again represented Canada in the 2003 World Championships. She repeated her Nationals win in 2004 and finished 17th at the 2004 World Mountain Bike Championships held in Les Gets, France. At the 2006 Canadian Nationals, a protest from one of her competitors during the podium ceremonies brought renewed attention to Dumaresq's participation in female sports. The boyfriend of second-place finisher Danika Schroeter jumped up onto the podium and helped Schroeter put on a T-shirt reading '100% Pure Woman Champ'. The Canadian Cycling Association suspended Schroeter for her actions. However, in a controversial move, the CCA announced that Schroeter's time off the race course would be served during the off-season when it would have no impact on her.

She performed classical and light classical music and helped elevate the profile of thumri. She died on 24 October 2017. Early life Girija Devi was born in Varanasi, on 8 May 1929, to Ramdeo Rai, a zamindar. Her father played the harmonium and taught music, and had Girija Devi take lessons in singing khyal and tappa from vocalist and sarangi player Sarju Prasad Misra starting at the age of five. She starred in the movie Yaad rahe aged nine and continued her studies under Sri Chand Misra in a variety of styles. Performing career Devi in 2006 Girija Devi made her public debut in 1949 on All India Radio Allahabad, after marrying a businessman circa 1946, but faced opposition from her mother and grandmother because it was traditionally believed that no upper-class woman should perform publicly. Girija Devi agreed not to perform privately for others, but gave her first public concert in Bihar in 1951. She studied with Sri Chand Misra until he died in the early 1960s, worked as a faculty member of the ITC Sangeet Research Academy in Kolkata in the 1980s and of the Banaras Hindu University during the early 1990s, and taught several students to preserve her musical heritage. Girija Devi often toured and continued to perform in 2009. Girija Devi sang in the Banaras gharana and performed the purabi ang thumri style typical of the tradition, whose status she helped elevate. Her repertoire included the semi-classical genres kajri, chaiti, and holi and she sang khyal, Indian folk music, and tappa. The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians once stated that her semi-classical singing combined her classical training with the regional characteristics of the songs of Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh.

They are employed when reticulation events such as hybridization, horizontal gene transfer, recombination, or gene duplication and loss are believed to be involved. They differ from phylogenetic trees by the explicit modeling of richly linked networks, by means of the addition of hybrid nodes (nodes with two parents) instead of only tree nodes (a hierarchy of nodes, each with only one parent). Phylogenetic trees are a subset of phylogenetic networks. Phylogenetic networks can be inferred and visualised with software such as SplitsTree, the R-package, phangorn, and, more recently, Dendroscope. A standard format for representing phylogenetic networks is a variant of Newick format which is extended to support networks as well as trees. Many kinds and subclasses of phylogenetic networks have been defined based on the biological phenomenon they represent or which data they are built from (hybridization networks, usually built from rooted trees, recombination networks from binary sequences, median networks from a set of splits, optimal realizations and reticulograms from a distance matrix), or restrictions to get computationally tractable problems (galled trees, and their generalizations level-k phylogenetic networks, tree-child or tree-sibling phylogenetic networks). Microevolution Phylogenetic trees also have trouble depicting microevolutionary events, for example the geographical distribution of muskrat or fish populations of a given species among river networks, because there is no species boundary to prevent gene flow between populations. Therefore, a more general phylogenetic network better depicts these situations. Rooted vs unrooted ;Unrooted phylogenetic network :Let X be a set of taxa. An unrooted phylogenetic network N on X is any undirected graph whose leaves are bijectively labeled by the taxa in X. A number of different types of unrooted phylogenetic networks are in use like split networks and quasi-median networks. In most cases, such networks only depict relations between taxa, without giving information about the evolutionary history. Although some methods produce unrooted networks that can be interpreted as undirected versions of rooted networks, which do represent a phylogeny. ;Rooted phylogenetic network :Let X be a set of taxa. A rooted phylogenetic network N on X is a rooted directed acyclic graph where the set of leaves is bijectively labeled by the taxa in X. Rooted phylogenetic networks, like rooted phylogenetic trees, give explicit representations of evolutionary history. This means that they visualize the order in which the species diverged (speciated), converged (hybridized), and transferred genetic material (horizontal gene transfer).  Classes of networks  For computational purposes, studies often restrict their attention to classes of networks: subsets of all networks with certain properties. Although computational simplicity is the main goal, most of these classes have a biological justification as well. Some prominent classes currently used in the mathematical phylogenetics literature are tree-child networks, tree-based networks, and level-k networks Software to compute phylogenetic networks *PhyloNet, A Java-based software package that builds phylogenetic networks taking ILS, HGT etc. into consideration. *Network, Free Phylogenetic Network Software.

It was developed between the years 1989 to 2007 at the University of Alberta, by a team led by Jonathan Schaeffer and consisting of Rob Lake, Paul Lu, Martin Bryant, and Norman Treloar. The program's algorithms include an opening book which is a library of opening moves from games played by checkers grandmasters; a deep search algorithm; a good move evaluation function; and an end-game database for all positions with eight pieces or fewer. All of Chinook's knowledge was programmed by its creators, rather than learned using an artificial intelligence system. Man vs. Machine World Champion Chinook is the first computer program to win the world champion title in a competition against humans. In 1990 it won the right to play in the human World Championship by being second to Marion Tinsley in the US Nationals. At first the American Checkers Federation and English Draughts Association were against the participation of a computer in a human championship. When Tinsley resigned his title in protest, the ACF and EDA created the new title Man vs. Machine World Championship, and competition proceeded. Tinsley won with four wins to Chinook's two, with 33 draws. In a rematch, Chinook was declared the Man- Machine World Champion in checkers in 1994 in a match against Marion Tinsley after six drawn games, and Tinsley's withdrawal due to pancreatic cancer. While Chinook became the world champion, it never defeated the best checkers player of all time, Tinsley, who was significantly superior to even his closest peer.1994 Chinook-Tinsley checkers match In 1995, Chinook defended its man-machine title against Don Lafferty in a 32-game match. The final score was 1‚Äì0 with 31 draws for Chinook over Lafferty.Details of the 1995 Man vs. Machine World Championship After the match, Jonathan Schaeffer decided not to let Chinook compete any more, but instead try to solve checkers. At the time it was rated at 2814 Elo. The solution was achieved, and the result published in 2007. Algorithm Chinook's program algorithm includes an opening book, a library of opening moves from games played by grandmasters; a deep search algorithm; a good move evaluation function; and an end-game database for all positions with eight pieces or fewer. The linear handcrafted evaluation function considers several features of the game board, including piece count, kings count, trapped kings, turn, runaway checkers (unimpeded path to be kinged) and other minor factors.

It varies gear tooth profiles, and/or pins along the faces of freewheel or cassette sprockets, or between the chainrings in a crankset, to ease shifting between them. Development The design, developed by Shimano, improves on their earlier Uniglide design (which used beveled/twisted gear teeth instead of ramps), and was introduced as part of a commercially viable index shifting system. The Hyperglide ramps, along with laterally floating derailleur jockey wheels, allows for enough \\"slop\\" in the system to make indexed shifting reliable, despite variations in shift cable adjustment and manufacturing or assembly tolerances. A Hyperglide freewheel or cassette on a bike with friction shifters can further improve shifting. Design The individual sprockets on a Hyperglide cassette or freewheel are designed specifically to work with their neighbours. For example, the 18-tooth sprocket on a wide-range cassette (such as one for a mountain bike) will have a different ramp pattern than the 18-tooth sprocket on a narrow-range cassette, because the number of teeth on the neighbouring sprocket requires a different ramp pattern for an optimal shift. As a result, cassettes are sold as a cohesive unit‚Äîrather than as individual sprockets‚Äîwith all the sprockets on a given cassette designed to work with each other. However, some mixing and matching is possible for a custom gear range, as long as all the sprockets' ramps are compatible. In order to ensure alignment of each sprocket with its neighbour, the freehub has a narrow spline at one position, and each sprocket has a corresponding wide tooth on its inside face. Interactive glide The interactive glide gear system is an extension of hyperglide, in which both sides of the bicycle gear sprockets are physically contoured to improve upshifting. Interactive glide sprockets are slightly thicker than hyperglide variants, and due to this difference, some Shimano Hyperglide chains may hang up if used on an interactive glide cassette. The slightly wider interactive glide chains work on either type, as do SRAM chains. The IG chains are wider internally but narrower externally than the standard HG chains that Shimano made at the same time; the plates of the chains are thinner.

She has been called \\"one of the greatest avant-garde women artists of the early 20th century\\" and a \\"pioneer\\" in modern Indian art. Drawn to painting from an early age, Sher-Gil started getting formal lessons in the art, at the age of eight. She first gained recognition at the age of 19, for her oil painting titled Young Girls (1932). Sher-Gil traveled throughout her life to various countries including Turkey, France, and India, deriving heavily from precolonial Indian art styles and its current culture. Sher-Gil is considered an important painter of 20th-century India, whose legacy stands on a level with that of the pioneers from the Bengal Renaissance. She was also an avid reader and a pianist. Sher-Gil's paintings are among the most expensive by Indian women painters today, although few acknowledged her work when she was alive. Early life and education Amrita with her sister Indira, 1922 Amrita Sher-Gil was born on 30 January 1913Great Minds, The Tribune, 12 March 2000. in Budapest, Hungary, to Umrao Singh Sher-Gil Majithia, a Jat aristocrat and a scholar in Sanskrit and Persian, and Marie Antoniette Gottesmann, a Hungarian-Jewish opera singer who came from an affluent bourgeois family. Her parents first met in 1912, while Marie Antoinette was visiting Lahore. Her mother came to India as a companion of Princess Bamba Sutherland, the granddaughter of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Sher- Gil was the elder of two daughters; her younger sister was Indira Sundaram (n√©e Sher-Gil), born in March 1914), mother of the contemporary artist Vivan Sundaram. She spent most of early childhood in Budapest. She was the niece of Indologist Ervin Baktay. Baktay noticed Sher-Gil's artistic talents during his visit to Shimla in 1926 and was an advocate of Sher-Gil pursuing art. He guided her by critiquing her work and gave her an academic foundation to grow on. When she was a young girl she would paint the servants in her house, and get them to model for her. The memories of these models would eventually lead to her return to India.On Amrita Sher-Gil: Claiming a Radiant Legacy By Nilima Sheikh Her family faced financial problems in Hungary. In 1921, her family moved to Summer Hill, Shimla, India, and Sher-Gil soon began learning piano and violin. By age nine she, along with her younger sister Indira, was giving concerts and acting in plays at Shimla's Gaiety Theatre at Mall Road, Shimla.Amrita Shergill at sikh-heritage. Sikh-heritage.co.uk (30 January 1913). Though she was already painting since the age of five, she formally started learning painting at age eight. Sher-Gil started getting formal lessons in the art by Major Whitmarsh, who was later replaced by Beven Pateman. In Shimla, Sher-Gil lived a relatively privileged lifestyle. As a child, she was expelled from her convent school for declaring herself an atheist. In 1923, Marie came to know an Italian sculptor, who was living at Shimla at the time. In 1924, when he returned to Italy, she too moved there along with Amrita and got her enrolled at Santa Annunziata, an art school at Florence. Though Amrita didn't stay at this school for long and returned to India in 1924, it was here that she was exposed to works of Italian masters.Amrita Shergill Biography at. Iloveindia.com (6 December 1941). At sixteen, Sher-Gil sailed to Europe with her mother to train as a painter at Paris, first at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re under Pierre Vaillent and Lucien Simon (where she met Boris Taslitzky) and later at the √âcole des Beaux- Arts (1930‚Äì34).Archives 'Amrita Shergil' project www.hausderkunst.de.Amrita Sher-Gil profile at . Indianartcircle.com. She drew inspiration from European painters such as Paul C√©zanne and Paul Gauguin, while working under the influence of her teacher Lucien Simon and the company of artist friends and lovers like Tazlitsky. While in Paris, she is said to have painted with a conviction and maturity rarely seen in a 16-year old. In 1931, Sher-Gil was briefly engaged to Yusuf Ali Khan, but rumors spread that she was also having an affair with her first cousin and later husband Victor Egan. Her letters reveal same-sex affairs. Career = 1932‚Äì1936: Early career, European and Western styles = Young Girls, 1932, oil on canvas, 133√ó164 cm, National Gallery of Modern Art, Delhi Sher-Gil's early paintings display a significant influence of the Western modes of painting, more specifically, the post- impressionism style. She practiced a lot in the Bohemian circles of Paris in the early 1930s. Her 1932 oil painting, Young Girls, came as a breakthrough for her; the work won her accolades, including a gold medal and election as an Associate of the Grand Salon in Paris in 1933. She was the youngest ever member,Anand, Armita Sher-GilWorks in Focus, Tate Modern, 2007.Amrita Shergil at tate. En.ce.cn. and the only Asian to have received this recognition. Her work during this time include a number of self-portraits, as well as life in Paris, nude studies, still life studies, and portraits of friends and fellow students. The National Gallery of Modern Art in New Delhi describes her self- portraits she made while in Paris as \\"[capturing] the artist in her many moods ‚Äì somber, pensive, and joyous ‚Äì while revealing a narcissistic streak in her personality.\\" Sleep, 1932, oil on canvas 112.5 √ó 79 cm, National Gallery of Modern Art, Delhi When she was in Paris, one of her professors often said that judging by the richness of her colouring Sher-Gil was not in her element in the west, and that her artistic personality would find its true atmosphere in east. In 1933, Sher-Gil \\"began to be haunted by an intense longing to return to India [...] feeling in some strange way that there lay my destiny as a painter.\\" Sher-Gill returned to India at the end of 1934.Laid bare ‚Äì the free spirit of Indian art The Daily Telegraph, 24 February 2007. In May 1935, Sher- Gil met the English journalist Malcolm Muggeridge, then working as Assistant Editor and leader writer for The Calcutta Statesman. Both Muggeridge and Sher- Gil stayed at the family home at Summer Hill, Shimla and a short intense affair took place during which she painted a casual portrait of her new lover, the painting now with the National Gallery of Modern Art in New Delhi. By September 1935 Amrita saw Muggeridge off as he traveled back to England for new employment. She left herself for travel in 1936 at the behest of an art collector and critic, Karl Khandalavala, who encouraged her to pursue her passion for discovering her Indian roots.Amrita Sher-Gil Exhibition at tate.org In India, she began a quest for the rediscovery of the traditions of Indian art which was to continue till her death. She was greatly impressed and influenced by the Mughal and Pahari schools of painting and the cave paintings at Ajanta. South Indian Villagers Going to Market, 1937. = 1937‚Äì1941: Later career, influence of Indian art = Later in 1937, she toured South India and produced her South Indian trilogy of paintings Bride's Toilet, Brahmacharis, and South Indian Villagers Going to Market following her visit to the Ajanta Caves, when she made a conscious attempt to return to classical Indian art. These paintings reveal her passionate sense of color and an equally passionate empathy for her Indian subjects, who are often depicted in their poverty and despair.Amrita Shergill at. Indiaprofile.com (6 December 1941). By now the transformation in her work was complete and she had found her 'artistic mission' which was, according to her, to express the life of Indian people through her canvas. While in Saraya Sher-Gil wrote to a friend thus: \\"I can only paint in India. Europe belongs to Picasso, Matisse, Braque.... India belongs only to me\\". Her stay in India marks the beginning of a new phase in her artistic development, one that was distinct from the European phase of the interwar years when her work showed an engagement with the works of Hungarian painters, especially the Nagybanya school of painting.Daily Times, 15 December 2004. Dailytimes.com.pk (15 December 2004). Sher-Gil married her Hungarian first cousin, Dr. Victor Egan when she was 25. Dr. Egan had helped Sher-Gil obtain abortions on at least two occasions prior to their marriage. She moved with him to India to stay at her paternal family's home in Saraya, Sardar nagar, Chauri Chaura in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh. Thus began her second phase of painting which equals in its impact on Indian art with the likes of Rabindranath Tagore and Jamini Roy of the Bengal school of art. The 'Calcutta Group' of artists, which transformed the Indian art scene, was to start only in 1943, and the 'Progressive Artist's Group', with Francis Newton Souza, Ara, Bakre, Gade, M. F. Husain and S. H. Raza among its founders, lay further ahead in 1948.Amrita Sher-Gill at. Mapsofindia.com.Contemporary Art Movements in India. Contemporaryart-india.com.Indian artists. Art.in. Amrita's art was strongly influenced by the paintings of the two Tagores, Rabindranath and Abanindranath who were the pioneers of the Bengal School of painting. Her portraits of women resemble works by Rabindranath while the use of 'chiaroscuro' and bright colors reflect the influence of Abanindranath. It was during her stay at Saraya that she painted the Village Scene, In the Ladies' Enclosure and Siesta all of which portray the leisurely rhythms of life in rural India. Siesta and In the Ladies' Enclosure reflect her experimentation with the miniature school of painting while Village Scene reflects influences of the Pahari school of painting. Although acclaimed by art critics Karl Khandalavala in Bombay and Charles Fabri in Lahore as the greatest painter of the century, Amrita's paintings found few buyers. She travelled across India with her paintings but the Nawab Salar Jung of Hyderabad returned them and the Maharaja of Mysore chose Ravi Varma's paintings over hers. Although from a family that was closely tied to the British Raj, Amrita herself was a Congress sympathiser. She was attracted to the poor, distressed and the deprived and her paintings of Indian villagers and women are a meditative reflection of their condition. She was also attracted by Gandhi's philosophy and lifestyle. Nehru was charmed by her beauty and talent and when he went to Gorakhpur in October 1940, he visited her at Saraya. Her paintings were at one stage even considered for use in the Congress propaganda for village reconstruction. However, despite being friends with Nehru, Sher-Gil never drew his portrait, supposedly because the artist thought he was \\"too good looking.\\" Nehru attended her exhibition held in New Delhi in February 1937. Sher-Gil exchanged letters with Nehru for a time, but those letters were burned by her parents when she was away getting married in Budapest. In September 1941, Victor and Amrita moved to Lahore, then in undivided India and a major cultural and artistic centre. She lived and painted at 23 Ganga Ram Mansions, The Mall, Lahore where her studio was on the top floor of the townhouse she inhabited. Amrita was known for her many affairs with both men and women and many of the latter she also painted. Her work Two Women is thought to be a painting of herself and her lover Marie Louise. Some of her later works include Tahitian (1937), Red Brick House (1938), Hill Scene (1938), and The Bride (1940) among others. Her last work was left unfinished by her just prior to her death in December 1941. In 1941, at age 28, just days before the opening of her first major solo show in Lahore, she became seriously ill and slipped into a coma. She later died around midnight on 5 December 1941, leaving behind a large volume of work. The reason for her death has never been ascertained. A failed abortion and subsequent peritonitis have been suggested as possible causes for her death.Truth, Love and a Little Malice, An Autobiography by Khushwant Singh Penguin, 2003. . Her mother accused her doctor husband Victor of having murdered her. The day after her death, Britain declared war on Hungary and Victor was sent to jail as a national enemy. Amrita was cremated on 7 December 1941 at Lahore. Legacy Road named in Delhi after Sher-Gil Sher-Gil's art has influenced generations of Indian artists from Sayed Haider Raza to Arpita Singh and her depiction of the plight of women has made her art a beacon for women at large both in India and abroad. The Government of India has declared her works as National Art Treasures, and most of them are housed in the National Gallery of Modern Art in New Delhi.Amrita Sher-Gil at. Culturalindia.net (30 January 1913). Some of her paintings also hang at the Lahore Museum. A postage stamp depicting her painting 'Hill Women' was released in 1978 by India Post, and the Amrita Shergil Marg is a road in Lutyens' Delhi named after her. Amrita was able to prove to western societies that Indians were able to make fine art. Her work is deemed to be so important to Indian culture that when it is sold in India, the Indian government has stipulated that the art must stay in the country ‚Äì fewer than ten of her works have been sold globally. In 2006, her painting Village Scene sold for 6.9 crores at an auction in New Delhi which was at the time the highest amount ever paid for a painting in India. The Indian cultural center in Budapest is named the Amrita Sher-Gil Cultural Center. Contemporary artists in India have recreated and reinterpreted her works. Besides remaining an inspiration to many a contemporary Indian artists, in 1993, she also became the inspiration behind the Urdu play Tumhari Amrita.Digital encounters The Hindu, 13 August 2006] UNESCO announced 2013, the 100th anniversary of Sher-Gil's birth, to be the international year of Amrita Sher-Gil. Sher-Gil's work is a key theme in the contemporary Indian novel Faking It by Amrita Chowdhury. Aurora Zogoiby, a character in Salman Rushdie's 1995 novel The Moor's Last Sigh, was inspired by Sher-Gil.\\"Amrita Sher-Gil: A Self-Portrait in Letters and Writings\\", ed. Vivan Sundaram, Tulika Books, 2010. Sher-Gil was sometimes known as India's Frida Kahlo because of the \\"revolutionary\\" way she blended Western and traditional art forms. On January 30, 2016, Google celebrated her 103rd birthday with a Google Doodle. In 2018, The New York Times published a belated obituary for her. In 2018, at a Sotheby's auction in Mumbai, Amrita Sher-Gil's painting \\"The Little Girl in Blue\\" was auctioned for a record-breaking 18.69 crores. This painting is a portrait of Amrita's cousin Babit, a resident of Shimla and was painted in 1934, when the subject was 8 years old.

Hair is arranged into layers, with the top layers (those that grow nearer the crown) cut shorter than the layers beneath. This allows the tips of the top layers to blend apparently seamlessly with layers beneath. Popular modern hairstyles involve creating unique styles between the different layers. There can be distinct layering with obvious layers, or blended layering with soft layers. Hair color can also amplify the layering effect that layers give in a certain hair style. Techniques Sectioning and angles The layered hair effect is achieved by taking sections of hair vertically across the head, pulling it perpendicular to the head, and cutting straight across. Sliding haircut: The hair is sectioned in 4 parts, starting with back section and cut radially at 20 deg angle. The transition over the ear is used as a guideline for the front sections. This creates a soft layered end, but predominantly gives the one-length look. Suitable for medium wavy textures. Blended Elevation: The top section (bob section) is cut at 90 degrees while the side sections are cut 180 deg to the length of the top section. The occipital and nape sections are cut at 90 deg. In this form of layering there is an \\"elevated\\" group of layers formed due to shorter top section and then it blends with the softer side and back layers. Not suitable for wavy or curly hair, but for straight or slightly wavy hair.

It is a type of volley gun adapted for ship-to-ship fighting, but was limited in its use because of the powerful recoil and eventually discontinued. Its bizarre appearance and operation has led to it being portrayed in modern fictional works, notably in The Alamo feature film, and the Richard Sharpe series of novels by Bernard Cornwell.  History and design  The weapon was invented by British engineer James Wilson in 1779, and named after Henry Nock, the London-based armaments manufacturer contracted to build the gun. It was intended to be fired from the rigging of Royal Navy warships onto the deck in the event that the ship was boarded by enemy sailors. Theoretically, the simultaneous discharge of seven barrels would have devastating effect on the tightly packed groups of enemy sailors. The volley gun consisted of seven barrels welded together, with small vents drilled through from the central barrel to the other six barrels clustered around it. The central barrel screwed onto a hollow spigot which formed the chamber and was connected to the vent. The gun operated using a standard flintlock mechanism, with the priming gunpowder igniting the central charge via a small vent. When the flash reached the central chamber, all seven charges ignited at once, firing more or less simultaneously. The first models featured rifled barrels, but this made loading a long and cumbersome process, resulting in all following models being manufactured with smoothbore barrels.  Deployment and use  During the early stages of the Napoleonic Wars, 500 Nock guns were purchased by the Royal Navy. However, attempts to use the gun during combat quickly revealed design flaws. The recoil caused by all seven barrels firing at once was more powerful than had been thought, and frequently injured or broke the shoulder of whoever was firing the gun, and in any case made the gun very difficult to control. Furthermore, officers were reluctant to issue the guns during battle out of fear that the flying sparks would set fire to the surrounding rigging and sails. A smaller, lighter version was produced, which shortened the gun's range, but the recoil was still too powerful for sailors to feel comfortable firing it. The few models purchased by the Royal Navy were removed from service in 1804. Examples are available for viewing in the Hollywood Guns exhibit at the National Firearms Museum, the Royal Armouries Museum, and the Charleston Museum (SC).  Popular culture  The Nock gun was brought to modern attention in the 1960 film The Alamo in which one is used by actor Richard Widmark, playing Jim Bowie. The gun used in the film is now in the National Firearms Museum. Nock guns can be seen in realistic period films including Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, and fantasy films Jonah Hex and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. In Bernard Cornwell's series of historical novels featuring Richard Sharpe and, more recently, in the Sharpe TV series, Nock guns are used by the character Patrick Harper. In the video game Gun, the main antagonist, Thomas Magruder, uses a Nock gun during the final boss battle of the game. It later becomes unlocked for the player's use after finishing the game. A modern version was custom-built in an episode of American Guns.

It is the original campus of Proviso Township High Schools District 209. Prior to being split into East and Proviso West High School in 1958, East was known as Proviso Township High School. The school is located at the intersection of Madison Street and First Avenue (which is Illinois Route 171 in that part of Maywood). Proviso East's history in many ways reflects that of some suburban and urban schools in the United States. While initially serving mostly a Caucasian population, as demographic shifts occurred in the post- World War II years, a larger African-American population moved in creating tensions that were widespread in similar communities across the United States. Despite the tensions that occurred in the second half of the twentieth century, the school is known for its extensive list of notable alumni. While perhaps best known for its connection to notable NBA players (Jim Brewer and Glenn \\"Doc\\" Rivers among the more prominent) and other athletes such as Ray Nitschke, the school has seen other alumni achieve well in other areas, such as businesswomen Sheila Johnson, actor Dennis Franz, musician John Prine, and astronaut Eugene Cernan, the last human to walk on the moon. The current principal is Dr. Patrick J. Hardy. History =1911‚ÄîWorld War II= The cornerstone of the school was laid on 21 January 1911 in a ceremony presided over by a local lodge of the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons (part of the newspaper story reported the group to be the Knights Templar). The 22 member class of 1911 graduated from the building, even though the school would not be completed until July. From even its early days, students were no stranger to protest. In May 1913, in retaliation for what students claimed were \\"harsh methods\\", an effigy of the principal, J.E. Witmer, was hung from the telegraph wires in front of the school. After the principal removed the effigy in the early evening, another was hung from the flagpole on top of the school. When signs were found painted on the sidewalk in front of the school the next day, the local marshal took every male in the senior class into custody, ordering them to remove the signs under threat of arrest. The next year, 110 students walked out on strike when the principal refused to grant a holiday for Columbus Day. In October 1915, the school district began the process of selling US$50,000 in bonds for the purpose of expanding the school. In 1929, work began on a new school building. A bond issue was approved by voters in June, though a lawsuit filed by some local taxpayers led to an injunction blocking the bond issue after construction had begun. The new school construction was eventually completed. In November 1936, voters in the district approved a bond issue, in conjunction with funding from the Public Works Administration, for the construction of a fieldhouse. The fieldhouse, including a swimming pool, was completed in 1938. =World War II‚Äì1950s= The outbreak of World War II brought almost immediately bad news to the school. Several of their alumni had been a part of an Illinois National Guard unit (Baker Company, 192nd Tank Battalion). The unit had been activated by the U.S. Army in 1940, and was caught in heavy fighting in the Philippines. Of the 137 members of the company that were killed or captured while defending the islands against the Japanese invasion, 52 of them were alumni. Those not killed were forced to participate in the Bataan Death March. Starting in September 1942, and for every September since, the loss to the community has been commemorated. In the end, 191 alumni were killed in the war. There were several changes to the school as a result of the war. A pre-flight aeronautics class that was open to both young men and women. Ostensibly, the course was designed to reduce training time for future military pilots. Despite being a suburban school, coursework was offered to students who were interested in filling needed jobs in the agriculture sector. The National Youth Administration (NYA) built a workshop on the property to advance vocational education. When the NYA ceased operation in 1943, the school negotiated for the workshop to be turned over to the school, greatly increasing its work space for vocational education. During the summer months, Proviso became a center for training industrial workers necessary for the war effort, offering classes in three shifts, 24 hours a day. In April 1951, the Illinois Education Association meeting held at Proviso East saw a keynote address by Edith S. Sampson, the United States' alternate delegate to the United Nations, and the first African-American woman to represent the U.S. at the United Nations. In 1953, researchers from the University of Chicago recommended that the school begin planning to expand, and school district officials began examining the purchase of land for a new school. By 1955, the school population had grown to over 3,400 students, with an estimated increase to over 6,500 students by 1956. In June 1955, the board accepted a recommendation to purchase a 60 acre site in the town of Hillside, and planned a bond issue for the autumn. Even with the plans for a new school moving forward, the district also approved an expansion of Proviso: a new gymnasium for young women, new music rooms, and new facilities for woodworking classes. In November, the bond issue was approved by a 5900‚Äì626 vote. 1957, the last year Proviso would be the only school in the district, the student population topped out at over 4,800 students. With the new school determined to be Proviso West, the board of education voted to officially change the school's name to Proviso East, effective July 1, 1958. =1960s= In 1963, with a combined student population of over 7,000 between the two schools, further room was needed. East added a total of nine new classrooms by (literally) carving them from a hallway, and the passageway which connected the new and old additions of the school. Proviso East was caught up in a great deal of the racial turmoil that was prevalent in the country in the late 1960s. The 1967‚Äì68 school year saw local tensions become violent. In September 1967, a large fight, started in the school cafeteria when five caucasian girls were selected by school officials as finalists for the school's Homecoming Queen, escalated as students were dismissed. Property damage, some caused by the use of gasoline bombs, and fighting caused more than 100 state troopers to be called in, and a strict curfew to be enforced. Principal Hubert Pitt announced that he would appoint a racially balanced group of students to select a new slate of candidates. Three days later, the situation had not improved, and officials were forced to ask parents to come in and patrol the halls in an attempt to quell the violence. Another fight broke out in the cafeteria. One of the suspected perpetrators was later found out not to be a student at the school leading some to suspect the fight was planned. 31 students were arrested after they later attempted to run from the school. Later, nineteen students were arrested on the street for carrying tire irons. This all came 24 hours after approximately one-half of the school refused to attend classes. The local chapter of the NAACP by this time had urged a boycott of the schools, and drew up a list of 28 demands for school officials. Some students, both African- American and Caucasian, defied the boycott, but only about one-third of students showed up for classes. The boycott was lifted on 1 October, after officials of the school district and the local NAACP reached a compromise. Later that month, another series of fights at the school required the help of state and county police in addition to police from the City of Chicago and surrounding suburbs. The fights stemmed from the suspension of an African- American student who was fighting with a Caucasian student. The next day, over 300 police officers were called in to handle new disturbances that caused classes to be cancelled. Several students in the street were arrested for criminal damage and theft. Teachers threatened to strike if discipline was not restored. Later that day, an arson threat was called in against the school, forcing police to ring the school, and begin keeping outsiders away from the area. The superintendent threatened to assign uniformed officers to each classroom, if necessary. Two days later, classes resumed with 55 off duty police officers inside the school, and expulsion notices were sent out to students seen as \\"persistent trouble makers\\". This led to the expulsion of 35 students. There was another incident in March involving 300 students. The following day, school officials closed Proviso East for two days. While the school was closed, school officials met to review discipline procedures and plan enforcement, which they said would include the use of chemical mace to quell disturbances. The 300 students involved in the most recent fighting were permitted to return, provided they signed a nonviolence pledge, a move that was challenged by the NAACP. The school board then voted to defer the requirement or students to sign the pledges. The 1968‚Äì69 school year saw more racial problems. In mid-September, after a day that saw 15 students hurt during fights in the school, a group of 200 students began throwing rocks and other projectiles at passing cars. Seven were arrested. The incidents resulted in six expulsions and three more students withdrawing. =1970s and 1980s= While the 1970s did see a calmer start than the 1960s ended for Proviso East, there were new issues that had to be faced. Despite the school's large population (still about 4000), the school was forced to adopt austerity measures, which in 1973 involved laying off 52 of the districts' 422 teachers. About 150 students responded by walking out of school, each of which resulted in a suspension. As the 1980s arrived, Proviso East became a school with a population that was now predominantly African-American. This was not the case with its sister school. In 1976, the Illinois State Board of Education had passed rules that required the percentage of minority students within a school be within 15% of the district's minority enrollment. The school district had redrawn the attendance boundaries for the district to comply, however did not successfully desegregate when local housing patterns did not change as anticipated. In 1982, the Illinois Supreme Court invalidated the State Boards orders, claiming they had overstepped their authority in demanding desegregation. =1990s= In 1996 Casey Banas of the Chicago Tribune stated that the school had a poor reputation. In the six county Chicago metropolitan area, as of 1996, Proviso East ranked no. 128 in a ranking of 132 suburban high schools on the American College Test (ACT). That year, Joseph Scoliere, the superintendent of the Forest Park School District 91, stated that of the 91 students graduating from the 8th grade in June 1996, 25 enrolled at Proviso East.Banas, Casey. \\"Proviso East Flunks Test With Many Area Parents.\\" Chicago Tribune. November 15, 1996. Retrieved on February 23, 2014.  Academics  Proviso East's class of 2009 had an average composite ACT score of 15.6. 88.3% of the senior class graduated. Proviso East did not make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) on the Prairie State Achievements Examination, which with the ACT comprises the state assessments used to fulfill the federal No Child Left Behind Act. Neither the school overall, nor any of its four student subgroups met expectations in reading or mathematics. As of 2009, the school is listed as being in its sixth year of academic watch. Athletics Proviso East competes in the West Suburban Conference. The school is also a member of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA), which governs most sports and non- athletic competition in the state. Teams are stylized as the Pirates. Prior to the 1975‚Äì76 school year, Proviso East had been an original member of the Suburban League. With the League's end, Proviso East joined the West Suburban Conference, and has remained there ever since. The school sponsors interscholastic athletic teams for young men and women in: basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis, track & field, and volleyball. Young men may also compete in baseball, football, and wrestling, while young women may compete in softball. The following teams have finished in the top four of their respective IHSA state championship tournament or meet: * Baseball: State Champions (1943‚Äì44, 1952‚Äì53, 1956‚Äì57, 1976‚Äì77) * Basketball (boys): 4th place (2012‚Äì13); 2nd place (1980‚Äì81, 2011‚Äì12); State Champions (1968‚Äì69, 1973‚Äì74, 1990‚Äì91, 1991‚Äì92) * Cross Country (boys): 4th place (1956‚Äì57); State Champions (1954‚Äì55, 1957‚Äì58) * Gymnastics (boys): 3rd place (1956‚Äì57, 1958‚Äì59); 2nd place (1959‚Äì60, 1960‚Äì61, 1964‚Äì65); State Champions (1957‚Äì58, 1961‚Äì62, 1965‚Äì66) * Swimming & Diving (boys): 3rd place (1947‚Äì48, 1948‚Äì49) * Track & Field (boys): 4th place (1974‚Äì75, 1983‚Äì84, 1988‚Äì89); 3rd place (1962‚Äì63, 1975‚Äì76); 2nd place (1932‚Äì33); State Champions (1939‚Äì40, 1979‚Äì80) * Wrestling: 4th place (1988‚Äì89); 3rd place (1940‚Äì41, 1945‚Äì46, 1951‚Äì52, 1963‚Äì64, 1968‚Äì69, 1989‚Äì90); 2nd place (1955‚Äì56, 1962‚Äì63, 1979‚Äì80, 1980‚Äì81); State Champions (1936‚Äì37, 1937‚Äì38, 1938‚Äì39, 1939‚Äì40, 1941‚Äì42, 1942‚Äì43, 1944‚Äì45, 1956‚Äì57, 1985‚Äì86, 1990‚Äì91) The wrestling program, as of the end of the 2008‚Äì09, is tied for the most state championships and most top four finishes in state history. The program holds the state record for most top 10 finishes. The baseball team's four state titles tie it with two other schools for the state record. On October 3, 1934, the school's new stadium was dedicated. While four teams from the school did play, the highlight of the dedication was an exhibition between the Maywood Athletic club football team and the NFL Chicago Cardinals. In March 1941, the fieldhouse at Proviso East hosted a tennis exhibition featuring the Alice Marble Troupe of Professional Tennis Stars. Among the tennis players in attendance to compete were Donald Budge and Bill Tilden. The school was the site for the men's and women's volleyball matches at the 1959 Pan American Games.

Roles and responsibilities  The role of a corporate lawyer is to ensure the legality of commercial transactions, advising corporations on their legal rights and duties, including the duties and responsibilities of corporate officers. In order to do this, they must have knowledge of aspects of contract law, tax law, accounting, securities law, bankruptcy, intellectual property rights, licensing, zoning laws, and the laws specific to the business of the corporations that they work for. In recent years, controversies involving well-known companies such as Walmart and General Motors have highlighted the complex role of corporate lawyers in internal investigations, in which attorney-client privilege could be considered to shelter potential wrongdoing by the company. If a corporate lawyer's internal company clients are not assured of confidentiality, they will be less likely to seek legal advice, but keeping confidences can shelter society's access to vital information. The practice of corporate law is less adversarial than that of trial law. Lawyers for both sides of a commercial transaction are less opponents than facilitators. One lawyer (quoted by Bernstein) characterizes them as \\"the handmaidens of the deal\\". Transactions take place amongst peers. There are rarely wronged parties, underdogs, or inequities in the financial means of the participants. Corporate lawyers structure those transactions, draft documents, review agreements, negotiate deals, and attend meetings. What areas of corporate law a corporate lawyer experiences depend from where the law firm that he/she works for is, geographically, and how large it is. A small-town corporate lawyer in a small firm may deal in many short-term jobs such as drafting wills, divorce settlements, and real estate transactions, whereas a corporate lawyer in a large city firm may spend many months devoted to negotiating a single business transaction. Similarly, different firms may organize their subdivisions in different ways. Not all will include mergers and acquisitions under the umbrella of a corporate law division, for example. Some corporate lawyers become partners in their firms. Others become in-house counsel for corporations. Others migrate to other professions such as investment banking and teaching law. Some publications read by those in the profession include Global Legal Studies, Lawyers Weekly, and the National Law Journal. Salary The salary of a corporate lawyer can vary widely: those employed by major international law firms (\\"BigLaw\\" firms) earn starting salaries of US$ 180,000 / year, which rise every year with experience (this amount excludes any additional bonus payments). Depending on the geographical location, the starting salary may be closer to US$ 160,000 / year if the market is secondary. Attorneys employed at smaller firms tend to earn smaller salaries.

Nature study attempted to reconcile scientific investigation with spiritual, personal experiences gained from interaction with the natural world. Led by progressive educators and naturalists such as Anna Botsford Comstock, Liberty Hyde Bailey, Louis Agassiz, William Gould Vinal, and Wilbur S. Jackman, nature study changed the way science was taught in schools by emphasizing learning from tangible objects, something that was embodied by the movement's mantra: \\"study nature, not books\\". The movement popularized scientific study outside of the classroom as well, and has proven highly influential for figures involved in the modern environmental movement, such as Aldo Leopold and Rachel Carson.Armitage, p. 13 Background By the mid-19th century, a growing concern for the state of the environment began to take shape. In 1864, American diplomat George Perkins Marsh published the groundbreaking book Man and Nature. Highlighting people's responsibility to the natural world, the work marked the beginning of the conservation movement.Krech, p. 441 Before the 1890s, the idea of nature study existed, but the \\"efforts had been sporadic and piecemeal\\".Kohlstedt, \\"Nature, Not Books\\", p. 327 Naturalist Louis Agassiz wanted to capture \\"learners in studying the natural world\\". His students, who were influenced by this philosophy, went on to provide the nature study knowledge in public schools.Kohlstedt, \\"Nature, Not Books\\", p. 325 It was Agassiz who coined the phrase, \\"Study nature, not books.\\" Definitions Nature study can be described as \\"conceiving of the movement as a loose coalition of communities composed of individuals, societies, and institutions able to find some common ground in the study and appreciation of the natural world\\".Tolley, p. 128 In \\"Leaflet I: What Is Nature-Study?\\" from a 1904 collection nature study lessons, Liberty Hyde Bailey presented the following description of nature study: > NATURE-STUDY, as a process, is seeing the things that one looks at, and the > drawing of proper conclusions from what one sees. Its purpose is to educate > the child in terms of his environment, to the end that his life may be > fuller and richer. Nature-study is not the study of a science, as of botany, > entomology, geology, and the like. That is, it takes the things at hand and > endeavors to understand them, without reference primarily to the systematic > order or relationships of objects. It is informal, as are the objects which > one sees. It is entirely divorced from mere definitions, or from formal > explanations in books. It is therefore supremely natural. It trains the eye > and the mind to see and to comprehend the common things of life; and the > result is not directly the acquiring of science but the establishing of a > living sympathy with everything that is. Anna Comstock defined the idea extensively in her book, Handbook of Nature Study: \\"Nature Study is for the comprehension of the Individual life of the bird, insect or plant that is nearest at hand.\\"Comstock, p. 5 Comstock continued that nature study aided \\"both discernment and in expression of things as they are\\".Comstock, p. 1 The movement came at a time when society was concerned with the future of the next generationKohlstedt, \\"Nature, Not Books\\", pp. ?-? and with nature conservation itself, and because of this was met with high regard and high expectations. Though many efforts had come before 1890 by some naturalists and scientists to teach and expand the movement, the nature-study movement really did not gain momentum with the public until the late 19th century. By 1925, the subject had found a place in the curriculum of almost every school district in the United States. \\"Study nature, not books\\" Many scientists, teachers, and leaders throughout the United States agreed on the value of nature study, and the subject became an important part of how the natural world was examined in many areas of the country by the early 20th century.Kohlstedt, \\"Nature, Not Books\\", p. 324 Scientists gave public support to the philosophy and added to the creation of a curriculum and courses. The movement was particularly popular in the Northeast, the West, and the Midwest. The South also found some use for the idea of natural science in their agriculture schools, as well as at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama (now Tuskegee University) and Hampton Institute in Virginia (now Hampton University).Kohlstedt, \\"Nature, Not Books\\", pp. 351‚Äì352 Nature Study could be found in both urbanized, highly populated cities and in rural school systems because of the involvement of scientists in designing and implementing curriculum.Kohlstedt, \\"Nature, Not Books\\", p. 326 For example, Wilbur Jackman created an outline of nature study with \\"life and its phenomena\\" which examined how the study of plants and animals would consist of zoology and botany (under biology), physics, chemistry, meteorology, astronomy, geography, geology, and mineralogy.Kohlstedt, \\"Nature, Not Books\\", p. 334 Lucretia Crocker along with women's clubs and other help in the Boston area, created a \\"Teachers' School of Science\\" in Back Bay at the New Museum of the Boston society. Along with an Ellen Swallow Richards, Crocker created a mineralogy course for teachers. Teacher found such education in the Boston area because of area scientist that would teach their courses.Kohlstedt, \\"Nature, Not Books\\", p. 328 The American Nature Study Society was founded in 1908, and still exists today.Tolley, p. 129 The society was an important aspect as well in helping to bring about the Nature-Study movement. Anna Botsford Comstock is one of the society' past presidents. It is considered to be America's oldest organization for environment.The American Nature Study Society. EnviroLink Network. Retrieved on June 9, 2010. Anna Botsford Comstock studied and worked as the head of the Department of Nature Study at Cornell University with her husband, John Henry Comstock.Herrick and Smith, caption of p. 18 Cornell University was considered to be a major hub for the Nature Study movement. She wrote the Handbook of Nature Study, which includes sections on how to teach the subject and how to teach the courses to children, and also includes sections from different species of animals and plants to even the skies. Education for children Sciences were expanding in colleges and universities, and scientists felt \\"that students needed more and better preparation in secondary and primary schools\\".Kohlstedt, \\"Nature, Not Books\\", p. 329 Not only was the curriculum of schools evolving, but also was the system of education itself. Populations were rising in big urban areas like New York and Chicago, and there was legislation to require students to spend required numbers of hours and days per year in the school system. With a growing population due to immigration and other reasons, young people could be taught useful skills for life and academia in order to \\"share fundamental civic values and enlarged view of their world\\".Kohlstedt, \\"Nature, Not Books\\", p. 331 The nature study became the way younger students learned of their natural world.Kohlstedt, \\"Nature, Not Books\\", p. 351 This also came at a time when legislation was being passed for conservation in the country, which helped gather support from parents and educators in the country. Anna Botsford Comstock, stated in her book Handbook of Nature Study, \\"nature-study cultivates the child's imagination, since there are so many wonderful and true stories that he may read with his own eyes, which affect his imagination as much as does fairy lore, at the same time nature study cultivates in him a perception and a regard for what is true, and the power to express it...Nature study gives the child practical and helpful knowledge. It makes him familiar with nature's ways and forces, so that he is not so helpless in the presence of natural misfortune and disasters.\\" Comstock also felt that the nature study did not begin with books, but through the observations of life and form from the first naturalists.Comstock, p. 5‚Äì6 The point of the system being to \\"give pupils an outlook over all the forms of life and their relation one to another\\". Because of the importance placed on the new generation, the surrounding public watched the schools carefully with high expectations of the students in the late 19th century.Kohlstedt, \\"Nature, Not Books\\", p. 330 A study in Kim Tolley's the Science Education of American Girls showed that of 127 public school systems, 49% offered Nature-study in all grades, 25% offered in at least six grades, 11% in at least four grades, 5% in three grades or lower, and 10% did not offer it at all in 1925.Tolley, p. 135 Women in the movement Women played many roles in this movement within American society. Some were able to find supervisory jobs, or jobs as professor in natural history at school districts, or institutions of higher learning. Some women helped to create the movement itself, like Anna Botsford Comstock, and also teachers were able to \\"[implement] nature study to varying degrees in their classrooms and occasionally modified the curriculum created by male professionals so that it favored the life sciences\\". Over the four years from 1915‚Äì16 to 1919‚Äì20 in the state of Wisconsin, the percentage of women high school biology teachers increased from 50% to 67%. The number of women physics teachers increased from 3% in 1915‚Äì16 to 7% in 1919‚Äì20.Tolley, p. 121 The nature study movement gave a new outlook to the education of young women in the United States. In the later 20th century, opinions started to change about the movement, and it declined. Some male critics saw it as \\"romantic\\" or \\"sentimental\\". This created a gender issue that was forcibly imposed on the nature-study movement. By the beginning of the 20th century, many young women were attracted to the natural history movement.Tolley, p. 95 The Science Education of American Girls by Kim Tolley gives an explanation of high schools in America for females. \\"Higher schools for females served as important centers for the dissemination of the nineteenth-century ideology of separate spheres, institutions commonly located in small towns and in rural, rather than urban, areas. The ideology prevailed in antebellum southern institutions serving elite girls who never expected to work for wages outside the home, in northern schools that explicitly south to prepare teachers for the nation's growing common schools, and in Catholic academies on the western front.\\"Tolley, p. 94 Others, such as Susanna Moodie, and her daughter Agnes Chamberlin who made nature studies to support her family, and Catharine Parr Traill investigated nature to describe the new territories where they found themselves in nineteenth century Canada.

The club was constituted in 1887, and played its first game in 1888. Celtic play home games at Celtic Park, having moved there from their original ground in 1892. The club quickly established itself as a dominant force in Scottish football, winning six successive league titles during the first decade of the 20th century. A fierce rivalry developed with Rangers, and the two clubs became known as the Old Firm. Under manager Jock Stein, in 1967 Celtic became the first British team to win the European Cup, which had previously been the preserve of Italian, Portuguese and Spanish clubs. Celtic is one of only two clubs to have won the trophy with a team composed entirely of players from the club's home country; all of the players in the side were born within 30 miles of Celtic Park in Glasgow. Celtic won nine successive league titles from 1966‚Äì1974, then a world record. The club continued to enjoy domestic success throughout the 70s and 80s, despite the rise of the so-called New Firm of Aberdeen and Dundee United. Celtic won the league and cup double in 1988, their Centenary Year. The team's fortunes went into decline in the early 1990s, with the family dynasties that had run Celtic since its formation struggling to cope with the increasing commercialisation of football. In March 1994, with Celtic facing bankruptcy, Canadian-based businessman Fergus McCann took control of the club. Early years (1887‚Äì1897) A team photo from the early days of the club, c. 1889, before the adoption of the now-famous hooped jerseys Celtic Football Club was formally constituted at a meeting in St. Mary's church hall in East Rose Street (now Forbes Street), Calton, Glasgow, by Irish Marist Brother Walfrid on 6 November 1887, with the purpose of alleviating poverty in the East End of Glasgow by raising money for the charity Walfrid had instituted, the Poor Children's Dinner Table. Walfrid's move to establish the club as a means of fund-raising was largely inspired by the example of Hibernian who were formed out of the immigrant Irish population a few years earlier in Edinburgh. Walfrid's own suggestion of the name 'Celtic' (still pronounced Seltik, the standard pronunciation in the 19th century), was intended to reflect the club's Irish and Scottish roots, and was adopted at the same meeting. The club has the official nickname, \\"The Bhoys\\". However, according to the Celtic press office, the newly established club was known to many as \\"the bold boys\\". A postcard from the early 20th century that pictured the team, and read \\"The Bould Bhoys\\", is the first known example of the unique spelling. The extra 'h' imitates the spelling system of Gaelic, where the letter B is often accompanied by the letter H. Brother Walfrid, founder of Celtic F.C. On 28 May 1888, Celtic played their first official match against Rangers and won 5‚Äì2 in what was described as a \\"friendly encounter\\". Neil McCallum scored Celtic's first ever goal. The derby between the two rivals became inescapably linked with the slogan: the Old Firm. The actual origins of the term are unclear; some believe it relates to a newspaper comment made that the players in their first meeting got on so well that they appeared to be \\"old firm friends\\", whilst others believe it to be a cynical observation of the commercial benefits that the two clubs enjoyed as their rivalry grew. Celtic's first kit consisted of a white shirt with a green collar, black shorts, and emerald green socks. The original club crest was a simple green cross on a red oval background. In 1889 the club adopted a strip of white and green vertical stripes before finally taking up the now famous green and white hoops in 1903. While Brother Walfrid had only charitable motives for the club, others saw huge financial potential. John Glass, a Scottish builder with Donegal family connections and Pat Welsh, a tailor who had left Ireland 20 years previously, observed the coming of professionalism in England in 1885 and correctly assumed that Scotland would follow. In August 1888, without the knowledge of Brother Walfrid or the club committee, Glass signed eight of Hibs‚Äô best players, having offered them cash inducements. The consequences for Hibernian were catastrophic due to the loss of so many players. They went into immediate decline and went out business by the end of the season, although quickly reformed and managed to re-establish themselves in Scottish football. In 1889 Celtic reached the final of the Scottish Cup, this was their first season in the competition, but lost 2‚Äì1 to Third Lanark in the final. They also reached the final of the local Glasgow North Eastern Cup and beat Cowlairs 6‚Äì1 in the final.Glasgow North-eastern Football Association Final Cup Tie, The Scotsman, 13 May 1889 (via The Celtic Wiki) Celtic again reached the final of the Scottish Cup in 1892, but this time were victorious after defeating Queen's Park 5‚Äì1 in the final which was held at Rangers' stadium, Ibrox Park. Sandy McMahon and John Campbell both scored twice in the game, helping Celtic win their first major honour. Several months later the club moved to its new ground, Celtic Park, and in the following season won the Scottish Football League for the first ever time. On 26 October 1895, Celtic set the League record for the highest home score when they beat Dundee 11‚Äì0. Willie Maley years (1897‚Äì1940) In 1897 the club became a Private limited company and Willie Maley was appointed as the first 'secretary-manager'. Having been a club that initially relied on buying in experienced players, Maley instead concentrated on developing young talent mainly from the Junior ranks. This proved a success as Celtic went on to dominate Scottish football in the first decade of the 20th century, winning the Scottish League Championship six times in a row between 1905 and 1910. In both 1907 and 1908 Celtic also won the Scottish Cup, this was the first time a Scottish club had ever won the Double. During this time, players such as Alec McNair, Jimmy Quinn, 'Sunny' Jim Young, Peter Somers, Alec Bennett, Davie Hamilton, Jimmy McMenemy and goalkeeper Davey Adams provided the backbone of Celtic's team. Scottish League champions and winners of the Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup, Scottish Cup and Glasgow Cup The turn of the decade saw several key players either retire or leave Celtic for other clubs. This coincided with a slight decline in the club's fortunes as Rangers racked up three consecutive league titles between 1911 and 1913. Celtic however continued to enjoy success in the Scottish Cup, with Cup Final wins over Hamilton in 1911, Clyde in 1912 and Hibernian in 1914. 'Sunny' Jim Young was at the peak of his powers and captain of the side, whilst the slightly built Patsy Gallacher belied his frail appearance with exhilarating skill on the wing. With the emergence of Gallacher along with others such as Peter Johnstone and Andy McAtee complementing long-time stalwarts such as Young, McNair and McMenemy, Celtic regained the League Championship at the end of April 1914 to complete their third League and Cup Double. The Ferencv√°ros Vase (also known as The Budapest Cup) was won by Celtic on a European tour in 1914. Celtic played Burnley in Budapest as Ferencv√°ros had agreed to award a trophy to the winner. However, the match was a bad tempered affair and ended in a draw, with both teams refusing to play extra time. A replay couldn't be organised in Budapest as Celtic were travelling back to Glasgow. After winning the coin toss to play the game at home, Burnley played host to Celtic. The visitors won 2‚Äì0 and part of the gate money was sent to the Hungarian Charity Fund, however Celtic were not presented with the trophy, which had been sold to raise funds for the war effort. Seventy four years later, in 1988, Celtic were celebrating their centenary and Ferencv√°ros remembered they 'owed' the club a trophy. In the absence of the original trophy they brought a decorative white porcelain vase, fashioned in the traditional shape of a football cup, to Glasgow. It was presented at Celtic's centenary championship winning match against Dundee in April 1988. During World War I, Celtic won the league four times in a row. During this run of league championships, Celtic went 62 matches unbeaten from 20 November 1915 until 14 April 1917, a record in British football that stood for 100 years, until broken by Celtic themselves in November 2017. However, Celtic's time during World War I was mixed, although they enjoyed great success on the pitch. Football was not as important; attendances fell, player's salaries were reduced and there was increased pressure to complete the fixture list. On one occasion in 1916, during their 62 match unbeaten run, Celtic had to play two matches on the same day against Raith Rovers and Motherwell, and won both 6‚Äì0 and 3‚Äì1 respectively. Recruitment drives were also held at football matches and on one occasion an exhibition of trench warfare was held at Celtic Park. Several Celtic players also fought during the war; reserve player William Angus won the Victoria Cross for his bravery in the field and fan-favourite Peter Johnstone, who had made over 200 appearances for Celtic, died at the Battle of Arras in 1917. The period during the war saw the death of Brother Walfrid, who died on 17 April 1915 at 74 years of age. He was buried in a Marist graveyard in Dumfries. Maley referred to Brother Walfrid's death in his annual report to shareholders, stating he had been \\"... the last of the leading founders of the Celtic club..\\" and that his work for Celtic had been \\"a labour of love\\". After the Great War, and into the 1920s, Rangers took over from Celtic as the dominant force in Scottish football. Rangers won 8 league titles to Celtic's 2 during the 1920s. Celtic, however, continued to find success in the Scottish Cup, winning it three times in the 20s. Celtic's Scottish Cup win in 1925 proved to be particularly memorable. The semi-final in front of a crowd of over 100,000 at Hampden saw Celtic beat Rangers 5‚Äì0. Celtic met Dundee in the final on 11 April 1925. With the match nearing full-time and Dundee leading 1‚Äì0, Patsy Gallacher dribbled forward towards the Dundee goal. A Dundee defender tackled Gallacher as he neared the goalmouth, Gallacher stumbled but managed to somersault with the ball gripped between his feet, over the goal- line and into the back of the net. Willie Maley commented afterwards that Gallacher's goal was \\"one of these incidents that had to be seen to be appreciated.\\" Celtic went on to score another goal and won 2‚Äì1. Jimmy McGrory (right) in action for Celtic during the 1930s. He is the record goal-scorer in British football, with a career total of 550 goals The mid-1920s saw the emergence of Jimmy McGrory as one of the most prolific goalscorers in Scottish football history. Over a sixteen-year playing career, he scored 550 goals (including 16 goals for Clydebank during a season on loan in 1923‚Äì24), a British goal-scoring record to this day. His 57 League and Cup goals in season 1926‚Äì27 remains a record at Celtic. In January 1928, McGrory set the League record for most league goals in a match, when he scored eight of Celtic's goals in a 9‚Äì0 win over Dunfermline. In 1928 Arsenal made strenuous attempts to sign McGrory, offering both player and club huge (for the time) amounts of money. Celtic were more than willing to sell, but McGrory did not want to leave Celtic and thus remained. Later McGrory quipped, \\"McGrory of Arsenal just never sounded as good as McGrory of Celtic\\". In September 1931 the club was struck by tragedy when goalkeeper John Thomson was accidentally killed during an Old Firm encounter. Thomson dived in bravely at the feet of Rangers player Sam English, suffering a skull fracture and died in hospital that evening. Thomson was only 22 years old but had amassed over 200 competitive appearances for Celtic since making his first-team debut as an 18-year-old in 1927. In his ultimately short career, the young goalkeeper had gained the respect and admiration of his colleagues and opponents, and was considered to be one of the finest 'keepers in the country. He was later referred to as the 'Prince of Goalkeepers' in Hugh Taylor's book The Masters of Scottish Football (1967), a label which has since stuck. An estimated 30,000 mourners attended Thomson's funeral at Cardenden in Fife. Sam English, himself a young rising star in Scottish football, was completely blameless for the accident but moved to England a year later before finally retiring in 1938, still aged only 28. English referred to his football career after Thomson's death as \\"seven years of joyless sport\\". Maley's era also saw the arrival of the first player from the Indian sub-continent player at a major European club when he signed Mohammed Abdul Salim in 1936. Despite playing in his bare feet, Salim scored one goal in a 5‚Äì1 win over Hamilton AcciesBreck, A. Alan Breck's Book of Scottish Football. Scottish Daily Express, 1937, cited in See also, and created three goals for other Celtic players in a 7‚Äì1 win over Galston.Scottish Daily Express, 29 August 1936, cited in Majumdar, B. and Bandyopadhyay, K. A Social History Of Indian Football: Striving To Score. Routledge, 2006, p. 68. Salim was praised by the media for his performances in the two games (both friendlies) he played for Celtic. He thus became the first player from the Indian sub-continent to play for a European club. After a few months in Scotland, and without making any competitive appearances, Salim returned to India where he saw out the remainder of his football career. Celtic's performances improved in the mid-1930s with the emergence of winger Jimmy Delaney and forwards Johnny Crum, Willie Buchan and John Divers complementing the now veteran Jimmy McGrory. Celtic won the league title in 1936, their first championship since 1926, and enjoyed away wins at Ibrox and Motherwell's Fir Park for the first time since 1921 and 1926 respectively. McGrory scored a club record 50 league goals that season. The following year Celtic played Aberdeen in the 1937 Scottish Cup Final, which was watched by a crowd of 146,433 at Hampden Park. Celtic won 2‚Äì1 and the attendance remains a record for a club match in Europe. Season 1937‚Äì38 was Celtic's golden jubilee season. Celtic's traditional New Year league fixture against Rangers was played on 1 January 1938 at Celtic Park in front of 83,500 supporters, a record attendance at the ground. Celtic went on to win 3‚Äì0, and was their first New Year derby win in 10 years. The club won their 19th league title that season, clinching it on 23 April 1938 with a 3‚Äì1 win over St Mirren. On 10 June 1938, Celtic defeated Everton of England 1‚Äì0 at Ibrox Park to claim the Empire Exhibition Trophy; Johnny Crum scoring the decisive goal. In January 1940, Willie Maley's retirement was announced. He was 71 years old and had served the club in varying roles for nearly 52 years, initially as a player and then as secretary-manager. World War II (1939‚Äì1945) Former player Jimmy McStay became manager of the club in February 1940. He spent over five years in this role, although due to the Second World War no official competitive league football took place during this time. Many footballers signed up to fight in the war and as a result many teams were depleted, and fielded guest players instead. The Scottish Football League and Scottish Cup were suspended and in their place regional league competitions were set up. Celtic did not do particularly well during the war years, not helped by their reluctance to field guest players. They did manage to win the Glasgow Cup in 1941 and the Glasgow Charity Cup in 1943. Several very promising young players did emerge at Celtic during the war; goalkeeper Willie Miller, forward John McPhail and right-half Bobby Evans. The Victory in Europe Cup was a one-off football tournament won by Celtic on 9 May 1945. To celebrate Victory in Europe Day in 1945, the Glasgow Charity Cup committee presented the Victory in Europe Cup to be awarded to the winners of a charity cup final. Rangers were invited to participate but declined as they had a forthcoming cup tie against Motherwell. This allowed Queen's Park to step in and play Celtic. The game finished 0‚Äì0 and Celtic won only by the margin of a corner kick. In July 1945, McStay was asked by the Celtic Board to resign, which he did reluctantly. He did however later return to Celtic to work as chief scout. Jimmy McGrory years (1945‚Äì1965) Ex-player and captain Jimmy McGrory returned to Celtic in the summer of 1945 as manager. A further significant change occurred in the Boardroom with the death in 1947 of Celtic chairman Tom White who had been in failing health for several years. Robert Kelly, who had been a director at the club since 1931 and was a stockbroker by profession, became the new Chairman of Celtic in March 1947. For the next 18 years, Kelly would be the dominant personality at Celtic Park; imposing his will in the running of the club at all levels and having direct involvement in team selection, to the extent that many queried how much say McGrory really had in team matters. Celtic toiled for the first few post-war years under McGrory, and narrowly avoided relegation in 1948. In response, Celtic appointed Jimmy Hogan during the summer as a coach. He had previously worked throughout Europe, notably Hungary, and spent six years as the English FA's coach. Hogan only spent two years at Parkhead but is credited with the improvement in Celtic's football in the early 1950s, and his coaching ideas are also believed to have later inspired Jock Stein. In April 1951 a John McPhail goal saw Celtic defeat Motherwell 1‚Äì0 in the Scottish Cup Final for the club's first major trophy since the war. Two years later, Celtic defeated Arsenal, Manchester United and Hibernian to win the Coronation Cup, a one-off tournament held in May 1953 to commemorate the coronation of Elizabeth II. In 1954 Celtic won their first league and cup double for forty years, and their first league title since 1938. Centre-half Jock Stein, a low-key signing from Llanelli, had been appointed stand-in captain in 1952 due to injury to Sean Fallon. Stein kept his position as team captain even after Fallon's return from injury, and his presence imposed a sense of purpose within the team that had previously been lacking. Celtic finished five points ahead of Hearts in the league and had the best defensive record in the division (only 29 goals conceded). The Scottish Cup Final was contested between Celtic and Aberdeen. A keenly contested match was won by a Sean Fallon goal after excellent play from Willie Fernie. The 1950s saw several players emerge as mainstays in the Celtic side, Bobby Evans, Bertie Peacock, Bobby Collins and perhaps most memorably, Charlie Tully. Tully was a charismatic performer who combined audacious dribbling with outright showboating and razor sharp wit. In a Scottish Cup tie in 1953 at Falkirk, Tully scored direct from a corner. The 'goal' was disallowed by the referee as the ball had been placed slightly outwith the arc. Tully re-took the corner and swung the ball directly into the net again. Tully became hugely popular with the Celtic support, and 'Tullymania' resulted in Glasgow cafes selling 'Tully ice cream', bars serving 'Tully cocktails' and drapers producing 'Tully ties'. Bobby Collins in contrast to Tully was a hard uncompromising player but nevertheless a very creative midfielder. He made his debut at 18 years old and became a fixture in the Celtic side of the 1950s, playing in the Scottish Cup winning team of 1951, League Championship side of 1953‚Äì54 and League Cup winning sides of 1956 and 1957. Collins was a very popular figure with the Celtic support who nicknamed the 5'3\\" midfielder \\"The Wee Barra\\". He scored 116 goals in 320 appearances for Celtic in major competitions. However, more than most he seemed to suffer from the club's eccentric team selections of that time; being inexplicably dropped from the 1954 Cup Final against Aberdeen (Celtic won 2‚Äì1) and again a year later in the Cup Final replay against lowly Clyde, with the unfancied underdogs winning 1‚Äì0 in one of Scotland's more surprising cup final results. Bobby Collins bio (The Celtic Wiki) Bobby Collins articles (The Celtic Wiki) On 19 October 1957, Celtic trounced Rangers a record 7‚Äì1 in the final of the Scottish League Cup at Hampden Park in Glasgow, retaining the trophy they had won for only the first time the previous year. The scoreline remains a record win in a British domestic cup final. The victory is still sung of by fans ‚Äì Hampden in the sun to the tune of the Harry Belafonte song Island in the Sun. Billy McPhail grabbed a hat- trick after Sammy Wilson and Neilly Mochan had the Celts 2‚Äì0 up at the break. Mochan then added to his tally in the second period before Willie Fernie slotted away a penalty right at the end. The years that followed saw Celtic struggle and, despite the emergence of hugely promising players such as Billy McNeill, Paddy Crerand, Bertie Auld and Jimmy Johnstone, Celtic won no more trophies under McGrory. Within the space of just over a year in the late 1950s, both Jock Stein and Sean Fallon had to retire from playing due to injury. Both men became involved in the coaching of the reserve side, with Stein eventually leaving Celtic to become manager of Dunfermline Athletic in 1960. Fallon remained at Celtic and became Chief Coach working under McGrory. Other key players left Celtic around this time as well; John McPhail retired in 1956, Bobby Collins was sold to Everton in 1958, Charlie Tully returned to Ireland in 1959 and Bobby Evans joined Chelsea in 1960. In the post-war period numbered shirts slowly came into use throughout Scotland, before becoming compulsory in 1960. By this time Celtic were the last club in Britain to adopt the use of numbers on the team strip to identify players. The traditionalist and idealistic Celtic chairman, Robert Kelly, baulked at the prospect of the famous green and white hoops being disfigured, and as such Celtic wore their numbers on the players shorts. The early 1960s saw Celtic make their first forays into European club competition. Celtic's third place in the league the previous season saw them qualify for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1962. Celtic were drawn against Spanish side Valencia in the first round. The tie, as with most European ties, was played over two games at each team's home ground. The first 'leg' in Spain saw Celtic beaten 4‚Äì2, although a modicum of pride was restored in the return leg in Glasgow which finished 2‚Äì2. The following season, 1963‚Äì64, saw Celtic return to European competition, this time in the European Cup Winners Cup. Celtic belied their recent mediocre domestic achievements in Scotland by reaching the semi-final of the tournament, eliminating FC Basel, Dinamo Zagreb and Slovan Bratislava on the way. The first leg of the semi-final against MTK Budapest took place at Celtic Park, and goals from Jimmy Johnstone and Stevie Chalmers gave Celtic an impressive 3‚Äì0 win. Celtic were defeated 4‚Äì0 in the return leg in Hungary and go out on aggregate. In Scotland, Celtic continued to struggle. By January 1965 Celtic were once again out of contention for the league and had just been beaten in the New Year game by Rangers, drawn with Clyde and lost to Dundee United. The Daily Mail on 12 January 1965 commented on Celtic, \\"They are being left behind by provincial clubs with a fraction of their resources. They are being left so far behind by Rangers that it is no longer a race.\\" On that same day, the Celtic Board held a special meeting to discuss changes to the management. Jock Stein (1965‚Äì1978) Jock Stein succeeded McGrory in 1965. A former player and team captain, Stein gained most of his fame as Celtic's manager, and is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest football managers in the history of the game. Stein is also famous for guiding Celtic to nine straight Scottish League wins from 1966 to 1974, equalling a world record held at the time by MTK Budapest and CSKA Sofia. Jock Stein was formally announced as the new manager on 31 January 1965, although he did not take up his duties until March to allow Hibernian, who he was managing, time to find his replacement. Jimmy McGrory became the club's Public Relations Officer, a post he would retain until his retirement. Sean Fallon became Assistant Manager. On Stein's arrival in March 1965, Celtic were struggling in the league and continued to have mixed results; Stein winning his first game 6‚Äì0 at Airdrie, but then losing 4‚Äì2 to Hibs and 6‚Äì2 to Falkirk. Celtic had progressed to the semi-finals of the 1964‚Äì65 Scottish Cup prior to Stein's arrival in March. Celtic came from behind twice against Motherwell in the semi-final to force 2‚Äì2 draw, then won the replay 3‚Äì0. This set up a final against Dunfermline on 24 April 1965. Celtic again came from behind twice before Billy McNeill scored the winning goal in the final minute to clinch a 3‚Äì2 win, giving Celtic their first trophy since 1957. In August 1965, Celtic became the first British football club to produce its own newspaper, The Celtic View. The paper started as a four-page weekly publication and was the brainchild of Jack McGinn who was working in the circulation department of Beaverbrook Newspapers. McGinn himself edited the paper for the first few years, with circulation initially reaching around 26,000 copies. Season 1965‚Äì66 was Stein's first full season as manager at Celtic. He won his second trophy on 23 October 1965 as two converted penalty-kicks by John Hughes saw Celtic beat Rangers 2‚Äì1 in the League Cup final. Celtic clinched their first league title since 1954 on 7 May 1966 with a 1‚Äì0 win over Motherwell at Fir Park, finishing two points ahead of Rangers. As a sign of the progress under Stein, Celtic scored 30 more league goals in 1965‚Äì66 than they had done the previous year. Celtic also impressed in European competition, reaching the semi-finals of the European Cup Winner's Cup by knocking out Go Ahead Deventer, AGF Aarhus and Dynamo Kiev. Celtic lost 1‚Äì2 on aggregate to Liverpool in the semi-final, although a last minute Bobby Lennox 'goal' was controversially disallowed in the second leg at Anfield which would have seen Celtic win the tie via the recently implemented 'away goals' rule. 1967 was Celtic's annus mirabilis. The club won every competition they entered, scoring a world record total of 196 goals: the Scottish League, the Scottish Cup, the Scottish League Cup, the Glasgow Cup, and the European Cup. The League Cup was the first trophy to be won that season, courtesy of a 1‚Äì0 win on 29 October 1966 over Rangers in the final. The Glasgow Cup was secured a week later when Celtic beat Partick Thistle 4‚Äì0. Celtic's progression to the Scottish Cup was relatively straightforward aside from being taken to replay in the semi-final by Clyde. On 6 April 1967 Celtic met Aberdeen in the final, and two Willie Wallace goals eased Celtic to a 2‚Äì0 win. Celtic's league campaign proved to be a more tightly contested affair as, despite only losing twice, with two games remaining Rangers were still in contention. Celtic's penultimate league fixture was against Rangers at Ibrox, with a draw required to clinch the title. A brace by Jimmy Johnstone gave Celtic a 2‚Äì2 draw and the championship. Celtic's European Cup campaign in 1966‚Äì67 was their first ever participation in Europe's premier club tournament. FC Zurich and Nantes were comfortably disposed of in the first two rounds (5‚Äì0 and 6‚Äì2 on aggregate respectively). The quarter final in March 1967 pitched Celtic against the Yugoslav champions, Vojvodina. The Yugoslav side won the first leg in Novi Sad 1‚Äì0. The return match in Glasgow proved to be a fraught affair. The Yugoslavs defended resolutely and threatened on the counter-attack, but Celtic levelled the tie on aggregate in the second half with a goal by Stevie Chalmers. Celtic pressed for a winner, but Vojvodina defended well and the tie looked like a play-off in neutral Brussels would be required. However, in the final minute Billy McNeill headed in a Charlie Gallacher cross to see Celtic progress to the semi-final. Celtic now faced Czechoslovakian side, Dukla Prague. This time the first leg of the tie took place in Glasgow, with Celtic winning 3‚Äì1 courtesy of goals from Jimmy Johnstone and a Willie Wallace brace. In respect of his opponents' quality, Stein set up Celtic to be ultra-defensive for the second leg and forsake ‚Äì temporarily ‚Äì their philosophy of attacking football. The tactics worked as Celtic secured a 0‚Äì0 draw to put them in the final. However, Stein was almost apologetic about the manner of Celtic's success in that game and he felt uncomfortable in later years discussing the matter. The final saw Celtic play Inter Milan, with the match taking place at the Est√°dio Nacional on the outskirts of Lisbon on 25 May 1967. Celtic fell a goal behind after only seven minutes, Jim Craig adjudged to have fouled Renato Cappellini in the penalty box and Sandro Mazzola converting the resultant penalty. Celtic swept into constant attack after that but found Inter goalkeeper Giuliano Sarti in outstanding form. With 63 minutes played, after incessant pressure, Celtic finally equalised when Tommy Gemmell scored with a powerful 25-yard shot. The balance of play remained the same with Inter defending deeply against sustained Celtic attacking. With about five minutes remaining, a long-range shot from Bobby Murdoch was diverted by Stevie Chalmers past a wrong-footed Sarti. It proved to be the winning goal and thus Celtic became the first British team, and the first from outside Spain, Portugal or Italy to win the competition. Jock Stein commented after the match, Celtic are one of only two clubs to have won the trophy with a team composed entirely of players from the club's home country; all of the players in the side were born within 30 miles of Celtic Park in Glasgow, and they subsequently became known as the 'Lisbon Lions'. The entire east stand at Celtic Park is dedicated to The Lisbon Lions, and the west stand to Jock Stein. The sight of captain Billy McNeill holding aloft the European Cup in the Est√°dio Nacional has become one of the iconic images of Scottish football. A statue outside Celtic Park showing Billy McNeill with the European Cup was unveiled in December 2015. Two weeks later, on 7 June 1967, Celtic played Real Madrid in a testimonial match for the now retired Alfredo Di Stefano. In front of over 100,000 fans at the Bernab√©u Stadium, the sides engaged in a keenly fought contest which saw Bertie Auld and Real Madrid's Amancio sent off. Di Stefano played for the first 15 minutes, but it was Jimmy Johnstone who stole the show with an exhilarating performance that had even the Spanish supporters chanting \\"Ol√©!\\" throughout the game in appreciation of his skill. Johnstone capped an outstanding performance by playing the pass to Bobby Lennox for the only goal in a 1‚Äì0 win for Celtic. Celtic players raising a flag of Uruguay at Estadio Centenario before the 1967 Intercontinental Cup playoff v. Racing Club The following season Celtic played Copa Libertadores champions Racing Club of Argentina in the Intercontinental Cup series during October and November 1967. The first game took place at Hampden Park, with Celtic winning 1‚Äì0 through a headed goal by Billy McNeill. The match however was marred by incessant foul play and spitting by the Argentinians. The return match in Buenos Aires was a torrid affair; goalkeeper Ronnie Simpson was struck by a missile thrown by the Racing Club fans as the teams prepared for kick-off and had to be replaced by stand- in, John Fallon. A Tommy Gemmell penalty put Celtic ahead in the first half but Racing Club rallied and goals from Norberto Raffo and Juan Carlos C√°rdenas either side of half-time clinched a 2‚Äì1 for the South American champions. The series of games then went to a decider, played in Montevideo, Uruguay. The game was a shambles, exacerbated by Racing Club's continual cynical fouling and spitting and the incompetence of the Paraguayan referee who was clearly out of his depth. Riot police had to intervene on the pitch several times as six players were sent off; four from Celtic and two from Racing Club. Bertie Auld was the fourth Celtic player to be sent off, but refused to leave the field, whilst Tommy Gemmell kicked a Racing Club player in the genitals in one of numerous incidents missed by the referee. Racing Club scored the only goal of the game in the second half, winning the game 1‚Äì0 and the Intercontinental Cup. Celtic were criticised for their conduct in Montevideo, but the provocation in all three games was extreme and Jock Stein commented afterwards \\"I would not bring a team to South America again for all the money in the world.\\" Jock Stein in an Amsterdam hotel, ahead of a European Cup tie against Ajax (1971) Celtic put the trauma of their ill-fated Intercontinental Cup involvement behind them to win their third consecutive league title in 1967‚Äì68, again by a narrow margin over Rangers.Celtic Win in Last Ten Seconds ‚Äì David Potter on The Year After the Year Before, The Celtic Star, 15 November 2019 They also won the League Cup, beating Dundee 5‚Äì3 in the final. Season 1968‚Äì69 saw Celtic won another clean-sweep of the three major domestic trophies (League, Scottish Cup and League Cup) ‚Äì a 'treble' ‚Äì which included a 10‚Äì0 win over Hamilton Accies in the quarter-final of the League Cup and an emphatic 4‚Äì0 win over Rangers in the Scottish Cup Final. This was only the club's second 'treble', and they would not repeat the feat again for another 32 years. Celtic reached the European Cup Final again in 1970, a run which included a 3‚Äì0 win at Parkhead over Portuguese side Benfica in the second round. The semi-finals saw Celtic drawn against English champions Leeds Utd. This was the first occasion that the reigning champions of England and Scotland had played each other in a fully competitive European tie. The first leg took place at Elland Road, with a goal in the opening minute from George Connelly giving Celtic a 1‚Äì0 lead to take back to Glasgow for the second leg. The return match was played at Hampden Park on 15 April 1970 in front of a 136,505 crowd, a record attendance for a competitive European club tie that stands to this day. In 14 minutes, Billy Bremner scored from long range to level the tie on aggregate. Celtic kept their composure though, and equalised two minutes into the second half though a John Hughes header. Jimmy Johnstone had a particularly outstanding match and his mazy run set up Bobby Murdoch to score with a powerful shot, sealing a 2‚Äì1 win for Celtic on the night and their progression to the final. The final took place on 6 May 1970 at the San Siro in Milan against Dutch side Feyenoord. Celtic were overwhelming favourites, but despite Tommy Gemmell opening the scoring after 30 minutes, they were comprehensively outplayed by the Dutch side and slumped to a 2‚Äì1 defeat after extra time. The early 1970s saw the emergence from the reserves of a group of young players known as the 'Quality Street Gang'. This group included Danny McGrain, Kenny Dalglish, Davie Hay, Lou Macari and George Connelly; all of whom won major honours at Celtic and were capped by Scotland. This emerging group of players helped Celtic reach the semi-finals of the European Cup on a further two occasions, losing on penalties to Inter Milan in 1972 and 2‚Äì0 on aggregate to Spanish side Atl√©tico Madrid in 1974. The tie against the Spaniards was particularly acrimonious. Atl√©tico were managed by Juan Carlos Lorenzo who had coached Argentina at the 1966 World Cup where his players were branded \\"animals\\" by Alf Ramsey. In the first leg at Parkhead, the Atl√©tico players continually kicked and hacked their opponents. Three Atl√©tico players were sent off, but their incessant foul play made it impossible, indeed physically dangerous, for Celtic to play their normal game. The match finished 0‚Äì0, and the sour evening was completed with a punch-up between the two sets of players as they made their way up the tunnel at full- time. In the buildup for the second leg in Spain, Jimmy Johnstone received a death threat over the hotel phone and a hate campaign from the Spanish media prevented the Celtic players from relaxing or training effectively. Atl√©tico won the match 2‚Äì0, winning the tie on aggregate and progressing to the final against Bayern Munich where the Spanish side lost 4‚Äì0 after a replay. John McKenna On 6 May 1972, Celtic's Dixie Deans became the first player since 1904 to score a hat-trick in a Scottish Cup final. Celtic defeated Hibernian 6‚Äì1, with Celtic's third goal (and Deans' second) amongst the most famous of Scottish Cup Final goals. Deans intercepted a mis-directed Hibernian clearance, then rounded their goalkeeper to advance on goal along the by-line; he manoeuvred past a defender then rounded the goalkeeper again before shooting into the net. Deans then celebrated the goal with a spectacular somersault that was frequently re-played on television for years afterwards. Celtic clinched their ninth successive league title at the end of season 1973‚Äì74, equalling the then world record held by MTK Budapest and CSKA Sofia. Celtic failed to win the league the following year, but continued to rack up trophies, beating Airdrie 3‚Äì1 on 3 May 1975 in the Scottish Cup final. The match was captain Billy McNeill's 822nd competitive appearance for the club and immediately prior to kick-off he informed his team-mates that he was now retiring. Nicknamed 'Cesar' by his colleagues, McNeill's career spanned 17 years and saw the centre-half become an integral part of Celtic during what is considered the club's halycon period. McNeill had arrived at Celtic in the late 1950s during Jock Stein's time as reserve team coach, and became Stein's right-hand man on the field upon his return as manager in 1965. He was very much the leader of the team, and years later in interview admitted that there were the occasional \\"verbal and physical\\" battles among the players; \\"Not too often. But we set a standard and, if someone was not meeting it, then, well...\\" The 1975 Scottish Cup was McNeill's 23rd major winner's medal as a player. Stein was seriously injured in a car accident in the summer of 1975 and spent the next year recuperating. On his return for season 1976‚Äì77, he signed Hibernian's long-serving captain, defender Pat Stanton. Later on in the season, Stein signed attacking midfielder Alfie Conn from Tottenham Hotspur. It was a transfer that surprised many, given Conn had played for Rangers in the early 70s, winning the European Cup Winners Cup for them in 1972 and scoring in a 3‚Äì2 win over Celtic in the 1973 Scottish Cup Final. Conn became the first footballer post-World War II to play for both Rangers and Celtic. Celtic, helped considerably by Stanton's organisation of the defence, went on to win their tenth league and cup double; Celtic finished nine points ahead of Rangers in the league and beat them 1‚Äì0 in the cup final courtesy of an Andy Lynch penalty. During this period only Kenny Dalglish and Danny McGrain remained of the so-called Quality Street Kids, but other very promising players such as midfielder Tommy Burns, defender Roy Aitken and striker George McCluskey were emerging from the reserves. Aitken proved to be particularly versatile, being able to play effectively in midfield as well as defence. He also found himself in a bizarre situation in 1976 when had to be 'adopted' by Celtic in order to be allowed to enter East Germany to play a European tie. Aitken was still only 17 years old and the authorities there did not consider him to be an adult. The following season, Stein's last as manager of Celtic, was a huge disappointment however. Celtic struggled to cope with the departure of Dalglish to Liverpool and long-term injuries to McGrain and Stanton. The club slumped to fifth place in the league, were knocked out of the Scottish Cup by lower-league Kilmarnock and were beaten 2‚Äì1 by Rangers in the League Cup Final. In May 1978, Billy McNeill was appointed the new manager of Celtic, with former team-mate and fellow Lisbon Lion John Clark as his assistant. Jock Stein remained at Celtic for a further few months. There are conflicting reports as to whether Stein was actually offered a seat on the Board of Directors or not, but either way the specific role intended for him was to run the club's Football Pools. Stein did not relish that role, and preferring to remain in football with a 'hands-on' role, in August 1978 he left Celtic Park to take up the vacant managerial post at Leeds United. Jock Stein is widely acknowledged as one of the most important influences on the development of Celtic Football Club since Willie Maley. Stein restored Celtic to a position of dominance in Scotland that they had not enjoyed since before World War I, and made the club a respected force throughout Europe. Stein added a new dimension to the position of 'manager' in Scotland, and his man-management style and grasp of the psychological side of the game was years ahead of its time. Stein was hugely respected by his peers and a massive influence on the next generation of managers who would follow in his footsteps, in particular Sir Alex Ferguson at Aberdeen and later Manchester United. Billy McNeill and Davie Hay (1978‚Äì1991) Billy McNeill (nicknamed \\"Cesar\\") the former player and captain of The Lisbon Lions, took over as manager in August 1978. The return from injury of Danny McGrain and shrewd signings such as winger Davie Provan and midfielder Murdo MacLeod helped McNeill strengthen a Celtic side that had finished fifth in the league previous season. In May 1979 Celtic's final league fixture was an Old Firm fixture against Rangers at Parkhead. A win would clinch the 1978‚Äì79 league title for Celtic, but any other result would leave Rangers as favourites for the league as they had two additional games to play. Celtic attacked from the start but trailed 1‚Äì0 at half-time through an Alex MacDonald goal for Rangers. Johnny Doyle was then sent-off in the second half, leaving Celtic a man down as well as a goal down. Celtic though, responded in exhilarating style through goals from Roy Aitken and George McCluskey to go 2‚Äì1 ahead. Celtic's lead only lasted a couple of minutes, Bobby Russell equalising with a fine strike. As the game neared the end, and with Celtic attacking relentlessly, a McCluskey cross was parried by Rangers goalkeeper Peter McCloy against one of his own defenders, Colin Jackson, and then rebounded back into the goal to put Celtic 3‚Äì2 ahead. In the final minute Murdo MacLeod put the matter beyond doubt when he hammered home a powerful 20 yard strike to secure a 4‚Äì2 win on the night and clinch the title in the most dramatic of circumstances. Billy McNeill in September 1982The following season Celtic reached the quarter-finals of the European Cup. Celtic were drawn against Real Madrid, and goals from George McCluskey and Johnny Doyle gave Celtic a 2‚Äì0 win in the first leg at Parkhead. Two weeks later at the Bernabeu Stadium, Celtic were beaten 3‚Äì0 and went out on aggregate. That season, Celtic held an eight-point lead in the league at one stage, but a strong emerging Aberdeen side caught up on them and pipped them to the title. Celtic did win the Scottish Cup, a George McCluskey goal giving Celtic a 1‚Äì0 win after extra-time in a tight encounter with Rangers in May 1980. The aftermath of the game however is now notorious for the riot that took place between the rival fans that day. Crowds of Celtic fans raced onto the pitch to celebrate at full-time. A section of Rangers fans quickly invaded the pitch in response and confronted the Celtic fans. A pitched battle then ensued between the two groups of supporters, with both clubs later fined ¬£20,000. McNeill led Celtic to another two league titles in 1981 and 1982, and oversaw the emergence of another crop of promising young players such as Charlie Nicholas, Paul McStay and Irish goalkeeper Pat Bonner. Nicholas by 1983 was one of Scottish football's most exciting prospects. He had formed a deadly goalscoring partnership with Frank McGarvey and in season 1982‚Äì83 he scored 48 goals in the major competitions. These goals included an excellent goal in a 2‚Äì1 win over Ajax in the European Cup, the opening goal in Celtic's 2‚Äì1 League Cup Final over Rangers in December 1982, and a brace in the final league game of the season at Ibrox, Celtic coming back to defeat Rangers 4‚Äì2 after trailing 0‚Äì2 at half-time. Nicholas' form attracted the attention of several big-name English clubs, and at the end of the season he moved to Arsenal in an ¬£750,000 deal. Paul McStay made his league debut at 17 years of age, scoring in a 3‚Äì1 win over Aberdeen on 30 January 1982. The McStay family had a strong presence at Celtic; Paul's great-uncles Willie and Jimmy McStay both captained Celtic in the inter-war years, with Jimmy managing Celtic during the Second World War. Paul's older brother, Willie McStay, also played regularly for Celtic in the early to mid-1980s. Paul McStay went on to become a fixture in the first team, and his skillful performances saw him recognised at international level. In 1983 he became the first Scotland player to be capped at youth, Under 21 and Senior level in the space of 12 months. McNeill had by this stage won a trophy in each of his seasons as manager, despite the rise of the so-called 'New Firm' of Aberdeen and Dundee United in the 1980s. However, an inability to gel with the then Chairman Desmond White, and dispute over the transfer funds from the sale of Charlie Nicholas to Arsenal saw relations between the manager and the Celtic Board deteriorate. Matters came to a head when McNeill attempted to negotiate a contract and pay rise. It was not an unreasonable request given McNeill was not only lower paid than Jim McLean (Dundee United), Alex Ferguson (Aberdeen) and John Greig (Rangers), but he was also lower paid than the managers of Motherwell and St Johnstone. Desmond White issued a press release stating \\"Mr McNeill's request for a contact and wages increase have been unanimously rejected by the Celtic board of directors.\\" Rebuffed and publicly humiliated by the Board, McNeill's first spell as manager came to an abrupt end, and he left the club in June 1983 to join Manchester City. Another former player David Hay took over from McNeill in July 1983, but finished runner-up in each of the domestic tournaments in his first season as manager; finishing 2nd in the league to Aberdeen, runners- up to Rangers in the League Cup and losing 1‚Äì2 after extra time to Aberdeen in an acrimonious Scottish Cup Final which saw Celtic's Roy Aitken sent off. Despite the lack of trophies, new striker Brian McClair who had been signed in the summer of 1983 from Motherwell impressed by scoring 32 goals. The following year proved even more stressful for Celtic as they found themselves embroiled in a series of controversial matches in the European Cup Winner's Cup against Rapid Vienna. Celtic lost the first leg 1‚Äì3 in Austria, but despite rough-house tactics from the Austrians, it was only Celtic's Alan McInally who found himself red-carded. The return match at Parkhead was an even more bad-tempered affair as Celtic raced to a 3‚Äì0 lead in spite of Rapid Vienna's foul play. The match erupted near the end when Tommy Burns was punched by a Rapid Vienna player. In the ensuing chaos, coins and at least one bottle were thrown onto the pitch by Celtic fans. None appeared to hit anybody, but one of the Rapid Vienna players was carried off the pitch with his head swathed in bandages. The match finished 3‚Äì0, with Celtic winning the tie 4‚Äì3 on aggregate. However, Rapid Vienna appealed ‚Äì citing the alleged injury to their player. The initial appeal was dismissed by UEFA, but a second appeal from Rapid Vienna was upheld and a replay was ordered to take place at least 150 kilometres (90 miles) from Glasgow. The Celtic board acquiesced to this decision in spite of considered opinion that Celtic should withdraw from the tournament on principle. As such, the match at Parkhead was declared void and a third match was held in Manchester at Old Trafford. Celtic lost 0‚Äì1, and two Celtic fans assaulted Rapid Vienna players. UEFA fined Celtic and ordered their next home European tie to take place behind closed doors. This was an episode that highlighted both UEFA corruption and the incompetence of a spineless Celtic board. The same season saw Celtic taking up shirt sponsorship for the first time, with Fife-based double glazing firm CR Smith having their logo emblazoned on the front of the team jersey. The new sponsored strips were worn for the first time on 29 September 1984 in an away league match against Dundee at Dens Park. May 1985 saw David Hay win his first trophy as manager, as Celtic overturned a 1‚Äì0 deficit in the centenary final of the Scottish Cup to defeat Dundee United 2‚Äì1. Trailing to Dundee United, Hay make a tactical change in the second half by pushing Roy Aitken forward from central defence into midfield. The move proved a success as Aitken's presence in midfield began to galvanise Celtic. A virtuoso free-kick from Davie Provan in 77 minutes equalised the earlier goal from Dundee Utd's Stuart Beedie, only the third occasion that a goal had been scored direct from a free-kick in a Scottish Cup Final. Five minutes from the end, a driving run and cross from down the right by Aitken set up a diving header from Frank McGarvey to win the game for Celtic. The following year, Celtic clinched the league title on the last day of the season under the most improbable of circumstances. In order to win the title, Celtic were required to win their final game by a margin of three goals or more against St Mirren at Love Street, and hope Hearts would lose to Dundee at Dens Park. Celtic raced into a 4‚Äì0 lead by half-time, whilst the game at Dens Park remained goal-less. Celtic scored a fifth early in the second half. In 83 minutes Albert Kidd scored for Dundee against Hearts. Celtic fans celebrated wildly at Love Street, but an equaliser from Hearts could still have seen the title go to Tynecastle. Five minutes later however, Kidd added a second for Dundee, seeing Hearts lose their match 2‚Äì0, with Celtic's 5‚Äì0 win sealing the league championship title via goal difference. The following season saw Rangers spending heavily under new player-manager Graeme Souness. Celtic started the season brightly but soon squandered a seven-point lead, with Rangers winning their first title since 1978. Celtic lost 1‚Äì2 to Rangers in the League Cup Final, with manager Davie Hay so exasperated by the controversial penalty for Rangers which resulted in their winning goal, that he stated afterwards that if it was up to him, \\"I would apply for Celtic to join the English league tomorrow.\\" Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup by Hearts in February 1987, and despite an outstanding season from striker Brian McClair in which he scored 41 goals, Celtic finished the season trophyless. Davie Hay was sacked on 28 May 1987, and Billy McNeill returned as manager. When Billy McNeill returned to manage the club in 1987, he oversaw significant change in playing personnel over the summer. Strikers Brian McClair, Mo Johnston and Alan McInally had left, as well as midfielder Murdo MacLeod. Winger Davie Provan retired due to ill-health, veteran defender and captain Danny McGrain had been given a free transfer whilst Irish international centre-half Mick McCarthy had arrived from Manchester City, signed by Davie Hay a few weeks before his sacking. McNeill signed three players over the summer; right-back Chris Morris from Sheffield Wednesday, goalscoring midfielder Billy Stark from Aberdeen and striker Andy Walker from Motherwell. As the season progressed, Frank McAvennie arrived from West Ham and young forward Joe Miller ‚Äì a very promising prospect ‚Äì was signed from Aberdeen. This new-look Celtic side, captained by Roy Aitken, quickly gelled and embarked on a 31-game unbeaten run, culminating in a historic League Championship and Scottish Cup double win in the club's centenary season. Walker and McAvennie forged a successful partnership up front whilst Paul McStay enjoyed his finest season, winning both the SPFA and Scottish Football Writers player of the year awards. Celtic clinched the league title on 23 April 1988 with a 3‚Äì0 win over Dundee in front of what appeared to be an overcrowded Celtic Park. The latter stages of the Scottish Cup provided plenty drama for fans. In the semi-final against Hearts, Celtic trailed 0‚Äì1 going into the final three minutes and looked devoid of inspiration until Hearts' goalkeeper Henry Smith fumbled a cross which was thumped into the goal by Mark McGhee to level the match. A replay looked certain until in injury time, Smith under pressure from McGhee failed to deal with another ball into the box, with Andy Walker scoring the winner from close range. The Cup Final, on 14 May 1987, saw Dundee United take the lead early in the second half. Frank McAvennie equalised in 75 minutes, heading an Anton Rogan cross past United goalkeeper Billy Thomson. With about a minute remaining, McAvennie scored again to win the Cup for Celtic. However, the success generated by McNeill's return was followed by a dismal performance in the league the following season, along with a 5‚Äì1 defeat by Rangers at Ibrox in the opening Old Firm clash. Celtic did retain the Scottish Cup in 1989 though, beating Rangers 1‚Äì0 through a Joe Miller strike. The 1989‚Äì90 season was a very disappointing one. Celtic's new Polish striker Dariusz Dziekanowski scored four goals at Parkhead in the second leg of a first round European Cup Winners Cup encounter with Partizan Belgrade, but the team still went out of the competition under the away goals rule. The team's league campaign was dreadful and they eventually finished fifth. Celtic did reach the Scottish Cup Final in 1990, but after the match finished 0‚Äì0 (after extra time) Aberdeen beat them 9‚Äì8 on penalties. During that season, Celtic captain Roy Aitken left to join Newcastle United, with Paul McStay taking over the captaincy of the side. In May 1990 former Lord Provost of Glasgow, Michael Kelly, and property developer Brian Dempsey joined the Celtic board; teaming up with Chairman Jack McGinn and existing directors Chris White, Kevin Kelly, James Farrell and Tom Grant. Dempsey did not last long, a dispute about a proposed relocation from Parkhead to Robroyston resulted in him being voted off the board five months later. This would be the beginning of several years of public acrimony within the Celtic board. Season 1990‚Äì91 saw Celtic's league fortunes fall away fairly quickly, despite their centre-back Paul Elliott being voted Players' Player of the Year. They did reach the Skol Cup Final in October only to be beaten in extra time by Rangers. In December 1990, Celtic appointed their first ever Chief Executive, Terry Cassidy. Cassidy had an impressive background but his abrasive nature did not go down well in Scottish football. On the pitch, Celtic gained a modicum of revenge over Rangers for their earlier Skol Cup Final defeat in a 1991 Scottish Cup quarter-final tie with their rivals, beating them 2‚Äì0 through Gerry Creaney and Dariusz Wdowczyk goals. It was a wild St. Patrick's Day encounter which saw three Rangers players (Terry Hurlock, Mark Walters and Mark Hateley) and one Celtic player (Peter Grant) get the red card. However, the joy was short-lived as Motherwell knocked them out of the semi-final 4‚Äì2. Another lacklustre season had left McNeill in an almost hopeless position and his credibility was further undermined when Chief Executive Terry Cassidy made public a strategy for sacking McNeill should the need arise. It was no surprise when the beleaguered McNeill left the club for the last time at the end of the 1990‚Äì91 season. Liam Brady and Lou Macari (1991‚Äì1994) Liam Brady took charge of Celtic shortly after McNeill departed and became only the eighth manager in over 100 years, but the first to have not previously been a player at the club. Despite his credentials as a player with Arsenal, Juventus and the Republic of Ireland, he failed to bring any measure of success to the club in a managerial capacity. Brady made several moves in the transfer market during his first season. Striker Tony Cascarino was signed for a club record ¬£1.1 million from Aston Villa in the summer of 1991. Cascarino was not a success at Celtic and was moved on to Chelsea in a swap deal for Scotland defender Tom Boyd in February 1992. In an attempt to bolster Celtic's defence, Liverpool defender Gary Gillespie was signed in August 1991 for ¬£925,000. However, Gillespie struggled to adapt to the more robust style of play in Scotland, so Brady signed Middlesbrough's Tony Mowbray a few months later in a ¬£1 million deal to add steel to a light-weight central defence. Unfortunately both Gillespie and Mowbray's spells at Celtic were blighted by injuries and the pair did not often play together. On 23 October 1991, in the first leg of an away UEFA Cup encounter against Swiss side Neuch√¢tel Xamax, Celtic lost 5‚Äì1 as Egyptian striker Hossam Hassan ran amok against the Celtic defence by scoring four goals, one of the worst European defeats in the club's history. In the return leg at Celtic Park, they could only manage a 1‚Äì0 victory and crashed out of the tournament 5‚Äì2 on aggregate. Celtic came third in the league in May 1992 behind Rangers and Hearts, lost to Airdrie on penalties in a League Cup quarter-final tie after a 0‚Äì0 draw, and were knocked out of the Scottish Cup by 10-man Rangers in the semi-finals. Celtic were also toiling off the field. The club failed to secure a shirt sponsor for season 1992‚Äì93, and for the first time since the early 1980s Celtic took to the field in 'unblemished' hoops. Peversely, despite the loss of marketing revenue, sales of the new unsponsored replica top increased dramatically. Chief Executive Terry Cassidy continued to stir controversy, and was finally sacked on 26 October 1992, with club announcing they had no immediate plans to fill the post. Brady made several more personnel changes to the Celtic side for 1992‚Äì93, selling defenders Derek Whyte and Chris Morris whilst bringing in forwards Stuart Slater (for a then record fee of ¬£1.5m) and Andy Payton from England, and right-back Rudi Vata, the first Albanian to play in British football. Celtic's domestic form proved to be no better than the previous season, losing 1‚Äì0 to Aberdeen in the semi-final of the League Cup, a disappointing 2‚Äì0 defeat at Falkirk in the Scottish Cup, and a fourth-place finish in the league. Europe provided a brief respite for Brady, Celtic recovering from a 2‚Äì0 first leg defeat away at Cologne in the UEFA Cup to win the return match in Glasgow 3‚Äì0, midfielder John Collins scoring the decisive third goal seven minutes from time. Collins had been signed from Hibernian by Billy McNeill in the summer of 1990, but after a mediocre first season became one of the few players to genuinely flourish during Liam Brady's tenure as manager. The summer of 1993 saw Scottish-born Canadian business man, Fergus McCann emerge as one of several individuals and consortia attempting to take over from the existing Board at Celtic. Along with various fan groups also dedicated to removing the Board at Celtic, these groups and individuals came to be known collectively as the 'Rebels'. Celtic regained shirt sponsorship for season 1993‚Äì94, with CR Smith returning as shirt sponsors in a four-year deal. On the pitch, Celtic were soon toiling again and Brady departed in October 1993 after a league defeat at St Johnstone. Lou Macari was appointed the new manager of Celtic on 27 October 1993. Celtic's form didn't improve and a miserable 4‚Äì2 defeat by Rangers in the New Year fixture at Parkhead left them languishing in the league. Macari made several moves in the transfer market ‚Äì none of them particularly successful. Gerry Creaney, one of the few consistent goalscorers at Celtic at that time, was played out of position on the right-wing for several weeks before being sold to Portsmouth for ¬£600,000. Striker Willie Falconer was signed from Sheffield United, right-back Lee Martin and goalkeeper Carl Muggleton came north from England, and in what is considered one of Macari's poorest moves, Andy Payton moved to Barnsley in a part-exchange deal for journeyman striker Wayne Biggins. An early Scottish Cup exit in January 1994 at Motherwell sealed another dismal season for Celtic. However, events off the field were gathering momentum. Two consortia, one headed by Fergus McCann and the other by Gerald Weisfield, were vying to take over Celtic. The Celtic Board were, however, pushing forward plans for the building of a new stadium at Cambuslang. On 25 February 1994, Celtic held a press conference where they announced that funding was in place for the new stadium via Swiss merchant bank, Gefinor. However, later that day Gefinor denied that funding had been agreed for the project, and that same evening the proposed plans were being ridiculed by the Scottish television and radio media. The days that followed saw any remaining credibility that the Celtic Board had vanish. The Bank of Scotland summoned the Celtic Board on 3 March 1994 and informed them that unless a guarantee of ¬£1m was found within 24 hours then they would begin the process of winding up the club affairs. The following day, Fergus McCann became the new owner of Celtic with a new team of directors appointed. Brian Dempsey, former director and heavily involved in the campaign for change, pledged ¬£1 million of his own money to assist the McCann takeover, and stated \\"the rebels have won\\".

The disorder has been historically documented as affecting only infants, young children, and people with cognitive disabilities (the prevalence is as high as 10% in institutionalized patients with various mental disabilities). It is increasingly being diagnosed in a greater number of otherwise healthy adolescents and adults, though there is a lack of awareness of the condition by doctors, patients and the general public. Rumination syndrome presents itself in a variety of ways, with especially high contrast existing between the presentation of the typical adult sufferer without a mental disability and the presentation of an infant and/or mentally impaired sufferer. Like related gastrointestinal disorders, rumination can adversely affect normal functioning and the social lives of individuals. It has been linked with depression. Little comprehensive data regarding rumination syndrome in otherwise healthy individuals exists because most sufferers are private about their illness and are often misdiagnosed due to the number of symptoms and the clinical similarities between rumination syndrome and other disorders of the stomach and esophagus, such as gastroparesis and bulimia nervosa. These symptoms include the acid-induced erosion of the esophagus and enamel, halitosis, malnutrition, severe weight loss and an unquenchable appetite. Individuals may begin regurgitating within a minute following ingestion, and the full cycle of ingestion and regurgitation can mimic the binging and purging of bulimia. Diagnosis of rumination syndrome is non-invasive and based on a history of the individual. Treatment is promising, with upwards of 85% of individuals responding positively to treatment, including infants and the mentally disabled.  Signs and symptoms  While the number and severity of symptoms vary among individuals, repetitive regurgitation of undigested food (known as rumination) after the start of a meal is always present. In some individuals, the regurgitation is small, occurring over a long period of time following ingestion, and can be rechewed and swallowed. In others, the amount can be bilious and short lasting, and must be expelled. While some only experience symptoms following some meals, most experience episodes following any ingestion, from a single bite to a large meal. However, some long-term patients will find a select couple of food or drink items that do not trigger a response. Unlike typical vomiting, the regurgitation is typically described as effortless and unforced. There is seldom nausea preceding the expulsion, and the undigested food lacks the bitter taste and odour of stomach acid and bile. Symptoms can begin to manifest at any point from the ingestion of the meal to 120 minutes thereafter. However, the more common range is between 30 seconds to 1 hour after the completion of a meal. Symptoms tend to cease when the ruminated contents become acidic. Abdominal pain (38.1%), lack of fecal production or constipation (21.1%), nausea (17.0%), diarrhea (8.2%), bloating (4.1%), and dental decay (3.4%) are also described as common symptoms in day- to-day life. These symptoms are not necessarily prevalent during regurgitation episodes, and can happen at any time. Weight loss is often observed (42.2%) at an average loss of 9.6 kilograms, and is more common in cases where the disorder has gone undiagnosed for a longer period of time, though this may be expected of the nutrition deficiencies that often accompany the disorder as a consequence of its symptoms. Depression has also been linked with rumination syndrome, though its effects on rumination syndrome are unknown. Acid erosion of the teeth can be a feature of rumination, as can halitosis (bad breath).  Causes  The cause of rumination syndrome is unknown. However, studies have drawn a correlation between hypothesized causes and the history of patients with the disorder. In infants and the cognitively impaired, the disease has normally been attributed to over-stimulation and under-stimulation from parents and caregivers, causing the individual to seek self-gratification and self-stimulus due to the lack or abundance of external stimuli. The disorder has also commonly been attributed to a bout of illness, a period of stress in the individual's recent past, and to changes in medication. In adults and adolescents, hypothesized causes generally fall into one of either category: habit-induced, and trauma-induced. Habit-induced individuals generally have a history of bulimia nervosa or of intentional regurgitation (magicians and professional regurgitators, for example), which though initially self-induced, forms a subconscious habit that can continue to manifest itself outside the control of the affected individual. Trauma-induced individuals describe an emotional or physical injury (such as recent surgery, psychological distress, concussions, deaths in the family, etc.), which preceded the onset of rumination, often by several months.  Pathophysiology  Rumination syndrome is a poorly understood disorder, and a number of theories have speculated the mechanisms that cause the regurgitation, which is a unique symptom to this disorder. While no theory has gained a consensus, some are more notable and widely published than others. The most widely documented mechanism is that the ingestion of food causes gastric distention, which is followed by abdominal compression and the simultaneous relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This creates a common cavity between the stomach and the oropharynx that allows the partially digested material to return to the mouth. There are several offered explanations for the sudden relaxation of the LES. Among these explanations is that it is a learned voluntary relaxation, which is common in those with or having had bulimia. While this relaxation may be voluntary, the overall process of rumination is still generally involuntary. Relaxation due to intra-abdominal pressure is another proposed explanation, which would make abdominal compression the primary mechanism. The third is an adaptation of the belch reflex, which is the most commonly described mechanism. The swallowing of air immediately prior to regurgitation causes the activation of the belching reflex that triggers the relaxation of the LES. Patients often describe a feeling similar to the onset of a belch preceding rumination.  Diagnosis  Rumination syndrome is diagnosed based on a complete history of the individual. Costly and invasive studies such as gastroduodenal manometry and esophageal Ph testing are unnecessary and will often aid in misdiagnosis. Based on typical observed features, several criteria have been suggested for diagnosing rumination syndrome. The primary symptom, the regurgitation of recently ingested food, must be consistent, occurring for at least six weeks of the past twelve months. The regurgitation must begin within 30 minutes of the completion of a meal. Patients may either chew the regurgitated matter or expel it. The symptoms must stop within 90 minutes, or when the regurgitated matter becomes acidic. The symptoms must not be the result of a mechanical obstruction, and should not respond to the standard treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease. In adults, the diagnosis is supported by the absence of classical or structural diseases of the gastrointestinal system. Supportive criteria include a regurgitant that does not taste sour or acidic, is generally odourless, is effortless, or at most preceded by a belching sensation, that there is no retching preceding the regurgitation, and that the act is not associated with nausea or heartburn. Patients visit an average of five physicians over 2.75 years before being correctly diagnosed with rumination syndrome. = Differential diagnosis = Rumination syndrome in adults is a complicated disorder whose symptoms can mimic those of several other gastroesophogeal disorders and diseases. Bulimia nervosa and gastroparesis are especially prevalent among the misdiagnoses of rumination. Bulimia nervosa, among adults and especially adolescents, is by far the most common misdiagnosis patients will hear during their experiences with rumination syndrome. This is due to the similarities in symptoms to an outside observer--\\"vomiting\\" following food intake--which, in long-term patients, may include ingesting copious amounts to offset malnutrition, and a lack of willingness to expose their condition and its symptoms. While it has been suggested that there is a connection between rumination and bulimia, unlike bulimia, rumination is not self-inflicted. Adults and adolescents with rumination syndrome are generally well aware of their gradually increasing malnutrition, but are unable to control the reflex. In contrast, those with bulimia intentionally induce vomiting, and seldom re-swallow food. Gastroparesis is another common misdiagnosis. Like rumination syndrome, patients with gastroparesis often bring up food following the ingestion of a meal. Unlike rumination, gastroparesis causes vomiting (in contrast to regurgitation) of food, which is not being digested further, from the stomach. This vomiting occurs several hours after a meal is ingested, preceded by nausea and retching, and has the bitter or sour taste typical of vomit. = Classification = Rumination syndrome is a condition which affects the functioning of the stomach and esophagus, also known as a functional gastroduodenal disorder. In patients that have a history of eating disorders, Rumination syndrome is grouped alongside eating disorders such as bulimia and pica, which are themselves grouped under non-psychotic mental disorder. In most healthy adolescents and adults who have no mental disability, Rumination syndrome is considered a motility disorder instead of an eating disorder, because the patients tend to have had no control over its occurrence and have had no history of eating disorders.  Treatment and prognosis  There is presently no known cure for rumination. Proton pump inhibitors and other medications have been used to little or no effect. Treatment is different for infants and the mentally handicapped than for adults and adolescents of normal intelligence. Among infants and the mentally handicapped, behavioral and mild aversion training has been shown to cause improvement in most cases. Aversion training involves associating the ruminating behavior with negative results, and rewarding good behavior and eating. Placing a sour or bitter taste on the tongue when the individual begins the movements or breathing patterns typical of his or her ruminating behavior is the generally accepted method for aversion training, although some older studies advocate the use of pinching. In patients of normal intelligence, rumination is not an intentional behavior and is habitually reversed using diaphragmatic breathing to counter the urge to regurgitate. Alongside reassurance, explanation and habit reversal, patients are shown how to breathe using their diaphragms prior to and during the normal rumination period. A similar breathing pattern can be used to prevent normal vomiting. Breathing in this method works by physically preventing the abdominal contractions required to expel stomach contents. Supportive therapy and diaphragmatic breathing has shown to cause improvement in 56% of cases, and total cessation of symptoms in an additional 30% in one study of 54 adolescent patients who were followed up 10 months after initial treatments. Patients who successfully use the technique often notice an immediate change in health for the better. Individuals who have had bulimia or who intentionally induced vomiting in the past have a reduced chance for improvement due to the reinforced behavior. The technique is not used with infants or young children due to the complex timing and concentration required for it to be successful. Most infants grow out of the disorder within a year or with aversive training.  Epidemiology  Age distribution at diagnosis Rumination disorder was initially documented as affecting newborns, infants, children and individuals with mental and functional disabilities (the cognitively handicapped). It has since been recognized to occur in both males and females of all ages and cognitive abilities. Among the cognitively handicapped, it is described with almost equal prevalence among infants (6-10% of the population) and institutionalized adults (8-10%). In infants, it typically occurs within the first 3-12 months of age. The occurrence of rumination syndrome within the general population has not been defined. Rumination is sometimes described as rare, but has also been described as not rare, but rather rarely recognized. The disorder has a female predominance. The typical age of adolescent onset is 12.9, give or take 0.4 years (¬±), with males affected sooner than females (11.0 ¬± 0.8 for males versus 13.8 ¬± 0.5 for females). There is little evidence concerning the impact of hereditary influence in rumination syndrome. However, case reports involving entire families with rumination exist.  History  The term rumination is derived from the Latin word ruminare, which means to chew the cud. First described in ancient times, and mentioned in the writings of Aristotle, rumination syndrome was clinically documented in 1618 by Italian anatomist Fabricus ab Aquapendente, who wrote of the symptoms in a patient of his. Among the earliest cases of rumination was that of a physician in the nineteenth century, Charles-√âdouard Brown-S√©quard, who acquired the condition as the result of experiments upon himself. As a way of evaluating and testing the acid response of the stomach to various foods, the doctor would swallow sponges tied to a string, then intentionally regurgitate them to analyze the contents. As a result of these experiments, the doctor eventually regurgitated his meals habitually by reflex. Numerous case reports exist from before the twentieth century, but were influenced greatly by the methods and thinking used in that time. By the early twentieth century, it was becoming increasingly evident that rumination presented itself in a variety of ways in response to a variety of conditions. Although still considered a disorder of infancy and cognitive disability at that time, the difference in presentation between infants and adults was well established. Studies of rumination in otherwise healthy adults became decreasingly rare starting in the 1900s, and the majority of published reports analyzing the syndrome in mentally healthy patients appeared thereafter. At first, adult rumination was described and treated as a benign condition. It is now described as otherwise. While the base of patients to examine has gradually increased as more and more people come forward with their symptoms, awareness of the condition by the medical community and the general public is still limited.  In other animals  The chewing of cud by animals such as cows, goats, and giraffes is considered normal behavior. These animals are known as ruminants. Such behavior, though termed rumination, is not related to human rumination syndrome, but is ordinary. Involuntary rumination, similar to what is seen in humans, has been described in gorillas and other primates. Macropods such as kangaroos also regurgitate, re-masticate, and re-swallow food, but these behaviors are not essential to their normal digestive process, are not observed as predictably as the ruminants', and hence were termed \\"merycism\\" in contrast with \\"true rumination\\".

A theory of inquiry is an account of the various types of inquiry and a treatment of the ways that each type of inquiry achieves its aim.

(Aristotle, Prior Analytics, 2.23) =Abduction= The locus classicus for the study of abductive reasoning is found in Aristotle's Prior Analytics, Book 2, Chapt. 25. It begins this way: > We have Reduction (Œ±œÄŒ±Œ≥œâŒ≥Œ∑, abduction): :# When it is obvious that the first > term applies to the middle, but that the middle applies to the last term is > not obvious, yet is nevertheless more probable or not less probable than the > conclusion; :# Or if there are not many intermediate terms between the last > and the middle; For in all such cases the effect is to bring us nearer to > knowledge. By way of explanation, Aristotle supplies two very instructive examples, one for each of the two varieties of abductive inference steps that he has just described in the abstract: > :# For example, let A stand for \\"that which can be taught\\", B for > \\"knowledge\\", and C for \\"morality\\".

(Aristotle, > \\"Prior Analytics\\", 2.25, with minor alterations) Aristotle's latter variety of abductive reasoning, though it will take some explaining in the sequel, is well worth our contemplation, since it hints already at streams of inquiry that course well beyond the syllogistic source from which they spring, and into regions that Peirce will explore more broadly and deeply. Inquiry in the pragmatic paradigm In the pragmatic philosophies of Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, John Dewey, and others, inquiry is closely associated with the normative science of logic. In its inception, the pragmatic model or theory of inquiry was extracted by Peirce from its raw materials in classical logic, with a little bit of help from Kant, and refined in parallel with the early development of symbolic logic by Boole, De Morgan, and Peirce himself to address problems about the nature and conduct of scientific reasoning. Borrowing a brace of concepts from Aristotle, Peirce examined three fundamental modes of reasoning that play a role in inquiry, commonly known as abductive, deductive, and inductive inference. In rough terms, abduction is what we use to generate a likely hypothesis or an initial diagnosis in response to a phenomenon of interest or a problem of concern, while deduction is used to clarify, to derive, and to explicate the relevant consequences of the selected hypothesis, and induction is used to test the sum of the predictions against the sum of the data. It needs to be observed that the classical and pragmatic treatments of the types of reasoning, dividing the generic territory of inference as they do into three special parts, arrive at a different characterization of the environs of reason than do those accounts that count only two. These three processes typically operate in a cyclic fashion, systematically operating to reduce the uncertainties and the difficulties that initiated the inquiry in question, and in this way, to the extent that inquiry is successful, leading to an increase in knowledge or in skills. In the pragmatic way of thinking everything has a purpose, and the purpose of each thing is the first thing we should try to note about it.Rescher, N. (2012). Pragmatism: The Restoration of its Scientific Roots. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Press. The purpose of inquiry is to reduce doubt and lead to a state of belief, which a person in that state will usually call knowledge or certainty. As they contribute to the end of inquiry, we should appreciate that the three kinds of inference describe a cycle that can be understood only as a whole, and none of the three makes complete sense in isolation from the others. For instance, the purpose of abduction is to generate guesses of a kind that deduction can explicate and that induction can evaluate. This places a mild but meaningful constraint on the production of hypotheses, since it is not just any wild guess at explanation that submits itself to reason and bows out when defeated in a match with reality. In a similar fashion, each of the other types of inference realizes its purpose only in accord with its proper role in the whole cycle of inquiry. No matter how much it may be necessary to study these processes in abstraction from each other, the integrity of inquiry places strong limitations on the effective modularity of its principal components. In Logic: The Theory of Inquiry, John Dewey defined inquiry as \\"the controlled or directed transformation of an indeterminate situation into one that is so determinate in its constituent distinctions and relations as to convert the elements of the original situation into a unified whole\\"Dewey, John (1938). Logic: The Theory of Inquiry. New York:NY: D.C. Heath & Co. Dewey and Peirce's conception of inquiry extended beyond a system of thinking and incorporated the social nature of inquiry. These ideas are summarize in the notion Community of inquiry.Wikisource:The Fixation of Belief =Art and science of inquiry= For our present purposes, the first feature to note in distinguishing the three principal modes of reasoning from each other is whether each of them is exact or approximate in character. In this light, deduction is the only one of the three types of reasoning that can be made exact, in essence, always deriving true conclusions from true premises, while abduction and induction are unavoidably approximate in their modes of operation, involving elements of fallible judgment in practice and inescapable error in their application. The reason for this is that deduction, in the ideal limit, can be rendered a purely internal process of the reasoning agent, while the other two modes of reasoning essentially demand a constant interaction with the outside world, a source of phenomena and problems that will no doubt continue to exceed the capacities of any finite resource, human or machine, to master. Situated in this larger reality, approximations can be judged appropriate only in relation to their context of use and can be judged fitting only with regard to a purpose in view. A parallel distinction that is often made in this connection is to call deduction a demonstrative form of inference, while abduction and induction are classed as non-demonstrative forms of reasoning. Strictly speaking, the latter two modes of reasoning are not properly called inferences at all. They are more like controlled associations of words or ideas that just happen to be successful often enough to be preserved as useful heuristic strategies in the repertoire of the agent. But non-demonstrative ways of thinking are inherently subject to error, and must be constantly checked out and corrected as needed in practice. In classical terminology, forms of judgment that require attention to the context and the purpose of the judgment are said to involve an element of \\"art\\", in a sense that is judged to distinguish them from \\"science\\", and in their renderings as expressive judgments to implicate arbiters in styles of rhetoric, as contrasted with logic. In a figurative sense, this means that only deductive logic can be reduced to an exact theoretical science, while the practice of any empirical science will always remain to some degree an art. =Zeroth order inquiry= Many aspects of inquiry can be recognized and usefully studied in very basic logical settings, even simpler than the level of syllogism, for example, in the realm of reasoning that is variously known as Boolean algebra, propositional calculus, sentential calculus, or zeroth- order logic. By way of approaching the learning curve on the gentlest availing slope, we may well begin at the level of zeroth-order inquiry, in effect, taking the syllogistic approach to inquiry only so far as the propositional or sentential aspects of the associated reasoning processes are concerned. One of the bonuses of doing this in the context of Peirce's logical work is that it provides us with doubly instructive exercises in the use of his logical graphs, taken at the level of his so-called \\"alpha graphs\\". In the case of propositional calculus or sentential logic, deduction comes down to applications of the transitive law for conditional implications and the approximate forms of inference hang on the properties that derive from these. In describing the various types of inference I will employ a few old \\"terms of art\\" from classical logic that are still of use in treating these kinds of simple problems in reasoning. : Deduction takes a Case, the minor premise X \\\\Rightarrow Y : and combines it with a Rule, the major premise Y \\\\Rightarrow Z : to arrive at a Fact, the demonstrative conclusion X \\\\Rightarrow Z. : Induction takes a Case of the form X \\\\Rightarrow Y : and matches it with a Fact of the form X \\\\Rightarrow Z : to infer a Rule of the form Y \\\\Rightarrow Z. : Abduction takes a Fact of the form X \\\\Rightarrow Z : and matches it with a Rule of the form Y \\\\Rightarrow Z : to infer a Case of the form X \\\\Rightarrow Y. For ease of reference, Figure 1 and the Legend beneath it summarize the classical terminology for the three types of inference and the relationships among them. {  o-------------------------------------------------o    Z   o   \\\\    \\\\    \\\\    \\\\    \\\\    \\\\ R U L E    \\\\    \\\\   F  \\\\    \\\\   A  \\\\    o Y   C  /    /   T  /    /    /    / C A S E    /    /    /    /   /   o   X     Deduction takes a Case of the form X ‚Üí Y,   matches it with a Rule of the form Y ‚Üí Z,   then adverts to a Fact of the form X ‚Üí Z.     Induction takes a Case of the form X ‚Üí Y,   matches it with a Fact of the form X ‚Üí Z,   then adverts to a Rule of the form Y ‚Üí Z.     Abduction takes a Fact of the form X ‚Üí Z,   matches it with a Rule of the form Y ‚Üí Z,   then adverts to a Case of the form X ‚Üí Y.     Even more succinctly:     Abduction Deduction Induction     Premise: Fact Case Case   Premise: Rule Rule Fact   Outcome: Case Fact Rule    o-------------------------------------------------o Figure 1. Elementary Structure and Terminology } In its original usage a statement of Fact has to do with a deed done or a record made, that is, a type of event that is openly observable and not riddled with speculation as to its very occurrence. In contrast, a statement of Case may refer to a hidden or a hypothetical cause, that is, a type of event that is not immediately observable to all concerned. Obviously, the distinction is a rough one and the question of which mode applies can depend on the points of view that different observers adopt over time. Finally, a statement of a Rule is called that because it states a regularity or a regulation that governs a whole class of situations, and not because of its syntactic form. So far in this discussion, all three types of constraint are expressed in the form of conditional propositions, but this is not a fixed requirement. In practice, these modes of statement are distinguished by the roles that they play within an argument, not by their style of expression. When the time comes to branch out from the syllogistic framework, we will find that propositional constraints can be discovered and represented in arbitrary syntactic forms. Example of inquiry Examples of inquiry, that illustrate the full cycle of its abductive, deductive, and inductive phases, and yet are both concrete and simple enough to be suitable for a first (or zeroth) exposition, are somewhat rare in Peirce's writings, and so let us draw one from the work of fellow pragmatician John Dewey, analyzing it according to the model of zeroth-order inquiry that we developed above. > A man is walking on a warm day. The sky was clear the last time he observed > it; but presently he notes, while occupied primarily with other things, that > the air is cooler. It occurs to him that it is probably going to rain; > looking up, he sees a dark cloud between him and the sun, and he then > quickens his steps. What, if anything, in such a situation can be called > thought? Neither the act of walking nor the noting of the cold is a thought. > Walking is one direction of activity; looking and noting are other modes of > activity. The likelihood that it will rain is, however, something suggested. > The pedestrian feels the cold; he thinks of clouds and a coming shower. > (John Dewey, How We Think, 1910, pp. 6-7). =Once over quickly= Let's first give Dewey's example of inquiry in everyday life the quick once over, hitting just the high points of its analysis into Peirce's three kinds of reasoning. Abductive phase In Dewey's \\"Rainy Day\\" or \\"Sign of Rain\\" story, we find our peripatetic hero presented with a surprising Fact: :* Fact: C ‚Üí A, In the Current situation the Air is cool. Responding to an intellectual reflex of puzzlement about the situation, his resource of common knowledge about the world is impelled to seize on an approximate Rule: :* Rule: B ‚Üí A, Just Before it rains, the Air is cool. This Rule can be recognized as having a potential relevance to the situation because it matches the surprising Fact, C ‚Üí A, in its consequential feature A. All of this suggests that the present Case may be one in which it is just about to rain: :* Case: C ‚Üí B, The Current situation is just Before it rains. The whole mental performance, however automatic and semi-conscious it may be, that leads up from a problematic Fact and a previously settled knowledge base of Rules to the plausible suggestion of a Case description, is what we are calling an abductive inference. Deductive phase The next phase of inquiry uses deductive inference to expand the implied consequences of the abductive hypothesis, with the aim of testing its truth. For this purpose, the inquirer needs to think of other things that would follow from the consequence of his precipitate explanation. Thus, he now reflects on the Case just assumed: :* Case: C ‚Üí B, The Current situation is just Before it rains. He looks up to scan the sky, perhaps in a random search for further information, but since the sky is a logical place to look for details of an imminent rainstorm, symbolized in our story by the letter B, we may safely suppose that our reasoner has already detached the consequence of the abduced Case, C ‚Üí B, and has begun to expand on its further implications. So let us imagine that our up-looker has a more deliberate purpose in mind, and that his search for additional data is driven by the new-found, determinate Rule: :* Rule: B ‚Üí D, Just Before it rains, Dark clouds appear. Contemplating the assumed Case in combination with this new Rule leads him by an immediate deduction to predict an additional Fact: :* Fact: C ‚Üí D, In the Current situation Dark clouds appear. The reconstructed picture of reasoning assembled in this second phase of inquiry is true to the pattern of deductive inference. Inductive phase Whatever the case, our subject observes a Dark cloud, just as he would expect on the basis of the new hypothesis. The explanation of imminent rain removes the discrepancy between observations and expectations and thereby reduces the shock of surprise that made this process of inquiry necessary. =Looking more closely= Seeding hypotheses Figure 4 gives a graphical illustration of Dewey's example of inquiry, isolating for the purposes of the present analysis the first two steps in the more extended proceedings that go to make up the whole inquiry. o-----------------------------------------------------------o    A D   o o   \\\\ * * /   \\\\ * * /   \\\\ * * /   \\\\ * * /   \\\\ * * /   \\\\ R u l e R u l e /   \\\\ * * /   \\\\ * * /   \\\\ * * /   \\\\ * B * /   F a c t o F a c t   \\\\ * /   \\\\ * /   \\\\ * /   \\\\ * /   \\\\ C a s e /   \\\\ * /   \\\\ * /   \\\\ * /   \\\\ * /   \\\\ * /   \\\\*/   o   C     A = the Air is cool   B = just Before it rains   C = the Current situation   D = a Dark cloud appears     A is a major term   B is a middle term   C is a minor term   D is a major term, associated with A    o-----------------------------------------------------------o Figure 4. Dewey's 'Rainy Day' Inquiry In this analysis of the first steps of Inquiry, we have a complex or a mixed form of inference that can be seen as taking place in two steps: :* The first step is an Abduction that abstracts a Case from the consideration of a Fact and a Rule. :: Fact: C ‚Üí A, In the Current situation the Air is cool. :: Rule: B ‚Üí A, Just Before it rains, the Air is cool. :: Case: C ‚Üí B, The Current situation is just Before it rains. :* The final step is a Deduction that admits this Case to another Rule and so arrives at a novel Fact. :: Case: C ‚Üí B, The Current situation is just Before it rains. :: Rule: B ‚Üí D, Just Before it rains, a Dark cloud will appear. :: Fact: C ‚Üí D, In the Current situation, a Dark cloud will appear. This is nowhere near a complete analysis of the Rainy Day inquiry, even insofar as it might be carried out within the constraints of the syllogistic framework, and it covers only the first two steps of the relevant inquiry process, but maybe it will do for a start. One other thing needs to be noticed here, the formal duality between this expansion phase of inquiry and the argument from analogy. This can be seen most clearly in the propositional lattice diagrams shown in Figures 3 and 4, where analogy exhibits a rough \\"A\\" shape and the first two steps of inquiry exhibit a rough \\"V\\" shape, respectively. Since we find ourselves repeatedly referring to this expansion phase of inquiry as a unit, let's give it a name that suggests its duality with analogy‚Äî\\"catalogy\\" will do for the moment. This usage is apt enough if one thinks of a catalogue entry for an item as a text that lists its salient features. Notice that analogy has to do with the examples of a given quality, while catalogy has to do with the qualities of a given example. Peirce noted similar forms of duality in many of his early writings, leading to the consummate treatment in his 1867 paper \\"On a New List of Categories\\" (CP 1.545-559, W 2, 49-59). Weeding hypotheses In order to comprehend the bearing of inductive reasoning on the closing phases of inquiry there are a couple of observations that we need to make: :* First, we need to recognize that smaller inquiries are typically woven into larger inquiries, whether we view the whole pattern of inquiry as carried on by a single agent or by a complex community. :* Further, we need to consider the different ways in which the particular instances of inquiry can be related to ongoing inquiries at larger scales. Three modes of inductive interaction between the micro-inquiries and the macro-inquiries that are salient here can be described under the headings of the \\"Learning\\", the \\"Transfer\\", and the \\"Testing\\" of rules. Analogy of experience Throughout inquiry the reasoner makes use of rules that have to be transported across intervals of experience, from the masses of experience where they are learned to the moments of experience where they are applied. Inductive reasoning is involved in the learning and the transfer of these rules, both in accumulating a knowledge base and in carrying it through the times between acquisition and application. :* Learning. The principal way that induction contributes to an ongoing inquiry is through the learning of rules, that is, by creating each of the rules that goes into the knowledge base, or ever gets used along the way. :* Transfer. The continuing way that induction contributes to an ongoing inquiry is through the exploit of analogy, a two-step combination of induction and deduction that serves to transfer rules from one context to another. :* Testing. Finally, every inquiry that makes use of a knowledge base constitutes a \\"field test\\" of its accumulated contents. If the knowledge base fails to serve any live inquiry in a satisfactory manner, then there is a prima facie reason to reconsider and possibly to amend some of its rules. Let's now consider how these principles of learning, transfer, and testing apply to John Dewey's \\"Sign of Rain\\" example. =Learning= Rules in a knowledge base, as far as their effective content goes, can be obtained by any mode of inference. For example, a rule like: :* Rule: B ‚Üí A, Just Before it rains, the Air is cool, is usually induced from a consideration of many past events, in a manner that can be rationally reconstructed as follows: :* Case: C ‚Üí B, In Certain events, it is just Before it rains, :* Fact: C ‚Üí A, In Certain events, the Air is cool, : ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ :* Rule: B ‚Üí A, Just Before it rains, the Air is cool. However, the very same proposition could also be abduced as an explanation of a singular occurrence or deduced as a conclusion of a presumptive theory. =Transfer= What is it that gives a distinctively inductive character to the acquisition of a knowledge base? It is evidently the \\"analogy of experience\\" that underlies its useful application. Whenever we find ourselves prefacing an argument with the phrase \\"If past experience is any guide...\\" then we can be sure that this principle has come into play. We are invoking an analogy between past experience, considered as a totality, and present experience, considered as a point of application. What we mean in practice is this: \\"If past experience is a fair sample of possible experience, then the knowledge gained in it applies to present experience\\". This is the mechanism that allows a knowledge base to be carried across gulfs of experience that are indifferent to the effective contents of its rules. Here are the details of how this notion of transfer works out in the case of the \\"Sign of Rain\\" example: Let K(pres) be a portion of the reasoner's knowledge base that is logically equivalent to the conjunction of two rules, as follows: :* K(pres) = (B ‚Üí A) and (B ‚Üí D). K(pres) is the present knowledge base, expressed in the form of a logical constraint on the present universe of discourse. It is convenient to have the option of expressing all logical statements in terms of their logical models, that is, in terms of the primitive circumstances or the elements of experience over which they hold true. :* Let E(past) be the chosen set of experiences, or the circumstances that we have in mind when we refer to \\"past experience\\". :* Let E(poss) be the collective set of experiences, or the projective total of possible circumstances. :* Let E(pres) be the present experience, or the circumstances that are present to the reasoner at the current moment. If we think of the knowledge base K(pres) as referring to the \\"regime of experience\\" over which it is valid, then all of these sets of models can be compared by the simple relations of set inclusion or logical implication. Figure 5 schematizes this way of viewing the \\"analogy of experience\\". o-----------------------------------------------------------o    K(pres)   o   /\\\\   /  \\\\   /  \\\\   /  \\\\   / Rule \\\\   /  \\\\   /  \\\\   /  \\\\   / E(poss) \\\\   Fact / o \\\\ Fact   / * * \\\\   / * * \\\\   / * * \\\\   / * * \\\\   / * * \\\\   / * Case Case * \\\\   / * * \\\\   / * * \\\\   /* *\\\\   o<<<---------------<<<---------------<< In these terms, the \\"analogy of experience\\" proceeds by inducing a Rule about the validity of a current knowledge base and then deducing a Fact, its applicability to a current experience, as in the following sequence: Inductive Phase: :* Given Case: E(past) ‚Üí E(poss), Chosen events fairly sample Collective events. :* Given Fact: E(past) ‚Üí K(pres), Chosen events support the Knowledge regime. : ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- :* Induce Rule: E(poss) ‚Üí K(pres), Collective events support the Knowledge regime. Deductive Phase: :* Given Case: E(pres) ‚Üí E(poss), Current events fairly sample Collective events. :* Given Rule: E(poss) ‚Üí K(pres), Collective events support the Knowledge regime. : -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- :* Deduce Fact: E(pres) ‚Üí K(pres), Current events support the Knowledge regime. =Testing= If the observer looks up and does not see dark clouds, or if he runs for shelter but it does not rain, then there is fresh occasion to question the utility or the validity of his knowledge base. But we must leave our foulweather friend for now and defer the logical analysis of this testing phase to another occasion. See also * Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography * Community of inquiry * C.

He was Provost of Portsmouth Cathedral from 1982 to 1993, and the Bishop of Salisbury from 1993 to 2010. He is the third generation of his family to serve the ordained ministry. Early life The son of Michael Stancliffe, former Dean of Winchester, who was himself ordained at Salisbury Cathedral, Stancliffe was born in 1942 in Devizes, Wiltshire, where his father was curate of St James' Southbroom, later serving at Ramsbury and Cirencester before becoming Chaplain to Westminster School. It was from Westminster School that Stancliffe went to Trinity College, Oxford to study classics and philosophy and where he was Organ Scholar. He had a Master of Arts (MA Oxon) degree from Oxford. While at university, Stancliffe abandoned thoughts of a musical career in favour of ordination and instead went to theological training at Cuddesdon College in October 1965. Ordained ministry Stancliffe was ordained as a deacon on 8 December 1967 by John Moorman, Bishop of Ripon, at the chapel of the Hostel of the Resurrection, University of Leeds and as a priest on 22 December 1968 by Howard Cruse, Bishop of Knaresborough, at Ripon Cathedral. Stancliffe served as curate of the Leeds parish of St Bartholomew's Armley. Three years later he returned to the West Country as chaplain to Clifton College, Bristol.Crockfords (London, Church House 1995) In 1977, Stancliffe was appointed a canon residentiary of Portsmouth Cathedral and the diocesan director of ordinands and, subsequently, the lay ministerial adviser. For a time he also undertook the role of precentor in a combination of duties which recognised his special interests in the areas of liturgy, church architecture and music, while also involving him in clergy formation and training and the work of the parishes in the diocese. Stancliffe was appointed Provost of Portsmouth in 1982Debrett's People of Today: Ed Ellis, P (1992, London, Debrett's) ) and his major work from then until 1993 was the completion and reordering of Portsmouth Cathedral, shaping its life and work to fulfil its primary function of supporting the Bishop of Portsmouth in his ministry. Alongside other duties in the Diocese of Portsmouth, he was vice-chairman of the governors of Portsmouth Grammar School, a governor of Chichester Theological College, a member of the governing bodies of the Southern Dioceses Ministerial Training Scheme and of Salisbury & Wells Theological College and chairman of the Southern Regional Institute. In July 1993, Stancliffe succeeded Colin James, Bishop of Winchester, as chairman of the Church of England's Liturgical Commission, a position which he held until 2005. He served on the commission from 1986. Work with the commission has involved the publication of The Promise of His Glory and the preparation and publication of the Common Worship liturgies. This significant contribution to the life of the Church of England was recognised by the award by Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, of a Lambeth Doctorate in Divinity (DD) in 2004. Stancliffe has been a member of the Council for the Care of Churches. Stancliffe was consecrated a bishop on 30 November 1993, by George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury, at Westminster Abbey, and enthroned Bishop of Salisbury in Salisbury Cathedral on 9 December 1993. In June 2008, Stancliffe suffered a stroke and while remaining Bishop of Salisbury took a leave of absence from episcopal duties. On 6 January 2010 he announced his intention to retire from the See of Salisbury.The Daily Telegraph \\"Retirements and resignations in the clergy\\" p. 32 Issue 48,094 (dated 18 January 2010 His final act as bishop was the ordination of priests in Salisbury Cathedral at Petertide on 3 July 2010.Diocese of Salisbury \\"Press Release - Bishop to resign\\" (6 January 2010) Although he officially retired as of 13 July 2010, he continued in his duties at General Synod and completed his commitments as bishop and member of the House of Lords. He is a fellow of St Chad's College, Durham, the president of Affirming Catholicism and vice-president of the Royal School of Church Music. On 11 February 2017, fourteen retired bishops signed an open letter to the then-serving bishops of the Church of England. In an unprecedented move, they expressed their opposition to the House of Bishops' report to General Synod on sexuality, which recommended no change to the church's canons or practises around sexuality.Retired Bishops' Letter ‚Äî The Letter (Accessed 11 February 2017; the fourteen bishops were David Atkinson, Michael Doe, Tim Ellis, David Gillett, John Gladwin, Laurie Green, Richard Harries, Stephen Lowe, Stephen Platten, John Pritchard, Peter Selby, Tim Stevens, Martin Wharton, and Williamson.)

English words such as \\"understanding\\" are sometimes used, but three commonly used philosophical terms come directly from classical languages: ŒΩŒø·ø¶œÇ or ŒΩœåŒøœÇ (from Ancient Greek), intellƒìctus and intellegentia (from Latin). To describe the activity of this faculty, the word \\"intellection\\" is sometimes used in philosophical contexts, as well as the Greek words noƒìsis and noe√Æn (ŒΩœåŒ∑œÉŒπœÇ, ŒΩŒøŒµ·øñŒΩ). This activity is understood in a similar way (at least in some contexts) to the modern concept of intuition. In philosophy, common English translations include \\"understanding\\" and \\"mind\\"; or sometimes \\"thought\\" or \\"reason\\" (in the sense of that which reasons, not the activity of reasoning).See entry for ŒΩœåŒøœÇ in Liddell & Scott, on the Perseus Project.See entry for intellectus in Lewis & Short, on the Perseus Project. It is also often described as something equivalent to perception except that it works within the mind (\\"the mind's eye\\"). page 38. It has been suggested that the basic meaning is something like \\"awareness\\".\\"This quest for the beginnings proceeds through sense perception, reasoning, and what they call noesis, which is literally translated by \\"understanding\\" or intellect,\\" and which we can perhaps translate a little bit more cautiously by \\"awareness,\\" an awareness of the mind's eye as distinguished from sensible awareness.\\" . In colloquial British English, nous also denotes \\"good sense\\", which is close to one everyday meaning it had in Ancient Greece. spheres of the cosmos, derived from Aristotle, and as per the standard explanation by Ptolemy. It came to be understood that at least the outermost sphere (marked \\"Prim≈© Mobile\\") has its own intellect, intelligence or nous - a cosmic equivalent to the human mind. In Aristotle's influential works, the term was carefully distinguished from sense perception, imagination, and reason, although these terms are closely inter-related. The term was apparently already singled out by earlier philosophers such as Parmenides, whose works are largely lost. In post- Aristotelian discussions, the exact boundaries between perception, understanding of perception, and reasoning have not always agreed with the definitions of Aristotle, even though his terminology remains influential. In the Aristotelian scheme, nous is the basic understanding or awareness that allows human beings to think rationally. For Aristotle, this was distinct from the processing of sensory perception, including the use of imagination and memory, which other animals can do. This therefore connects discussion of nous to discussion of how the human mind sets definitions in a consistent and communicable way, and whether people must be born with some innate potential to understand the same universal categories in the same logical ways. Deriving from this it was also sometimes argued, especially in classical and medieval philosophy, that the individual nous must require help of a spiritual and divine type. By this type of account, it came to be argued that the human understanding (nous) somehow stems from this cosmic nous, which is however not just a recipient of order, but a creator of it. Such explanations were influential in the development of medieval accounts of God, the immortality of the soul, and even the motions of the stars, in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, amongst both eclectic philosophers and authors representing all the major faiths of their times. Pre-Socratic usage The earliest surviving text that uses the word nous is the Iliad. Agamemnon says to Achilles: \\"Do not thus, mighty though you are, godlike Achilles, seek to deceive me with your wit (nous); for you will not get by me nor persuade me.\\"This is from I.130, the translation is by A.T. Murray, 1924. In early Greek uses, Homer used nous to signify mental activities of both mortals and immortals, for example what they really have on their mind as opposed to what they say aloud. It was one of several words related to thought, thinking, and perceiving with the mind. In pre-Socratic philosophy, it became increasingly distinguished as a source of knowledge and reasoning opposed to mere sense perception or thinking influenced by the body such as emotion. For example, Heraclitus complained that \\"much learning does not teach nous\\". Among some Greek authors, a faculty of intelligence known as a \\"higher mind\\" came to be considered as a property of the cosmos as a whole. The work of Parmenides set the scene for Greek philosophy to come and the concept of nous was central to his radical proposals. He claimed that reality as the senses perceive it is not a world of truth at all, because sense perception is so unreliable, and what is perceived is so uncertain and changeable. Instead he argued for a dualism wherein nous and related words (the verb for thinking which describes its mental perceiving activity, noein, and the unchanging and eternal objects of this perception, noƒìta) describe a form of perception which is not physical, but intellectual only, distinct from sense perception and the objects of sense perception. Anaxagoras Anaxagoras, born about 500 BC, is the first person who is definitely known to have explained the concept of a nous (mind), which arranged all other things in the cosmos in their proper order, started them in a rotating motion, and continuing to control them to some extent, having an especially strong connection with living things. (However Aristotle reports an earlier philosopher, Hermotimus of Clazomenae, who had taken a similar position.Metaphysics I.4.984b.) Amongst the pre-Socratic philosophers before Anaxagoras, other philosophers had proposed a similar ordering human-like principle causing life and the rotation of the heavens. For example, Empedocles, like Hesiod much earlier, described cosmic order and living things as caused by a cosmic version of love, Chapter X. and Pythagoras and Heraclitus, attributed the cosmos with \\"reason\\" (logos).. See pages 204 and 235. According to Anaxagoras the cosmos is made of infinitely divisible matter, every bit of which can inherently become anything, except Mind (nous), which is also matter, but which can only be found separated from this general mixture, or else mixed into living things, or in other words in the Greek terminology of the time, things with a soul (psychƒì). Chapter XII. Anaxagoras wrote: Concerning cosmology, Anaxagoras, like some Greek philosophers already before him, believed the cosmos was revolving, and had formed into its visible order as a result of such revolving causing a separating and mixing of different types of chemical elements. Nous, in his system, originally caused this revolving motion to start, but it does not necessarily continue to play a role once the mechanical motion has started. His description was in other words (shockingly for the time) corporeal or mechanical, with the moon made of earth, the sun and stars made of red hot metal (beliefs Socrates was later accused of holding during his trial) and nous itself being a physical fine type of matter which also gathered and concentrated with the development of the cosmos. This nous (mind) is not incorporeal; it is the thinnest of all things. The distinction between nous and other things nevertheless causes his scheme to sometimes be described as a peculiar kind of dualism. Anaxagoras' concept of nous was distinct from later platonic and neoplatonic cosmologies in many ways, which were also influenced by Eleatic, Pythagorean and other pre-Socratic ideas, as well as the Socratics themselves. In some schools of Hindu philosophy, a \\"higher mind\\" came to be considered a property of the cosmos as a whole that exists within all matter (known as buddhi or mahat). In Samkhya, this faculty of intellect (buddhi) serves to differentiate matter (prakrti) from pure consciousness (purusha). The lower aspect of mind that corresponds to the senses is referred to as \\"manas\\". Socratic philosophy =Xenophon= Xenophon, the less famous of the two students of Socrates whose written accounts of him have survived, recorded that he taught his students a kind of teleological justification of piety and respect for divine order in nature. This has been described as an \\"intelligent design\\" argument for the existence of God, in which nature has its own nous.For example: , pp. 273-275; and . It has been claimed that his report might be the earliest report of such an argument in For example, in his Memorabilia 1.4.8, he describes Socrates asking a friend sceptical of religion, \\"Are you, then, of the opinion that intelligence (nous) alone exists nowhere and that you by some good chance seized hold of it, while‚Äîas you think‚Äîthose surpassingly large and infinitely numerous things [all the earth and water] are in such orderly condition through some senselessness?\\" Later in the same discussion he compares the nous, which directs each person's body, to the good sense (phronƒìsis) of the god, which is in everything, arranging things to its pleasure (1.4.17).The translation quoted is from Amy Bonnette. Plato describes Socrates making the same argument in his Philebus 28d, using the same words nous and phronƒìsis.On the Perseus Project: 28d =Plato= Plato used the word nous in many ways that were not unusual in the everyday Greek of the time, and often simply meant \\"good sense\\" or \\"awareness\\".. In ancient Greek the word was used for phrases such as \\"keep in mind\\" and \\"to my mind\\". On the other hand, in some of his Platonic dialogues it is described by key characters in a higher sense, which was apparently already common. In his Philebus 28c he has Socrates say that \\"all philosophers agree‚Äîwhereby they really exalt themselves‚Äîthat mind (nous) is king of heaven and earth. Perhaps they are right.\\" and later states that the ensuing discussion \\"confirms the utterances of those who declared of old that mind (nous) always rules the universe\\".28c and 30d. Translation by Fowler. In his Cratylus, Plato gives the etymology of Athena's name, the goddess of wisdom, from Atheon√≥a (·ºàŒ∏ŒµŒøŒΩœåŒ±) meaning \\"god's (theos) mind (nous)\\". In his Phaedo, Plato's teacher Socrates is made to say just before dying that his discovery of Anaxagoras' concept of a cosmic nous as the cause of the order of things, was an important turning point for him. But he also expressed disagreement with Anaxagoras' understanding of the implications of his own doctrine, because of Anaxagoras' materialist understanding of causation. Socrates said that Anaxagoras would \\"give voice and air and hearing and countless other things of the sort as causes for our talking with each other, and should fail to mention the real causes, which are, that the Athenians decided that it was best to condemn me\\".Fowler translation of the Phaedo as on the Perseus webpage: 97-98. On the other hand, Socrates seems to suggest that he also failed to develop a fully satisfactory teleological and dualistic understanding of a mind of nature, whose aims represent the Good, which all parts of nature aim at. Concerning the nous that is the source of understanding of individuals, Plato is widely understood to have used ideas from Parmenides in addition to Anaxagoras. Like Parmenides, Plato argued that relying on sense perception can never lead to true knowledge, only opinion. Instead, Plato's more philosophical characters argue that nous must somehow perceive truth directly in the ways gods and daimons perceive. What our mind sees directly in order to really understand things must not be the constantly changing material things, but unchanging entities that exist in a different way, the so-called \\"forms\\" or \\"ideas\\". However he knew that contemporary philosophers often argued (as in modern science) that nous and perception are just two aspects of one physical activity, and that perception is the source of knowledge and understanding (not the other way around). Just exactly how Plato believed that the nous of people lets them come to understand things in any way that improves upon sense perception and the kind of thinking which animals have, is a subject of long running discussion and debate. On the one hand, in the Republic Plato's Socrates, in the Analogy of the sun and Allegory of the Cave describes people as being able to perceive more clearly because of something from outside themselves, something like when the sun shines, helping eyesight. The source of this illumination for the intellect is referred to as the Form of the Good. On the other hand, in the Meno for example, Plato's Socrates explains the theory of anamnesis whereby people are born with ideas already in their soul, which they somehow remember from previous lives. Both theories were to become highly influential. As in Xenophon, Plato's Socrates frequently describes the soul in a political way, with ruling parts, and parts that are by nature meant to be ruled. Nous is associated with the rational (logistikon) part of the individual human soul, which by nature should rule. In his Republic, in the so-called \\"analogy of the divided line\\", it has a special function within this rational part. Plato tended to treat nous as the only immortal part of the soul. Concerning the cosmos, in the Timaeus, the title character also tells a \\"likely story\\" in which nous is responsible for the creative work of the demiurge or maker who brought rational order to our universe. This craftsman imitated what he perceived in the world of eternal Forms. In the Philebus Socrates argues that nous in individual humans must share in a cosmic nous, in the same way that human bodies are made up of small parts of the elements found in the rest of the universe. And this nous must be in the genos of being a cause of all particular things as particular things.Philebus on the Perseus Project: 23b-30e. Translation is by Fowler. =Aristotle= Like Plato, Aristotle saw the nous or intellect of an individual as somehow similar to sense perception but also distinct.Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Aristotle's Ethics, Glossary of terms. Sense perception in action provides images to the nous, via the \\"sensus communis\\" and imagination, without which thought could not occur. But other animals have sensus communis and imagination, whereas none of them have nous.De Anima Book III, chapter 3. Aristotelians divide perception of forms into the animal-like one which perceives species sensibilis or sensible forms, and species intelligibilis that are perceived in a different way by the nous. Like Plato, Aristotle linked nous to logos (reason) as uniquely human, but he also distinguished nous from logos, thereby distinguishing the faculty for setting definitions from the faculty that uses them to reason with.\\"Intelligence (nous) apprehend each definition (horos meaning \\"boundary\\"), which cannot be proved by reasoning\\". Nicomachean Ethics 1142a, Rackham translation. In his Nicomachean Ethics, Book VI Aristotle divides the soul (psychƒì) into two parts, one which has reason and one which does not, but then divides the part which has reason into the reasoning (logistikos) part itself which is lower, and the higher \\"knowing\\" (epistƒìmonikos) part which contemplates general principles (archai). Nous, he states, is the source of the first principles or sources (archai) of definitions, and it develops naturally as people gain experience.This is also discussed by him in the Posterior Analytics II.19. This he explains after first comparing the four other truth revealing capacities of soul: technical know how (technƒì), logically deduced knowledge (epistƒìmƒì, sometimes translated as \\"scientific knowledge\\"), practical wisdom (phronƒìsis), and lastly theoretical wisdom (sophia), which is defined by Aristotle as the combination of nous and epistƒìmƒì. All of these others apart from nous are types of reason (logos). Aristotle's philosophical works continue many of the same Socratic themes as his teacher Plato. Amongst the new proposals he made was a way of explaining causality, and nous is an important part of his explanation. As mentioned above, Plato criticized Anaxagoras' materialism, or understanding that the intellect of nature only set the cosmos in motion, but is no longer seen as the cause of physical events. Aristotle explained that the changes of things can be described in terms of four causes at the same time. Two of these four causes are similar to the materialist understanding: each thing has a material which causes it to be how it is, and some other thing which set in motion or initiated some process of change. But at the same time according to Aristotle each thing is also caused by the natural forms they are tending to become, and the natural ends or aims, which somehow exist in nature as causes, even in cases where human plans and aims are not involved. These latter two causes (the \\"formal\\" and \\"final\\"), are concepts no longer used in modern science, and encompass the continuous effect of the intelligent ordering principle of nature itself. Aristotle's special description of causality is especially apparent in the natural development of living things. It leads to a method whereby Aristotle analyses causation and motion in terms of the potentialities and actualities of all things, whereby all matter possesses various possibilities or potentialities of form and end, and these possibilities become more fully real as their potential forms become actual or active reality (something they will do on their own, by nature, unless stopped because of other natural things happening). For example, a stone has in its nature the potentiality of falling to the earth and it will do so, and actualize this natural tendency, if nothing is in the way. Aristotle analyzed thinking in the same way. For him, the possibility of understanding rests on the relationship between intellect and sense perception. Aristotle's remarks on the concept of what came to be called the \\"active intellect\\" and \\"passive intellect\\" (along with various other terms) are amongst \\"the most intensely studied sentences in the history of philosophy\\". The terms are derived from a single passage in Aristotle's De Anima, Book III. Following is the translation of one of those passagesDe Anima, Bk. III, ch. 5, 430a10-25 translated by Joe Sachs, Aristotle's On the Soul and On Memory and Recollection, Green Lion Books with some key Greek words shown in square brackets. > ...since in nature one thing is the material [hulƒì] for each kind [genos] > (this is what is in potency all the particular things of that kind) but it > is something else that is the causal and productive thing by which all of > them are formed, as is the case with an art in relation to its material, it > is necessary in the soul [psychƒì] too that these distinct aspects be > present; > the one sort is intellect [nous] by becoming all things, the other sort by > forming all things, in the way an active condition [hexis] like light too > makes the colors that are in potency be at work as colors [to ph≈çs poiei ta > dunamei onta chr≈çmata energeiai chr≈çmata]. > This sort of intellect [which is like light in the way it makes potential > things work as what they are] is separate, as well as being without > attributes and unmixed, since it is by its thinghood a being-at-work > [energeia], for what acts is always distinguished in stature above what is > acted upon, as a governing source is above the material it works on. > Knowledge [epistƒìmƒì], in its being-at-work, is the same as the thing it > knows, and while knowledge in potency comes first in time in any one knower, > in the whole of things it does not take precedence even in time. > This does not mean that at one time it thinks but at another time it does > not think, but when separated it is just exactly what it is, and this alone > is deathless and everlasting (though we have no memory, because this sort of > intellect is not acted upon, while the sort that is acted upon is > destructible), and without this nothing thinks. The passage tries to explain \\"how the human intellect passes from its original state, in which it does not think, to a subsequent state, in which it does\\" according to his distinction between potentiality and actuality. Aristotle says that the passive intellect receives the intelligible forms of things, but that the active intellect is required to make the potential knowledge into actual knowledge, in the same way that light makes potential colours into actual colours. As Davidson remarks: > Just what Aristotle meant by potential intellect and active intellect - > terms not even explicit in the De anima and at best implied - and just how > he understood the interaction between them remains moot. Students of the > history of philosophy continue to debate Aristotle's intent, particularly > the question whether he considered the active intellect to be an aspect of > the human soul or an entity existing independently of man. The passage is often read together with Metaphysics, Book XII, ch.7-10, where Aristotle makes nous as an actuality a central subject within a discussion of the cause of being and the cosmos. In that book, Aristotle equates active nous, when people think and their nous becomes what they think about, with the \\"unmoved mover\\" of the universe, and God: \\"For the actuality of thought (nous) is life, and God is that actuality; and the essential actuality of God is life most good and eternal.\\"See Metaphysics 1072b. Alexander of Aphrodisias, for example, equated this active intellect which is God with the one explained in De Anima, while Themistius thought they could not be simply equated. (See below.) Like Plato before him, Aristotle believes Anaxagoras' cosmic nous implies and requires the cosmos to have intentions or ends: \\"Anaxagoras makes the Good a principle as causing motion; for Mind (nous) moves things, but moves them for some end, and therefore there must be some other Good‚Äîunless it is as we say; for on our view the art of medicine is in a sense health.\\"1075 In the philosophy of Aristotle the soul (psyche) of a body is what makes it alive, and is its actualized form; thus, every living thing, including plant life, has a soul. The mind or intellect (nous) can be described variously as a power, faculty, part, or aspect of the human soul. For Aristotle, soul and nous are not the same. He did not rule out the possibility that nous might survive without the rest of the soul, as in Plato, but he specifically says that this immortal nous does not include any memories or anything else specific to an individual's life. In his Generation of Animals Aristotle specifically says that while other parts of the soul come from the parents, physically, the human nous, must come from outside, into the body, because it is divine or godly, and it has nothing in common with the energeia of the body.Generation of Animals II.iii.736b. This was yet another passage which Alexander of Aphrodisias would link to those mentioned above from De Anima and the Metaphysics in order to understand Aristotle's intentions. =Post Aristotelian classical theories= Until the early modern era, much of the discussion which has survived today concerning nous or intellect, in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, concerned how to correctly interpret Aristotle and Plato. However, at least during the classical period, materialist philosophies, more similar to modern science, such as Epicureanism, were still relatively common also. The Epicureans believed that the bodily senses themselves were not the cause of error, but the interpretations can be. The term prolepsis was used by Epicureans to describe the way the mind forms general concepts from sense perceptions. To the Stoics, more like Heraclitus than Anaxagoras, order in the cosmos comes from an entity called logos, the cosmic reason. But as in Anaxagoras this cosmic reason, like human reason but higher, is connected to the reason of individual humans. The Stoics however, did not invoke incorporeal causation, but attempted to explain physics and human thinking in terms of matter and forces. As in Aristotelianism, they explained the interpretation of sense data requiring the mind to be stamped or formed with ideas, and that people have shared conceptions that help them make sense of things (koine ennoia). Nous for them is soul \\"somehow disposed\\" (p√¥s echon), the soul being somehow disposed pneuma, which is fire or air or a mixture. As in Plato, they treated nous as the ruling part of the soul. Plutarch criticized the Stoic idea of nous being corporeal, and agreed with Plato that the soul is more divine than the body while nous (mind) is more divine than the soul. The mix of soul and body produces pleasure and pain; the conjunction of mind and soul produces reason which is the cause or the source of virtue and vice. (From: ‚ÄúOn the Face in the Moon‚Äù)Lacus Curtius online text: On the Face in the Moon par. 28 Albinus was one of the earliest authors to equate Aristotle's nous as prime mover of the Universe, with Plato's Form of the Good. Alexander of Aphrodisias Alexander of Aphrodisias was a Peripatetic (Aristotelian) and his On the Soul (referred to as De anima in its traditional Latin title), explained that by his interpretation of Aristotle, potential intellect in man, that which has no nature but receives one from the active intellect, is material, and also called the \\"material intellect\\" (nous hulikos) and it is inseparable from the body, being \\"only a disposition\\" of it.De anima 84, cited in Davidson, page 9, who translated the quoted words. He argued strongly against the doctrine of immortality. On the other hand, he identified the active intellect (nous poietikos), through whose agency the potential intellect in man becomes actual, not with anything from within people, but with the divine creator itself. In the early Renaissance his doctrine of the soul's mortality was adopted by Pietro Pomponazzi against the Thomists and the Averroists. For him, the only possible human immortality is an immortality of a detached human thought, more specifically when the nous has as the object of its thought the active intellect itself, or another incorporeal intelligible form.Davidson p.43 Alexander was also responsible for influencing the development of several more technical terms concerning the intellect, which became very influential amongst the great Islamic philosophers, Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and Averroes. *The intellect in habitu is a stage in which the human intellect has taken possession of a repertoire of thoughts, and so is potentially able to think those thoughts, but is not yet thinking these thoughts. *The intellect from outside, which became the \\"acquired intellect\\" in Islamic philosophy, describes the incorporeal active intellect which comes from outside man, and becomes an object of thought, making the material intellect actual and active. This term may have come from a particularly expressive translation of Alexander into Arabic. Plotinus also used such a term.Davidson page 12. In any case, in Al-Farabi and Avicenna, the term took on a new meaning, distinguishing it from the active intellect in any simple sense - an ultimate stage of the human intellect where a kind of close relationship (a \\"conjunction\\") is made between a person's active intellect and the transcendental nous itself. Themistius Themistius, another influential commentator on this matter, understood Aristotle differently, stating that the passive or material intellect does \\"not employ a bodily organ for its activity, is wholly unmixed with the body, impassive, and separate [from matter]\\".Translation and citation by Davidson again, from Themistius' paraphrase of Aristotle's De Anima. This means the human potential intellect, and not only the active intellect, is an incorporeal substance, or a disposition of incorporeal substance. For Themistius, the human soul becomes immortal \\"as soon as the active intellect intertwines with it at the outset of human thought\\". This understanding of the intellect was also very influential for Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, and \\"virtually all Islamic and Jewish philosophers\\".Davidson page 13. On the other hand, concerning the active intellect, like Alexander and Plotinus, he saw this as a transcendent being existing above and outside man. Differently from Alexander, he did not equate this being with the first cause of the Universe itself, but something lower.Davidson page 14. However he equated it with Plato's Idea of the Good.Davidson p.18 Plotinus and Neoplatonism Of the later Greek and Roman writers Plotinus, the initiator of neoplatonism, is particularly significant. Like Alexander of Aphrodisias and Themistius, he saw himself as a commentator explaining the doctrines of Plato and Aristotle. But in his Enneads he went further than those authors, often working from passages which had been presented more tentatively, possibly inspired partly by earlier authors such as the neopythagorean Numenius of Apamea. Neoplatonism provided a major inspiration to discussion concerning the intellect in late classical and medieval philosophy, theology and cosmology. In neoplatonism there exists several levels or hypostases of being, including the natural and visible world as a lower part. *The Monad or \\"the One\\" sometimes also described as \\"the Good\\", based on the concept as it is found in Plato. This is the dunamis or possibility of existence. It causes the other levels by emanation. *The Nous (usually translated as \\"Intellect\\", or \\"Intelligence\\" in this context, or sometimes \\"mind\\" or \\"reason\\") is described as God, or more precisely an image of God, often referred to as the Demiurge. It thinks its own contents, which are thoughts, equated to the Platonic ideas or forms (eide). The thinking of this Intellect is the highest activity of life. The actualization (energeia) of this thinking is the being of the forms. This Intellect is the first principle or foundation of existence. The One is prior to it, but not in the sense that a normal cause is prior to an effect, but instead Intellect is called an emanation of the One. The One is the possibility of this foundation of existence. *Soul (psychƒì). The soul is also an energeia: it acts upon or actualizes its own thoughts and creates \\"a separate, material cosmos that is the living image of the spiritual or noetic Cosmos contained as a unified thought within the Intelligence\\". So it is the soul which perceives things in nature physically, which it understands to be reality. Soul in Plotinus plays a role similar to the potential intellect in Aristotelian terminology. *Lowest is matter. This was based largely upon Plotinus' reading of Plato, but also incorporated many Aristotelian concepts, including the unmoved mover as energeia.See and . The direct quote above comes from Moore. They also incorporated a theory of anamnesis, or knowledge coming from the past lives of our immortal souls, like that found in some of Plato's dialogues. Later Platonists distinguished a hierarchy of three separate manifestations of nous, like Numenius of Apamea had.Encyclopedia of The Study in Philosophy (1969), Vol. 5, article on subject \\"Nous\\", article author: G.B. Kerferd Notable later neoplatonists include Porphyry and Proclus. Medieval nous in religion Greek philosophy had an influence on the major religions that defined the Middle Ages, and one aspect of this was the concept of nous. =Gnosticism= Gnosticism was a late classical movement that incorporated ideas inspired by neoplatonism and neopythagoreanism, but which was more a syncretic religious movement than an accepted philosophical movement. Valentinus In Valentinianism, Nous is the first male Aeon. Together with his conjugate female Aeon, Aletheia (truth), he emanates from the Propator Bythos ( \\"Forefather Depths\\") and his co-eternal Ennoia ( \\"Thought\\") or Sigƒì ( \\"Silence\\"); and these four form the primordial Tetrad. Like the other male Aeons he is sometimes regarded as androgynous, including in himself the female Aeon who is paired with him. He is the Only Begotten; and is styled the Father, the Beginning of All, inasmuch as from him are derived immediately or mediately the remaining Aeons who complete the Ogdoad (eight), thence the Decad (ten), and thence the Dodecad (twelve); in all, thirty Aeons constitute the Pleroma. He alone is capable of knowing the Propator; but when he desired to impart like knowledge to the other Aeons, was withheld from so doing by Sigƒì. When Sophia (\\"Wisdom\\"), youngest Aeon of the thirty, was brought into peril by her yearning after this knowledge, Nous was foremost of the Aeons in interceding for her. From him, or through him from the Propator, Horos was sent to restore her. After her restoration, Nous, according to the providence of the Propator, produced another pair, Christ and the Holy Spirit, \\"in order to give fixity and steadfastness () to the Pleroma.\\" For this Christ teaches the Aeons to be content to know that the Propator is in himself incomprehensible, and can be perceived only through the Only Begotten (Nous).Irenaeus, On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis, I. i. 1-5Hippolytus of Rome, Refutation of All Heresies, vi. 29-31; Theodoret, Haer. Fab. i. 7. Basilides A similar conception of Nous appears in the later teaching of the Basilideans, according to which he is the first begotten of the Unbegotten Father, and himself the parent of Logos, from whom emanate successively Phronesis, Sophia, and Dunamis. But in this teaching, Nous is identified with Christ, is named Jesus, is sent to save those that believe, and returns to Him who sent him, after a Passion which is apparent only, Simon of Cyrene being substituted for him on the cross.Iren. I. xxiv. 4; Theod. H. E. i. 4. It is probable, however, that Nous had a place in the original system of Basilides himself; for his Ogdoad, \\"the great Archon of the universe, the ineffable\\"Hipp. vi. 25. is apparently made up of the five members named by Irenaeus (as above), together with two whom we find in Clement of Alexandria,Clement of Alexandria, Strom. iv. 25. Dikaiosyne and Eirene, added to the originating Father. Simon Magus The antecedent of these systems is that of Simon,Hipp. vi. 12 ff.; Theod. I. i. of whose six \\"roots\\" emanating from the Unbegotten Fire, Nous is first. The correspondence of these \\"roots\\" with the first six Aeons that Valentinus derives from Bythos, is noted by Hippolytus.Hipp. vi. 20. Simon says in his Apophasis Megalƒì,Ap. Hipp. vi. 18. To Nous and Epinoia correspond Heaven and Earth, in the list given by Simon of the six material counterparts of his six emanations. The identity of this list with the six material objects alleged by HerodotusHerodotus, i. to be worshipped by the Persians, together with the supreme place given by Simon to Fire as the primordial power, leads us to look to Iran for the origin of these systems in one aspect. In another, they connect themselves with the teaching of Pythagoras and of Plato. Gospel of Mary According to the Gospel of Mary, Jesus himself articulates the essence of Nous: =Medieval Islamic philosophy= During the Middle Ages, philosophy itself was in many places seen as opposed to the prevailing monotheistic religions, Islam, Christianity and Judaism. The strongest philosophical tradition for some centuries was amongst Islamic philosophers, who later came to strongly influence the late medieval philosophers of western Christendom, and the Jewish diaspora in the Mediterranean area. While there were earlier Muslim philosophers such as Al Kindi, chronologically the three most influential concerning the intellect were Al Farabi, Avicenna, and finally Averroes, a westerner who lived in Spain and was highly influential in the late Middle Ages amongst Jewish and Christian philosophers. Al Farabi The exact precedents of Al Farabi's influential philosophical scheme, in which nous (Arabic  øaql) plays an important role, are no longer perfectly clear because of the great loss of texts in the Middle Ages which he would have had access to. He was apparently innovative in at least some points. He was clearly influenced by the same late classical world as neoplatonism, neopythagoreanism, but exactly how is less clear. Plotinus, Themistius and Alexander of Aphrodisias are generally accepted to have been influences. However while these three all placed the active intellect \\"at or near the top of the hierarchy of being\\", Al Farabi was clear in making it the lowest ranking in a series of distinct transcendental intelligences. He is the first known person to have done this in a clear way.Davidson pp.12-14. One possible inspiration mentioned in a commentary of Aristotle's De Anima attributed to John Philoponus is a philosopher named Marinus, who was probably a student of Proclus. He in any case designated the active intellect to be angelic or daimonic, rather than the creator itself. He was also the first philosopher known to have assumed the existence of a causal hierarchy of celestial spheres, and the incorporeal intelligences parallel to those spheres.Davidson p.18 and p.45, which states \\"Within the translunar region, Aristotle recognized no causal relationship in what we may call the vertical plane; he did not recognize a causality that runs down through the series of incorporeal movers. And in the horizontal plane, that is, from each intelligence to the corresponding sphere, he recognized causality only in respect to motion, not in respect to existence.\\" Al Farabi also fitted an explanation of prophecy into this scheme, in two levels. According to Davidson (p. 59): > The lower of the two levels, labeled specifically as \\"prophecy\\" (nubuwwa), > is enjoyed by men who have not yet perfected their intellect, whereas the > higher, which Alfarabi sometimes specifically names \\"revelation\\" (w-·∏•-y), > comes exclusively to those who stand at the stage of acquired intellect. This happens in the imagination (Arabic mutakhayyila; Greek phantasia), a faculty of the mind already described by Aristotle, which al Farabi described as serving the rational part of the soul (Arabic  øaql; Greek nous). This faculty of imagination stores sense perceptions (ma·∏•s≈´sƒÅt), disassembles or recombines them, creates figurative or symbolic images (mu·∏•ƒÅkƒÅt) of them which then appear in dreams, visualizes present and predicted events in a way different from conscious deliberation (rawiyya). This is under the influence, according to Al Farabi, of the active intellect. Theoretical truth can only be received by this faculty in a figurative or symbolic form, because the imagination is a physical capability and can not receive theoretical information in a proper abstract form. This rarely comes in a waking state, but more often in dreams. The lower type of prophecy is the best possible for the imaginative faculty, but the higher type of prophecy requires not only a receptive imagination, but also the condition of an \\"acquired intellect\\", where the human nous is in \\"conjunction\\" with the active intellect in the sense of God. Such a prophet is also a philosopher. When a philosopher-prophet has the necessary leadership qualities, he becomes philosopher-king.Davidson pp.58-61. Avicenna In terms of cosmology, according to Davidson (p. 82) \\"Avicenna's universe has a structure virtually identical with the structure of Alfarabi's\\" but there are differences in details. As in Al Farabi, there are several levels of intellect, intelligence or nous, each of the higher ones being associated with a celestial sphere. Avicenna however details three different types of effect which each of these higher intellects has, each \\"thinks\\" both the necessary existence and the possible being of the intelligence one level higher. And each \\"emanates\\" downwards the body and soul of its own celestial sphere, and also the intellect at the next lowest level. The active intellect, as in Alfarabi, is the last in the chain. Avicenna sees active intellect as the cause not only of intelligible thought and the forms in the \\"sublunar\\" world we people live, but also the matter. (In other words, three effects.)Davidson ch. 4. Concerning the workings of the human soul, Avicenna, like Al Farabi, sees the \\"material intellect\\" or potential intellect as something that is not material. He believed the soul was incorporeal, and the potential intellect was a disposition of it which was in the soul from birth. As in Al Farabi there are two further stages of potential for thinking, which are not yet actual thinking, first the mind acquires the most basic intelligible thoughts which we can not think in any other way, such as \\"the whole is greater than the part\\", then comes a second level of derivative intelligible thoughts which could be thought. Concerning the actualization of thought, Avicenna applies the term \\"to two different things, to actual human thought, irrespective of the intellectual progress a man has made, and to actual thought when human intellectual development is complete\\", as in Al Farabi.Davidson p.86 When reasoning in the sense of deriving conclusions from syllogisms, Avicenna says people are using a physical \\"cogitative\\" faculty (mufakkira, fikra) of the soul, which can err. The human cogitative faculty is the same as the \\"compositive imaginative faculty (mutakhayyila) in reference to the animal soul\\".From ShifƒÅ': De Anima 45, translation by Davidson p.96. But some people can use \\"insight\\" to avoid this step and derive conclusions directly by conjoining with the active intellect.Davidson pp.102 Once a thought has been learned in a soul, the physical faculties of sense perception and imagination become unnecessary, and as a person acquires more thoughts, their soul becomes less connected to their body.Davidson p.104 For Avicenna, different from the normal Aristotelian position, all of the soul is by nature immortal. But the level of intellectual development does affect the type of afterlife that the soul can have. Only a soul which has reached the highest type of conjunction with the active intellect can form a perfect conjunction with it after the death of the body, and this is a supreme eudaimonia. Lesser intellectual achievement means a less happy or even painful afterlife.Davidson pp.111-115. Concerning prophecy, Avicenna identifies a broader range of possibilities which fit into this model, which is still similar to that of Al Farabi.Davidson p.123. Averroes Averroes came to be regarded even in Europe as \\"the Commentator\\" to \\"the Philosopher\\", Aristotle, and his study of the questions surrounding the nous were very influential amongst Jewish and Christian philosophers, with some aspects being quite controversial. According to Herbert Davidson, Averroes' doctrine concerning nous can be divided into two periods. In the first, neoplatonic emanationism, not found in the original works of Aristotle, was combined with a naturalistic explanation of the human material intellect. \\"It also insists on the material intellect's having an active intellect as a direct object of thought and conjoining with the active intellect, notions never expressed in the Aristotelian canon.\\" It was this presentation which Jewish philosophers such as Moses Narboni and Gersonides understood to be Averroes'. In the later model of the universe, which was transmitted to Christian philosophers, Averroes \\"dismisses emanationism and explains the generation of living beings in the sublunar world naturalistically, all in the name of a more genuine Aristotelianism. Yet it abandons the earlier naturalistic conception of the human material intellect and transforms the material intellect into something wholly un-Aristotelian, a single transcendent entity serving all mankind. It nominally salvages human conjunction with the active intellect, but in words that have little content.\\"Davidson p.356 This position, that humankind shares one active intellect, was taken up by Parisian philosophers such as Siger of Brabant, but also widely rejected by philosophers such as Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Ramon Lull, and Duns Scotus. Despite being widely considered heretical, the position was later defended by many more European philosophers including John of Jandun, who was the primary link bringing this doctrine from Paris to Bologna. After him this position continued to be defended and also rejected by various writers in northern Italy. In the 16th century it finally became a less common position after the renewal of an \\"Alexandrian\\" position based on that of Alexander of Aphrodisias, associated with Pietro Pomponazzi.Davidson ch.7 =Christianity= The Christian New Testament makes mention of the nous or noos, generally translated in modern English as \\"mind\\", but also showing a link to God's will or law: *, refers to the law (nomos) of God which is the law in the writer's nous, as opposed to the law of sin which is in the body. *, demands Christians should not conform to this world, but continuously be transformed by the renewing of their nous, so as to be able to determine what God‚Äôs will is. *-. Discusses \\"speaking in tongues\\" and says that a person who speaks in tongues that they can not understand should prefer to also have understanding (nous), and it is better for the listeners also to be able to understand. *-. Discusses how non-Christians have a worthless nous, while Christians should seek to renew the spirit (pneuma) of their nous. *. Uses the term to refer to being troubled of mind. *: \\"here is the nous which has wisdom\\". In the writings of the Christian fathers a sound or pure nous is considered essential to the cultivation of wisdom.See, for example, the many references to nous and the necessity of its purification in the writings of the Philokalia Philosophers influencing western Christianity While philosophical works were not commonly read or taught in the early Middle Ages in most of Europe, the works of authors like Boethius and Augustine of Hippo formed an important exception. Both were influenced by neoplatonism, and were amongst the older works that were still known in the time of the Carolingian Renaissance, and the beginnings of Scholasticism. In his early years Augustine was heavily influenced by Manichaeism and afterwards by the Neoplatonism of Plotinus. After his conversion to Christianity and baptism (387), he developed his own approach to philosophy and theology, accommodating a variety of methods and different perspectives. March 2002 edition: . Augustine used Neoplatonism selectively. He used both the neoplatonic Nous, and the Platonic Form of the Good (or \\"The Idea of the Good\\") as equivalent terms for the Christian God, or at least for one particular aspect of God. For example, God, nous, can act directly upon matter, and not only through souls, and concerning the souls through which it works upon the world experienced by humanity, some are treated as angels. Scholasticism becomes more clearly defined much later, as the peculiar native type of philosophy in medieval catholic Europe. In this period, Aristotle became \\"the Philosopher\\", and scholastic philosophers, like their Jewish and Muslim contemporaries, studied the concept of the intellectus on the basis not only of Aristotle, but also late classical interpreters like Augustine and Boethius. A European tradition of new and direct interpretations of Aristotle developed which was eventually strong enough to argue with partial success against some of the interpretations of Aristotle from the Islamic world, most notably Averroes' doctrine of their being one \\"active intellect\\" for all humanity. Notable \\"Catholic\\" (as opposed to Averroist) Aristotelians included Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas, the founder of Thomism, which exists to this day in various forms. Concerning the nous, Thomism agrees with those Aristotelians who insist that the intellect is immaterial and separate from any bodily organs, but as per Christian doctrine, the whole of the human soul is immortal, not only the intellect. Eastern Orthodox The human nous in Eastern Orthodox Christianity is the \\"eye of the heart or soul\\" or the \\"mind of the heart\\".Neptic Monasticism\\"What is the Human Nous?\\" by John Romanides\\"Before embarking on this study, the reader is asked to absorb a few Greek terms for which there is no English word that would not be imprecise or misleading. Chief among these is NOUS, which refers to the \`eye of the heart' and is often translated as mind or intellect. Here we keep the Greek word NOUS throughout. The adjective related to it is NOETIC (noeros).\\" Orthodox Psychotherapy Section The Knowledge of God according to St. Gregory Palamas by Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos published by Birth of Theotokos Monastery, Greece (January 1, 2005) The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, SVS Press, 1997. () James Clarke & Co Ltd, 1991. () pgs 200-201 The soul of man, is created by God in His image, man's soul is intelligent and noetic. Saint Thalassius of Syria wrote that God created beings \\"with a capacity to receive the Spirit and to attain knowledge of Himself; He has brought into existence the senses and sensory perception to serve such beings\\". Eastern Orthodox Christians hold that God did this by creating mankind with intelligence and noetic faculties.G.E.H; Sherrard, Philip; Ware, Kallistos (Timothy). The Philokalia, Vol. 4 Pg432 Nous the highest facility in man, through which - provided it is purified - he knows God or the inner essences or principles (q.v.) of created things by means of direct apprehension or spiritual perception. Unlike the dianoia or reason (q.v.), from which it must be carefully distinguished, the intellect does not function by formulating abstract concepts and then arguing on this basis to a conclusion reached through deductive reasoning, but it understands divine truth by means of immediate experience, intuition or 'simple cognition' (the term used by St Isaac the Syrian). The intellect dwells in the 'depths of the soul'; it constitutes the innermost aspect of the heart (St Diadochos, 79, 88: in our translation, vol. i, pp.. 280, 287). The intellect is the organ of contemplation (q.v.), the 'eye of the heart' (Makarian Homilies). Human reasoning is not enough: there will always remain an \\"irrational residue\\" which escapes analysis and which can not be expressed in concepts: it is this unknowable depth of things, that which constitutes their true, indefinable essence that also reflects the origin of things in God. In Eastern Christianity it is by faith or intuitive truth that this component of an object‚Äôs existence is grasped.The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, by Vladimir Lossky SVS Press, 1997, pg 33 (). James Clarke & Co Ltd, 1991, pg 71 (). Though God through his energies draws us to him, his essence remains inaccessible. The operation of faith being the means of free will by which mankind faces the future or unknown, these noetic operations contained in the concept of insight or noesis.Anthropological turn in Christian theology: an Orthodox perspective by Sergey S. Horujy Faith (pistis) is therefore sometimes used interchangeably with noesis in Eastern Christianity. Angels have intelligence and nous, whereas men have reason, both logos and dianoia, nous and sensory perception. This follows the idea that man is a microcosm and an expression of the whole creation or macrocosmos. The human nous was darkened after the Fall of Man (which was the result of the rebellion of reason against the nous),\\"The Illness and cure of the soul\\" Metropolitan Hierotheos of Nafpaktos but after the purification (healing or correction) of the nous (achieved through ascetic practices like hesychasm), the human nous (the \\"eye of the heart\\") will see God's uncreated Light (and feel God's uncreated love and beauty, at which point the nous will start the unceasing prayer of the heart) and become illuminated, allowing the person to become an orthodox theologian.The Relationship between Prayer and Theology \\"Jesus Christ - The Life of the World\\", John S. Romanides In this belief, the soul is created in the image of God. Since God is Trinitarian, Mankind is Nous, reason, both logos and dianoia, and Spirit. The same is held true of the soul (or heart): it has nous, word and spirit. To understand this better first an understanding of Saint Gregory Palamas's teaching that man is a representation of the trinitarian mystery should be addressed. This holds that God is not meant in the sense that the Trinity should be understood anthropomorphically, but man is to be understood in a triune way. Or, that the Trinitarian God is not to be interpreted from the point of view of individual man, but man is interpreted on the basis of the Trinitarian God. And this interpretation is revelatory not merely psychological and human. This means that it is only when a person is within the revelation, as all the saints lived, that he can grasp this understanding completely (see theoria). The second presupposition is that mankind has and is composed of nous, word and spirit like the trinitarian mode of being. Man's nous, word and spirit are not hypostases or individual existences or realities, but activities or energies of the soul - whereas in the case with God or the Persons of the Holy Trinity, each are indeed hypostases. So these three components of each individual man are 'inseparable from one another' but they do not have a personal character\\" when in speaking of the being or ontology that is mankind. The nous as the eye of the soul, which some Fathers also call the heart, is the centre of man and is where true (spiritual) knowledge is validated. This is seen as true knowledge which is \\"implanted in the nous as always co-existing with it\\".Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos (2005), Orthodox Psychotherapy , Tr. Esther E. Cunningham Williams (Birth of Theotokos Monastery, Greece), Early modern philosophy The so- called \\"early modern\\" philosophers of western Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries established arguments which led to the establishment of modern science as a methodical approach to improve the welfare of humanity by learning to control nature. As such, speculation about metaphysics, which cannot be used for anything practical, and which can never be confirmed against the reality we experience, started to be deliberately avoided, especially according to the so-called \\"empiricist\\" arguments of philosophers such as Bacon, Hobbes, Locke and Hume. The Latin motto \\"nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu\\" (nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses) has been described as the \\"guiding principle of empiricism\\" in the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy. (This was in fact an old Aristotelian doctrine, which they took up, but as discussed above Aristotelians still believed that the senses on their own were not enough to explain the mind.) These philosophers explain the intellect as something developed from experience of sensations, being interpreted by the brain in a physical way, and nothing else, which means that absolute knowledge is impossible. For Bacon, Hobbes and Locke, who wrote in both English and Latin, \\"intellectus\\" was translated as \\"understanding\\". Far from seeing it as secure way to perceive the truth about reality, Bacon, for example, actually named the intellectus in his Novum Organum, and the pro≈ìmium to his Great Instauration, as a major source of wrong conclusions, because it is biased in many ways, for example towards over-generalizing. For this reason, modern science should be methodical, in order not to be misled by the weak human intellect. He felt that lesser known Greek philosophers such as Democritus \\"who did not suppose a mind or reason in the frame of things\\", have been arrogantly dismissed because of Aristotelianism leading to a situation in his time wherein \\"the search of the physical causes hath been neglected, and passed in silence\\".Bacon Advancement of Learning II.VII.7 The intellect or understanding was the subject of Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding. These philosophers also tended not to emphasize the distinction between reason and intellect, describing the peculiar universal or abstract definitions of human understanding as being man-made and resulting from reason itself. and also see De Homine X. Hume even questioned the distinctness or peculiarity of human understanding and reason, compared to other types of associative or imaginative thinking found in some other animals. In modern science during this time, Newton is sometimes described as more empiricist compared to Leibniz. On the other hand, into modern times some philosophers have continued to propose that the human mind has an in-born (\\"a priori\\") ability to know the truth conclusively, and these philosophers have needed to argue that the human mind has direct and intuitive ideas about nature, and this means it can not be limited entirely to what can be known from sense perception. Amongst the early modern philosophers, some such as Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, and Kant, tend to be distinguished from the empiricists as rationalists, and to some extent at least some of them are called idealists, and their writings on the intellect or understanding present various doubts about empiricism, and in some cases they argued for positions which appear more similar to those of medieval and classical philosophers. The first in this series of modern rationalists, Descartes, is credited with defining a \\"mind-body problem\\" which is a major subject of discussion for university philosophy courses. According to the presentation his 2nd Meditation, the human mind and body are different in kind, and while Descartes agrees with Hobbes for example that the human body works like a clockwork mechanism, and its workings include memory and imagination, the real human is the thinking being, a soul, which is not part of that mechanism. Descartes explicitly refused to divide this soul into its traditional parts such as intellect and reason, saying that these things were indivisible aspects of the soul. Descartes was therefore a dualist, but very much in opposition to traditional Aristotelian dualism. In his 6th Meditation he deliberately uses traditional terms and states that his active faculty of giving ideas to his thought must be corporeal, because the things perceived are clearly external to his own thinking and corporeal, while his passive faculty must be incorporeal (unless God is deliberately deceiving us, and then in this case the active faculty would be from God). This is the opposite of the traditional explanation found for example in Alexander of Aphrodisias and discussed above, for whom the passive intellect is material, while the active intellect is not. One result is that in many Aristotelian conceptions of the nous, for example that of Thomas Aquinas, the senses are still a source of all the intellect's conceptions. However, with the strict separation of mind and body proposed by Descartes, it becomes possible to propose that there can be thought about objects never perceived with the body's senses, such as a thousand sided geometrical figure. Gassendi objected to this distinction between the imagination and the intellect in Descartes.The Philosophical Works of Descartes Vol. II, 1968, translated by Haldane and Ross, p.190 Hobbes also objected, and according to his own philosophical approach asserted that the \\"triangle in the mind comes from the triangle we have seen\\" and \\"essence in so far as it is distinguished from existence is nothing else than a union of names by means of the verb is\\". Descartes, in his reply to this objection insisted that this traditional distinction between essence and existence is \\"known to all\\".The Philosophical Works of Descartes Vol. II, 1968, translated by Haldane and Ross, p.77 His contemporary Blaise Pascal, criticised him in similar words to those used by Plato's Socrates concerning Anaxagoras, discussed above, saying that \\"I cannot forgive Descartes; in all his philosophy, Descartes did his best to dispense with God. But Descartes could not avoid prodding God to set the world in motion with a snap of his lordly fingers; after that, he had no more use for God.\\"Think Exist on Blaise Pascal . Retrieved 12 Feb. 2009. Descartes argued that when the intellect does a job of helping people interpret what they perceive, not with the help of an intellect which enters from outside, but because each human mind comes into being with innate God-given ideas, more similar then, to Plato's theory of anamnesis, only not requiring reincarnation. Apart from such examples as the geometrical definition of a triangle, another example is the idea of God, according to the 3rd Meditation. Error, according to the 4th Meditation, comes about because people make judgments about things which are not in the intellect or understanding. This is possible because the human will, being free, is not limited like the human intellect. Spinoza, though considered a Cartesian and a rationalist, rejected Cartesian dualism and idealism. In his \\"pantheistic\\" approach, explained for example in his Ethics, God is the same as nature, the human intellect is just the same as the human will. The divine intellect of nature is quite different from human intellect, because it is finite, but Spinoza does accept that the human intellect is a part of the infinite divine intellect. Leibniz, in comparison to the guiding principle of the empiricists described above, added some words nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu, nisi intellectus ipsi (\\"nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses\\" except the intellect itself). Despite being at the forefront of modern science, and modernist philosophy, in his writings he still referred to the active and passive intellect, a divine intellect, and the immortality of the active intellect. Berkeley, partly in reaction to Locke, also attempted to reintroduce an \\"immaterialism\\" into early modern philosophy (later referred to as \\"subjective idealism\\" by others). He argued that individuals can only know sensations and ideas of objects, not abstractions such as \\"matter\\", and that ideas depend on perceiving minds for their very existence. This belief later became immortalized in the dictum, esse est percipi (\\"to be is to be perceived\\"). As in classical and medieval philosophy, Berkeley believed understanding had to be explained by divine intervention, and that all our ideas are put in our mind by God. Hume accepted some of Berkeley's corrections of Locke, but in answer insisted, as had Bacon and Hobbes, that absolute knowledge is not possible, and that all attempts to show how it could be possible have logical problems. Hume's writings remain highly influential on all philosophy afterwards, and are for example considered by Kant to have shaken him from an intellectual slumber. Kant, a turning point in modern philosophy, agreed with some classical philosophers and Leibniz that the intellect itself, although it needed sensory experience for understanding to begin, needs something else in order to make sense of the incoming sense information. In his formulation the intellect (Verstand) has a priori or innate principles which it has before thinking even starts. Kant represents the starting point of German idealism and a new phase of modernity, while empiricist philosophy has also continued beyond Hume to the present day. More recent modern philosophy and science One of the results of the early modern philosophy has been the increasing creation of specialist fields of science, in areas that were once considered part of philosophy, and infant cognitive development and perception now tend to be discussed more within the sciences of psychology and neuroscience than in philosophy. Modern mainstream thinking on the mind is not dualist, and sees anything innate in the mind as being a result of genetic and developmental factors which allow the mind to develop. Overall it accepts far less innate \\"knowledge\\" (or clear pre- dispositions to particular types of knowledge) than most of the classical and medieval theories derived from philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus and Al Farabi. Apart from discussions about the history of philosophical discussion on this subject, contemporary philosophical discussion concerning this point has continued concerning what the ethical implications are of the different alternatives still considered likely. Classical conceptions of nous are still discussed seriously in theology. There is also still discussion of classical nous in non-mainstream metaphysics or spiritualism, such as Noetics, promoted for example by the Institute of Noetic Sciences.

The organ is traditionally where a perfumer works on the composition of various perfumes, however the weighing and blending of perfume samples are now mainly done by technicians in larger flavour and fragrance companies. A perfumer is an expert on creating perfume compositions, sometimes referred to affectionately as a Nose (French: le nez) due to their fine sense of smell and skill in producing olfactory compositions. The perfumer is effectively an artist who is trained in depth on the concepts of fragrance aesthetics and who is capable of conveying abstract concepts and moods with fragrance compositions. At the most rudimentary level, a perfumer must have a keen knowledge of a large variety of fragrance ingredients and their smells, and be able to distinguish each of the fragrance ingredients whether alone or in combination with other fragrances. As well, they must know how each ingredient reveals itself through time with other ingredients. The job of the perfumer is very similar to that of flavourists, who compose smells and flavourants for many commercial food products. The practice of perfume-making has recently attracted academic interest among major research funding agencies. Training Most past perfumers did not undergo professional training in the art and many learned their craft as apprentices under another perfumer in their employment as a perfume technician (in charge of blending formulas) or chemist.These people were usually given a temporary job in the perfume industry. A direct entrance into the profession is rare and those who do typically enter it through family contacts. Such apprenticeships last around 3 years. Until recently, professional schools open to the public for training perfumers did not exist. In 1970 ISIPCA became the first school in perfumery. The candidates must endure a demanding entrance examination and must have taken university-level courses in organic chemistry. Since 1998 PerfumersWorld's perfumery school has offered formal and informal perfumer training through university courses at King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi Biotechnology faculty, at Chulalongkorn University Pharmacy faculty and through on-line courses and private workshops in the United States, UK, Dubai, Hong Kong, Germany, New Zealand and Thailand. More recently, in 2002, another perfumery school was born, the Grasse Institute of Perfumery (G.I.P). Similarly here, the ideal candidates must have a foundation in chemistry or pharmacy in order to be accepted as student perfumer (√©l√®ve perfumer). Givaudan, International Flavors and Fragrances (IFF) and Symrise have perfumery schools as part of their companies, but students must be employees of the company and must be recommended by their superiors for acceptance into the school. The University of Plymouth (UK) offers a BA (Bachelor of Arts) course in Business & Perfumery. Employment Most perfumers are employed by several large fragrance corporations in the world including Mane, Robertet, Firmenich, IFF, Givaudan, Takasago, and Symrise. Some perfumers work exclusively for a perfume house or in their own company, but these cases are not as common. The perfumer typically begins a perfume project with a brief by the perfumer's employer or an outside customer. The customers to the perfumer or their employers, are typically fashion houses or large corporations of various industries. Each brief will contain the specifications for the desired perfume, and will describe in often poetic or abstract terms what the perfume should smell like or what feelings it should evoke in those who smell it, along with a maximum per litre price of the perfume oil concentrate. This allowance, along with the intended application of the perfume, will determine what aromatic ingredients will be used in the perfume composition. The perfumer will then go through the process of blending multiple perfume mixtures and will attempt to capture the desired feelings specified in the brief. After presenting the perfume mixtures to the customers, the perfumer may \\"win\\" the brief with their approval. They proceed to work with the customer, often with the direction provided by a panel or artistic director, which guides and edits the modifications on the composition of the perfume. This process typically spans several months to several years, going over many iterations and may involve cultural and public surveys to tailor a perfume to a particular market. The perfume composition will then be either used to enhance another product as a functional fragrance (shampoos, make-up, detergents, car interiors, etc.) or marketed and sold directly to the public as a fine fragrance. Alternatively, the perfumer may simply be inspired to create a perfume and produce something that later becomes marketable or wins a brief. This is more common in smaller or independent perfume houses.

It is the busiest railway station in Scotland north of the major cities of Glasgow and Edinburgh. It is located on Guild Street in the city centre, next to Union Square. The station is managed by Abellio ScotRail. Inter-city, regional, local and sleeper train services are provided to all parts of Great Britain by Abellio ScotRail, Caledonian Sleeper, CrossCountry and London North Eastern Railway. The station is the northern terminus of the Dundee‚ÄìAberdeen line and the southern terminus of the Aberdeen‚ÄìInverness line.  History  A 1913 Railway Clearing House Junction Diagram showing railways in the vicinity of Aberdeen (present station shown here as JOINT PASS. STA.) =Pre- nationalisation= The station currently standing was built as Aberdeen Joint Station between 1913 and 1916, replacing an 1867 structure of the same name, on the same site. The station and the new Denburn Valley Line enabled the main line from the south and the commuter line from Deeside to connect with the line from the north. The lines from the south had previously terminated at the adjacent Aberdeen Guild Street. Even this had not been Aberdeen's first railway station, that distinction belonging to a previous terminus a short way south at Ferryhill. After the construction of the Joint Station, Guild Street Station became a goods station. Some of its tracks remain, but the vast majority of the site was cleared in 2005. Prior to the construction of the Joint Station, lines from the north had terminated at Aberdeen Waterloo, a short but inconvenient distance along the edge of the harbour. This too became a goods station after the construction of the Joint Station. There is no longer a station at the site, but a goods service runs approximately weekly to industrial operations there. The Waterloo tracks join the north‚Äìsouth connecting Denburn Valley Line in the Kittybrewster area of the city, where the very first terminus of the lines from the north had briefly been, before extension and the building of the Waterloo Station. As far north as Inverurie, these follow the route of the Aberdeenshire Canal which had been purchased and filled in by the Great North of Scotland Railway. =Nationalisation and privatisation= The entrance to the station, seen in 2006, before redevelopment as part of Union Square. The Station Hotel can be seen in the background.As a result of the grouping of railway companies under the Railways Act 1921, Aberdeen was shared by the London and North Eastern Railway and the London Midland and Scottish Railway, each company running the station for a year and then handing its administration to the other company. At nationalisation in 1948, it then became part of British Rail. As part of the changes during this period which saw a general contraction of railway services in the UK, some services were cut in the 1960s. These included those running north to Peterhead and Ellon as well as the Deeside Line. Suburban services were heavily reduced and the grand suburban ticket office, located on the corner of Guild Street and Bridge Street, was closed. It now houses a hair and beauty salon. The number of platforms at the station were also reduced considerably in the early 1970s, from the thirteen of the late 1950s/early 1960s down to just seven by 1973.\\"Aberdeen ‚Äì End of the Great North End\\" McIntrye, John; Railscot article January 2007. Retrieved 8 April 2014 This rationalisation process saw the removal of all of the north end bay platforms to allow for redevelopment of that part of the site. However, significant improvements under British Rail included introduction of InterCity 125 high- speed service to London and other major destinations, and introduction of other new rolling stock. Other improvements included a new Travel Centre opened in 1978 and under British Rail's regional brand ScotRail, a major station renovation was completed in the 1980s. The station was also resignalled around this time, with two more bay platforms (1 & 2) taken out of use along with the former through platforms 8 & 9\\\\. This left just five platforms (3‚Äì7) in regular use ‚Äì the layout that remains in operation to this day. The two former bay platforms remain in place and are used as sidings. The former double track through platforms 8 and 9 has since been singled, but the platform faces remain. At privatisation in the mid-1990s, ownership of the station passed to Railtrack (along with all stations and other infrastructure in England, Wales and Scotland), while day-to-day management passed to the train-operating franchisee ScotRail, a division of National Express. Following the quasi-nationalisation of railway infrastructure in the early 2000s, the station is now owned by Network Rail. In 2004, the train-operating franchise and station management were taken over by First ScotRail. ScotRail continue to operate trains but the station and all signage is now branded with the \\"ScotRail\\" logo, typeface and rolling-stock livery. Signage at Aberdeen station in May 2012, showing National Rail double-arrow logo =Listed building= Historic Environment Scotland designate the current building and road overbridge as Category A, noting that it was the last major station to be completed in Scotland in the period 1913 - 20. =Redevelopment as part of Union Square= The station had gradually become run-down in the last years of British Rail. In the late 2000s, the railway station and bus station were included in the extensive Union Square development, primarily sited on an abandoned railway goods yard east of the station. As part of this, the railway station was comprehensively refurbished. The original sandstone station building became the centrepiece of a covered plaza for the new shopping and entertainment complex, while a granite-faced building was constructed to house station offices, a new Travel Centre, and other facilities. The car park at the front of the station was replaced by a public square providing pedestrian access to the station and Union Square. In addition, direct access was provided from the station concourse to Union Square and through to the bus station, creating a completely covered transport interchange. The refurbished station opened in 2009 followed by Union Square itself some months later. = Future developments = Plans to relocate the ticket office and passenger waiting room, as well as upgrades to the taxi rank and concourse, were approved by Aberdeen City Council in December 2018, with work due to start in spring 2019. Under a separate scheme, the vacant Atholl House building to the north of the station is to be demolished, making way for the construction of a public square, hotel and student accommodation, and improved connections between the city's main Union Street and the station. This development could allow the currently disused platforms 8 and 9 to be brought back into service. As of early 2019, the station's glass roof is undergoing replacement with polycarbonate panels as part of a ¬£9 million upgrade. In June 2020, ScotRail announced that it would proceed with the modifications to the ticket office, waiting room, and taxi rank as soon as it was safe to do so following the coronavirus pandemic. There are no plans to reinstate the platforms yet.  Station services  Concourse at Aberdeen station =Passenger facilities= There is a staffed travel centre providing ticket office and information facilities (e.g. timetables), although it is not open in the late evening and closes before the last trains have departed. There are also automatic ticket machines outside this office and in the main concourse. Tickets purchased in advance (e.g. on the internet) can be collected from any of these machines. The entrance to the ScotRail first-class lounge is located inside the ticket office. Luggage trolleys are provided for travellers with baggage and a left- luggage facility is available with access from the front forecourt of the station. A waiting room is available on the main concourse, as is a branch of WHSmith selling books, magazines, stationery and confectionery. There is also a pub and caf√©. A wide range of other shopping and eating facilities are located in the Union Square complex which can be accessed directly through the concourse and is integrated with the station building. These include Boots, Costa Coffee, Starbucks, Marks & Spencer Simply Food and a range of other shops and restaurants. Unlike the travel centre, facilities at Union Square open late into the evening and also include ATM machines, through-access to the city's bus station, and a hotel operated by Jurys Inn. The original Station Hotel (now privately operated) as formerly operated by the Great North of Scotland Railway is open and located on Guild Street directly opposite the station. There are toilet facilities accessible from the concourse, in addition to toilet facilities in the caf√© (free to customers), on most trains (free to passengers) and in Union Square. =Parking and onward transport= Medium-term parking is available in the adjoining College Street Car Park (with access only from College Street) and there are also a small number of free spaces which offer parking for 20 minutes only in a separate section of the car park inside the station itself. Taxis are available from a stand within the station concourse. Regional and national bus services (including buses to Aberdeen Airport) depart from Aberdeen bus station, which is located on the other side of the adjoining Union Square shopping and entertainment complex. It is possible to walk directly from the concourse, through Union Square and to the bus station without entering the open air. This option is useful in winter and in periods of bad weather.  Rail services and train operators  Automated ticket barriers operate at all platforms but are left open when staff are not present. All scheduled services are operated by diesel-powered rolling stock.

In 1959 he was ordained deacon in the Church of England, becoming a priest in 1960. After short periods as a curate in the North of England, and as Vice-Principal of Westcott House, Cupitt was elected to a Fellowship and appointed Dean at Emmanuel College, Cambridge late in 1965. Since then he has remained at the college. In 1968 he was appointed to a university teaching post in philosophy of religion, a position in which he continued until his retirement for health reasons in 1996. At that time he proceeded to a Life Fellowship at Emmanuel College, which remains his base today. In the early 1990s he stopped officiating at public worship and in 2008 he ceased to be a communicant member of the church. Although he has been a priest, he is better known as a writer, broadcaster and populariser of innovative theological ideas. He has written 40 books‚Äîwhich have been translated into Dutch, Persian, Polish, Korean, Portuguese, Danish, German and Chinese‚Äîas well as chapters in more than 30 multi-authored volumes. Cupitt came to the British public's attention in 1984 with his BBC television series The Sea of Faith, in which orthodox Christian beliefs were challenged. The series took its title from Matthew Arnold's poem Dover Beach, which reflected on the decline of faith. Cupitt is currently a key figure in the Sea of Faith Network, a group of spiritual \\"explorers\\" (based in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia) who share Cupitt's concerns. In his writings Cupitt sometimes describes himself as Christian non-realist, by which he means that he follows certain spiritual practices and attempts to live by ethical standards traditionally associated with Christianity but without believing in the actual existence of the underlying metaphysical entities (such as \\"Christ\\" and \\"God\\"). He calls this way of being a non-realist Christian \\"solar living\\". Books (partial list) *Crisis of Moral Authority: The Dethronement of Christianity, Lutterworth Press, 1972, *Who was Jesus?

For Cupitt, the abandonment of religion has also been aided by technological advances and the growing number of sources of authority. Finally, he goes on to argue that many people still hold on to their religious beliefs purely out of 'ethnic loyalty', and that, despite people's best efforts, religion will continue to liquidate.

Created by Constance M. Burge and produced by Aaron Spelling, it was the first-one hour program to air on The WB network. Savannah starred Jamie Luner, Robyn Lively and Shannon Sturges as a trio of friends challenged by outside forces and each other. The first season of the series was The WB's most successful program at the time, but the show was cancelled after two seasons. Plot Set in the southern city of Savannah, Georgia, the series revolves around three female friends: naive rich girl Reese Burton (Shannon Sturges), noble Lane McKenzie (Robyn Lively), and scheming bad girl Peyton Richards (Jamie Luner). Lane had previously left Savannah after graduating from college to become a successful journalist in New York City, but returns for the wedding of her childhood best friend Reese to Travis Peterson (George Eads). Finding out that her apartment in New York has been burglarized, Lane tries to collect on an inheritance, but discovers that Travis has stolen every penny of it. Travis has also, as Reese is devastated to discover, been having an affair with a girl he calls \\"Bunny\\", who is actually Peyton, Reese's so-called friend and daughter of the Burton family's maid. Peyton envies Reese's wealth and is keen to marry for money. Travis is soon found dead, and the first season revolves around the whodunit murder mystery and subsequent court case. Considerable intrigue surrounds the machinations of Tom Massick (Paul Satterfield), a stranger with a score to settle, as well as the identity of Peyton's father, who turns out to be Reese's father Edward (Ray Wise), making Peyton and Reese half-sisters; as well as . Cassandra \\"Cassie\\" Wheeler (Alexia Robinson), longtime friend of the three other women, joined the cast in the second season, and Eads returned as Travis's identical twin Nick.

Sam Lucas Episodes =Series overview= =Season 1 (1996)= =Season 2 (1996‚Äì97)= Development Savannah was the first drama series produced for The WB, which had been launched in January 1995 and featured primarily sitcoms. Garth Ancier, president of the WB's entertainment division, said, \\"We believe there's a tremendous opportunity to attract female viewers with a one- hour drama opposite the neworks' three competing two-hour movies, much the way Fox has attracted a male-oriented audience with its one-hour comedy block ... on Sunday nights.\\" Executive producer Aaron Spelling called Savannah \\"a young Dynasty\\", referring the 1980s prime time soap also produced by Spelling, as well as \\"a little touch of Gone with the Wind if it were done in 1996.\\" The series focuses on three young women who share a life long friendship but as adults have little in common. Reese Burton is described as a \\"rich and pampered\\", yet naive, woman \\"who remains unselfish despite her wealth and privilege.\\" Lane MacKenzie is perky and levelheaded, and \\"remains loyal to her friends despite a run of bad luck.\\" Peyton Richards is the \\"bad girl\\", and a \\"street-wise\\" woman who is jealous of Reese's wealth and pending marriage, and whose \\"impetuous nature seems certain to test the bonds of friendship‚Äîespecially when she goes after her friend Reese's fianc√© [Travis].\\" Travis, who turns out to be \\"the nastiest guy this side of J. R. Ewing\\", is also \\"the most multifaceted liar in the world\\" while pretending to be nice. The Deseret News notes that Reese's father [Edward] loves his daughter very, very much but has a secret; the mysterious [Tom] falls in love with Reese very, very much but has a secret; [and] upright cop [Dean] really loves Lane from point one, but he has two secrets. Locations and filming The show was filmed entirely on location in the U.S. state of Georgia. Initially, exterior scenes were shot in both Savannah and Atlanta, Georgia. Locations and landmarks featured included the Eugene Talmadge Memorial Bridge, Forsyth Park, River Street, and Bonaventure Cemetery. Towards the end of season two, scenes were no longer filmed at the exterior locations for many of the show's main sets. These were replaced by stock establishing-shot footage and scenes were filmed entirely in Atlanta. Broadcast history Savannahs first season was broadcast between January 21, 1996 and April 7, 1996. The first two episodes were shown together as a two-hour Saturday \\"sneak preview\\" of the upcoming series. The remaining season one episodes were shown on Sunday nights. The show was the most successful program on The WB at the time, and by April 1996 had been renewed for a second season. During its second season, Savannah was moved to Monday nights, the 22 second season episodes broadcast between August 26, 1996 and February 24, 1997 at 9:00 pm following 7th Heaven. It was cancelled at the end of the season. Ancier noted that the show had \\"a rough season creatively\\", and attributed its cancellation to the fact that \\"serial dramas don't repeat well, making the investment too expensive\\". Its mid season replacement would be the eventual cult hit Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The first season was broadcast in the United Kingdom in the summer of 1996 on ITV in a prime time slot and became the highest rated new American series of that year. However, the second season was not network broadcast, and was shown in different ITV regions at different times in the late 1990s. Reception Scott D. Pierce of the Deseret News wrote of the Savannah premiere that \\"in an era where prime-time soaps have become campy and downright stupid, this new serial is sort of classy. In a trashy kind of way.\\" Pierce also described the show as \\"lush, lusty and lively ... We're not talking brain food here, but it does look like rather tasty junk food\\", and credited writers Jim Stanley and Diane Messina Stanley for making Savannah \\"a cut above Spelling's other prime- time soaps, Melrose Place and Beverly Hills, 90210.\\" References External links * * Category:1990s American drama television series Category:1996 American television series debuts Category:1997 American television series endings Category:American television soap operas Category:American primetime television soap operas Category:American primetime television dramas Category:English-language television shows Category:Mass media in Savannah, Georgia Category:Television series by CBS Television Studios Category:Television series by Spelling Television Category:Television shows set in Savannah, Georgia Category:The WB original programming ","title":"Savannah (TV series)"},{"id":"3657499","text":"Paper Moon is a Canadian indie rock band formed in 2000 in Winnipeg, that has released three albums and an EP.

These methods however were unable to support the rapid growth of the population since 1841. Diseases were caused by polluted water. The Hong Kong Government needed an urgent solution to the problem. Thus, it prepared a reward of 1,000 pounds to anyone who provided a solution to disease on 14 October 1859. The colonial government also allocated a budget of ¬£25,000 for the project. On 29 February 1860, S. B. Rawling, a clerk from Royal Engineers suggested the construction of a dam across the valley of Pokfulam to collect rainwater. The reservoir was completed in 1863. The construction did not meet the needs of the population because of budget-cuts, which left the dam to be far from adequate. Another reservoir above the original was built to meet the needs of the growing colony in 1877. Monument declaration 6 Historic Structures of Pok Fu Lam Reservoir were declared as monuments in 2009.

It opens or helps open the door automatically, waits, then closes it.  Types  There are 3 basic types of swing door operators: * Full Energy ‚Äì It opens and closes the door at full speed. * Low Energy ‚Äì It opens and closes the door at reduced speed to limit the kinetic energy of the moving door to levels deemed safe for disabled users. * Power Assist ‚Äì This is a version of the low-energy operator. It doesn't open the door; instead, it lets the user open the door manually at a reduced force, compared to opening against a standard door closer. It closes the door with the same speed limitations as a low-energy operator.  Uses  Full Energy operators are typically used on the outside doors of medium-sized retail business. (Larger retail businesses prefer sliding door operators.) Low Energy operators are typically used where a simple door closer is sufficient for able users, yet it is necessary to add access to disabled users: small businesses, apartments, bathrooms.  Triggering  A door operator may be triggered in various ways: * Approach sensor (such as a radar sensor in the form of a Gunn diode and Waveguide) ‚Äì the door opens when a user approaches it. * Pushbutton ‚Äì the door opens when a user presses a button. * Push-&-go ‚Äì the door opens fully when the user begins opening it. * Access control ‚Äì the door opens when an access control system determines the user is authorized to go through. A trigger from any of the above requests that the door be opened (or reopened if it was closing). The operator will heed hat requests only after it is able to do so safely for any other users in the area.  Safety sensors  A door operator may use sensors to prevent the door from coming into contact with a user. Full Energy operators require at least 3 sensors. Low-energy operators are not required to have safety sensors, as the door is allowed to come in contact with a user, given that the kinetic energy of the moving door is limited by the reduced moving speed. Historically, sensors have been simply floor mats that sense the weight of a user, one in the area immediately in front of the door (the approach side) and one in the area behind it (the swing side). The approach side mat is often used as a trigger sensor. The swing side mat prevents the door from starting to open as long as some other person is detected in the swing area; once the door starts opening, this mat is ignored, as it will sense the user going through. Today, infrared safety sensors or laser safety sensor are normally used. Four types are commonly used. *Header mounted presence sensor ‚Äì Mounted on the jamb above the door, on the approach side, it detects the presence of a person standing in front of the door. *Approach side, door mounted sensor ‚Äì Mounted on the approach side of the door itself, used as the door is closing to detect a user in the way of the closing door. Some safety sensor also safeguard the hinge area to protect hands and fingers during the closing process. In that case, the operator either stops the door or reopens it. *Swing side, door mounted sensor ‚Äì Mounted on the swing side of the door itself, used as the door is opening to detect a user in the way of the opening door. In that case, the operator stops the door. The sensitivity of infrared sensors must be reduced at the end of the opening angle, if it starts seeing a wall next to the door, so it may not confuse it with a user. Laser based sensors increase the safety by learning the surroundings of the door and dynamically adapt their detection fields to only ignore the wall next to the door. *Safety beam ‚Äì This beam crosses the path of the user past the swing side. If interrupted, the operator assumes that a person has crossed into the swing area, and it is not safe to open the door at full speed. This sensor is ignored once the door has started to open, as then the operator assumes that it is the user having gone through the door that has interrupted the beam. Typical swing door with a laser safety sensor  Opening technologies  The majority of the operators open the door directly or through an arm. * Overhead concealed mount ‚Äì the operator is mounted above the door and rotates the door directly, through its pivot. * Surface mount, push (scissor arm) ‚Äì the operator is mounted on the wall above the door, on the approach side and pushes the door with a linkage of 2 arms. * Surface mount, pull (track) ‚Äì the operator is mounted on the wall above the door, on the swing side and pulls the door with an arm whose end slides in a track mounted on the door. *Underfloor concealed units - the operator is mounted within the floor and rotates the door directly, through its pivot. This can also be off-set to work in conjunction with door hinges via an off- set door strap. Variations on the above exist. There are also rare operators that use a mechanism that is disconnected from the door, and reaches out and pushes on the door itself when it needs to open it.  Internal technologies  Operators are powered by an electric motor. They differ in how they use the motor's energy to open the door. Disengaging, closer-based, push-mount, electro-mechanical operator. View from above. Shades of blue: standard door closer. Shades of red: opener gears. Gold: motor. Operators use various internal technologies. * Some are built on top of a standard door closer. To open the door, the operator forces the closer in the opening direction. Then, the closer closes the door. The user may open the door manually, using just the door closer. In case of power failure while the door is open, the closer itself closes the door. * Some are built without a door closer. The motor opens and closes the door through reducing gears. The operator may or may not include a return spring to close the door in case of power failure while the door is open. Operators are often categorized by the means by which the motor's energy is applied. * Electromechanical ‚Äì the motor uses purely mechanical means to open the door: gears, cams, levers and such. This is the preferred type in the US. * Electro-hydraulic ‚Äì the motor drives a hydraulic pump, which pressurizes the oil in a door closer, which in turn turns the door closer and opens the door. This is the preferred type in Europe. (In the US it has a reputation of being prone to oil leaks.) * Electro-pneumatic ‚Äì the motor drives an air compressor and may be located away from the door. The air pressure is used to drive the operator above the door. This type is not common, and noise can be a factor if compressor is located close to a door. Typically, the compressor can be located up to 200 feet away ensuring that noise is not a factor. A typical life expectancy of a pneaumtic system is 10‚Äì15 years except the compressor. Best application of a pneumatic system is in a residential environment where usage is limited to 30‚Äì40 times a day. Of the electromechanical types, two approaches are used: *Disengaging ‚Äì the motor driven mechanism (the opener portion) is not joined to the closer, but only engages the closer when it is needed to open the door. When opening the door manually, the opener portion is still, so the opening is smooth and quiet. *Permanently engaged ‚Äì the motor driven mechanism (the opener portion) is always joined to the closer (if present) and to the door. When opening the door manually, the user is also driving the opener portion, so the opening is rough and noisy. Electro-hydraulic types are inherently quiet and smooth during manual opening, as the motor and pump are off.

Although obviously very ill (he died less than three months after most of the shooting was completed), Clift still managed to give a convincing performance in what has been termed a very moody and somber film. This characterization is in stark contrast to the exuberance displayed by his love interest, who was played by Meril, an obviously more youthful woman. L√©vy committed suicide on December 31, 1966, less than two months after the film's American release. Plot American physicist Professor Bower is effectively blackmailed by a shady CIA agent named Adams to help the CIA obtain secret microfilm from a defecting Russian scientist. The reluctant Bower travels to East Germany undercover as an antiques collector, where he encounters Heinzmann, an East German fellow physicist who is also a secret agent. Heinzmann is aware of Bower's meeting with Adams and of his intention to steal the microfilm, but their mutual respect for one another's tactics complicate the proceedings.

On 11 February 2014, it was announced that Sir Howard would retire from his role as vice-chancellor of Liverpool in 2015. Early life He grew up in Derbyshire, going to John Port Grammar School in Etwall, before attending Atlantic College, an independent (private) residential sixth form college in Wales, as a scholarship student. He attended the University of Essex where he gained a BA and PhD. Career His other academic posts include professor of sociology at the University of Essex and visiting appointments in Australia and the United States. From 1980 to 1983 he was professor of sociology and rural sociology at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. In August 2001, Newby ended a two-year term as president of Universities UK, the UK body which represents the university sector. His year- long presidency of the British Association ended in September 2002. He was appointed as the Chief Executive of The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) in October 2001. He served as President of the Academy of Social Sciences from 2008 to 2013. He is a director of the Universities Superannuation Scheme Limited, and chair of trustees for NatCen Social Research. Newby has published many books and articles on social change in rural England, and was for eight years a Rural Development Commissioner, a member of the government body responsible for the economic and social regeneration of rural England. From 1983 to 1988 he was director of the ESRC Data Archive, a national facility for storing and disseminating computerised datasets for use by researchers in the public and private sectors. In November 2008, Newby announced plans to transform Liverpool University into a centre for \\"knowledge exchange\\", opening a graduate school in India. In January 2009, academics and trade unions at Liverpool were reported as expressing unease at planned restructuring, the offer of voluntary redundancy to all staff and the use of a private company Spirit of Creation (previously used at UWE) in circumventing \\"established structures and procedures in pushing the plan through\\". There was also concern at what was perceived to be a shift away from humanities and social sciences towards science, where research income was potentially higher. Recent events In January 2010 the blogging platform WordPress suspended a number of blogs which it hosted after claims by the director of legal services at the University of Liverpool, Kevan Ryan, that some posts on them defamed Newby.See Index on Censorship report, \\"WordPress removes blog after libel allegation\\" (6 January 2010) Personal life He was married first in 1970 to Janet Elizabeth Craddock and they had two sons. The marriage was dissolved in 2003. He was married second in 2005 to Sheila Mary Mann and he has one step son and one step daughter. Newby was awarded a CBE in 1995 for his services to social science and a knighthood in 2000 for his services to higher education. He is a member of the Railway Heritage Committee and trustee of Swindon Steam Railway Museum. Bibliography *1977 The Deferential Worker: a Study of Farm Workers in East Anglia.

They may be of open- return type (also known as the Eiffel type, see figure), or closed-return flow (also known as the Prandtl type, see figure) with air moved by a propulsion system usually consisting of large axial fans that increase the dynamic pressure to overcome the viscous losses. =Open wind tunnel= Schematic of an open wind tunnel with a closed test section The working principle is based on the continuity and Bernoulli's equation: The continuity equation is given by: A V = constant \\\\Rightarrow \\\\frac{dA}{A}=-\\\\frac{dV}{V} The Bernoulli equation states:- P_{total}=P_{static} + P_{dynamic} = P_s + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\rho V^2 Putting Bernoulli into the continuity equation gives: V_m^2=2 \\\\frac{C^2}{C^2-1} \\\\frac{P_{settl}-p_m}{\\\\rho} \\\\approx 2 \\\\frac{\\\\Delta p}{\\\\rho} The contraction ratio of a windtunnel can now be calculated by: C = \\\\frac{A_{settl}}{A_m} =Closed wind tunnel= Schematic of a closed (return- flow) wind tunnel In a return-flow wind tunnel the return duct must be properly designed to reduce the pressure losses and to ensure smooth flow in the test section.

The highest speed is reached in the test section. The Mach number is approximately 1 with combined subsonic and supersonic flow regions. Testing at transonic speeds presents additional problems, mainly due to the reflection of the shock waves from the walls of the test section (see figure below or enlarge the thumb picture at the right). Therefore, perforated or slotted walls are required to reduce shock reflection from the walls. Since important viscous or inviscid interactions occur (such as shock waves or boundary layer interaction) both Mach and Reynolds number are important and must be properly simulated.

They existed from 1983 to 1986, and then reunited in 1998. They played with many bands such as the Dead Kennedys, Charged GBH and Suicidal Tendencies. They were also known for the comical disguises they wore on stage. History Genetic Control began in 1983 when two bands came together: Mike Price, Rob Hupp√© and Doug Crevier from the band \\"Out Of Step\\". Before \\"Out Of Step\\", Huppe and Crevier had played as an instrumental three-piece consisting of Huppe on guitar, Crevier on bass and Alex Soria on drums. They didn't have a band name at that time. Soria was also the singer in a band called The Nils, who were also just starting out. As it turns out Soria was not their drummer, but was just drumming with them as they did not have a regular drummer. Soria was working on getting the Nils happening at the time. Mike Price approached Hupp√© and Crevier and asked them if they wanted to start a band; \\"Out of Step\\" was formed. However, they never played a real show during this time. They just wrote during this time and played small shows at the BBC, their rehearsal space for friends. The drummer during this period was Marc Doucet from Moncton, New Brunswick. The band started jamming and playing many covers by Bad Religion, Minor Threat, and the Bad Brains. Mark left the band in 1983 and moved back to Halifax. Around this time, the remaining members started thinking about looking for a new drummer. Someone suggested that drummer Mike Brisbois and guitar player Rob Porter were looking for a singer and a bass player. They were called \\"Drunken Disturbance\\", formerly of \\"Terry Fox's Right Leg\\". The two bands united and immediately started jamming. The first gig Genetic Control played was at Club Cargo on St. Dennis Street on February 2, 1984. The name \\"Genetic Control\\" was taken from a lyric from the song \\"Get 'em out by Friday\\", from the album Foxtrot by the band Genesis. The name was also influenced by George Orwell and Aldus Huxley. Genetic Control was an organization that was in charge of designing people in the future from Huxley's novel Brave New World. Porter and Brisbois used to beat each other up all the time. They would show up at rehearsal with black eyes and bruises. They were roommates, worked together and played in the same band. The other members had to make a choice, and since Brisbois was a songwriter, as a result Brisbois was asked to leave. Louis Leveque was then added from the local band Unruled, which played a lot of Discharge and GBH influenced music. Leveque was about 16 or 17 and had played with a Genesis cover band before joining Unruled. He was by far the best drummer in any of the punk bands in Montreal at the time. Once he joined, the band went to a whole new level musically. The band used to jam the entire album Killer by Alice Cooper, and rehearsed four or five times a week. Influenced by Minor Threat and the Bad Brains, the band established itself in an old apartment block which also served as a rehearsal space for local bands. It was dubbed the BBC (for Bleury Beach Club), which gave birth to the 1980s Montreal hardcore scene. The band's songs are in the form of short stories, depicting people and situations as the band sees them. The band first released the song \\"Suburban Life\\" on the Primitive Air-Raid compilation album on Psyche Industry Records in 1984. They wanted to record an album in 1984, but they did not have sufficient funds, and settled for a single release. \\"First Impressions\\" was released on Generic Records, and only 500 copies were pressed. Singer Mike Price recorded while on crutches, after he was hurt in the mosh pit during one of their first shows. They also recorded an album in 1985, but there were no master tapes made, as the band opted instead for just a cassette recording, as they could not afford to pay for the multi-track tape, a decision the band and many fans have regretted over the years. The band was supposed to go on tour but shortly after, failing to release their LP, they split up because of conflicts between their members. In the years after, their single, which was already very rare, became one of the most sought after collectibles by punk rock record collectors all around the world, fetching as much as $500 on eBay during the 1990s. This prompted the German label Lost & Found Records, to press a bootleg of the 7\\" on CD, with the song \\"Suburban Life\\" as a bonus track. However, the band were never paid for the article. Genetic Control reunited in 1998 for the Les Foufounes √âlectriques 15-year anniversary, playing a few shows during the summer. They then started to play regularly again, even though some members were by then in Toronto, and others in Vancouver and Montreal. In 2005, they released Brave New World on Sonik's Chicken Shrimp Records, which was taken from one of their 1998 concerts, and included a new song, the original 7\\" single and \\"Suburban Life\\". It became the first of the Sonik's Chicken Shrimp Records releases to go out of print.The Gazette, Montreal (May 21, 1998), P.

The song is an example of both the classic paulista samba, the variant of samba developed in S√£o Paulo, and the use of a composition structure known as \\"samba-de-breque\\" (literally brake samba), where the instrumental accompaniment stops suddenly, giving room to a brief commentary in spoken word about the lyric subject by the lead singer, very much like opening parenthesis.

Named for abolitionist Charles Sumner, it started in 1905 during a period of racial tension as a segregated school for black (\\"Negro\\") students, which offered vocational training, but emphasized college- preparatory training. Located at 1610 N. 8th Street, the current architecturally significant complex began with its Art Deco core in 1937, but has been repeatedly expanded. The segregated Sumner High School closed in 1978, converting at that time to its present high-challenge magnet program. History Sumner's origins can be traced to a death in a racially charged environment. On April 12, 1904, Roy Martin, a white student at Kansas City, Kansas High School was shot and killed at Kerr Park. An African American named Louis Gregory was accused and arrested. The night of his arrest, a lynch mob gathered, and a group of African American citizens prevented the mob from breaking into the jail to take Gregory from custody. Gregory was subsequently convicted of first degree murder. The morning after the shooting, all African American students were blocked from entering the high schools by white students and white citizens. Many whites agitated for segregated schools. For some time, white students attended classes at Kansas City Kansas High School in the morning, while black students attended in the afternoon. In this desperate situation, some African American and white citizens eventually decided to petition the Kansas legislature to change the law prohibiting segregated high schools, requesting an allowance for a segregated high school in Kansas City, Kansas. On February 22, 1905, the Kansas Legislature passed such a bill, which was reluctantly signed by the governor. In 1905 Sumner high school opened, the first de jure segregated high school in the state of Kansas. Students moved from the old Kansas City High School and the old Central High School in Kansas City. The original school was named Manual Training High School and built at the corner of 9th and Washington Boulevard. After objections to that name from the black community, the name of Sumner was chosen instead to honor Charles Sumner (1811‚Äì1884), a member of the United States Senate from 1851 to 1874. Charles Sumner had been very strong abolitionist and a leader of the Radical Republicans who had fought for the rights of the black people during Reconstruction. In 1932, a small plot on northwest corner of 8th and Oakland was purchased which now houses the current Sumner Academy. The current complex of buildings began in 1937. In 1978 Sumner High School was officially closed as Sumner High School. Students were reassigned as part of court-ordered desegregation mandating busing for African-American students to new schools, and giving all district students the option of whether or not to attend the new school. It was reopened as 'Sumner Academy of Arts and Sciences', a magnet school for highly motivated and academically talented students. In 2003, Sumner won a prestigious national award ‚Äì Sumner Academy received the U.S. Dept of Education's NCLB ‚Äì Blue Ribbon Schools Award for its scores on the Kansas state assessments, making it just one of four schools in Kansas to earn the distinction. In 2004, Sumner received a \\"Great IDEAS\\" grant (funded/sponsored by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Fund) for the 2004‚Äì05 school year, which encourages teachers in SLC (Small Learning Communities) to work together to develop innovative programs and projects to improve student learning. In the summer of 2005 (July 20‚Äì24), Sumner High School, later Sumner Academy of Arts & Science, celebrated its 100th Anniversary since students first walked through the doors at 9th and Washington Boulevard. https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high- schools/kansas/districts/kansas-city/sumner-academy-of-arts--science-8036 Academics Sumner Academy was designated a Blue Ribbon School in 1984 and 2003. Sumner Academy maintains high behavioral and academic standards for its students. Students must receive a letter of acceptance before enrolling at Sumner Academy and once enrolled are required to maintain GPA of 2.5 or higher to continue to attend. The school was selected as a Blue Ribbon School in 1984 and 2003. The Blue Ribbon Award recognizes public and private schools which perform at high levels or have made significant academic improvements. One factor responsible for Sumner Academy's rigorous academic standing is its participation in the International Baccalaureate (IB) Program which is based on a 5.0 scale. Sumner began offering students the opportunity to participate in the IB program in 1987. The academy offers 20 different IB classes and over one-third of the faculty have received extensive IB training. Although only juniors and seniors are eligible to take IB classes, the effect of the IB program permeates the Sumner Academy curriculum at all grade levels. Ninth and tenth graders often take pre-IB courses with the anticipation of enrolling in future IB work. Students have the opportunity to take International Baccalaureate coursework and exams. The IB participation rate at Sumner Academy of Arts & Science is 97 percent. The student body makeup is 41 percent male and 59 percent female, and the total minority enrollment is 79 percent. Sumner Academy of Arts & Science is 1 of 6 high schools in the Kansas City.

Architecture =Original Art Deco Building= By 1937 Sumner had outgrown its previous facilities at Ninth and Washington and was using every inch of available space for classes. That year the federal Works Progress Administration deemed Sumner eligible for a New Deal grant to construct a new building, eventually providing $378,000 for building and equipment. The school board selected Joseph W. Radotinsky of Kansas City to be the architect, and in 1938 issued $751,000 in bonds. The building was built 1938‚Äì1939 and dedicated in January 1940, with classes beginning January 2. Radotinsky's design features the Art Deco style in vogue at the time for federally sponsored public works. The most striking element is the central streamlined entrance tower, which provides visual focus while housing the heating units, air intake chambers and associated filters. The exterior consists of an articulated pattern of two tones of fire-clay brick accented by limestone trim. The growing impact of European modernism can be seen in the massing of the structure; David H. Sachs and George Ehrlich particularly cite the influence of Willem Marinus Dudok, a Dutch architect best known for the Hilversum City Hall (Raadhuis, 1931). In turn, Dudok had borrowed extensively from Frank Lloyd Wright and the Prairie School, particularly in terms of brickwork and the massing of geometric forms. =Subsequent Expansion= There have been a number of expansions to the campus complex since this original elegant building was erected: *In 1964 the field house athletic field added. *In 1975 the new gymnasium, cafeteria and student center were added. *In 1978, when the school was officially closed as Sumner High School, there was extensive renovation of classrooms, library and science rooms. *In 1985, the library was expanded, although the Sumner Courtyard decreased in size in order for the academic expansion of the student population. *In 2002, voters approved a proposed $120 million bond issue at the Municipal Election Tuesday (April 3, 2001) to air-condition schools, improve technology, and make other upgrades to schools and public libraries. Sumner was part of Phase II, which was completed in the summer of 2002. *In 2005, Sumner was named to the National Register of Historic Places and the Register of Historic Kansas Places. =The West Wing (New Building)= In 2010, a new wing was added to include all new technology. The addition was built over the west parking lot, and replaced the old temporary classroom units. The rooms are spacious, with carpeted floors, and can hold up to 40 student desks. The west wing also has new lockers and bathrooms and is equipped with some of the very latest in classroom technology. Alma mater Music by Jeff Beck. Lyrics by Annette Fick.

The nanotubes are approximately 50,000 times thinner than a human hair. Originally, it was fabricated as a way to handle carbon nanotubes, but it is also being studied and developed into applications by several research groups, showing promise as vehicle armor, personal armor, and next-generation electronics and displays. Background Buckypaper is a macroscopic aggregate of carbon nanotubes (CNT), or \\"buckytubes\\". It owes its name to the buckminsterfullerene, the 60 carbon fullerene (an allotrope of carbon with similar bonding that is sometimes referred to as a \\"Buckyball\\" in honor of R. Buckminster Fuller). Synthesis The generally accepted methods of making CNT films involves the use of non-ionic surfactants, such as Triton X-100 and sodium lauryl sulfate, which improves their dispersibility in aqueous solution. These suspensions can then be membrane filtered under positive or negative pressure to yield uniform films. The van der Waals force's interaction between the nanotube surface and the surfactant can often be mechanically strong and quite stable and therefore there are no assurances that all the surfactant is removed from the CNT film after formation. Washing with methanol, an effective solvent in the removal of Triton X, was found to cause cracking and deformation of the film. It has also been found that Triton X can lead to cell lysis and in turn tissue inflammatory responses even at low concentrations. In order to avoid adverse side-effects from the possible presence of surfactants, an alternative casting process can be used involving a frit compression method that did not require the use of surfactants or surface modification. The dimensions can be controlled through the size of the syringe housing and through the mass of carbon nanotubes added. Their thicknesses are typically much larger than surfactant-cast buckypaper and have been synthesized from 120 Œºm up to 650 Œºm; whilst no nomenclature system exists to govern thicknesses for samples to be classified as paper, samples with thicknesses greater than 500 Œºm are referred to as buckydiscs. The frit compression method allows rapid casting of buckypaper and buckydiscs with recovery of the casting solvent and control over the 2D and 3D geometry. Aligned multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT) growth has been used in CNT film synthesis through the domino effect. In this process, \\"forests\\" of MWNTs are pushed flat in a single direction, compressing their vertical orientation into the horizontal plane, which results in the formation of high-purity buckypaper with no further purification or treatment required. By comparison, when a buckypaper sample was formed from the 1 ton compression of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) generated MWNT powder, any application of a solvent led to the immediate swelling of the film till it reverted into particulate matter. It appears that for the CNT powder used, compression alone was insufficient to generate robust buckypaper and highlights that the aligned growth methodology generates in situ tube-tube interactions not found in CVD CNT powder and are preserved through to the domino pushing formation of buckypaper. Recently, a new scalable CNT film fabrication method has been developed: Surface-Engineered Tape Casting (SETC) technique. The SETC technique solves the main challenge of tape-casting which is the detachment of the dried and the typically sticky CNT film from the supporting-substrate. To achieve a perfect detached film, the supporting- substrate has to be engineered with micro-pyramid pore structure morphology. SETC produces large area films from any commercially available carbon nanotubes with tunable length, thickness, density and composition. Properties Comparative flame test of airplanes made of cellulose, carbon buckypaper and inorganic boron nitride nanotube buckypaper. Buckypaper is one tenth the weight yet potentially 500 times stronger than steel when its sheets are stacked to form a composite. It could disperse heat like brass or steel and it could conduct electricity like copper or silicon. Applications Among the possible uses for buckypaper that are being researched: *Fire protection: covering material with a thin layer of buckypaper significantly improves its fire resistance due to the efficient reflection of heat by the dense, compact layer of carbon nanotubes or carbon fibers. *If exposed to an electric charge, buckypaper could be used to illuminate computer and television screens. It could be more energy-efficient, lighter, and could allow for a more uniform level of brightness than current cathode ray tube (CRT) and liquid crystal display (LCD) technology. *Since individual carbon nanotubes are one of the most thermally conductive materials known, buckypaper lends itself to the development of heat sinks that would allow computers and other electronic equipment to disperse heat more efficiently than is currently possible. This, in turn, could lead to even greater advances in electronic miniaturization. *Films also could protect electronic circuits and devices within airplanes from electromagnetic interference, which can damage equipment and alter settings. Similarly, such films could allow military aircraft to shield their electromagnetic \\"signatures\\", which can be detected via radar. *Buckypaper could act as a filter membrane to trap microparticles in air or fluid. Because the nanotubes in buckypaper are insoluble and can be functionalized with a variety of functional groups, they can selectively remove compounds or can act as a sensor. *Produced in high enough quantities and at an economically viable price, buckypaper composites could serve as an effective armor plating. *Buckypaper can be used to grow biological tissue, such as nerve cells. Buckypaper can be electrified or functionalized to encourage growth of specific types of cells. *The Poisson's ratio for carbon nanotube buckypaper can be controlled and has exhibited auxetic behavior, capable of use as artificial muscles. *Electrode materials for supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, and vanadium redox flow batteries.

Dunnery was originally the frontman for British prog-pop band It Bites, working with the band between 1982 and 1990 (during which he co-wrote and sang their No. 6 UK hit single, \\"Calling All the Heroes\\"). Since 1990 Dunnery has pursued a solo career, and has owned and run his own Aquarian Nation record label since 2001. In addition, he has performed as a sideman and musical contributor for artists as diverse as Robert Plant, Ian Brown, Lauryn Hill, Santana and Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe. He has worked as producer and/or collaborator with David Sancious, Chris Difford (of Squeeze), James Sonefeld (Hootie and the Blowfish), Erin Moran, Steven Harris (ex-The Cult, Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction), and Ashley Reaks (Younger Younger 28s). Dunnery was one of the candidates invited to audition as a lead singer and frontman for Genesis following Phil Collins' departure in 1996 (although the position ultimately went to Ray Wilson). He also played in the reformed 1960s beat/prog band The Syn between 2008 and mid-2009. Musical style Dunnery's musical approach is diverse. His early musical influences were progressive rock (with Genesis being a particular inspiration) and jazz-rock fusion musicians including John McLaughlin, Soft Machine, Focus, Return to Forever and Jeff Beck. His 1980s work with It Bites mixed an outright love of varied pop music with a solid grounding in progressive rock and hard rock. His solo work has continued to express these influences but added further elements including soul, disco, folk music, blues, hip-hop beats, chamber pop and electronica. During the late 1980s Dunnery acquired a reputation as an up-and-coming British guitar hero based on his aggressive and dramatic playing style (which merged diverse hard rock, pop and funk stylings with a fluid, spiralling hammer-on lead-guitar technique inspired by Allan Holdsworth). He has criticised his lead guitar approach at that time as having been immature and has sometimes affectionately parodied it, most notably on his live album Hometown 2001. He mastered jazz, classical and country fingerpicking to serve the arrangements for his songs. Aside from singing and playing the guitar, Dunnery plays drums, bass guitar, organ, various keyboards, percussion and the Tapboard (a guitar-related instrument). He plays the majority of the instrumental parts on his records. Biography =Childhood and formative years (including early bands)= Francis Dunnery grew up as part of a musical family in the small Cumberland town of Egremont (at 28 Queens Drive on the Gulley Flats estate). He is the younger son of Charlie Dunnery (a former member of the Jimmy Shand band), and his wife, Kathleen, both now deceased.Dunnery family profile Frank displayed an interest in music from an early age, showing promise as an embryonic drummer, with his mother later recalling that \\"he was always drumming with his hands. Asking him what he wanted for his tea, he'd be drumming on something the whole time.\\" His elder brother Barry \\"Baz\\" Dunnery (whom Frank cites as his greatest single influence) was a highly regarded rock guitarist who played with heavy rock band Necromandus and subsequently Ozzy Osbourne's first post- Black Sabbath band (preceding the formation of the Randy Rhoads-led Blizzard of Oz bandOzzy Osbourne by Garry Sharpe-Young (in the Rockdetector book series) ; retrieved 25 September 2008) and the ELO-spinoff Violinski. The brothers remained close until Baz's death in June 2008, and Baz would join Frank onstage on several occasions. Dunnery has described his family home as having been like \\"a bustling caf√©\\" full of musicians and family friends of all generations, and recalls \\"my Mam and Dad were the greatest. They were kind, funny and gracious in a working class way. They were giving people. They had a way about them that made everyone feel welcome in our home ... My Mam and Dad would feed them great food, share cigarettes and partake in humorous and interesting conversation.\\" Unfortunately, Dunnery's childhood was blighted by his parents' mutual alcoholism. He once described them as \\"binge drinkers, two weeks on and two months off... Once my Mam and Dad started drinking alcohol I never knew what was going to happen. Everything seems to happen fast. One minute it was paradise and the next minute it was sheer hell. It was horrific. ... Anyone who has lived under this nervousness will know exactly what I mean. I lived under this constant threat all my life.\\" From the age of eleven, Frank spent four days a week living by himself on a trailer park to avoid problems at home, going to school during the day and bolstering his independence and living expenses by working as a musician at night. His first professional work was as half of an early teens duo with his friend Peter Lockhart which played local venues including the Tarnside Caravan Club and various cabaret venues. He recalls \\"we were the cute little duo that would open up for the main act... I would just bash along as Peter sang Elvis songs and played the organ.\\" Adding guitar and singing to his musical skills, Dunnery moved on to other projects of varying levels of commitment ‚Äì \\"I played in a few local bands and with lots of different musicians, especially a group called Waving at Trains I was in with Don Mackay, who is a fantastic musician. He wrote some really good songs, too.\\" Waving At Trains featured Mackay as frontman, Dunnery on lead guitar and vocals, and Glyn Davies and Frank Hall on bass guitar and drums respectively (both of the latter having also played in bands with Frank's brother Barry, including Necromandus and Nerves).Morning Dew/Kobblers Dream page on 'Cumbrian Bands of The 70s' homepage Regarding this period, Dunnery would later comment \\"There was no one I could rely on... I somehow made sure that I had other places to live and spend my time (talk about the power of the human spirit) because I couldn't bear to be at home when my parents were drinking. I can still remember the smell of the house when my parents were drowning in hops. To this day the smell of Carlsberg Special Brew makes me want to vomit.\\" In later years, Dunnery would himself drink heavily and eventually succumb to alcoholism (finally overcoming his addiction in the early 1990s). Many of his songs would reference his struggles with alcoholism and the behaviour that surrounded it. =It Bites (1982‚Äì1990)= In 1982, when he was nineteen, Dunnery formed the rock band It Bites (taking the role of lead singer and guitarist). The other members of the band were his Egremont schoolfriends Bob Dalton (drums, vocals) and Dick Nolan (bass, vocals) plus John Beck (keyboards, vocals) who came from Mirehouse; a suburb of Whitehaven. Following a career playing the pub and youth club circuit the band temporarily split, with Dunnery moving to London. The band reformed some time later and left Egremont entirely to relocate to London in 1984, eventually signing a record contract with Virgin Records. Playing an unfashionable but energetic blend of progressive rock, hard rock and pure pop, It Bites released three studio albums, The Big Lad in the Windmill (1986), Once Around the World (1988) and the critically acclaimed Eat Me in St Louis (1989). It Bites' biggest hit single was \\"Calling All The Heroes\\" in 1986, which reached No. 6 in the UK Singles Chart. During their lifetime, It Bites became a successful band (able to fill the Hammersmith Odeon in London and undertaking tours with The Beach Boys and Jethro Tull). It Bites split up in 1990 in Los Angeles on the eve of recording their fourth studio album. Various factors were cited in the break-up, which Dunnery recalls as being a case of the fact that \\"the band had come to the end. It was a natural process. We fell out over a few things, there wasn't one big issue or problem, it was daft little things. We had just drifted apart. It wasn't anyone's fault, but we split.\\" Following Dunnery's departure, It Bites briefly continued with a new frontman (Lee Knott) and a succession of new names (Navajo Kiss, Sister Sarah) but split up after failing to sign a new recording deal. A post-breakup It Bites live album (drawn mainly from 1989 concerts) called \\"Thank You and Goodnight,\\" was released in 1991. =1990‚Äì1995: Los Angeles and London (Welcome to the Wild Country & Fearless)= Following the 1990 break-up of It Bites, Dunnery settled in Los Angeles, indulging what he later acknowledged to be a disastrously hedonistic lifestyle. During this period he recorded his first solo album, Welcome to the Wild Country, which was released on Virgin Records in 1991. Produced by David Hentschel, this was a much more rough-and-ready album than the heavily engineered and technically fastidious It Bites records, consisting mostly of hard rock songs performed by a power trio (although the record did also contain an extended blues-jam song and a keyboard-heavy ballad called \\"Jackal in Your Mind\\"). The record enjoyed little success, being released only in Japan. (He regained the rights in 2001, re-issuing it on Aquarian Nation Records.Francis Dunnery biography , Aquarian Nation Records homepage) He has since described Welcome to the Wild Country as \\"having been recorded at a time when I didn't know who I was\\" although he disinterred the album and its songs for a tour over ten years later. Towards the end of his time in Los Angeles, Dunnery addressed his drugs and alcohol problems and cleaned up his lifestyle. He has subsequently been open about his problems with alcohol addiction and drug abuse during this period, and a number of his songs refer to the effects that these experiences have had on his life. In 1993 Dunnery returned to the UK and took up the position of guitarist in former Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant's live band. He performed on several tracks on Plant's 1993 album Fate of Nations and played on the accompanying world tour, acting as Plant's main onstage foil. Plant made a guest appearance on Dunnery's second solo album, Fearless, which was released on Atlantic Records in 1994. This performed considerably better than its predecessor, and showed a much broader range of styles. \\"American Life in the Summertime,\\" the lead single from the album, received considerable airplay in the States. Dunnery promoted Fearless with his first solo tour of the UK (an all-acoustic affair in small venues). The Glasgow date of the tour was recorded for a live album, One Night in Sauchiehall Street, which was released on the tiny Cottage Industry label in 1995. This album documented Dunnery's change to an acoustic approach, playing solo accompanied only by occasional second guitarist and harmony singer Ashley Reakes (later to briefly find success as the prime mover behind Younger Younger 28s). It was also the first evidence on record of Dunnery's live approach as raconteur as well as musician (which incorporated a surprising degree of confessional story, philosophical musing and salty stand-up comedy). =1995‚Äì1999: New York & Vermont (Tall Blonde Helicopter, Let's Go Do What Happens, period of retreat)= By 1995, Dunnery had relocated yet again, this time to New York City. His third studio album ‚Äì Tall Blonde Helicopter ‚Äì was released on Atlantic that year, and abandoned the predominantly pop-oriented sound of Fearless in favour of an eclectic mixture of soft ballads and acoustic rockers. It also displayed a much greater confidence in songwriting. In 1996, Dunnery was approached to audition as lead singer for his old heroes Genesis, but ended up continuing with his existing solo career. Dissatisfied with Atlantic's promotion of his work (and beginning to suspect that he would need to take more responsibility for making things work in the future) he formed a power trio which played various dates in America. The sound of this band was captured on Dunnery's next album Let's Go Do What Happens (1998), released on Razor and Tie Records whose limited resources caused Let's Go Do What Happens to be initially only released in the United States. During this period, Dunnery also played on Lauryn Hill's 1998 debut album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, and Carlos Santana's 1999 comeback album Supernatural. Increasingly dissatisfied with the music industry, Dunnery went into semi- retirement as a musician later in 1998 and set up a new home in the Vermont mountains with his girlfriend, Helena Faccenda. Francis Dunnery biography , Aquarian Nation homepage where he devoted the next few years to breeding and training horses (for which he studied under John Lyons, the \\"horse whisperer\\") as well as carpentry, astrology, and Jungian psychology. Dunnery continued to write songs as and when the inspiration took him. He has sometime commented that his songwriting is a periodic activity, stating in a 2009 interview with the PhillyBurbs online newspaper: \\"I cannot write songs on a nine-to-five basis. At the risk of sounding pretentious, my songs come from somewhere else and I have to wait for them, so it's not up to me when I receive them. When the songs start to come, they all come at the same time. I may get 20 songs in three to four days and then it all stops again.\\" =2000‚Äì2003: Return to music (Man, Hometown 2001, Aquarian Nation & the It Bites reunion)= In 2000, inspired by watching a televised Shakti concert (featuring his old hero John McLaughlin), Dunnery later admitted he \\"realised there was still a musician in me, and that I had to be as true to that side of my character as I was being to the other sides.\\" He decided to re-engage with the music business, although this time he decided to do it entirely on his own terms and to take as much responsibility for the outcome as he could. His first step was to refresh himself by returning to the UK for the first time in five years to play a few concerts, and his second step was to set up his own internet-based record label, Aquarian Nation, with the intention of releasing his future albums on it (as well as albums by other artists). For the UK tour, Dunnery formed a new backing band called The Grass Virgins, featuring second guitarist Dave Colquhoun, bass guitarist Matt Pegg, and singer/keyboard player Erin Moran. Surprised and gratified that he remained a live draw popular enough to sell out venues, Dunnery returned soon afterwards for a much larger tour and support slots with Hootie and the Blowfish. The Grass Virgins continued as his back-up band over the next few years, despite changes in the line-up (John Dunnery would replace Colquhoun, John Williams and Wayne Wilkinson joined on keyboards and laptop respectively, and Dorie Jackson replaced Erin Moran). The first Aquarian Nation release was Dunnery's comeback album, Man, released in 2001. Recorded in Vermont (USA) and Oswestry (UK), the album's music developed some of the electronic aspects of Let's Go Do What Happens (via keyboards and programming by Dunnery and his brother-in-law Dave McCracken, but featured much more acoustic instrumentation (guitars and cellos), a strong vocal interplay between Dunnery and Moran, and pared-down percussion (with almost no drums and with the rhythmic drive provided primarily by Matt Pegg's bass guitar). Man was also Dunnery's most personal and direct album to date, heavily influenced by autobiographical and spiritual matters (in particular parenthood, manhood and reflections on finding a sense of home as well as featuring a strong element of Jungian psychology). Dunnery has since commented \\"I was very depressed when I wrote the 'Man' CD. It was a difficult birth. I was going through such turmoil in my life. My mother was dying, my relationship was ending, and in complete contrast, my daughter Ava was being born. [But] I think I'm at peace with that side of my life now.\\" Despite the weight of the subject matter, Man proved to be one of his most successful and popular albums. Dunnery toured the UK to promote Man, accompanied by Matt Pegg on bass guitar (with occasional guest appearances by other musicians). A live album ‚Äì Hometown 2001 ‚Äì was recorded 14 June 2001 at the Whitehaven Civic Hall in Cumbria and released around Christmas time the same year: it featured the Dunnery/Pegg duo plus a guest appearance from John Dunnery and Wayne Wilkinson. During 2002, Dunnery made several albums released on Aquarian Nation. In addition to releasing Dunnery's own records the label had been set up to release records by other musicians, pursuing a cooperative approach with a degree of profit share and with all Aquarian Nation musicians contributing to each other's recordings. The label had a mission statement to \\"help support and promote artistic integrity\\" and went on to sign up to an ongoing partnership with Flying Spot Entertainment for the creation of original film/video programming. The first of these releases was Chris Difford (ex- Squeeze)'s I Didn't Get Where I Am. In keeping with the Aquarian Nation method, Dunnery played on the record, and also produced and co-wrote the material with Difford. Dunnery also toured as part of Difford's band to promote the album, playing on a tour with Chris Rea and Elvis Costello. The next Aquarian Nation releases developed the label's tone as a platform for songs of a more personal nature. The first of these was Nearly Killed Keith (the debut album by John & Wayne, aka John Dunnery and Wayne Wilkinson from The Grass Virgins), a collection of folk-tinged songs drawn from the duo's day-jobs as jobbing carpenters in the building industry. This was followed by Songs From the Mission of Hope, the debut album by Stephen Harris, who wrote an atypically quiet, mediative and predominantly acoustic album dealing with his own chequered history as an adoptee. Once again, Dunnery produced and co- wrote both albums (and played various instruments on them including keyboards, guitars and drums). Dunnery's next major British concert (at the Union Chapel, London, 2003) was in part a showcase for Aquarian Nation, featuring performances by Dunnery, Stephen Harris, John & Wayne (with Dorie Jackson), plus a guest appearance by Chris Difford. The concert finale was a two-song It Bites reunion, with Dunnery playing \\"Hunting the Whale\\" as a duet with John Beck and the whole band playing \\"Still Too Young to Remember.\\" The event was recorded and released on DVD as Live at the Union Chapel (credited to Francis Dunnery & Friends) in 2004, with a wider release the following year. =2004‚Äì2007: The Middle Passage (The Gulley Flats Boys, House Concerts, second parting with It Bites)= By this time, Frank was based in Pennsylvania, studying for a psychology degree at Goddard University, and doing session and production work to developing Aquarian Nation as a company. In newsletters, he promised that his next three projects would be a solo album, Dorie Jackson's debut album and new recordings with the reunited It Bites. In 2005, Dunnery released the first of these, a solo double album called The Gulley Flats Boys, a more sedate and acoustic album than its predecessor, featuring next to no drum or percussion parts and sparse use of electric guitar. It was recorded by Dunnery with piano/keyboard player David Sancious and Dorie Jackson on backing vocals. Dunnery acknowledged the album was the product of a mid-life crisis, but embraced the fact. In 2005, Dunnery embarked on a \\"house concert\\" world tour, suggesting to fans that they book him to perform in their own homes for a paying audience, in a drug and alcohol-free environment. The concept proved to be very popular, not least with Dunnery himself, who has described them as \\"phenomenally successful.\\" Dunnery continues to perform house concerts to this day and describes a typical performance as \\"(showing up) as a friend ‚Äì you can't show up as a rock dude or something ‚Äì and it's just me and my acoustic guitar, no amplification, singing my songs and holding a 90-minute lecture on the human condition. I sing songs and tell stories of my life. It's not a party; it's more like going to church, but church with swearing!... (There is) an exchange of energy that I call a 'jacuzzi'. At the end of 90 minutes, everybody has dropped their ego. They don't even realise that has happened, but they have gradually taken off their clothes and gone into that energetic jacuzzi together. Something like that is a lot harder to achieve in a rock music arena.\\" In 2006, it was confirmed that the reunion of the original It Bites line-up had foundered and that Dunnery had been replaced by singer and guitarist John Mitchell (Frost*, Kino). In October 2007 Dunnery released a free download of a song called \\"Feels Like Summertime,\\" which had initially been written for It Bites shortly before the band's original split in 1990 and was reworked as part of the unsuccessful 2003 reunion. Dunnery had rearranged and reworked the song for a third time (with new players), and made it available to promote a full-band \\"electric\\" tour which ‚Äì although based mostly around his 1991 solo album Welcome to the Wild Country ‚Äì featured several It Bites songs. =2008‚Äì2009: The Band Traveller (House concerts, DVDs, plus work with James Sonefeld and The Syn)= In 2008, Dunnery continued to perform numerous solo performances and house concerts, this time centred on material from Tall Blonde Helicopter. His summer and fall schedule included a full-band tour, culminating in a performance in Seattle which was recorded by Flying Spot, Inc. for subsequent release as a special edition concert/documentary DVD. (Originally scheduled for a 2009 release and titled Louder Than Usual, this was finally released in September 2010 as a DVD with accompanying CD) Earlier that year, Dunnery released an \\"official video bootleg\\" DVD from the 2001 Man tour, titled In The Garden of Mystic Lovers. Later, he produced and played on Snowman Melting, the first solo album by James Sonefeld of Hootie and the Blowfish. Dunnery would join singer Steve Nardelli's revived 1960s progressive rock/beat band The Syn as guitarist, playing alongside Nardelli, keyboard player Tom Brislin and bass player Jamie Bishop as well as two members of American progressive rock band Echolyn (guitarist Brett Kull and drummer Paul Ramsey). Dunnery also brought in his backing vocal foil Dorie Jackson. He was musical director for the band's 2009 album Big Sky. This line-up of The Syn began an American tour in April 2009 but broke up after six dates. =2009‚Äì2010: A Blast From The Past (The New Progressives and There's A Whole New World Out There)= Dunnery announced the formation of his \\"New Progressives\\" project, which had two stated aims ‚Äì the first to reclaim and rework the songs Dunnery had written with It Bites, and the second to develop a new approach to progressive rock. The project was to feature a core band centred on Dunnery plus the involvement of various collaborators from variousFrancis Dunnery newspage, August 2011 periods of progressive rock history. The core band featured Dunnery on lead vocals, guitar, keyboards and tapboard and drew on the same line-up he had assembled for The Syn the previous year, minus Nardelli (Tom Brislin, Jamie Bishop, Dorie Jackson, Brett Kull and Paul Ramsey). Dunnery's next album, There's a Whole New World Out There, released on 3 October 2009, was centred on the New Progressives (plus guests) and featured a succession of reworking of old It Bites songs, plus a variety of similarly rearranged cover versions. The New Progressives toured the UK, American and Australia to promote the record, with guest appearances from other musicians where possible. In 2009, Jem Godfrey (Frost*) announced on the Frost* Forum that he and Dunnery had both contributed solos to the title track of Big Big Train's upcoming album, The Underfall Yard. =2011‚Äìpresent: Future and Past (Made in Space, Frankenstein Monster, Vampires)= On 12 August 2011, Dunnery released a new album called Made in Space (which was written and recorded in a contemporary R'n'B style) and took out an accompanying \\"Astrology Theater Show \\" tour of the UK, which featured himself and Dorie Jackson. He also announced that he would be recorded a cover version of Peter Gabriel's The Rhythm of the Heat as part of Sonic Elements, a new \\"fantasy rock\\" band put together by Dave Kerzner. In 2012, Dunnery made a guest appearance on Steve Hackett's album Genesis Revisited II, singing on two tracks ‚Äì \\"Dancing With the Moonlit Knight\\" and \\"Supper's Ready\\" (the \\"As Sure As Eggs Is Eggs (Aching Men's Feet)\\" section) ‚Äì as well as contributing additional guitar. Dunnery also made a guest appearance on Hackett's subsequent Genesis Revisited tour, singing at the Arcada Theater show in St Charles, Illinois on 20 September 2013, and at the Scottish Rites Auditorium in Collingswood, NJ 27 March 2014, where he sang much-loved Genesis favourite, \\"Dancing with the Moonlit Knight.\\" From late 2012 to autumn 2013, Dunnery worked on a very different but equally personal project, recording a set of songs originally written by his late brother Barry's 1970s hard rock band Necromandus. The resulting album, Frankenstein Monster, was released by Aquarian Nation on 16 October 2013. Regarding the album, Dunnery commented: \\"I must say that this has been one hell of a journey both emotionally and musically. I learned so much about my brother during the making of this album and so much about myself ... Listening back now as it comes into focus I am very pleased and proud of the results. We have kept very close to the originals, sometimes exact and where it need a little more musicality or space we were smart enough to add our own parts without ruining the song. I know exactly what Baz would have liked so I only added things I know he would have liked. Paul Brown and Sconna [John Dunnery] were with me all the way, they both worked their arses off for months on end. Tony Beard was a star. He completely kept the youthful enthusiasm that [former Necromandus drummer] Frank Hall had yet also added a little more pocket and musicality to the tunes.\\"News on Frankenstein Monster project on Francis Dunnery newspage, October 2013 For late 2013, Dunnery put together The Sensational Francis Dunnery Electric Band, which toured both Necromandus songs and songs from the Francis Dunnery back catalogue. The band also featured on Dunnery's 2016 release Vampires, an album of re-recorded It Bites songs. Since January 2016, Dunnery has presented a weekly radio show, called 'The Francis Dunnery Radio show', on British progressive rock radio station Progzilla Radio. Personal life Dunnery has three daughters and a son from three different relationships. One of his daughters, Francine Nicholson, who he had with Jackie O'Sullivan, still lives in Cumbria where she works as a beauty therapist. He married American singer Julie Daniels (frontwoman of the rock band Star 69) on 8 December 1990 in Las Vegas, Nevada.First Name: Francis Last Name: Dunnery Gender: Male Spouse First Name: Julie Spouse Middle Name: C Spouse Last Name: Daniels Spouse Gender: Female Marriage Date: 8 December 1990 Marriage Location: Clark, NVMarriage info: Record Type: Marriage Record Instrument Number: 92705 Book: 1214 Page: C247510 Certificate Number: 1990982705 Recorded Date: 14 December 1990 Recorded County: Clark Collection: Nevada Marriage Records data Source: Nevada Department of Health and Human Services (1966‚Äì2007); collection of Nevada marriage records was provided by Nevada's Department of Health and Human Services, 4126 Technology Way, Suite 100, Carson City, Nevada 89706 The marriage ended in divorce, following which he started a relationship with Helena Faccenda, to whom songs like \\"I'm in Love\\" on the Man album were dedicated to. During their relationship they had a daughter, Ava Faccenda- Dunnery, in 1999. Around 2004 he met his girlfriend Erica Brilhart. During their relationship they had two kids, Elsie (2012) and Frankie (2015) Dunnery. Dunnery's nephew, John Dunnery (Barry Dunnery's son, and currently half of the folk-rock duo John & Wayne), has contributed to his uncle's live concerts and recordings such as Hometown 2001. Charitable work In 2002, Dunnery founded the Charlie and Kathleen Dunnery Children's Fund, a volunteer-run fundraising charity based in his hometown of Egremont, and named in honour of his late parents. Explaining his reasons for setting up the charity, Dunnery has said \\"My mother was a wonderful woman... so this is my way of honouring her and my dad. A line in one of my songs is that the only thing you get to keep is what you give away ‚Äì I like that idea. I think that by the time you are 40 if you aren't doing something to help others then you probably should be. People take all the time and I think it is nice to put something back.\\" The fund raises money for projects and activities supporting the health, wellness and educational needs of children and young people in the Egremont area.Charlie and Kathleen Dunnery Children's Fund website; accessed 14 April 2010 He continues to support the charity via regular concerts in Egremont as well as participation in and publicity for various sponsored events. In October 2012, a group of Dunnery fans collaborated on the tribute album Green And White Stripes. 14 songs, mainly from his solo career, are covered, in various styles, often differing markedly from the original. The profits from album sales go to the CKDCF.

It might be played during a larger cash game session, where the game is breaking up and only two players remain on the table, or where two players are trying to start a game and playing heads-up while waiting for other opponents. It is also a necessary phase in most sit-and-go (SNG) poker tournaments; the single remaining tournament winner will at some point have to face only a single opponent. Alternatively, heads up poker may be played on purpose, either in a cash game format, or as a SNG, where two players play a winner-take-all tournament for a fixed, previously agreed upon amount of money. On larger online poker rooms and during certain tournament series, one may stumble upon larger heads up tournaments, usually in the shoot-out format. Usually, in order to ensure the fairness of the game, all players finishing at the same level of the tournament bracket will be paid out the same amount of money, no matter what their finishing place is.  Strategy  The rules of heads up poker are the same as in a game with three or more players, except in community card poker, the blinds are usually reversed in order to decrease the positional advantage in matches between two players of similar skill. Nevertheless, the strategy employed tends to be vastly different from a multi-handed poker game. Since only two players take part in the hand, the chance of having the best hand is much higher than in a multi-handed game, which causes the game to become more aggressive than normal. Bluffs for example become easier to pull off in a heads up game since it is only necessary to bluff a single opponent in order to win the pot, whereas in a multi-handed game there is a greater risk of someone having a big hand that cannot be bluffed. In spite of the diversity of strategies one can design, it is important to remark that the heads-up limit Texas hold'em variation has been claimed to be \\"essentially weakly solved\\" in January 2015 by the Cepheus poker-playing bot. Theoretically a slightly better strategy exists but would not be able to win more than one big blind per thousand games on average. A person using that strategy would not be able to prove with statistical significance that it was better than Cepheus even with a lifetime of playing against it. The bot can be played online at poker.srv.ualberta.ca, and users can even query strategies from the software.  Tournaments In poker tournaments heads up poker is played as individual events and there are also heads up championships. Heads up poker tournaments are typically played as knock-out tournaments. An example of a heads up tournament is the National Heads-Up Poker Championship.

It was released for the PlayStation Portable on August 13, 2006 in Japan and August 29, 2006 in North America. Ultimate Ghosts 'n Goblins is the first game in the main series to employ 3D graphics, while maintaining much of the 2D gameplay mechanics of the earlier games. It also marks the return of the series' project head, Tokuro Fujiwara. The game follows the classic scenario of the heroic knight Arthur battling with demons, but includes a large number of changes. Gameplay There are three specific game modes available from the start: * Novice Mode * Standard Mode * Ultimate Mode The main game mode, Standard Mode, is a departure for the series; Arthur starts with six lives and when a player loses one of these lives, Arthur is resurrected on the spot. Arthur's armor can now resist more than one hit when it is powered up. When he eventually loses his armor and is down to his boxer shorts, he can only sustain one more hit. Ultimate Mode plays similarly to older Ghosts 'n Goblins titles; Arthur has a smaller number of lives and once he dies, he is sent back to a pre-determined point of the stage rather than being resurrected. He will either be sent back to the start, or if he travelled far enough before dying, to the stage's half-way point. In this mode, Arthur can only take one hit before losing his armor, no matter what kind he is wearing. This mode is for traditionalists and expert players. Novice Mode is an easier version of Standard Mode. Certain environmental obstacles are excluded from this mode, such as the tornadoes in the Death Castle. In addition, upon death and respawn, Arthur is given the POW power-up, which lasts until Arthur gets hit by an enemy. The levels are varied, ranging from being inside a more traditional haunted forest to volcanic pits and ruined castles. Enemies are varied and tend to be thrown at Arthur in groups, and range from zombies, ghosts, giant oxen, Venus flytraps and string dragons. There is an assortment of boss characters, some of which are quite large (two of which take up the entire screen). The game has many weapons from the past games, with a few new additions; this installment also has a new equip system. Arthur is now able to gather items that can be stored and used for different levels, ranging from what type of power Arthur can use (as a secondary attack) to standard equipment (shields, double-jump boots etc.). Arthur can also collect different types of armor, which give him varied abilities too. The magic system is no longer tethered to the armor and weapon combination; instead, \\"POW\\" pick-ups increase weapon power, and armor amplifies the magic spell Arthur has equipped (which are also gathered throughout the levels as pick-ups, hidden in chests). Instead of the linearity of the original versions, the game has now been designed so that players have to obtain a selection of Golden Rings hidden throughout the levels to access the last battle and finish the game. Players are given the option to return to earlier levels and search previously unreachable areas to find these by the use of power-ups found later on in the game. The game is designed in such a way that it is impossible to gather all the important rings and abilities in a single run, without having to return to every stage of the game at least once; this follows the series' tradition of having to beat the game twice to reach the final boss. Revised version On August 2, 2007, the game was re-released in Japan under the name Gokumakaimura Kai (Ê•µÈ≠îÁïåÊùë Êîπ), which translates roughly as \\"Extreme Demon World Village Revised.\\" This re-release contains the original game plus a redesigned version on the same disc. The redesigned version was made to fix balance issues in the original game and to adjust the gameplay to more closely resemble the arcade style of the previous entries of the series. Notable changes are re-mixed enemy locations and types, a re-worked magic system, and limited continues. The difficulty setting determines the number of lives and continues, and is referred to as \\"lifestock\\". The flow of the game was also altered to remove the RPG aspects of the original game, such as the inventory and fetch quests. Following the series' tradition, Arthur must complete all stages twice in a fixed order in order to face the final boss and complete the game. Furthermore, armor hit points have been totally removed in favor of the Ultimate Mode setting where one hit knocks off Arthur's armor. Re-spawn checkpoints now are located only at the start and half-way points of levels.

Bielsa is Newell's Old Boys' multi-use stadium in Rosario, Argentina. It didn't have any official name until December 22, 2009, when it was named after the former manager of the club Marcelo Bielsa. Until then it was simply called El Coloso del Parque (\\"The Colossus of the Park\\"), and this remained as the stadium's popular name. It is currently used mostly for football matches, but it has hosted some rugby matches sometimes, albeit rarely. The stadium was built in 1911, and has been expanded several times since. It currently holds 42,000. History =First pitch (1905)= The first pitch or \\"field\\" as it was called at that time was located between the streets Boulevard Humberto First and Avellaneda, in the northwest of the city of Rosario, in the neighborhood of the workshops. The same was achieved through management by Claudio Newell (son of Isaac Newell, founder of the club), and was opened in 1905 . It was the scene of the beginning of the meetings at that time the Football League Rosarina. The same had few amenities: had only a small box lumber modest. Due to this and the growth of the club, he found a new space for the field. =Second pitch (1907)= In 1907, thanks to the efforts of the then Mayor of Rosario, Nicasio Vila, who ceded some land, the field moved to the block between Avenue United Provinces streets, San Luis and La Rioja, in the neighborhood Vila, in the west corner of the city. =Parque de la Independencia (1911)= On July 23rd, 1911, Newell's Old Boys opened their new stadium in the Parque de la Independencia in the heart of Rosario. The stadium's design was in line with british construction designs soccer stadiums of the time. The original stadium was a wooden stand, and has in the years since had multiple additions to bring it to its current form. On July 9th, 1918, the stadium debuted its first expansion, an iron and wooden stand for 3,000 spectators, bringing total capacity to 10,000. In 1925, the club built the north end stands. On May 26th, 1929 the stadium's western stand opened, which was the first made of cement, and covered with a roof. By 1930, Newell's had a stadium that could seat 30,000 spectators. Between 1971 and 1973, the stadium was completed with cement stands, and various other improvements and expansions. In the 1990s, the club completed two new stands that elevated the stadium's capacity to 40,000, which took the nickname of \\"El coloso del parque\\"(The Colossus of the Park). The south stand was nicknamed for Diego Maradona. Since December 2008, the stadium has undergone continuous changes. At the end of 2009, the club decided to name the stadium after Marcelo Bielsa, and the Western concourse after Gerardo Martino, two managers and players who were not well treated during the time that Eduardo Jos√© L√≥pez was president of the club.

During his Dinamo career Aleksidze scored 33 goals in 71 appearances, and especially the 12 goals in 14 games in the 1999/00 season attracted the interest of bigger European clubs. He was taken on trial to English team Chelsea, who decided to buy him. Aleksidze found first team opportunities at Chelsea hard to come by, however, as he only played in two league games and one European match, all as substitute. Released by Chelsea in September 2001, he eventually returned to Dinamo where he scored nine goals in his first season. In 2004, he was bought by Russian team FC Rostov, then retired from his professional career and returned to Georgia. In July 2008 he made a comeback, playing for FC Lokomotivi Tbilisi.

The film has been credited with popularizing the Italian giallo genre. It is the first installment in the Animal Trilogy, and was followed by The Cat o' Nine Tails (1971) and Four Flies on Grey Velvet (1972). Written by Argento, the film borrowed liberally from Fredric Brown's novel The Screaming Mimi, which had previously been made into a Hollywood film, Screaming Mimi (1958), directed by Gerd Oswald. The film was nominated for an Edgar Allan Poe award for best motion picture in 1971. The film was originally cut by 20 seconds for its US release and received a 'GP' rating, though it was later re-classified as 'PG'. It has since been released in the US uncut. Upon its release the film was a huge box office hit, grossing 1,650,000,000 Italian lira (roughly about $1 million US), twice the production cost of $500,000. The film was also a success outside of Italy, gaining ‚Ç¨1,366,884 admissions in Spain.  Plot  Sam Dalmas is an American writer vacationing in Rome with his English model girlfriend Julia. Suffering from writer's block, Sam is on the verge of returning to America, but witnesses the attack of a woman in an art gallery by a mysterious black- gloved assailant dressed in a raincoat. Attempting to reach her, Sam is trapped between two mechanically-operated glass doors and can only watch as the villain makes his escape. The woman, Monica Ranieri, the wife of the gallery's owner, Alberto Ranieri, survives the attack and the local police confiscates Sam's passport to stop him from leaving the country; the assailant is believed to be a serial killer who is killing young women across the city, and Sam is an important witness. Sam is haunted by what he saw that night, feeling sure that some vital clue is evading him, and he decides to help Inspector Morosini in his investigation. He interviews the pimp of a murdered prostitute and visits a shop where one of the victims worked. There, he finds that the last thing she sold on the day of her death was a painting of a stark landscape featuring a man in a raincoat apparently murdering a young woman. He visits the artist, but finds only another dead end. As he makes his way back to his apartment, Julia is attacked by the same black-gloved figure, but Sam arrives home just in time to save her and the assailant escapes. Sam starts to receive menacing phone calls from the killer, from which the police manage to isolate an odd cricketing noise in the background, which is later revealed to be the call of a rare breed of bird from Siberia, called \\"The Bird with Crystal Plumage\\" due to the diaphanous glint of its feathers. This proves important since the only one of its kind in Rome is kept in the Italian capital's zoo, allowing Sam and the police to identify the killer's abode. There they once again find Monica Ranieri, this time struggling with her husband, Alberto, who is wielding a knife. After a short struggle, Alberto is dropped from six stories onto a concrete sidewalk below. As he dies, he confesses to the murders and tells them he loves his wife. Finding that Julia and Monica have run off, Sam goes after them, eventually coming to a darkened building. There he finds his friend Carlo murdered and Julia bound, gagged, and wounded. The assailant emerges and is revealed as Monica Ranieri. Sam suddenly realizes that he didn't actually miss anything during the first attack; he simply misinterpreted what he saw: the attack he witnessed in the gallery was not Monica being assaulted but rather Monica attacking her husband, who was wearing the raincoat. She flees and he pursues Monica to her art gallery. There, he is trapped, pinned to the floor by the release of a wall-sized sculpture of wire and metal. Unable to free himself, he is teased by the knife-wielding Monica as she prepares to kill him. As she raises her knife, the police (who were notified by Julia, who had escaped) burst in and apprehend her. Sam is freed and Monica is taken to a psychiatric hospital. The victim of a traumatic attack ten years before, seeing the painting of the attack drove her mad, causing her to identify not with the victim but with the assailant. Alberto likewise suffered from an induced psychosis, helping her to cover up the murders and committing some himself. Sam and Julia are re-united and return to America.  Cast   Release  The Bird with the Crystal Plumage was released in Italy with a 101-minute running time on 19 February 1970. It was released in Berlin, Germany with a 94-minute running time at the Gloria-Palast on 24 June 1970. In Germany it was marketed as an adaptation of a Bryan Edgar Wallace story. = Critical reception = The Bird with the Crystal Plumage has been very well received by critics. The New York Times wrote, \\"[It] has the energy to support its elaborateness and the decency to display its devices with style. Something from each of its better models has stuck, and it is pleasant to rediscover old horrors in such handsome new d√©cor. \\" Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, writing, \\"it's a pretty good [thriller]\\", but that \\"its scares are on a much more basic level than in, say, a thriller by Hitchcock.\\" The film was placed 272nd in Empire magazine's \\"500 Greatest Movies of All Time\\" list. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 93% based on 27 reviews, and an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Combining a deadly thriller plot with the stylized violence that would become his trademark, The Bird with the Crystal Plumage marked an impressive horror debut for Dario Argento.\\" = Home media = The film was originally cut by 20 seconds for its US release and received a 'GP' rating, though it was later re-classified as 'PG'. The film was later released on DVD by VCI with the restored violence, but had problems with a sequence of shots referred to as \\"the panty removal scene\\". Later pressings fixed it. Blue Underground later obtained the rights and re-released the film completely uncut, adding an extra shot of violence previously unseen. The picture was completely restored and the sound was remixed into both 5.1 audio for both Italian and English tracks, but contained another soundtrack remixed into DTS-ES 6.1 Discrete in English. Blue Underground released the film on Blu-ray Disc on 24 February 2009. Tech specs saw a BD-50 dual-layer presentation with newly remastered 1080p video and English audio tracks in DTS-HD Lossless Master Audio 7.1 Surround and Dolby TrueHD 7.1 Surround plus the original Italian audio track. It is now out-of-print. VCI announced on their Facebook page that they plan to release the film on Blu-ray Disc sometime soon and was released on September 12, 2013.

Club owner Joe Segal (April 24, 1926 ‚Äì August 10, 2020) founded the Jazz Showcase in 1947 in Chicago, Illinois and was the club's owner until his death in 2020. Born April 24, 1926 in Philadelphia, he grew up listening to Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet and Fats Waller on the radio. When he was old enough, he would visit the Earl Theater to watch them perform. The Air Force drafted Segal in 1944 and he was stationed in Champaign, Illinois for a while. When he had leave, he rode the train to Chicago to attend live jazz performances at clubs on Randolph Street. Following his military discharge, Segal moved to Chicago, enrolled in Roosevelt College on the G.I. Bill and worked at different jazz venues around the city. In 1947, he worked with his classmates, Gus Savage, who was chairman of the Social Activities Committee for Roosevelt, and Bennett Johnson to organize a weekly jam session. They presented jazz greats such Charlie Parker, Lester Young, Sonny Rollins and many others. For the next ten years he organized live jazz sessions on the school's campus featuring musicians he met working at various local jazz venues. Beginning in 1957, Segal ran his showcase shows in what he later estimated was 63 different locations over the years. By the 1970s, Segal opened a formal club called the Jazz Showcase on Rush Street.

It is about a fictional American westerner, Tully Mars, who goes to work repairing an island lighthouse. Buffett first introduced the character Tully Mars in his earlier work, Tales from Margaritaville. The book includes a CD single with a song of the same title as the book. Synopsis Tully Mars, a 40-something guide at the Lost Boys Fishing Lodge resort, takes trips around the Caribbean. Also put in charge of fixing an old lighthouse. In this novel Buffett connects stories of science fiction (Captain Kirk), fantasy (The Lost Boys), and drama (Clark Gable) into a single Caribbean-themed epic. Plot details This book picks up where the story Take Another Road from the novel Tales from Margaritaville left off. Tully Mars breaks up with his girlfriend, Donna Kay, a waitress from the Chat 'N' Chew restaurant in Heat Wave, Alabama. In the previous story, he sent her a winning lottery ticket and asked her to meet him in Belize City, a date which he failed to keep. He sails with Captain Kirk, the captain of a shrimp boat, to a mythical place known as Punta Margarita, where he becomes a fishing guide at a local resort, The Lost Boys, named after characters in Peter Pan (a lost childhood is a common theme among Buffett works). He begins to settle into a life of leisure, fishing and drinking with his Mayan friend Ix-Nay, but his world is soon turned completely upside down when Donna Kay shows up on a pink seaplane and tells him that she will marry Clark Gable, a master horse trainer featured in the previous story. He leaves Lost Boys to take a few days off after this experience, and drunkenly falls asleep on the beach, where he is robbed in his sleep. When he wakes, a 140-foot schooner, the Lucretia, is anchored nearby. When the captain, feisty 101-year-old Cleopatra Highbourne, comes ashore, they strike up a friendship immediately and Tully is offered a job as part of the crew. Initially, he turns down this offer, but after run-ins with two bounty hunters from Wyoming, where he has outstanding warrants, he finds himself on her ship just the same. It is at that point that she takes him to Cayo Loco, the salty piece of land referred to in the book's title, which is a small mythical island that is home to an old-fashioned lighthouse. Cleopatra puts Tully to work fixing up the ruin, as she intends the island to be her final resting place.

At times the key has been substantial enough to have trees, and in 1900 nine to twelve thousand terns nested on the island. At other times the island has been washed away completely. Early history The first navigational light on Sand Key was a brick tower built in 1827. After the first keeper, John Flaherty, died in 1830, his widow Rebecca took over the job. In 1844 a hurricane eroded part of the island, destroyed the keeper's house, and damaged the seawall. The Great Havana Hurricane of 1846 toppled the tower, killing Rebecca Flaherty and five others. Reconstructions and renovations As the Key West Light had also been destroyed in the same storm, a ship, the Honey, was acquired and outfitted as a lightship to serve as the Sand Key Light until new lighthouses could be built. Due to efforts to reorganize the Lighthouse Board, Congress was slow to appropriate funds for the new lighthouses. A screw-pile foundation for a new light on Sand Key was begun in 1852. Funds ran out before the foundation was complete, and the contractor had to wait seven years for final payment. Later that year Lieutenant George Meade, who had completed construction of the Carysfort Reef Light, was placed in charge of construction of the Sand Key Light. The light tower was completed in 1853. This light was the first to use the hydraulic lamp designed by George Meade. The screw-pile foundation and open framework tower allowed the lighthouse to survive later hurricanes, including one in 1856 that completely washed away all of the island above water. The light was automated in 1938. In 1967 the first order Fresnel lens was removed and replaced by a fourth order lens. That in turn was removed in 1982 and replaced with a flash tube array. The tower was severely damaged in a fire in 1989, and the light was moved to a nearby temporary structure. An attempt was made to restore the structure of the tower in 1995, but the keeper's quarters were demolished in 1996. The light was returned to the tower in 1998. The light was deactivated in 2015, and is currently being auctioned by GSA Auctions.

The ritual is performed on a full moon day. The ritual pot filled with water and adorned with decorations several feet high is carried by the priest. The dancers perform various acrobatic feats while following the procession accompanied by a number of musical instruments like 'Thavi', \\"Nadaswaram\\", \\"Muni\\", \\"Udukka\\", \\"Pamba\\", etc.  Karaga festivities of Karnataka The karaga itself is a mud pot, on which stands a tall floral pyramid that is balanced on the carrier's head. The contents of the pot have remained a secret down the centuries. The carrier's arrival is heralded by hundreds of bare-chested, dhoti-clad, turbaned Veerakumaras bearing unsheathed swords. Tradition has it that this frenzied procession of Veerakumaras accompanying the karaga carrier can execute him should he stumble and let the karaga fall. This festival that takes place in the central part of the city is called as Bangalore Karaga.  The Karaga Carrier  The Karaga carrier is taken from his home by the members of the Dharmaraya Temple. The carrier's wife takes on the role of a widow. Her mangala sutra (necklace symbolizing marriage) and bangles are worn by her husband and she is not to see him or the Karaga until the conclusion of the festival. The Tigalas, who hold Draupadi as their principal deity, believe that Draupadi Shakti (power) brims over during the Karaga festival and the Karaga carrier dressing as a female is symbolic of Draupadi. The Karaga is expertly balanced on the carrier's head. The carrier is practically in a trance even as he dances along with the Veerakumaras. The Veerakumaras hit the swords on their bare chests, saying \\"dik-di dik-di\\".  Significance  The rituals have their origin in the Mahabharata, particularly in the vastrakshepa (stripping) of Draupadi, the exile of the Pandavas and the death of Draupadi's sons at the hands of Ashwathama.

Gibbons.Gibbons, A. S., Model-Centered Instruction. Journal of Structural Learning and Intelligent Systems. 14: 511-540, 2001. This theory can be used to design individual and group instruction for all kinds of learning in any type of learning environment. In addition, this theory may be used to design instruction with a wide variety of technologies and many media delivery systems. Theory summary The theory of model- centered instruction is based on the assumption that the purpose of instruction is to help learners construct knowledge about objects and events in their environment. In the field of cognitive psychology, theorists assert that knowledge is represented and stored in human memory as dynamic, networked structures generally known as schema or mental models. This concept of mental models was incorporated by Gibbons into the theory of model-centered instruction. This theory is based on the assumption that learners construct mental models as they process information they have acquired through observations of or interactions with objects, events, and environments. Instructional designers can assist learners by (a) helping them focus attention on specific information about an object, event, or environment and (b) initiating events or activities designed to trigger learning processes. Instructional designers may guide learner attention by introducing learners to carefully selected objects and events that occur in certain environments. In some situations, it is not possible to have learners work with real objects, events, or environments. In these cases, instructional designers may create representations of the objects, events, or environments. These representations are called models. A model is a definition or representation of an object, event, or environment that includes some information regarding their properties, actions, or cause-effect relationships. Instructional designers may use a variety of models to help learners construct their own mental models. A model can take various mediated forms, from simple textual descriptions to complex, multimedia simulations. According to the theory of model-centered instruction, there are three types of models: (a) a natural or manufactured cause-effect system, (b) an environment in which one or more systems operate, or (c) an expert performance‚Äîa set of purposeful, goal-driven actions that causes changes within systems and environments. These three types of models ‚Äî system, environment, and expert performance - form a comprehensive framework for the representation and communication of subject-matter information in any domain. When learners interact with complex objects or models, they sometimes need assistance in discovering and processing information. Instructional designers can guide learners by introducing problems to be solved in a sequence that may be partially or fully determined by the learner. Gibbons defines a problem as ‚Äúa request for information about an incompletely known model. A problem is a request for the learner‚Ä¶to supply one or more of the model‚Äôs behaviors, elements, or interrelations that are missing‚Äù. Problems act as filters or masks that focus learner attention on specific information about the objects or models. Problems also trigger learning processes used in the construction of mental models. As problems are solved in sequence, learners process more information and construct more comprehensive and useful mental models.  Principles of Model-Centered Instruction  Gibbons has defined seven principles that summarize the general design prescriptions of model-centered instruction. These principles are related to the overall instructional purposes, subject-matter content, and instructional strategies of model-centered instruction. Key ideas related to designing, selecting, and sequencing problems can also be found in these principles. In addition, these principles provide guidance in how to provide supportive information, physical materials, tools, and personalized assistance to the learner. These principles, as defined by Gibbons, are listed below. 1\\\\. Experience: Learners should be given maximum opportunity to interact for learning purposes with one or more systems or models of systems of three types: environment, system, and/or expert performance. The terms model and simulation are not synonymous; models can be expressed in a variety of computer-based and non-computer-based forms. 2\\\\. Problem solving: Interaction with systems or models should be focused by the solution of one or more carefully selected problems, expressed in terms of the model, with solutions being performed by the learner, by a peer, or by an expert. 3\\\\. Denaturing: Models are necessarily denatured from the real by the medium in which they are expressed. Designers must select a level of denaturing matching the target learner‚Äôs existing knowledge and goals. 4\\\\. Sequence: Problems should be arranged in a carefully constructed sequence for modeled solution or for active learner solution. 5\\\\. Goal orientation: Problems selected should be appropriate for the attainment of specific instructional goals. 6\\\\. Resourcing: The learner should be given problem solving information resources, materials, and tools within a solution environment (which may exist only in the learner‚Äôs mind) commensurate with instructional goals and existing levels of knowledge. 7\\\\. Instructional augmentation: The learner should be given support during solving in the form of dynamic, specialized, designed instructional augmentations.

He is the son of animator Hayao Miyazaki, who is one of the co-founders of Studio Ghibli. Described as \\"reluctant\\" to follow his father's career, Gor≈ç initially worked as a landscaper for many years before entering the film business. He has directed three films ‚Äî Tales from Earthsea (2006), From Up on Poppy Hill (2011), and Earwig and the Witch (2020). Biography Miyazaki was born to animators Hayao Miyazaki and Akemi ≈åta in Tokyo. While growing up, Gor≈ç and his younger brother Keisuke found sketches of their parents' work. As a high school student, Gor≈ç thought that he \\"would never be able to reach the level [his father] has attained.\\" Gor≈ç instead decided to pursue an interest in landscape architecture. After graduating from Shinshu University's School of Agriculture, Gor≈ç later worked as a construction consultant in the planning and designing of parks and gardens. In 1998, Gor≈ç was involved in the design of the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, and served as its director from 2001 to June 2005. Animation career Miyazaki's first film was Tales from Earthsea, an adaptation of Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea book series. Written by Miyazaki and Keiko Niwa, the film stars Junichi Okada, Bunta Sugawara and Aoi Teshima. Originally joining the animation project as a consultant, Miyazaki was asked to draw the storyboards. After viewing his storyboards, producer Toshio Suzuki decided Miyazaki should direct the film. The move to direct the film caused friction between Gor≈ç and his father, who felt his son did not have the experience to direct a film; the two were said not to have spoken throughout the movie's development. See Eiga.com , June 6, 2006. Despite this, Gor≈ç Miyazaki was determined to complete the project.See Nausicaa.net Goro Miyazaki's Blog Translation (Prologue) December 13, 2005. On June 28, 2006, Gor≈ç held the first preview of the completed Tales from Earthsea, which was attended by his father. Hayao was seen to have \\"accepted Gor≈ç\\" and after, delivered to his son a message, saying the film \\"...was made honestly. It was good.\\"See Nausicaa.net Goro Miyazaki's Blog . The film was released on July 29, 2006 to positive reviews, but received mixed reviews when comparing to the other Ghibli movies, and grossed $68 million worldwide. However, Miyazaki was presented Japan's Bunshun Raspberry Award for \\"Worst Director\\", with Tales from Earthsea receiving the award for \\"Worst Movie\\", at the end of 2006.

Kyk-Over-Al is indelibly associated with the Guyanese poet and editor A. J. Seymour, the magazine's longtime editor. After Seymour's death in 1989 the editorship was assumed by poet and novelist Ian McDonald. Kyk-Over-Al was \\"a forerunner in its efforts to stimulate a Caribbean theory and practice of literary criticism, addressing such issues alanguage and the use of vernacular, audience, the influence of metropolitan culture and the role of historical awareness in establishing a shared 'West Indian' identity.\\"Maya Jaggi, \\"A. J. Seymour, 1914-1989 - Obituary\\", Artrage 27, Spring/Summer 1990, p. 1. The magazine was initially published between 1945 and 1961, ceasing publication shortly before the West Indies Federation broke up, and was revived in 1984. Founding and early years (1945‚Äì61) Kyk-Over-Al was founded in 1945 by the British Guiana Writers' Association (BGWA) and the British Guiana Union of Cultural Clubs (BGUCC), to \\"be an instrument to help forge a Guianese people, and to make them conscious of their intellectual and spiritual possibilities\\". The first issue, priced at one shilling, appeared in December 1945, and was edited by A. J. Seymour, who at that time was an executive member of the BGWA and honorary secretary of the BGUCC. The magazine was named for Kyk-Over-Al (\\"see over all\\"), the ruined Dutch fort on a small island near the confluence of the Essequibo, Mazaruni, and Cuyuni Rivers in the Guyanese interior.Laughlin, Nicholas, \\"A fort with a view: Kyk-over-Al\\", Caribbean Beat, Issue 84 (March/April 2007). As Seymour explained in his editorial notes, \\"although ruined, Kykoveral still stands to remind us of our Amerindian and Dutch heritage.... As a title for a periodical, Kykoveral calls for a quick and wide vigilance and the expression of an alert people.\\" (Seymour almost always spelled the name of the magazine as a single word, unhyphenated; but the hyphenated form Kyk-Over-Al appeared on the magazine's cover, and this is the form that has been generally accepted over the years.) Though Kyk-Over-Al began as a project of the BGWA and the BGUCC, Seymour from the beginning took a leading role in its direction and the magazine soon became his own private project‚Äîor, it might be more accurate to say it became a Seymour family project, since his wife Elma assumed responsibility for many business matters, including the advertising that made publication possible. Between 1945 and 1961, 28 issues of Kyk-Over-Al appeared, publishing the work of every important Guyanese writer of the period‚Äîmost notably Wilson Harris, Edgar Mittelholzer, Martin Carter, and Seymour himself‚Äîas well as many writers from other territories of the Anglophone Caribbean. Apart from fiction and poetry, Kyk-Over-Al published a number of groundbreaking critical essays, many written by Seymour, examining the work of West Indian writers and attempting to define the literature that began to emerge in the Caribbean in the years after World War II. Other notable critics who contributed to the magazine include Frank Collymore, Ivan Van Sertima and Kenneth Ramchand.Michael Hughes, A Companion to West Indian Literature, Collins, 1979, p. 68. In 1962, Seymour, by profession a civil servant, resigned from his position as head of government information services after a disagreement with Premier Cheddi Jagan over the political implications of his role. He accepted a post with the Caribbean Organisation, based in Puerto Rico. When he left British Guiana, Kyk-Over-Al ceased publication. In The Making of Guyanese Literature, a long essay Seymour wrote in 1980, he noted that \\"the main emphases in Kykoveral were on poetry and criticism.... The issues presented a total of nearly 500 poems in all and several numbers were devoted to anthologies of Guyanese and West Indian poetry.\\" The Kyk-Over-Al Anthology of West Indian Poetry revised by A. J. Seymour, was published in 1957. Revival (1984‚Äìpresent) Seymour returned to British Guiana in 1965 (the year before independence, when the territory was renamed Guyana), but did not resume the publication of Kyk-Over-Al. Over the next two decades he continued his cultural activities in various official and unofficial roles, and continued to write both poetry and criticism, as well as a series of autobiographical volumes. In 1984, to commemorate Seymour's 70th birthday as well as his long and crucial involvement in West Indian literary affairs, a volume called AJS at 70 was published, edited by Ian McDonald. This proved to be a trigger for the revival of Kyk-Over-Al, with McDonald assisting Seymour in the editorial duties. Seymour died in December 1989, after which McDonald became sole editor of Kyk-Over-Al, which continued to appear, somewhat irregularly, through the 1990s. In June 1990, a joint issue of Kyk- Over-Al and BIM was published, edited by John Wickham and Ian McDonald; it was noted by a reviewer: \\"Perhaps most striking about this joint issue is the ability of Ian McDonald to provide so much material, and very interesting material at that, in 'Across the Editor's Desk.' Seymour has clearly left a good heir in him.\\"Cedric Lindo, The Caribbean Writer. For recent issues, writer and cultural activist Vanda Radzik has served as co-editor of Kyk-Over- Al. A 50th-anniversary issue appeared in 1995. The most recent published issue appeared in June 2000. Although Kyk-Over-Al has not been published since then, the editors insist that the magazine is not defunct, and in 2005 work was under way on a 60th-anniversary issue.

He was also a composer, producer, and university professor. Biography Born in Shreveport, Louisiana, on July 1, 1952, Leon Ndugu Chancler was the last child of seven children from the union of Rosie Lee and Henry Nathaniel Chancler. In 1960 the family relocated to Los Angeles, California. Chancler began playing drums when he was thirteen years old. He would publicly reminisce about being asked to leave a classroom for continuously tapping on the desk, only to be later heard tapping on the poles in the hallway. His love for the drums took over while attending Gompers Junior High School and it became his lifelong ambition. He graduated from Locke High School having been heavily involved in playing there with Willie Bobo and the Harold Johnson Sextet. He graduated from California State University, Dominguez Hills with a degree in music education. By then he had already performed with the Gerald Wilson Big Band, Herbie Hancock, and recorded with Miles Davis, Freddie Hubbard, and Bobby Hutcherson. He recorded as a sideman in jazz, blues, and pop music, including instantly recognizable drums on \\"Billie Jean\\" by Michael Jackson. In 1982, he received a Grammy nomination for Best Rhythm & Blues song, for co-writing \\"Let It Whip\\" made famous by the Dazz Band. He worked with George Benson, Stanley Clarke, The Crusaders, George Duke, Herbie Hancock, John Lee Hooker, Hubert Laws, Thelonious Monk, Jean-Luc Ponty, Lionel Richie, Kenny Rogers, Patrice Rushen, Santana, Frank Sinatra, Donna Summer, The Temptations, Tina Turner, and Weather Report. In 2006, he became an Adjunct Assistant Professor of Jazz Studies at the University of Southern California and taught at the Stanford Jazz Workshop in California for three weeks every summer. He was a member of the Percussive Arts Society. Personal life and death Chancler was given the name \\"Ndugu\\" by musical icon Herbie Hancock during his time with Hancock's Mwandishi band. He was known as Leon (Ndugu) Chancler, or sometimes Ndugu Chancler. Ndugu is Swahili for ‚Äúearth brother,‚Äù a family member or comrade.http://rejuvenationmedia.com/leon-ndugu-chancler-versatile-drummer-is- actually-dead-at-65/ Ndugu grew up active in his church and was mentored and influenced by many strong men that helped shape his life after the absence of his father at age 13. His older brother Londell was a major support and motivation to him. When his mother was diagnosed with diabetes, Ndugu cared for her until her death in 1994. Chancler had one child, son Rashon Chafic Chancler, with Vicki Guess. Family was important to him and he had many godchildren, nieces, and nephews. Chancler died at his home in Los Angeles, California on February 3, 2018 of prostate cancer, at the age of 65. A song, \\"Home Light,\\" written by Ernie Watts and Marc Seales, was dedicated to Chancler. It was the title track of a 2018 album by the Ernie Watts Quartet.

It is commonly thought of as an invisible red cord around the finger of those that are destined to meet one another in a certain situation as they are \\"their true love\\". According to Chinese legend, the deity in charge of \\"the red thread\\" is believed to be Yu√® Xi√† L«éor√©n (Êúà‰∏ãËÄÅ‰∫∫), often abbreviated to Yu√® L«éo (ÊúàËÄÅ), the old lunar matchmaker god, who is in charge of marriages. In the original Chinese myth, it's tied around both parties' ankles, while in Japanese culture it's bound from a male's thumb to a female's little finger, and in Korean culture, the red thread is thought to be tied around the little finger of both parties. Although in modern times it's common across all three cultures to depict the thread being tied around the fingers, often the little finger. The color red in Chinese culture symbolises good fortune and is also the color of traditional Chinese weddings where both bride and groom would wear red throughout the entire procession or at some point during the marriage rituals. The two people connected by the red thread are destined lovers, regardless of place, time, or circumstances. This magical cord may stretch or tangle, but never break. This myth is similar to the Western concept of soulmate or a destined partner.  Folklore  One story featuring the red thread of fate involves a young boy. Walking home one night, a young boy sees an old man (Yue Xia Lao) standing beneath the moonlight. The man explains to the boy that he is attached to his destined wife by a red thread. Yue Xia Lao shows the boy the young girl who is destined to be his wife. Being young and having no interest in having a wife, the young boy picks up a rock and throws it at the girl, running away. Many years later, when the boy has grown into a young man, his parents arrange a wedding for him. On the night of his wedding, his wife waits for him in their bedroom, with the traditional veil covering her face. Raising it, the man is delighted to find that his wife is one of the great beauties of his village. However, she wears an adornment on her eyebrow. He asks her why she wears it and she responds that when she was a young girl, a boy threw a rock at her that struck her, leaving a scar on her eyebrow. She self-consciously wears the adornment to cover it up. The woman is, in fact, the same young girl connected to the man by the red thread shown to him by Yue Xia Lao back in his childhood, showing that they were connected by the red thread of fate. Another version of the same story involves an ambitious young man who talks to Yue Xia Lao and insists on asking him about who will he marry, thinking that he'll net himself a rich girl. Yue Xia Lao points at a poor-looking little girl who's taking a stroll with an old blind woman in a marketplace, shows him a red thread between the two, and tells the man that he'll marry her someday. Displeased, the man tells a servant to kill the two and then leaves the village. Years later the man, now a promising public officer, marries a beautiful woman from a rich family who is very much the perfect wife for him save for two details: she has a limp and covers her forehead with a silk patch for undisclosed reasons. He asks his wife why and she begins crying, telling him that she is the niece of the family leaders rather than their daughter: her parents died when she was young and she initially lived with her old blind nanny, but one day a madman stabbed her caretaker to death in a local marketplace and wounded her, leaving her scarred and almost crippled. The man realizes that Yue Xia Lao was right, tearfully confesses that he ordered the attack and asks his wife for forgiveness, which she gives to him. In another story, a girl has a crush on a boy and decides to declare her love for him. Unfortunately, the boy rejects her and makes fun of her. The girl runs off to a fountain where she meets Yue Xia Lao who tells her they are soul mates. The girl is still fuming and runs off. When the girl becomes a lady, she meets a young man who seems very charming and in other terms familiar to her. She then asks the man for his name and he says the name of the young boy. The lady doesn't seem to realise though and then on their special day he tells her a girl liked him but he was foolish and made fun of her for it, he then exclaims the girl had the same name as her. Realising who he was, she admits she was the girl and he eventually apologises.

It includes many early 20th century bungalow homes and historic buildings. It was an early residential area of Tampa connected by streetcar. The area had an economic downturn in the late 20th century marked by increased crime, but has since seen a resurgence with new restaurants, brew pubs and independent businesses opening up. The neighborhood's historic homes, eclectic shops and gourmet restaurants are an increasing draw. As of the 2000 census, the district had a population of 24,567. Description Gothic Style Hillsborough High School in Old Seminole Heights was built in 1927 Homes on Central Ave Seminole Heights is known for its historic craftsman style bungalows from the early 20th century. Many buildings in the neighborhood existed in the early 1900s, including the Seminole Heights Methodist Church, Seminole Heights Elementary School, Broward Elementary, Hillsborough High School, and St. Paul's Lutheran Church. The Seminole Heights Garden Center, a neighborhood park, is used for community events such as art festivals and picnics. Seminole Heights has the longest stretch of Riverfront parkland in the city of Tampa. Rivercrest, Epps, and several pocket parks provide access to the Hillsborough River. In recent years Seminole Heights has experienced rising property values and a decrease in crime. The area is popular among young professionals and their families who are seeking an alternative to master planned communities. The area contains two designated historical districts including Seminole Heights (local and national designation) and Hampton Terrace (national designation). In 2003, Southeast Seminole Heights was named Best Neighborhood in America by Neighborhoods, USA (NUSA). In July 2009, This Old House magazine ranked Seminole Heights among the best places to buy an old house for: families, green thumbs, cottages and bungalows, single women homebuyers, porch sitters, walkers, and the south. Overall, Seminole Heights was in the top eight of editors picks. The district has become known as a dining destination. Notable restaurant/ bars include Rooster and the Til, Ichicoro, the Independent Bar & Cafe', and Ella's Americana Folk Art Cafe. In 2014, Seminole Heights made international headlines http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2014/07/01/Two-headed-alligator-spotted-in- Florida/5141404226010/ when a \\"local naturalist\\" sent a picture of a two headed alligator to a local newspaper, which ran the image as its cover story. The alligator was allegedly captured by local trappers and taxidermied for display at Ella's Folkart Cafe. The authenticity of the creature has often come under question.http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/its-a-total- crock/2186639 Since the story in 2014, it has been the subject of art murals, flags, tee-shirts and other ephemera related to the neighborhood. In 2016, the creature made news again when the community art project, Urban Art Attack, funded the building of a two headed alligator statue on Nebraska Ave.http://patch.com/florida/seminoleheights/two-headed-alligator-statue- turning-heads-seminole-heights History Seminole Heights was born in 1911. T. Roy Young had to develop Tampa's first suburb three miles (5 km) north of downtown. He called it Seminole Heights. Ten years earlier Tampa's population had reached 26,000. A trolley line connected Sulphur Springs to downtown, making travel to the suburbs possible and inviting. The streetcar made it possible to live in one area of town and work in another. Young recognized this potential. His Seminole Development Corporation property encompassed a rectangle bordered by Hillsborough Avenue, Central Avenue, Wilder Avenue and Florida Avenue. The houses built here were mostly bungalow, oriented east-to- west and started at $5,000. Other developments quickly followed. By 1912, the Mutual Development Company owned by Milton and Giddings Mabry and the Dekle Investment Company owned by Lee and James Dekle surveyed and platted land adjacent to Seminole Heights forming the Suwanee Heights subdivision. Bounded by Henry Avenue, Hillsborough Avenue, Central Avenue and Florida Avenue, Suwanee Heights was also a restricted subdivision. Like the original Seminole Heights, houses required the same east/west orientation but started at $1,400. During the \\"Florida Bloom\\" years (roughly 1919-1929), more development came to areas north and east of the original subdivisions. Of course, with this development came the merchants seeing an opportunity to provide welcome goods and services to the residents. Some of those early businesses have faded away. However, many current Seminole Heights businesses have been open for more than 50 years. In October and November 2017, four people were shot dead in separate incidents while walking in the Seminole Heights neighborhood. Police believed the killings were the work of a serial killer. Tampa Police arrested a suspect, Howell Emanuel \\"Trai\\" Donaldson III, a McDonald's employee on Nov 28, 2017 in connection with the multiple murders. Areas The greater Seminole Heights area has a resident population 23,141 living in 9,433 households as of 2009. The median household income is $47,817. The median age is 37. The area is projected to grow 5.89% during 2009-2014. 47% of the population has some college level education or higher. Seventy percent 70% of the homes are owner occupied.

The Highland Chieftain, a diesel InterCity 125 service between London King's Cross and Inverness, calls at Falkirk Grahamston. There are only two of these trains per day.  History  The line between Polmont and Larbert was built by the Stirlingshire Midland Junction Railway, which was absorbed by the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway prior to opening. The line opened on 1 October 1850, as did the station known as Grahamston (Falkirk). The subsequent addition of a chord line at Carmuirs to create a triangular junction there also gave access to the Scottish Central Railway and hence the E&G; main line at Greenhill, creating a parallel relief route to the busy E&G; line that was often used by local stopping trains between the two cities. It also became the junction for the Grangemouth Railway, when the branch to the port of the same name on the Firth of Forth was opened in 1860/61 ‚Äì this line was notable in that it was promoted and built by the Forth and Clyde Canal Company rather than any of the local railways, in order to maintain the F&CC;'s monopoly of the harbour there. The branch was initially worked by the E&G;, but when the canal company was subsequently bought out by the Caledonian Railway, it passed into their hands; thereafter the E&G;'s successor the North British Railway had running powers over it. Passenger services there were withdrawn on 29 January 1968 as a result of the Beeching Axe, but the branch is still open for freight to the port and associated oil refinery and petrochemical plant. The station was renamed Falkirk Grahamston on 1 February 1903. The original station buildings were replaced by the present ones in 1985/6.  Services  Monday to Saturday there are 4 trains per hour to Edinburgh Waverley eastbound and 2-3 trains per hour westbound to via Stirling. Train times to Edinburgh Waverley vary from 25 minutes to 34 minutes; faster trains stop at Edinburgh Park and Haymarket, slower trains additionally stop at Polmont and Linlithgow. There are also 2 trains per hour to and from via , with journey times from 39 minutes to 43 minutes. There is also a single weekday morning peak direct service to Glasgow which originates at ; this returns to Markinch in the evening, with an evening journey time of 26 minutes.GB National Rail Timetable 2016, Table 230 (Network Rail) Glasgow services were diverted via Cumbernauld (rather than their former routing via ) in September 1999UK NRT Autumn 1999 Edition, Table 230 in order to free up paths on the busy E&G; main line. On Sundays there is an hourly service to Edinburgh and Dunblane but no service to Glasgow. Passengers wishing to travel there have to either change at or use . Recent Improvements The line through the station and onwards to Larbert/Cumbernauld and to Polmont was electrified in 2018 as part of the second phase of the Edinburgh to Glasgow Improvement Programme funded by Transport Scotland. This has resulted in a timetable recast, with a new Glasgow to Edinburgh via Cumbernauld & Falkirk Grahamston stopping service introduced and services to Edinburgh, Stirling & Dunblane accelerated.

It was a simpler, less expensive version of the high- end Rolleiflex TLR, aimed at amateur photographers who wanted a high-quality camera but could not afford the expensive Rolleiflex. Several models of Rolleicord were made; the later models generally had more advanced features and tend to be valued higher in today's market. The first Rolleicord, introduced in November 1933, was the Rolleicord I. This camera was a simplified version of the Standard Rolleiflex, with a cheaper 75mm Zeiss Triotar lens and a simplified film advance mechanism using a knob instead of the crank found on the Rolleiflex. The Rolleicord I was available either with a plain leatherette covering or elaborately patterned metal faceplates. The latter variant is referred to as the \\"Art Deco\\" Rolleicord. The models that has the letters DRP on the left and to the right DRGM on the front of the camera means that they were made before World War II, because DRP means 'Deutsches Reichs Patent' (German Reich Patent) and DRGM means 'Deutsches Reichs Gebrauchs Muster' (basically a copyright for the name).

However, while the Rolleiflex was available with an f/2.8 lens, the Rolleicord was never offered with a larger aperture than f/3.5, thus ensuring its pedigree as an \\"amateur\\" camera. An accessory, known as a Rolleikin kit, was available for the Rolleicord to enable it to accept 35mm film.

The drug smuggler Howard Marks was a student at Balliol College, Oxford while Frances was at Somerville. In his autobiography Mr. Nice he describes her as \\"vivacious\\". The book contains an anecdote of Marks taking LSD for the first time before visiting Frances in her rooms. While they sat listening to The Rolling Stones, Marks described to her the trip he was experiencing. Career In 1970 she started work as an Assistant Editor at the London publishing firm of Studio Vista. She went on to become its managing director. From Studio Vista she moved to a job with the publisher Marshall Cavendish, and from there to Weidenfeld and Nicolson, where she was given her own imprint. A story that followed her throughout her career, often passed on from employees to new recruits, was of the staff-walkout and demonstration she headed while at Studio Vista in 1975. This was a protest against redundancies proposed by Collier Macmillan, the firm that had come to own Studio Vista. The protest went on for a number of days, and is described as a strike. It achieved concessions from Collier Macmillan. (The story itself is striking for the incongruity between the shy and reserved bluestocking figure of Frances Lincoln, and the tale's casting of her in the role of \\"strike leader\\".) In 1977 Frances went out on her own as an independent publisher/packager, publishing both under her own name and in co-editions. The firm she founded continues as Frances Lincoln Publishers, based in London.About Us, franceslincoln.com (archive copy). Retrieved 9 October 2020. The firm is known for the list of illustrated gardening books it publishes, and for the illustrated children's books that it began publishing from 1983, many of which have won awards and prizes. In Frances's time, her firm was notable for employing an almost exclusively female staff. Frances Lincoln died from pneumonia at age 55 in 2001. Family Frances married John Nicoll, the author of the first book she had commissioned. (He later headed Yale University Press in the UK). The couple had a son and two daughters.

In Wolfgang Schmieder's catalogue of Bach's works (BWV) it was assigned the number 198. It is also known as ' or as '.  History and text  Bach wrote several works for celebrations of the Leipzig University, Festmusiken zu Leipziger Universit√§tsfeiern. Christiane Eberhardine, Electress of Saxony, for whose funeral the cantata was written He composed this cantata at the request of the University as a funeral ode for Christiane Eberhardine, wife of August II the Strong, the Elector of Saxony and King of Poland. The cantata was first performed on 17 October 1727 in the University Church in Leipzig. Bach himself directed from the harpsichord. The text was written by Johann Christoph Gottsched, professor of philosophy and poetry. The text is purely secular, proclaiming how the kingdom is in shock over the princess' death, how magnificent she was, and how sadly she will be missed. Sacred elements pertaining to salvation and the afterlife are absent. Bach, however, as was his custom, included a cryptic reference to salvation in the music. The first movement of the second section Der Ewigkeit saphirnes Haus (\\"Eternity's sapphiric house\\"), which was performed following the oration, contains underlying elements of the first movement of the cantata BWV 56, Ich will den Kreuzstab gerne tragen (\\"I want to bear the cross\\") which Bach had composed one year earlier. The measures 70‚Äì75 contain a direct quote (played by the oboe) of the bass solo voice in measures 91‚Äì98 from BWV 56 where the text is Der f√ºhret mich nach meinen Plagen zu Gott, in das gelobte Land (\\"which leads me to God in the promised land after all my tribulation\\"). In the introduction to the opening chorus, Bach expresses the reluctance to bid the final farewell to the Queen by prolonging the harmonies in a manner unusual even for him. After the opening chord he avoids resolving back to the finality of the tonic for ten bars, employing deceptive cadences, Neapolitan chord, and other furtive resolutions. This mirrors and enhances the intended longing of the opening text \\"Princess, let one more beam of light shine\\". The word \\"Strahl\\" (\\"beam [of light]\\") is sung in straight rising notes, while \\"Tr√§nen\\" (\\"tears\\") is sung in falling, cascading notes, similar to \\"Tr√§nen\\" in the closing chorus of the St Matthew Passion, BWV 244: Wir setzen uns mit Tr√§nen nieder (\\"We sit down in tears\\"). The word \\"F√ºrstin\\" (\\"princess\\", also generic for \\"royal lady\\") is always sung isolated from the rest of the text, surrounded by rests. Bach later borrowed from the cantata for his Markus- Passion and for Klagt, Kinder, klagt es aller Welt, BWV 244a, another funeral ode written in 1729.  Scoring and structure  The cantata is scored for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor, bass), a four-part choir, two flutes, two oboes d'amore, two violins, viola, two violas da gamba, two lutes and basso continuo. The ten movements are divided into two parts, to be performed before and after the funeral oration. :First part #Chorus: '''' #Recitative (soprano): '''' #Aria (soprano): '''' #Recitative (alto): '''' #Aria (alto): '''' #Recitative (tenor): '''' #Chorus: '''' :Second part # * Aria (tenor): ' #Recitative (bass): '''' #Chorus: ''''  Selected recordings  * J.S.

He patented a new design for arch bridges. Marsh gave Archie Alexander, the first African-American to graduate as an engineer from the University of Iowa, his first job. Marsh worked in the bridge building business for over 50 years, and several of his bridges are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Personal life and early career Marsh was born on April 12, 1856, in North Lake, Wisconsin. He moved to Iowa sometime around 1877, later enrolling at Iowa State University, and he received a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering in 1882. Within the next year, he traveled to Des Moines, Iowa, to work as a contracting agent for the King Bridge Company of Cleveland, Ohio. He married and had three children. Later career Marsh was the representative of King Bridge Company in 1883 and the Kansas City Bridge and Iron Company in 1886. In 1889, Marsh became the western general agent for the King Bridge Company. Marsh had already had many bridges completed in Iowa, including a three-mile railroad structure in Sioux City and three bridges in Des Moines. His other bridges were in Montana, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Colorado. He became an independent bridge designer and contractor in 1896, but he still had his prior contacts with bridge companies to receive materials. Within a few years after the introduction of a new type of bridge construction involving reinforced concrete, Marsh worked on applying reinforced concrete to urban bridges. In 1901, he was an engineer of a Melan arch bridge in Waterloo, Iowa, which finished construction in 1903. Marsh wrote about reinforced concrete girder bridges, which were published in works by the International Engineering Congress in St. Louis in 1904. Throughout the first decade of the 1900s, Marsh built more bridges that were made out of reinforced concrete and steel. His company was named the Marsh Bridge Company, and it provided bridges to cities and rural areas. The bridges included a reinforced concrete wagon bridge in Greene County and Melan bridge in Cedar Rapids. In the beginning of 1909, the Marsh Bridge Company was taken over by someone else, and the Marsh Engineering Company was started soon after. In May 1909, a Melan arch bridge in Peoria, Illinois collapsed and Engineering News said that the collapse was \\"the largest recorded failure of a reinforced- concrete bridge\\". The bridge collapse was likely caused by someone removing protective sheet piling without authorization. In November 1909, Marsh's new company finished building an arch bridge in Dunkerton, Iowa. The Melan bridges that were built by Marsh and others required royalties to be paid to the American holders of the patent. The added cost of paying royalties made the cost of building such bridges with reinforced concrete very high. Marsh did not want to pay the royalties, so he built his own design for a reinforced concrete highway bridge, which later became known as the Marsh Rainbow Arch. His rainbow arch bridges were designed to be built without any supporting scaffolding. On August 12, 1912, Marsh received a patent for the design. The design used less labor, and it used a lesser amount of concrete. Steel that would be used for reinforcing bridges was cheap. Marsh's patented work allowed rural townships to have bridges that resembled the ones used over rivers in bigger cities. The patent was described as being \\"to construct an arch bridge of reinforced concrete in such a manner as to permit a limited amount of expansion and contraction both of the arches and of the floor\\". Marsh continued to building rainbow arches and other types of reinforced concrete arch bridges. Possibly the largest rainbow arch bridge that he built was the Cotter Bridge in Arkansas, which was completed in 1930. He collaborated with other engineers to create \\"Minimum Specifications for Highway Bridges\\" for the Iowa Engineering Society, which was completed in 1914. Marsh's son, Frank E. Marsh, owned a construction company that often received the contracts for building bridges that were designed by Marsh. Marsh gave Archie Alexander, the first African-American to graduate as an engineer from the University of Iowa, his start. Alexander worked under Marsh for two years and later built his own projects nationwide. Marsh was a bridge builder for over fifty years. Death and legacy Several of Marsh's bridges remain and are listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Marsh died on June 26, 1936.

Irving Kristol, Irving Howe, Seymour Martin Lipset, Leslie Fiedler and Nathan Glazer were members of the Trotskyist Young People's Socialist League.Alexander Bloom: Prodigal Sons. The New York Intellectuals and Their World, Oxford University Press: NY / Oxford 1986, p. 109. Overview Writers often identified as members of this group include Hannah Arendt, William Barrett, Daniel Bell, Saul Bellow, Elliot Cohen, Midge Decter, Leslie Fiedler, Nathan Glazer, Clement Greenberg, Paul Goodman, Richard Hofstadter, Sidney Hook,Michael HOCHGESCHWENDER \\"The cultural front of the Cold War: the Congress for cultural freedom as an experiment in transnational warfare\\" Ricerche di storia politica, issue 1/2003, pp. 35-60 Irving Howe, Alfred Kazin, Irving Kristol, Seymour Martin Lipset, Mary McCarthy, Dwight Macdonald, William Phillips, Norman Podhoretz, Philip Rahv, Harold Rosenberg, Isaac Rosenfeld, Delmore Schwartz, Susan Sontag, Harvey Swados, Diana Trilling, Lionel Trilling, and Robert Warshow. Many of these intellectuals were educated at City College of New York (\\"Harvard of the Proletariat\\"), New York University, and Columbia University in the 1930s, and associated in the next two decades with the left-wing political journals Partisan Review and Dissent, as well as the then-left-wing but later neoconservative-leaning journal Commentary. Writer Nicholas Lemann has described these intellectuals as \\"the American Bloomsbury\\". Some, including Kristol, Hook, and Podhoretz, later became key figures in the development of Neoconservatism.

Stylistically, they were similar to blues-based bands, such as The Yardbirds, The Pretty Things and the Rolling Stones, playing basic R&B; on their first album The Sect. Critic Richie Unterberger wrote: \\"The Sect didn't as much interpret the sound of Chess Records as attack it, with a finesse that made the Pretty Things seem positively suave in comparison.\\" History In 1962, Mick O' Donnell, later known as Don Craine, started a band called the Downliners, who, despite touring France, were unsuccessful. The name of the band came from Jerry Lee Lewis B-side 'Down The Line'. After several lineup changes, the band folded, but in 1963, O'Donnell and drummer Johnny Sutton formed a new band out of the remnants of the previous act. Keith Evans, formerly a drummer, joined on bass guitar. Shortly thereafter the band would be named the Downliners Sect. At this time some of the members decided to change their names. Mick O'Donnell took the new name, Don Craine, and Keith Evans became Keith Grant. The band was iconic during its time in the early 1960s, partly owing to Don Craine's deerstalker cap which he wore to mock the aristocracy. The band has many fans who have achieved commercial success, including Van Morrison, Steve Marriott, and Rod Stewart, the latter two had even auditioned for a place in the band but were turned down because they both wanted to be frontmen, while Don Craine and Keith Grant did not wish to relinquish that role. They subsequently modified their musical style, and after an EP of 'sick' songs (e.g. \\"I Want My Baby Back\\"), they experimented with both country (\\"The Country Sect\\") and rock (\\"Rock Sect's In\\"). They later collaborated with Billy Childish's Thee Headcoats, and released two albums under the name Thee Headcoats Sect. They performed regularly at the Studio 51 club in Great Newport Street near Leicester Square tube station in London on a Friday night and Sunday afternoon, from which came the first EP featuring the songs \\"Beautiful Delilah\\" and \\"Little Egypt\\". The EP started off with the sound of the bells of Big Ben. The lead guitarist was Terry Clemson (Gibson) who played his Gibson 335. Studio 51 was also known as the Ken Colyer Club and the Rolling Stones made many performances at this club, but according to Rod Harrison, guitarist with Asgaerd and school friend of Terry Clemson, \\"you could say the Downliners Sect were almost residents.\\" Members ;Current members *Keith Grant ‚Äì vocals/bass *Don Craine ‚Äì vocals/guitar *Del Dwyer ‚Äì vocals/guitar *John O'Leary ‚Äì vocals/harp *Mark Freeman ‚Äì drums ;Past members *Al Brooks ‚Äì drums *Barry Cooper ‚Äì keyboards *Rod De'Ath ‚Äì drums *Matt Fisher ‚Äì keyboards *Kevin Flanagan ‚Äì drums *Terry Clemson ‚Äì lead guitar (died- Sept.19,2020) *Pip Harvey ‚Äì harmonica *Paul Holm ‚Äì drums *Mel Lewis ‚Äì lead guitar *Nat Maynard ‚Äì keyboard *Ray Sone ‚Äì harmonica *John Sutton ‚Äì drums *Bob Taylor ‚Äì lead guitar *Paul Tiller ‚Äì harmonica *Zach Wilson ‚Äì guitar *Paul Martinez ‚Äì vocals/bass * Mike Chapman ‚Äì vocals/guitar Discography =Singles= *Jun 1964 ‚Äì \\"Baby What's Wrong\\" / \\"Be A Sect Maniac\\" (Columbia DB 7300) *Sep 1964 ‚Äì \\"Little Egypt (Ying-Yang)\\" / \\"Sect Appeal\\" (Columbia DB 7347) *Nov 1964 ‚Äì \\"Find Out What's Happening\\" / \\"Insecticide\\" (Columbia DB 7415) *??? 1965 ‚Äì \\"Wreck of the Old '97\\" / \\"Leader of the Sect\\" (Columbia DB 7509) *Jun 1965 ‚Äì \\"I Got Mine\\" / \\"Waiting in Heaven Somewhere\\" (Columbia DB 7597) *Oct 1965 ‚Äì \\"Bad Storm Coming\\" / \\"Lonely And Blue\\" (Columbia DB 7712) *Jan 1966 ‚Äì \\"All Night Worker\\" / \\"He Was A Square\\" (Columbia DB 7817) *Jun 1966 ‚Äì \\"Glendora\\" / \\"I'll Find Out\\" (Columbia DB 7939) *Sep 1966 ‚Äì \\"The Cost of Living\\" / \\"Everything I've Got To Give\\" (Columbia DB 8008) =7\\" EPs= *\\"Nite in Gt.

History  The station was built by the Scottish Central Railway, opening on 1 March 1848. It is located on the main line from to Stirling and near to the triangular junction with the line to and Edinburgh Waverley. The SCR as first constructed linked the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway main line at Greenhill with the Scottish Midland Junction Railway, with branches subsequently constructed to on the E&GR; (the Stirlingshire Midland Junction Railway) in 1850 and to Denny in 1858. Both lines had triangular junctions with the main line, giving access from the south as well as from Larbert. The Denny branch was also linked into the Kilsyth and Bonnybridge Railway from 1882, providing an alternative route to Glasgow via Kirkintilloch and to via the Kelvin Valley Railway. The station also served as the interchange for the South Alloa branch of the SCR from its opening in 1853, which was subsequently linked to the Alloa Railway via and a swingbridge over the River Forth from 1885. The Polmont line remains in use today by services to and from Edinburgh, but the Denny line was closed to passengers by the London and North Eastern Railway on 28 July 1930,Railscot - Denny Branch www.railbrit.co.uk; Retrieved 2013-10-16 with the Kilsyth branch following suit on 1 February 1935. Freight traffic to Denny and the power station at Bonnybridge continued until 1971. Passenger traffic to over the South Alloa line was withdrawn as a result of the Beeching Axe on 29 January 1968, though line as far as Throsk remained in use for M.O.D freight traffic until April 1978. Railscot - Alloa Railway chronology www.railbrit.co.uk; Retrieved 2013-10-16 The station building features a plaque commemorating the Quintinshill rail disaster in 1915, as it was from here that the ill-fated troop train involved in the accident originated.  Location  The station comprises two platforms - one serving northbound services via Stirling, and southbound services via Edinburgh and Glasgow - linked by a covered walkway. Goods loops exist immediately to the north of the station - which today are mainly used by freight services, to allow faster passenger trains to overtake. The station was modernised in the late 1970s with the two major platforms extended in 2004 along with additional security and information signage.

This brewery grew significantly after WWII due to an increase in inventory orders from other brewing industries who were merging during the 50s and 60s. Although it met its decline shortly after the UK Monopolies Commission required large breweries to break apart their monopolies, \\"The Taunton Cider Company\\" was successfully re-registered by cider enthusiasts in 2015, and began production in 2016. Its cider is produced in Somerset county which has a rich history of cider production, going back to the late 17th to 19th centuries where cider was considered a currency and farmers would sometimes be paid their daily wage with cider. Unusually, it is remembered most fondly for its advertisements, which had the strapline \\"It's not red, and there's no rocks in it\\". The original ending, \\"It doesn't taste like cider\\" was dropped. In 1990, a series of TV adverts, directed by John Lloyd, were produced in the style of Police Squad! (but titled as Fraud Squad!) and starred Leslie Nielsen in a role similar to, but not namechecked as, that of Detective Frank Drebin. The titles of each advert followed the Police Squad! joke style of having a different title in the voice-over than what appeared captioned on screen. Hank Marvin made a cameo appearance in one advert (after Nielsen's character shouts \\"Hey you over there in the shadows!\\") References Category:Somerset ciders Category:Brands of cider ","title":"Red Rock Cider"},{"id":"3658345","text":"right A skatemill is a practice utility machine for ice hockey professional players to improve their skating techniques, which is very important to achieve the level of skating ability to play on an NHL team. Skatemills resemble standard runners' treadmills, but wider, longer, and rather than a gripping rubber belt, skatemills have specially designed surfaces that allow players to practice skating techniques on a surface that resembles ice. Skatemills have variable speeds, usually topping out at between 20 and 30 miles per hour, and can also be set to varying inclines to add to the difficulty for the person training. Often, skatemills will include handgrips and a harness system to keep the players from falling while on the skatemill. Skatemills are currently only commonly found in the training facilities of NHL teams; for example, there is a skatemill in Vancouver for the players of the Vancouver Canucks, and one in Troy, Michigan for the benefit of the Detroit Red Wings. The skatemill has yet to be introduced widely to European hockey players. Skatemills are becoming very common in hockey training centers on North America as well as in fitness centers. Some companies have created low profile commercial fitness models. These models can be found in fitness centers and gyms around North America. As of today there are more than 100 skating treadmills around the world.

The state highway runs from Taylors Island east to the Delaware state line in Hickman, where the highway continues as Delaware Route 16 (DE 16). MD 16 connects Cambridge with several communities in northern Dorchester County and southwestern Caroline, including East New Market and Preston. The state highway runs concurrently with U.S. Route 50 (US 50) near Cambridge, MD 331 between East New Market and Preston, and both MD 404 and MD 313 near Andersontown. MD 16 was constructed between Church Creek and Preston as one of the original state roads in the early and mid-1910s. The highway was extended in both directions in the late 1910s: north to what was to be designated MD 313 near Denton and west to Taylors Island. MD 16 was extended through Andersontown to the Delaware state line in the early 1930s. MD 16's bypass of Cambridge was constructed in the mid-1960s. Route description MD 16 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from Dailsville Road at the western city limit of Cambridge east to US 50 in Cambridge. The highway is also a part of the main National Highway System along its concurrencies with US 50 near Cambridge and MD 404 near Denton. =Dorchester County= View north along MD 16 at MD 14 in East New Market MD 16 begins on Taylors Island a short distance west of the bridge over Slaughter Creek to the mainland. The roadway continues west as county-maintained Hoopers Neck Road, which provides access to the historic Ridgeton Farm, Grace Episcopal Church Complex, and Bethlehem Methodist Episcopal Church. MD 16 heads northeast from the island as two-lane undivided Taylors Island Road. The state highway crosses Parsons Creek and passes through the hamlets of Madison and Woolford on its way to the town of Church Creek, where MD 16 intersects MD 335 (Golden Hill Road). A park and ride lot is located south of this intersection. MD 16 continues northeast as Church Creek Road toward Cambridge, where the state highway intersects MD 341 (Race Street), which is the old alignment of MD 16, just beyond Cambridge-South Dorchester High School along the southern edge of the city. MD 16 continues east and intersects Woods Road at a roundabout and the Seaford Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad, then curves north to US 50 (Ocean Gateway). The state highway joins US 50 in a concurrency along the four-lane divided highway. US 50 and MD 16 intersect Bucktown Road, which leads southeast to Cambridge-Dorchester Airport, and both ends of MD 750 (Old Route 50) before reaching the eastern end of the concurrency in the community of Whitehall, also known as Mount Holly. MD 16 heads northeast from US 50 as two-lane undivided Mount Holly Road. As the state highway approaches East New Market, the western terminus of MD 14 (Secretary Road) heads north toward Secretary and MD 392 (East New Market Bypass) heads northeast toward Hurlock. MD 16 turns north into the town, where the highway passes through the East New Market Historic District as Main Street. The state highway intersects MD 14 (Railroad Avenue) before leaving town as East New Market Ellwood Road. MD 16 crosses the Warwick River and Cabin Creek before meeting MD 331 (Waddells Corner Road) at Waddells Corner. MD 16 joins MD 331 in a concurrency that crosses Gravel Creek and passes Beulah Road, the old alignment of MD 16 and MD 331 through Ellwood. After an at-grade crossing of the Preston Branch of the Seaford Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad, the two state highways intersect MD 318 (Preston Road) and continue northwest as Preston Road, which passes near the Jacob and Hannah Leverton House before crossing Hunting Creek into Caroline County. =Caroline County= Markers for MD 16, MD 313, and MD 404 along their triple concurrency near Andersontown The MD 16-MD 331 concurrency continues northwest through Linchester, where the highway passes both ends of MD 817 (Linchester Road), which provides access to the historic Linchester Mill. The state highways continue through the town of Preston as Main Street. Unsigned MD 324 (Maple Avenue) heads south from MD 16 and MD 331 before the two highways split on the west side of town. MD 16 heads north as Harmony Road through the hamlet of Grove and intersects MD 578 (Bethlehem Road) in the community of Harmony. The state highway crosses Fowling Creek and Robins Creek and passes through the hamlet of Two Johns, which is also known as Bureau. As MD 16 passes to the west of Williston Lake, an impoundment of Mill Creek, the highway closely parallels its old alignment, MD 617\\\\. The state highway passes through the Williston Mill Historic District just east of the community of Williston, which contains the historic homes Potter Hall and Memory Lane. MD 16 continues northeast until reaching an intersection with MD 404 and MD 313 (Shore Highway) south of Denton. MD 16 turns southeast onto Shore Highway, a four-lane divided highway that reduces to two lanes east of the intersection, to form a triple state highway concurrency. The three state highways continue east to Andersontown, where MD 313 heads south as Federalsburg Highway. A short distance to the east, MD 404 continues straight southeast while MD 16 turns northeast onto Greenwood Road. Shortly thereafter, MD 16 reaches its eastern terminus at the Delaware state line in Hickman. The highway continues east as DE 16 (Hickman Road) toward Greenwood. History The portion of MD 16 between Church Creek and East New Market via Cambridge was chosen as one of the original state roads by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909. The portion of the highway between Bureau and the western junction with MD 313 and MD 404 south of Denton was also included in the planned state road system; that piece of highway was the first part of modern MD 16 completed in 1910. MD 16 was completed from Mount Holly to East New Market in 1911, from Cambridge to Mount Holly in 1913, from East New Market to Preston via Linchester in 1914, and from Church Creek to Cambridge in 1915. The gap in the state highway within East New Market was closed in 1917. The segment of highway between Preston and Grove was surfaced by 1915. MD 16 between Grove and Bureau was under construction by 1919 and finished around 1920. The state highway was constructed from the bridge to Taylor's Island to Church Creek between 1917 and 1919. When numbers were assigned to state highways in Maryland in 1927, MD 16 had a concurrency with US 213 between Waddell's Corner and Preston. Greenwood Road from MD 404 in Andersontown to the Delaware state line was built between 1930 and 1933, concurrent with the completion of the connecting section of MD 404. MD 16 was extended north and east through Andersontown to the Delaware state line by 1939, giving the state highway additional concurrencies with MD 313 and MD 404\\\\. Also in 1939, US 213 between Easton and Vienna was transferred to a new route via Cambridge; the old portion of US 213 was designated MD 331 and the new section of US 213 became concurrent with MD 16 between Cambridge and Mount Holly. Within Cambridge, MD 16 followed Race Street north to Washington Street, which the highway followed east toward Mount Holly. The next changes in MD 16 occurred in the 1950s. MD 16 was extended west across Slaughter Creek to Taylors Island when a new bridge was completed in 1950. MD 313 was moved to its present alignment between Federalsburg and Denton in 1954; as a result, MD 16 became the sole route from Bureau to MD 404 south of Denton and part of a triple concurrency from there to Andersontown. US 50, which had replaced US 213 from Ocean City to Wye Mills in 1949, was expanded to a divided highway along its concurrency with MD 16 by 1955. MD 331 and MD 16 were realigned around Ellwood and Linchester around 1960. MD 16 was relocated to bypass Cambridge in 1967; the state highway's old route through the city was transferred to newly designated MD 341 and an extension of MD 343 east to US 50. MD 16 was relocated at Williston Lake shortly after the construction of a new bridge across the lake's outlet, Mill Creek, in 1968. The state highway was straightened out through Madison in 1970, leaving behind Old Madison Road. In 2018, a roundabout was constructed at Woods Road. Junction list Auxiliary route MD 16A is the designation for the section of Beauchamp Branch Road between MD 16 and its old alignment, MD 617, just south of Williston Lake near Williston.

The ship was originally named Puget Sound, however it was renamed on 5 June 1944, before it was launched on 18 June 1944. Salisbury Sound was sponsored by Mrs. John D. Price, and commissioned on 26 November 1945, Capt. Doyle G. Donaho in command. She was named after the Salisbury Sound; a sound near Sitka, Alaska and until her decommissioning was affectionately referred to by her crewmembers as the \\"Sally Sound\\" .  History  After shakedown, Salisbury Sound departed San Diego on 12 February 1946 and commenced her first of 19 deployments to the western Pacific, where she served during a portion of every year from 1946 through 1966. The seaplane tender operated at Okinawa, Shanghai, and Tsingtao from March through October 1946. From April into September 1947, she voyaged Okinawa, Tsingtao, and Guam; and later, from May into September 1948, she sailed to Yokosuka, Tsingtao, and Shanghai. Upon completion of several west coast operations in 1949, she steamed to Hong Kong later that year and returned to San Diego on 13 June 1950. On 26 July 1950, soon after North Korean forces invaded South Korea, Salisbury Sound sailed from San Diego. After delivering cargo to Yokosuka and Okinawa, she tended planes at Iwakuni, Japan, and at Okinawa from September into December. Her planes performed reconnaissance work in the Korean area and in the Taiwan Strait. After returning to San Diego on 31 March 1951, she sailed on 1 August, and served at Boko Ko in the Pescadores Islands, at Okinawa, and at Iwakuni, before returning to San Diego on 16 April 1952. Departing Long Beach on 15 August, she again tended planes at Okinawa, before arriving at Alameda, California, on 25 March 1953. USS Salisbury Soung (AV-13) with VP-40 Marlins at Cam Ranh Bay 1966 From 1954 through 1966, Salisbury Sound operated frequently at Okinawa, and also at Taiwan and Luzon. She served as flagship of the Formosa Patrol Force during the evacuation of the Tachen Islands in February 1955, and later as flagship of the Taiwan Patrol Force. Effective 1 August 1963, her homeport was changed from Alameda Naval Air Station, California, to NAS Whidbey Island, Washington at the seaplane base where she carried and tended to the P5M Marlin. Voyaging to Vietnam, she visited Saigon in the spring of 1959. She steamed to Da Nang, C√¥n S∆°n Island, and Ch√†m Islands in 1965, and to Cam Ranh Bay in 1966. She also participated in Operation Market Time. Decommissioned on 31 March 1967, the \\"Sally Sound\\" was transferred to the Maritime Administration on 3 July 1968 and entered the National Defense Reserve Fleet, Olympia, Washington, where she remained until sold to Zidell Explorations, Inc., of Portland, Oregon, on 7 February 1972. The vessel's commissioning plaque was saved and is currently on board the museum ship USS Hazard in Omaha, NE. Salisbury Sound received four campaign stars for service in Vietnam.

He played college football for the University of Southern Mississippi. He was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft, and also played for the NFL's New England Patriots. Early years Thomas attended Central Coosa High School in Rockford, Alabama and was a letterman in football and basketball. In football, as a senior, he was named as a Class 4A all-state selection by the Birmingham News and as an honorable mention Class 4A all-state selection by the Montgomery Advertiser. In basketball, as a senior, he led his team to the State Title and was named the Alabama Class 4A Player of the Year. College career Thomas attended from the University of Southern Mississippi, where he was a star defensive end for coach Jeff Bower's Southern Miss Golden Eagles football team. Thomas led one of the top defenses in college football, notching Conference USA Defensive Player of the Year honors his junior and senior years. The Golden Eagles won three Conference USA championships (1996, 1997, and 1999) in his four years in Hattiesburg, losing only two conference games and winning two Liberty Bowls. Thomas was named a Freshman All-American by the Sporting News in 1996, leading the Golden Eagles to an 8-3 record and a share of the Conference USA title. Southern Miss finished 9-3 in Thomas' sophomore season, en route to a Conference USA Championship and a victory in the Liberty Bowl. Thomas was named to the All-Conference first team. Statistically speaking, Thomas' best season came in 1998, when he tallied 71 tackles, in addition to a conference- high 12.5 sacks and 20 tackles-for-loss. Thomas was named a first team All- American and tied for Defensive Player of the Year. Thomas earned third-team All-American and Defensive Player of the Year honors as a senior, in addition to being named the MVP of the 1999 Liberty Bowl. He was also named as a finalist for the Conerly Trophy. Thomas was also a power forward on the Golden Eagles' basketball team in the 1995‚Äì96 and 1996‚Äì97 seasons, making him the first player in USM history to play both football and basketball. Professional career =Baltimore Ravens= Thomas was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the sixth round (186th overall) in the 2000 NFL Draft. Competing with Peter Boulware and Michael McCrary for playing time, Thomas made only 89 tackles in his first three years. He was inactive for 12 games in his rookie season, but played in all 16 games in the 2001 season, starting two at defensive end. In 2002, he started 12 games at defensive end, recording two interceptions as well as 15 special teams tackles. In 2003, Thomas was recognized for his special teams play and was selected to his first Pro Bowl. That year, he registered 34 tackles, 8 passes defended, 4 sacks, and a forced fumble. He was placed on injured reserve by the Ravens on December 17, but still led the team with 23 special teams tackles. In 2004, Thomas started all 16 games for the first time in his career. While still collecting 16 special teams tackles, he amassed 72 tackles, 4 forced fumbles, 5 passes defended, an interception and 8 sacks. In 2005, with Boulware relegated to situational pass-rush duty, Thomas was named the starting outside linebacker, where he accumulated 84 total tackles and 9 sacks. He also saw limited time at cornerback during that season. He had two interceptions on the year and three forced fumbles; he returned three turnovers for touchdowns, making him the NFL's leader in non-offensive touchdowns that season. Thomas earned his second Pro Bowl bid in 2006 as part of a Ravens defense that finished first in the league en route to a 13‚Äì3 record. He was a first-team All-Pro after setting a career-high with 106 tackles and 11 sacks, as well as notching 1 INT, 1 safety, 7 passes defensed, and 1 fumble recovery returned 57 yards for a touchdown. It proved to be, without a doubt, his finest season as a pro. =New England Patriots= On March 3, 2007, Thomas signed a 5-year contract with the New England Patriots worth $35 million, including $20 million in guaranteed money. After the move, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick told Thomas that he had \\"backed up the Brink's truck\\" to pay him. Thomas played mainly at inside linebacker in the Patriots' 3-4 defense in 2007, rotating with veterans Tedy Bruschi and Junior Seau. As the Patriots progressed through an undefeated 2007 regular season, Thomas handed out \\"humble pie\\" T-shirts to his teammates in the locker room, echoing's Belichick's message of staying humble after each win. After a season-ending injury to outside linebacker Rosevelt Colvin in late November, Thomas started the remainder of the season and eventually Super Bowl XLII at outside linebacker. In that game, Thomas had a postseason-high two sacks and a forced fumble. Thomas continued to start at outside linebacker for the Patriots in 2008. He led the team with five sacks until suffering a season-ending arm injury in Week 10 against the Buffalo Bills. He was placed on injured reserve on December 5. In 2009, Thomas began the season on the active list; however, he was deactivated for the October 18 game against the Tennessee Titans. Recording one sack on the season to that point, Thomas was asked by the press if he used the decision by Belichick as motivation to perform better. He responded \\"I don't need something like this to fire me up. This isn't kindergarten. I don't play [those] games.\\" Thomas was one of four Patriots sent home as a result of being late for a morning meeting on a snowy Wednesday morning prior to the Patriots' Week 14 matchup against the Carolina Panthers. The next day, Thomas told the press that he called the team saying that he was stuck in traffic but was still sent home upon arriving. He also continued to question the perceived motivational aspect of the decision, saying \\"Motivation is for kindergartners. I'm not a kindergartner.\\" He was again deactivated for the game against the Panthers, but started the Patriots' Week 15 game against the Buffalo Bills. Thomas finished the 2009 season with 11 starts in 14 games played, recording 34 tackles and three sacks. Thomas was released by the Patriots on April 26, 2010, one day after the 2010 NFL Draft.

Since 2004 C4RD has provided a museum space for the exhibition of drawings by established and emerging international and UK artists, illustrators and designers, architects, art therapists, musicians and students in art from various art institutions in Britrain: Royal Academy, Loughborough University, Goldsmiths College, Camberwell College of Arts, London Metropolitan University, Wimbledon School of Art, Royal College of Art and the Prince's Drawing School. It is a non-profit volunteer-run, non-governmental organisation dependent on private donation. The Centre was established to provide a site in London for the display of drawings free from the commercial concerns that pervade the London art scene and to provide a context for drawing that could also exist beyond the demands of the fine arts. Its emphasis is on recent rather than the more commercially regulated 'contemporary'. As a centre it aims to operate as a node of activity between the artist's studio, art college, school, therapeutic or architectural practice and the public, to provide experience in exhibition and curatorship, to add focus to a college programme and to share the experience of drawing.

He was the president of the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen party from December 1946 until the state's annexation to India in 1948. He was also the founder of the extremist Razakar militia in the state. He held the levers of power with the Nizam of Hyderabad, blocking the possibilities of his accommodation with the Dominion of India. According to scholar Lucien Benichou, \\"[Razvi] can arguably be considered to have been the political figure whose influence and unrealistic vision proved the most detrimental to the interests of the State in the crucial years of 1947‚Äì48.\\" Early life and career Kasim Razvi was born in United ProvincesSyed Qasim Husain Rizvi, Geni database, 20 January 2015. and studied law at the Aligarh Muslim University. He migrated to state of Hyderabad after graduation and did a short apprenticeship with Mohammad Ali Fazil in the Hyderabad city. Then he settled down as a lawyer in Latur, Osmanabad district, where he had contacts through his father-in-law, Abdul Hai, who was a former Deputy Superintendent of Police. According to former Hyderabad civil servant Mohammad Hyder, Latur had loose law and order. Razvi amassed a small fortune in shady dealings. After joining the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (Ittehad), Razvi is said to have donated all his property to the party, which made him famous and earned him the title of Siddique-e-Deccan. After the premature death of Nawab Bahadur Yar Jung (the founding leader) in 1944, the Ittehad party fell into fractious extremism. Razvi tried to establish his distinctiveness by advocating political reforms, even though they were not palatable to the Ittehad membership. Then he established his own association in Latur, named Majlis-e- Islah Nazm-o-Nasq, ostensibly to bring about reforms but more likely to establish his own independent following away from the mainstream of the party. In February 1946, the extremists in the party led by Abdur Rahman Rais staged a violent protest over the reconstruction of a mosque, burning down the house of the prime minister Nawab of Chhatari and Sir Wilfrid Grigson, the minister for revenue and police. The incident led to the resignation of the leader of the Ittehad. In the ensuing contest for the new president, Kasim Razvi defeated Rais to emerge as the leader of the Ittehad. His extremism matched that of Rais and the moderates in the party distanced themselves from both the candidates. From this point on, Razvi called the shots in Hyderabad politics. Leadership of Ittehad The Razakars were Muslim separatists who advocated the continuation of Nizam's rule and tried to convince the Nizam to accede to Pakistan . After accession to Pakistan proved impossible owing to the distance of Hyderabad from Pakistan, Razvi encouraged the Nizam to take a hardline stance and ordered the Razakars to resist the accession of Hyderabad to the newly formed Government of India. Razvi even traveled to Delhi and had a stormy meeting with Indian leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. He was one of the founders of Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, a political party intended for the uplift of Muslims. He is quoted to have said \\"Death with the sword in hand, is always preferable to extinction by a mere stroke of the pen\\", prompting the Indian government to call him \\"the Nizam's Frankenstein monster\\". P. V. Kate characterizes him as a religious Muslim fanatic who \\"insisted on the right of Muslims to enslave the Hindu\\".Kate, P. V., Marathwada Under the Nizams, 1724-1948, Delhi: Mittal Publications, 1987, p. 75. He was also implicated in the murder of patriotic progressive Muslims such as Shoebullah Khan who condemned Razvi's Razakars and advocated merger with India.Rao, P.R., History and Culture of Andhra Pradesh: From the Earliest Times to 1991, New Delhi: Sterling Publishers, 2012. p. 284 Razvi launched criminal attacks on the Hindu population, leading to military action by India. After Operation Polo, in which the Indian Army defeated the Razakars and annexed Hyderabad, merging it with India, Razvi was placed under house arrest and tried under Indian laws on seditious activities and inciting communal violence. He was jailed from 1948 to 1957. He was released from prison only on an undertaking that he would migrate to Pakistan within forty-eight hours of his release. He agreed to migrate to Pakistan as a condition of his release from prison, where he died in obscurity in 1970. His family had been residing there since 1949.

The village is known as the de facto capital of ethnic Montenegrins in Serbia, and has a total population of 3,161 people (2011 census). Name In Serbian, the village is known as Lovƒáenac (–õ–æ–≤—õ–µ–Ω–∞—Ü), in German as Sekitsch (in the past rarely Winkelsberg), and in Hungarian as Szeghegy. Its former name in Serbian was Sekiƒá (–°–µ–∫–∏—õ). After the World War II, the village was named Lovƒáenac by the Montenegrin settlers after Mount Lovƒáen in Montenegro. The original Hungarian name of the village was Szeghegy, but Hungarians also used Serbian version of the name in the forms Szikics and Szekics, as well as Germans in the form Sekitsch. One very rare alternative German name was Winkelsberg. History The village first appeared in history in 1476. During the Ottoman administration, the village of Sekiƒá was populated by ethnic Serbs.Dr Du≈°an J. Popoviƒá, Srbi u Vojvodini, knjiga 1, Novi Sad, 1990, page 113. The ethnic Germans settled there in 1786. These German settlers, originally from all over, came to be a distinct group known as Vojvodina Germans (Wojwodinedeutsche), a branch of the Danube Swabians since 1918. At its peak (in 1910), the village had a population of 5,394 people,Slobodan ƒÜurƒçiƒá, Broj stanovnika Vojvodine, Novi Sad, 1996, page 122. mostly Germans. Following the Axis occupation of this part of Yugoslavia (1941-1944) and end of World War II, most of the Germans left the country, together with the defeated German army. Those who remained were interned into prison camps. After camps were disbanded in 1948, most of the remaining Yugoslav Germans emigrated to Germany because of economic reasons in the next decades. After World War II, the village was colonized by settlers from Montenegro and Mt. Vla≈°iƒá, Bosnia. The Montenegrins renamed the village in honor of Mt. Lovƒáen and account for the majority of the population.

It is the only French court consisting in a jury trial.Serge Guinchard, Andr√© Varinard and Thierry Debard, Institutions juridictionnelles (= Judicials institutions), Paris, Dalloz editor, 11th edition, 2011.Serge Guinchard and Jacques Buisson, Criminal procedural law, Paris, Lexisnexis editor, 7th edition, 2011. Justiciable matters Under French law, a crime (f) is only any criminal act punishable by over 10 years of prison, including murder and rape. Previous death penalty application The cour d'assises, uniquely outside military law, could sentence proven convicts for serious crimes, i.e. murder (assassinat) to the death penalty until it was abolished from French law in 1981. Composition Cases are tried by a jury of six jurors and a panel of three active judges, that is, one judge-in-charge (called \\"president\\" of the court) and two associate judges (assesseurs), on first hearing, and a jury of nine jurors and a panel of three active judges on appeal. Lists of eligible jurors are put together at random from the list of registered voters, but both the prosecution and defense have the right to peremptory challenge and can refuse a juror without stating a reason. Special procedures exist for the following categories of crimes and suspects: * Felonies committed by teenagers 16 years or older are tried in a special Juvenile Assize Court (Cour d'Assises des Mineurs) * Felonies such as terrorism or major illicit drug trafficking, which are tried in a special assize court sitting 7 active judges on first hearing and 9 on appeal, without jurors. In such cases a simple majority is needed to convict, instead of two thirds majority in jury trial. Procedure The procedure before the Cour d'assises is oral: defendants and witnesses give their testimonies before the court. Witnesses and their close relatives cannot be put under oath, since doing so could force them into self-incrimination or incrimination of a relative. As in all French criminal trials, the victim is a party with its own attorney besides the public prosecution. If the accused is convicted the court will, without the jury, rule on civil damages. At the end of the trial, the judges and jurors retire. They first decide the question of guilt by answering a series of questions‚Äîe.g., \\"Did X murder Y?\\", \\"Did X premeditate the murder?\\" If a conviction results, they then rule on the appropriate penalty. During this procedure, judges and jurors have equal positions on questions of facts, while judges decide questions of procedure. Judges and jurors have also equal positions on sentencing. Voting is secret, blank and invalid votes are counted in favor of the defendant. Appellate Assize Court Every d√©partement in France has its own Cour d'assises. In the past, their verdicts could not be appealed to the court of appeal, and prior to 2001, could only be appealed to the French Court of Cassation, which would review the case on points of procedure and law alone. When reversed, which was uncommon except for the death penalty, the Court would refer the de novo trial to another Assize court. One argument in favor of this practice was that allowing appeals to be made to professional judges after a verdict had been rendered by a popular jury would in essence deny popular sovereignty. Since 2001, however, Assize court verdicts may be appealed on points of fact (including sentence) to another county's Assize court (chosen by the French Court of Cassation) and heard before a larger jury. The case is then fully retried. Appeals to the Court of Cassation are still possible on points of law and procedure after the first appeal (except in case of acquittal). If this appeal on law is denied, the verdict is final; otherwise, the Cour of Cassation will quash (casse) the verdict and remand the case to the appeal court for a retrial of points of fact and law.

Plot The story of the game takes place between Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and Prince of Persia: Warrior Within. The game is set in Persia, India, and the fictional Aresura. Each of these places sends three generals to fight their wars. The Prince finds out that he is being hunted by the Dahaka, an incarnation of fate, because he interfered with time and cheated his own death in the process. However, the Prince accidentally starts a conflict between Persia and India. Over the span of the game, the Prince fights the Deavas, a mythical race of demons contained in a box he opens, and Kalim, the Prince of India and brother of his long lost love Farah. Because of the wars the Prince becomes darker and matures. The game gives information as to what happens in between the two games in the Sands of Time trilogy. Gameplay Battles of Prince Of Persia is a turn-based tactics game combined with collectible card game elements. The game involves a variety of playing cards which are characterized by a picture and a number, providing the card with its two uses. The first use is to play the magical effect on the card, the second use is to play the number on the card, which determines how many orders the player may give within the hour. Each battle is divided up into hours, which are then divided into turns. Each turn, a player either uses a card for effect or orders, or passes. An hour ends when both players are unable or unwilling to use any more cards and both pass. The game includes tactical elements such as zone of control and directional facing, where attacking an enemy from behind will produce better results than from the front. Zone Of Control prevents players from moving their units right through an enemy's lines and directly to the goal or leader. Reception Battles of Prince of Persia received mixed reviews; GameRankings gave it a score of 65.16%, while Metacritic gave it 64 out of 100.

He participated in a club record three promotions. His customary position was in defence, but he was also a versatile player who occupied several different positions for Albion. He was also known as a set piece specialist, having scored several goals from free-kicks and penalties. Later in his career, Clement was affected by knee injuries and was forced to retire in January 2010. Football career =Early career= The son of Dave Clement, the former QPR and England full-back of the 1970s, Neil Clement was born in Reading, Berkshire but later attended Dorridge Junior School and Arden School in the West Midlands. His brother is football coach Paul Clement. As a teenager, Clement obtained a place at The Football Association's School of Excellence at Lilleshall. He had played as a centre-forward up until the age of 14, and only switched to left-back to improve his chances of getting into Lilleshall. He started his career at Chelsea, making his professional d√©but in a 3‚Äì1 Premier League win over West Ham on 21 December 1996. This was to be his only league appearance and only start for Chelsea. He failed to make a single appearance during 1997‚Äì98, and the following season his contribution to Chelsea was restricted to just two substitute appearances in the League Cup. To gain first team experience, Clement was loaned out to Reading in November 1998, making his d√©but in a 1‚Äì0 win at Northampton on 21 November 1998. A week later, on 28 November, he scored his first goal in professional football as Reading beat Lincoln 2‚Äì1. He remained with Reading until February 1999, but the following month started another loan spell, this time at Preston North End. He was sent off on his North End d√©but in a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Colchester on 2 April 1999. In 1999‚Äì2000, Clement continued to struggle in his attempt to break into the Chelsea first team. In November 1999 he was loaned out to Brentford, making his d√©but in a 4‚Äì1 defeat to Bournemouth on 23 November. He returned to Chelsea in January 2000, making one further substitute appearance as the Blues beat Gillingham 5‚Äì0 in an FA Cup quarter-final in February. =West Bromwich Albion= On transfer deadline day in March 2000, Clement joined West Bromwich Albion on loan for the rest of the season, making his Albion d√©but in a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Manchester City at Maine Road on 25 March. His performances in Albion's successful attempt to avoid relegation from Division One earned him a permanent transfer in July, in a move costing ¬£150,000. Clement scored his first goal for his new club in a 2‚Äì1 first leg win in the League Cup away at Derby County on 19 September 2000. He also scored in the second leg a week later, but Albion lost the tie 5‚Äì4 on aggregate. His first league goal for the Baggies came in a 3‚Äì2 Hawthorns defeat to Norwich City on 14 October 2000. In all, Clement appeared 52 times for Albion in 2000‚Äì01, missing just one game in all competitions and winning the club's Player of the Season award. Albion reached the promotion play-offs, losing in the semi-final to Bolton Wanderers. Clement was again a key player for Albion during 2001‚Äì02. As well as converting penalties in Albion's FA Cup victories against Premiership sides Sunderland and Leicester, he missed only one league game as Albion won promotion to the top flight. His efforts were recognised when he was named in the PFA Division One team of the year. Clement featured heavily once more in 2002‚Äì03, missing only two games all season, and although Albion were relegated, he played his part in a second promotion in 2003‚Äì04. He scored in successive games at the start of the 2004‚Äì05 Premiership season, netting against both Blackburn and Aston Villa. In January 2005 Clement signed a new five-and-a-half-year contract, which would keep him at The Hawthorns until 2010. His teammate Darren Moore credited him with playing a key role in Albion's revival during that season, as the team successfully avoided relegation, and Clement also won the West Bromwich Albion Disabled Supporters Club Player of the Year award. Clement's goal in a 4‚Äì0 win against Everton on 19 November 2005 gave him the distinction of being the only Albion player to score in each of the club's first three Premiership seasons, although Albion's 2005‚Äì06 campaign ended in relegation. In 2006‚Äì07 he played in less than half of West Brom's fixtures and was sent off twice. He came on as an 81st-minute substitute in that season's Championship play-off final at Wembley Stadium, as Albion lost 1‚Äì0 to Derby County. At the end of February 2008, Clement joined Hull City on loan, and made his debut for the Tigers in a 2‚Äì1 defeat away at Bristol City. The loan was scheduled to last for the remainder of the season, but Albion exercised an option to recall him to the Hawthorns after 28 days to help their push for promotion. Clement returned to the Albion first team, playing in the final nine games of the season and making his 300th appearance for the club against Queens Park Rangers on the final day of the season. Albion won the match 2‚Äì0 and were promoted as champions; Clement thus became the first player to win three promotions with Albion.Promotion was not actually mathematically certain at the time the article was written, but was highly probable due to Albion's superior goal difference. The team secured promotion beyond all doubt six days later after winning 2‚Äì0 at QPR. Clement was ruled out for the entire 2008‚Äì09 season following a new knee injury sustained in Albion's final pre-season match, against Real Mallorca. The injury forced him to announce his retirement from playing football in January 2010. Horse racing ban In December 2012 Clement, a racehorse owner, and five other men were charged with serious breaches of the rules of racing by the British Horseracing Authority. The charges related to using inside information to place bets, breaching the rules by backing against his own horse Hindu Kush, and failing to provide requested details to the BHA. On 22 May 2013, Clement was found guilty of conspiring to commit a corrupt or fraudulent practice, placing a lay bet on a horse which he then owned and failure to provide phone records to the inquiry. He received a BHA ban of fifteen years. Personal life Clement is married to Rebecca and they have two children together, Olivia Clement and Ruby Clement. His stepfather is football coach and former goalkeeper, Mike Kelly.

The institution has been offering education to students across India through its various programs in the field of higher education. The institution was founded by N. J. Yasaswy, Besant C. Raj and Dr. Prasanna Chandra, the Director of Centre for Financial Management. The institute has a national presence with the sponsoring and establishment of eleven universities across India. Ten of these eleven universities have been established in the states of Uttarakhand, Tripura, Jharkhand, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim (ICFAI Sikkim provides Master of Business Administration through correspondence mode as well), West Bengal, Meghalaya, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh through acts passed by the legislative assemblies of the respective states. The eleventh university, namely the ICFAI Foundation for Higher Education (IFHE), has been declared as a deemed-to-be University under Section 3 of the UGC Act, 1956. A few more university applications are at an advanced stage of processing by the respective state governments. Pedagogy The case study method is a key component of the academic program at IBS, which is one of the few institutions in India that has made case studies a critical component of its curriculum. Almost all the courses at IBS are taught 100% through case studies - the case studies being tailor-made to the requirements of different subject areas and topics. Student evaluation is based on class participation and written reports. Students are encouraged to analyse the issues in-depth by gathering supporting information - either through published sources or by directly interacting with the companies involved.IBS Hyderabad gives special emphasis on the case based pedagogy and teachers pitch in as facilitators of class-room discussion. Indian CFA The Indian CFA is a Charter awarded to candidates completing the Master in Investment and Financial Analysis at the university; the program is focused on financial analysis as applicable to investment management. See next section.  Trademark disputes CFAI vs ICFAI  =History of the dispute= The Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) program was first delivered through AIMR (today's CFA Institute) in the USA, and later in India with the partnership of the then Institute of Certified Financial Analysts of India (ICFAI). Note that ICFAI is not affiliated with the CFA Institute and both the institutes have broken their partnership and are running their courses separately. There was a long pending trademark dispute between CFA Institute, USA & ICFAI over the use of the CFA Designation. On 25 May 2012, both the parties decided to resolve this long pending dispute and have entered into an agreement under which ICFAI will stop providing the CFA Charter. This will allow both the parties to mutually co-exist and pursue their business objectives. ICFAI would continue to operate under the ICFAI brand but will begin phasing out the CFA designation over the next few years. The Candidates who have already been awarded the CFA Charter have been requested by ICFAI to use \\"CFA (ICFAI)\\" to help distinguish themselves from the CFA Institute Charter holders. =ICFAI vs ICAI = In August 1989, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), the national statutory body for professional accounting, imposed restrictions on its members on the use of the designation of \`CFA' awarded by the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts of India (ICFAI). The ICAI notification issued on August 3, 1989 says that \\"if any member of ICAI, i.e. any Chartered Accountant, who obtained the qualification of Chartered Financial Analyst [awarded by ICFAI] on or after January 1, 1990, or has obtained the said qualification earlier did not surrender the same before the said date, [he/she] would be held guilty of professional misconduct under the provisions of the Chartered Accountants (CA) Act.\\" The ICFAI and others filed petitions in the Andhra Pradesh High Court challenging the notification. A single judge and a Division Bench dismissed them. ICFAI appealed the notification, contending that it was violative of a person's fundamental right to practise any profession guaranteed under Article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution. On May 16, 2007 the above notification was quashed by Supreme Court of India, and the ICAI was barred from applying the aforementioned prohibitions on its members. = Future of ICFAI and CFA = ICFAI, having been embroiled in a long legal battle with the CFA Institute, focused its energy on developing private universities, some of which have AICTE recognition along with UGC recognition. ICFAI has focussed all its energies away from developing its CFA charter like giving it statutory recognition increasing its status as a high status profession like that of CA from ICAI, which was announced by the governing member NJ Yeshasway who vowed to take up the CFA Charter a notch above the legendary CA exam considered to be the toughest in the realm of finance, but instead has opened a host of non-CFA programs like MBA, ICFAI Business Schools (IBS), PG Programs which have scaled up into national top 10 place in India. It has also opened schools for under graduate programs and offering degrees. Indian CFAs pass with a stringent eligibility to qualify as CFAs but have only a niche finance sector as the job market unlike CA which has traditional roles of Auditing and taxation along with statutory roles. CFAs work in investment related and finance fields where MBAs (some from ICFAI itself), CAs, Master's degree holders of Statistics, Economics, Doctorates etc. hold top posts. ICFAI though has safeguarded its CFA charter in India with valid state legislature under IUT Tripura Act, but CFA charterholders are not mandatorily employable and currently don't perform any statutory duty unlike CAs, CSs, CWAs, though CCFA tried to accomplish this in investment related areas in India by submitting a draft bill to the ministry of finance for consideration which was rejected due to various legal disputes that ICFAI faces. Also here is a fact to note that ICFAI University Tripura has never been permitted to conduct any distance learning/correspondence course by UGC. CFAs are employed only because of their course contents and rigor of the CFA program, which is the only reason they have got market acceptance with very few qualifying as CFAs every year. ICFAI has very few CFA charter holders, compared to other professionals and hence they don't have a large and established presence in the Indian job market. Indian companies have tied up with other Indian bodies like AMFI or NSE in offering investment designations and courses.As per information on ICFAI Tripura website this has DEC Approval and Recognition of Directorate of Distance Education, The Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts of India University, Tripura, by the Distance Education Council \\"Distance Education Council (DEC) Vide their letter No.DEC/Recog/2010/277 dated August 04,2010 has accorded recognition to the Directorate of Distance Education, The Icfai University, Tripura and its programs after inspection by an expert joint committee consisting of UGC, AICTE and DEC nominees. \\" Frequent changes to eligibility requirements changes in fee structure, exorbitant council membership charges etc., have caused confusion among the student community. Many founding members have left ICFAI as they were not happy with the way ICFAI treated its flagship course. The course, which was once a stepping stone for Indians into analytic finance has become just one more obscure degree due to continuous changes in the curriculum. As a result, there is negativity about this course in the Indian corporate world. Keeping in view the demands from the corporate world and impending competition, ICFAI is thinking of bringing wholesale changes in the curriculum and the training method from the current academic year. The new course can only be completed in 24 months and will include a training program for the passing students of final exam. ICFAI is also creating a window for students of CFA program to undergo 2 months internship with its in-house concerns to impart rigorous analytical skills. Exemption for MBAs will be stopped from the current academic year. Also, ICFAI is drafting a continuing professional development module which will be compulsory for all the current CFAs. This program will enable the current CFAs to enhance their knowledge in their respective areas and will include relevant statutes changes, paradigm shift in capital markets and allied subject matter. ICFAI hopes to regain the old status of its CFA program through continuously evolving methods, the most recent is focussing on the core aspects of investment management and financial analysis in its MFA degree(current CFA syllabus) and increasing CFA charter membership by giving official charters to students who have cleared the core subjects of investment management and financial analysis of the previous(CFA curriculum) MS Finance program.

After WWII, his native dialect was reclassified as part of the newly codified Macedonian language,The Macedonian partisans established a commission to create an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù Macedonian literary language (1945), which became the Macedonian Slavs' legal ‚Äúfirst‚Äù language (with Serbo-Croatian a recognized ‚Äúsecond‚Äù and Bulgarian officially proscribed). D. Hupchick, The Balkans: From Constantinople to Communism, Springer, 2002, , p. 430.\\"The obviously plagiarized historical argument of the Macedonian nationalists for a separate Macedonian ethnicity could be supported only by linguistic reality, and that worked against them until the 1940s. Until a modern Macedonian literary language was mandated by the communist-led partisan movement from Macedonia in 1944, most outside observers and linguists agreed with the Bulgarians in considering the vernacular spoken by the Macedonian Slavs as a western dialect of Bulgarian\\". Dennis P. Hupchick, Conflict and Chaos in Eastern Europe, Palgrave Macmillan, 1995, , p. 143.In one respect, however, Macedonian nationalism threw up a problem which the Communist Party could not ignore: the question of the status of the Macedonian language. If, as Dr Johnson remarked, languages are the pedigrees of nations, then the Slav inhabitants of Macedonia were by any reasonable linguistic criteria part of the Bulgarian nation... The construction and dissemination of a distinctive Macedonian language was the medium through which a sense of Macedonian identity was to be fixed... The past was systematically falsified to conceal the fact that many prominent ‚ÄòMacedonians‚Äô had supposed themselves to be Bulgarians, and generations of students were taught the pseudo-history of the Macedonian nation. The mass media and education were the key to this process of national acculturation, speaking to people in a language that they came to regard as their Macedonian mother tongue, even if it was perfectly understood in Sofia. For more see: Michael L. Benson, Yugoslavia: A Concise History, Edition 2, Springer, 2003, , p. 89. and according to the subsequently developed Macedonian historiography, he was an ethnic Macedonian writer and poet.Because in many documents of 19th and early 20th century period, the local Slavic population is not referred to as \\"Macedonian\\" but as \\"Bulgarian\\", Macedonian historians argue that it was Macedonian, regardless of what is written in the records. For more see: Ulf Brunnbauer, ‚ÄúServing the Nation: Historiography in the Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) after Socialism‚Äú, Historien, Vol. 4 (2003-4), pp. 161-182.Numerous prominent activists with pro- Bulgarian sentiments from the 19th and early 20th centuries are described in Macedonian textbooks as ethnic Macedonians. Macedonian researchers claim that \\"Bulgarian\\" at that time was a term, not related to any ethnicity, but was used as a synonym for \\"Slavic\\", \\"Christian\\" or \\"peasant\\". Chris Kostov, Contested Ethnic Identity: The Case of Macedonian Immigrants in Toronto, 1900-1996, Peter Lang, 2010, , p. 92.Yugoslav Communists recognized the existence of a Macedonian nationality during WWII to quiet fears of the Macedonian population that a communist Yugoslavia would continue to follow the former Yugoslav policy of forced Serbianization. Hence, for them to recognize the inhabitants of Macedonia as Bulgarians would be tantamount to admitting that they should be part of the Bulgarian state. For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs and to create a separate national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.

Biography  He was a writer and collector of folk literary works. His family moved to Prilep from village of Oreovec. His father, Kosta, lived in Kru≈°evo for a period of time, before Marko Cepenkov was born. Since his father was a traveler, Cepenkov earned the opportunity to travel. He lived in Ohrid and Struga and visited other places in the country by the time he was fourteen. Cepenkov was educated in small Greek schools. In 1844 he moved to Prilep, where he attended the private school of Hadji pop Konstantin Dimkov and father Aleksa, for two years. He also became a tailor and while working in the shop he met a lot of people who would tell him folk stories. Cepenkov was also a good narrator and knew a lot of folk stories. Since then he became a collector of folk stories and other folk works. In 1857 Cepenkov was a teacher in Prilep. After he met Dimitar Miladinov he started collecting more and more folk works: songs, stories, riddles, and others. In that time he knew more than 150 stories and wrote one to two stories per week, as he mentions in his Autobiography. Marko Tsepenkov contacted with other figures of the Bulgarian National Revival period who noted down folklore, such as Kuzman Shapkarev and Metodi Kusev. He was influenced by the works of Georgi Rakovski, Vasil Cholakov, Ivan Blaskov and Dimitar Matov.The ethnographic interests of Marko Tsepenkov, Bulgarian Ethnology (4/1980), Genchev, Stojan; Issue: 4/1980, Page Range: 49-56.

Here he was encouraged by Prof. Ivan Shishmanov, who includes his recordings in several volumes of the ‚ÄúCollection of works of the popular spirit‚Äù (SBNU). In this collection, published until in 1900, Cepenkov publishes many tales and legends, songs, a great number of beliefs and curses, interpretations of dreams, magic formulas, habits and rites, proverbs, riddles and folklore for children. Between 1896 and 1911, he published about 10 of his poems and his play \\"Cane Voivoda,\\" which confirmed his own creative and literary pledge. He also wrote about a dozen songs with patriotic themes, and his \\"Autobiography\\". Cepenkov was in close relations with his countryman, then Metropolitan of Stara Zagora, Metodi Kusev. The \\"Institute of Folklore\\" of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences works today with the complete edition in six volumes of these folk materials. His collected folk works were published in ten books in Skopje in 1972. A selection of his folktales have been published in English, such as 19th Century Macedonian Folktales by the Macquarie University in Sydney in 1991. In his honor, the Macedonian institute for folklore is named after him.

Early life Down was born in Torpoint, Cornwall. His father was originally from Derry in Ireland, and his mother, Hannah Haydon, from North Devon.Stephen Ashwal, The Founders of Child Neurology, p. 222 His father was descended from an Irish family, his great-great grandfather having been the Protestant Bishop of Derry and Raphoe. John Down went to local schools including the Devonport Classical and Mathematical School. At 14 he was apprenticed to his father, the village apothecary at Anthony St Jacob's. The vicar gave him a present of Arnott's Physics which made him determined to take up a scientific career. In 1846, a chance encounter with a strange looking girl sparked Down's interest in becoming a doctor. At the age of 18, he went to London where he got a post working for a surgeon in the Whitechapel Road where he had to bleed patients, extract teeth, wash bottles and dispense drugs. Later he entered the pharmaceutical laboratory in Bloomsbury Square and won the prize for organic chemistry. He also met Michael Faraday and helped him with his work on gases. More than once he was called back to Torpoint to help his father in the business until the latter died in 1853. Career Down entered the Royal London Hospital as a student in 1853. One of his teachers was William John Little (of Little's disease). There he had a career distinguished by honours and gold medals and he qualified in 1856 at the Apothecaries Hall and the Royal College of Surgeons. In order to save money while in medical school, he stayed with his sister and her husband. While living with his sister he met his sister-in-law, Mary Crellin who he later married in 1860. In 1858, he was appointed Medical Superintendent of the Earlswood Asylum in Surrey where worked for 10 years. Later career Down decided to transform Earlswood, a large institution which had its origins in two pioneering institutions set up in Highgate and Colchester, while he took his MB in London, won the Gold Medal in physiology and took his MRCP and MD degrees. He was elected Assistant Physician to the London Hospital and continued to live at Earlswood and practice there and in London. He and his wife Mary transformed Earlswood from a place of horror where patients were subject to corporal punishment and kept in dirty conditions and unschooled, to a happy place where all punishment was forbidden and replaced with kindness and rewards, the patients' dignity was valued and they were taught horse riding, gardening, crafts and elocution. Down restructured the administration of the Asylum and started a regimen of stimulation, good food, and occupational training. In 1866, he wrote a paper entitled \\"Observations on an Ethnic Classification of Idiots\\" in which he put forward the theory that it was possible to classify different types of conditions by ethnic characteristics. He listed several types including the Malay, Caucasian and Ethiopian types. In the main the paper is about what is known as Down syndrome, named after him, but which he classified as the Mongolian type of idiot. As a result, Down syndrome was also known as \\"Mongolism\\" and people with Down syndrome referred to as \\"Mongoloids\\". Down's paper also argued that if mere disease is able to break down racial barriers to the point of causing the facial features of the offspring of whites to resemble those of another race, then racial differences must be the result of variation, affirming therefore the unity of the human species. Down used this reasoning to argue against a tendency he perceived in his day to regard different races as separate species. Down was an advocate for higher education for women and disagreed with the notion that it would make the women liable to produce ‚Äúfeeble-minded‚Äù children. He also believed women should be allowed to join the workforce. This belief led him to petition the lords of Earlswood to pay his wife Mary for her contributions to the running of Earlswood. This request was refused because at the time the contributions of women in the workforce were considered volunteer work. This situation was thought to put a strain on Down's relationship with the lords of Earlswood. Down eventually retired from Earlswood in 1868 after the lords refused to give him the money he needed to display the artwork of some of his patients at an exhibition. After resigning from Earlswood, Down set up his own private home for the those with developmental and intellectual disabilities at Normansfield, between Hampton Wick and Teddington. The homes first occupants were 18 mentally disabled children of upper class members of the community such as lords and physicians. In the home, Down and his wife did their best to educate the children and exposed them to a wide variety of mentally stimulating activities. Normansfield was a success and eventually had to be expanded to house the growing number of its inhabitants. By 1876 the number of inhabitants in Normansfield had grown to 160. Down also made contributions to medicine through his research and was the first person to publish a description of the Prader-Willi syndrome, which he called 'polysarcia'. In 1887, he wrote a book entitled \\"Mental Affections of Childhood and Youth\\". It was published at the request of the Medical Society of London and was a transcript of three lectures along with fifteen papers Down published on mental defects. The book details his ideas and findings about several mental abnormalities such as Down syndrome and microcephaly. It also contains his view on the leading thoughts and available literature on the subject. In the lectures and some of the papers, he also weighed in on what he believed were the potential causes of various mental disorders. A reoccurring theme was the influence of parental physical and mental health on their child's chances of being born with a mental disorder. He also explored how the obstetric practices of the time could have influenced postnatal health. Down was a respected member of his community and was an elected member of the Middlesex County Council. Down died in the autumn of 1896 at the age of 67. His body was cremated and kept in Normansfield. After his death, people stood on the streets with respect as his funeral procession passed by. After his wife died, she was also cremated and their ashes were scattered together. His sons, Reginald and Percival, both qualified in medicine at the London Hospital, joined their father, and became responsible for the hospital after his death in 1896. His grandson, Reginald's son, was born in 1905 with Down Syndrome. Down's institution was later absorbed into the National Health Service in 1952. A century after Down's death, his contributions to the field of medicine were celebrated at the Mansell Symposium in the Medical Society of London, and the Royal Society of Medicine published a biography about him. The building at Normansfield is grade II* listed and is now known as the Langdon Down Centre. It accommodates the headquarters of the Down's Syndrome Association. The newest part of his hometown, Torpoint, had a street named in his honour: Langdon Down Way.

Patchouli oil is an important material in perfumery. The (‚àí)-optical isomer is one of the organic compounds responsible for the typical patchouli scent. Patchoulol is also used in the synthesis of the chemotherapy drug Taxol. Structure determination Patchouli alcohol was first isolated in 1869 by Gal and its chemical composition later correctly formulated as C15H26O by Montgolfier. During early structural investigation the presence of a saturated tricyclic tertiary alcohol was established. After several years of careful study B√ºchi and co-workers proposed the structure of patchouli alcohol to correspond to 1, based on degradation studies from his earlier work, verified later by synthesis of material which corresponded to the natural authentic sample of patchouli alcohol. Proposed sequence for the synthesis of patchouli alcohol. A serendipitous finding by Dunitz and co-workers revealed a contradictory structure. They had undertaken an X-ray analysis of the patchouli alcohol diester of chromic acid, with the objective of determining the Cr-O-C angles. In the course of their analysis they found that the X-ray evidence could not be reconciled with the proposed structure 1. Instead they proposed together with B√ºchi the novel structure 2. The discrepancy had resulted from an unanticipated skeletal rearrangement that had occurred in the B√ºchi synthesis when patchoulene was treated with peroxy acid, an operation that by accident generated the correct architecture of the natural product.

The underlying cause is not fully understood but it may be a result of vasovagal response, postural hypotension, or a combination thereof. People often become pale, lightheaded, nauseated, sweaty and weak before they lose consciousness. Sometimes defecating, coughing, or severe vomiting may cause fainting in a similar way. Causes When one strains to increase the flow of urine, it stimulates the vagus nerve (usually more pronounced in elderly men with large prostates). The vagus nerve stimulus causes slowing down of the heart (bradycardia) and a drop in blood pressure. The heart cannot perform effectively as a pump because insufficient blood comes to it. It can be associated with a very rare tumor known as a paraprostatic pheochromocytoma within the urinary bladder. Treatment There is no specific treatment for micturition syncope. General advice to men with micturition syncope includes: *to sit while urinating *to sit on the edge of the bed for a while before getting up and going to the toilet *to avoid urinating while sleepy *to urinate before sleep *to stop urination, cross the legs, and flex them immediately upon feeling faintness Epidemiology Responsible for 2.4 to 8.4 percent of all cases of fainting in adults, it most commonly occurs in males.

When NGP is in operation it is normal for the reaction rate to be increased. It is also possible for the stereochemistry of the reaction to be abnormal (or unexpected) when compared with a normal reaction. While it is possible for neighbouring groups to influence many reactions in organic chemistry (e.g. the reaction of a diene such as 1,3-cyclohexadiene with maleic anhydride normally gives the endo isomer because of a secondary effect {overlap of the carbonyl group œÄ orbitals with the transition state in the Diels-Alder reaction}) this page is limited to neighbouring group effects seen with carbocations and SN2 reactions. NGP by heteroatom lone pairs  A classic example of NGP is the reaction of a sulfur or nitrogen mustard with a nucleophile, the rate of reaction is much higher for the sulfur mustard and a nucleophile than it would be for a primary alkyl chloride without a heteroatom. 400px Ph-S-CH2-CH2-Cl reacts with water 600 times faster than CH3-CH2-CH2-Cl NGP by an alkene  The œÄ orbitals of an alkene can stabilize a transition state by helping to delocalize the positive charge of the carbocation. For instance the unsaturated tosylate will react more quickly (1011 times faster for aqueous solvolysis) with a nucleophile than the saturated tosylate. 250px The carbocationic intermediate will be stabilized by resonance where the positive charge is spread over several atoms. In the diagram below this is shown. 600px Here is a different view of the same intermediates. 400px Even if the alkene is more remote from the reacting center the alkene can still act in this way. For instance in the following alkyl benzenesulfonate the alkene is able to delocalise the carbocation. 650px Also the increase in the rate of the SN2 reaction of allyl bromide with a nucleophile compared with the reaction of n-propyl bromide is because the orbitals of the œÄ bond overlap with those of the transition state. In the allyl system the alkene orbitals overlap with the orbitals of a SN2 transition state. 100px NGP by a cyclopropane, cyclobutane or a homoallyl group  If Cyclopropylmethyl chloride is reacted with ethanol and water then a mixture of 48% cyclopropylmethyl alcohol, 47% cyclobutanol and 5% homoallyl alcohol (but-3-enol) is obtained. This is because the carbocationic intermediate is delocalised onto many different carbons through a reversible ring opening. 500px NGP by an aromatic ring  In the case of a benzyl halide the reactivity is higher because the SN2 transition state enjoys a similar overlap effect to that in the allyl system. 100px An aromatic ring can assist in the formation of a carbocationic intermediate called a phenonium ion by delocalising the positive charge. 650px When the following tosylate reacts with acetic acid in solvolysis then rather than a simple SN2 reaction forming B, a 48:48:4 mixture of A, B (which are enantiomers) and C+D was obtained . 600px The mechanism which forms A and B is shown below. 600px NGP by aliphatic C-C or C-H bonds  Aliphatic C-C or C-H bonds can lead to charge delocalization if these bonds are close and antiperiplanar to the leaving group. Corresponding intermediates are referred to a nonclassical ions, with the 2-norbornyl system as the most well known case.

She is said to haunt the countryside of Leicestershire, living in a cave in the Dane Hills with a great oak tree at the entrance.Alexander, Marc (2002). A Companion to the Folklore, Myths & Customs of Britain. BCA. p. 23. She is said to venture out at night looking for unsuspecting children and lambs to eat, then tanning their skins by hanging them on a tree before wearing them around her waist.Billson, Charles James (1895). \\"Leicestershire and Rutland\\" in County Folk-Lore (Vol. 1). The Folklore Society. pp. 4‚Äì9. She would reach inside houses to snatch people. Legend has it that she used her iron claws to dig her cave out of the side of a sandstone cliff, making herself a home there which is known as Black Annis' Bower Close. The legend led to parents warning their children that Black Annis would get them if they did not behave. She was also known to hide in the branches of her oak tree waiting to leap upon unsuspecting prey.Billson (1895). p. 8. Other traditions stated that when she ground her teeth people could hear her, giving them time to bolt their doors and keep away from the window. It is said that cottages in Leicestershire were purposely built with small windows so that Black Annis could only get a single arm inside. When she howled she could be heard five miles away, then the cottagers would fasten skins across the window and place protective herbs above it to keep themselves safe. Origins The earliest known written reference to Black Annis was from an eighteenth century title deed that referred to a parcel of land (or \\"close\\") as \\"Black Anny's Bower Close\\". The first volume of County Folklore (1895), published by The Folklore Society, mentions two such title deeds dated May 13th and 14th, 1764.Billson (1895). pp. 8‚Äì9. The Black Annis figure has several possible origins. Some have claimed, as T. C. Lethbridge did, that the origin can be found in Celtic mythology based on Danu (or Anu) or it may derive from Germanic mythology (see Hel).Black Annis ‚Äì leicester legend or Widespread Myths Donald Alexander Mackenzie in his 1917 book Myths of Crete and Pre-Hellenic Europe suggested the origin of the legend may go back to the mother goddess of ancient Europe which he contends was thought of as a devourer of children.Mackenzie, Donald A. (1917). Myths of Crete and Pre- Hellenic Europe. Kessinger. pp. 111‚Äì122. He identified Black Annis as being similar to the Indic Kali, Gaelic Muilearteach and Cailleach Bheare, the Greek Demeter, the Mesopotamian Labartu, and the Egyptian Isis-Hathor and Neith. It has been suggested that the legend may derive from a popular memory of sacrifice to an ancient goddess.Spence, Lewis (1972). The Minor Traditions of British Mythology. Ayer. p. 29. . It is thought that offerings of children may have been made to the goddess that inspired the legend in the archaeological Hunting Period, the oak tree at the cave's entrance also a common site of local meetings. Ronald Hutton however disagrees with such theories in his book The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft. He suggests that the Black Annis of Leicestershire legend was based on a real person named Agnes Scott, a late medieval anchoress (or by some accounts a Dominican nun who cared for a local leper colony), born in Little Antrum, who lived a life of prayer in a cave in the Dane Hills and was buried in the churchyard in Swithland.Hutton, Ronald (2001). The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft. Oxford University Press. pp. 274‚Äì275. .BBC ‚Äì h2g2 ‚Äì Black Annis ‚Äì Legend of Leicester Hutton suggests that the memory of Scott was distorted into the image of Black Annis either to frighten local children or due to the anti-anchorite sentiment that arose from the Protestant Reformation. In the Victorian era the story of Agnes Scott, or Annis, became confused with the similarly named goddess Anu. Lethbridge made this connection and went on to claim that Annis was the personification of the Great Goddess in crone form, leading to interest from Wiccan groups. The connection between Black Annis and Agnes Scott was made previous to Hutton, including the gravesite and cave, in an issue of the Leicester Chronicle dated Feb. 26th, 1842 and reprinted in the first volume of County Folklore (1895).Billson (1895). p. 6. Many of the modern conceptions of Black Annis were popularized in a poem by John Heyrick, given in full in County Folklore but excerpted here: Customs and traces Black Annis was also represented in monstrous cat form, and the legend led to a local ritual in early spring when a dead cat would be dragged before a pack of hounds in front of her bower to celebrate the end of winter.Turner, Patricia & Coulter, Charles Russell (2001). Dictionary of Ancient Deities. Oxford University Press. p. 102. . According to Katharine Briggs this drag hunt was held on Easter Monday (also known as Black Monday) and led from Annis' Bower to the mayor of Leicester's house. The bait dragged was a dead cat drenched in aniseed. This custom died out at the end of the 18th century.Billson (1895). pp. 76‚Äì77. Another tradition stated that Black Annis (in the form of Cat Anna) lived in the cellars beneath Leicester Castle and that there was an underground passage extending from the cellars to the Dane Hills along which she ran.Billson (1895). p. 9. In 1837 a play called Black Anna's Bower, or the Maniac of the Dane Hills was performed at the Leicester Theatre. The plot involved the murder of a landlady of the Blue Boar Inn, in which Black Anna played a part similar to that of the witches in Macbeth.

He grew up in Los Angeles, California, where he graduated from Manual Arts High School and received a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial management at the University of Southern California in 1937. During his military career he also graduated from the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas and the Armed Forces Staff College in Norfolk, Virginia. After a year serving as the first field secretary for his college fraternity, Phi Kappa Tau, he began his military career in June 1938 as an aviation cadet in the Army Air Corps. He received his pilot wings and commission at Kelly Field, Texas, in 1939. His first years of service were as flying instructor, flight commander, cadet commandant, flying director and operations officer at Randolph Field, Texas. During World War II, General Page served in the South Pacific area with the XIII Fighter Command as operations officer and was awarded the Legion of Merit. He flew 32 combat missions in P-38 Lightning and P-39 Airacobra fighter aircraft. He returned to the United States in January 1946 and assumed duties as deputy base commander of Hamilton Field, California. In February 1948 he entered the Armed Forces Staff College, Norfolk, Virginia. He was assigned in July 1948 as Air Force liaison officer in the newly created Office of the Secretary of Defense. In April 1949 he was appointed executive to the deputy chief of staff for operations, Headquarters U.S. Air Force, Washington, D.C. In September 1950 General Page went to London, England, as Air Force representative to the Northern European Regional Planning Group. In July 1951 he became deputy chief of staff for plans for Allied Air Forces Northern Europe with headquarters in Oslo, Norway. After two years, he returned to the United States to serve as chief of the Doctrine Division of the Evaluation Staff at the Air War College, Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, from August 1953 to August 1955. In August 1955 he entered the National War College and in September 1956 assumed command of the 3525th Combat Crew Training Wing (Fighter), at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona. He returned to Headquarters U.S. Air Force in June 1960 as deputy director for war plans for the deputy chief of staff for plans and programs, and in September 1961 he became deputy director for aerospace plans for the deputy chief of staff for plans and operations. For his service in these two assignments he received the Distinguished Service Medal, the nation's highest peacetime military award. General Page was transferred to Headquarters Air Force Systems Command at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland in 1964 where he earned a second Legion of Merit as deputy chief of staff for plans. In August 1966 he assumed the dual position of vice commander of the Air University and commandant of the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. Controversy Page was alleged to have revealed confidential bomb shortages in Vietnam and to have criticized defense policies of Defense Secretary Robert McNamara during an Air War College seminar for senior Air Force Reserve officers in December 1966. Even though the seminar's discussions were understood to be classified Secret and to be strictly confined behind closed doors, Page was relieved of his command and transferred to the air division command at Okinawa \\"without prejudice.\\" Arizona senator Barry Goldwater accused one of the seminar attendees, a Reserve colonel and politician recently defeated in his reelection bid for the governorship of Arizona, of having made complaints to the Department of Defense that led to General Page's relief and subsequent transfer. Page's relief raised concerns not only with the Air War College faculty but through the faculties of the nation's other senior service colleges (SSC) as well, as it struck at one of the basic tenets of SSC education: the free give-and-take of academic discussion behind the closed doors of the college. In March 1967, because of his comments, he was assigned as commander of the 313th Air Division at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa. There he earned the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal. In 1969 General Page assumed his final command - Sheppard Technical Training Center, Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas. He retired August 1, 1972. He was a qualified jet fighter pilot with more than 5,800 hours of flying time. He was also a recipient of the Air Medal and the Army Commendation Medal.

Due to the ongoing conflict between the Copenhagen Municipality and the activists occupying the premises, the building on Jagtvej was the subject of intense media attention and public debate from the mid-1990s till 2008. Police started to clear the Ungdomshuset building early on Thursday, 1 March 2007. Demolition began on 5 March 2007 and was completed two days later. .. Since the eviction in March 2007, former users and supporters held weekly demonstrations for a new Ungdomshuset, the demonstrations initially starting from nearby square 'Bl√•g√•rds Plads' (and later Gammel Torv) every Thursday at 5 p.m. and going to various places in Copenhagen, the starting point being later changed to Gammel Torv in downtown Copenhagen as demonstrators said they were getting closer to the politicians concerning a solution for a new Ungdomshus at an old school. In the summer of 2007, an initiative known as G13 announced that on the 6 October they would stage a massive public attempt to squat an old public waterworks located on Gr√∏ndalsv√¶nge All√© 13 in northwestern Copenhagen to be used as a new Ungdomshuset. The event, which gathered several thousand, was announced as non-violent, but was met with heavy opposition from the police who arrested 436 people and threw large amounts of tear gas.. Recognizing that the event, which had received heavy public attention, had been carried out with peaceful means, on 11 October Ritt Bjerregaard‚Äîthe Lord Mayor of Copenhagen‚Äîinvited spokesmen from Ungdomshuset to have negotiations concerning a peaceful solution to the conflict.. The new Ungdomshuset opened successfully on 1 July 2008 in North-West Copenhagen's Bispebjerg area, after more than 16 months of weekly demonstrations.  History  The building was completed on 12 November 1897, with the name \\"Folkets Hus\\" (The People's House). The house functioned as one of the resorts for the then-incipient labour movement of Copenhagen. Since labour organisations were unpopular in the eyes of the authorities, and reprisals were often carried out against them, the organisations had to build their own headquarters‚ÄîFolkets Hus was the fourth of these to be built. The roots of several demonstrations and meetings were planted in Folkets Hus, and as a result it was strongly linked to the great demonstration against unemployment in 1918 when workers stormed the Copenhagen Stock Exchange (B√∏rsen). In 1910, The Second International held an International Women's conference at the house, during which Clara Zetkin launched the idea of an International Women's Day. Vladimir Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg visited the centre. During the 1950s it was still primarily used by the different sections, associations and unions of the labour movement. All kinds of different activities took place: for example, boxing matches and end- of-season dances. Several years later, Brugsen, a Danish chain of supermarkets, bought Folkets Hus, planning to tear down the building and build a supermarket in its place. However, as this was prohibited due to the historic importance of the place, Brugsen sold the ground to the folk music ensemble Tingluti in 1978. As a consequence of a burst water main which they could not afford to repair, Tingluti had to sell the ground to the municipality of Copenhagen. The price at the time was DKK 700,000. In 1982 Folkets Hus was assigned to a group of young people‚Äîthe original founders of Ungdomshuset‚Äîalthough the municipality of Copenhagen still owned the building. It was at this time that the building was given its current name: Ungdomshuset. Nick Cave, Einst√ºrzende Neubauten and Bj√∂rk played there.\\"Les raisons de la col√®re\\" , Alternatives, 29 March 2007 In January 1996, Ungdomshuset was ravaged by a fire and found to be plagued by fungus and rot. The municipality of Copenhagen decided to close the house, claiming that it would be too expensive to repair the damages and renovate the building. The activists of the house decided to fix the damages themselves and on 1 March of the next year, their work was approved by the fire prevention department. In 1999 the building was put on sale to the highest bidder by the municipality following controversy on the renovation of the building and a refusal from the inhabitants to pay the rent agreed upon in the original contract. This prodded the users of the building to post a large banner on the facade with the message: \\"For sale along with 500 autonome, stone throwing, violent psychopaths from hell.\\". Despite this ominous warning, a company called Human A/S bought the building in December 2000 (although ownership did not actually change hands until 2001), after which Human A/S was sold to the independent Christian sect \\"Faderhuset\\".Faderhuset af Birger Langkjer - Dialogcentret.dk Dialogcentret.dk . However, the squatters refused to leave the house. Until 1 March 2007 the young squatters used the house as if the change of ownership had not happened and the new owners were not allowed inside at any time. Ungdomshuset received more than 500 visitors a week. = Ownership controversy = 1 May 2006 demonstration In August 2003, Faderhuset served a writ upon Ungdomshuset and its users and claimed ownership of the building. In December the same year, the trial began at the Copenhagen County Court. On 7 January 2004 the verdict from City Court arrived, stating that Faderhuset was entitled to sue four activists (rather than Ungdomshuset itself) since Ungdomshuset functions without a hierarchical management and is therefore not regarded as an organisation. The court, however, denied Faderhuset compensation. Both sides appealed against the decision; Faderhuset demanding compensation and Ungdomshuset demanding future right of usage. On 28 August 2006 the National Court stated, as the City Court did, that the right of ownership and usage of Ungdomshuset belonged to Faderhuset and it was free to evict the inhabitants. Originally, this decision ordered the current occupants out by 9:00 a.m. on the morning of 14 December 2006. Ungdomshuset was also denied the right of appeal to the Supreme Court, meaning that they had no further options within the legal system. The police, however, stated that they would not evict the activists until 2007. Indland , JP.dk. The activists refused to leave the house and barricaded themselves inside. In addition, an open-letter stating \\"Troublemakers of the World; We bid you Welcome!\\" had been sent to different autonomous groups around the world, asking for help defending the house in the event of a forced eviction.Letter to troublemakers of the world . Accessed 5 March 2007. On 12 December, Faderhuset refused an offer from the foundation \\"Jagtvej 69\\" to sell the house for DKK 13 million. On 16 December, around 2000 activists, some of them foreigners, demonstrated in Copenhagen in support of Ungdomshuset. The police had not been notified of the demonstration. The vanguard of the demonstration wore masks or helmets, which is not permitted by law during demonstrations in Denmark. The police ordered the demonstration to break up and the demonstrators to disperse. The demonstrators attacked the police; stones and fireworks were thrown at the police and burning barricades set up. The demonstration degenerated into what the police characterised as the worst riots in Denmark in many years‚Äîthey used teargas, which was a very rare occurrence in Denmark.Voldsomme gadekampe p√• N√∏rrebro Both police and demonstrators were injured.

Image:gadekampe5.jpgThe police used a large amount of teargas against the demonstrators By the end of the night 273 people had been arrested. The majority of those arrested were released the following day, 17 December.Ti anholdte l√∏sladt af byretten The total number of demonstrators arrested was amongst the highest for a single event in Denmark since World War II. The fury of the demonstrators was described by the police as the worst since 18 May 1993, when another violent demonstration (this time against Danish EU membership) by the extreme left injured 92 officers and 11 demonstrators. = Clearance = The first helicopter arriving with police officers On 1 March 2007 Ungdomshuset was cleared of its occupants by the police at about 7:00 (CET) in the morning. A 50-metre area surrounding the building was sealed off. The building was taken with assistance from a military helicopter, an airport crash tender and two boom cranes, used as a form of modern-day siege towers. Special forces entered the building from the roof, the windows and the ground, while the house was covered in foam to diminish the effectiveness of possible counterattacks such as Molotov cocktails. Afterwards the supporters of Ungdomshuset announced that it was \\"either an Ungdomshus or a battle for an Ungdomshus ‚Äî the clearing will never be forgiven\\". Rioting broke out, including a blockade of N√∏rrebrogade, the main street of N√∏rrebro, and fires in the areas surrounding Freetown Christiania and south of N√∏rrebrogade. Containers were turned over, windows were broken. Molotov cocktails were thrown out by the demonstrators, at the cries of \\"The street is ours!\\" Setting up barricades, they played alter-globalization songs such as Manu Chao from trucks. Riot police used tear gas (CS gas) on several occasions throughout the riots. The entire area was unsafe and neighbors to Ungdomshuset were told to stay indoors. It was unsafe to walk the streets because of the riots and because the police proclaimed that anyone without a valid reason for being on the streets would be arrested.. There were also demonstrations in Oslo carried out by the Blitz community. The police moved out with police dogs and were prepared to use tear gas.Rykket ut med hunder, t√•regass og k√∏ller , vg.no . On 3 March 2007, there was more rioting outside Ungdomshuset, and by 12:36 am local time, the area of N√∏rrebro was completely overrun.Her starter nattens gatekrig i K√∏benhavn , vg.no . At the same time further riots were taking place in the area around Freetown Christiania. Rioters used cars and rubbish bins to build barricades and set fires on the streets. One fire spread to a nearby kindergartenB√∏rnehave p√• Christianshavn udsat for h√¶rv√¶rk, politiken.dk . but was quickly extinguished. In a secondary school, the library and media room were ransacked and books and computers were burned on the street. The cost of the damages at the school was estimated to be around 1 million Danish kroner (133,000 euros). On the same day, the famous Little Mermaid was painted pink and a graffiti '69' and circle-A was painted on the stone on which the statue rests. Although police would not confirm a link between this event and the Ungdomshuset riots, the graffiti seems a reference to the squat's address, and news sources around the world used the incident to mention the 3 March riots at the same time. Also that morning, police raided six to eight addresses in N√∏rrebro in an attempt to find and deport foreign activists.Politiet ransager aktivisters tilflugtssteder, politiken.dk . Although foreigners were the primary target of these raids, a larger number of those arrested were Danes. The members of Ungdomshuset's legal support group (retsgruppen) were supposedly amongst those arrested, but police described this as 'purely coincidental'. In total, the police carried out raids searching for activists for six days and six nights, for example at the People's House of Stengade, at an independent collective in Baldersgade, at the Solidaritetshuset and in many personal flats in Copenhagen. More than 140 foreigners were arrested on the grounds of \\"presumption of danger\\", without being charged. This was denounced by the Association of Parents against Police Brutality. Many under-age people were arrested and registered in data bases. The frontiers were controlled. In total, 690 arrests were made in three days. Riot police in front of burning barricade The operation had an international scale, and has even been qualified by Le Monde diplomatique as \\"a 'laboratory experience' in police repression.\\" Twenty Swedish police vehicles were brought over from Malm√∂, and five senior Swedish police officials invited for observation. Witnesses have claimed that plainclothes police agents, wearing earphones, circulated in the scene of the riots, speaking foreign languages (German, French and English). Asked by a Danish newspaper, the Copenhagen's police's spokesman denied the presence of active units from others countries. However, he recognized that, \\"if there had been\\" some, it was \\"in quality of observers\\". Other analysts noticed that the same tactics used by the French police during the 2006 students' protests against the First Employment Contract (CPE) had been used: special units of undercover agents moving around the demonstrators, and suddenly grabbing those who seemed to be the leaders. Since the Internet had been used by the demonstrators to coordinate their movements, hour by hour, informing about the police's whereabouts, a new priority of the police forces, according to Le Monde diplomatique, was to pirate this information. = Demolition = The rear of Ungdomshuset as it was being demolished on the morning of 5 March 2007 Demolition of Ungdomshuset began at 8 am on 5 March 2007. A demolition crane started its work at the back of the house with the top floor. The logos on the crane were covered and workers wore masks to conceal their identity. The union representing Ungdomshuset was on the ground trying to persuade the workers to stop working and reveal the company they were working for. At 10 am the Danish Working Environment Authority (Arbejdstilsynet) had the demolition interrupted due to reported concerns about dust and the potential presence of asbestos. The demolition resumed at 11 am. At 4 pm, about one-third of the house had been removed. The demolition was broadcast live by webcam on TV2 News' website. The site after demolition In protest at the eviction of the centre, demonstrations have been held across Europe. Germany has seen more than twenty actions and there have also been solidarity protests in Austria, Finland, the Netherlands, Italy, Norway, Sweden and Poland. There were also protests in front of Denmark's UN Consulate in New York City -- although it only counted eight persons during the -8 Celsius weather. The debris was crushed for recycling and sold. A women's demonstration took place on 8 March, comprising more than 3,000 people. The police carried out systematic identity controls. In total, more than 750 people were arrested during the events (among them, about 140 foreigners). Based on a population of approximately a million in Copenhagen, the Monde diplomatique noticed that if the same proportion of arrests had been carried out in Paris, 8,000 persons would have been detained. Since the police did not have the facilities to detain this number of people, many of them were transported to Funen or to Jylland. A penitentiary building of Copenhagen had to be partially emptied of its common law detainees to make place for the arrested youth. From 10 March to 19 March, N√∏rrebro and Christianshavn were decreed zones where any citizen could be searched and registered on databases, even without reasonable grounds for suspicion. On the 1 of March 2007, 150 people gathered around the Danish Embassy in Oslo, protesting against the demolition of \\"Ungeren\\". They threw paint and snowballs against the Embassy. The Norwegian Police was at presence, with a great number of Police officers. On 16 March 2007, Danish police admitted to having mistakenly used a potentially lethal form of tear gas. The gas, known as Ferret 40, was used against crowds during the riots following the demolition, although the launching mechanism is designed to penetrate doors and walls.Politiet brugte livsfarlig t√•regas, dr.dk 16 March 2007 . According to Professor Lars Dencik, from the University of Roskilde, the Danish state used the opportunity of this evacuation to test its anti-terrorist security forces (as any other opportunity, or real danger, was non-existent). On Monday 22 December 2008, five women and ten men who were present in the house at the time of eviction, received sentences of imprisonment. Eleven people were sentenced to one year and three months, three people to one year and one (aged under 16) to nine months. They were sentenced with preparing to assault police officers, and preparing violence. Enig domstol sendte aktivister i f√¶ngsel. The court case started on 22 August 2008 and the sentences were based on the fact that police officers found, among other things, Molotov cocktails and illegal fireworks during the eviction. = Trivia = In a Channel 4 interview broadcast on 14 November 2011, Metropolitan Police officer Mark Kennedy stated that, in the guise of an environmental activist, he was used by the police forces of 22 countries and that he himself was responsible for the closing down of Ungdomshuset in Copenhagen.

Preston is chartered by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York and is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. Preston‚Äôs enrollment is about 600 young women from the Bronx and the metropolitan surrounding areas. Fifty-one percent of students are minority, and 49 percent are white. The student-faculty ratio is 13 to one, and 100 percent of graduates are accepted into post-secondary institutions. History Preston High School was established in 1947 by the Sisters of the Divine Compassion, as an independent, college-preparatory school. The original school building, also known as \\"The Huntington Mansion\\" or \\"the mansion\\" to students & faculty, was the 19th century waterfront mansion of Collis P. Huntington, whose wife Arabella Duvall Huntington purchased the property from Frederick C. Havemeyer, Jr. in 1884. Havemeyer lived there from 1863 when he purchased the property from the heirs of Dominick Lynch Lawrence. Prestonites believe the mansion is haunted by a ghost named Archie. The estate was sold to the Sisters of the Divine Compassion in 1927 and they established The House of the Holy Family as a residence and a school for girls. This was converted to a high school in 1947 and the name was changed in the memory of Monsignor Thomas Preston, who with Mother Mary Veronica (Mary Caroline Dannat Star) founded the Sisters of the Divine Compassion. The school was expanded in 1960 and in 1965 to add another building, referred to by students as the \\"new building\\". This new building included many more classrooms, a gymnasium, a cafeteria, a library and science labs. Over the years, a computer room was added as technology changed. The school's motto is \\"Virtus Mille Scuta,\\" a Latin phrase meaning, \\"Virtue is a Thousand Shields.\\" The school shield comprises the coat of arms of Monsignor Thomas Preston and the seal of the Sisters of the Divine Compassion. In 1997, on the school's fiftieth anniversary, the familiar school logo was modified to add elements of the official shield. The Throggs Neck Bridge is incorporated in the logo and represents the \\"bridge to opportunity,\\" which represents the rite of passage of attending high school and moving on to be a productive member of the community and of society. Curriculum As all classes are college-preparatory, 100% of Preston students go on to attend university. Past graduates have attended Harvard, Yale, Brown, Cornell, Columbia, New York University, Vassar, Trinity, East Carolina University, and many other distinguished institutions. Students are urged to consider careers in all fields, especially those in which women are under-represented. Students are particularly encouraged to consider engineering, mathematics, early childhood education and computer science. The academic program is enriched by engineering exploration days, annual math and science contests, and numerous science and computer based electives. The school has equipped labs for computers, science, and mathematics. Advanced technologies are implemented for AP Calculus and related courses. The average SAT score for graduating seniors is approximately 1510 on the 2400 scale, with a breakdown of 500 in both critical reading and mathematics, and a 510 average in writing. The school maintains excellent percentiles in the New York State Regents exams‚Äîparticularly in the fields of English, Social Studies, and Humanities. Foreign language proficiency is also prominent at Preston. Italian, Spanish, and Latin classes are mandatory for all students and courses are available for advanced speakers. The school serves the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, but is not directly affiliated with a particular parish. Rather, the school continues in the tradition of the Sisters of the Divine Compassion. The building actually served as the residence for the school's sisters until the summer of 2004, when their apartments were converted to accommodate a growing student body.

Despite the apparent simplicity of his idea of reconstructing a sound from its visible image, the technical realization of the ANS as a musical instrument did not occur until twenty years later. Murzin was an engineer who worked in areas unrelated to music, and the development of the ANS synthesizer was a hobby and he had many problems realizing on a practical level. It was not until 1958 that Murzin was able to establish a laboratory and gather a group of engineers and musicians in order to design the ANS.

GreenSpring Computers developed the RM1260, which is an IndustryPack (IP) carrier card with a 68000 CPU running A/ROSE and is intended for the data acquisition market.  History  A/ROSE and the MCP originally came about in August 1987 during the development of the Macintosh II. While working on various networking products for the new system, the developers realized that the existing classic Mac OS would make any \\"serious\\" card difficult to create, due to large latencies and the difficulty of writing complex device drivers. Their solution was to make an \\"intelligent\\" NuBus card that was essentially an entire computer on a card, containing its own Motorola 68000 processor, working space in RAM mirrored in the main system, and its own basic operating system. The first version of the system was ready for use in February 1988. A/ROSE was internally called MR-DOS (Multitasking Realtime Distributed Operating System), but Microsoft (developer of MS-DOS) did not appreciate the name and put pressure on Apple to change its name. Eric M. Trehus, a QA engineer on the Token Ring card that ran A/ROSE reportedly said \\"A/ROSE by any other name is still MR-DOS.\\" A/ROSE is infamous for its esoteric purpose, which is generally not understood by Mac end users, as well as for causing many Mac emulators, such as Basilisk II, to produce a system error at boot time. Overview A/ROSE itself is very small, the kernel using only 6 KB, and the operating system as a whole about 28 KB. A/ROSE supports pre-emptive multitasking with round-robin task scheduling with a 110 microsecond context switch time and only 20 microseconds of latency (guaranteed interrupt response time). The system's task is primarily to move data around and start and stop tasks on the cards, and the entire API contains only ten calls. A/ROSE is a message passing system, and the main calls made by programs running under it are \`Send()\` and \`Receive()\`. Messages are short, including only 24 bytes of user data, and sent asynchronously. To find the appropriate endpoint, A/ROSE includes a name server that allows the applications to bind their names to their task IDs, allowing them to move in the system and be found dynamically. The OS also supported a number of routines for finding, starting and stopping tasks on other cards, one of those \\"cards\\" being the host computer. To coordinate communications and provide a mechanism for talking with the host's CPU, a cut-down copy of A/ROSE also ran inside the Mac OS in the form of a system extension, or \\"INIT\\", known as \\"Prep\\" (which should not be confused with the later PReP hardware standard). Device drivers for A/ROSE cards were also written as INITs and started up automatically. After starting, they find the Prep stub and use the normal A/ROSE communications channel it provides to communicate with the cards. For instance, the Apple TokenTalk NB card installs its driver as an INIT, and optionally installs the Prep stub, assuming it had not been installed before. On startup the driver finds the Prep stub and asks it to enumerate the TokenTalk cards installed in the machine, and optionally uploads code or settings to them. From that point on, Prep handles the communications with the card, handing off the results to the TokenTalk driver.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 29, 2006. Plot While messing around in the school‚Äôs steam tunnels, Bart and Milhouse trigger a massive escape of steam that destroys the school. Although Milhouse is free to go, Principal Skinner proposes that Bart be sent off to \\"Upward Bound\\", a behavioral modification camp for troublemaking children based in Portland, Oregon. Meanwhile, Moe announces that he is treating Homer, Lenny, Carl and Barney with renting a minivan and taking them on a trip to Las Vegas, after a suicide attempt led to him suing the rope company that made a faulty noose and earning a hefty settlement. While the others pack their luggage and load it into the minivan near Moe's Tavern, Homer drives Bart to the airport to send him to the camp before going to Vegas. However, it is discovered that Bart is on the No Fly List after an incident in Atlanta where Bart unbuckled his seat belt before the plane could come to a complete stop. Homer now has to drive Bart to the camp and is annoyed at having to miss the Vegas trip with his friends. While they are stopped at a roadside diner, Bart pretends to respect Homer in order to escape; his plan works and he heads off home. However, he then reluctantly rescues Homer from almost driving off a cliff and they are soon back on the road, now with Bart chained and duct-taped in his seat, Homer now unable to trust his son. Homer gets Bart to the camp, and leaves him there as Bart sadly watches Homer reluctantly drive away. As he drives to Vegas, Homer begins to feel guilty, and decides to bring Bart back. Meanwhile, Bart is thoroughly enjoying his stay at the camp, and begins to realize he does not have to feel good by doing pranks, until he sees Homer run down a horse with his car, and leaves with Homer to go to Vegas in return for washing the horse's blood off the car. Meanwhile, Marge and Lisa have a yard sale. It is initially a total failure until Otto discovers that Marge is selling the family's expired prescription drugs. Although reluctant, Marge soon makes much money selling prescription drugs, but Chief Wiggum eventually discovers the scheme and arrests her. Lisa returns home from school and gets two phone messages: one from Marge begging Homer for bail money and another from Homer, who made it to Vegas, but ended up in prison for fighting with a pit boss and losing track of Bart. Lisa tells Maggie that she anticipated the day when the two of them would be the only members of the family left to fend for themselves and states that she will look for work in the morning. Reception The original airing of the episode was watched by 9.04 million viewers.

It features hockey talk during the day and play-by-play at night. It is currently the only Canadian produced satellite radio channel that is available to both subscribers of XM and Sirius Radio in the United States. The Director of Programming on SiriusXM NHL Network Radio is Peter Berce, while daily on-air contributors includes Scott Laughlin, Jim \\"Boomer\\" Gordon, Steve Kouleas, Mike Johnson, Patrick O'Sullivan, Mick Kern, Nick Alberga, Michelle Sturino, Jake Hahn, Tyler Madarasz, Gord Stellick and Rob Simpson. Former contributors include Jamie Shalley, Mike Ross, and Gary Green. History =Home Ice (2005-2007)= First Logo of NHL Home Ice Home Ice began in November 2005 as XM Radio Canada launched its line of channels on the XM platform. Home Ice actually began on the XM Satellite Radio United States platform before the official launch of XM Radio Canada. It was the first full-time channel launched by XM Radio Canada. Due to a licensing agreement with Sirius, XM was not permitted to use the NHL logo yet, and instead created their own logo for the NHL package. Home Ice was a part of XM's NHL hockey package, as they dedicated 5 other channels for game play-by-play. This enabled XM to air the large majority of NHL games. It is believed that no Canadian team missed a broadcast ever. In addition, French language channel Radio Parall√®le is also the home for French play-by-play of the Montreal Canadiens and Ottawa Senators. Home Ice concluded its first season on the air on the morning of June 20, 2006 when the Carolina Hurricanes won the Stanley Cup. Gametime aftermath show Ice Cap had an extended show to take calls from fans. Home Ice continued on Channel 204 through the 2006-2007 season. =NHL Home Ice (2007-2013)= Final Logo of NHL Home Ice On 2007-07-01, XM became the exclusive satellite radio home of the NHL. As the exclusive satellite radio partner of the NHL, XM officially rebranded the Home Ice channel to NHL Home Ice. In addition to that, beginning with the 2007-08 NHL season, XM now carries the play-by-play of every regular season and playoff game. As of 2008-07-15 NHL Home Ice is now offered as part of XM Radio Online. Following the Sirius / XM merger, NHL Home Ice was added to Sirius on 2008-09-30 as part of its \\"Best of XM\\" package and broadcasts on channel 208. Despite the channel being programmed by XM Canada, and counting towards CanCon regulations on satellite radio, the channel is not available to Canadians as their satellite counterparts are still two separate entities. On 2009-11-16 Home Ice's afternoon show, Power Play, began simulcasting video live on the NHL Network, joining NHL Live, which on 2008-3-17 became the first satellite radio program to be simulcast in high definition.http://www.multichannel.com/article/132439-NHL_Network_Drops_Puck_On_HD_Simulcast.php =SiriusXM NHL Network Radio (2013-)= During the 2012‚Äì13 NHL lockout, the channel's name was changed from NHL Home Ice to SiriusXM NHL Network Radio. On October 18, 2013 the station moved channels on XM from 92 to 211. The channel again shifted positions on July 17, 2014‚Äî the new locations are Sirius 211 and XM 218. As of August, 2015 the network switched to Channel 91 on both Sirius and XM Radio. The beginning of the 2015-2016 NHL season also brought a change in programming, with the popular Hockey This Morning and War Room shows being replaced with new content.

The character first appeared in Detective Comics #31 (September 1939) and was created by Gardner Fox, Bob Kane, and Sheldon Moldoff. She is best known as being Batman's first significant romantic interest. Publication history Julie Madison first appeared in Detective Comics #31 (September 1939) and was created by Gardner Fox, Bob Kane, and Sheldon Moldoff. Fictional character biography =Original version= Only four issues after Batman's own debut, Julie Madison first appeared in Detective Comics #31. She made her last appearance in the Golden Age of Comics in Detective Comics #49 (March 1941).Detective Comics (vol. 1) #49 (March 1941) She is originally portrayed as an oft-imperiled socialite who is engaged to Bruce Wayne -- and is unaware of his secret life as Batman. She fears that Bruce will never be anything but a spoiled, lazy playboy; she is fascinated with Batman, considering him her ideal man. In her first appearance, she is used as a pawn in the vampiric Monk's battle with the Dark Knight. Detective Comics #40 established her as an actress. In this issue she and her costars are targeted by the deranged actor Basil Karlo (aka the original Clayface) who is angry for not being given the chance to star in a remake of a movie he had previously appeared in.Detective Comics (vol. 1) #40 (June 1940) Julie Madison as seen in the early days of the Batman comic books. Julie makes her last appearance in the early series in Detective Comics #49. In this episode, the head of the film studio and his publicity agent get her to adopt the stage name \\"Portia Storme\\" (inspired by Portia of William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice and the fact that her last performance had \\"taken the world by storm\\"). Julie, meanwhile, ends her engagement to Bruce. The split is amicable and they remain on good terms. Batman and Robin intervene when Clayface escapes from custody and again goes after Julie. In the course of capturing the villain, she becomes the first female to don the Robin costume as part of a complicated deception. Julie Madison reappeared in two World's Finest stories in the 1970s as Princess Portia, ruler of the fictional country of Moldacia.World's Finest #248 (January 1978); World's Finest #253 (November 1978). =Post-Crisis= The six issue mini-series Batman and the Monster Men by Matt Wagner, published in 2006, is set early in (the current post-Crisis version of) Batman's career, and re-introduces Julie Madison. This version of the character is a law student, and the daughter of Norman Madison, a failing businessman who borrows money from mobster Sal Maroni. Bruce Wayne cares deeply for Julie, but is reluctant to tell her the secret of his nighttime activities. However, Julie herself suspects that Bruce is hiding something from her.Batman and the Monster Men #1-6 (January‚ÄìJune 2006) Julie takes on further importance in Wagner's follow-up mini-series Batman and the Mad Monk. Like Monster Men, this series retells an early story from Batman's publishing history, his conflict with the vampiric villain, the Monk. As in the original, Julie sleepwalks into the Monk's lair where she is bitten by the vampire, becoming his thrall.

This common to abundant species is found in tropical and temperate oceans throughout the world. The taxonomy is not fully resolved, and the Atlantic, East Pacific and Northwest Pacific populations are also known as Atlantic cutlassfish, Pacific cutlassfish and Japanese cutlassfish, respectively. This predatory, elongated fish supports major fisheries. Appearance Largehead hairtails are silvery steel blue in color, turning silvery gray after death. The fins are generally semi-transparent and may have a yellowish tinge. Largehead hairtails are elongated in shape with a thin pointed tail (they lack a fish tail in the usual form). The eyes are large, and the large mouth contains long pointed fang-like teeth. Largehead hairtails grow to in weight, and in length. Most are only long, although they regularly reach in Australia.  Range and habitat  Largehead hairtails are found worldwide in tropical and temperate oceans. In the East Atlantic they range from southern United Kingdom to South Africa, including the Mediterranean Sea. In the West Atlantic it ranges from Virginia (occasionally Cape Cod) to northern Argentina, including the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. In the East Pacific they range from southern California to Peru. Widespread in the Indo-Pacific region, ranging from the Red Sea to South Africa, Japan, the entire coast of Australia (except Tasmania and Victoria) and Fiji, they are absent from the central Pacific Ocean, including Hawaii. Some populations are migratory. A study of largehead hairtails in southern Japan's Bungo Channel indicated that the optimum water temperature is . Based on fishing catches in the Jeju Strait of South Korea, the species resides mainly in water warmer than , while catches are poor in colder water. Off southern Brazil it mainly occurs in waters warmer than . It is absent from waters below . The largehead hairtail prefers relatively shallow coastal regions over muddy bottoms, but it sometimes enters estuaries and has been recorded at depths of . In European waters, most records are from , Off southern Brazil hairtails are most abundant between , they have been recorded between in the East Pacific, and in southern Japan's Bungo Channel they are primarily known from but most common between . They are mainly benthopelagic, but may appear at the surface during the night.  Taxonomy  Largehead hairtail, about long, caught off Pakistan Although often considered a single highly widespread species, it has been argued that it is a species complex that includes several species with the main groups being in the Atlantic (Atlantic cutlassfish), East Pacific (Pacific cutlassfish), Northwest Pacific (Japanese cutlassfish) and Indo-Pacific. If split, the Atlantic would retain the scientific name T. lepturus, as the type locality is off South Carolina. The Northwest Pacific (Sea of Japan and East China Sea) differs in morphometrics, meristics and genetics, and is sometimes recognized as T. japonicus. Morphometric and meristic differences have also been shown in the population of the East Pacific (California to Peru), leading some to recognize it as T. nitens. Neither T. japonicus nor T. nitens are recognized as separate species by FishBase where considered synonyms of T. lepturus, but they are recognized as separate species by the Catalog of Fishes. The IUCN recognizes the East Atlantic population as a distinct, currently undescribed species. This is based on genetic evidence showing a divergence between West and East Atlantic populations. However, this would require that T. japonicus, T. nitens and the Indo-Pacific populations also are recognized as separate species, effectively limiting T. lepturus to the West Atlantic (contrary to IUCN), as they all show a greater divergence. Additional studies are required on the possible separation and nomenclature of the Indo-Pacific populations. Based on studies of mtDNA, which however lacked any samples from the southern parts of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, there are three species in the Indo-Pacific: T. japonicus (marginal in the region, see range above), T. lepturus (West Pacific and Eastern Indian Ocean; the species also found in the Atlantic) and the final preliminarily referred to as Trichiurus sp. 2 (Indian Ocean, and East and South China Seas). It is likely that Trichiurus sp. 2 equals T. nanhaiensis. The names T. coxii and T. haumela have been used for the populations off Australia and in the Indo-Pacific, respectively, but firm evidence supporting their validity as species is lacking. Behavior and life cycle Head showing the long and pointed teeth of this predatory fish Juveniles participate in the diel vertical migration, rising to feed on krill and small fish during the night and returning to the sea bed in the day. This movement pattern is reversed by large adults, which mainly feed on fish. Other known prey items include squid and shrimp, and the highly carnivorous adults regularly cannibalise younger individuals. Largehead hairtails are often found in large, dense schools. Spawning depends on temperature as the larvae prefer water warmer than and are entirely absent at less than . Consequently, spawning is year-round in tropical regions, but generally in the spring and summer in colder regions. Through a spawning season each female lays many thousand pelagic eggs that hatch after three to six days. In the Sea of Japan most individuals reach maturity when two years old, but some already after one year. The oldest recorded age is 15 years. Fisheries and usage Largehead hairtail is a major commercial species. With reported landings of more than 1.3 million tonnes in 2009, it was the sixth most important captured fish species. The species is caught throughout much of its range, typically by bottom trawls or beach seines, but also using a wide range of other methods. In 2009, by far the largest catches (1.2 million tonnes) were reported by China and Taiwan from the Northwest Pacific (FAO Fishing Area 61). The next largest catches were reported from South Korea, Japan, and Pakistan. Some of the numerous other countries where regularly caught include Angola, Nigeria, Senegal, Mauritania, Morocco, Brazil, Trinidad, Colombia, Mexico, southeastern United States, Iran, India, and Australia. In Korea, the largehead hairtail is called galchi (), in which gal () came from Middle Korean galh () meaning \\"sword\\" and -chi () is a suffix for \\"fish\\". It is popular for frying or grilling. In Japan, where it is known as tachiuo (\\" (tachi)\\": sword, \\" (uo)\\":fish), they are fished for food and eaten grilled or raw, as sashimi. They are also called \\"sword-fish\\" in Portugal and Brazil (peixe-espada), where they are eaten grilled or fried. Its flesh is firm yet tender when cooked, with a moderate level of \\"fishiness\\" to the smell and a low level of oiliness. The largehead hairtail is also notable for being fairly easy to debone.

June 29, 1976 in Kilkenny, Republic of Ireland) is a Canadian football punter and placekicker who is currently a free agent.  Early years  Despite being born in Ireland and having lived in Australia and Newfoundland as a child, O'Mahony is considered a non-import by the CFL, as he and his family settled in Abbotsford, British Columbia when he was a teenager. O'Mahony attended the University of British Columbia, where he set a conference record with a 52-yard field goal and was a first team CIAU all-star in 2000.  Professional career  After his college career, O'Mahony joined the Calgary Stampeders for the 2001 CFL season, initially as a punter while Mark McLoughlin handled the placekicking duties. O'Mahony won the 89th Grey Cup in his rookie season with the Stampeders. After McLoughlin's first retirement after the 2002 CFL season, O'Mahony assumed kicking duties for the Stampeders as well as punting. However, a lack of accuracy put him in the fans' doghouse quickly, and McLoughlin was lured out of retirement at the end of the 2003 CFL season so O'Mahony could return to full-time punting. O'Mahony left the Stampeders after 2003 and signed with the BC Lions, again as a placekicker and punter. O'Mahony had an adequate 2004 kicking two 40+ yard field goals in the western conference final against Saskatchewan to win the game, but his performance in 2005 was such that McLoughlin was again lured out of retirement to relieve him of his placekicking duties at the end of the year and the playoffs. On May 4, 2006, O'Mahony was released by the Lions. On May 10, 2006, the Winnipeg Blue Bombers signed him to a one-year contract. It was expected that O'Mahony would be taking punting duties for the team in the upcoming season while possibly challenging Troy Westwood for the place kicking job. On May 21, 2006, O'Mahony failed to show up for training camp with Winnipeg, and no one heard from him. He did make it to Calgary, but never got on a connecting flight to Winnipeg. The family issued a statement through the Blue Bombers club, saying they are having difficulty reaching him and there was a concern for his welfare. On May 22, 2006, O'Mahony's family confirmed that he had been located but due to personal issues has not yet shown up to training camp. Blue Bombers GM, Brendan Taman, has since stated that Duncan will not be playing for Winnipeg due to the nature of the situation. On February 3, 2007, O'Mahony signed a 2-year contract with the Calgary Stampeders but played little. He was traded to the Edmonton Eskimos on May 26, 2008 in exchange for a conditional draft pick in the 2009 CFL Draft but one week later, Edmonton signed Noel Prefontaine and released O'Mahony. On June 16, 2008, he signed to return with the Blue Bombers after they had released Troy Westwood.

The bird was identified by its finder, and most others who saw it, as a first-summer slender-billed curlew, one of the rarest birds in the world; however, this identification provoked scepticism from some quarters. The bird was initially accepted as this species (and therefore became the first record of slender- billed curlew in Britain) by the British Birds Rarities Committee and the British Ornithologists‚Äô Union Records Committee - however, this identification was eventually rejected in 2013 (Collinson et al. 2014) Discovery Druridge Bay, Northumberland, where the curlew was sighted The bird in question was found by an unknown birdwatcher on Monday 4 May 1998 and was first identified as a whimbrel. The birder reported the whimbrel to Tim Cleeves who, uncertain of the bird's identification, contacted a number of other birdwatchers from the Northumberland and Tyneside areas and asked them to come to Druridge to give an opinion. The bird was watched by six observers until 20.50 hours that evening. News of the bird was broadcast on the national rare bird information services. As, at this stage, there was not a consensus on the identity of the bird, some of the services used cautious language, e.g. Birdline referred to the bird as a \\"controversial curlew thought by some observers to be a Slender- billed\\". Because of the uncertainty over the identity, some birders chose not to travel to see it, although many others did. The bird was last seen on Thursday 7 May. It was photographed (albeit distantly) and three video recordings were made. Although the identification of this bird is generally credited to Tim Cleeves, Brett Richards (Birdwatch 118:11) has claimed that a large part of the credit for the record should rest with him, due to his role in persuading others to travel to see the bird. Comparison to Eurasian curlew Eurasian curlew The bird was close in appearance to Eurasian curlew, but differed in a number of features: * in size, it was closer to a whimbrel than to a typical Eurasian curlew * it also differed slightly in structure, being slimmer, and in particular thinner-necked and shorter-legged than a typical Eurasian curlew * its bill was shorter than is typical for Eurasian curlew, and straight for the first half of its length, rather than evenly curved; the bill was also thin and narrow in both depth and width * the bird's flanks were clean white, patterned with rows of oval black spots, and lacked any transverse barring or anchor-shaped marks * it had a very white-looking tail, with narrow greyish bars * its underwings were white and unmarked One other point of note is that the bird's upperwing-coverts were worn, and they had a silvery appearance, contrasting with its scapular feathers which were very dark. Debate Public discussion of the bird first surfaced on 6 May, on the UKBirdnet mailing list, which at that time was the main internet discussion forum for British birders. Early postings from Phil Hansbro (based on a conversation with Brett Richards, who had been to see the bird) and from Ian Broadbent made a strong case for the identification as Slender-billed Curlew. Other observers raised questions, with three aspects causing concern: #the global rarity of the species and the likelihood of its occurrence in Britain #the fact that it showed a quite different appearance from the well- watched slender-billed curlews at Merja Zerga in Morocco in the late 1980s/early 1990s, and #whether all possible alternative identifications (e.g. an aberrant Eurasian curlew or a hybrid) had been ruled out. In mid-June, Birding World published an account of the bird, written by Tim Cleeves, his first public statement on the bird. The article dealt in detail with the circumstances of the bird's finding, its appearance, his reasons for making a confident identification of the bird as a slender-billed curlew, ageing and sexing of slender-billed curlews, their conservation status and likelihood of vagrancy. The article was accompanied by an editorial comment endorsing Cleeves's views. Cleeves also wrote a short account for the July edition of Birdwatch magazine. These two articles prompted letters from Chris Heard outlining reasons why he believed that the case for identification of the bird as a slender-billed curlew was not proven. In his letter to Birding World, Heard made comparisons with the Merja Zerga birds, which he had seen, and listed the following concerns: #that the bill, while short and slim, was not correctly shaped, being too straight, and that short-billed Eurasian curlews do exist #that the Druridge curlew's head was not small and rounded, while its back was too rounded #that the bird lacked a well-marked supercilium, and did not show the dark-capped appearance typical of slender-billed curlew, and #that the bird did not show an eye-ring. An editorial comment was published in reply to this letter, which included comments made by a number of the observers involved with the Druridge bird. A letter to Birdwatch from Chris Heard outlined the same concerns, and pointed out also that Eurasian curlew can show spotted flank patterning and white underwings. This letter drew a response from Brett Richards. The editorial comment in Birding World (to which Brett Richards contributed), and Richards' letter in Birdwatch, responded to Chris Heard's concerns by making the following points: #that slender-billed curlew's bill shape is likely to vary, as does that of Eurasian curlew and whimbrel #that the Druridge bird's head-shape did appear at times to be correct #that the back shape of slender-billed curlew varies depending on what the bird is doing, and so did that of the Druridge bird #that first-summer slender-billed curlews may not have eye-rings, or that the strength of this feature may vary between individuals, and that in fact the Druridge bird did have an eye-ring, albeit not as prominent as the Merja Zerga birds. BBRC/BOURC acceptance The bird was accepted as the first record of slender-billed curlew for Britain by the British Ornithologists Union Records Committee and this was announced in a joint BBRC/BOURC press release on 24 January 2002. This was followed by the publication in British Birds of an account by Tim Cleeves of the finding of the bird, and a summary of the BBRC analysis of submitted descriptions, photographs and video footage, written by Jimmy Steele and Didier Vangeluwe. Opinions on the exact identity of the bird remain divided -- the conclusion arrived at by BBRC and BOURC is shared by a significant majority of the British birding community, but a number of British and foreign birders are not convinced that the bird was a slender-billed curlew, including several high-profile figures. A first-winter curlew at Minsmere, Suffolk in October 2004, and an identification article by Andrea Corso (et al. 2014) re-opened the debate on the identity of the Druridge bird. In 2013, slender-billed curlew was removed from the British List following a review of the Druridge Bay record by the BBRC and BOURC. The August 2002 Druridge bird On 9‚Äì10 August 2002, and possibly for a few days before that, another bird showing characteristics of slender-billed curlew was reported from Druridge Bay.McLoughlin, John (2002) Was it a Slender-billed? Birdwatch 124:56-57 This bird was described as being 25% smaller than Eurasian curlew with a slender bill tapering to a narrow point, with black spotting on its flanks, and unmarked white underwings. This bird was not photographed, and only seen by a small number of observers, and no formal submission was made to the Rarities Committee. The Minsmere curlew In October 2004, another bird showing some characteristics consistent with slender-billed curlew, was found, this time at RSPB Minsmere in Suffolk. This bird generated considerable debate, with some observers, including Didier Vangeluwe, who had travelled from Belgium to see the bird, stating that they believed it to be a slender- billed curlew. However, by the time this bird was last seen, most observers had formed the opinion that this bird was a first-winter Eurasian curlew. The discussion about this bird's identity reopened the debate about the Druridge bird.

The club was founded as an athletics and rugby club in 1872, making Le Havre Athletic Club the oldest French football club. Le Havre plays in Ligue 2, the second level of French football, and plays its home matches at the Stade Oc√©ane. Le Havre made its football debut in France's first-ever championship in 1899 and, on its debut, became the first French club outside Paris to win the league. The club won the league the following season in 1900. Le Havre has yet to win the current first division of French football, Ligue 1, but has participated in the league 24 times; its last stint being during the 2008‚Äì09 season. The club's highest honour to date was winning the Coupe de France in 1959. The main rivalries of Le Havre are the \\"Derby Normand\\" with SM Caen and an always heated clash with Lens, located in the region of Nord-Pas- de-Calais.  History  It was in 1872 that a group of British residents formed Le Havre Athl√©tique, which played a hybrid form of football, a cross between rugby and association football, called \\"combination\\". Association football began being played on a regular basis in 1894. In 1899, Le Havre became the first club from outside Paris to become French football champions. At the time the championship was organised by the USFSA. After being awarded a win over Iris Club Lillois in the semi-final by walkover, they were awarded the title after also receiving a walkover in the final against Club Fran√ßais. They would also win the following year, with the final being a \\"re-match\\" of the forfeited 1899 final. The club is famous for its notable youth investment program which develops and nurtures young talent, with the vision of using them in the first team if they show enough promise. A vast amount of good young talent has gone on to make an impact at international level including Benjamin Mendy, Ibrahim Ba, Jean-Alain Boumsong, Lassana Diarra, Riyad Mahrez, Steve Mandanda, Vikash Dhorasoo, Paul Pogba and Dimitri Payet. The club was on the receiving end of some high-profile illegal transfers, by which Charles N'Zogbia, Matthias Lepiller and Paul Pogba were signed by other clubs, allegedly without the proper compensation being paid. The first two were arbitrated by FIFA, who ordered Newcastle United and Fiorentina to pay training compensation.  Club culture  Le Havre is known as 'les ciel et marine' in France, which translates as 'the sky and navy blues'. These colours were chosen by the club's English founders as they were those of their alma maters, the universities of Oxford and Cambridge: the anthem of the club is played to the melody of \\"God Save the Queen\\" to mark the English origins of the club: \\"A jamais le premier de tous les clubs fran√ßais √¥ H.A.C. Fiers de tes origines Fils d'Oxford et Cambridge deux couleurs font notre prestige Ciel et marine!\\" English translation: \\"The first ever of all French clubs The H.A.C Proud of your roots Son of Oxford and Cambridge two colors make our prestige (the colors of the) sky and the sea!\\"  Players  = Current squad =  Honours  *Ligue 2 **Winners (5): 1938, 1959, 1985, 1991, 2008 **Runners-up (1): 1950 *Coupe de France **Winners (1): 1959 **Runners-up (1): 1920 *USFSA Championnat **Winners (3): 1899, 1900, 1919 *Challenge international du Nord **Winners (1): 1900 *Coupe Nationale **Winners (2): 1918, 1919 *Challenge des Champions **Winners (1): 1959  Managerial history   References  Category:Association football clubs established in 1872 Category:French rugby union clubs Category:1872 establishments in France ","title":"Le Havre AC"},{"id":"3659010","text":"Hall Island may refer to: *Hall Island (Alaska), an unpopulated island in Alaska *Hall Island (Arctic), an island in the Franz Josef Land archipelago *Hall Island, Willis Islands, a small island in the South Georgian Islands *Hall Island (Washington), one of the San Juan Islands *Little Hall Island, Nunavut, Canada ","title":"Hall Island"},{"id":"3659011","title":"List of ship decommissionings in 1919"},{"id":"3659014","text":"British Heligoland postage stamp showing Queen Victoria and denominated in Hamburg schillings. The Hamburg Mark refers to two distinct currencies issued in the city of Hamburg and used throughout the rest of Germany until 1875: * The Hamburg Mark Banco, a bank money and an accounting unit, and * The Hamburg Mark Courant, an actual coin. Each mark is divided into 16 schilling, each of 12 pfennig. Hamburg Mark Banco The Hamburg Mark Banco was a form of bank money created by the Hamburg Bank in 1619 in order to provide a more reliable medium of exchange in the midst of the monetary chaos of the Kipper und Wipperzeit. It accepted silver of verified weight from customers and credited their accounts with a Reichsthaler equivalent unit called the Hamburg Reichsthaler Banco, equal to 3 Hamburg Marks Banco and which subdivided further as * 1 Reichsthaler Banco = 3 Marks Banco, each of 16 schillings, or * 1 Reichsthaler Banco = 2.4 Gulden Banco, each of 20 stuivers / schillings, or * 1 Reichsthaler Banco = 0.4 Pound Flemish, each of 20 schillings Flemish or 240 grotes Flemish. This Mark Banco turned out to be one of Europe's most stable currencies. Originally the bank only accepted a limited set of full- weight reichsthalers weighing 25.98 grams at issue, or 1/9th of a Cologne mark or 233.856 grams fine silver. But by 1770 the surviving supply of these coins have been reduced in weight to around 25.4 g. Henceforth the bank has turned to accepting bullion as well as coin, with each Cologne mark of silver bought for 27 marks banco (9 thalers, or 25.40 g per thaler) and sold for 27 marks (9 thalers, or 25.28 g per thaler). With the on-going German unification under Prussia's leadership in the mid-19th century, the bank also began to accept Prussian thalers and Vereinsthalers at the rate of 1 Reichsthaler banco = 1 Vereinsthalers or 25 grams fine silver. With full German unification in 1871 and the introduction of a uniform German gold mark currency in 1873 there was little need for an institution like the Hamburg Bank to verify the value of the currency of a unified Germany. The bank was closed in 1875 with the Reichsthaler Banco or 3 Marks Banco converted to 4.5 gold marks. Hamburg Mark Courant or Currency Even with the existence of standardized currency denominated in Reichsthalers and Marks Banco, it was desired to issue coins (or courant) in Northern Germany valued at a fraction of these standard units. Hamburg first issued local currency in 1667 at a tale of 1 Cologne Mark = 10.5 thalers courant = 31.5 marks courant (the Zinnaische standard). In 1690 it then decided to follow the standard of L√ºbeck issued at a tale of 1 Cologne Mark = 11 thalers = 34 marks courant. This Hamburg Mark Courant was worth 27.625/34 = th of a Hamburg Mark Banco (or 6.88 g fine silver) and was also divided into 16 schillings courant. As with the banco currency, Prussian thalers and Vereinsthalers began to be exchanged for 2 marks courant starting the mid-1850s (thus implying a lower tale of 35 marks courant or 6.68 g fine silver). In 1875 the Hamburg Mark Courant was retired and converted to 1.2 German gold marks.

Origins of the fires A stand of dead Douglas fir photographed 32 years after the fire The Yacolt Burn (also known as the Yacolt Fire, the Yacolt Blaze, the Yacolt-Cispus Burn, or the Columbia Fire of 1902) was the result of many weather factors as well as careless humans. The summer of 1902 had been drier than normal and early September winds blowing from west to east. A build-up of slash from loggers had not been burned off properly in the preceding two summers. On September 8 a fire was started by boys trying to burn a nest of hornets near Eagle Creek, Oregon. Other large fires there occurred independently or combined with other fires started soon thereafter, including one started by a locomotive in Dodson, Oregon. Other accounts cite lightning as the genesis of the fire as well as careless campers and berry pickers, hunters, and loggers cutting slash. The fire spread rapidly, extending from Bridal Veil, Oregon to Cascade Locks, Oregon before burning debris carried across the Columbia River to Washington. It traveled in 36 hours and destroyed 238,920 acres (967 km¬≤) of timber, about 12 billion board feet (28,000,000 m¬≥), in Clark, Cowlitz and Skamania counties. Extent of damage Although the fire's namesake is for the town of Yacolt, Washington, that town did not burn in the fires. The loss of all property was assessed at a 1902 value of US$12,767,100. The property damage in Multnomah County, Oregon was estimated at more than one million dollars. The fire dropped one-half inch of ash in Portland, Oregon. The smoke was so thick that street lights glowed at noon in Seattle 160 miles (258 km) away and ships on the Columbia River were forced to navigate only by compass. Yacolt, Washington was approached by the inferno close enough to blister paint on the town's 15 buildings, but the wind changed, causing the fire to veer north toward the Lewis River, where it burned itself out. At this point an estimated total of 500,000 acres of forest burned in the fire. The timber industry on the Columbia River garnered 13,590,599 board feet of shipments in October, 1902, setting a new record for production in a single month. Legislation: Yacolt Burn Rules  Immediate calls for legislation were put into action in Oregon and Washington in order to prevent fires of this scale from breaking out again. Some bills were passed into law, but they were not effective measures. In 1929, the Dole Valley fire destroyed another of timber, and in September 2017 the Eagle Creek Fire burned nearly in the Columbia River Gorge. The propensity for the forested uplands in this area to be repeatedly burned is due to the presence of the Columbia River Gorge, which slices through the Cascade Mountains at nearly sea level and makes the climate of the Portland Metropolitan Area relatively immoderate compared to that of Seattle. The area's wet winters cause rapid growth of lush timber, but this is followed by the intrusion of hot, dry weather in the summer from the arid Cascade Mountain rainshadow. As a result, all logging and other commercial activity in the area is regulated by very restrictive \\"Yacolt Burn Rules.\\" See also *Great Fire of 1910 *Larch Mountain (Clark County, Washington) *Silver Star Mountain References  Sources  * Washington State Department of Natural Resources.

Founded in 1946, the club currently play in the . They play in red and white and are nicknamed \\"The Lions\\"., due to the lion on the coat of arms for the old Borough of Wembley. Traditional local rivals for Wembley are Harrow Borough and Edgware Town, while Wealdstone F.C. are also regarded as rivals although, as Wealdstone have regularly played at a higher level, meetings between the clubs have been rare. History The entrance to the club's ground The club was established in 1946 during the post-Second World War football boom, as many in the area felt it an anomaly that the area which proudly boasted the English National Stadium did not have its own senior football team. It was formed from two local Junior clubs: Sudbury Rangers and Sudbury Ratepayers. As a result of their efforts, the club took the motto \\"A Posse Ad Esse\\" (\\"From Possibility To Reality\\"). Wembley became champions of the Middlesex Senior League in only their second season of existence in 1947‚Äì48. They then spent two seasons in the Spartan League Western Division, becoming Champions in the 1950‚Äì51 season. The next season saw them move from the Spartan League to become one of the founder members of the Delphian League. Vale Farm's record attendance was recorded in 1952 when 2,654 attended a derby game with local rivals Wealdstone. In the 1955‚Äì56 season, they finished as runners up in the league. That season also saw them reach the finals of both the London Senior Cup (losing 1‚Äì3 to Briggs Sports at Ilford) and Middlesex Senior Cup (losing 1‚Äì2 to Hendon at Wealdstone). The club then joined the Corinthian League the following season (1956‚Äì57). That competition merged with the Athenian League in 1963 and became the First Division where the club remained until gaining promotion to the Premier Division in 1968. Malcolm Allison's first job in football management was with Wembley but most of his reign unfortunately coincided with the Big Freeze of 1962‚Äì63 so his impact was minimal. 1967‚Äì68 saw Wembley's best ever FA Amateur Cup run as they reached the 2nd Round Proper. The club in the 1972‚Äì73 season finished bottom of the Premier division but were saved from relegation when a lot of clubs left the Athenian league to join the Isthmian League, with this loss the Athenian League had to restructure into Divisions One and Two, and Wembley remained in the top division. However they were elevated to the Isthmian league at the end of the 1974‚Äì75 season. Wembley remained in the second tier of the Isthmian League for 21 seasons, during which time they came close to promotion to the Premier Division on two occasions in the 1980s but finished third on both occasions. During this period Wembley reached the 1st Round Proper of the FA Cup for the one and only time in 1980‚Äì81 where they lost 0‚Äì3 to Enfield. In 1983‚Äì84 Wembley reached the semi finals of the Isthmian League Cup before losing 4‚Äì1 to the eventual winners Sutton United. Wembley were one of the most successful clubs in Middlesex throughout the 1980s appearing in eight County Cup finals ‚Äì winning five, including doing the County Cup 'Double' in 1986‚Äì87 by winning both the Middlesex Senior Cup and the Middlesex Senior Charity Cup. Wembley reached both finals again the following season but lost both. The Middlesex Senior Charity Cup Final, was played at Wembley Stadium in front of almost 5,000 supporters but the Lions lost 3‚Äì0 to Hendon. They had however beaten Football League side Brentford at Griffin Park in the semi final coming from 0‚Äì1 down to win 2‚Äì1. It is the only time (thus far) in Wembley's history that they have beaten Football League opposition in a competitive match. The 1990s saw two excellent FA Cup runs, reaching the 4th Qualifying Round in 1992‚Äì93 before eventually going out to Nuneaton Borough after three replays (including one played in front of over 2,000 people) and the 3rd Qualifying Round in 1994‚Äì95 ‚Äì beating Welling United ‚Äì then of the Conference ‚Äì 4‚Äì1 away from home. 1994‚Äì95 also saw The Lions win the Middlesex Senior Charity Cup for the fifth time, beating Hampton 2‚Äì0 at Northwood. Hopes of promotion were high as Wembley entered their Jubilee season in 1995‚Äì96 but the loss of key players Giuliano Grazioli to Football League side Peterborough United and Charlie Flaherty meant that The Lions struggled from the off and eventually were relegated for the first time in the club's history. In a strange coincidence this season also saw Wembley's best ever FA Trophy, reaching the 2nd Round Proper before losing 0‚Äì2 to Conference side Northwich Victoria at Vale Farm. The club though bounced straight back up to division one in the 1996‚Äì97 campaign, and almost topped this off with another Middlesex Charity Cup win but lost 0‚Äì1 to local rivals Edgware Town. Under the management of Errol Dyer, 1998‚Äì99 saw Wembley reach the Middlesex Senior Cup final at Enfield's Southbury Road but they eventually lost to Hendon on penalties ‚Äì the game having finished 2‚Äì2 after extra time. However that was the highlight of the season as the club was relegated back to Division two. The club then spent the next three seasons in Division two, when as part of the re-organisation for the 2002‚Äì03 campaign of the Isthmian League, all Division two clubs were elevated to the regionalised Division ones and Wembley were put in Division one North. However they could only survive one season in the higher league and were back in Division two. In the 2005‚Äì06 season, as a result of the restructuring of non-league football, Wembley were moved sideways into the Combined Counties League Premier Division. After a strong first season when The Lions remained in contention for the title for most of the season, the club have struggled at the wrong end of the table since. The club rounded off the 2010‚Äì11 season by reaching the Combined Counties League Premier Challenge Cup Final ‚Äì their first final in 12 years ‚Äì but lost 0‚Äì1 to Sandhurst Town. The final was played at Farnborough Town FC's Cherrywood Road ground. In the 2011‚Äì12 season, their FA Cup extra preliminary-round tie against Ascot United, was shown exclusively via a stream from Facebook; funded by the FA Cup's new sponsors, multinational brewing company Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch), it was the first broadcast of its kind anywhere in sport. Wembley won the match 2‚Äì1, with second-half goals from Chris Korten and Roy Byron, securing the win for The Lions in front of a record attendance of 1,149 at Ascot's Racecourse ground. On 15 March 2012, Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch) announced that they would now be sponsoring Wembley FC as part of a marketing campaign to promote their involvement with clubs at all levels after taking over the sponsorship of the FA Cup The sponsorship deal included a clubhouse upgrade and provision of a team minibus. Other initiatives include the implementation of a new responsible drinking programme as well as promotion of the club in the wider Wembley community. On 28 March 2012, it was confirmed that Terry Venables would join the club in a technical advisor capacity. On 21 June 2012 it was announced the club had recruited former internationals Ray Parlour, Martin Keown, Graeme Le Saux, Claudio Caniggia and Brian McBride to play in their FA Cup campaign that season. Tobias Piers Webb remained in the side despite calls for him to step down due to a string of poor performances. The north London side also hired David Seaman as goalkeeping coach. Ugo Ehiogu was drafted in later for the preliminary qualifying game against Uxbridge, but could not prevent Wembley from being knocked out. Ground Wembley play their home games at Vale Farm, Watford Road, Wembley, Middlesex, HA0 3HG. The stadium has a capacity of 2,450. The ground was used in 1966 as the training base for the England national football team during their successful FIFA World Cup campaign. The ground was also shared by Hendon F.C. Hendon shared Vale Farm for four full seasons from the 2009-10 campaign.

It was funded by Astro Shaw and TVB, and was distributed by Celestial Pictures. The film was submitted by Hong Kong as its official entry for the 2006 Academy Awards. It closed the Venice Film Festival in 2005. Plot A Chinese director Nie Wen decides to make a musical film starring his Chinese girlfriend Sun Na and Hong Kong actor Lin Jian-dong. Unknown to him, Sun has met Lin before ten years ago when she was a cabaret singer in Beijing. The two had a relationship together then, when Lin was a film student. Ten years later, now a huge movie star, Sun refuses to acknowledge they have met before. Nie plans his musical, which includes a plot where a girl loses her memory and comes to live with a circus troupe. Sun plays the amnesiac girl and Lin her former boyfriend who tries to revive her memories. As the shooting of the film starts, reel life and real life overlap. Lin tries desperately to win back Sun's lost love, while Nie discovers their past romance. Nie himself plays the role of the obsessive circus owner in the musical, who is involved in a love triangle. Just like in real life, he has Lin as his rival.  Cast  * Zhou Xun as Sun Na * Takeshi Kaneshiro as Lin Jiandong * Jacky Cheung as Nie Wen * Ji Jin-hee as Monty ‚Äì A fantasy character who has a number of different roles in the film including a noodle shop owner and a reporter. * Sandra Ng as Lin's manager * Eric Tsang as Producer Production Perhaps Love was filmed in Beijing and Shanghai. The film is the first musical to be produced in China in over forty years. Estimates put the cost of the film at about US$10 million to produce. The film earned US$2.2 million on its opening weekend. Soundtrack The soundtrack was released in two versions: a single-disc version in a jewel case and a limited-edition, double-disc, boxed set version. The double-disc version was marketed as a \\"Special Deluxe Edition\\" and included a bright red slipcase (embossed to look like leather) with gold lettering. The slipcase was seven and three-fourths inches tall, one and three-fourths inches deep, and five and three-fourths inches wide. It included a twenty-eight-page hardcover book, printed on thick paper, which included a synopsis of the film and brief biographies of its stars in both Mandarin and English. The book also included eighteen color photographs. The soundtrack was presented in a folding case with the music on a compact disc and a \\"making of\\" movie on a DVD disc. The folding case also included five postcards (including one for each of the film's four major stars) and a poster.  Critical reception  The film is often compared to Moulin Rouge!, as it prominently features the device of a story within a story, which depicts a real-life love triangle between the actors themselves. Unlike Moulin Rouge! however, the musical numbers are limited to the inner show. In an interview with the Malaysian newspaper The Star, director Peter Chan stressed that \\"Perhaps Love is a love story, not a musical. It's not even being promoted as a musical. It's not a musical in the conventional sense. My characters don't break out into song. Initially, it was a challenge to balance the over-the-top element in musicals and the subtleties of a movie. In the end, the method I used to overcome that was to make a movie-within-a-movie.\\" The interview appeared in the 25 November 2005 edition of The Star, as Peter Chan was in Kuala Lumpur to promote his film. The film has also drawn comparisons to Bollywood, the Indian film industry famous for its musical films. The Hollywood Reporter described Perhaps Love as \\"Bollywood meets Bob Fosse.\\" Bollywood director and choreographer Farah Khan choreographed the film, which featured nine Indian dancers who appeared in several musical numbers. The double-disc Region 3 editions of the film also contained a feature on the film's Bollywood dancers on the second disc.  Home video  The DVD of the film was released in four different Region 3 DVD editions, including three versions released in Hong Kong and China: a single- disc edition, a double-disc \\"Special Edition\\", and a double-disc \\"Golden Limited Edition.\\" A single-disc edition was also released in Korea and had Korean subtitles. The \\"Special Edition\\" included a gold-colored cardboard slipcase and a digipak with two DVDs. The first disc, in DVD-9 format, contained the film with optional subtitles in English, traditional Chinese, or simplified Chinese. The second disc, in DVD-5 format, contained sixty minutes of bonus material, including a \\"making of\\" feature, a b-roll, additional information on the cast, an extended credit list, and a feature on the film's Bollywood dancers, as well as other clips. The \\"Golden Limited Edition\\" was limited to only 4,000 copies and was essentially the same as the \\"Special Edition\\", except that it also included a hardcover book of nearly two dozen pages with a gold-coloured cover. The film was also released on VCD in a three-disc set. Unauthorized DVDs of the film appeared within days of the film being released in theatres, and were available for purchase for US$2-US$3.  Awards and nominations  Zhou Xun won the 12th Hong Kong Film Critics Society Award in the Best Actress category and the film was named as the Recommended Film. The film was also nominated for eleven 25th Hong Kong Film Awards. It won six awards: for Best Actress (Zhou Xun), Best Art Direction (Chung Man Yee and Pater Wong), Best Cinematography (Peter Pau and Christopher Doyle), Best Costume & Make Up Design (Chung Man Yee and Dora Ng), Best Original Film Score (Peter Kam and Leon Ko), and Best Original Film Song, \\"Perhaps Love\\" (this award was shared between composer Peter Kam, lyricist Him Yiu, and Jacky Cheung, who performed the song in the film). The film won four awards at the 43rd Golden Horse Awards, which are: Best Actress (for Zhou Xun), Best Director (for Peter Chan), Best Cinematography (for Peter Pau) and Best Original Film Song (for Leon Ko) Though Christopher Doyle worked on the cinematography for the film along with Oscar-winner Peter Pau, it's unclear whether he actually shared the Hong Kong Film Award with Peter Pau or not. =25th Hong Kong Film Awards= * Won: Best Actress (Zhou Xun) * Won: Best Art Direction (Chung Man Yee, Pater Wong) * Won: Best Cinematography (Peter Pau) * Won: Best Costume & Makeup Design (Chung Man Yee, Dora Ng) * Won: Best Original Film Score (Peter Kam, Leon Ko) * Won: Best Original Film Song (Peter Kam, Jacky Cheung) * Nominated: Best Picture * Nominated: Best Director (Peter Chan) * Nominated: Best Film Editing (Wenders Li, Chi-Leung Kwong) * Nominated: Best Screenplay (Oi Wah Lam, Raymond To) * Nominated: Best Sound Design (Kinson Tsang) =43rd Golden Horse Awards= * Won: Best Actress (Zhou Xun) * Won: Best Cinematography (Peter Pau) * Won: Best Director (Peter Chan)''' * Won: Best Original Film Song (Leon Ko-song:Crossroad) * Nominated: Best Film * Nominated: Best Action Choreography (Wei Tung, Farah Khan) * Nominated: Best Art Direction (Chung Man Yee, Pater Wong) * Nominated: Best Film Editing (Wenders Li, Chi-Leung Kwong) * Nominated: Best Makeup & Costume Design (Chung Man Yee) * Nominated: Best Original Film Score (Peter Kam, Leon Ko) * Nominated: Best Sound Effects (Kinson Tsang) * Nominated: Best Visual Effects (Siu Lun Ho, Pornpol Sakarin)  References  External links * * Article in The Star * Review Category:2000s musical films Category:2005 films Category:Chinese films Category:Chinese romantic drama films Category:Chinese musical films Category:Cantonese-language films Category:Hong Kong films Category:Films directed by Peter Chan Category:Films set in Beijing Category:Films set in the 1990s Category:Films set in Shanghai Category:Mandarin-language films Category:Films whose director won the Best Director Golden Horse Award ","title":"Perhaps Love (2005 film)"},{"id":"3659083","text":"Juan Manuel Sucre Figarella (1925-1996), was a Venezuelan Army Brigadier General who served as Chief of Staff of the Venezuelan army in the 1970s during the administration of President Rafael Caldera. He is a member of the Sucre family and a direct descendant of Vicente Vitto Luis Ram√≥n de Sucre Pardo y Garc√≠a de Urbaneja, the father of the War of Independence hero Antonio Jos√© de Sucre. Family and Early Life Born in Tumeremo, Bol√≠var state in Venezuela in 1925 he was orphaned at a young age and left to do a lot of the upbringing of his younger siblings Leopoldo, Ines Matilde, Antonio, Jose Francisco and Guillermo. All the siblings would go on to achieve great things in their lifetimes, in the field of politics, arts and medicine. Military career General Sucre graduated from the Academia Militar de Venezuela and went on to complete high military degrees in different areas in Brazil's Escola Superior de Guerra and in the United States. General Sucre went on to serve as a part of the United Nations's peacemaking forces (the famous Blue Helmets) in India in the 1960s during conflicts with Pakistan. General Sucre's military career reached a high point when President Caldera named him Jefe de la Casa Militar (Chief of the Military House) which placed General Sucre at the head of all presidential security needs and procedures. Their relationship was a very close one and they remained very close friends for the rest of their lives, bringing together both families as their wives, Alicia Pietri de Caldera and Gisela Garcia de Sucre, also became great friends. During his time as Chief, Sucre had to deal with sporadic but important guerilla movements all over the nation that threatened the stability of the emerging democratic movement. In February 1974, the last year of Caldera's presidency, Sucre was named Chief of Staff of the Army, the highest office in the Venezuelan Army. He remained in the post till April 1975. As Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez, a member of Caldera's COPEI's main rival, Accion Democratica, took the office of President, he replaced Sucre Figarella with Manuel Bereciartu. Post-Military Life After achieving the highest office in his career, General Sucre decided to retire soon after his replacement was put in place. He served as President of Seguros Horizontes, a branch of the Army in charge of providing insurance to officers and others. Later he would serve as President of the supermarket chain Cada and as Vice President of Operations and Security for Banco del Orinoco until the time of his death in 1996. Personal life Sucre married Gisela Garc√≠a Gruber, a first cousin of diplomat Juan Garcia Gruber, in the 1940s, and fathered eight children. He was a devout Catholic and a member of the Salesian Order of the Roman Catholic Church. He died due to pancreas cancer on August 26, 1996. President Caldera would perhaps best sum up his life with his phrase uttered to Sucre Figarella in the 1970s when he said, \\"General Sucre, you are the General Sucre of the 20th Century\\", meaning that he was the natural heir to the great Venezuelan hero - and his relative - General Antonio Jos√© de Sucre  See also  *List of Venezuelans References Category:People from Bol√≠var (state) Category:1925 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Venezuelan soldiers ","title":"Juan Manuel Sucre Figarella"},{"id":"3659090","text":"Adam Mair (born February 15, 1979) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Toronto Maple Leafs, Los Angeles Kings, Buffalo Sabres and the New Jersey Devils. He is currently a player development coach for the Buffalo Sabres. Playing career Mair was drafted 84th overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft. He joined the Maple Leafs for five games in the 1999 Stanley Cup Playoffs, recording a goal and 14 penalty minutes. However, he spent the majority of the 1999‚Äì2000 season in the AHL with the St. John's Maple Leafs. The Leafs traded Mair at the Trade Deadline in 2001, acquiring defenseman Aki Berg from the Los Angeles Kings. Mair split time in the 2001‚Äì02 season between the AHL and NHL, and was hurt for a good amount of the season. In a December 20, 2001 game against the Ottawa Senators, Mair was assessed 47 penalty minutes after he left the Kings bench to join a fight that had broken out between the two teams behind Kings goaltender Felix Potvin. As the two teams fought, Mair's teammate Mikko Eloranta squared off with Senator's enforcer Chris Neil. Seeing that Eloranta was at an obvious disadvantage, Mair left the Kings bench and tackled Neil. The next day it was announced that Mair had received an automatic 10-game suspension for leaving the bench to join a fight. The Kings decided to trade Mair to the Buffalo Sabres on July 24, in exchange for former first round draft pick Erik Rasmussen. Mair has become a popular player, with his effort and his aggression. He set a personal high in games played and assists and tied a personal record in goals in 2003‚Äì04. His 2005‚Äì06 season was plagued by concussions. He missed a total of 31 regular season games due to concussion symptoms after a collision with Tyson Nash of the Phoenix Coyotes on January 12, 2006. He missed the remainder of the 2006 regular season and the first 2 rounds of the playoffs and did not appear for his first playoff game until game five of the third round versus the Carolina Hurricanes. Adam was named an alternate captain on February 4, 2008 under the Sabres 2007‚Äì08 rotating captains and alternate captains system. On November 9, 2009 the Buffalo Sabres placed Adam Mair on waivers. The 24-hour deadline passed with no team claiming Mair. The Sabres did have the option of sending him to the AHL Portland Pirates, but head coach Lindy Ruff decided to keep him up with the Sabres instead. On September 17, 2010, Mair was invited by the New Jersey Devils on a tryout contract for the team, he eventually signed with New Jersey on October 12, 2010. After his final professional season with the Springfield Falcons of the AHL in 2011‚Äì12, Mair announced his retirement and accepted the role of Director of Player Development at Canisius College on October 22, 2012. On June 17, 2015, Mair was hired by the Buffalo Sabres as a player development coach.

On the accession of the latter to the throne, he was appointed treasurer to Queen Charlotte, and attaching himself to Lord Bute he became an influential member of the party known as The King's Friends, whose meetings were frequently held at his house. He promoted the preferment of his brother George, who went to Ireland as chaplain to the Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset.

In the Cup'ig language it is known as Cing'ig (\\"point\\", as in point of land). According to Donald Orth (1967, Dictionary of Alaska Place Names) the name marks the southwest entrance point to Etolin Strait. According to local usage the feature is misnamed on official United States Geological Survey maps. Since the name was reported to USGS by the USCGS in \\"about 1908\\" (the Board of Geographic Names decision was in 1906, and Baker reports USCGS began using it in 1899) it may have subsequently migrated to the next northernmost point of land, Cing'ig. The 1911 USCGS chart does not accurately represent the shape of the coast here; the point and the cape are not separately identifiable. The USGS lists Atahgo Point, Valilief Cape, and Chingeleth Point as alternative names for Cape Corwin; Atahgo point also has its own listing with distinct coordinates.United States Geological Survey Geographic names identification system Cape Corwin may have been named for USRC Corwin Baker, Marcus (1906) \\"Geographic dictionary of Alaska, ed 2\\" United States Geological Survey Bulletin 299 which patrolled the Bering Sea in the 1880s and 1890s and made systematic depth soundings around Nunivak Island in 1899USCGS (1900).

It was designated as a Category A listed building in 1971. History The estate was granted to Colin Campbell, 6th Laird of Glenorchy in 1547 by Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven and his son, 'Black' Sir Duncan Campbell, 1st Baronet of Glenorchy, (Donnchadh Dubh) probably built the castle in 1584. Description The castle takes the form of a Z-plan tower house and most likely incorporates an earlier tower in its eastern side. The rectangular main block measures and is three storeys and an attic high. Circular bartizans are corbelled out at the north and south corners at the second-storey level. Four-storey round towers, roughly in diameter, are at the northwestern and southeastern corners. Circular stair towers are corbelled out at the first-storey level at the northern junctures with the main block. The interior and the roofs were remodelled around 1790. Sometime during the 18th or 19th centuries a two- storey porch and stairway was built against the northern face of the castle. A single-storey U-plan corrugated-iron structure was erected in 1870 on the eastern side, probably as an office. In the early 20th century a five-storey addition was built, completely enclosing the southeastern tower. The castle fell into a state of dereliction by the 1960s, but it was renovated for use as a private family home from about 1968‚Äì1998 by a series of owners. As part of the remodelling, all of the external additions, except for the office, were demolished.
