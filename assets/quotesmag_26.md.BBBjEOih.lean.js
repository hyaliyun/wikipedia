It has several islands, the largest of them being Johns Island, which is long and less than wide, also extending in a southwest- northeast direction like the lake itself. Other islands include Gatter Island, Clay Island (both close to the northeastern shore), Whisler Island, and Dyas Island (both close to the southern shore). The lake is covered by ice about ten months a year. It is fed by glaciers (most importantly Henrietta Nesmith and the Gilmour Glaciers) from the surrounding Eureka Uplands‚ÄîPalaeozoic rocks north of the lake, rising up to above sea level‚Äîand drained by long Ruggles River, which flows into Chandler Fjord on the northern east coast of Ellesmere Land. The lake is flanked by the Arctic Cordillera. The area around the lake is a thermal oasis within a polar desert, with summer temperatures up to . The lake is part of Quttinirpaaq National Park. Artifacts of Thule civilization were discovered near Lake Hazen in 2004. Thule preceded the Inuit. In 1882, Adolphus Greely discovered the lake during his 1881‚Äì1883 expedition. Greely's base camp for the exploration was Fort Conger at the northeastern shore of Ellesmere Island, at , which was established as part of the first International Polar Year. Greely named the lake in honour of General William Babcock Hazen, who had organized the expedition. Camp Hazen was established on the northern shore of the lake in 1957 during the International Geophysical Year (IGY), and has been used by various scientific parties since then. Lake Hazen is populated by two morphotypes of Arctic char, a larger and a smaller. Studies in the 1990s indicated neither char morphotype is anadromous, but Inuit traditional knowledge states otherwise.Douglas Clark, ‚ÄúAssessing the Health of the Lake Hazen Ecosystem, Ellesmere Island, Northwest Territories,‚Äù Parks Canada, 1997. Archived from the original on 2007-09-28. Retrieved 2020-05-14. ‚ÄúTwo morphotypes of Arctic char are present in Lake Hazen: a large, cannibalistic form, and a small, presumably benthic-feeding form (Reist et al. 1995). Taken together, the results of both radiotelemetry studies in 1995‚Äì6 (Babaluk et al. in prep.) and, more conclusively, strontium uptake by char (Halden et al. 1996) suggest that neither form is anadromous. However, this is in contradiction to Inuit traditional knowledge, which holds that the char in Lake Hazen do go to sea (Ellesmere Island National Park Reserve Advisory Board, March 5, 1997). A comprehensive demographic analysis of the char population of Lake Hazen is in progress (J. Reist, pers. comm.).

Mere deposition of fat in the liver is termed steatosis, and together these constitute fatty liver changes. There are two main types of fatty liver disease: alcohol-related fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Risk factors for NAFLD include diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome. When inflammation is present it is referred to as alcoholic steatohepatitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Steatohepatitis of either cause may progress to cirrhosis, and NASH is now believed to be a frequent cause of unexplained cirrhosis (at least in Western societies). NASH is also associated with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency. The word is from steato-, meaning \\"fat\\" and hepatitis, meaning \\"inflammation of the liver\\". Alcoholic steatohepatitis Chronic alcohol intake commonly causes steatohepatitis. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is fatty liver disease due to causes other than alcohol. No pharmacological treatment has received approval as of 2015 for NASH. Some studies suggest diet, exercise, and antiglycemic drugs may alter the course of the disease. General recommendations include improving metabolic risk factors and reducing alcohol intake. NASH was first described in 1980 in a series of patients of the Mayo Clinic. Its relevance and high prevalence were recognized mainly in the 1990s. Some think NASH is a diagnosis of exclusion, and many cases may in fact be due to other causes.

It is the IPv6 equivalent of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4. IPv6 hosts may automatically generate IP addresses internally using stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC), or they may be assigned configuration data with DHCPv6. IPv6 hosts that use stateless autoconfiguration may require information other than an IP address or route. DHCPv6 can be used to acquire this information, even though it is not being used to configure IP addresses. DHCPv6 is not necessary for configuring hosts with the addresses of Domain Name System (DNS) servers, because they can be configured using Neighbor Discovery Protocol, which is also the mechanism for stateless autoconfiguration.RFC 4339, IPv6 Host Configuration of DNS Server Information Approaches, J. Jeong (February 2006) Many IPv6 routers, such as routers for residential networks, must be configured automatically with no operator intervention. Such routers require not only an IPv6 address for use in communicating with upstream routers, but also an IPv6 prefix for use in configuring devices on the downstream side of the router. DHCPv6 prefix delegation provides a mechanism for configuring such routers. Operation Port numbers DHCPv6 uses UDP port number 546 for clients and port number 547 for servers. Identifiers =DHCP unique identifier= The DHCP unique identifier (DUID) is used by a client to get an IP address from a DHCPv6 server. It has a 2-byte DUID type field, and a variable-length identifier field up to 128 bytes. Its actual length depends on its type. The server compares the DUID with its database and delivers configuration data (address, lease times, DNS servers, etc.) to the client. The first 16 bits of a DUID contain the DUID type, of which there are four types. The meaning of the remaining DUID depends on the type. Four types are identified in RFC 8415: * Link-layer address plus time (DUID-LLT) * Vendor-assigned unique ID based on enterprise number (DUID-EN) * Link-layer address (DUID-LL) * UUID-based DUID (DUID-UUID) =RFC 6939: Client Link-Layer Address Option= Due to the fact that it is difficult to manage multiple identifiers in a dual-stack environment, and the fact that DUIDs are simply not optimal for some situations, RFC 6939 was released, giving a way to identify a host based on its MAC address. It defines a way for a DHCPv6 relay to pass that information to a DHCPv6 server. Example In this example, without rapid-commit present, the server's link-local address is fe80::0011:22ff:fe33:5566 and the client's link-local address is fe80::aabb:ccff:fedd:eeff. * Client sends a solicit from [fe80::aabb:ccff:fedd:eeff]:546 to [ff02::1:2]:547.

NY Times, May 4, 1993.) was a Vietnamese philosopher. His work (written primarily in French) attempted to unite phenomenology with Marxist philosophy. His work had some currency in France in the 1950s and 1960s, and was cited favorably by Jacques Derrida, Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard and Louis Althusser. Life Studies in France Tr·∫ßn ƒê·ª©c Th·∫£o was born in Hanoi, French Indochina, he was educated there, completing his baccalaureate at 17. In 1936, he continued his studies in France, becoming a student of Maurice Merleau-Ponty at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure where he wrote a dissertation for a dipl√¥me d‚Äô√©tudes sup√©rieures on Hegel. In 1943, he completed his agr√©gation with a thesis on the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl, being received premier ex aequo alongside Jules Vuillemin. Through the 1940s, he worked on his first book, Phenomenology and Dialectical Materialism. The book argued that the defects of the phenomenological account of consciousness could only be remedied by the Marxist account of labor and society. In the 1940s and 50s, Tr·∫ßn ƒê·ª©c Th·∫£o‚Äôs ideas achieved some currency among the elite philosophical circles of France. At the same time, he became an active anti- colonialist, publishing articles in Jean-Paul Sartre and Merleau-Ponty‚Äôs journal Les Temps modernes about colonialism in Indochina; these articles were read by Frantz Fanon and other anticolonialists. From October to December 1945, Tr·∫ßn ƒê·ª©c Th·∫£o was jailed by the French government as a threat to its security. Return to Vietnam, 1951 Phenomenology and Dialectical Materialism was published in 1951, and in the same year he returned to Vietnam, working in support of the Communist Party. In 1956, he was named the Dean of History in the country‚Äôs first national university. But he became critical of the Party over land reforms which had led to many deaths in 1956, and Tr·∫ßn ƒê·ª©c Th·∫£o was caught up in the Nhan Van-Giai Pham affair in which the dissident intellectuals of the late 1950s were publicly criticized or punished. Though Tran Duc Thao was never jailed, he fell out of favor with the ruling Party, publishing two self-criticisms in Nh√¢n D√¢n and leaving his position of authority in 1958.

This book, published in France in 1973, combined materialist biological and cognitive accounts of subjectivity and consciousness with the Marxist account he had elaborated earlier. In the liberalized political climate of the 1980s, he was able to return to France for medical treatment, and there he met many of his old philosophical colleagues again, although he lived in poverty in an apartment at the Vietnamese embassy.

Taxonomy Previously, this species was a member of the genus Cichlasoma and the subgeneric section Nandopsis. However, the genus Cichlasoma is in revision and has been restricted to the 12 species of South American cichlids related to Cichlasoma bimaculatum. Thus, many of the approximately 100 species that were formerly members of Cichlasoma have yet to be formally assigned to a new genus. Distribution This species can be found in Middle America. It is native to the Atlantic slope of tropical Mesoamerica, ranging from eastern Mexico southward to Nicaragua.Miller, R.R. (1966): Geographical Distribution of Central American Freshwater Fishes. Copeia, 1966 (4): 773-802. It was first recorded from Everglades National Park, Florida in 1983 and is now a common nonindigenous fish in South Florida.Bergmann, G.T. & Motta, P.J.

Environmental Biology of Fishes, 72 (2): 205-211. Habitat The Mayan cichlid inhabits freshwater marshes, mangrove swamps, lakes, rivers, rocky shorelines, lagoons, estuaries and coastal islands. Adults prefer coastal lagoons and rivers and may survive in marine conditions. It can be found in oxygen-rich areas near submerged vegetation and over muddy substrates. However, despite its preference for waters with dissolved oxygen content of at least 3.5 mg/L, it is capable of surviving in extreme hypoxia. This is because it is an oxygen conformer, becoming much less active in hypoxic water, and even surviving virtual anoxia for up to two hours. Unusually, this fish has been recorded in some cenotes in the Yucatan Peninsula. Mayaheros urophthalmus in Everglades. Video clip Description Mayaheros urophthalmus reaches a maximum length of 39.4 cm. This fish is one of the larger cichlids. The body is oval and flattened on the sides and the head is tapering towards the mouth. Fins are spiny. It has a base color of yellow-brown to gray-brown in most cases, that becomes intense red during breeding. The head and throat are reddish, especially in younger fish. The caudal fin and the soft-sections of the dorsal and anal fin are usually more or less reddish. Six wide green-black vertical stripes run across the sides of the body between the base of the pectoral fin and the base of the caudal fin. There is a large black eye spot circled with blue-green on the tail stem (hence the species scientific name urophthalmus (from oura, Greek for tail and ophthalmos, Greek for eye).Florida Museum Since the distribution area of the species is relatively large, this species may occurs in different colors, which may differ from the one described above. Human relevance Mayaheros urophthalmus with Hypostomus plecostomus. In its native range, the Mayan cichlid is a popular food fish. For this reason it is the basis of a regional fishery, is commonly used in aquaculture. As in many animals, the red color is much more brilliant in wild specimens than captive ones, but one can help maintain some of its vibrance by feeding the fish live foods and foods that contain Vitamin A, which breaks down into the red pigment beta-carotene in the body. It is among the most-studied of the Neotropical cichlids.Mart√≠nez-Palacios, C.A., Ch√°vez-S√°nchez, C. & Olvera Novoa, M.A. (1993): The potential for culture of the American Cichlidae with emphasis on Cichlasoma urophthalmus. In: Muir, J.F. & Roberts, R.J. (Eds.), Recent advances in aquaculture. Vol. 4., Blackwell, Oxford, England. To date, the Mayan cichlid has been most intensively studied at localities in southeastern Mexico on or near the Yucatan Peninsula.Gamboa-P√©rez, H.C. & Schmitter-Soto, J.J. (1999): Distribution of cichlid fishes in the littoral of Lake Bacalar, Yucatan Peninsula. Environmental Biology of Fishes, 54 (1): 35-43. Biology The Mayan cichlid is philopatric, or site tenacious, i.e. - individuals are non-migratory and prefer to stay within a home range.Faunce, C.H. & Lorenz, J.J. 2000. Reproductive Biology of the Introduced Mayan cichlid, Cichlasoma urophthalmus, Within an Estuarine Mangrove Habitat of Southern Florida. Environmental Biology of Fishes, 58 (2): 215-225. The Mayan cichlid has a minimum temperature requirement of about 14 degrees Celsius.Stauffer, J.R.Jr. & Boltz, S.E. (1994): Effect of Salinity on the Temperature Preference and Tolerance of Age-0 Mayan Cichlids. Transactions of the American Fisheries Society, 123 (1): 101-107. In its native range, it inhabits waters with temperatures from 18 - 34 degrees Celsius, but its optimal temperature range is 28 - 33 degrees Celsius.Martinez-Palacios, C.A., Chavez-Sanchez, M.C. & Ross, L.G. (1996): The effects of water temperature on food intake, growth and body composition of Cichlasoma urophthalmus (G√ºnther) juveniles. Aquaculture Research, 27 (6): 455-461. The Mayan cichlid is capable of surviving in a variety of conditions. It is euryhaline and can survive in a range of salinity from 0 - 40 ppt. Experiments on captive specimens have shown that it can tolerate abrupt increases in salinity of up to 15 ppt.Martinez-Palacios, C.A., Ross, L.G. & Rosado-Vallado, M. (1990): The effects of salinity on the survival and growth of juvenile Cichlasoma urophthalmus. Aquaculture, 91 (1-2): 65-75. The Mayan cichlid has a broad range of tolerance to abiotic conditions and a broad functional repertoire to enable it to feed on about 20% of evasive prey due to its 6.8% jaw protrusion while feeding.Hulsey, C.D. & Garc√≠a de Le√≥n, F.J. (2005): Cichlid jaw mechanics: linking morphology to feeding specialization. Functional Ecology, 19 (3): 487-494. This species is also a dietary generalist, consuming organisms from a variety of disparate taxa.Martinez-Palacios, C.A. & Ross, L.G. (1988): The feeding ecology of the Central American cichlid Cichlasoma urophthalmus (Gunther). Journal of Fish Biology, 33 (5): 665-670. However, it is susceptible to malnourishment, apparently due to the requirement that a relatively large proportion of its diet be animal prey. The Mayan cichlid's diet includes plant matter, smaller fish, algae, detritus, snails, crustaceans and insects.https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10641-004-1480-1https://www.seriouslyfish.com/species/cichlasoma- urophthalmus/#diet Reproduction The Mayan cichlid is territorial and aggressive when breeding. As parents, Mayan cichlids are highly protective of their young, and they have several broods per year. This species is a monogamous, biparental substrate spawner that exhibits minimal sexual dimorphism and guards its fry for up to six weeks. All of these traits are greatly developed and represent an extreme in the general pattern found in the genus Mayaheros. In Mexico, the Mayan cichlid spawns for a nine-month period from March to November, particularly during the wet season from June to September. This corresponds to a period when the water temperature is at least 24 degrees Celsius. Multiple broods are raised per year. The fry appear to be adapted to lotic water. They exhibit strongly positive geotactic behavior, actively swimming down to the substrate upon hatching from the egg and adhering themselves to the bottom by means of three pairs of mucous glands.

Chief American Horse was a son of Old Chief Smoke. Old Chief Smoke was an Oglala Lakota head chief and one of the last great Shirt Wearers, a highly prestigious Lakota warrior society. The Smoke People were one of the most prominent Lakota families of the 18th and 19th centuries. Old Chief Smoke was one of the first Lakota chiefs to appreciate the power of the whites, their overwhelming numbers and the futility of war. He appreciated the need for association and learned the customs of the whites. Old Chief Smoke had five wives and many children.Old Chief Smoke's five wives were Looking Cloud Woman of the Teton Mnik»ü√≥wo≈æu, Comes Out Slow Woman of the Teton Ogl√°la, Burnt Her Woman of the Teton Siƒçh√°≈ã«ßu, Yellow Haired Woman of the Southern Cheyenne, and Brown Eyes Woman of the Teton H√∫≈ãkpap»üa. Old Chief Smoke's sons carried the Smoke People legacy of leadership in Oglala Lakota culture into the early 20th century. The children of Old Chief Smoke were Spotted Horse Woman, Chief Big Mouth (1822-1869), Chief Blue Horse (1822-1908), Chief Red Cloud (1822-1909), Chief American Horse (1830-1876), Chief Bull Bear III, Chief Solomon Smoke II, Chief No Neck and Woman Dress (1846-1920).Red Cloud was adopted by Old Chief Smoke, his maternal uncle, around 1825 at the age of three after Red Cloud's parents died.

On August 26, 1876, with his men rationed for fifteen days, a determined General Crook departed from the Powder River and headed east toward the Little Missouri pursuing the Indians. Crook feared that Indians would scatter to seek game rather than meet the soldiers in combat after the fight with Custer. All other commanders had withdrawn from pursuit, but Crook resolved to teach the Indians a lesson. He meant to show that neither distance, bad weather, the loss of horses nor the absence of rations could deter the U.S. Army from following its enemies to the bitter end.Greene, p. 26, 31, 114-115.

Greene, p.73.  Chief American Horse's Defiance  On September 9, 1876, Chief American Horse's village at Slim Buttes was assaulted in a dawn attack by Captain Anson Mills and 150 troopers. At the onset of a stampede of Indian ponies and cavalry charge, Chief American Horse with his family of three warriors and about twenty-five women and children retreated into one of the ravines that crisscrossed the village amongst the tipis. The winding dry gully was nearly 20 feet deep and ran some 200 yards back into a hillside. Trees and brush obstructed the view of the interior. \\"We found that some of the Indians had got into a cave at one side of the village. One of the men started to go past that spot on the hill, and as he passed the place he and his horse were both shot. This cave or dugout was down in the bed of a dry creek. The Indian children had been playing there, and dug quite a hole in the bank, so that it made more of a cave than anything else, large enough to hold a number of people.\\" Grouard, p. 307. Troopers were alerted about the ravine when Private John Wenzel, Company A, Third Cavalry, became the first army fatality at Slim Buttes when he ill-advisedly approached the ravine from the front and a Sioux bullet slammed into his forehead. Wenzel's horse was also shot and killed. An attempt was made to dislodge the Indians and several troopers were wounded.Greene, p.66. \\"Anson Mills\\", p.430. \\"Grouard and Big Bat Pourier crept close enough to the banks of the ravine to parley with the concealed Indians in endeavors to get them to surrender. But the savages were so confident of succor from Crazy Horse and his much larger force, who were encamped only a dozen miles to the west, and to whom they had sent runners early in the morning, that they were defiant to the last.\\" The Sioux felt no urgent need to surrender, for they defiantly yelled over to the soldiers that more Sioux camps were at hand and their warriors would soon come to free them. Chief American Horse, anticipating relief from other villages, constructed a dirt breastworks in front of the cave and geared for a stout defense.Robert E.

He worked futilely to save the life of Chief American Horse. On September 9, 1876, General Crook's relief column endured a forced march of twenty-miles to Slim Buttes in about four and a half hours, arriving at 11:30 a.m. The whole cheering command entered the valley, and the village teemed with activity like an anthill which had just been stirred up.Anson Mills, \\"My Story,\\" (hereinafter \\"Anson Mills\\")(1918), p.430. Finerty, p.70, 253. Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 203. Greene, p.71. Crook immediately established his headquarters and set up a field hospital in one of the Indian lodges.Doctors deliberated amputating Lt. Von Luettwitz's right leg. Crook inventoried the camp and the booty. The camp held thirty-seven lodges. A three- or four-year-old girl was discovered, but no bodies were found. Over 5,000 pounds of dried meat was found and was a \\"God-send\\" for the starved troopers.\\"Greene, p.72. Troopers separated the stores to be saved from the greater number to be destroyed, and the remaining tipis were pulled down. General Crook then turned his full attention to Chief American Horse and his family in the ravine.While General Crook had been an adversary in the field of combat, he had also been a man of honor and an advocate for Indians.\\"The fact is, Crook is nothing but an Indian...I mean that his mind, physiognomy and education are all Indian. Look at his face,...[the] high cheek bones [and] the contour of his skull; and his manners --stolid, separate, averse to talk. He can take his gun and cross then desert, subsisting on the way where you or i would starve. Perfectly self-reliant for any venture, delighted with lonely travel and personal hazard, carrying nothing but his arms, he will walk after a trial all day and night when night comes, no matter how cold, he wraps himself in an Indian blanket, humped up in Indian fashion, and pitches himself into a sage brush, there to be perfectly easy till morning. He will follow an antelope for three days. He requires nothing to drink or smoke, and very little to eat. Abstemious, singular [sic] utterly ignorant of fear, and yet stealthy as a cat, shy of women and strangers; and when he was a cadet he had all the same traits.\\" Greene, p. 17, citing Inyo Independent (Independence, Calf.), September 2, 1871. \\"In spite of previous broken treaties, many Lakota trusted and respected Crook. While he had been an adversary in the field of combat, he had also been a man of honor. A majority listened when the general told them, It is certain you will never get any better terms than offered in this bill, and the chances are you will not get so good. He at least never lied to us.\\" William S.E. Coleman, \\"Voices of Wounded Knee,\\"(2000), p. 22. \\"Crook, exasperated by the protracted defense of the hidden Sioux, and annoyed at the casualties inflicted among his men, formed a perfect cordon of infantry and dismounted cavalry around the Indian den. The soldiers opened upon it an incessant fire, which made the surrounding hills echo back a terrible music.\\" Finerty, p.254. \\"The circumvalleted Indians distributed their shots liberally among the crowding soldiers, but the shower of close-range bullets from the later terrified the unhappy squaws, and they began singing the awful Indian death chant. The papooses wailed so loudly, and so piteously, that even not firing could not quell their voices. General Crook ordered the men to suspend operations immediately, but dozens of angry soldiers surged forward and had to be beat back by officers. \\"Neither General Crook nor any of his officers or men suspected that any women and children were in the gully until their cries were heard above the volume of fire poured upon the fatal spot.\\" Finerty, p.257 Grouard and Pourier, who spoke Lakota, were ordered by General Crook to offer the women and children quarter. This was accepted by the besieged, and Crook in person went into the mouth of the ravine and handed out one tall, fine looking woman, who had an infant strapped to her back. She trembled all over and refused to liberate the General's hand. Eleven other squaws and six papooses were taken out and crowded around Crook, but the few surviving warriors refused to surrender and savagely re-commenced the fight.  \\"Rain of Hell\\"  Chief American Horse refused to leave, and with three warriors, five women and an infant, remained in the cave. Exasperated by the increasing casualties in his ranks, Crook directed some of his infantry and dismounted cavalry to form across the opening of the gorge. On command, the troopers opened steady and withering fire on the ravine which sent an estimated 3,000 bullets among the warriors.Greene, p. 77. Finerty reported, \\"Then our troops reopened with a very 'rain of hell' upon the infatuated braves, who, nevertheless, fought it out with Spartan courage, against such desperate odds, for nearly two hours. \\"Such matchless bravery electrified even our enraged soldiers into a spirit of chivalry, and General Crook, recognizing the fact that the unfortunate savages had fought like fiends, in defense of wives and children, ordered another suspension of hostilities and called upon the dusky heroes to surrender.\\" Strahorn recalled the horror of the ravine at Slim Buttes. \\"The yelling of Indians, discharge of guns, cursing of soldiers, crying of children, barking of dogs, the dead crowded in the bottom of the gory, slimy ditch, and the shrieks of the wounded, presented the most agonizing scene that clings in my memory of Sioux warfare.\\" Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 204.  Surrender of Chief American Horse  When matters quieted down, Frank Grouard and Baptiste ‚ÄúBig Bat‚Äù Pourier asked American Horse again if they would come out of the hole before any more were shot, telling them they would be safe if they surrendered. \\"After a few minutes deliberation, the chief, American Horse, a fine looking, broad-chested Sioux, with a handsome face and a neck like a bull, showed himself at the mouth of the cave, presenting the butt end of his rifle toward the General.Finerty, p.255. He had just been shot in the abdomen, and said in his native language, that he would yield if the lives of the warriors who fought with him were spared. Chief American Horse had been shot through the bowels and was holding his entrails in his hands as he came out and presented the butt end of his rifle to General Crook. Pourier recalled that he first saw American Horse kneeling with a gun in his hand, in a hole on the side of the ravine that he had scooped out with a butcher knife. Two of the squaws were also wounded. Eleven were killed in the hole.Greene, p.168. Grouard, p. 311. Grouard recognized Chief American Horse, \\"but you would not have thought he was shot from his appearance and his looks, except for the paleness of his face. He came marching out of that death trap as straight as an arrow. Holding out one of his blood-stained hands he shook hands with me.\\" Grouard, p. 310-311. When Chief American Horse presented the butt end of his rifle, General Crook, who took the proffered rifle, instructed Grouard to ask his name. The Indian replied in Lakota, \\"American Horse.\\" Some of the soldiers who lost their comrades in the skirmish shouted, \\"No quarter!', but not a man was base enough to attempt shooting down the disabled chief. Crook hesitated for a minute and then said,'Two or three Sioux, more or less, can make no difference. I can yet use them to good advantage. \\"Tell the chief,\\" he said turning to Grouard, \\"that neither he nor his young men will be harmed further.\\" \\"This message having been interpreted to Chief American Horse, he beckoned to his surviving followers, and two strapping Indians, with their long, but quick and graceful stride, followed him out of the gully. The chieftain's intestines protruded from his wound, but a squaw, his wife perhaps, tied her shawl around the injured part, and then the poor, fearless savage, never uttering a complaint, walked slowly to a little camp fire, occupied by his people about 20 yards away, and sat down among the women and children.\\"  Crazy Horse Attacks  Crazy Horse attempted to rescue American Horse and his family. Indians who escaped Mills' early morning assault spread the word to nearby Lakota and Cheyenne camps, and informed Crazy Horse, Sitting Bull and other leaders they were attacked by 100-150 soldiers. Crazy Horse immediately assembled 600-800 warriors and rode about ten miles northward to rescue Chief American Horse and recover ponies and supplies.\\"I have heard the number of Sioux variously estimated, but I cannot presume to verify any of the estimates made. There could not, in my opinion, have been more than six to eight hundred of their fighting men opposed to us.\\" Finerty, p.264. During the afternoon Chief American Horse and some of the squaws informed Gen. Crook, through the scouts, that Crazy Horse was not far off, and that we would certainly be attacked before nightfall.Finerty, p.259. \\"In anticipation of that afternoon tea party which was promised to be given by Crazy Horse, Crook deployed his forces to give that chieftain the surprise of his life. Concealing the major portion in the ravine in up-to-the-minute readiness and eagerness for an attack, he deployed just enough of the boys in plain sight to carry out the impression, which the Indian couriers had conveyed to Crazy Horse, that only about a hundred soldiers would be found to oppose his eager and confident large reinforcements.\\" Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 204-205. As a grave was being dug for Private Wenzel, and the starved troopers were ready to dine on captured bison meat, rifle shots were heard from the bluffs above and around the camp.Finerty, p.260, Greene, p.81. Crook immediately ordered the village to be burned. \\"Then followed the most spectacular and tragically gripping and gratifying drama of the whole Sioux War, enacted with a setting and view for those of us in the ambushing corps that could not be improved upon. The huge amphitheater, leading from our position in the front orchestra row, up over a gradually rising terrain to the rim of the hills which surrounded on three sides, was not unlike the situation which Crazy Horse had chosen for his Battle of the Rosebud.\\" Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 205. Finerty tells how the Indians attacked. \\"Like the Napoleonic cuirassiers at Waterloo, they rode along the line looking for a gap to penetrate. They kept up perpetual motion encouraged by a warrior, doubtless Crazy Horse himself, who, mounted on a fleet, white horse, galloped around the array and seemed to possess the power of ubiquity.\\" Finerty, p.263. Vestal, p.187. Strahorn reported, \\"Suddenly the summits seemed alive with an eager, expectant and gloating host of savages who dashed over and down the slope, whooping and recklessly firing at every jump.\\" Crazy Horse was surprised to find American Horse's village massed with Crook's main column of over 2,000 infantry, artillery, cavalry and scouts.\\"The Indians had made their charge with the expectation of finding only a small body of troops, as had been reported to them by the Indians who had escaped from the village. I could tell pretty well from the way they charged down from all directions at once that they never expected to find such a large body of troops, and it gave them quite a surprise to find we were ready for them. It was not more than ten minutes before the fight became general all around the camp.\\" Grouard, p. 308. \\"Crazy Horse so little dreamed of the heavy reinforcements of Captain Mills' small band that, in the utmost confidence of 'eating us alive' he launched his followers right down upon the front and flanks of our splendid defensive position. They were permitted to approach with blood curdling whoops and in a savage array within easy and sure-fire rifle range before the order to fire was given. They reacted to the deadly shock in a manner that was the real beginning of the end of the Sioux War, so far as any major performance of Crazy Horse was concerned. Bewildered and demoralized by the well-aimed volleys of our two-thousand guns, they dashed for cover in every direction, closely followed by details of our boys who were allotted that much-sought privilege.\\" Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 205. Strahorn described the encounter: \\"The field could not have been more advantageous for foes, at is speedily occupied rock-covered bluffs commanded all approaches. Yet the one hour's fight that followed was little more than a beautiful; and impressive skirmish drill for our troops, and a very ungraceful flight from all positions by the savages.\\" Greene, p. 87. \\"Failing to break into that formidable circle, the Indians, after firing several volleys, their original order of battle being completely broken, and recognizing the folly of fighting such an outnumbering force any longer, glided away from our front with all possible speed. As the shadows came down into the valley, the last shots were fired and the affair at Slim Buttes was over.\\" Finerty, p.263.  Casualties  Horse drawn stretcher carrying a wounded man from the Battle of Slim Buttes. Captain Mills reported the assault: \\"It is usual for commanding officers to call special attention to acts of distinguished courage, and I trust the extraordinary circumstances of calling on 125 men to attack, in the darkness, and in the wilderness, and on the heels of the late appalling disasters to their comrades, a village of unknown strength, and in the gallant manner in which they executed everything requited of them to my entire satisfaction.\\" \\"Anson Mills\\", p.431. U.S. Army casualties were relatively light with a loss of 30 men: 3 killed, 27 wounded, some seriously.Finerty, p. 263 Because the Lakota and Cheyenne warriors maintained a distance of five to eight hundred yards, and consistently fired their weapons high, casualties were few.Only one soldier was wounded in the advance. Likewise the troops caused little harm to the Indians and found only one casualty. \\"The evening fight at Slim Buttes was not particularly sanguinary, as regarded our side, but it was the prettiest battle scene, so acknowledged to have been seen by men who had witnesses a hundred fights, that ever an Indian war correspondent was called upon to describe.\\" Finerty, p.261. Those who died in the field were Private John Wenzel, Private Edward Kennedy and Scout Charles \\"Buffalo Chips\\" White.\\" Finerty, p. 263. Private Kennedy, Company C, Fifth Cavalry, had half the calf of his leg blown away in a barrage, and throughout the night medical personnel labored to save his life. Private Kennedy and Chief American Horse died in the surgeons' lodge that evening.Greene, p. 90. Lt. Von Luettwitz had his shattered leg amputated above the knee and Private John M. Stevenson of Company I, Second Cavalry, received a severe ankle wound at the ravine. \\"The Indians must have lost quite heavily. Several of their ponies, bridled but riderless, were captured during the evening. Indians never abandon their war ponies, unless they happen to be surprised or killed. Pools of blood were found on the ledges of the bluffs, indicating where Crazy Horse's warriors paid the penalty of their valor with their lives.\\" Finerty, p. 263 Reports of Indian casualties varied, and many bodies were carried away. Sioux confirmed casualties were at least 10 dead, and an unknown number wounded. About 30 Sioux men, women and children were in the ravine with Chief American Horse when the firefight began, and 20 women and children surrendered to Crook.Finerty, p. 263. \\"We secured only seven captives, two buck, four squaws and one little girl.\\" Grouard, p. 311. Ten individuals remained in the ravine during the \\"Rain of Hell\\" and five were killed; Iron Shield, three women, one infant and Chief American Horse who died that evening. The rest were made prisoners.Greene, p.80. Charging Bear resisted most desperately and was finally dragged out of his lair at the bottom of the deep gully with only one cartridge left. Taken prisoner, he soon after enlisted with General Crook, exhibiting great prowess and bravery on behalf of his new leader and against his former comrades.\\" Later served as a corporal in Crook's company of Indian Scouts. Greene, p.168, citing Bourke, \\"Diary,\\" p.877-78. Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 226.  Death of American Horse  American Horse the Younger (above) is notable in American history as a U.S. Army Indian Scout and a progressive Oglala Lakota leader who promoted friendly associations with whites and education for his people. Like his great friend Crazy Horse, there are no known photographs or drawings of Chief American Horse the Elder. Chief American Horse was examined by the two surgeons. One of them pulled the chief's hands away, and the intestines dropped out. \\"Tell him he will die before next morning,\\" said the surgeon.Finerty, p.255-256. The surgeons worked futilely to close his stomach wound, and Chief American Horse refused morphine, preferring to clench a stick between his teeth to hide any sign of pain or emotions, and thus he bravely and stolidly died. Chief American Horse lingered until 6:00 a.m. and confirmed that the tribes were scattering and were becoming discouraged by war. \\"He appeared satisfied that the lives of his squaws and children were spared.\\" Chicago Times, September 17, 1876. Dr. Valentine McGillycuddy, who attended the dying chief, said that he was cheerful to the last and manifested the utmost affection for his wives and children. American Horse's squaws and children were allowed to remain on the battleground after the dusky hero's death, and subsequently fell into the hands of their own people. Even \\"Ute John\\" respected the cold clay of the brave Sioux leader, and his corpse was not subjected to the scalping process.\\" Finerty, p.265. Crook was most gentle in his assurances to all of them that no further harm should come if they went along peacefully, and it only required a day or two of kind treatment to make them feel very much at home.  Two American Horses  There are two Oglala Lakota chiefs named American Horse notable in American history. Historian George E. Hyde distinguished them by referring to \\"Chief American Horse the Elder\\" as the son of Old Chief Smoke and the cousin of Red Cloud, and \\"Chief American Horse the Younger\\" as the son of Sitting Bear, and son-in-law to Red Cloud.George Hyde, Red Cloud's Folk: A History of the Oglala Sioux Indians (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1937), p. 18. American Horse the Younger (1840 ‚Äì December 16, 1908) was an Oglala Lakota chief, statesman, educator and historian. American Horse the Younger is notable in American history as a U.S. Army Indian Scout and a progressive Oglala Lakota leader who promoted friendly associations with whites and education for his people. American Horse the Younger opposed Crazy Horse during the Great Sioux War of 1876-1877 and the Ghost Dance Movement of 1890, and was a Lakota delegate to Washington. American Horse the Younger was one of the first Wild Westers with Buffalo Bill's Wild West and a supporter of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School. \\"His record as a councillor of his people and his policy in the new situation that confronted them was manly and consistent and he was known for his eloquence.\\" American Horse the Younger gained influence during the turbulence of the Great Sioux War of 1876-1877. After news of the death of Chief American Horse the Elder at the Battle of Slim Buttes, Manishnee (Can not walk, or Played out)\\" seized an opportunity and assumed the name \\"American Horse.\\" \\"American Horse liked notoriety and excitement and always seized an opportunity to leap into the center of the arena.\\" Charles A. Eastman (Ohiyesa), \\"Indian Heroes and Great Chieftains\\", (hereinafter \\"Eastman\\")(1919), p. 166. American Horse the Younger was not related to American Horse the Elder, son of Old Chief Smoke. He was the son of Sitting Bear, leader of the True Oglalas, a band of Oglala opposed to the Smoke people Eastman, p. 173. The identities and accounts of American Horse the Elder and the American Horse the Younger have been blended by some historians. Like his great friend Crazy Horse, there are no known photographs or drawings of Chief American Horse the Elder.American Horse the Younger told Eastman that he succeeded to the name and position of his uncle American Horse the Elder who was killed at Sim Buttes in 1876.

She would later discover that he wasn't really her father, but the villainous Mastermind. Lady Mastermind and Mastermind II are her half-sisters. In her original inception, she had short pink hair, pure black eyes and butterfly- like rainbow wings. Pixie (center) and her team After enrolling at Xavier Institute, Pixie is assigned to be part of the Paragons training squad under the tutelage of former New Mutant member Rahne Sinclair. She wears a bicycle helmet during training sessions, due to her uncertainty with flying. During this time, she develops a crush on the X-Man Cyclops and is considered a cheerful girl who fits in well with other students; she was voted Friendliest Student. M-Day Following the events of House of M, almost all of the Institute's students are depowered, which leads to the dissolution of the school's training squad system. Pixie is one of only twenty-seven students, including her fellow Paragons Trance, Wolf Cub, and Match, not to have lost her mutant abilities. She participates in Emma Frost's battle royal which determines who will train to be an X-Man, but does not make the team. She remains at the school, appearing occasionally as a side character. Later, forty-two of Pixie's former classmates are killed when their bus is blown up by a missile sent by William Stryker, an anti-mutant crusader. Among the confirmed deaths are Gwynn's fellow Paragon, DJ.New X-Men #23-24 Quest For Magik Pixie, along with Anole, Loa, Wolf Cub, Rockslide, and Match, are told a frightening ghost story by fellow student Blindfold one night at the school. However, they discover that the story is not fictitious, but rather a prophecy; telling Pixie that she is \\"sorry for [her] loss,\\" Blindfold and her classmates are sucked into the realm of Limbo, where they are immediately attacked by a mob of demons.New X-Men ##37 Pixie stays by Blindfold's side during the fight, and Blindfold cautions Pixie and the others that Pixie must not \\"fall to darkness.\\" Pixie uses her powers on-panel for the first time during the fight, incapacitating several demons with her \\"pixie dust.\\"New X-Men #38 After Darkchilde saves the small group, she asks N'astirh to bring Pixie to her, recognizing that Pixie's soul is the most innocent and therefore the most powerful in Limbo. Despite her friends' pleas, Megan submits to Magik's request to use her soul to create a Soulsword and Bloodstones, magical stones forged from an innocent soul that grant great power to their owners, but is freed from the process by Anole. His intervention saves her, but leaves the spell unfinished, resulting in the creation of only one Bloodstone and a \\"Souldagger\\" instead. Magik then explains that the Souldagger is actually a portion of Pixie's own soul and that black magic has now filled the hole left behind in the knife's creation, leaving Pixie no longer an innocent; this is represented graphically by a great portion of her pink hair changing to black.New X-Men #39 Magik teaches Pixie a teleportation spell and she uses it to teleport herself and her friends to Belasco to prevent him from torturing the rest of the students. Pixie saves the students and ultimately kills Belasco by stabbing him with the Souldagger.New X-Men #40 After defeating Belasco, Magik wants to use more of Pixie's soul to create more Bloodstones to gain more power, but becomes disgusted with herself when her brother calls out to her; she instead sends Pixie and the others back to the Xavier Institute and seals all entrances to Limbo. Pixie and Anole are then made official members of the New X-Men for their bravery in Limbo at the insistence of Rockslide.New X-Men #41 Pixie later reveals that Doctor Strange will tutor her in magic when she comes of age and begins receiving additional training.New X-Men #42New X-Men #43 Messiah Complex When the first new mutant since M-Day appears, Pixie joins X-23, Hellion, Anole, Surge, Armor, and Rockslide in attacking the Washington, D.C. base of the anti-mutant Purifiers by teleporting them there. They are confronted by Lady Deathstrike and the Reavers with Hellion receiving a near mortal injury.New X-Men (2nd series) #44 They are greatly outnumbered; Pixie panics and cannot teleport the team out until Rictor, who infiltrated the Purifiers as a spy, helps her concentrate. Pixie manages to cast a hazardous \\"blind teleport,\\" which scatters the New X-Men between Washington, D.C. and the Xavier InstituteX-Men (2nd Series) #205 The students are then recovered and taken back to the Institute by Iceman, and the wounded sent to the infirmary.Uncanny X-Men #493 However, Predator X later attacks the Institute, going after the weaker, wounded students in the infirmary. Pixie, realizing that X-23 had killed this type of creature before, attempts to teleport Predator X to X-23's location, but mistakenly takes the majority of the students and Beast along with her and the creature, dropping them in the middle of the X-Men's fight for the mutant baby with the Marauders on Muir Island.New X-Men #46 During the fight, Pixie is brutally beaten by the Malice-possessed Omega Sentinel, who taunts Pixie until Megan manages to defeat her by unexpectedly stabbing her with the Souldagger, exorcising Malice from Omega Sentinel's body.X-Men (2nd series) #207 Pixies and Demons In the 2008 Free Comic Book Day X-Men one-shot story titled \\"Pixies and Demons,\\" Pixie returns to her hometown after the X-Men disband following the conclusion of Messiah Complex. However, she finds the demonic N'Garai are plaguing the town and are kidnapping people to feed Kierrok the Damned, their leader. Pixie calls in the X-Men to help defeat the N'Garai and Megan has to face her fear of the mine in which her father was killed in order to defeat the demons. After defeating Kierrok, Cyclops and the rest of the X-Men take her back to America and she joins the newly reformed X-Men in San Francisco.Free Comic Book Day: X-Men - \\"Pixies and Demons\\" (2008) Manifest Destiny After leaving one of Dazzler's gigs, Pixie is ambushed by a group of masked anti- mutant men calling themselves the Hellfire Cult. She is overpowered by the attackers and is subjected to beatings that leave her incapacitated. She manages to make her way back to the X-Men's new base and is immediately taken care of by Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Karma, and Beast.Uncanny X-Men #501 The attack and the events of the previous year cause her to question whether or not she wants to continue as part of the X-Men, but a discussion with Wolverine causes her to stay and assist them against Empath, whose powers have grown out of control. After beating him up, she stabs him in the head with her Souldagger, leaving him blind and his powers weakened.Uncanny X-Men #503 She decides to remain with the X-Men, assisting them in various other missions, including the Skrull invasion of San Francisco.Secret Invasion: X-Men #1 - 4 According to writer Matt Fraction, her role is that of Kitty Pryde and Jubilee when they first joined the X-Men.Kevin Mahadeo.

Her strong magical ability as a teleporter with nearly unlimited distance and capacity also causes Nightcrawler, who is much more limited and traditionally serves as the X-Men's primary teleporter, to question his future usefulness to the team, though he later comes to terms with his own abilities.\\"X-Men: Manifest Destiny #4\\" X-Infernus Despite her cheerful persona, Pixie begins to reveal her anger and bitterness over her initial experience in Limbo and her incomplete soul, feeling that she is less than human. During a training session, Nightcrawler points out that her personality changes when she uses the Souldagger. This causes her to summon it and her personality turns sinister and she stabs him in the chest, causing him to pass out. Upon regaining her senses and removing the dagger, she finds that it has freed the Soulsword housed within Kurt's body. Sensing the Soulsword, Magik teleports to Earth to reclaim it.X-Infernus #1 However, Pixie engages her in a fight, demanding to have the stolen portion of her soul returned and refuses to hand over the sword. Magik defeats her and regains her Soulsword, teleporting away and leaving Colossus distraught. The X-Men learn that they are now able to enter Limbo through Pixie's teleportation spell, and a team consisting of Colossus, Wolverine, Mercury, Rockslide, Pixie, and Nightcrawler is formed to reclaim Magik. Nightcrawler is put in charge due to Pixie's and Colossus' personal stakes in the mission.X-Infernus #2 Pixie brandishing the upgraded Souldagger. Art by Greg Land. While the X-Men battle various demons in Limbo, Belasco's daughter, Witchfire defeats Magik and adds Pixie's Bloodstone to her amulet, causing Pixie to lose control and teleport herself to Belasco's castle. There, Witchfire forces her to become her new apprentice and begins forging a final new Bloodstone from Pixie's soul, causing her to nightmarishly transform completely into a demon.X-Infernus #3 Witchfire uses the Bloodstones to summon the Elder Gods to her aid. Pixie is reluctantly forced to work together with Magik to defeat Witchfire. While the X-Men battle the Elder Gods, Illyana fights Witchfire and strips her of the amulet containing the Bloodstones. Illyana and Pixie use their blades to destroy the amulet, but Witchfire escapes the crumbling castle into the Elder Gods' dimension, claiming to return for her \\"apprentice.\\" Pixie is despondent over losing more of her soul and tries to attack Magik with her Souldagger, but the glowing stone in its blade indicates that the additional stolen piece of her soul is inside it. Pixie flies away in tears into the wilds of Limbo, upset over the additional loss of her soul.X-Infernus#4 Return from Limbo Pixie returns to the X-Men, but demonstrating noticeably improved fighting ability and greater anger when she hears about \\"Proposition X,\\" a piece of anti-mutant legislation seeking to control mutant reproduction.Uncanny X-Men #509 She continues to work with the X-Men, using her abilities to defeat enemies such as Empath and rescue several students and team members, such as when the Sisterhood, a team of mutant villainesses led by a revived Madelyne Pryor, attack the X-Men's headquarters.Uncanny X-Men #510 During the protests between anti-mutant and pro-mutant movements about mutant reproductive rights, Pixie is injured when a riot breaks out.Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Utopia #1 Later she teleports Rogue, Gambit and Danger to San Francisco for assistance.X-Men: Legacy #226 She is later made a part of a team to battle Emma Frost's Dark X-Men.Uncanny X-Men #514 After Emma Frost, Namor and Cloak and Dagger betray the Dark X-Men and Norman Osborn and relocate to Utopia, Pixie and Magik begin teleporting everyone to their new island base.Dark Avengers #8 During the final battle, Pixie joins Armor and X-23 in fighting Daken.Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Exodus One-shot Pixie Strikes Back In the 2010 miniseries Pixie Strikes Back, Pixie finds herself and several of her teenage teammates under a spell, causing them to live under the impression that they are ordinary high school girls. However, the illusion begins to fade, with Pixie finding herself in confrontation with the demon Saturnyne. Meanwhile, a woman arrives on Utopia claiming to be her mother, demanding to see her. Later, her mother shows up in the Wyngarde mansion, where Lady Mastermind is fighting with Martinique. She tells them to stop acting like the babies of the family and that they have been usurped while Pixie is seen in the next panel, revealing that Jason Wyngarde is her father and the Mastermind sisters are her siblings. X-Men: Second Coming When Cable and Hope Summers return from the future, Bastion starts putting his plans into action in taking her out. He first begins by taking out the X-Men's teleporters with Magik the first to fall; sending her to Limbo with a weaponized spell.New Mutants vol. 3 #12 After Ariel is taken out, Pixie requests to take her place only to be refused by Cyclops.X-Men: Legecy #235 Pixie is then placed on a rescue team to get Magik back from Limbo where she encounters N'Astirh who tries to convince her to kill Magik and in exchange he will give her back the rest of her soul. After Pixie turns on him and frees Magik, they assist Anole and Cannonball against Gambit and the corrupted Dazzler and Northstar. After the battle is over the two girls come to understand each other better.X-Men: Second Coming - Revelations: Hellbound #1-3 New Mutants Following the events of Second Coming, like the New Mutants, Pixie goes for a holiday to relax. Magik comes to request her help in her own personal war but Pixie dismisses her, claiming that the last time she helped Magik, she ripped out a piece of her soul and she just rescued her from Limbo. She is then ambushed and captured by Project Purgatory who steal her Souldagger.New Mutants vol. 3 #15 After Project Purgatory capture the New Mutants, they use Magik's Soulsword to separate the bloodstone from Pixie's Souldagger.New Mutants vol. 3 #19 Escaping with Magik and Karma, Pixie is returned to Utopia where she recovers while the rest of the X-Men begin to battle the Elder Gods. Once the Elder Gods and Project Purgatory have been defeated, Magik comes to Pixie with a golden box containing her Souldagger and both her bloodstones.New Mutants vol. 3 #20-21 Hell To Pay Pixie, along with a few other X-Men are summoned to a town by Dani Moonstar where an attack decades earlier by some demons led to them becoming trapped in one of the town's residents to protect them all. Now that she is dying they need to figure out how to deal with the demons. Pixie demonstrates she has some knowledge in sealing spells and entrapment wards. After the arrival of the new Ghost Rider, the demons are released and a battle ensues. Working together with Ghost Rider, they send the demons back to Hell with Pixie reciting a spell, sealing them for good.X-Men vol. 3 # 15.1 X-Men: Schism During the events of Schism, Pixie has been teleporting various teams of X-Men around the world to combat all the sentinels. During one fight she injures her hands and has to sit out as she can no longer teleport. According to her, without painkillers, it hurts too much to concentrate and with them, she cannot think straight enough but will still stand by her fellow students to help take on the giant sentinel approaching Utopia.Generation Hope # 11 Regenesis Recovering from the events of Schism, Pixie approaches Velocidad at first to get help with her medication but when they start talking, things become quite flirty between them and eventually start kissing. Hope walks in and catches them in the act and storms out. Pixie then slaps Velocidad and leaves. Later Pixie is packing to return to Westchester when Hope approaches and begs her to join her team, as they need a teleporter.Generation Hope # 12 After a training exercise, Hope finds a new light on Cerebra and has Pixie teleport the group to Pakistan to locate the mutant. The group splits up with Pixie teamed with Velocidad. They are ambushed by soldiers and separated.Generation Hope # 13 Pixie ends up captured by them and after being rescued, teleports the team and an amnesic Sebastian Shaw back to Utopia.Generation Hope # 14 Wolverine and the X-Men Pixie graduated from the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning and became an official X-Man in the final issue of Wolverine and the X-Men.Wolverine and the X-Men #42 Powers and abilities Megan possesses insect-like wings (depicted of various colors, depending on the artist) that allow her to fly. Initially, her wings were broad and multicolored, similar to a butterfly's, but recent depictions show her to have iridescent, translucent wings, more like those of a dragonfly. It has been suggested that her wings' appearance is affected by her psychological state.X-Men Legacy #248 Pixie using her pixie dust power. Art by Greg Land. In addition, her mutation allows her to produce a \\"pixie dust\\" that causes hallucinations, often with comedic effects, such as demons seeing bright bubbles and teddy bears, or in one instance, causing Wolverine to see and try to fight a herd of unicorns. In another instance, Megan uses her dust seemingly harmlessly to enhance the audience's perceptions of Dazzler's light show during a concert. She states that she has no idea what individuals affected by her dust are seeing. After Magik takes part of Megan's soul in an attempt to create a Soulsword, her appearance changes, reflecting the portion of her soul lost to black magic. Artists' depictions of this change in her personality are inconsistent, but typically depict her pink hair with black streaks. She also has the ability to detect the supernatural, as evidenced when she fought the N'Garai who were under a cloaking spell. When asked how she knows where they are she replies, \\"there's a sliver of darkness that Magik put inside my soul‚Ä¶ And it's like a compass needle for other dark‚Ä¶ stuff.\\" She has also been trained in hand-to- hand combat at the institute. Because the spell to steal Megan's soul was interrupted, a new Soulsword could not be formed; instead, Megan can summon a Souldagger, a mystical item that disrupts magical constructs and harms magical beings. Because of her connection with Magik, as Megan uses the Souldagger, her personality changes and becomes darker and more disturbing. Her dagger later changes from silver to red after it absorbs Pixie's Bloodstone. It is unclear if this change is merely cosmetic. Like recent depictions of the Soulsword,New Mutants vol. 4 #3 Pixie's Souldagger appears to have physical effects beyond disrupting magic and harming magical creatures. For example, while the abilities of the mutant Malice are psionic and based on mutation and not magic, the soul dagger is able to exorcise Malice's psyche from Karima Shapandar. It also appears to have physically harmed Empath, disrupting his psychic abilities and leaving him blind after she stabs him in the head with it. Though untrained in the mystic arts, Pixie possesses the potential to wield magic, largely due to black magic which has filled the missing portions of her soul. Pixie can recite the incantation taught to her by Illyana Rasputin (\\"Sihal Novarum Chinoth\\") to teleport over long distances and to the dimension of Limbo. She is capable of teleporting herself and large groups over vast distances and across dimensions with relative ease, though teleporting without focusing (\\"blind teleporting\\") can be hazardous, causing those transported to be scattered and potentially causing injury to Pixie herself. Following the events of \\"Quest for Magik,\\" Pixie is approached by both Doctor Strange and Amanda Sefton to receive formal tutelage in sorcery after she has come of age. Other versions Age of X In the \\"Age of X\\" reality, Megan is known as \\"Nightmare\\" and her \\"pixie dust\\" causes frightening hallucinations. Compared to her Earth-616 counterpart, her pixie dust only requires skin contact to take effect, instead of inhalation. Her appearance is different as well, with her skin tone lavender and her wings having a bat-like appearance. Her personality is also more sassy and unreserved compared to her Earth-616 counterpart. Ultimate Marvel In the Ultimate Marvel universe, Pixie's wings and hair share a similar rainbow coloration, and besides her wings, her main power is her teleportation, which is natural to her rather than a mystical spell. She requires recharging to teleport, and each teleportation confers a natural high to her. She helps Kitty Pryde to make a final stand against Jean Grey and her nation of Tian.Ultimate Comics: X-Men #32 Pixie is knocked unconscious during the destruction of Tian.Ultimate Comics: X-Men #33 The X-Men find her and a group of survivors Pixie managed to save in the ruins of Tian. A mutant named Amp, who can amplify others' powers, gives Pixie a boost and she attempts to teleport everyone back to Utopia, only to accidentally teleport them into a barren dimension filled with the Gah Lak Tus drone swarm. She manages to save an infected Jimmy Hudson by teleporting the individual infected cells out of his body. The X-Men and Rick Jones (Captain Marvel) hold off the swarm until Pixie can recharge, but she is stabbed by a drone before she can teleport the group away. Avengers vs X-Men Pixie makes a non-canon appearance in a bonus story of Avengers vs. X-Men: Versus #6. Here she is depicted competing against Squirrel Girl in a game resembling HeroClix where the toys are based on various superheroes. Thing walks in, stopping the game to reveal that the figurines actually belong to the Puppet Master and are made out of his Mind Control Clay. The next day, Squirrel Girl and Pixie read in the Daily Bugle that the clash between the Avengers and X-Men has occurred and have been mirroring the results from their game, jokingly implying that they were the cause of the feud. Secret Wars During the Secret Wars crossover event, Pixie appears as a member of the Runaways, and is a high school student at the Victor Von Doom Institute for Gifted Youths. She is best friends and exes with Jubilee, and is established to be bisexual. She is paired up with the other characters for their Institute's final exam.Runaways vol 4. #1 During the Institute's battle examination, she is killed by a rival team. It was believed by the school's students that the exam was only virtual, and those dead in it were swiftly expelled, but her team discovers her body by accident, and decide to run away from the institute.Runaways vol 4. #2 In other media Television * Pixie appears in Wolverine and the X-Men, voiced by Kate Higgins.

Retrieved 2016-09-30. Career Ul de Rico was born in 1944 in Udine, Italy. He lived in Munich for many years, studying at the Munich Academy. He studied painting under Professor Franz Nagel and, under the tutelage of Professor Rudolf Heinrich, received his diploma in stage and costume design. He now lives in France. The Rainbow Goblins was published in 1978 in Germany, and was translated into English in the same year by Stanley Baron. It is a story of 7 evil goblins, each a different color of the rainbow, who travel through the land catching rainbows and stealing their color. The work was praised for its enchanting oil-on-oak illustrations, which vividly draw the reader into the world of the goblins; and its simple story, which teaches children about color as well as reverence for natural beauty. In 1980, Ul de Rico wrote and illustrated The Ring of the Nibelung: Wagner's epic drama, an interpretation of the extraordinary 15-hour epic Opera series composed by Richard Wagner over the course of 26 years. de Rico's story was a simplified, truncated version of the full play cycle, which took several creative liberties, the most noticeable of which was the use of the three Norns as narrators throughout the story, rather than merely for G√∂tterd√§mmerung, as in the original. The oil-on-oak color paintings were all designed similarly: the painting was ringed by the three Norns and their golden rope, and the top half of the painting showed a different scene from the bottom. The top image and bottom image were connected thematically, but not sequentially within the story. In 1982, Ul de Rico illustrated Richard Adams' short novel The Legend of Te Tuna, a story based on characters from Polynesian mythology. His paintings complemented Adams' poetic verse quite effectively. His work on the NeverEnding Story (1984) was similarly vivid and fantastic; the production team based many of their storyboards and animations on his creations from the novel. There were additional characters he created that were not produced. In 1996, Ul de Rico painted a sequel to his original Goblins story entitled The White Goblin. The paintings were of a similar vein to his previous work, but many were nearly devoid of color and were a stark contrast to the effulgence of the originals. This was done deliberately, as the White Goblin had a more ecologically sinister plot than his brethren, one that involved habitat destruction and the subjugation of natural resources for his own selfish ends. This book seems appropriate for an age group somewhat older than that of the first. The moral lessons (as well as the story, illustrations and language) are more complex and profound than before. Ul de Rico also has illustrated covers for music albums as well.Discogs entry In 1981, Japanese musician Masayoshi Takanaka released a Jazz/Rock album entitled The Rainbow Goblins that was based on Ul de Rico's book of the same name.Discogs entry: Masayoshi Takanaka ‚Äì The Rainbow Goblins In 2017, the band Primus released The Desaturating Seven, a concept album also inspired by the text and art of The Rainbow Goblins. Style His paintings carry a slightly surreal theme which allows readers to be drawn into their colorful imaginary world while still being reminded of the beautiful natural world which inspired them.

KGaA. It was the world's first antibacterial soap. History Dial was developed by a chemist from Armour and Company, a meat-packing company, and introduced in the Chicago market in 1948. Armour had produced soap since 1888; its laundry soap was made from tallow, a by-product of Armour's meat production processes. Dial was made antibacterial by the addition of hexachlorophene, referred to by the company as AT-7. The product was named Dial and promised \\"round-the-clock\\" protection against the odor caused by perspiration. Dial was introduced nationally in 1949 and was advertised as \\"the first active, really effective deodorant soap in all history [because it] removes skin bacteria that cause perspiration odor\\". Although researchers had never established a link between hexachlorophene and germ protection, Armour's early advertisements graphically depicted germs and microbes before and after use of Dial soap. Hexachlorophene, the active ingredient in Dial, was removed from the consumer market and strictly limited in the hospital setting in the early 1970s amid reports that it caused neurological damage in infants. When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) outlawed its use in non-medicinal products, Armour-Dial replaced it with triclocarban, a synthetic antibacterial compound. Dial became the leading deodorant soap brand in the U.S. From 1953 until the mid-1990s, Dial soap was advertised under the slogan \\"Aren't you glad you use Dial? (Don't you wish everybody did?)\\" which became a popular catchphrase. In September 2016, the FDA ruled that antibacterial soaps containing triclocarban and triclosan can no longer be marketed. Dial replaced these ingredients with benzalkonium chloride (for bar soaps) and benzethonium chloride (for liquid hand soaps). In its 2016 ruling, the FDA also stated that it is deferring the final rule on benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride and chloroxylenol by a year to allow for the development and submission of new safety and effectiveness data for these ingredients. Consumer antibacterial washes containing these specific ingredients may be marketed during this time while data are being collected. Products In addition to the original bar soap, other products sold under the Dial name include liquid body wash, hand sanitizer, and lotions. Dial liquid hand soap was the fifth bestselling brand in the United States in 2011.

The painting is on display at Penlee House. Newlyn Copper was a class of arts and crafts copperware originating in Newlyn in Cornwall. http://www.artscrafts.org.uk/branches/newlyn/newlynhistory.html  History  In the late 19th century the fishing industry in Cornwall was becoming unreliable as a source of income; bad weather and seasonal fluctuations brought enforced periods of inactivity. It was decided that an alternative means of employment could be gained by training the unemployed fishermen to produce items in copper. John Drew Mackenzie, an artist who settled at Newlyn was a key figure in setting up the Newlyn Industrial Class, assisted by the benefactor and local Member of Parliament, Thomas Bedford Bolitho, and artists Reginald Dick, T. C. Gotch, Perry Craft and John Pearson. After some early experiments, the class specialised in repouss√© copper work and produced a wide range of domestic and decorative items. The school remained active for about thirty years after its establishment in 1890. Other known artists who produced work in the Newlyn style included: Herbert Dyer, Obed Nicholls, Phillip Hodder, William Pezzack, Tom Batten, John Payne Cotton, John Curnow, John Edgar Laity, George Mildren, Joe Pengelly, William P. Wright and William Tonkin. The range of objects produced by the class including trays, mirror and photograph frames, chambersticks, plates and chargers, boxes, bowls and coffee pots: designs typically featured fish, ships and other nautical themes.

The school, which serves grades 9 through 12, is a part of the Fort Worth Independent School District (FWISD).  History  The Western Hills community encompasses the urban area surrounding the school, the Benbrook city area, southwest Fort Worth, and the rural section west to the Tarrant County line. The city of Benbrook school system once served students in Benbrook and surrounding rural areas. In 1954, all Benbrook students above the sixth grade were transferred to the Fort Worth ISD. In 1962, the Benbrook School District was consolidated into the Fort Worth system, busing the high school students to North Side High School or Arlington Heights High School and its junior high schools to J.P. Elder or William Monnig Junior High. Western Hills was first opened on the campus of Arlington Heights High School in the fall of 1968 with 714 students crowded into thirteen temporary buildings. In January 1969, this student body moved into its new home on the twenty-five acre tract in West Fort Worth at 3600 Boston Avenue. The creation of General Dynamics Fort Worth Division in nearby White Settlement spurred an increased enrollment from the original 714 to 2,243 in 1972. At that time the student body was housed not only in the main building with one level but also in 23 portable buildings. With a decreasing student enrollment of 2,052 in the fall of 1980, the school building was expanded to two floors and eliminated the portable buildings. On October 23, 1989, a briefcase containing a firebomb was found. During an attempt to disarm the device it exploded causing mostly smoke damage and no injuries.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=K_8gAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=-3IFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=4005,5515874&dq;=bomb+explodes+fort+worth&hl;=enhttps://news.google.com/newspapers?id=t4IgAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=R8AEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=2442,4111269&dq;=bomb+explodes+fort+worth&hl;=en In 1991, the decline of student enrollment had tapered off to 1,503, reflecting of job losses from the sale of General Dynamics' Fort Worth division to Lockheed. In recent years, school enrollment has ranged between 1,461 and 1,503. Recently, 14 portable buildings have been added to the campus.  Spirit  The Western Hills cougar insignia The school mascot is the cougar. Official school colors are forest green and gold and throwback colors reflecting early years are yellow and green. The WHHS student newspaper is The Mountain Line, (a cougar is also known as a mountain lion) begun in the spring of 1970. The paper won the best-in-city award in its first year in a contest sponsored by the Fort Worth press. Western Hills High School's school annual yearbook is named The Catamount. The name was chosen by the new school's annual staff after suggestions made by annual staff members.

Sports  WHHS currently competes as a University Interscholastic League Class 4A school. Baseball In 2001 Western Hills won the Texas Class 4A State baseball championship. Football The Cougars' home games are usually played in the FWISD's Farrington Field, but the team also frequently plays in Herman Clark Stadium and Scarborough-Handley Field when facing opponents that also belong to the school district. In its inaugural year, the school's football team lost every game. The school years 1969 and 1970 saw the school's football team make a complete turn around and go on to win bi-district both years. =Playoff appearances= The Cougars have competed in the post-season playoffs toward the state title fifteen times, advancing to the second round three times.

Crane was originally a law student, but not liking it, he dropped out after two years and worked as an acrobat in a circus for three years. To fulfill English requirements for stuntmen to achieve instructor level in six sports, Crane became an instructor in gymnastics, parachuting, scuba diving, high diving, karate, and fencing. When he could not obtain a union card as a stuntman fast enough, he became an instructor in three more sports, including hang gliding.His father was Dr. John Crane, who was the doctor for Arsenal F.C and the England national football team. Career Crane's first major work came in the 1985 Bond film A View to a Kill. In 1987 he became Timothy Dalton's stunt double in The Living Daylights. He also played the character of Che Che in a reenactment of the \\"gatecrasher\\" fight scene from On Her Majesty's Secret Service traditionally used to test the fighting skills of actors up for the part of James Bond. Vic Armstrong coordinated the fight. Actors believed to have tested opposite Crane in the screen tests include Mark Greenstreet, Sam Neill and Pierce Brosnan. After spending five years as the apprentice to an experienced stunt coordinator, Crane was allowed to act as second unit stunt coordinator on Licence to Kill. In 1993, Crane performed the dangerous-looking aerial transfer for the film Cliffhanger, for which he earned an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records for being part of the most expensive stunt ever performed. It cost $1 million to have Simon Crane descending on a rope between two planes at an altitude of 4,572 m (15,000 ft). In 1995 he became the overall stunt coordinator for GoldenEye ‚Äì the opening bungee jump was voted the greatest film stunt ever in a poll for Sky Movies. After a four-year break from the Bond franchise, during which he coordinated stunts for the Academy-Award-winning films Titanic (in which he happened to play fourth officer Joseph Boxhall, and only had one line) and Saving Private Ryan, Crane returned to handle the stunts for The World Is Not Enough, with Vic Armstrong as second unit director. Crane also took the role of stunt coordinator in Will Smith's Hancock (2008). He was to make his directorial d√©but directing a film adaptation of the popular video game, Kane & Lynch: Dead Men but departed from the project. Crane directed the 3-D supernatural thriller The Peak, which was based on a screenplay from Neal Marshall Stevens and Crane worked with Will Smith again as second unit director and stunt coordinator on Men in Black 3.

Early life and education Richard Lee Roberts was born on November 12, 1948, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the son of evangelist Granville Oral Roberts (died 2009) and school teacher Evelyn Lutman Roberts (died 2005). The third born of four Roberts children, he had an older sister, Rebecca Ann, who along with her husband, Marshall Nash, was killed in a plane crash in 1977, and an older brother, Ronald David, who died in 1982 in what was determined to be suicide. Robert's younger sister, Roberta Jean Potts, is a practicing attorney in Tulsa, Oklahoma. As a young boy, Roberts watched his father travel the United States and the world conducting healing meetings where he would preach and pray for the sick. At times, his father and mother were gone for periods as long as six weeks. When school permitted, Roberts accompanied his father on trips and dreamed of having a healing ministry of his own; many times walking by his side as his father prayed for people in the \\"invalid tent\\".\\"Claim Your Inheritance by Richard Roberts, 2002, The Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, pages 19-20,\\" During the portions of the services where people were getting prayed for,\\"You Can Touch Heaven With Your Faith by Richard Roberts, 1991, The Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, page 23,\\" Roberts was often standing on his chair clapping when people were healed.

Richard singing at his father's crusades At the age of 5 he had his first public performance at an Oral Roberts crusade in Baltimore, Maryland, standing on a chair in front of several thousand people singing \\"I Believe.\\" Also at an early age, his father began to teach him the game of golf. With his first swing of the club, while in their front yard, he sent a ball right through the living room window of their home. In his book, Expect A Miracle My Life and Ministry by Oral Roberts, Oral talks about the bond they gained through the game of golf. Roberts eventually became an excellent golfer and played with notable celebrities. Though drawn to ministry, Roberts was made uncomfortable by all the attention his father received. He was often teased by classmates and even teachers, and even got into fights about his father. \\"I came home from school many a day with my shirt torn and my nose bloodied from being in fights with the other kids who made fun of me, my dad and the healing ministry of Jesus Christ.\\" As a teenager, with the negative press his father was receiving and pressure from his father to sing at crusades, he began to pull away from involvement with his father's ministry and began pursuing other talents and interests, such as singing.\\"Faith to Try Again by Richard Roberts, 1997, Albury Publishing, page 13\\" As a teenager he learned to play the guitar and began singing in pizza parlors and eventually nightclubs around the state of Oklahoma. There was a new dream in his heart, to become a nightclub singer in Las Vegas. In 1966, during Roberts‚Äô senior year in high school he played the lead in his high school play The Sound of Music. He then was offered a music scholarship for the summer to the Interlochen Center for the Arts in Traverse City, Michigan, by the founder Joseph Maddy, when Maddy brought a performing group to the Oral Roberts University campus.

After prayer, Oral believed that God was not through with Richard and he was still to be involved in the ministry. Roberts remarries and continues traveling doing concerts and singing on television. The concerts transform into a combination of music, preaching and ministry events where Roberts is praying for people and people are testifying they have been healed.

For years, the Ministry had been able to fund the short fall but it too was running tight budgets and not able to help as much as in the past. In his The Joy of the Lord book, Roberts talks about the daily pressure and concerns about cash flow. \\"I spent most of my time putting out fires with bankers and creditors ‚Ä¶and awoke many nights with nightmares of the University shutting down.\\" \\"Claim Your Inheritance, Richard Roberts, Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, 2002, page 64\\" Roberts assembled a team from his executive staff to work with him on resolving the financial problems.

A ruthless gang called \\"The Templars\\" constantly raid settlers in an attempt to exterminate everyone in order to purge the Earth. A former Templar, Scorpion, along with his allies, prevents a small band of religious colonists from being massacred by the Templars.

When discussing 1990: The Bronx Warriors, The New Barbarians and Escape from the Bronx, Castellari stated the three films were written, prepared and filmed in six months. For the stunts in the film, Castellari stated that he filmed each scene at three different speeds: 24fps, 55 and 96. Castellari stated that this allowed him to \\"edit the whole sequence in a more interesting way. It gives much more impact to the entire stunt and it actually looks much more impressive and powerful than it actually is.\\" Release The New Barbarians was released in Italy on 7 April 1983. It was released in the United States in January 1984 under the title of Warriors of the Wasteland. It was distributed by New Line Cinema. Reception Castellari had positive recollections of making the film, stating that it \\"was an extremely cheap movie. The budget was incredibly small but I'm quite proud that I succeeded in making a movie shot on the outskirts of Rome.\\" Variety found the film derivative of Mad Max 2 as well as having elements of Hal Needham's Megaforce and other films. Variety felt that Casterllari made a mistake in using slow motion opposed to George Miller's exciting high-sped action scenes, finding that the films car chases \\"look to be occurring at 25 mph\\". In his book Phil Hardy's book Science Fiction (1984), a review found the film to be too derivative of Mad Max 2. The Monthly Film Bulletin described the film as a \\"shamelessly watered-down, warmed-over\\" version of Mad Max 2. In a retrospective review, AllMovie awarded the film two stars out of five, found that the film captures \\"the true spirit of the low budget rip-off flicks from early 80's, The New Barbarians is neither smart nor original, but a riot for anyone who gets off on Mad Max and all of its the junky followers.\\"  References  Bibliography  External links * * Category:1983 films Category:Italian action thriller films Category:Italian-language films Category:Films directed by Enzo G.

From 1923 on there was also an active group in Brno. The movement discontinued its activities in 1930 (1927 in Brno). Founded as U. S. Devƒõtsil (Umƒõleck√Ω Svaz Devƒõtsil - Devƒõtsil Artistic Federation), its name was changed several times. From 1925, it was called the Svaz modern√≠ kultury Devƒõtsil (the Devƒõtsil Union of Modern Culture). The artistic output of its members was varied, but typically focused on magic realism, proletkult, and, beginning in 1923, Poetism, an artistic program formulated by V√≠tƒõzslav Nezval and Karel Teige. The group was very active in organizing the Czech art scene of the period. Members published several art magazines - ReD (Revue Devƒõtsilu), Disk and P√°smo, as well as occasional anthologies (most importantly Devƒõtsil and ≈Ωivot) and organized several exhibitions. For the most part, Devƒõtsil artists produced poetry and illustration, but they also made contributions to many other art forms, including sculpture, film and even calligraphy. For about two years Devƒõtsil functioned without any particular theoretical grounding, but as the members changed and those that remained developed and modified their style, it was decided, particularly by Karel Teige, that they begin formulating theories behind their activity. Most of these theories were to be spread through manifestos published by the group. Like any good theorist, Teige was always ready to change his ideas and sometimes moved from one aesthetic to an opposite one. The group formulated a movement that they called Poetism. The long echoed cry, ‚Äúmake it new,‚Äù was vital to the Poetists way of thinking. The Devƒõtsil members were surrounded by the new in science, architecture and industry. Even their country was new. In order for art to survive, or at least in order to be worthwhile, it had to constantly be ahead of other changes in life. The Poetists advocated the law of antagonism. This law explains historical progress as reliant on discontinuity. New types and styles of art are continuously necessary for development and vital to these changes are conditions of contradiction. The first manifesto of Devƒõtsil urged new artists to look deeper into ordinary objects for poetic quality. Skyscrapers, airplanes, mimes, and poster lettering were the new arts. Inspired by the Berlin Dadaists, Seifert claimed ‚Äúart is dead.‚Äù Following him, Teige remarked, ‚Äúthe most beautiful paintings in existence today are the ones which were not painted by anyone.‚Äù Between 1923 and 1925, the picture poem was a popular form among the Devƒõtsil artists. Typography and optical poetry was the new lexical standard. Teige explained this transformation of language into visual art as relating to the rise of photography, film and new developments in book printing. For several members of Devƒõtsil, the picture poem replaced painting and eventually both pictures and poems made their way from the page to film. Teige and Seifert began writing film scripts and using the dissolve technique as a way of poetically morphing objects into other objects. Significant members Devƒõtsil is the Czech name for the butterbur plant. The name literally translates to nine forces.

It appears to have resembled the lectica; and the only difference apparently was, that the lectica was carried on the shoulders of slaves, and the basterna by two mules, according to Isaac Casaubon. Several etymologies of the word have been proposed. Salmasius proposes it to be derived from the Greek (Salm. ad Lamprid. Heliog. 21). Cassius Dio links it to the people known as the Bastarnae, living in what is now southern Ukraine.Dio LI.24.4. A description of a basterna is given by a poet in the Anth. Lat. iii. 183. Others call it a kind of chariot, and say it was drawn by oxen to go more gently. Gregory de Tours gives an instance of it being carried by wild bulls. The interior was called cavea, 'cage'; and it had soft cushions or beds. The mode of basterna's passed from Italy into Gaul, and then into other countries.

Based on the 1992 novel The Positronic Man by Isaac Asimov and Robert Silverberg (which is itself based on Asimov's original 1976 novelette \\"The Bicentennial Man\\"), the plot explores issues of humanity, slavery, prejudice, maturity, intellectual freedom, conformity, sex, love, mortality, and eternal life. The film, a co-production between Touchstone Pictures and Columbia Pictures, was directed by Chris Columbus. The title comes from the main character existing to the age of two hundred years, and Asimov's novelette was published in 1976, the year the United States had its bicentennial. Though the film was a box-office bomb, makeup artist Greg Cannom was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Makeup at the 72nd Academy Awards. The theme song of the film, which was written by James Horner and Will Jennings and sung by Celine Dion, is \\"Then You Look at Me\\". Plot The NDR series robot \\"Andrew\\" is introduced in 2005 into the Martin family home to perform housekeeping and maintenance duties, and introduces himself by showing a presentation of the Three Laws of Robotics. The younger Amanda is sympathetic to him, and Andrew discovers he feels emotions, and is drawn to spend more time with his \\"Little Miss\\". He accidentally breaks one of her glass figurines and is able to carve a new one out of wood, which surprises Richard, her father. Richard takes Andrew to NorthAm Robotics to inquire if Andrew's creativity was part of his programming. NorthAm's CEO Dennis Mansky claims this is a problem and offers to scrap Andrew, but instead Richard takes Andrew back home and encourages him to continue his creativity and explore other humanities. Andrew becomes a clockmaker and earns a sizable fortune managed by Richard after they find that robots have no rights under current laws. Time passes, and Richard encourages Dennis to give Andrew the ability to present facial expressions to match his emotions. About two decades from being awoken, Andrew presents Richard with all the money he has made to ask for his freedom. Richard refuses to accept it but does grant Andrew his independence, on the condition he may no longer reside at the Martin home. Andrew builds his own home by the beach. In 2048, Richard is on his death bed, and apologizes to Andrew for banishing him before he dies. Following Richard's death, Andrew goes on a quest to find other NDR robots that are like him, frequently communicating back to Amanda, who has since married and divorced, and has a son Lloyd and granddaughter Portia. Twenty years into Andrew's quest, he discovers Galatea, an NDR robot that has been modified with female personality and traits. Andrew becomes interested in how Galatea was modified by Rupert Burns, the son of the original NDR designer, and finds he has a number of potential ideas to help make robots appear more human-like. Andrew agrees to fund Rupert's work and to be a test subject, and is soon given a human-like appearance. Twenty years later, Andrew finally returns to the Martin home and finds that Amanda has grown old while Portia looks much like her grandmother at her age. Portia is initially cautious of Andrew, but soon accepts him as part of the Martin family. Amanda eventually dies, and Andrew realizes that all those he cares for will also pass on. He presents ideas to Rupert to create artificial organs that not only can be used in humans to prolong their lives but also to replace Andrew's mechanical workings. Andrew gains the ability to eat, feel emotions and sensations, and even have sexual relationships, resulting in him and Portia falling in love. Andrew petitions the World Congress to recognize him as a human as to allow him to marry Portia, but the body expresses concern that an immortal human will cause jealousy from others. Andrew returns to Rupert for one last operation: to change the artificial fluids driving his body into a blood equivalent. Rupert cautions him that the blood will not last forever, causing his body to age, and Andrew will die in several more decades, a fate Andrew accepts. Decades later, Andrew again approaches the World Congress to appeal their past decision, wanting to be able to die with dignity. Later, with Andrew's body deteriorating, he and Portia are both under life support monitored by Galatea, now with a human appearance. They hold hands and watch the World Congress as they recognize Andrew as a human being, the world's oldest at 200 years, and giving all rights confirmed by that, including validating his marriage to Portia. During the broadcast, Andrew passes away, confirmed by Galatea. Portia asserts that Andrew already knew the answer to whether he was human and then, after ordering Galatea to turn off her life support, she soon dies, hand-in- hand with Andrew.

Disney chairman Joe Roth came to an agreement with Sony Pictures Entertainment Chairman John Calley, to co-finance film and agreeing to split distribution for the film between Touchstone in North America and Columbia Pictures internationally. Williams confirmed in a Las Vegas Sun interview that his character was not played by a body double and that he had actually worn the robot costume. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 36% based on 97 reviews, with an average rating of 4.78/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Bicentennial Man is ruined by a bad script and ends up being dull and mawkish.\\" On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100, based on reviews from 31 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert gave it two out of four stars: Bicentennial Man begins with promise, proceeds in fits and starts, and finally sinks into a cornball drone of greeting-card sentiment. Robin Williams spends the first half of the film encased in a metallic robot suit, and when he emerges, the script turns robotic instead. What a letdown. William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer said: \\"[The film] becomes a somber, sentimental and rather profound romantic fantasy that is more true to the spirit of the Golden Age of science-fiction writing than possibly any other movie of the '90s.\\" Todd McCarthy of Variety summed it up as \\"an ambitious tale handled in a dawdling, sentimental way.\\" Accolades * Academy Awards ‚Äî Best Makeup (lost to Topsy-Turvy) * Blockbuster Entertainment Award ‚Äî Favorite Actor ‚Äî Comedy (Robin Williams) (lost to Adam Sandler in Big Daddy) * Blockbuster Entertainment Award ‚Äî Favorite Actress ‚Äî Comedy (Embeth Davidtz) (lost to Drew Barrymore in Never Been Kissed) * Hollywood Makeup Artist and Hair Stylist Guild Award ‚Äî Best Character Makeup ‚Äî Feature (lost to Sleepy Hollow) * Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards ‚Äî Favorite Movie Actor (Robin Williams) (lost to Adam Sandler in Big Daddy) * Razzie Award ‚Äî Worst Actor (Robin Williams) (lost to Adam Sandler in Big Daddy) * YoungStar Award ‚Äî Best Young Actress/Performance in a Motion Picture Comedy (Hallie Kate Eisenberg) (lost to Natalie Portman in Where the Heart Is) References External links * Bicentennial Man at D23.com  Category:1999 films Category:1990s science fiction comedy-drama films Category:American robot films Category:American science fiction comedy-drama films Category:American films Category:Android (robot) films Category:Films about artificial intelligence Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on science fiction novels Category:Films directed by Chris Columbus Category:Films set in 2005 Category:Films set in 2048 Category:Films set in the 21st century Category:Films set in the 22nd century Category:Films set in the 23rd century Category:Films set in the future Category:Films set in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Films set in Washington, D.C.

He studied English at Christ Church, Oxford. Both political journalist and film theorist, Wollen's Signs and Meaning in the Cinema (1969) helped to transform the discipline of film studies by incorporating the methodology of structuralism and semiotics. He taught film at a number of universities and was Professor Emeritus at the University of California, Los Angeles at the time of his retirement from academe in 2005. Life Wollen was born on June 29, 1938, in Woodford, northeast London, to Douglas and Winifred (Waterman) Wollen. Douglas was a Methodist minister and Winifred was a teacher. Peter attended a Methodist boarding school, Kingswood School, in Bath, Somerset, England. In 1959, Wollen graduated from the University of Oxford with a degree in English literature. In 1968, Wollen married noted film theorist and his partner in filmmaking, Laura Mulvey. They divorced in 1993 and soon afterward he wed writer and artist, Leslie Dick. He had a son from his first marriage and a daughter from his second. Wollen died of Alzheimer's disease on December 17, 2019, from which he had suffered for many years. Academic career By the mid-1960s, Wollen was writing for journals such as the New Left Review under the pseudonym of Lee Russell.\\"A Brief History of New Left Review 1960-2010,\\" New Left Review, https://newleftreview.org/historyFor example, a piece on John Ford appeared in the NLR issue of September‚ÄìOctober 1965. It's anthologized in Through a bit of self-reflexivity, Wollen interviewed himself as Lee Russell in 1997. Wollen joined the British Film Institute's education department in the late 1960s, at the behest of its director, Paddy Whannel, who had been impressed by his work. Wollen explained, \\"One of the basic goals of the education department was to support anyone who wanted to teach film in schools or universities. And one way to support them was by publishing books which they could use in class.\\" Subsequently, the BFI created a series of film books titled, \\"Cinema One,\\" and Signs and Meaning in the Cinema was the ninth book released under that banner. Signs and Meaning in the Cinema's initial publication in 1969 was followed by a revised edition, with a new appendix, just three years later. It quickly gained traction in the burgeoning film-studies world of the 1970s. In 1976, Robin Wood contended, \\"Peter Wollen's Signs and Meaning in the Cinema is probably the most influential book on film in English of the past decade.\\" Also quoted in Theories of Authorship: A Reader. And the book has continued to wield influence decades later‚Äîhaving been released in a fifth, \\"silver\\" edition in 2013. In a Sight & Sound poll in 2010, Signs and Meaning repeatedly cropped up‚Äîleading critic Nick Roddick to exclaim, \\"If there is one book to rule them all, it is Peter Wollen's Signs and Meaning in the Cinema. The revised and enlarged edition of 1972 is the most concise, lucid and inspiring introduction to thinking about film ever written.\\" Filmography Wollen's first film credit was as cowriter of Michelangelo Antonioni's The Passenger (Professione: Reporter, Italy, 1975), and he made his debut as a director with Penthesilea: Queen of the Amazons (1974), the first of six films cowritten and co-directed with his wife, Laura Mulvey. The low-budget Penthesilea portrayed women's language and mythology as silenced by patriarchal structures. Acknowledging the influence of Jean-Luc Godard's Le Gai savoir (France, 1968), Wollen intended the film to fuse avant-garde and radically political elements. The resulting work is innovative in the context of British cinema history, although its relentlessly didactic approach did not make for mass appeal. For Riddles of the Sphinx (1977), Wollen and Mulvey obtained a BFI Production Board grant, which enabled them to work with greater technical resources, rewriting the Oedipal myth from a female standpoint. The deliberately ahistorical AMY! (1980), commemorating Amy Johnson's solo flight from Britain to Australia, synthesises themes previously covered by Wollen and Mulvey. In Crystal Gazing (1982) formal experimentation is muted and narrative concerns emphasised. Frida Kahlo and Tina Modotti (1982), a short film tied to an international art exhibition curated by Wollen, and The Bad Sister (1982), a drama based on a novel by Emma Tennant, were the final projects on which Wollen and Mulvey collaborated. Wollen's only solo feature, Friendship's Death (1987), starring Bill Paterson and Tilda Swinton, is the story of the relationship between a British war correspondent and a female extraterrestrial robot on a peace mission to Earth, who, missing her intended destination of MIT, inadvertently lands in Amman, Jordan during the events of Black September 1970. Popular culture The Sydney University Film Group and WEA Film Study Group used Wollen's Signs and Meaning in the Cinema for the basis of a season of film screenings talks and discussions on the ideas in the book in September and October 1969.Sydney University Film Group Bulletin.

Career  Tavano started his professional career with Pisa, before being sold to minor Florence team Rondinella, then in Serie C2. He then joined Empoli, where he slowly established himself as one of the stars of the small Tuscan team. During the January 2006 transfer window, several Italian football pundits claimed that Real Madrid were interested in signing Tavano,Empoli's Tavano excited by Real Madrid interest, tribalfootball.com, January 5, 2006 but he eventually signed for Valencia in mid-2006, for ‚Ç¨9 million.Empoli FC SpA bilancio (financial report and accounts) on 30 June 2007 , PDF purchased from Italian CCIAA He received a call-up from the Italian national team in April 2006, when manager Marcello Lippi held trails for the 23-man squad that would go on to win the 2006 FIFA World Cup, but he never made his international debut. His time in Spain, however, proved to be unsuccessful, as he fell out with coaching staff after making statements in the press which led to him being a sub player for the majority of his short stay in Spain. Tavano then returned to Italy for a loan spell with Roma, where he mostly served as a reserve player for the main giallorossi strikers, although he was able to win the 2006‚Äì07 Coppa Italia with the club. In 2007, he was permanently signed by Livorno, for a reported ‚Ç¨5.5 million on a 4-year contract. He received the number 10 jersey, previously retired in honour of Igor Protti and unretired that year under explicit request from the former amaranto star. Despite being the club top scorer in his comeback season in Tuscany, his side did not manage to escape from relegation. Tavano agreed to stay at Livorno also in their 2008‚Äì09 Serie B campaign in order to try to lead his team back into the top flight. He scored a hat-trick against Avellino on the opening day of the season, making it the first round 1 hat-trick since 1994. He would then score at Piacenza, before standing back to back with a teammate in celebration. He missed a penalty against his former club Empoli with the score tied at 1‚Äì1, before Antonio Busce scored Empoli's winner. Tavano would, however, get a goal in the 5‚Äì2 win over Frosinone, on the way to 25 for the season, giving him the capocannoniere title, and ensuring promotion through the playoffs after missing out on automatic promotion to Bari and Parma. However, he had a hard season in Serie A, as Livorno were the only newly promoted team to go down. He scored the winner at Roma, but only scored 4 other goals. He was also inconsistent, so much so that one fan interrupted training to slap him. He was still described as important. New manager Giuseppe Pillon said, \\"He is a fundamental player but must be motivated. I believe he has a desire for revenge after a poor Serie A Season.\\" Honours Club ;Roma *Coppa Italia: 2006‚Äì07  References   External links  Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:People from Caserta Category:Italian footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Empoli F.C. players Category:U.S. Avellino 1912 players Category:La Liga players Category:Valencia CF players Category:A.S.

It was primarily negotiated by the Protestant queen of Navarre, Jeanne d'Albret. In the third war, fought between Catholics and Protestants from 1568 to 1570, the Protestant Huguenots had suffered a setback at the Battle of Jarnac (1569), where their general, the prince de Cond√©, was slain; and following the appointment of Henry of Navarre (later Henri IV) as new leader of the Huguenot cause, the peace treaty was signed by King Charles IX for the Catholics, and by Admiral Gaspard de Coligny for the Huguenots, granting the Huguenots control of four 'fortified towns': La Rochelle, Cognac, Montauban and La Charit√© for two years. Moreover, Protestants were henceforth to be allowed to hold public office in France, and Catherine de' Medici, mother of Charles IX, promised to give her daughter Marguerite de Valois in marriage with Henry of Navarre. The treaty provoked the fury of the uncompromising Catholics and tensions between the two remained high, as evidenced by the 1571 Rouen incident where some forty Protestants were massacred after refusing to kneel for Communion. A year later, the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre led to the resumption of hostilities.

Early life  On May 30, 1940, Ackroyd was born in East Orange, New Jersey, a suburb of Newark; he moved to Wayne, New Jersey when he was 12 years old.Denis, Paul.Daytime TV's Star Directory, p. 30. Popular Library, 1976. Accessed July 21, 2019. \\"David Ackroyd Personal Life: Born in East Orange, N.J., David's family (of Irish-English background) moved to Wayne, N.J., when he was 12.\\" Career David Ackroyd extended his all-stage career into film and television in the early 1970s, beginning with daytime leading man outings in The Secret Storm and Another World. He progressed to prime time work as Gary Ewing in Dallas until Ted Shackelford successfully took over the role when the character moved front and center with the spin-off drama Knots Landing, though Ackroyd himself would later appear on Knots Landing as a guest star, playing a different character. Coincidentally, Shackelford's last recurring role prior to Dallas was on Another World. His prime on-camera work occurred in the late 1970s with a series of strong co-star roles in the miniseries The Dark Secret of Harvest Home as Nick Constantine; The Word and the TV-movies And I Alone Survived and Exo-Man. He costarred in the short-lived series AfterMASH and A Peaceable Kingdom. He began to find supporting roles in such movies as The Mountain Men, Dark Angel and Xena: Warrior Princess. He voiced \\"John Cavanaugh/Prince Corran of Dar-Shan\\" in the animated series Wildfire as well as several characters in The New Yogi Bear Show, The Greatest Adventure: Stories from the Bible, The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest and The New Adventures of Captain Planet. On Broadway, Ackroyd appeared in Unlikely Heroes, a 1971 production of three plays based on the stories of Philip Roth; and Children of a Lesser God, in which he replaced John Rubinstein as the lead character, James Leeds, in 1981. Since the late 1990s and into the 2000s, Ackroyd has narrated documentary television series like History's Mysteries and UFO Files: \\"Alien Engineering\\". Ackroyd moved to Montana in 1996. In 2003, he co-founded the Alpine Theatre Project in Whitefish, a professional acting company, of which he is the Artistic Development Director. The project has featured appearances by such notable performers as Olympia Dukakis, John Lithgow and Kelli O'Hara.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has recommended the generic term 'local site', which is divided into 'local wildlife site' and 'local geological site'. There are approximately 35,000 local sites, and according to the former Minister for Biodiversity, Jim Knight, they make a vital contribution to delivering the UK and Local Biodiversity Action Plans and the Geodiversity Action Plan, as well as maintaining local natural character and distinctiveness. Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) and local nature reserves (LNRs) have statutory protection, but they are only intended to cover a representative selection of sites, and Local sites are intended to provide comprehensive coverage of sites of nature conservation value. Local sites do not have statutory protection (unless they are also SSSIs or LNRs), but local authorities are expected to take account of the need to protect them in deciding their planning and development policies. Selection methodology Local sites are designated by local authorities in cooperation with Wildlife Trusts, RIGS Groups or Geology Trusts, or their equivalents. For example, in Kent, local wildlife sites are identified by the Kent Wildlife Trust). Selection is objective and is normally based upon a recent survey specifically designed for SNCI, but selection on the basis of existing, published information may also occur. The approach is similar to that used for the selection of biological Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), but the thresholds are lower. Selection is primarily for habitats of inherent wildlife interest, but some sites may be selected for supporting rare or scarce species of plants or animals outside such habitats. The areas concerned may be areas of 'natural' habitats, or they may be man-made - for example, the West Norwood Cemetery is designated a Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation by the London Borough of Lambeth Once identified, designation and protection of the areas are done by local authorities through planning policies in their development plans. National government guidance (PPS 9) requires all development plans to include such policies. The variation in names for the designation reflects its separate existence in the different development plans for different areas. In some areas, the designation is subdivided, or additional, more local designations are also used. For example, in Greater London SINCs are divided into the following grades: * Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation * Site of Borough Importance for Nature Conservation (Grade I and Grade II) * Site of Local Importance for Nature Conservation See also *Site of Special Scientific Interest *Local nature reserve References External links * *Greenspace Information for Greater London, a database which covers most publicly accessible London SINCs * * Category:Nature reserves in the United Kingdom Category:Protected areas of the United Kingdom ","title":"Site of Nature Conservation Interest"},{"id":"4288535","text":"The Tagol Murut language is spoken by the Tagol (lowland) subgroup of the Murut people, and serves as the lingua franca of the whole group.

His father was a Baptist exhorter, working at trunk-making during the week and preaching on Sundays. The elder Peddie died in 1832, leaving his wife and six children in moderate financial circumstances and whose support then depended mainly upon Thomas. Seeing little chance in Scotland of earning a living for so many dependent ones, and hearing of America as the land of opportunity, he emigrated in 1833; after studying the advantages offered by several towns, he concluded to make Newark, New Jersey, his home. For two years he worked at the bench in a saddlery establishment and then, in a basement on Broad Street in Newark, began to manufacture trunks, not having, as he said, enough money to pay for the iron on his first trunk. When he died, his factory and warehouses covered nearly a block, his employees were numbered in the hundreds, and his name stood at the head of this branch of industry in the United States. Public affairs In addition to his public service described earlier, Peddie helped to found the Essex National Bank and was its vice president; he founded the Security Savings Bank and was its only president; he was president of the Board of Trade; manager of various city institutions; and director of insurance companies and charitable organizations. The money for the Newark First Baptist Church was given by Peddie. H. J.

While train speed optimization needs some technical infrastructure, it is more of an operational concept than a technical installation. One can relatively easily implement train speed optimization using for instance cab signalling (e.g. using ETCS), but the presence of a cab signalling system does not necessarily mean that it uses train speed optimization. Train speed optimization may also be implemented using conventional signalling. Conventional signal operation Usually, trains are allowed to run at the maximum speed the track allows until the distant signal of next occupied block. This is inefficient in many cases, because this way the train comes to a halt in front of the red signal and has to accelerate again from zero. Advantages using train speed optimization If the train slows down much earlier, given the right timing, it reaches the distant signal just when the home signal switches to green, and so does not need to stop. Thus, wear on the brakes is reduced and the train uses less energy. But the main reason, especially for trains that accelerate slowly, is that the train passes the home signal at high speed, compared to the conventional case where the train often has to accelerate from standstill. This effectively increases track capacity, because the time it takes for the train to run from the distant signal (that has just turned green) to the home signal is often much less than the time it takes for a train to accelerate from the home signal. Equipment For a train speed optimization system to work, it is necessary to have a signalling system which is capable of displaying several different speeds, for instance 40, 60, 90 km/h and the full line speed, which also requires a train protection system that is able to handle these cases (cab signalling may replace these installations). Further, the track must be equipped with inductive loops that detect the presence of trains with sufficient precision (or other means of detecting the positions of the trains). Finally a computer system is needed that is able to reasonably predict the movements of the trains for the next few minutes. Train speed optimization in practice The expensive and complicated installations usually only make sense for heavily used routes.

The company was formed in 1843 upon the demise of Sharp, Roberts & Co.. It moved to Glasgow, Scotland, in 1888, eventually amalgamating with two other Glasgow-based locomotive manufacturers to form the North British Locomotive Company. Early days Iron merchant Thomas Sharp and mechanical engineer Richard Roberts first formed a partnership, Sharp, Roberts & Co. (about which, see also company section in article on Roberts), to manufacture textile machinery and machine tools. They opened the Atlas Works in Manchester in 1828. They had built a few stationary steam engines, and in 1833 built a locomotive, Experiment for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. It was a four-wheeled 2-2-0 with vertical cylinders over the leading wheels. After a number of modifications, three similar locomotives (including Hibernia) were built in 1834 for the Dublin and Kingstown Railway. Although they were relatively fast, they were too hard on the track at speed. However, in 1834 Charles Beyer also joined the firm and contributed to its success in locomotive building as Roberts soon delegated most of the locomotive design work to him. A new 2-2-2 design was soon produced with horizontal inside cylinders under the smokebox and additional bearings to support the crank axle. Around 600 of these Sharp Single locomotives were built between 1837 and 1857. Ten of the first were sold to the Grand Junction Railway, with the \\"Sharpies\\" becoming a standard to compare with the \\"Bury\\" engines. Sharp Brothers and Company In 1843, Roberts left and the firm became Sharp Brothers and Company. Between 1846 and 1848 the company provided eight 2-2-2 passenger and two 0-4-2 goods locomotives to the Lynn and Dereham Railway. From 1851 to 1853 twenty engines were built for the London and North Western Railway to the design of James Edward McConnell, the so-called \\"Bloomers\\", subcontracted from Wolverton. Sharp, Stewart and Company Furness Railway No. 20. Works No. 1448 of 1863 In the station at the Leighton Buzzard Light Railway, Darjeeling Himalayan Railway class B No. 19 (778 under the all-India number scheme). Works No. 3518 of 1889 In 1852, the senior partner, John Sharp, retired and was replaced by Charles Patrick Stewart, the name of the company changing to Sharp Stewart and Company. Thomas Sharp also retired and was succeeded by Stephen Robinson. In 1860 sole rights were obtained for Giffard's patent injector. The company acquired limited liability in 1864. The company provided a number of 0-4-0 tender engines for the Furness Railway of which Number 20, built in 1863 has been restored to working order by the Lakeside & Haverthwaite Railway in Cumbria. In 1862, the company began making larger engines, first some 4-6-0 saddle tank engines for the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. By 1865 they were building 0-8-0s, again for India. Move to Glasgow Since they were also dealing in general brass and ironmongery, and machine tools, it became necessary to move, which they did in 1888. They took over and moved to the works of the Clyde Locomotive Company in Springburn, Glasgow, renaming it Atlas Works. A number of compounds were built for the Argentine Central Railway in 1889, some 4-4-0 and some 2-8-0. In 1892 they received an order for seventy five 4-4-0s and 0-6-0s from the Midland Railway. By now they had built a number of 4-6-0 engines for overseas railways, but in 1894 came their first Glasgow order for a British line, the \\"Jones Goods\\" of the Highland Railway. By the end of the century they were supplying railways at home and all over the world. Between 1898 and 1901, Sharp Stewart and Company supplied no less than 16 4-6-0 and 4 4-8-0 locomotives to New Zealand Railways. The 4-8-0 B class locomotives survived till the end of steam either as-built, or as 4-6-4T engines of the We class. The 4-6-0 locomotives were dumped in rivers and on the coast as erosion protection when their time was up. 3 have since been salvaged for preservation. North British In 1903, having built over 5000 engines, the company amalgamated with Neilson, Reid and Company and D√ºbs and Company to form the North British Locomotive Company.

He was regarded at the time as one of the best fast bowlers in England. Talents and limitations While Clark was playing for them, Northamptonshire was one of the weakest counties ever to play in the County Championship. Nonetheless, Clark was a bowler of genuine pace who could swing the ball in and make it break away to produce catches in the slips. He could also bowl, as Bill Voce did under Jardine, to a leg-side field, but was never as effective doing so. Like Voce, Clark often bowled round the wicket. At his best, \\"Nobby\\" Clark was the fastest professional bowler apart from Harold Larwood and his beautiful action enabled him to stand up to the considerable spells of work required of him given that Northamptonshire had little support in the field apart from Fred Bakewell at short leg. However, his fiery temperament ‚Äì he would get angry over even slight problems like broken footholds or missed chances ‚Äì greatly reduced Clark's appeal to selectors for Test and other representative matches. \\"Nobby\\"'s extreme weakness as a batsman further reduced his chances of competing with players who were much better bats and could bowl almost as well. Between July 1925 and June 1927 Clark played sixty-five innings without reaching double figures and he never made more than 30 in a first-class innings. Career Clark was born near Peterborough and first played for Northamptonshire as a teenager in 1922 after success in Yorkshire League cricket. He came to prominence in 1925, when he took eleven wickets in a surprise win over Kent and was in the top twenty of the national averages. Despite playing in the 1928 Test Trial, injury meant he was not seriously in contention for a place on the Ashes tour. In 1929, however, Clark recovered his form to miss 150 wickets by only one and play his first Test at Kennington Oval, where he was criticised for overdoing leg theory. The extreme financial difficulties faced by Northamptonshire ‚Äì at one point the club was poised to exit the first-class arena ‚Äì caused \\"Nobby\\" Clark to leave in July 1930 for league cricket. He returned to the county in 1932. Clark, in early 1933, bowled as fast and as well as he ever had done. In the first match against the touring West Indians he took ten for 61 and in his first six matches 52 wickets for 574 runs. However, after that he was affected by injury but he still took eleven wickets in his two Tests and was chosen for the first Test- playing tour of India that winter. Clark's 1934 season was again plagued by injury, but he was still regarded so highly that he played in two Tests against Australia. At Old Trafford he bowled well on one of the most docile of pitches but had no luck, but in the last Test at the Oval he took five for 98 including the valuable scalps of Brown, Ponsford, McCabe and Kippax. He also failed twice by the narrowest of margins to bowl Don Bradman. In 1935 Clark was bowling for a Northamptonshire side growing weaker and weaker by the year: they lost thirteen consecutive matches in the second half of the season, in several of which \\"Nobby\\"'s bowling gave them the upper hand only for feeble batting to ruin their advantage. He would have played in the Old Trafford Test against the South Africans but for yet another injury, but, though he bowled well in an unfavourably wet summer in 1936, his age was already making it hard to maintain speed beyond a few overs and he was never considered for a Test place. It was still a surprise, though, when Clark in 1937 declined so much apart from one haul of six for 29 against Essex that Northamptonshire, already so weak that they had not won any of their last 71 county matches, decided not to re-engage him. After the war in 1946, although he was forty-three, Northamptonshire surprisingly re-engaged \\"Nobby\\" and he showed himself still the fastest bowler for four or five overs in England. He was, however, quite naturally unable to bowl any long spell and consequently he did nothing exceptional. 1947 saw him play about half the matches before he retired for good as Northamptonshire's greatest-ever wicket-taker.

It is a regenerative device that converts chemical energy into motion through a direct noncombustive chemical reaction. Function RCM is capable of generating autonomic wing beating from a chemical energy source. It can also be used to provide a small amount of electricity to the onboard control systems. It further helps in differential lift enhancement on the wings to achieve roll, pitch, and hence, steered flight. The RCM technique is particularly useful in the manufacturing of insect-like micro air vehicles. The first generation of RCMs was large and had a reciprocating frequency around 10 Hz. The later generationshttp://angel- strike.com/wiki/index.php?title=File:RCM-Generations.jpg developed were very much smaller and lighter. Also, the reciprocating frequency of this generation RCM was as high as 60 Hz. The reciprocating chemical muscle was invented by Prof. Robert C. Michelson of the Georgia Tech Research Institute and implemented up through its fourth generation by Nino Amarena of ETS Laboratories. Benefits Particular benefits of the RCM are: *It requires no ignition source (thereby allowing it to work in explosive atmospheres). *It is independent of external oxidant (thereby allowing it to operate under water or in oxygen-free environments such as the lower atmosphere of the planet Mars). *It thermoelectrically generates electrical energy from its own exothermic metabolism. *It converts chemical potential energy directly into kinetic energy with greater energy density than batteries.Michelson, R.C., Novel Approaches to Miniature Flight Platforms, Proceedings of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers, Vol. 218 Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering, Special Issue Paper 2004, pp. 363‚Äì373 Mechanism The reciprocating chemical muscle uses various monopropellants in the presence of specific catalysts to create gas from a liquid without combustion.Colozza, A., Michelson, R.C., et al., Planetary Exploration Using Biomimetics ‚Äì An Entomopter for Flight on Mars, Phase II Final Report (see chapter on fuels), NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts Project NAS5-98051, October 2002. abstract This gas is used to drive reciprocating opposing cylinders (in the fourth-generation device) to produce sufficient motion (throw) with sufficient force and frequency to allow flapping-wing flight. As of 2004, the RCM had been demonstrated in the Georgia Tech Research Institute laboratory to achieve sufficient throw, force, and frequency for operation of a 50-gram entomopter while using high concentration (> 90%) hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a proprietary catalyst developed by ETS Laboratories.Michelson, R.C., Naqvi, M.A., Extraterrestrial Flight (Entomopter-based Mars Surveyor), von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics RTO/AVT Lecture Series on Low Reynolds Number Aerodynamics on Aircraft Including Applications in Emerging UAV Technology, Brussels Belgium, 24‚Äì28 November 2003 Specific uses The reciprocating chemical muscle was developed as a drive mechanism for the flapping wings of the entomopter. The RCM reuses energy many times before releasing it into its surroundings.Michelson, R.C., 'Neurotechnology for Biomimetic Robots, , The MIT Press, September 2002, pp. 481 ‚Äì 509, (chapter author) First, it converts mainly heat energy into flapping-wing motion in the entomopter. Then, heat is scavenged for thermoelectric generation in support of ancillary systems. Waste gas from the chemical decomposition of the fuel is then used to create a frequency modulated continuous wave acoustic ranging signal that is Doppler insensitive (used for obstacle avoidance). Waste gas is then passed through an ejector to entrain external atmospheric gases to increase mass flow and decrease waste gas temperature so that lower-temperature components can be used downstream. Some waste gas is diverted into gas bearings for rotational and linear moving components. Finally, remaining waste gas is vectored into the wings where it is used for circulation-controlled lift augmentation (Coanda effect). Any remaining gas can be used for vectored thrust, but if the gas budgets are correctly designed, there should be no extra gas beyond the circulation control points. The features of the RCM are tailored to the entomopter to conserve energy. References External links * Robert C.

They come in various sizes, numbers, shapes, pigments and can be free- floating, attached to the pupillary margin or within the posterior chamber. Most frequently iris cysts don't cause any issues, but they can cause problems like: ‚Äúfly biting‚Äù behavior, corneal endothelial pigment, lens capsular pigmentation, altered iris movement, decreased aqueous outflow with subsequent glaucoma or block the vision when grown to big. They can be acquired or innate. Possible causes are inflammation, drug-induced, uveitis, a trauma, tumor-induced, parasitic or implantation. Most frequently iris cysts are benign and need no treatment. Sometimes iris cysts are causing problems and need to be deflated. Iris cysts can be treated with trans corneal diode laser treatment, fine-needle aspiration or surgical excision. For the treatment of iris cysts is a conservative approach favored.  Introduction  Mackenzie diagnosed the first iris cyst in 1830, which was a posttraumatic iris cyst in the anterior chamber. Because of the wide variety of iris cysts, a categorization was needed. This categorization was proposed by Shields in 1981 and was based on 2 main groups: primary and secondary cyst. Primary cysts origin is neuroepithelial, and rarely causes any issue. Primary cysts can be subcategorized based on their location in the eye. However, secondary cysts can cause problems like decreased vision, secondary glaucoma, uveitis or corneal edema and origin from implantation, metastasis, miotics or parasites. Secondary cysts are further categorized based on their origin.  Brief overview of the anatomy of the iris  The iris is a thin circular structure in the eye which consists of two layers, on top is the stroma and underneath the pigmented epithelial cells. It separates the eye in the anterior and posterior chamber, is responsible for the eye's color, and its function is to regulate the size of the pupil. By controlling the size of the pupil it regulates the amount of light reaching the retina. Depending on the amount of light, the iris opens with high intensity light and closes with low intensity light. The iris is able to control the size of the pupil due to radial and circular muscles which attach to the stroma. The circular muscle, sphincter muscle, contracts in a circular motion, making the pupil smaller, but by contracting the radial muscles, dilator muscles, the pupil enlarges.  Primary cyst  The classification of primary cysts is according to the categorization of Shields. The origin of primary cysts is neuroepithelial. Primary cysts are rarely causing any problems, fluid-filled and have smooth surfaces. They are subcategorized according to their location in the eye. Pupillary cysts, also central cysts, are located from the pupillary margin to the iris root, midzonal cysts are located from the iris root to the ciliary body, and peripheral cysts are located at the iridociliary sulcus. Free- floating cysts can occur in the anterior and vitreous chamber and are usually dislodged epithelium cysts. Cysts of the iris stroma are anteriorly located and as they develop, they usually cause deformation of the iris and need treatment. Especially the congenital secondary cysts require often treatment. They are usually unilateral and solitary. Acquired secondary cysts, on the other hand, require very rarely treatment and often occur at a later age.  Secondary cyst  Secondary cysts are usually unilateral and solitary and have a smooth surface. Secondary cysts may obstruct the eye's vision, cause intraocular pressure or iris displacement. The categorization of secondary cysts is categorized according Shields categorization. Secondary cysts are classified into 6 subcategories. \\\\- Implantation cysts are the most common secondary cysts. They can originate from a surgical trauma or a penetrating wound. An invasion of conjunctival or corneal epithelial cells creates the cyst. \\\\- Drug-induced cysts are related with the use of miotics or latanoprost but can get smaller after stopping inducing the drug. \\\\- Uveitic cysts can arise when the eye is or has been inflamed. \\\\- Tumor-induced secondary cysts are caused by a tumor. \\\\- The rarest iris cyst is the parasitic cyst, which can develop with the presence of a parasite. \\\\- At last secondary cysts can be caused by a systematic disorder like: diabetes mellitus, Menkes syndrome or malignancies.  Diagnosis  Iris cyst must be differentiated from other kinds of possible ‚Äúbodies‚Äù in the eye. After the body has been established as an iris cyst, it must be categorized as primary or secondary. It is necessary to differentiate secondary cysts even further. Clinical examination can achieve this differentiation with the use of multimodal imaging techniques like UBM, ultrasound B-scan (USB), anterior segment optical coherence tomography (as-OCT) and magnetic resonance imaging.  Clinical presentation  Primary cysts come in various sizes and number but are usually fluid- filled, with regular borders and a smooth surface. The iris could be slightly displaced anteriorly because of a primary cyst, but normally no problems occur with primary cysts. Secondary cysts cause most of the times problems, and thus also need treatment. Secondary cysts usually have a rough surface, irregular borders, solitary and unilateral. Possible problems could be displacement of the iris, iritis and raised intraocular pressure. A clinician should also be able to tell the difference between a cyst and a tumor. The main differences are that cysts usually cause displacement or the iris whereas a tumor arises and grows into the iris stroma. In the presence of an intrinsic or sentinel vessel than you probably have to deal with a tumor. The last main difference can be shown with transillumination, since transillumination always creates a shadow with a tumor but almost never with a cyst.  Ultrasound B-scan (USB)  Ultrasound B-scan (USB) uses wavelengths of 10-20 MHz to form an image of the eye. USB can be used to identify the extension of the iris cyst in either the anterior or posterior chamber. It can also be used to identify midzonal cysts behind the iris and to determine whether there is ciliary body involvement. The preferred method to determine ciliary body involvement, however, is not USB but ultrasound biomicroscopy.  Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM)  Ultrasound biomicroscopy, (UBM) has a higher resolution than USB and it also uses soundwaves with a higher frequency from 50 to 100 MHz. UBM is used for the identification of thin ultrastructure's and for internal echogenicity of cysts. Due to the high resolution small cysts can easily be distinguished, multilocated cysts are easy to find and it is easier to determine whether the cyst is bilateral. The only disadvantage of UBM is its limited penetration. Despite this disadvantage, UBM is still the golden standard for the diagnosis of iris cysts.  Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT)  AS-OCT has the highest resolution of all diagnosis methods but it has a major disadvantage. AS-OCT creates a heavy shadowing caused by the iris pigment epithelium regarding iris lesions. AS-OCT is used to show the anterior border of an iris lesion. The internal structure of the cyst and what is behind the cyst, however, is not that clear due to heavy shadowing. That is why UBM is preferred over AS-OCT, the borders will be less visible but with UBM the whole structure of the cyst and the surrounding tissues is shown.  Fine-needle aspiration (FNA)  Fine-needle aspiration, FNA, is only used if every other method has failed to establish what kind of cyst it is and if it is presumably a solid tumor. FNA is used as a last diagnosis method because it is the most invasive method since the eye has to be penetrated with a needle. FNA has been very successful with differentiating tumors with cystic spaces, like melanomas, adenomas or metastatic tumors. FNA can also be used as a treatment.  Other ancillary procedures  MRI is not used as a diagnosis method by itself. It is more used as a method to gain some extra information about the cyst. Magnetic resonance imaging can establish very well whether the cyst is in contact or attached to the sclera or whether the cyst is a primary tumor.  Treatment options   Observation  The preferred treatment option is observation, since most iris cysts do not hurt or cause any pressure. A veterinarian however prefers to check the cyst from time to time to make sure that the cyst does not grow and does not cause any problems or pain. If the cyst is growing, causing pain or some issues over time, then the cyst will need another treatment.  Fine-needle aspiration  Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is, as discussed earlier, also a diagnosis method but can also be used as a treatment. With FNA a very fine needle is inserted in the eye in the cyst. The purpose of the needle is to penetrate the membrane of the cyst, so that the cyst will deflate. This method has proven to be successful but there is a possibility that the cyst will not disappear fully but only shrink. If the cyst has shrunk enough that it is not causing any pain or trouble anymore, then a second treatment might not be necessary. But if the cyst is still causing an issue after the treatment, the treatment must be repeated, or another method has to be used.  Intracystic injection of absolute alcohol  Intracystic injection of absolute alcohol has proven to be a very effective method. The alcohol gets injected in the cyst through a needle which is penetrating the eye from outside into the cyst. The injection of the alcohol regresses the cyst or will at least stabilize it. It can take a few weeks before the cyst has disappeared fully. A common side effect of this method is an inflammation in the anterior chamber, but this can easily be treated with topical steroids (cream or gel with anti-inflammatory properties).  Antimitotic agents  Antimitotic agents are used mainly when a cyst is resistant to all other treatments apart from surgery, since surgery is the last resort. Antimitotic agents are injected into the cyst and left inside for 5 minutes; after 5 minutes the agents are rinsed out. Antimitotic agents have the side effect of creating a small inflammation which can easily be treated with topical steroids. Antimitotic agents stop the mitose of the cells of the cyst by interfering with a particular phase of the cell cycle, which stops the cyst from growing and will eventually kill the cells and thus the cyst.  Laser therapy  Laser therapy is a treatment which has to be repeated several times. The treatment gets repeated every week until the cyst is gone. Despite not having the highest success rate it is nowadays the most preferred treatment against iris cyst because it is the least invasive method since the eye doesn't need to be punctured or cut. Two kinds of laser beams can be used for laser therapy: thermal (diode or argon laser) and Nd:YAG laser. Sometimes both methods are combined for a better result since thermal laser can harden the cyst and stop the intracystic fluid production and Nd:YAG can perforate the cyst membrane and drain the cyst.  Surgical  Surgery is considered to be the last resort because surgery has the highest chance at complications. The surgical approach depends on where the cyst is located, how big the cyst is and the number of cysts.  The stepwise minimally invasive strategy  There are many options when treating an iris cyst. Mentioned above are the most used treatments but in the past there have been other methods but they haven't been successful enough to be still used today. A clinician has to consider a lot of things when choosing a treatment. The golden rule when treating iris cysts however is to choose the least invasive method. That means that cysts which are not causing any problems wil not be treated but observed. The least invasive treatment is laser therapy and is, therefore, also the preferred method to treat an iris cyst. Depending on the kind of cyst, the clinician will choose either antimitotic agents or AS-OCT, if laser has failed or if laser is not possible. It is unlike that FNA will be used due to its low potential for removing the cyst. Surgery is the most invasive method and the one with the highest chance of complications. That is why surgery is the last resort.

The process involves lighting straw or torches near their roost. After awakening them from their roost, the birds fly toward the flames, where, being amazed, they are easily caught in nets, or beaten with bats. The phrase \\"beating about the bush\\" is said to be derived from this practice as the trapper's accomplices would go around the bushes to disturb the birds. The practice was also called lanciatoia in Italy and a variation was called low-belling. The low-belling process involves approaching birds with bright lights and using cow bells, which the birds were accustomed to, to approach the birds up close and capture them with a long-handled net.

The figure is primarily mute in person but voiced over the phone by Roger L. Jackson, regardless of who is behind the mask. Ghostface first appeared in Scream (1996) as a disguise used by teenagers Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) and Stu Macher (Matthew Lillard), during their killing spree in the fictional town of Woodsboro. Ghostface was created by screenwriter Kevin Williamson. The mask is inspired by The Scream painting by Edvard Munch and was created and designed by Fun World costume company employee Brigitte Sleiertin as a Halloween costume, prior to being discovered by Marianne Maddalena and Craven for the film. The identity is used primarily as a disguise for the antagonists of each film to conceal their identities while conducting serial murders, and as such has been portrayed by several actors. In the Scream universe, the costume is not unique and is easily obtainable, allowing others to wear a similar outfit. Ghostface often calls its targets to taunt or threaten them while using a voice changer that hides its true identity. In Scream 3, this is taken further by Roman Bridger (Scott Foley) who uses a device that enables him to sound like several other characters, in order to manipulate targets. The changing identity of the person beneath the mask means that Ghostface has no definite motivation, ranging from revenge and seeking fame to \\"peer pressure\\". However, each killer shares the common goal of killing Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) due to a chain of events indirectly caused by her mother Maureen (Lynn McRee); Billy and Stu created the identity in the first place to exact revenge on Sidney because of her mother's affair with Billy's father. The Ghostface persona remains the same throughout the Scream series, featuring a black hood and cloak with a jagged base and a white rubber-mask resembling a ghost with a screaming expression. Though each iteration of Ghostface is human, it often exhibits extreme durability against physical harm, high levels of physical strength, and an almost supernatural stealth ability; able to appear and disappear in seemingly impossible situations. The character has often appeared in popular culture since its inception, referenced in film and television as well as spawning a series of action figures and merchandise. In the anthology television series Scream, two different characters are similar to Ghostface, named the Lakewood Slasher, who appeared in the series for the first two seasons and the Shallow Grove Slasher, who appeared in the Halloween special episodes of the second season, both are voiced by Mike Vaughn. On September 18, 2017, it was announced that Ghostface would make an appearance in the third season. On October 10, 2017, Keke Palmer confirmed in an interview that Roger L. Jackson the original voice of Ghostface in the film series, would return for the third season, replacing Vaughn. The third season premiered on July 8, 2019. Appearances  Films  Ghostface first appears in the opening scene of Scream (1996). The character, voiced by Roger L. Jackson, calls and taunts teenager Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) with horror clich√©s and trivia questions, eventually murdering her boyfriend Steve Orth (Kevin Patrick Walls) in front of her before she herself is killed. The identity has been adopted by the primary antagonists of each successive film to conceal their identities, prior to being revealed in each film's final act. Stu Macher (left) and Billy Loomis (right), the original Ghostface killers. In the original Scream, the identity is used by a killer stalking the fictional town of Woodsboro, California. After the murder spree begins, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) begins receiving taunting and threatening phone calls from Ghostface, who claims knowledge of her mother Maureen Prescott (Lynn McRee)'s brutal murder, one year prior to the events of the film, a murder that was blamed on Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber). The Ghostface disguise allows suspicion to fall on many people, including Sidney's boyfriend, Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich); her father, Neil Prescott (Lawrence Hecht); her friend, Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy); and her schoolmate, Stu Macher (Matthew Lillard). Ghostface is revealed in the finale as both Billy and Stu, who reveal that they murdered Sidney's mother and framed Cotton. Billy cites his motivation as abandonment by his mother (Laurie Metcalf), brought about by his father's affair with Maureen, while Stu cites \\"peer pressure\\". Sidney is able to gain an advantage against Billy and Stu, temporarily adopting the Ghostface persona herself to taunt them before killing Stu. Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) shoots Billy to stop him from killing Sidney, who then finishes Billy off with a bullet to the head, citing the fact that \\"They ALWAYS come back,\\" a common horror cliche, and now her catchphrase. This is most likely one of the many tropes taught to her by Randy Meeks, who is obsessed with horror, and openly lists these cliches earlier in the film, during a party. Ghostface's second appearance was in Scream 2 (1997) where it was again used as a disguise by the main antagonists. A series of murders occur at Windsor College, Sidney's current location, with the initial victims sharing names with Billy and Stu's victims from Scream. The killers again taunt Sidney and attempt to kill her and later kill Randy. The Ghostface disguise allows suspicion to fall on several characters, including Cotton, again, and Sidney's boyfriend Derek (Jerry O'Connell). However, Mickey (Timothy Olyphant), a friend of Derek, reveals himself as the killer, seeking fame for his prolific exploits. Mickey's accomplice is revealed to be Billy's mother, under the alias Debbie Salt, who is seeking revenge against Sidney for her son's death. Mrs. Loomis shoots Mickey, claiming to have indulged his desire for fame only to enlist his help in enacting her revenge, and tries to kill Sidney. Cotton comes to Sidney's aid, shooting Mrs. Loomis in the chest Seconds later, Mickey springs to his feet screaming, but is quickly shot to death by Gale and Sidney. Sidney then shoots Mrs Loomis in the head. In Scream 3 (2000), a new Ghostface killer murders Cotton and his girlfriend Christine, in an attempt to discover the now-hidden Sidney's location. The killer leaves images of Maureen at the crime scenes to draw Sidney out of seclusion while murdering the cast of \\"Stab 3\\", the film within a film based on Sidney and her experiences with Ghostface. Ghostface is revealed as Sidney's half-brother Roman Bridger (Scott Foley), born to their mother Maureen during a two-year period when she moved to Hollywood to become an actress under the name Rina Reynolds. After being gang- raped and impregnated at a party, she gave Roman up for adoption who sought her out years later, only to be rejected, telling him that he's Rina's child. Roman began stalking Maureen and filming her relationships with other men including Hank Loomis. He used this footage to reveal to Billy why his mother had \\"abandoned\\" him before convincing him to kill Maureen, sparking the chain of events in Scream and Scream 2. With Sidney's help, her friend Dewey Riley (David Arquette) manages to kill Roman, ending the series of murders based on his revenge against Maureen. In Scream 4 (2011), another Ghostface killer emerges in Woodsboro on the 15th anniversary of the massacre conducted by Billy and Stu; the new killer recreates events from the incident, but also films the murders to create a snuff film. Ghostface kills several teenagers and police officers before being unmasked as Sidney's cousin Jill Roberts (Emma Roberts) and her friend Charlie Walker (Rory Culkin) who intend to kill Sidney, frame Jill's ex-boyfriend Trevor Shelton (Nico Tortorella) and become the current generation's \\"Sidney\\" and \\"Randy Meeks\\", with the accompanying fame of being the \\"survivors\\" of the massacre. Jill betrays Charlie and stabs him through the heart and then seemingly kills Sidney, before purposely injuring and stabbing herself to make herself appear a victim of Ghostface. After being taken to the hospital, Dewey informs her that Sidney has survived. Jill attempts to end her life but is stalled by Dewey, Gale and Judy Hicks (Marley Shelton) long enough for Sidney to shoot her through the heart, killing her. Ghostface will be making an appearance in the fifth installment of the Scream franchise.  Television series  Ghostface made an appearance in the third season of the anthology television slasher series Scream. The season, titled Scream: Resurrection, premiered on VH1 on July 8, 2019. In this season, the killers are revealed in the episode \\"Endgame\\": Beth (Giorgia Whigham) and Jamal \\"Jay\\" Elliot (Tyga).  Video games  Ghostface is featured as a killer in the asymmetrical multiplayer survival horror game, Dead by Daylight. He was added in the Ghost Face DLC released on June 18, 2019, under the alias \\"The Ghost Face.\\"Scream's Ghostface is Dead by Daylight's next killer, Polygon, Goslin, Austen, 29/5/19 In the game, Ghostface's real identity is Danny Johnson, known by the pseudonym Jed Olsen, a narcissistic freelancer newspaper journalist in the fictional town of Roseville, Florida who covers the Ghostface murders by day and commits them by night. This version of Ghostface is an original character who was created exclusively for the game and has no relation to the Scream franchise. This is because the developers were only able to accquire the license for the Scream mask, which is separate from the one for the character, as the films used a pre-existing mask.Danny \\"Jed Olsen\\" Johnson - Official Dead by Daylight Wiki Concept and creation mold for the Ghostface mask based on Fun World's design but with significant differences, including more pronounced features, in order to avoid copyright issues. The Ghostface costume is the outfit worn by the main antagonists of the Scream franchise, consisting of a rubber white mask with black eyes, nose and mouth and a black, cloth-like material, hooded- robe with faux-tatters draping from the arms and a spiked-trim to the base of the outfit. In the movie, the costume is considered common and easily purchasable making identifying the buyers difficult and creating the possibility for anyone to be the killer. The Ghostface mask was first developed for novelty stores during the Halloween season between 1991 and 1992 by Fun World employee Brigitte Sleiertin as part of a series entitled \\"Fantastic Faces\\", the mask itself known as \\"The Peanut-Eyed Ghost\\". The final design was approved by Fun World vice-President Allan Geller. Craven claimed to have originally found the mask but later clarified that he had misremembered the event and that it was producer Marianne Maddalena who discovered it. She found it while inside a house during location scouting for the film and brought it to the attention of Craven, who set about trying to obtain the rights to use it. Fun World Licensing Director R.J. Torbert joined Fun World in 1996 and was given the task of naming the mask prior to its film debut, deciding on \\"GhostFace\\" with the blessing of Fun World owners Stanley and Allan Geller. Torbert felt it looked like a \\"ghost in pain\\", believing it to be a unique design. The Ghostface design and title are owned by Fun World. The design of the mask bears reference to Edvard Munch's painting The Scream, one of the characters on the cover of the Pink Floyd album The Wall and the ghostly characters that appeared in the 1930s Betty Boop cartoon. The mask is stark white and depicts a caricature of someone screaming and crying at the same time. Designer Sleiertin stated that the mask displayed different emotions, \\"It's a horrible look, it's a sorry look, it's a frantic look\\". Since the appearance of Ghostface in Scream, the costume has become the most worn and sold costume for Halloween in the United States. The initial script labeled the main antagonist as \\"masked killer\\" with no specifications to its appearance, forcing Craven and his staff to produce the costume eventually worn by Ghostface as they were shooting. Craven asked Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger of design company KNB Effects to produce a mask specifically for the film based on the Fun World design but did not like the final result. After Fun World and Dimension Films were able to complete an agreement for the use of the Ghostface mask, Craven was able to use the original design as he wanted. The custom mask made by KNB Effects still appears in the scenes involving the murder of Casey Becker and Principal Himbry as filming of these scenes completed prior to the finalization of the deal between Fun World and Dimension Films. The Ghostface masks as seen in (top left-bottom right) Scream, Scream 2, Scream 3 and Scream 4. The 1991‚Äì92 \\"Fantastic Faces\\" edition of the mask used in Scream is made of thin, white rubber with blackened eyes, nose and mouth. Despite being portrayed by Ulrich and Lillard, the costume is mostly worn by stuntman Dane Farwell born 1957 and who gave the character many of its mannerisms including the ritualistic cleaning of the knife blade following a kill. In the first film, Craven wore the costume during the opening murder scene where the character is struck by a phone and by Ulrich only once during a finale scene where the character prepares to murder Randy. Despite Stu wearing the costume in the film, actor Lillard never actually wore the outfit. Scream 2 features a slightly redesigned version of the mask from the \\"Fearsome Faces\\" line, possessing slightly-altered eyes and an indented chin. Following Scream 2, the Ghostface mask became part of the \\"Ghostface\\" line of masks featuring several variations of the design including glow-in- the-dark models. The plain, white version of the Ghostface line mask is used in Scream 3 by Bridger. Another edition of the mask was developed, dubbed \\"The Deluxe Edition Mask\\" for use by Ghostface in Scream 4, again similar to the original Ghostface design but constructed of thicker rubber with a pearlescent finish. Following the description in Williamson's script of a \\"ghost mask\\", Craven and designers had originally intended to use a white-motif, creating a white cloak and hood for the killer's costume. It was the intervention of Maddalena who felt that the cloak would be scarier if it was black, that resulted in the dark costume shown on screen. The cloak itself had to be custom-made for the film as the \\"Father Death\\" outfit identified in Scream as that of the killers did not really exist, as the Fun World mask was sold only as a stand-alone item. The cloak entered into retail markets only following the release of Scream. Each cloak was estimated to cost $700 to hand-produce by a seamstress and was made of a heavy, thick, black material with reflective threads woven throughout, creating a subtle glimmer. The cloak was created to help conceal the identity of the killers by covering most of their visible bodies, as it was believed that otherwise audiences would be able to guess which character was involved by his or her clothing and body-shape. The knife used by Ghostface in the films is a custom prop knife based on the Buck 120 Hunting Knife that has since been discontinued by Buck. The knife blades are made of aluminium or chrome-paint-coated plastic with a rubber handle depending on the scenario for which they are needed. The handle is black with a silver, metal-appearance for the tip. The Buck 120 knife was chosen as the model for the Ghostface weapon because of the large blade it features, though the Buck 120 itself was discontinued due to customer complaints that the blade length was deemed \\"too big\\" for gutting animals. Characterization Ghostface is rarely depicted as speaking while physically on screen, in order to aid in concealing the identity of the character behind the mask. Exceptions to this are grunts and groans when injured, which are dubbed into the film during the editing phase by Jackson. Ghostface only speaks physically on screen on two occasions in the series; on those two occasions, it is just before his true identity is revealed. The voice given to the character, provided by Jackson, is used when talking to another character over the phone or to display the use of the voice changer when the killer reveals himself. Despite being portrayed by different characters in each film, Ghostface displays similar personality and physical attributes regardless of who is wearing the costume or speaking to a target, such as taunting his victims over the telephone, the ritualistic cleaning of his knife after a kill, slashing the throat of his victims before killing them by stabbing, almost superhuman strength and durability, and grunts and groans when injured. Ghostface is never referred to by its name until Scream 4, simply called \\"The Killer\\" and \\"Father Death\\" in the original Scream, while being credited as \\"The Voice\\" in the credits. The name originates from one character Tatum Riley played by Rose McGowan who called a disguised Billy Loomis \\"Mr. Ghostface\\" in the first movie prior to her death, in a sarcastic manner. Ghostface is often shown to taunt his targets, initially representing himself as charming and even flirtatious when speaking. His conversations turn confrontational and intimidating, using his knowledge of other characters or graphically describing his intentions before appearing to the target physically. Craven considers Jackson's voice performance as Ghostface to have \\"evil sophistication\\". When confronting his intended victim, Ghostface is portrayed in varying ways, sometimes quick and efficient and other times clumsy, falling, or colliding with objects that hinder his pursuit, a characteristic that varies based upon who is wearing the costume. Whoever inhabits the costume, Ghostface taunts its victims and prolongs a kill when it appears to have an advantage. The Billy/Stu Ghostface would gut its victims after killing them; this was not performed on Tatum Riley (Rose McGowan) who was killed in a mechanical garage door. This Ghostface in particular would ask its victim questions about horror films and employ the tropes of the genre in its attacks, displaying a detachment from reality and aligned with the same self-awareness of the film itself which toys with the expectations of the horror genre.Casey: Who's there?. Ghostface: Never say who's there? Don't you watch scary movies? It's a death wish. You might as well come out to investigate a strange noise or something. Sidney Prescott: But this is NOT a movie. Billy: Yes it is, Sidney. It's all one big movie. The second Ghostface, created by Mickey and Mrs. Loomis, would repeatedly stab its victim to death but often in a public place or with witnesses. The third Ghostface, created by Roman, preferred more clean kills with precise stabbings, and used theatricality and movie props to attack his victims, using a voice changer that allowed him to sound like many other people, casting suspicion and doubt on other characters. In addition, he would use images and the synthesized voice of Maureen to specifically taunt Sidney, even shrouding himself in a bloodied, crime scene cover, alluding to the murder of Maureen, to fool Sidney into believing that she was losing her sanity. The fourth Ghostface, created by Jill and Charlie, filmed each murder on web cameras hidden around the environment and spy cameras in its mask. Charlie mostly repeatedly stabbed his victims to death in a more vicious and brutal fashion, and would go further and gut them if he wanted, while Jill mostly stabbed only once. The two killers also made some of the murders public to gain the attention of the world press. The motivations for Ghostface's killing vary in each film and are respective to each killer wearing the costume. Billy claimed to have been driven to insanity by his mother's abandonment, an incident he blamed on Maureen, and after taking his revenge on her chose to continue his spree, leading towards her daughter Sidney, while Stu Macher lists peer pressure as his motivation. In Scream 2, Mrs. Loomis cites her motivation as simple revenge against the person she holds responsible for her son's death, while Mickey desires the fame that his involvement in the killings will garner when he is caught. In Scream 3, Roman seeks revenge for what he sees as his mother's rejection and abandonment by engineering Maureen's death and trying to kill Sidney, seeing her as having the family-life he was denied. In Scream 4, Jill, jealous of Sidney, wished to obtain similar fame as the sole survivor of a new massacre, while Charlie aided her both for those reasons and his love for Jill. In costume, the Ghostfaces share a ritualistic mannerism of gripping the blade of its knife between thumb and forefinger and wiping it clean of any blood following a murder by drawing its hand from handle to the tip of the knife. This characteristic was given to the character by stuntman Dane Farwell who wore the costume for many of its scenes in Scream. Each killer is depicted as possessing effective physical abilities, such as the capabilities of nearly flawless stealth, prowling without being detected, moving silently, and efficiently vanishing from its targets' defense. Additionally, the killer tends to display sufficient strength that allows them to overpower victims, such as in Scream 2, in regards to defeating two trained detectives single- handedly. Ghostface is shown to be able to sustain and even ignore severe levels of physical damage, surviving blunt trauma, stabbing wounds and gunshots. Billy, Mickey, Roman, and Jill all had to be shot through the head or multiple times to the chest to be killed, despite having sustained severe injuries prior. Cultural impact 2011 Ghostface figurine by NECA toys for Scream 4, displaying the full-length robe worn by the character. McFarlane Toys produced a 6-inch figurine of Ghostface in 1999 for the \\"Movie Maniacs II\\" series of horror and science fiction inspired line of character models. A series of figures were produced by NECA for Scream 4 featuring the standard mask and black cowl plus variations such as \\"Zombie Ghostface\\" with a decayed appearance on the mask and \\"Scarecrow Ghostface\\" with brown, burlap material used for the mask and clothing. Ghostface has been parodied and referenced numerous times in media following his appearance in the Scream franchise, most prominently in the parody film Scary Movie (2000) where a killer dressed as Ghostface commits a series of murders. However, unlike the original film, the killer is revealed to be single person as opposed to multiple; this parodic version of Ghostface later appears in the June 1, 2016 Erma comic strip, named \\"Prank Call\\", wherein the character is making prank calls whilst quoting Scream, alongside the series' titular character.Erma - Prank Call In the parody film Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th (2000), a killer wearing a Jason Voorhees-style hockey mask is set on fire, his mask melting to resemble that of Ghostface. The film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001) features Ghostface, as Shannen Doherty and Craven provide cameos as themselves making the then non-existent Scream 4, but Doherty objects when Ghostface turns out to be played by the orangutan, Suzann. As in film, Ghostface has been referenced repeatedly in various television programs and commercials. In the same year as the release of Scream 3, the mask made an appearance on Beverly Hills, 90210 and the Nickelodeon series Cousin Skeeter. It was also used as an ornament in the bedroom of the character Dawson in Dawson's Creek, a show created by Scream writer, Williamson. The character appears in a 1999 episode of Celebrity Deathmatch entitled \\"The Unknown Murderer\\", where he threatens to kill a scream queen every round, murdering Barrymore, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Jennifer Love Hewitt before planting his cell phone on a platypus to frame him, causing Campbell and Sarah Michelle Gellar to fight it. The mask was later used in The Sopranos episode \\"Fortunate Son\\" (2001) where it is worn by the character Christopher to commit a robbery. The costume is referenced in an episode of the television series Boomtown entitled \\"All Hallow's Eve\\" (2002) where a police officer uses the costume to frighten a bully who has been terrorizing other kids. In the Japanese anime FLCL episode \\"Marquis de Cabras\\" (2003), protagonist Naota's face changes to resemble that of Ghostface frequently during a scene where he and his family are eating spicy curry. The character makes a cameo appearance in Tripping the Rift in the episode \\"The Devil and a Guy Named Webster\\" (2004) as the judge when Chode sells his soul to the devil and finds a way to sue him. He also appears in a 2004 advert for Trivial Pursuit: '90s edition; representing iconic characters of the 1990s alongside Dennis Rodman and the character Rose from the 1997 film Titanic. A parody of Ghostface appears in the television series All Grown Up! episode \\"Interview with a Campfire\\" (2004) where Lil DeVille is taunted by phone and stalked by a character wearing an Easter Bunny mask. The character appears briefly in The Simpsons episode \\"Home Away from Homer\\" (2005) where Homer Simpson suggests him as a babysitter for his daughter Maggie Simpson. Roger L. Jackson lends his voice to Ghostface in the Robot Chicken episode \\"That Hurts Me\\" (2005) alongside other famous film killers in a show that parodies Big Brother, launching a prank war against Pinhead and Freddy Krueger before giving a speech to save himself from elimination from the show. He is referenced by Kenny Powers, the main character of Eastbound & Down who requests to wear the mask while having sex. In Scream XXX: A porn parody, a new Ghostface (wearing a clown variant of the Father Death mask) begins murdering the cast and crew of an in-production pornographic parody of the Stab series. In his book Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film, Adam Rockoff opined that Ghostface's mask was a \\"striking, surreal and downright terrifying presence\\". Calling the mask a \\"hyperbolic rendering\\" of Edvard Munch's The Scream, Rockoff wrote that the face is \\"twisted in an exaggerated, almost mocking grin, as if reflecting the look of terror and surprise on his victims' faces.\\" Tony Magistrale also discussed the similarities between Ghostface's mask and The Scream in his book Abject Terrors: Surveying the Modern and Postmodern Horror Film, stating that the painting, \\"an apt representation of the degree of alienation from other people, inspires the killers' murderous agenda\\".

The program was produced by American filmmakers Ken Burns and Lynn Novick, written by Geoffrey Ward, and narrated primarily by Keith David.The War  Pbs It premiered on September 23, 2007. The world premiere of the series took place at the Palace Theater in Luverne, Minnesota, one of the towns featured in the documentary. It was funded in part by the National Endowment for the Humanities. Content The series focuses on World War II in a \\"bottom up\\" fashion through the lenses of four \\"quintessentially American towns\\": *Luverne, Minnesota *Mobile, Alabama *Sacramento, California *Waterbury, Connecticut The series recounts the experiences of a number of individuals from these communities as they move through the war in the Pacific, African and European theaters, and focuses on the effect of the war on them, their families and their communities. A number of notable actors including Adam Arkin, Tom Hanks, Keith David, Samuel L. Jackson, Josh Lucas, Bobby Cannavale and Eli Wallach are heard as voice actors reading contemporary newspaper articles, telegrams, letters from the front, etc. Notable persons including Daniel Inouye, Sidney Phillips, Joe Medicine Crow and Paul Fussell were interviewed. The full documentary runs 14 hours and was broadcast in seven parts on PBS over two weeks, starting on Sunday, September 23, 2007 and continuing four nights the first week and three nights the second week, from 8 to 10 p.m. (8 to 10:30 p.m. on three nights). The documentary was provided to PBS affiliates in two versions: One with profanity generally prohibited by FCC regulations (including explanations of the acronyms FUBAR and SNAFU) and one without the expletives.

The region 4 DVD release of The War splits the series into 14 episodes, but notes that it is \\"a seven-part documentary\\". Critical reception TIME magazine's James Poniewozik named the series one of the Top 10 New TV Series of 2007, ranking it at no. 9.Poniewozik, James; Top 10 New TV Series; time.com Alessandra Stanley, writing for the New York Times, gave the series a mixed review, praising it as a \\"respectful, moving and meticulously illustrated anthology of small-town lives turned upside down by what one elderly veteran calls 'a necessary war,'\\" while also faulting it for \\"view[ing] the Second World War as a mostly domestic concern\\" in which \\"the London blitz, Stalingrad, Bergen-Belsen and the Warsaw uprising are parentheses.\\" Slate's Beverly Gage echoed these thoughts saying \\"it's rousing and meaningful and not technically inaccurate, but not exactly the whole truth.\\" Jonathan Storm of The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote, \\"Once-in-a-lifetime viewing.\\" Controversy The War came under fire after previews during the editing process indicated no mention of the contributions of Hispanics to the war effort, whose representation in the war itself is estimated at up to half a million people; complaints followed later as to omissions of Hispanic and Native American contributions and those of women in uniform. Originally the premiere was scheduled for September 16, 2007; the fact that this date is both Mexican Independence Day and the start of U.S. observance of National Hispanic Heritage Month drew additional fire from its detractors, and the initial airdate was later moved to September 23, 2007, with no comment from PBS. Although at first the dispute seemed to be settled with the inclusion of additional footage to address the omission, in subsequent weeks, groups began to question conflicting reports from Burns and PBS as to whether the additional footage would be provided as supplementary material or would be integrated into the overall program. Burns initially insisted that re-editing the series was out of the question, with PBS defending that decision on the basis of artistic freedom. Over the months of May and June, as of mid-July, 2007, estimates put out by Burns suggested that additional footage showing interviews with two Hispanics and one Native American would be added to the series, for a total of 28 minutes additional footage to the 14 hours the program was originally planned to cover; the additional footage would air at the conclusion of the selected episodes, but before each episode's final credits. News outlets began to report as of July 11 that the additional content had not been included in materials made available for preview by television writers and critics, prompting renewed discussion and speculation as to the eventual outcome of the debate.

Vitt later became manager of the Cleveland Indians (1938‚Äì1940), where he sometimes clashed with his players. Playing career Ossie Vitt was a product of the sandlots of San Francisco. He broke into the Pacific Coast League as third baseman for the San Francisco Seals in 1911. He later advanced to the majors as a utility infielder for the Detroit Tigers. Through his major league career, Vitt played 833 games at 3rd base and 161 games at 2nd base. As the Tigers' regular third baseman from 1915 through 1917, he never batted higher than .254. But he was described as a smart, scrappy baseball man. Vitt in 1910 Vitt had a career batting average of .238, and was a talented third baseman with range and a good throwing arm. His .960 fielding average in 10 years at 3rd base was 20 points higher than the Major League average for 3rd basemen of his era. He led all American League third basemen in consecutive years (1915 and 1916) in putouts, assists and fielding percentage. He had career highs at third base of 208 putouts (team record at 3B), 385 assists, and 32 double plays in 1916. His range factor of 3.93 in 1916 was 70 points higher than the league average for third basemen. While not a good hitter for average, Vitt was a good contact hitter and one of the best bunters of the era‚Äîa valuable talent on a Detroit squad that included Ty Cobb, Sam Crawford, and Bobby Veach. His career total of 259 sacrifice hits (in a relatively short career) ranks 32nd best in major league history. Vitt was also one of the toughest players to strike out in MLB history. For his career, he struck out an average of once every 26.6 at bats, 35th best in MLB history. In 1918, his at bat per strikeout ratio was 44.5, 2nd best in the AL. On August 10, 1915, Vitt was hit in the head by a Walter Johnson fastball. After being knocked unconscious for five minutes‚Äö Vitt left the game with a concussion. Ty Cobb‚Äö observing Johnson's fear of hitting a batter‚Äö crowded the plate on Johnson from that point forward. Cobb hit .435 against Johnson after the Vitt incident.The Ballplayers - Ossie Vitt From baseballlibrary.com. On July 30, 1917, Cobb‚Äö Veach‚Äö and Vitt followed each other in the lineup‚Äö with each going 5-for-5. On January 17, 1919, Vitt was traded by the Tigers to the Boston Red Sox for Eddie Ainsmith, Chick Shorten, and Slim Love. Managerial Career and the \\"Cleveland Crybabies\\" After playing in the majors for 10 years, Vitt was recommended to Oakland Oaks' owner Victor Devincinzi by the Yankees' management to manage the Oaks in 1935. His style was described as both abrasive and motivational, pushing the Oaks to a third-place finish. Vitt moved on in the Yankees' organization the next year, managing their farm team in Newark. He was then hired by the Cleveland Indians in 1938 to replace Steve O'Neil as manager and instill new life into their team. Vitt's role in the 1940 Cleveland Indians team known as the \\"Cleveland Crybabies\\" has become a baseball legend. \\"I don't want any lazy players on my club,\\" said Vitt when he was hired. \\"If the boys won't hustle, out they go.\\" Vitt's players felt they were being accused. In Vitt's first two seasons in Cleveland, the Indians finished third. Yet, there were frequent clashes between Vitt and his players, and the discontent festered. On June 11, 1940, matters came to a head when he went to the mound to remove Mel Harder. \\"When are you going to start earning your salary?\\" asked Vitt of Harder, who had won at least 15 games for eight consecutive seasons, including two 20-win seasons. The team revolted, and many players signed a petition to have Vitt removed. After the incident with Harder, a dozen Indians met with owner Alva Bradley to state their grievances against Vitt, whom they described as a \\"wild man.\\" They made it clear they hoped he would be fired. In the closed-door meeting between Indians players and owner, Harder told Bradley: \\"We think we have a good chance to win the pennant, but we'll never win it with Vitt as manager. If we can get rid of him, we can win. We feel sure about that.\\" Bradley sought to keep the controversy quiet, but the story quickly got out, and newspaper headlines all over the nation referred gleefully to the Indians as the \\"Cleveland Crybabies.\\" Despite the hullabaloo and ridicule, the Indians, with Vitt hanging on to his job, battled the Detroit Tigers for the pennant to the last day of the 1940 season. Through June, the Indians were 42‚Äì25. After June, with the \\"Crybabies\\" harangue clanging in the papers and from the stands, they went 47‚Äì40, not a collapse, but not good enough to stay ahead of the Tigers who won the pennant by a single game over the Tribe. Bob Feller, a 27-game winner that year, lost the decisive game 2‚Äì0. PCL Hall of Fame Vitt was among those in the first class of inductees in 1943 in the Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame.
