Erected in 1973, the monument is on a promontory named Miner‚Äôs Hill, located above Mitrovica, Kosovo. Its creator was architect Bogdan Bogdanovich.  History The idea of building the monument was put forward in 1959 on the day of the 20th anniversary of the Trepch miners' strike. The monument preserves the memory of local partisan fighters of Serbian and Albanian nationalities who formed a partisan mountain company, which fought against the occupying Axis forces, and local collaborators. The monument is currently not protected by any law, but is in more or less good condition. , restoration work is underway. Architecture The 19-meter-high monument resembles a trilithon consisting of three elements: two conical columns and a grooved structure. The sides of the gutter were originally coated with copper, with small decorative elements at each of the four corners. The columns are said to represent the two peoples of Kosovo through their unity during the anti-fascist struggle. Another definition states that the monument is similar to vans carrying ore from a mine to a metallurgical plant. A large number of bronze plaques are installed at the base of the monument, as well as two symbolic cenotaphs: one in front and one behind the monument. The cenotaph in front of the monument consists of four white tombstones with the names of the killed Albanian and Serbian partisans. The inscriptions are written in Albanian, Serbian, and Latin. The back cenotaph is the same, only nothing is written on it. The lower part of the columns is covered with graffiti, and most of the copper plates on the sides of the gutters fell off over time due to lack of maintenance and weather conditions.

Williams worked in Wallsend as a driller in a shipyard. He joined the Ship Constructive and Shipwrights' Association during World War I. In 1940, he began working full- time for the union, and also won election to its executive committee. In 1948, the union's assistant general secretary, John Willcocks, was elected as general secretary, and Williams won the election to become his assistant. In 1957, when Willcocks retired, Williams overwhelmingly won the election to replace him, taking 3,997 votes, while his four opponents took fewer than 1,000 votes between them. As general secretary, Williams immediately led the union in a Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions strike, calling for an increase in wages. This was successful, although the increase was smaller than requested. Employment in the shipyards was in decline, and the union's membership also fell. This led Williams to agree to agree to a Trades Union Congress proposal that the union merge into the United Society of Boilermakers, Shipbuilders and Structural Workers. He remained secretary of the union's new shipwrights section until his retirement, at the end of 1964.

History  Paul Nolan, the founding publisher of The Acton Tanner, began publishing at 7 Mill Street East in downtown Acton, moving to 12 Church Street East within two years. Nolan‚Äôs family came from Glendalough in County Wicklow, Ireland, and Paul had an early taste of newspaper fame. The future publisher had appearances in the Acton Free Press in 1969 on his first day of school, and in 1972 for winning prizes at two fairs. A high school valedictorian, by 18 he was a Sports section editor of the Free Press. Two years later in 1985 he was publishing the weekly Acton Voice, and purchased The Standardbred News in 1988, a biweekly journal for harness horseracing and breeding. For the first three weeks of its existence the Acton Tanner was distributed freely to residents, its colourful masthead a bright blue that would rotate with other eye-catching colours over time. A Tuesday publishing schedule soon became Wednesdays, charging 60 cents for a 16-20 page issue or $26.40 per annum. Local events would be filed under The Grape Vine, and Constable [Bill] Riddle‚Äôs Corner featured safety tips, later being written by Constable Gerry George. Nolan himself wrote many articles, along with Frances Niblock as editor and Pat Giguere covering a seniors column. A paper-within-a-paper would appear as well, the Rockwood Miller. The Tanner gave more focus to local Acton information, with Nolan going so far as to butt heads with the Acton town council members. He felt the awarding of the annual advertising contract to The Georgetown Independent-Acton Free Press was ‚Äúflawed in its logic‚Äù, and the council should be supporting the community newspaper, more widely read by locals than the broader, merged papers. There was chafing at the lumping in of Acton with Georgetown. Nolan‚Äôs editorials ranged from congratulating local sports teams, himself an avid soccer and hockey player, to calling out suspicious political dealings. This included a scathing article on Halton North N.D.P. MPP Noel Duignan, and his alleged ‚Äúeight-page propaganda piece, camouflaged as a hometown tabloid newspaper, and promoting itself as the newsletter of the community.‚Äù The Tanner had been suffering financial troubles due to delinquent payments by advertisers, leading to a six month shutdown of the paper in May 1997. The New Tanner would be up and running on January 29, 1998, from the old Dills (of the Acton Free Press) Printing and Publishing Building on Willow Street North. The paper eventually settled at 373 Queen Street East, where New Tanner Publishing exists today. Although Nolan was still heavily involved in the paper, changes were abound. The new publisher was Ted Tyler Jr., issues were coming out on Thursdays, and it had become a free publication again. Ted Tyler‚Äôs father, Ted Sr., was Mayor of Acton from 1945-1957, and Ted Jr. was very active in the community. He owned Tyler Air, Tyler Transport Ltd. and a Radio Shack. He won Citizen of the Year in 1982, and was a longtime member of the Acton Heritage Committee, leading the old Town Hall restoration. The paper renamed itself as The New Tanner in 1998. The paper continued to publish in 2016 with Tyler as publisher and editor and Traci Gardner as assistant editor, as a weekly 12 page paper for 40 cents an issue.

Inspired by the Rolling Stones song \\"Stupid Girl\\", the song's lyrics criticizing fashion saw controversy for alleged misogyny, which Costello forcefully rejected. Released as an album track, the song has since seen positive critical reception and has been included in compilation albums and in Costello's live setlists. The song has also been featured as the theme song to the second season of The Deuce, featuring additional vocals by Natalie Bergman. Background \\"This Year's Girl\\" was written by Costello as an \\"answer song\\" to the 1966 Rolling Stones song, \\"Stupid Girl\\". He explained the relationship between the songs, \\"My lyrics might have been tough on the girl but it was full of regret and a little sympathy, while the Jagger/Richards song seemed to take delight in being heartless and cruel\\". Costello summarized the song as being \\"about an idea of glamour and attraction\\". The lyrics of \\"This Year's Girl\\" resulted in Costello being criticized for attacking women. Costello rebuked these accusations, saying. \\"Everything in the song is about the way men see women and what they desire from them. If there is a lie being told, then it is the one that a girl might be prepared to live or tell, in order to live up to some false ideal of attraction. That may contain disappointment and be critical, but it hardly constitutes hatred\\". Costello also compared it positively against \\"Stupid Girl\\", saying, \\"The Stones wrote 'Stupid Girl' and they're heroes. I wrote 'This Year's Girl', saying that fashion is a trap, a much more compassionate song, and everyone said I was a misogynist\\". During the intro of \\"This Year's Girl\\", Costello plays a Gretsch Country Club guitar that he had bought in San Francisco during the making of the album. The song features a stop-start drum beat from Pete Thomas which has been compared by critics to the drum track on the Beatles' 1965 song \\"Ticket to Ride\\". Costello added maracas and \\"Mersey vocal harmonies\\" to the track to mimic the 50s rock and roll influence of the song. Release and reception \\"This Year's Girl\\" was released as the second track on Costello's 1978 sophomore album, This Year's Model. It was not released as a single. The song has since appeared on Costello compilations, such as Girls Girls Girls. An alternate version of the song has been released on later editions of This Year's Model. \\"This Year's Girl\\" has generally received positive attention from music critics. Matt LeMay of Pitchfork Media praised Pete Thomas' drumming on the song, explaining, \\"He keeps the beat deep and powerful, putting accents in all the right places without ever attempting to take the spotlight off the freak up front\\". Jim Beviglia of American Songwriter ranked the song as the 14th best Elvis Costello song ever, calling the track \\"a song that has no expiration date on its excellence\\". The Daily Telegraph's Martin Chilton named the song Costello's 34th best. In 2018 a version of \\"This Year's Girl\\" featuring supporting vocals by Natalie Bergman was used as the theme song for season 2 of the HBO drama series The Deuce. The show's music supervisor, Blake Leyh, was a punk-rock fan and wanted a female-sung track that would be historically accurate to the show. He explained the process, \\"Elvis and his producer Sebastian Krys got hold of the original multitrack master tapes so that we could take the song apart and reconstruct it as a male/female duet. We tried quite a few different approaches to the duet, using different singers and different edits of the song. Sebastian had worked with Natalie before and suggested her as someone who could hold her own against Elvis' original vocal, and when we combined their voices the idea worked.\\" Live history Since its release in 1978, \\"This Year's Girl\\" has been a mainstay of Costello's live setlist. A live version of the track appears on Live at Hollywood High, where, during the intro to the song, Costello engages the crowd, asking \\"Are they any girls here tonight?\\" and, when the crowd's response was too meek, jokes, \\"Well I think me and the fellas better go home then, if there are no girls here...\\" During his 2018 tour, Costello performed the song as the opening track at his concerts.

The network consists of mutual, overlapping ties between members of the dyad as well as non-mutual ties. While an explicit conceptualization of duocentric social networks appeared for the first time in an academic publication in 2008, the history of the analysis dates back to at least the 1950s and has spanned the fields of psychology, sociology, and health.  History  = Original conception = Coromina et al. coined the term duocentered networks to describe the analytical technique of combining two individuals‚Äô (or egos) social networks to examine both the shared network members (or alters) between a dyad and those that are connected to only one individual. In this original conceptualization, Coromina et al. did not consider the relationships between the alters (i.e., the ties between alters) to be a necessary component of duocentric network analysis. The impetus for this original conceptualization was a compromise between the two most commonly used social network analytical methods: egocentric and sociocentric network analyses. In an egocentric network analysis, a singular individual, his or her network members, and (occasionally), the ties between those alters are the focal point of the analysis. Egocentric analyses have been used in a wide range of fields, including physical health, psychopathology, family studies, and intimate relationships. On the other hand, the sociocentric network approach utilizes a bounded group as the unit of analyses, examining all ties between actors in the group. This has been utilized to study health in retirement communities and entire cities (e.g., the Framingham Heart Study), as well as in the workplace and classroom settings. Sociocentric networks could be used to answer research questions focused on dyads, but the time, cost, and difficulty of collecting network data from all members in a bounded group is often prohibitive. Coromina et al. also state that duocentered networks relieve issues of data collection in sociocentric networks. First, it reduces ‚Äúrespondent inaccuracy‚Äù in reporting network contacts, which will be more prevalent in less well socially connected individuals. Because the dyad is selected for a specific network research question, they are more likely to be central members of their networks and better positioned to accurately report on their network contacts. Second, the technique reduces ‚Äúunit non-response,\\" which is the failure of an eligible study participant to respond or provide enough information to deem the response statistically usable. Because the focus of a duocentered network is only two individuals rather than a larger group, it will ostensibly be easier to gather usable information. = Kennedy et al. (2015) expansion = Kennedy et al. maintained this basic framework, but redefined the concept as duocentric networks, and suggested that information on the relatedness of ties in the network should be collected. Coromina et al. did not take this approach because of the respondent inaccuracy and unit non-response bias that similarly affect sociocentric analyses. Respondent inaccuracy in the context of duocentric networks means that people will inaccurately report the connections between their network members. Unit non-response follows from this difficulty; if people are unable to report connections, certain analyses that rely on these connections may not be possible.  Analysis  = Structural Measures = There are several common structural metrics derived from duocentric social networks: * Degree centrality: The number of ties that an ego has with other network members. More central egos have a greater number of connections. * Closeness centrality: An ego has higher closeness centrality as the number of ‚Äústeps‚Äù it takes to get to other alters in the network decreases. If an alter is the friend of a friend of one's partner, this will decrease one's closeness centrality as compared to a friend of one's partner (i.e., one step closer to the ego). * Betweenness centrality: If a network is visualized as many separate paths connecting network members to each other through varying number of links, an ego has higher betweenness centrality to the extent that they lie on more paths between alters in a network. Higher betweenness centrality indicates that one plays a larger role as an intermediary between network members who may not be directly connected. * Density: The total number of ties in a network relative to the total number of possible ties in a network. * Overlap: Unique to duocentric networks, overlap measures the number of shared ties between two egos. * Diversity: Similar to density, diversity measures the size of the non-overlapping network members of both egos in the dyad. * Components: A component is a portion of the social network that is disconnected from the rest of the full network. The members in a component are connected either directly or through a maximum of one mutual tie. Generally, a greater number of components signals a less well-connected network. * Isolates: A measure of fragmentation in the network, isolates in a duocentric network are those that are connected to only one ego and to no other network members. = Compositional Measures = Compositional measures are the characteristics of the individuals who make up the network or other societal norms and structures that may influence the structure and function of a social network. Compositional measures include social support, intimate relationship approval from network members, proportion of family or friends in the network, demographic characteristics, and norms. = Feedback Loops = Although primarily supported in egocentric network analyses, evidence suggest that dyads can influence the composition and structure of the duocentric networks in which they are embedded. For example, Bryant, Conger & Meehan (2001) found that a wife's marital satisfaction predicted lower discord between husbands and the wife's parents at a later time.  Applications  = Application to intimate relationships = One of the first studies examining duocentric social networks was Elizabeth Bott's 1957 finding that the density of spouse's separate networks is positively associated with marital role segregation, a finding now known as the Bott Hypothesis. While Bott did not examine the overlapping network of spouses, her work was among the first to collect network data separately from both members of a dyad, and use that data to predict a dyadic phenomenon. Perhaps the most well-studied phenomenon utilizing a duocentric network approach in the context of intimate relationships is network overlap. Most of this research points to higher relationship satisfaction as the level of overlap increases. Network overlap increases as couples transition to cohabitation, and remarriages tend to have less overlap than first marriages. Additionally, one finding suggests that more equal numbers of each partner's family contained in the overlapping network is associated with higher marital satisfaction for heterosexual couples. Other structural measures have received relatively less attention in the study of intimate relationships. Research shows a positive association between duocentric network size and marital satisfaction. Additionally, marriages in which both spouses are in their first marriage have larger networks than marriages in which both spouse is remarried. Other studies have highlighted non-results, including that social network density is not associated with relationship satisfaction and that density is not associated with marital role segregation (a refutation of the Bott Hypothesis). The link between compositional duocentric network factors and intimate relationships is less well-studied. However, evidence from duocentric analyses suggest that discord with in-laws predicts lower satisfaction, commitment, and stability in marriages over time. Additionally, support and approval from the social network tends to be associated with higher commitment and marital satisfaction. = Application to other fields = Duocentric social network analyses have been used less often outside the context of intimate relationships. One of the earliest examples examined the frequency with which two people mutually named one another in their respective network reports. The study recruited one person who listed their network members, then those network members were contacted and asked to list their own network members. About 86% of the time, people named by the original interviewee also named that interviewee on their own list. Another study of parents of children with brain tumors found that overlap of non-kin was near 50%, while overlap for kin was slightly higher. More peripheral overlapping ties (i.e., those to whom the couple is less close) was associated with lower rates of mental health disorders. Another study examined duocentric networks in sibling pairs aged 7‚Äì13. Monozygotic twins had the most overlap in their peer networks (82%), followed by same-sex dizygotic twins (67%), same-sex virtual twins (e.g., unrelated peers matched on certain characteristics; 62%), friend-friend pairs (48%), opposite-sex dizygotic twins (42%), same-sex full siblings (39%), opposite sex virtual twins (37%), and opposite-sex full siblings (27%). Genetics, sex (same- or opposite-sex), age, and relationship intimacy affected rates of peer overlap. Another example used pairs of corporations engaged in a business alliance as the focal unit, and found that the more common partners (i.e., overlap) between the two firms, the less likely their alliance would dissolve.  Variants of duocentric network analyses  Kennedy et al. (2015) outline the most rigorous duocentric network study as one in which both members of the dyad report the specific individuals contained in their social networks. However, the time and cost of this form of data collection has led researchers to use less stringent techniques to gather information on a dyadic network. = Global Network Perceptions = Rather than asking respondents to list the specific people contained in their social network, researchers occasionally ask for global perceptions of network qualities from both members of a dyad. This methodology limits many structural analyses because the relationships between network members is unknown, unless the structural qualities are addressed at a global level (e.g., for global perceptions of overlap, see Kearns & Leonard (2004)). Therefore, these studies typically highlight how compositional network aspects affect the dyad. For example, in the study of intimate relationship research, this methodology has been used to show how global perceptions of approval from the network vary across relationship stage, closeness to family predicts changes in marital happiness, the degree to which liking one's partner's family predicts relationship dissolution, the effect of network support on relationship satisfaction, and the relationship between time spent with the network and relationship commitment. = Single Ego Reporting = Another variant of the duocentric network approach is to interview only one member of a focal dyad, but require the individual to report on both their own and the other person's social network, or the other individual's relationship to their own network. In many of these studies, respondents report global network perceptions. For example, one study asked respondents to report on the propensity for a respondent's relationship partner to receive support from their own network (a global measure of support). Support was positively associated with relationship satisfaction. Another study asked respondents to report their perception of approval from their relationship partner's family (another global measure), which was found to be negatively associated with relationship dissolution. However, some research utilizes specific alter reporting in a single ego methodology. Milardo (1982) asked respondents to report their romantic partner's relationship to each of their own, specific, network members. This method allowed the researcher to understand how much of the ego's social network overlapped with his or her partner without collecting information from the partner. However, this approach risks the ego inaccurately reporting the relationship between their partner and the individual network members. Another study asked homeless youth to list recent sexual partners, other non-sexual partner network members, and the relationships between these alters. The risk of unprotected sex was higher to the degree that sexual partners knew other members of the youth's social network.

History  The regiment was raised on 16 September 1859 after the Kingdom of Sardinia had annexed Lombardy after the successful conclusion of the Second Italian War of Independence. The regiment was instantly employed in the Italian campaigns in central and Southern Italy, earning a Bronze Medal of Military Valour for its conduct at Senigallia where it charged a column of papal troops. During World War I the regiment served on the Italian front, earning its second Bronze Medal of Military Valour for its conduct during the Battle of Monastier on 19 June 1918. After World War I the regiment was disbanded on 20 April 1920 and its squadrons transferred to the Regiment \\"Cavalleggeri di Aosta\\" (6th). It was raised again on 14 March 1938 in preparation for World War II. During the war the regiment served in annexed Albania and participated in the Axis Invasion of Yugoslavia in spring 1941. For its conduct in the Yugoslav campaign the regiment was awarded a War Cross of Military Valour. Afterwards the regiment remained on the anti-partisan duty in occupied Yugoslavia until it dissolved around 8 September 1943 after Italy had changed sides with the Armistice of Cassibile. On 1 September 1964 the battalion-sized Squadrons Group \\"Lancieri di Milano\\" was raised in Monza in Lombardy, which served as reconnaissance unit of the Infantry Division \\"Legnano\\". During the 1975 army reform the squadrons group received the war flag of the \\"Lancieri di Milano\\" regiment and moved to Orzano di Remanzacco in Friuli Venezia Giulia, where it joined the Mechanized Division \\"Mantova\\" as the division's reconnaissance unit. For its conduct and work after the 1976 Friuli earthquake the squadrons group was awarded a Bronze Medal of Army Valour, which was affixed to the battalion's war flag and added to the battalion's coat of arms. When the Mantova was disbanded in 1986 the squadrons group became the reconnaissance unit of the Armored Brigade \\"Pozzuolo del Friuli\\". At this stage the Lancieri di Milano was equipped with a mix of Leopard 1A2 main battle tanks and VCC-1 armored personnel carriers. With the end of the Cold War the army began to draw down its forces and one of the first units to disband was the Lancieri di Milano on 10 December 1989.

The show, featuring professional nanny Jo Frost, is an adaptation of the British series of the same name (also featuring Jo Frost). Frost devotes each episode to helping a family where the parents are struggling with their child-rearing. Through instruction and observation, she shows the parents alternative ways to discipline their children and regain order in their households. Frost is a proponent of the \\"naughty chair\\" theory of discipline and is strictly opposed to smacking. It aired on ABC from January 17, 2005 to March 18, 2011. A spin-off of the show was produced and was titled America's Supernanny. On March 27, 2019, it was announced that Supernanny would return for a 20-episode season that premiered on January 1, 2020 on Lifetime with Frost as host again. The season also began airing in the UK on July 20, 2020 on E4. Format The show begins with a short introductory clip of highlights from the episode; after the title segment, Frost is featured riding in a London TXII with the vanity plate \\"SPRNANNY\\", where she shows a DVD player with the family's submission video. The submission video introduces the parent(s), children, with their ages, and in some cases other important family members, single parents, as well as the parents' occupations (including if one parent stays at home with the children) and the specific issues the family is facing including clips, concluded by a final call for help alongside a reassuring statement from Frost telling the family she's \\"on her way!\\" Frost spends the first day in observation mode, taking mental notes to assess the situation and to devise a plan of action. If a situation is especially serious, she will point out the matter for immediate action. After the first day, she holds the parents' meeting (with clips showing the parents initial reaction), where she praises the family for their beautiful children and then mentions the problems noted. (Earlier episodes had the meeting at the end of the first day; later episodes have it the following day.) Frost then returns with tools designed to assist the parents in child- rearing. For example, if she determines that the children are misbehaving due to a lack of scheduled activity time with the parents, she will bring in a set schedule, customized for the family's needs. She frequently devises \\"house rules\\" for the family. Sometimes the rules are predetermined by Frost, and other times she provides a blank paper and has the family devise them. Frequent issues on the show involve discipline (as Frost does not endorse spanking as a means, she introduces the family to the \\"naughty chair/step\\" timeout) and sleep separation. After a time, Frost leave the houses to allow the family to implement her actions on their own. The parents' actions are still being filmed, and upon her return Frost calls another parents' meeting to praise them for doing well and/or show them where they went wrong. She then provides reinforcement as needed. The ending shows the family saying goodbye to Frost. Later episodes feature the family at a later time showing how well her techniques have worked, along with (after the credits, often featuring a blooper segment) a teaser segment for the next week's episode. Frost has called in outside assistance on more than one occasion: *One family was dealing with an autistic son; Frost called in a clinical professor with expertise in autism to assist the family in communicating with their son. *Another family (from the Chicago area) had a son showing signs of disrespect and future juvenile delinquency; Frost called in Chicago native and NBA superstar Dwyane Wade to speak with him. *A third family had the father exhibiting classic signs of abuse (especially toward the female members of the family); Frost called in a social worker with expertise in abusive behavior, as well as a woman who was abused by her father and, as a result, made poor decisions in relationships. *In another case, the father was an alcoholic, and Frost located a nearby Alcoholics Anonymous support group for him to attend. *One family had deaf parents who were being taken advantage of by the younger children, who were not deaf; Frost called in an interpreter to help with communication. *One family was dealing with a son who has type 1 diabetes, so Frost compiled a chart of celebrities living with diabetes and called upon a professional snowboarder who is diabetic and runs snowboard camps for children who are diabetic. *One family was dealing with a daughter who had Down syndrome; Frost called in the professor from the segment with the autistic boy to help the girl and enlist the family in speech therapy. *During the latest series Jo took the mother to review her medication with a doctor to support her anxiety.

History  And thus began the first issue of the Acton Free Press, an English language newspaper that began publishing on July 2, 1875. The paper was printed weekly, initially on Fridays, then Thursday mornings, and finally moving to Wednesdays in the 1970s. A side of the newssheet could be ready on a Saturday, while the final side would not be until the night before delivery. The paper‚Äôs location moved throughout the town from the Acton Post Office in 1875, Matthews Hall, above Hotchken's Bakery, the Adams family property at the corner of Mill and John, finally settling in modern plants during 1927 and 1959. A subscription cost of $1/year was set by Hacking, surging up to $4.00 in the 1960s, $7 for outside of Canada. The paper followed the format of many community newspapers, with Neighbourhood News for surrounding areas, Sunday school psalms, local poetry, ads for the leather industry, vital records and tax reminders. The founding publisher and editor was Joseph Henry Hacking. Joseph Hacking was born March 2, 1837, one of 12 children to William, a painter, and Margaret, of Leeds, England and Limerick, Ireland, respectively. The earliest mention of his involvement in printing comes out of Detroit, circa 1864, where he is listed as a printer in the Commercial Advertiser office. In 1866 Hacking publishes the Listowel Banner, selling it off in 1873, and the Guelph Advertiser after it amalgamated with the Mercury, circa 1873. It was while here that he decided Acton was a prime spot for another paper. As to why this was, we can assume his father's purchase of an acre of land in 1855, where the post office (and future site of the paper) sits, may be related. Having been incorporated as a village in 1865, the 800 strong community of Acton would now have a 4 page paper of its own. Hacking wished to be clear regarding his paper's stance on politics from the outset, with this prospectus from the first issue. This philosophy would be openly continued by subsequent publishers with Mr. Hacking's departure and hand off of the paper to the Moore brothers and Mr. Galbraith in 1877. During this time, his Excelsior Printing House won awards for ornamental and letterpress work at the 1874 and 1875 Guelph Central Exhibition. Afterward, Joseph went on to establish the Clifford Arrow, then returning to Guelph before heading west to Manitoba for a number of years. After the passing of his first wife while in Winnipeg, he relocated to Buffalo, married again and passed away on April 18, 1895 at the age of 58. With a glowing obituary in the April 25, 1895 issue of the Free Press, Hacking was laid to rest in a family plot near Listowel, Fairview Cemetery in North Perth. The Moore brothers would begin the dynastic century of family publishing of the Acton Free Press with Thomas Albert. Apprenticed to Hacking during the first years of the paper, T. Albert would leave soon after to become Moderator for the United Church of Canada, leaving his brother Henry Philip to take up the reins. An Actonian from birth, H. P. was born on October 18th, 1857 or 1858, marrying Harriet Speight (whose sister Lottie was married to Thomas Albert) at the age of 22. He would steward the newspaper through until his death in 1929, in the grand home called Moorecroft (corner of Frederick and Church Street) featuring a monumental stained-glass window of his hero, Charlemagne. Henry was well-known for his homemade birdhouses he gave to children, and having struck up a friendship with Sir Harry Brittain, founder of the Commonwealth Press Union, which led to an exchanging of town coat of arms with England's Acton. He was a Police Magistrate for counties of Halton, Peel and Wellington, so dedicated to his position that the paper printed this during its 100th Anniversary issue. Although both Joseph and Henry had strong stances on keeping the Free Press from leaning towards any political party, they took part in petitioning the government in support of matters important to printers, Hacking for reduced duties of imported printing materials, and Moore for amending a statute regarding libel law. Henry collaborated on Acton's Early Years, a book recounting the town's history through his column The Old Man of the Big Clock Tower with the next publisher of the Free Press, George Arlof Dills. Dills was born in 1893 in Port Dover, and like Moore's brother Albert, Dills apprenticed with Henry in 1909. He presided over the expansion of the Free Press' staff from 4 employees to 34 at the time of his death. In 1917 he installed the county's first Linotype machine to reduce the laborious setting of type by hand. The town's first Citizen of the Year in 1958, Dills was part of the Acton Council for 25 years. George would begin expanding his publishing empire with the Canadian Champion in 1948. His accomplishments were recognized with the first Ontario Weekly Newspaper Association's Man Of The Year award in 1954. His passing in his 73rd year, January 13, 1966, and his son David taking over with his wife Mary \\"Kay\\" Dills (1928‚Äì2015) as editor, marked all but three of the first 100 years of Acton Free Press being in the hands of Moores and the Dills. Sons David and Jim Dills continued the Dills newspapers, David leaving the navy and Jim finishing a Journalism degree at Ryerson. The Georgetown Independent was established by them in 1973, and in 1978 decided to sell off the papers to Inland Publishing. Into the 1980s the paper was published by Don McDonald, with Gord Murray was editor, who replaced Hartley Coles, Coles then editing full-time for the Independent after taking over for Mary Dills when she retired in 1978. Hartley had been apprenticed as a printer's devil to the G. A. Dills in 1944. The paper historically served the communities of Eden Mills, Rockwood, Nassagaweya, Acton, Georgetown, Milton, Everton, Ospringe, Campbellville, Limehouse, Ballinafad, Silvercreek, Erin Village, Glen Williams, Moffat, Churchill, Ebenezer and Silverwood. The Free Press ran until eventually merging with the Independent, now publishing as the Independent & Free Press.

She is a biology professor at Indiana University and the interim director of the university's biotechnology program. Bush conducts research focusing on bacterial resistance mechanisms to beta- lactam antibiotics.  Education  Bush received her BA, magna cum laude from Monmouth College in 1965, with a major in chemistry and a minor math-physics. In 1970 Bush graduated from Indiana University Bloomington with her Ph.D. in biochemistry under Henry R. Mahler. Bush was a postdoctoral fellow at University of California, Santa Barbara from 1970 to 1971.  Scientific Contributions  Bush is internationally known for her research on the discovery and characterization of beta-lactamases, the family of enzymes that confer resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins. Antibiotic resistance has emerged as a key threat to the global fight against infectious diseases, and Bush‚Äôs research into the mechanisms of action for beta-lactamases has provided key insights in development of beta-lactamase inhibitors to combat these modes of resistance. Her review article on beta-lactamases established commonly used nomenclature. She co-curated a website for this family of enzymes that has named over 2000 beta-lactamases. During her 36 years of antibiotic discovery efforts in the pharmaceutical industry, Bush worked on the research teams that brought 9 anti-infective leads to clinical trials and 5 antibiotics to FDA and/or EMA approval (aztreonam, piperacillin-tazobactam, levofloxacin, doripenem and ceftobiprole). As a Professor, Bush has continued to lead research characterizing beta-lactam resistance in enteric bacteria and collaborates with pharmaceutical companies in evaluating clinical potential of novel antibacterial agents by studying the spectrum of activity and mechanisms of resistance. This work has been included in data packages submitted to the FDA for drug approval, and research from her laboratory has supported the approval process for 6 new antibacterial therapies (ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, plazomicin, eravacycline, imipenem-relebactam and cefiderocol).  Professional Career  After completing her postdoctoral research, Bush became an instructor of biochemistry in the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill School of Medicine for a year before serving as an Assistant Professor of Chemistry at the University of Delaware from 1972 to 1973. She then started an 18 year stint at The Squibb Institute for Medical Research in Princeton, NJ, spending her first 5 years in the analytical chemistry department beginning her research on beta-lactamases and beta- lactamase inhibitors. While at The Squibb Institute, Bush was part of the team that discovered Aztreonam and rose from a Research Investigator position to increasing leadership and research scientist roles, ultimately named not only a Principal Investigator but also as a Research Leader and a Research Fellow. She then went on to American Cynamid/American Home Products/Wyeth-Aherst in Pearl River NJ. Continuing her research and discovery efforts in antibiotic chemotherapy where she led teams that discovered a new carbapenem and supported the registration and launch of piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn¬Æ). After a year as Director of Microbial Biochemistry at the Astra Research Center in Boston, Bush moved on to lead antibacterial discovery teams at Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development, Raritan NJ from 1997 to 2009 when she became an independent consultant to a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. In 2013, Bush returned academia to leading research projects, to teach and mentor graduate students , and is now a Professor of Practice in Biotechnology and the Interim Director of Biotechnology at Indiana University in Bloomington, IN. Awards and Honors In recognition of her outstanding research in antibiotic chemotherapy, Bush received the Hamao Umezawa Memorial Award on November 24, 2017 at the 30th annual meeting for the International Society of Chemotherapy for Infection and Cancer, held in Taipei, Taiwan. She was the first woman to receive this award.

The rotational speed controls the drop size. Spray drying and spray painting are the most important and common uses of this technology. Many industries use processes like evaporative cooling, meteorology, printing, medical applications, spray combustion, coating, and drying, which need to convert a large mass of liquid into a dispersion of smaller droplets of a size range of microns. Various spray devices for the above-mentioned conversion have been developed over time, such as atomizers, sprayers, nozzles, and applicators. The spray generated by these devices can be viewed as liquid droplets submerged in a continuous phase of gases. This spray can be generated in a variety of methods. Generally, it is done by producing a high speed between the phase of gases and the submerged liquid to be atomized. These devices achieve this atomization by releasing the liquid at very high speed into the unagitated air. This same principle is used in a Rotary Atomizer. The rotating cup or disc forces the liquid to come out at a very high speed through its rim. The liquid can also be atomized by using a reverse process, instead of accelerating the liquid, gas can be accelerated to achieve a relatively higher speed than the liquid. The devices using this method to achieve atomization are called as airblast, air-assist, or popularly twin-fluid atomizers. The Rotary, Pressure-swirl or Twin-fluid Atomizers are used in general. Still, for special applications, alternative atomizer types are there such as the 'electrostatic' atomizer in which electrical pressure is used to drive the atomization, and the 'ultrasonic' atomizing device in which the liquid is passed through a transducer vibrating at ultrasonic frequencies to generate shorter wavelengths which convert the fluid into smaller droplets. Since the flow rate of liquid is low in both of these devices, their applications are limited.  Working Principle  Concept of Rotary Atomization Rotary atomizers work on the principle of centrifugal energy; this energy is used to produce a high relative speed between the fluid and air which is essential for atomization. A rotary atomizer comprises a rotating surface. This surface can be in the form of a flat or a vaned disc, a cup, or a slotted wheel. A basic rotary atomizer is displayed in the figure. The liquid first flows radially outwards in the disc and is then released from the disc's outer limits at a relatively very high speed. The atomization relies on the liquid's flow rate and the disc's rotational speed. The fluid is released from the disc's outer limits as uniform-sized droplets at low flow rates. At a comparatively high flow rate, ligaments are generated along the disc's outer limits which later on break into smaller droplets. When the flow rate is further increased, the ligaments become unable to fit in with the liquid flow, and hence a fine sheet of liquid is produced which expands past the disc's rim. This sheet, later on, disintegrates into ligaments and finally, drops are formed. The transition from ligament to sheet formation can be delayed by ragging the disc's edges. Rotary atomizers belong to the mechanical atomizers; hence, neither a high- pressure liquid nor a pressurized gas is required for atomization. The energy required for atomization is transferred directly from the atomizer body to the liquid. This gives us an advantage that the energy required for atomizing the liquid is directly supplied mechanically and energetically. The complicated and costly production of compressed gas, for example, compressed air, is no longer necessary. It is sufficient to feed the liquid to be atomized to the atomizer under low pressure. Sometimes a low hydrostatic pressure is adequate. = Working Formulae = Generally, small gas turbines operate under high rotational speed of more than 100,000 rpm. Even small-sized atomizer of 10 cm diameter revolving at 30,000 rpm can impart an acceleration of 490, 000 m/s2 (which is fifty thousand times of gravity) on the liquid fuel. Eventually, such fuel atomizers create very tiny droplets. Size of droplet formed by atomizer depends on various properties of the fluid (both liquid and gaseous fluid) such as density, viscosity and surface tension between fluids. The rotary atomizer in which liquid is revolving along with it at the rate of œâ and has radial channels at nominal radius R=(R1+R2)/2 in the edge from which high-speed liquid interacts with gas to form droplets. Considering the nominal radius of the channel and thus of mass of liquid inside channel equal to R, the liquid inside channel will experience the centrifugal acceleration of Rœâ2, which causes the liquid to form a thin layer of thickness t on both walls of the channel. At very high acceleration thickness of the liquid layer (film) is very small in order ¬µm. The shape of the channel also decides the effectiveness of atomization and the size of droplets. That is one aspect of determining the size of the droplet is the velocity of liquid in the channel (v=Rœâ). So, we have four dimensionless terms derived from the above properties which determine the performance of atomization. 1\\\\. Liquid-gas density ratio r = [œÅL / œÅG] where œÅL and œÅG are densities of liquid and gas respectively 2\\\\. Viscosity ratio m = [¬µL / ¬µG] where, ¬µL and ¬µG are viscosities of liquid and gas respectively 3\\\\. Weber Number Wet = [œÅG Vc2 t/œÉs] where œÉs is surface tension between liquid and gas contact surface. It is the ratio of the force applied by the gas on the liquid layer to the surface tension force acting on liquid. 4\\\\. Ohnesorge Number Oht= [¬µL / (œÅL œÉs t) 1/2] It is the ratio of viscous force inside the layer to the surface tension force acting on liquid. Altogether, all these terms describe three main phenomena of atomization viz., inertia, viscous diffusion and surface tension. For practical fuel atomizer, Ohnesorge number is limited to Oht<<1 and the size of the droplet are not much affected by Ohnesorge number. So, viscous effects can be neglected. But Weber number can't be neglected since surface tension and inertia are the major phenomena of the atomization process. For small values of We, surface tension is dominant, and this force pulls the liquid towards the wall of the channel, making a single column that eventually breaks after meeting air resulting in comparatively larger droplets. This is known as the subcritical breakup of liquid. Whereas, for the supercritical breakup of liquid (more significant values of We), force applied by gas is dominant for breaking of liquid which results in fine small size of droplets.  Features of a Rotary Atomizer  * Because of the breakup energy which the wheel's high-speed supplies in liquid feed systems, they can run at relatively low pressure. The atomizer drive gives the high speed to the wheel. * Clogging can be a problem for spray nozzle systems, whereas rotary atomizers can work in such situations. * A rotary atomizer can manage large amounts of abrasive and non-abrasive feeds. * A rotary atomizer can take very viscous liquids. * A rotary atomizer is flexible according to particle size. It can be modified from 5¬µ to 150¬µ by changing the wheel speed. * A rotary atomizer can give different powder characteristics and bulk density by equipping with different wheel designs. * A rotary atomizer can be fitted with a wide variety of wheels with various designs and sizes for abrasive and non-abrasive feeds.

The period encompasses early domestic reforms, growing international tensions, and ending with the failure of the 1970 sugar harvest. In 1959 in the immediate aftermath of the revolution, Fidel Castro would visit the United States to ask for aid and boast of land reform plans, which he believed the U.S. government would appreciate. Throughout 1960 tensions slowly escalated between Cuba and the United States due to the nationalizations of various American companies, retaliatory economic sanctions, and counterrevolutionary bombing raids. In January 1961 the U.S. cut off diplomatic relations with Cuba, and the Soviet Union started to solidify relations with Cuba. The U.S. feared growing Soviet influence in Cuba and backed the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion of April 1961. By December 1961 Fidel Castro for the first time openly expressed his communist sympathies. Castro's fears of another invasion and his new Soviet allies influenced his decision to put nuclear missiles in Cuba, triggering the Cuban Missile Crisis. In the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, the United States promised not to invade Cuba in the future; in compliance with this agreement, the U.S. withdrew all support from the Alzados, effectively crippling the resource-starved resistance. The counterrevolutionary conflict, known abroad as the Escambray Rebellion, lasted until about 1965, and has since been branded the War Against the Bandits by the Cuban government. During the first decade after the Cuban Revolution, various reforms in Cuban society tackled racial integration, women's equality, communications, healthcare, housing, and education. By the end of the 1960s, all Cuban children received some education, compared with fewer than half before 1959.Mastering Modern World History by Norman Lowe, second edition. Anti-discrimination legislation as well as general social reforms helped to improve the living standards of Afro-Cubans. After the issue of racial integration was considered resolved, the Cuban government passed legislation that counter-attacked past anti- discrimination legislation. This new law made it illegal to even mention discrimination or the topic of racial equality. Between 1959 and 1980, an estimated 500,000 Cubans left the island for the United States, for both political and economic reasons; 125,000 left in 1980 alone, when the Cuban government briefly permitted any Cubans who wished to leave to do so. By 2010, the Cuban American community numbered over 1.9 million, 67% of whom lived in the state of Florida. Background The Cuban Revolution () was a guerrilla campaign by Fidel Castro's revolutionary 26th of July Movement and others against the dictatorship of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista. The revolution started in July 1953, and continued to varying degrees until the rebels finally ousted Batista on 31 December 1958, creating a new revolutionary government.\\"Cuba Marks 50 Years Since 'Triumphant Revolution'\\" . Jason Beaubien. NPR. 1 January 2009. Retrieved 9 July 2013. After learning of Batista's flight the rebels immediately started negotiations to take over Santiago de Cuba. On 2 January, Cuban Colonel Rubido, ordered his soldiers to stand down, and the rebels took the city. The rebel forces under Guevara and Cienfuegos entered Havana at about the same time. The rebels met no opposition on their way from Santa Clara to Havana. Castro arrived in Havana on 8 January after a victory march. His first choice of president, Manuel Urrutia Lle√≥, took office on 3 January. History =1959: Rebel victory= Fidel Castro during a visit to Washington, D.C., shortly after the Cuban Revolution in 1959 On 11 January 1959 Ed Sullivan would interview Fidel Castro in Matanzas and broadcast it on The Ed Sullivan Show. In the interview Ed Sullivan refers to the Castro and other rebels as \\"a wonderful group of revolutionary youngsters\\" and point out their admiration for Catholicism. Fidel Castro would deny the rebels affiliation with communism. Hours after the interview Fidel Castro would ride on captured tanks into the capital in Havana. Hundreds of Batista- era agents, policemen and soldiers were put on public trial, accused of human rights abuses, war crimes, murder, and torture. About 200 of the accused people were convicted of political crimes by revolutionary tribunals and then executed by firing squad; others received long sentences of imprisonment. A notable example of revolutionary justice occurred after the capture of Santiago, where Ra√∫l Castro directed the execution of more than seventy Batista POWs. For his part in taking Havana, Che Guevara was appointed supreme prosecutor in La Caba√±a Fortress. This was part of a large-scale attempt by Fidel Castro to cleanse the security forces of Batista loyalists and potential non-Communist opponents (including high-ranking rebels such as Pedro Luis D√≠az Lanz and Huber Matos) of the new revolutionary government. Though many were killed or imprisoned, others were dismissed from the army and police without prosecution, and some high-ranking officials of the Batista administration were exiled as military attach√©s. It is widely believed that those executed were guilty of the crimes of which they were accused, but that the trials did not follow due process. Starting in March 1959 Fidel Castro announced in a speech he would attempt to end racial discrimination in Cuban society. He detailed a plan to bring black and white Cubans together in shared schools and other institutions, via equal opportunity. In a later televised discussion Castro claimed his plans were mostly to improve economic conditions for black Cubans and that he is not encouraging total social integration. Social clubs were to be totally integrated, private beaches opened, and schools totally nationalized. Private schools that once had majority white student bodies were now nationalized and faced an influx of new black and mulatto students. Social clubs were told to integrate as early as January 1959. White and black social clubs began to dissolve. Racism became branded as counterrevolutionary and critics of the government were often branded as racists. Some white Cubans were fearful of integration, while some black Cubans were fearful of the closing of black social clubs and its affects on Afro-Cuban cultural life. On 15 April 1959, Castro began an 11-day visit to the United States, at the invitation of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. Fidel Castro made the visit in hopes of securing U.S. aid for Cuba. While there he openly spoke of plans to nationalize Cuban lands and at the United Nations he declared Cuba was neutral in the Cold War. He said during his visit: \\"I know the world thinks of us, we are Communists, and of course I have said very clear that we are not Communists; very clear.\\" According to geographer and Cuban Comandante Antonio N√∫√±ez Jim√©nez, 75% of Cuba's best arable land was owned by foreign individuals or foreign (mostly American) companies at the time of the revolution. One of the first policies of the newly formed Cuban government was eliminating illiteracy and implementing land reforms. Land reform efforts helped to raise living standards by subdividing larger holdings into cooperatives. Comandante Sori Marin, who was nominally in charge of land reform, objected and fled, but was eventually executed when he returned to Cuba with arms and explosives, intending to overthrow the Castro government. In March 1959, Castro had already ordered rents for those who paid less than $100 a month to be halved. Productivity in the country would later decreased, and the country's financial reserves were drained within only two years.. After appointing himself president of the National Institute of Agrarian Reform (Instituto Nacional de Reforma Agraria ‚Äì INRA), on 17 May 1959, Castro made law the First Agrarian Reform, limiting landholdings to per owner. Cuba would also forbid further foreign land-ownership. Large land-holdings were broken up and redistributed; an estimated 200,000 peasants received title deeds. To Castro, this was an important step that broke the control of the well-off landowning class over Cuba's agriculture. Though popular among the working class, it alienated many middle-class supporters.; ; , . Although Castro refused to initially categorize his government as 'socialist' and repeatedly denied specifically being a 'communist', Castro appointed advocates of Marxism-Leninism to senior government and military positions. Most notably, Che Guevara became Governor of the Central Bank and then Minister of Industries. Appalled, Air Force commander Pedro Luis D√≠az Lanz defected to the U.S.; ; . Former Batista associates had fled the island in the immediate aftermath of the revolution, but as property slowly became nationalized professionals in various nationalized businesses would begin to emigrate from Cuba to the United States. =1960: Developments in Cuba= Journalists and editors began to criticize Castro's left-ward turn, the pro-Castro printers' trade union began to harass and disrupt press actions. In January 1960, the government proclaimed that each newspaper need to publish a \\"clarification\\" by the printers' union at the end of every article that criticized the government. These \\"clarifications\\" signaled the start of press censorship in Castro's Cuba.Bourne 1986. p. 197.Coltman 2003. pp. 165‚Äì66. Fidel Castro (far left) and Che Guevara (centre) lead a memorial march in Havana on 5 March 1960 for the victims of La Coubre freight ship explosion Cuba-United States relations were heavily strained after the explosion of a French vessel, the La Coubre, in Havana harbor in March 1960. The ship carried weapons purchased from Belgium, and the cause of the explosion was never determined, but Castro publicly insinuated that the U.S. government was guilty of sabotage. He ended this speech with \\"¬°Patria o Muerte!\\" (\\"Fatherland or Death\\"), a proclamation that he made much use of in ensuing years. The United States was already suspicious of Fidel Castro after he enacted the Agrarian Reform Law banning foreigners from owning land and his appointment of communist Nu√±ez Jimenez as head of the reform program. U.S. President Eisenhower refused any aggressive action against Cuba knowing it would push Cuba towards an alliance with the Soviet Union in the Cold War. Fidel Castro made a trip to New York City starting September 18 to attend the United Nations general assembly. While there international tensions were much higher than during his 1959 trip and he was restricted to only staying on Manhattan island. Castro checked in to the Shelbourne Hotel then checking out a few hours later, complaining that the Shelbourne had asked for a $10,000 cash advance. Castro would then threaten the United Nations that he would camp in Central Park if he couldn't find lodging, eventually checking into the Hotel Theresa in Harlem. While there Castro would meet with various interviewers with African-American newspapers, and other notable people such as Malcolm X, Langston Hughes, Nikita Khrushchev and Allen Ginsberg. During his stay various Castro supporters and opponents would crowd the outside of the hotel, often fighting. Various sensationalist stories came out about Castro at the time, rumors claimed his entourage were harboring prostitutes in the hotel and that Castro was originally kicked out of the Shelbourne for keeping live chickens in the room. By September 26 Castro would finally speak at the U.N. and would speak for over four hours in denouncing United States foreign policy. Two days later Castro would return to Cuba in a soviet jet, after his jets were repossessed at the airport. Shortly after taking power, Castro also founded a revolutionary militia to expand his power base among the former rebels and the supportive population. Castro also founded the informant Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDRs) in late September 1960. Local CDRs were tasked with keeping \\"vigilance against counter-revolutionary activity\\", keeping a detailed record of each neighborhood's inhabitants' spending habits, level of contact with foreigners, work and education history, and any \\"suspicious\\" behavior. Among the increasingly persecuted groups were homosexual men. On 13 October 1960, the US government then prohibited the majority of exports to Cuba ‚Äì the exceptions being medicines and certain foodstuffs ‚Äì marking the start of an economic embargo. In retaliation, the Cuban National Institute for Agrarian Reform took control of 383 private-run businesses on 14 October, and on 25 October a further 166 US companies operating in Cuba had their premises seized and nationalized, including Coca-Cola and Sears Roebuck.Bourne 1986. p. 214.Coltman 2003. p. 177. On 16 December, the US then ended its import quota of Cuban sugar.Bourne 1986. p. 215. By the end of 1960, the revolutionary government had nationalized more than $25 billion worth of private property owned by Cubans.Lazo, Mario (1970).

New York: Longman. =1961: Continuing tensions= In January 1961, Castro ordered Havana's U.S. Embassy to reduce its 300 staff, suspecting many to be spies. The U.S. responded by ending diplomatic relations, and increasing CIA funding for exiled dissidents; these militants began attacking ships trading with Cuba, and bombed factories, shops, and sugar mills.; ; . Both Eisenhower and his successor John F. Kennedy supported a CIA plan to aid a dissident militia, the Democratic Revolutionary Front, to invade Cuba and overthrow Castro; the plan resulted in the Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961. On 15 April, CIA-supplied B-26's bombed three Cuban military airfields; the U.S. announced that the perpetrators were defecting Cuban air force pilots, but Castro exposed these claims as false flag misinformation.; ; . Fearing invasion, he ordered the arrest of between 20,000 and 100,000 suspected counter-revolutionaries,; . publicly proclaiming that \\"What the imperialists cannot forgive us, is that we have made a Socialist revolution under their noses\\". This was his first announcement that the government was socialist.; ; . John F. Kennedy meeting members of Brigade 2506 before the Bay of Pigs Invasion. The CIA and Democratic Revolutionary Front had based a 1,400-strong army, Brigade 2506, in Nicaragua. At night, Brigade 2506 landed along Cuba's Bay of Pigs, and engaged in a firefight with a local revolutionary militia. Castro ordered Captain Jos√© Ram√≥n Fern√°ndez to launch the counter-offensive, before taking personal control himself. After bombing the invader's ships and bringing in reinforcements, Castro forced the Brigade's surrender on 20 April.; ; . He ordered the 1189 captured rebels to be interrogated by a panel of journalists on live television, personally taking over questioning on 25 April. 14 were put on trial for crimes allegedly committed before the revolution, while the others were returned to the U.S. in exchange for medicine and food valued at U.S. $25 million.; ; . Castro's victory was a powerful symbol across Latin America, but it also increased internal opposition primarily among the middle-class Cubans who had been detained in the run-up to the invasion. Although most were freed within a few days, many left Cuba for the United States and established themselves in Florida.. In 1961, the Cuban government nationalized all property held by religious organizations, including the dominant Roman Catholic Church. Hundreds of members of the church, including a bishop, were permanently expelled from the nation, as the new Cuban government declared itself officially atheist. Education also saw significant changes ‚Äì private schools were banned and the progressively socialist state assumed greater responsibility for children. The Cuban government also began to expropriate from mafia leaders and taking millions in cash. Before Meyer Lansky fled Cuba, he was said to be worth an estimated $20M ($163,685,121 in 2016, accounting for inflation). When he died in 1983, his family was shocked to find out that his estate was worth about $57,000. Before he died, Lansky said that Cuba \\"ruined\\" him. In July 1961, the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations (IRO) was formed by the merger of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement, the People's Socialist Party led by Blas Roca, and the Revolutionary Directorate of 13 March led by Faure Chom√≥n. On 26 March 1962, the IRO became the United Party of the Cuban Socialist Revolution (PURSC) which, in turn, became the modern Communist Party of Cuba on 3 October 1965, with Castro as First Secretary. Castro remained the ruler of Cuba, first as Prime Minister and, from 1976, as President, until his retirement on February 20, 2008. His brother Ra√∫l officially replaced him as president later that same month. In April the country began a massive eight-month long effort to abolish illiteracy in Cuba.Perez, Louis A. Cuba Between Reform and Revolution. New York: Oxford UP, 1995. Print. It began in April 1961 and ended on December 22, 1961, successfully raising Cuba's literacy rate to nearly one-hundred percent.Uriarte, Miren.

History  Lancieri die Firenze lancers at Ponte di Versa 1866 The regiment was raised on 12 September 1753 as Corps of Tuscan Dragoons () by Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor, who had inherited the Grand Duchy of Tuscany in 1737. The regiment was disbanded after France occupied Tuscany in 1799 and restored after the French occupation ended in 1814. When the Kingdom of Sardinia annexed United Provinces of Central Italy and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies after the Second Italian War of Independence the Tuscan Dragoon Regiment became the only regiment from all annexed states to be integrated in the Italian Army. The regiment served in the Third Italian War of Independence during which it earned a Bronze Medal of Military Valour in the Battle of Ponte di Versa on 26 July 1866. During World War I the regiment served on the Italian front, earning its second Bronze Medal of Military Valour for its conduct during the decisive Battle of Vittorio Veneto in 1918. During World War II the regiment was part of the 2nd Fast Division \\"Emanuele Filiberto Testa di Ferro\\" and served in annexed Albania, occupied Greece, and occupied Yugoslavia, where it dissolved around 8 September 1943 after Italy had changed sides with the Armistice of Cassibile. On 21 June 1951 the company-sized \\"Lancieri di Firenze\\" Armored Cavalry Squadron was raised in Rome. Equipped with M8 Greyhounds it served as the reconnaissance unit of the Armored Division \\"Pozzuolo del Friuli\\". In 1956 the Lancieri di Firenze were expanded to squadrons group, but already on 31 December 1958 division and squadrons group were disbanded. During the 1975 army reform the II Squadrons Group of the Regiment \\"Piemonte Cavalleria\\" (2nd) in Sgonico was reorganized and renamed as 9th Tank Squadrons Group \\"Lancieri di Firenze\\" on 1 October 1975. Equipped with Leopard 1A2 main battle tanks the squadrons group received the war flag of the Regiment \\"Lancieri di Firenze\\" (9th) and joined the Armored Brigade \\"Vittorio Veneto\\". For its conduct and work after the 1976 Friuli earthquake the squadrons group was awarded a Bronze Medal of Army Valour, which was affixed to the battalion's war flag and added to the battalion's coat of arms. After the end of the Cold War the Italian Army began to draw down its forces and the Vittorio Veneto was one of the first brigades to disband. On 31 July 1991 the brigade was deactivated along with most of its subordinate units and the Lancieri di Firenze moved to Grosseto in Tuscany to join the Mechanized Brigade \\"Friuli\\". In 1992 the squadrons group was elevated to regiment without changing size or composition. On 7 October 1995 the Regiment \\"Lancieri di Firenze\\" (9th) was renamed Regiment \\"Savoia Cavalleria\\" (3rd) and the Lancieri di Firenze's war flag was transferred to the Shrine of the Flags in the Vittoriano in Rome.

This building played an important role in the lives of many Chinese descendants (Tionghoa) in Surabaya. History The Devil's House was built in 1809, instituted by the Dutch East India Company. This building was a governor office for Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC). A Chinese doctor and businessman bought the building in 1945 with the intention of opening a Chinese funeral home. In 1948, The Indonesian National Armed Forces battled the Communist Party of Indonesia, which threatened Chinese families at that time. They decided to transform this building into a refugee shelter for the Chinese in Madi. After G30SPKI, as Soharto led the New Order, Chinese-Indonesians were suspected of allying with the Chinese Communist Party. Another generation of immigrants found shelter at the Devil's House. The majority of Chinese Surabayans were supporters of Soekarno, complicating the situation, as some were captured as targets. The name of the building, Gedung Setan (Devil's House), was generated by the people due to the poor situation that made the Chinese become isolated from education and the Chinese language itself. They were smuggled in the darkness, veiled from the regimes they sought a haven from. In the twenty-first century the majority of residents are of Chinese descent.

Design  Cab and leading bogie Driving wheels and the Buchli drives The class was an updated development of the pre-war 2D2 5500 built for the PO-Midi. Mechanically similar, they incorporated a number of improvements to the electrical system to give smoother control. The 9100 represented the ultimate of the rigid-framed electric locomotive; later designs would be bogie designs. The design had originated on the Paris-Orl√©ans with the two class locomotives of 1925. These had four traction motors, one per axle, driving through Buchli drives and following Swiss practice. They were considered to be more reliable in service than other PO electric locos, such as the 2BB2 400. The original Swiss drive used a single Buchli gear on one side to drive each axle, the French locomotives used a double-sided drive with the Buchli gear duplicated for each end of the axle, which was considered to reduce wear. The locomotives operated from a catenary with two pantographs, powering four traction motors. Like most other 1,500 V DC locomotives, they used four motors, with speed control by series-parallel switching and fine control by field-weakening resistances. Improvements to the design of the motors, particularly the compensating windings, allowed finer steps of resistance to be used, so that the jerk when switching steps was only a fifth of what it had been previously. This also improved their high-speed performance, giving a top speed of . Like other French locomotives of this era, they were not equipped with a driver's seat at first, merely a simple saddle.

It is the first transgender crisis hotline to exist in the United States as well as Canada. It is also the only suicide hotline whose operators are all transgender (binary or non-binary). As of 2019, the organization was host to approximately 95 volunteers in addition to a small paid staff. Background The Trans Lifeline was founded in 2014 to address the epidemic of suicidality and lack of national resources for the trans community. It was founded by Nina Chaubal and Greta Gustava Martela, two San Francisco software engineers. In 2017, the organization merged with Trans Assistance Project in order to address a component of the trans narrative that is often missing, that of socioeconomic justice. The merger became the organization's microgrants program, which gifts small grants to trans people who are in need of funds to cover the fees associated with legal name changes. The organization's guiding ethos is \\"justice-oriented collective community aid,\\" a concept the organization promotes based on the belief that both economic justice and having affirming trans community are part of and key to trans liberation. As of 2019, the microgrants program had dispersed a total of $375,000. Approximately 1,000 people were served, with each grant being approximately $360.https://www.papermag.com/trans-lifeline-crisis- hotline-2639196886.html As of June 1, 2020, 75% of microgrants made each cycle go to transgender people of color. At least 20 microgrants each month go to youth ages 18-29. The organization‚Äôs hotline does not engage in non-consensual active rescue , meaning operators never call 911, police, or emergency services on callers without an expressed request and consent. See research associating involuntary hospitalization with increases suicide attempts after discharge . Additionally, they believe that calling the police on transgender people in crisis, particularly trans people of color, causes more harm. The organization also oversees a program the Inside Advocacy project to support incarcerated trans people. The project provides funds for trans people's commissaries so that they may afford \\"basic comforts\\" while imprisoned. The program also works to provide microgrants to trans people in ICE detention. As of June 2020, the organization had set in motion a Spanish language extension, https://www.translifeline.org/blog/post/alvaro-gamio-cuervo-talks-spanish- language-services-and-the-future-of-the-hotline in order to serve Spanish- speakers calling the hotline. This involved recruiting multilingual volunteer staff to answer calls. The new service serving the Spanish speaking community went into effect on July 1, 2020. Budget In a June 2019 interview on the podcast Queery, Trans Lifeline Executive Director Elena Rose Vera stated that 85% of the organization's budget comes from members of the general public in the form of small donations. Personnel Up until 2018, Sam Ames served as the organization's Executive Director. Since then, Reverend Elena Rose Vera has held the post.

Written and directed by series creator Sam Esmail, it aired on November 17, 2019, on USA Network. In the episode, Elliot Alderson (Rami Malek) and his therapist Krista Gordon (Gloria Reuben) are held hostage by Fernando Vera (Elliot Villar), who attempts to coerce Elliot into working alongside him by understanding Mr. Robot. The episode received critical acclaim, with many naming it as one of the best of the entire series. Particular praise was directed at Malek and Villar's performances, as well as Esmail's direction and writing. For the episode, Esmail received a nomination for Best Episodic Drama at the 72nd Writers Guild of America Awards.  Plot  Following the events of the previous episode, Elliot is kidnapped by Vera and his associates Peanut and Javi. He is removed from the boot of a car and then tied to a chair in a room adjacent to Krista, who is also being held hostage. Vera recounts his life after the events of \\"eps1.5_br4ve- trave1er.asf\\", having returned to the Dominican Republic. He describes his journey from street hustling to taking control of the country as well as Haiti in 87 days. On day 88 however, his inscrutable feelings of emptiness are vindicated by a shaman who tells him he must return home. Realizing his desire to return to New York to reconcile with Elliot, he states his plan to take over New York with Elliot as his business partner. Elliot, remembering Shayla's death at Vera's hands, refuses to cooperate without Krista's safety guaranteed. Elliot is brought to Krista and shown that she is safe. Vera reveals his knowledge of Mr. Robot, having extracted it from Krista, and declares his desire to meet him. Mr. Robot takes control after Krista is threatened. He points out flaws in Vera's plan, but offers to help if Krista is let go. Vera protests the suggestion, stating that Krista's captivity guarantees Elliot's cooperation. Elliot offers Vera the money from the Cyprus Bank hack he is planning. Vera and his crew view the hack's details on a laptop. Seeing they are distracted, Elliot grabs for a gun in his bag. He threatens to shoot Vera and pulls the trigger, but realizes that the gun had already been unloaded. Angered, Vera threatens to shoot Krista, until Elliot admits that he needs her. Vera, comparing her to the shaman that had helped him, decides to change his approach. Vera forces Krista and Elliot into an impromptu therapy session to discover more about Mr. Robot. Krista protests, saying it will not work without a controlled and private environment. Vera orders his associates to leave. Krista, still not satisfied, acquiesces after convincing from Elliot. Growing impatient with the discussion of Elliot's mother, Vera demands they discuss the origins of Mr. Robot's existence. Elliot begins to feel that a secret is being kept from him. Frustrated by Mr. Robot and Krista's attempts at diverting the subject matter, he encourages Vera to read from Krista's files. The window event from his childhood is brought up as a moment of significance. Elliot's version of events, that he swung a bat at his father and then jumped out of a window in a state of mania, is called into question after Krista points out Elliot's reliance on Darlene's memories and not his own. Krista compares his poor memory of the day to his inability to remember moments where Mr. Robot takes control. Elliot realizes Mr. Robot took control that day, having existed for longer than he had thought. Krista questions Mr. Robot's purpose, and puts together the pieces that Elliot needed protecting, specifically from his father. He finally remembers that he was sexually abused by his father as a child as he breaks down. Unable to come to terms with his abuse, Elliot is consoled by Vera. Elliot blames Vera for the revelation. Vera then reveals his own past with sexual abuse, from friends of his mother. Vera says people with their trauma should not struggle alone, and confides his philosophy that people like them become unstoppable. After Vera assures Elliot that he isn't alone anymore, Krista, sneaking up, stabs Vera in the back.  Production  The episode is presented in a five-act structure which critics compared to resembling the structure of a play, emphasized by its reliance on dramatic audio cues and usage of two adjacent sets. It was also broadcast on USA Network commercial-free, and featured crisis resource information for viewers.  Reception  The episode received universal acclaim from critics and audiences. The episode has a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 9.3/10. Special attention was given to Malek's performance, Esmail's direction, and cinematography. The New York Times praised the show's courage and \\"high risk, high reward\\" storytelling of asking the audience to wrestle with something horrific right at the root of the show. The A.V. Club declared the episode among the series' finest episodes and a potent statement of purpose from Esmail. TVLine named Malek their \\"Performer of the Week\\" for his performance in the episode, stating \\"It's the heaviest moment we've seen so far on the series, a true game-changer, and Malek played every difficult note of it with astounding precision\\" and that \\"Malek has added another layer to a truly unforgettable performance.\\" Sam Esmail received a nomination for Best Episodic Drama at the 72nd Writers Guild of America Awards for the episode.

In 1929, Edgecombe had treated 249 patients. Through fundraising, the hospital installed an x-ray machine. Gerri Major was part of its Woman's Auxiliary.

She spent most of her career with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, including the Second World War when she served for six years' as a troop ship. In 1964 John S Latsis bought Stratheden, renamed her Henrietta Latsi and put her into service as a cruise ship. In 1966 he renamed her Marianna Latsi. She was laid up from 1967 and scrapped in 1969. Stratheden was the fourth to be built of a set of five sister ships that came to be called the \\"Strath\\" class. All previous P&O; steamships had black-painted hulls and funnels but the \\"Strath\\" class were painted with white hulls and buff funnels, which earnt them the nickname \\"The Beautiful White Sisters\\" or just \\"The White Sisters\\". Building The Vickers-Armstrongs at Barrow-in-Furness built all five \\"Strath\\" class liners. The Duchess of Buccleuch and Queensberry launched Stratheden on 10 June 1937 and the ship was completed in December 1937. The \\"Strath\\" class varied very slightly in size. Stratheden had exactly the same dimensions as the fourth ship in the class, Strathallan: long, beam and draught. Strathedens tonnages were , and . Like and Strathallan, Stratheden had mechanical reduction drive from her turbines to her screws and was built with only one funnel. This is unlike the earlier and , which had turbo- electric transmission and were each built with three funnels. The \\"Strath\\" class ships thus form two sub-classes, with Stratheden being in the later sub- class. After building Strathmore, Vickers-Armstrongs made further changes to the Strath-series design. Stratheden was given a funnel taller to keep her decks cleaner, and her promenade deck had fewer supports than Strathmores to give a more open, less crowded appearance. There were also slight changes to the arrangement of the public saloons, and her tourist class saloons were bigger than Strathmores. Strathallan was built to the same design as Stratheden. Stratheden had four water-tube boilers and two auxiliary boilers with a combined heating surface of . They supplied steam at 450 lbf/in2 to six steam turbines which drove her twin screws by single reduction gearing. Between them the turbines developed 4,912 NHP and gave her a service speed of . On sea trials on 10 December 1937 Stratheden achieved a top speed of . On 16 December Vickers delivered her to P&O.; Civilian service Passengers aboard Stratheden and people on the quay at Hamilton, Queensland bidding each other farewell Strathedens pre-war service alternated seasonally between scheduled liner services and holiday cruises. Her scheduled liner route was between Tilbury in England and Brisbane in Queensland via the Straits of Gibraltar, Suez Canal, Bombay, Colombo, Fremantle, Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney. She left Tilbury on her maiden voyage to Brisbane on Christmas Eve, 24 December 1937. On 1 September 1939, the day that Germany invaded Poland, Stratheden sailed from Tilbury for Australia via India and Ceylon as scheduled. It was the last time she saw her home port of Tilbury for more than six years. She went as far as Sydney, where she arrived on 11 October. She began her return voyage on 17 October and passed through the Suez Canal on 14 November, but because of the war she docked in Plymouth on 24 November and did not continue to Tilbury. On 12 December 1939 Stratheden left Britain for Australia, this time sailing from Southampton instead of Tilbury. She went via Gibraltar and the Suez Canal, celebrated Christmas in the Indian Ocean, called at Bombay, and arrived at Colombo on New Year's Day 1940. On this voyage she went via Singapore, and reached Sydney on 19 January. On her return voyage her ports of call included Malta on 27 February and Marseille two days later, and she reached Southampton in 6 March. Troop ship On 19 March 1940 the Ministry of Shipping requisitioned Stratheden to be a troop ship. On 30 March she left Southampton for Australia, sailed via the Mediterranean and Suez Canal as usual, and reached Brisbane on 13 May. She began her return voyage from Brisbane the same day, and called at Colombo on 8‚Äì9 June. But on 10 June, the day after Stratheden left Colombo, Italy declared war on the Allies, which made the Mediterranean unsafe for Allied merchant shipping. And France capitulated on 22 June, ceding her entire Channel and Atlantic coasts to Germany, which brought shipping to and from Southampton within easier range of enemy attack. Stratheden diverted to Cape Town, where she joined Orient Line's and Pacific Steam's to form Convoy BC C which sailed on 24 June 1940 for Freetown in Sierra Leone. There they joined three other UK merchant ships to form Convoy BC A, which the Royal Navy escorted to Liverpool, arriving on 16 July. was the largest troop ship in Convoy WS 2, in which Stratheden sailed from Liverpool to the Indian Ocean in 1940 On 5 August 1940 Stratheden left Liverpool carrying 699 passengers and 317 troops. She sailed with Convoy WS 2 via Freetown and Cape Town as far as Bombay. WS 2 included the \\"Strath\\" liner and ten other troop ships, the largest of which was Canadian Pacific's liners . Stratheden reached Bombay on 15 September 1940 and left a week later carrying 268 passengers and 418 troops with Convoy BM 1. Some of her passengers disembarked at Colombo, whence Stratheden continued with Convoy BM1 to Singapore. From there she sailed unescorted via Fremantle, Adelaide and Melbourne and reached Sydney on 17 October. Stratheden did not see Australia again until after the war was over, in October 1945. =Troops to Egypt= Stratheden spent most of the next two years moving troops between Britain, India, Ceylon and Egypt: sometimes in convoys but other times unescorted. In 1941 her movements varied to include calls in Trinidad in the Lesser Antilles and Halifax in Nova Scotia. In spring 1941 Stratheden carried 3,264 troops in Convoy WS 7, which included 10 troop ships carrying a total of at least 24,615 troops. WS 7 left the Clyde on 24 March, reached Freetown on 4 April and then split into sections to continue to Cape Town and Suez. WS 7 included all five of P&O;'s \\"Strath\\" liners, and may be the only time all five sisters sailed together. WS 7 also included P&O;'s , the French liner , Royal Mail Lines' , Canadian Pacific's , , and , Cunard-White Star Line's , Orient Line's , , and , Union-Castle Line's and and the Dutch Johan van Oldenbarnevelt. In 1941 led Convoy WS 7, in which Stratheden sailed from Scotland to Sierra Leone WS 7's escorts were led by the battleship , supported by the battleship and two light cruisers. There were 19 destroyers: 16 Royal Navy plus the Royal Canadian Navy destroyer HMCS St Clair, Free French destroyer and Free Polish destroyer . =Trinidad and Canada= On 15 May 1941 Stratheden left Suez for a long, indirect, unescorted voyage home to Britain. She called at Port Sudan, Mombasa, Durban and Cape Town, then crossed the Atlantic twice: westward to Trinidad, where she called on 5‚Äì6 June, and then eastward to the Clyde, where she arrived on 18 June. Stratheden next made two crossings to Canada. On 8 August 1941 she left the Clyde carrying 3,391 troops in Convoy CT 1 to Halifax, and on 26 August she left Halifax with Convoy TC 12B carrying 3,269 troops to the Clyde. On 17 September she left the Clyde carrying 3,169 troops with Convoy WS 1 to Halifax. On 27 September 1941 Stratheden left Halifax for Egypt. She sailed unescorted via Trinidad and Cape Town to Durban. There she joined Convoy CM 18X, which left on 29 October and took her as far as Aden. By the time she left Durban, Stratheden was carrying 3,190 troops. From Aden she continued unescorted to Suez, where she arrived on 16 November. On 16 November 1941 Stratheden left Suez unescorted for Canada. She called at Port Sudan, Durban and Cape Town, celebrated Christmas 1941 in mid-Atlantic, reached Trinidad on New Year's Eve and Halifax in 5 January 1942. On 9 January 1942 Stratheden left Halifax carrying 2,866 troops in Convoy NA 1 to the Clyde. =Troops to India and Egypt= On 16 February 1942 Stratheden left the Clyde carrying 4,134 troops in Convoy WS 16. She called at Freetown and Durban, where WS 16 divided and she continued with WS 16B to Bombay, where she arrived on 8 April. On 18 April Stratheden left Bombay unescorted for her return voyage. She called at Cape Town and Freetown and reached the Clyde on 23 May. In 1942 led Convoy WS 20, in which Stratheden sailed from the Irish Sea to Sierra Leone On 21 June 1942 Stratheden left the Clyde carrying 4,496 troops and joined Convoy WS 20, which included 15 troop ships and carried least 44,305 troops. WS 20's largest troop ship was Stirling Castle, one of three Union-Castle liners in the convoy. Strathmore was also in WS 20, carrying 4,710 troops. WS 20's escorts were led by the battleship , supported by 15 Royal Navy destroyers and the Canadian destroyer HMCS Georgetown. Convoy WS 20 divided. Stratheden continued to the Indian Ocean in Convoy WS 20A, which dispersed off Aden. Stratheden reached Suez on 11 August 1942. Stratheden returned home unescorted. She left Suez on 14 August 1942, called at Durban, Port Elizabeth, Cape Town and Freetown and reached Liverpool on 26 September. =Operation Torch= In Liverpool Stratheden was fitted with additional anti- aircraft guns. In October 1942 she took part in a troop landing exercise off the Isle of Mull. Her next mission was Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of Vichy French North Africa. On 1 November 1942 carrying 3,646 troops she left the Clyde for Algiers in Convoy KMF 2, whose 13 troop ships included Strathmore, Empress of Canada, Duchess of Richmond and three US Moore- McCormack liners , and Uruguay. KMF 2 also included cargo ships laden with stores and petrol. The convoy was escorted by four Royal Navy destroyers, three sloops, two US Coast Guard cutters on loan to the Royal Navy, and the armed yacht HMS Philante. Stratheden returned from Algiers in Convoy MKF 2. The Polish troop ship sailed with Stratheden in four convoys in 1940 and two in 1942 A few weeks later Stratheden took another 4,714 troops to Algiers in Convoy KMF 4, which left the Clyde on 27 November. The convoy's troop ships included Monarch of Bermuda, , Duchess of Bedford, Otranto, three Union-Castle liners, three Dutch troop ships and the Polish Batory and . The light cruiser led KMF 4's escorts, which included 12 Royal Navy destroyers, the Royal Australian Navy destroyer and two frigates. Stratheden returned from Algiers in Convoy MKF 4, which reached the Clyde on 18 December. =Two voyages to India= On 23 January 1943 Stratheden left the Clyde for India with the P&O; troop ships and Maloja. Between them they carried 13,244 troops, of whom 4,643 were aboard Stratheden. They sailed as far as Freetown in Convoy WS 26, which consisted mostly of troop ships, including , Empress of Canada, Duchess of Richmond, Mooltan, Arundel Castle, two Dutch troop ships and one Belgian. WS 26's escorts included the armed merchant cruisers Canton and Cilicia, five Royal Navy destroyers, two Australian destroyers, two Greek Navy destroyers and a frigate. Convoy WS 26 divided and Stratheden continued to India in Convoy WS 26B, which reached Bombay on 17 March 1943. Stratheden began her return voyage a week later. She sailed unescorted from Bombay to Cape Town, where she joined the troop ship to form Convoy CF 12 to Freetown. By the time the two ships left Cape Town on 19 April, Stratheden was carrying 1,642 troops and 1,496 prisoners of war. From Freetown the pair continued as Convoy CF 12A, reaching Liverpool on 10 May 1943. On 19 June 1943 Stratheden left the Clyde carrying 4,397 troops to India. Off Liverpool the next day she joined Convoy WS 31, whose largest troop ship was Stirling Castle. WS 31's escorts were led by the light cruiser and flotilla leader and included 14 destroyers. From Freetown Stratheden continued unescorted via Cape Town to Bombay, where she arrived on 13 August. In 1943 led Convoy CM 45, in which Stratheden sailed from Bombay to Aden On 19 August 1943 Stratheden sailed unescorted from Bombay to Durban, where she embarked 4,653 troops and on 14 September sailed for Egypt. She sailed as far as Aden with Convoy CM 45, whose largest troop ship was Stirling Castle. CM 45 was heavily escorted by the battleship , heavy cruiser , light cruiser , three Royal Navy destroyers and three Australian destroyers. From Aden Stratheden continued unescorted through the Suez Canal and reached Port Said on 16 October. =Between Britain and Egypt= On 17 October 1943 Stratheden left Port Said for the Clyde in Convoy MKF 25, whose larger troop ships included Britannic, Stirling Castle, the \\"Strath\\" liner Strathaird and the Italian . Next Stratheden joined Convoy KMF 27, which took at least 22,372 troops from Britain to Egypt. 4,600 of them sailed aboard Stratheden. KMF's larger troop ships included Strathaird, Maloja, Orontes, Otranto and . KMF 27 passed Gibraltar around Christmas Day 1943 and reached Port Said on 30 December. On 20 January 1944 Stratheden left Port Said for Britain carrying 4,137 troops as part of Convoy MKF 28. The convoy called at Augusta, Sicily, where the number of troops aboard Stratheden was increased to 4,524. As the convoy sailed west, more troop ships joined it from Algiers including Orion and the \\"Strath\\" liner Strathmore. By the time MKF 28 passed Gibraltar ithe convoy was carrying almost 24,000 troops. It reached Liverpool on 7 February. =To India and back= Royal Rotterdam Lloyd's Sibajak sailed with her in seven convoys between 1942 and 1944 On 21 February 1944 Stratheden left Liverpool carrying 4,330 troops. She joined Convoy KMF 29, which had left the Clyde and took her as far as Alexandria via the Mediterranean. KMF 29 included at least 19 troop ships, the largest of which was . Between them they carried at least 32,652 troops. KMF 29's escorts included two light cruisers, the Canadian anti-aircraft cruiser , nine Royal Navy destroyers, two Greek and two US destroyers and six Royal Navy frigates. From Alexandria Stratheden continued along the Egyptian coast to Port Said, then through the Suez Canal to Aden, where on 14 March she joined Convoy AB 34A to Bombay. She reached Bombay on 20 March 1944. On 26 March 1944 Stratheden left Bombay carrying 2,384 troops. She sailed with Convoy BA 66A as far as Aden, continued unescorted through the Red Sea and Suez Canal. In Port Said she joined Convoy MKF 30, whose largest troop ship was Capetown Castle and which also included the \\"Strath\\" liner Strathnaver. By the time MKF 30 left Port Said on 8 April, Stratheden was carrying 3,528 troops and Strathnaver was carrying 5,752. MKF 30's escorts were led by the light cruiser and included HMCS Prince Robert, at least five Royal Navy destroyers, two Greek destroyers and four frigates. MKF 30 reached Liverpool on 21 April and Stratheden berthed the next day. =Voyages with Strathmore= in port. Stratheden and Strathmore sailed together continuously in convoys from May to October 1944. From May to October 1944 Stratheden and her sister Strathmore sailed in the same convoys. On 5 May 1944 Stratheden left Liverpool carrying 3,132 troops and joined Convoy KMF 31, which had started from the Clyde and included at least 21 troop ships. The largest was Capetown Castle, and also among them Strathmore carrying 3,309 troops. In total KMF 31 carried at least 21,025 troops. KMF 31's escorts included HMCS Prince Robert and on 11 May were joined by the escort carrier . KMF 31 took Stratheden as far as Port Said, from where she, Strathmore and several other troop ships continued unescorted through the Suez Canal and Red Sea. At Aden Stratheden with 4,036 troops and Strathmore with 4,679 joined Convoy AB 40A, which reached Bombay on 1 June. On 7 June 1944 Stratheden carrying 3,226 troops and Strathmore carrying 2,850 left Bombay in Convoy BA 71. From Aden they continued unescorted to Port Said. There they joined Convoy MKF 32, which took Stratheden carrying 2,420 troops and Strathmore carrying 4,180 to Liverpool, where they arrived on 4 July. Union-Castle liners took part in many Freetown, Indian Ocean and Mediterranean convoys. sailed with Stratheden in six convoys between 1942 and 1944. On 24 August 1944 Stratheden carrying 4,418 troops and Strathmore carrying 3,526 left the Clyde in Convoy KMF 34, which took them as far as Port Said. They continued unescorted to Aden. On 15 September Stratheden carrying 4,325 troops and Strathmore carrying 3,994 left Aden in Convoy ABF 4, reaching Bombay on 20 September. In Bombay they were joined by Strathnaver. On 27 September 1944 Stratheden carrying 2,017 troops, Strathmore carrying 3,382 and Strathnaver carrying 1,467 left Bombay in Convoy BAF 5, which took them as far as Aden. From there they continued unescorted to Port Said. On 10 October Stratheden carrying 2,585 troops, Strathmore carrying 3,629 and Strathnaver carrying 1,902 left Port Said in Convoy MKF 35. In the western Mediterranean more troop ships joined from Naples including Capetown Castle and Monarch of Bermuda, and other troop ships joined from Algiers. By the time MKF 35 passed Gibraltar it included at least 14 troop ships carrying at least 17,425 troops and 5,876 passengers. On 21 October MKF 35 reached Liverpool. There Stratheden parted company with her sisters and spent the rest of 1944 in home waters. =Twice more to India= Canadian Pacific \\"Empress\\" and \\"Duchess\\" ships sailed in numerous Freetown and Mediterranean convoys. Duchess of Richmond sailed with Stratheden in nine convoys between 1942 and 1945. On 18 February 1945 Stratheden left Liverpool carrying 4,252 troops in Convoy KMF 40, whose largest troop ships were Britannic and Stirling Castle. KMF 40 took her as far as Gibraltar, from there she continued unescorted through the Mediterranean, Suez Canal and Indian Ocean, reaching Bombay on 12 March. After a fortnight in port Stratheden left Bombay on 27 March, sailing unescorted back through the Suez Canal to Gibraltar, where she joined MKF 42. By now Stratheden was carrying 1,898 troops. MKF 42 included Duchess of Bedford and Duchess of Richmond and reached Liverpool on 17 April. On 4 May 1945 Germany unconditionally surrendered, ending the war in Europe. The next day Stratheden left the Clyde for India carrying 3,031 troops. She sailed as far as Gibraltar in Convoy KMF 44, which was her final convoy of the war. Stratheden sailed unescorted through the Mediterranean, Suez Canal and Indian Ocean, reaching Bombay on 30 May. She left Bombay on 5 June and returned via the Mediterranean, calling at Algiers on 20‚Äì21 June and reaching Liverpool on 25 June. =Canada, Norway and Australia= On 23 July Stratheden left Liverpool for Qu√©bec carrying some of the first Canadian troops to return home. On 10 August Stratheden got back to Liverpool and on 15 August Japan surrendered, ending the Second World War. Stratheden had sailed and carried 150,000 armed service personnel without serious incident. From 31 August to 6 September Stratheden sailed from Liverpool to Oslo and back. On 17 September she left Liverpool on her first voyage to Australia for five years. She called briefly at Malta, reached Fremantle on 12 October and Sydney on 19 October. She began her return voyage from Sydney on 26 October and called at Fremantle and Bombay. On 3 December 1945 she arrived in Southampton for the first time since 1940. Stratheden continued in Government service until 27 July 1946, when the Ministry of Transport released her to her owners. Post-war P&O; service Orient Line's was refitted to return to civilian service just before Stratheden, and returned to the route between England and Australia in February 1947 In the Second World War P&O; had lost eight large passenger ships including Strathallan and Viceroy of India. Stratheden was the first of the four surviving \\"Strath\\" sisters to return to civilian service. The Ministry of Transport released Strathaird in September 1946 but kept Strathmore and Strathnaver in Government service until 1948. P&O; controlled Orient Line, which shared many of the same troop ship duties and suffered similarly heavy losses. The MoT released in April 1946, just before Stratheden. Orient and P&O; had Vickers-Amrstrongs refit Orion and Stratheden at Barrow to return to liner service, but now with more tourist class berths and fewer first class. The number of first class single cabins and special suites was reduced, crew quarters were enlarged and there were now two-berth cabins for most crew. Post-war shortages of essential materials delayed her refit, and Vickers-Armstrongs it was not until 29 May 1947 that Vickers- Armstrongs returned her to P&O.; , released by the Ministry of Transport later in 1946 and refitted with only one funnel In June 1947 Stratheden began her first-post-war civilian voyage to Sydney. In order to mitigate its post-war shortage of ships P&O; eliminated some intermediate ports of call from its timetables. This enabled ships sailing between Britain and Australia to make four return voyages a year instead of three. In 1950 Cunard chartered Stratheden for four return voyages between Southampton and New York. Cunard had planned to charter P&O;'s new for the but purpose, but Vickers-Armstrongs was late completing Chusan so P&O; provided Stratheden as a substitute. =Iason incident= On 13 March 1955 in the Mediterranean Stratheden went to the aid of the Greek trawler Iason, which was foundering in a gale with heavy sea and swell east of Cape Spartivento. At 1612 hrs Stratheden launched her number 16 boat from her port side. The boat motored close to Iason but was unable to get alongside. The trawler's crew jumped into the sea and the boat crew rescued them. Returning to Stratheden the boat was swamped by a large wave about 200 yards off the liner's port quarter and capsized. In response Stratheden launched her number 6 boat from her port side, but its motor failed to start so the ship had to recover the boat and its crew. Stratheden then came round to windward of the men in the water to launch number 1 boat and number 5 boat from her starboard side. Number 5 boat rescued from the water four survivors from Iason and three survivors from the crew of number 16 boat. Number 1 boat did not succeed in rescuing any survivors. 11 crew from Iason and eight crew from Strathedens number 16 boat were not found. The liner stayed in the area until the next morning to resume the search at first light. At 0900 hrs on 14 March the search was called off and Stratheden resumed her voyage. =Final years= In April 1956 Clementine Churchill sailed home from Colombo on Stratheden. In December that year Stratheden suffered engine trouble in Melbourne. She returned to Britain under her own power but without her passengers. In 1961 Stratheden was re-fitted as a one-class ship with berths for 1,200 tourist class passengers. In December 1963 a holiday company chartered her for four cruises. The Dutch liner Johan van Oldenbarnevelt sailed with Stratheden in convoys in 1941 and 1944. In 1963 she was refitted as the Greek cruise ship , was destroyed by fire on a cruise, and Stratheden provided medical treatment for survivors. On 23 December 1963 Stratheden provided medical facilities for survivors from the Greek-operated cruise ship , which had been abandoned after catching fire north of Madeira. Lakonia was formerly the Dutch liner and troop ship Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, which had sailed with Stratheden in convoys in 1941 and 1944. Latsis Lines On 18 February 1964 John S Latsis bought Stratheden, renamed her Henrietta Latsi and employed her as a Latsis Lines cruise ship. In 1966 he renamed her Marianna Latsi. She was laid up at Eleusis in Greece from 20 April 1967. In 1969 she was sold for scrap to Terrestre Marittima SpA. Marianna Latsi reached La Spezia on 19 May 1969, where scrapping started that September.

Built in 1926, the seventeen-story building was developed and marketed as luxury cooperative apartments for Chicago's affluent residents. Cooperative apartments, in which residents were part owners of the building and controlled its management and who could buy units, became popular with Chicago's upper class in the 1920s due in part to successful marketing by developers. The apartments at 399 West Fullerton offered an attractive location with lakeside views and modern amenities, including parking space and chauffeur service for the increasingly popular automobile. Architects McNally and Quinn designed the French Renaissance Revival building; their design includes a brick exterior with classically ornamented stone on the first three stories, decorative balustrades and window surrounds on the upper floors, and two small, steep hip roofs atop the projected sections of the facade.

Vivid color palettes and contrasting organic and geometric shapes characterize Condon's work. So too does a deliberate mixing of painting techniques, from careful rendering to loose gesture. Indeed, Condon seems to intentionally defy adherence to any single standard. Forms, places, and times move seamlessly into one another, transformed and organized by a sense rhythm divorced from reality. In her depictions of stacked spaces, history and geography are collapsed. The landscapes depicted are both themselves altered by human interaction, and the ensuing paintings feel like idiosyncratic records of Condon's mind and her imaginings of the space. As one critic puts it: ‚Äúthe result feels like a dream or memory suddenly, if fleetingly, made visible.‚Äù Viewing Condon's paintings, imbued as they are with this intense personal quality, consequently feels ‚Äúa bit like reading her diary: strangely disorienting at first, then disarming and familiar.‚Äù Themes and motifs =Pastiche= Effulgence by Elisabeth Condon The concept of pastiche is critical to understanding Condon's practice. It is evident both in the range and unlikeliness of the source material she uses, and in her final compositions, which feel like odd remixes of painting styles that combine into something wholly new. Condon draws inspiration from a wide variety of source material, from the 1970s LA glam rock scene to children's picture books to news photographs from the Iraq war. Critic Edward Gomez comments: ‚ÄúHer interests and influences are as diverse and unpredictable as her compositions are well-balanced and complete, even inevitable.‚Äù The connections among her subjects often seem tenuous, but Condon is able to draw out unexpected similarities. ‚ÄúIn lesser hands that might be a recipe for disaster\\" critic Van Siclen notes. \\"But Condon makes it work, deftly fusing the free-flowing, nonlinear perspective of Chinese painting with the free-flowing, nonlinear logic of the Seuss books.‚Äù Condon mixes both media and styles in her work. In addition to paint, she has employed Mylar sheets, metallics, glitter and rhinestones. She has command of a wide range of styles, from traditional landscape techniques to Chinese brush painting to patterning borrowed from graphic design, which makes ‚Äúfor multi-layered, exuberant work.‚Äù The graphic layers act as a ground for her organic, sensual figures. She employs every use of paint handling from delicate transparent washes to thick impasto. And she borrows elements from art movements from disparate times and places, from ancient China to the French Informel to Color Field painting. One critic even compares her work to cartoons for the ‚Äúbold colors and expressions.‚Äù Critics often comment on the difficulty of making such dissimilar elements work in a final composition: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pastiche of four styles. The colors are weird. The abstract portions won‚Äôt settle into their abstractness, and the figurative portions don‚Äôt amount to anything recognizable. It looks like it was painted by committee. And yet the painting is working.‚Äù This mix of styles and influences is distinctly postmodern and expressive of the current technological environment, where input of ideas, news, and images from around the world is fast-paced and unceasing. =Chinese scroll painting= Born in Los Angeles, Condon was drawn to Asian culture and aesthetics filtered through home decor, Disney, and fantasy television. Through her travels and studies, Condon has become deeply influenced by ancient Chinese painting and philosophy, as well as the experience of living in modern Asian cities. In 2004, on a residency in Taiwan, she began to practice Chinese painting techniques, which emphasize variety in texture and inflection, as well as improvisation. She draws from Yuan Dynasty scrolls the philosophy that a landscape painting is a portrait of an artist's inner life. She also borrows a complex sense of space and perspective, where different points of view are forged into one multi-layer and time-compressed experience. The resulting compositions have a real sense of space, but they are also puzzles, impossible to make sense of. Condon learned sumi-e brush painting, which is as much a mediation practice as it is a painting technique, where form and gesture are united in a single stroke: ‚Äúthe form is created from gesture. It‚Äôs all about the quality of line. In western art, it‚Äôs all about volume.‚Äù She often depicts ‚Äúthe four gentlemen‚Äù of Chinese painting: bamboo, orchid, chrysanthemum, and plum blossom. In discussion of her own work, she often mentions the concept of emptiness and fullness, which she learned from sumi-e painting. Whereas the western painting tradition values contrast and opposition, Condon seeks a delicate balance between fullness and emptiness in her compositions. She is also inspired by a splashed-ink method that can be found in some painting and pottery of the Later Tang Dynasty. She translates this ancient method into her modern take on paint pouring. =Paint pouring and direct experience= Condon often begins a composition with pouring acrylic or oil paint, so that the kinetic quality of the material creates unexpected forms and effects. Her use of paint has been compared to Jackson Pollock and Helen Frankenthaler (of whom Condon is a great admirer). Critic Franklin Einspruch comments on the essentialness of the paint pour to Condon's practice: ‚ÄúPours are structural necessities in her work. They provide the primal soup from which her pictures emerge. Condon‚Äôs pours are at the intersection of crossed axes, one between image and shape, the other between pattern and gesture, offering the potential in subsequent layers to transform into any of them.‚Äù She pairs uncontrolled blobs and trails of paint with her detailed renderings of buildings, trees, and flowers. Since she does not plan out compositions beforehand, forms seems emerge organically out of the accident of the pour and materiality of paint. Says Condon, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm completely spontaneous. I start with pours of paint, so that painting becomes like taking a trip, with contingencies and unexpected outcomes.‚Äù This accidental, transformational, action-based method contributes to a sense energy and directness to her work: ‚ÄúThe dynamism of Condon‚Äôs all- over compositions feels self-propelled, and it‚Äôs easy to imagine them stretching far beyond their borders into an endless, gyrating flow of birds, plants and streams of luscious, electric, energized color.‚Äù The pours make the materiality of paint central to the finished work. As one critic puts it: the paint is a ‚Äútorrent of material‚Ä¶[creating] a visual parallel to an unstoppable flood of water. This is what happens when paint is allowed to be just that, paint; it is thick, unwieldy and beautifully itself.‚Äù The energy in her paintings connects back to her fascination with Chinese art and the belief that a painting must have qi, or a vital life force. =Travel= Painting Elephant Path by Elisabeth Condon The theme of place is crucial to her work. Condon travels frequently for artist residencies, and her globetrotting is evident in her paintings. Each new place works its way into her psyche and becomes a new layer or reference. ‚ÄúThe idea of the pour as violent and sudden and the reconstruction out of that shock echoes the concept of modern travel,‚Äù Condon said. ‚ÄúYour whole ethos is impacted by where you are.‚Äù Her landscapes feature references to places as far away as Taiwan, Beijing, and Australia, as well as her native California and homes in Florida and Manhattan. She incorporates imagery from environments as diverse as the Everglades to the Grand Canyon to dense urban spaces. One painting can contain myriad spaces or timelines layered over one another: ‚ÄúPaintings hide beneath paintings in each painting. The surfaces build from stain to film to opacity. The imagery crosses from east to west coast, and east to west hemisphere, with the ease and speed of ideas.‚Äù =Femininity= Love, American Style by Elisabeth Condon In the wake of her 2014 residency in Shanghai, Condon has been embracing imagery that is considered feminine or kitsch such as flowers and birds. In Shanghai she recognized the importance of decoration to the urban landscape and classical Chinese painting. Reexamining her experience from a feminist perspective, she began drawing inspiration from suburban home decor. She reconsidered her mother's ‚Äúobsessive decorating‚Äù of her childhood home, an aesthetic that had at one time been only a symbol of her family's stifling conservatism, and transformed it into an important element of her work. She now uses vintage wallpaper patterns as a visual element in her work, and recounts asking her mother for leftover wallpaper and fabric samples to use in her studio. The plum blossom in particular is not only of central importance to Chinese art, it also appeared on the wallpaper of her childhood bedroom. With their domestic references, sumptuous colors, floral imagery, and use of pretty materials like glitter, her paintings engage with the world's disdain for a certain gender, class, and aesthetic taste. Like other Pattern and Decoration Artists, Condon reclaims her personal experience and love of beauty, asserting the importance and potential for intellectual rigor in such work. It is particularly powerful to use such imagery in large-scale, abstract work, a painting tradition that is dominated by men, expressing the feminist emphasis on personal experience, rather than a pure vision of an overarching narrative that is the project of abstract expressionism. In the current political climate and in the wake of the #metoo Movement, ‚Äúthese are also deceptively political paintings. The decorative here in Condon‚Äôs painting serves as a formal device and a marker of ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù identity asserting itself against a culture of reactionary values.‚Äù Condon says of her own use of flowers: ‚ÄúThe fleeting lifespan of flowers is mirrored by our own, as well as our environment and history. Flowers are sexual, feminine, autonomous, and dismissed as minor. As such they dwell in the margins, free from scrutiny. My flowers are fissured, on the brink of collapse; glowing with internal light, like fire, before they curdle and die.‚Äù Early work In her earliest professional work, Condon made dolls portraits- as she describes it, as a method of recreating her childhood. However, the paintings were about more than nostalgia for a time of innocence. The paintings are described as both funny and unsettling: ‚Äúambiguity and conflict are recurring themes‚Ä¶ Elisabeth Condon's deceptively decorative paintings are hardly distinguishable from the children she depicts, blurring the distinction between reality and fantasy.‚Äù Public work Urban Idyll at Astoria‚ÄìDitmars Boulevard station Condon's first major public commission was at the Tampa Airport in 2017. In 2018 Condon installed a permanent public work at the Astoria‚ÄìDitmars Boulevard station, commissioned by MTA Arts & Design. The piece, entitled Urban Idyll, consists of thirty-six laminated glass panels that are translations of elements from her paintings. The theme is the Tree of Life, and it features birds, leaves, and flowers. Reflecting Astoria's cinematic history, the long, linear compositions recall sheet music or film frames. Bio Elisabeth Condon was born in Los Angeles. She completed her BFA in Painting at Otis Art Institute of Parsons School of Design in 1986, as well as studying at UCSD for 1 year and UCLA for 2 years. She completed her MFA in Painting at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1990 before moving to Brooklyn in 1992. She has taught extensively in Florida, and travelled widely for research and residencies. She curates exhibitions about topics that are relevant to her own practice, including paint pouring and contemporary reinterpretations of classical Asian painting. Condon has also run an art criticism blog, Raggedy Ann's Foot, since 2007. Career Condon has exhibited extensively in the US and internationally since 1998. She has participated in over 20 residencies and fellowships in Beijing, Taiwan, Shanghai, Spain, and the UK, along with locations across the United States, notably the MacDowell Colony in Peterborough, NH; the Everglades National Park; the Grand Canyon National Park; Yaddo in Saratoga Springs, NY; the Vermont Studio Center in Johnson, VT; and Ox-Bow School of Art and Artists Residency in Saugatuck, MI Selected Grants 2007 Pollock Krasner; 2008 Florida Individual Artist Fellowship; 2015 NY PULSE Prize (booth Emerson Dorsch); 2015 New York Studio School Mercedes Matter Alumni Award; 2018 Joan Mitchell Foundation Painters & Sculptors Program Grant Public Collections include: Art in Embassies Program (2008), Girls Club Collection (2008), JP Morgan Chase Art Collection (2015 and 2017), Martha and Jim Sweeny Collection of Contemporary Prints by American Women at Museum of Fine Arts, Saint Petersburg, FL (2015), Tampa Museum of Art (2016), and Perez Art Museum Miami (2017).

It is situated northwest of Squamish, east of Ossa Mountain, and north-northwest of Mount Tantalus, which is its nearest higher peak and the highest peak in the Tantalus Range. Unnamed glaciers surround the peak and precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Squamish River and Clowhom River. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1944 by V. Brink and B. McLellan. The mountain names in the Tantalus Range have a Greek mythology theme, and Pelion Mountain was named for the legendary Pelion mountain in Thessaly, upon which the Aloadaes are said to have attempted to pile Mount Pelion on top of Mount Ossa in their attempt to scale Olympus, home of the Greek gods. The mountain's name was officially adopted on June 6, 1957, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Pelion Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. July through September offer the best months to catch favorable weather for climbing Pelion. Climbing Routes Established climbing routes on Pelion Mountain: * Southwest Ridge - First Ascent 1944 * Northwest Ridge - FA 1968 * Northeast Ridge - FA 1969 * North Face - Approaches may be made via Sigurd Creek Trail or Pokosha Creek.

Her recording career spanned the 1940s to the 1970s.  Early life  Sarah Gorby was born in 1900 in Kishinev (Chisinau), then part of Tsarist Russia, now capital of Moldova. Her parents, Zeylik Khaimovich Gorbach (originally from Stara Ushytsia) and his wife Beyla Kipelman had emigrated to Kishinev from Poland. During her childhood, the Gorby house was largely Russian-speaking. Gorby left Kishinev at age 17 to study music in Ia»ôi, Romania, where she married Joseph Goldstein, a publisher who spoke both Romanian and Yiddish. Due to this cosmopolitan background, in her life she spoke many languages fluently. Her main language was Russian, her second language Yiddish, and she also spoke French, Romanian, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, German, and English well. She moved to Rome and then to Paris in the 1920s, but returend to Ia»ôi every summer until the outbreak of World War II to visit her husband. She also toured South America regularly during the 1930s. For a time in the 1930s she performed with her husband's last name (Sarah Goldstein) before switching to the stage name Sarah Gorby.  Music career  In 1940, Gorby and her husband emigrated to Haiti and Gorby continued on to the United States. Around 1949, Gorby returned to Paris; upon her husband's death in Haiti in the 1950 she settled permanently in Paris. After settling in Paris she recorded quite a lot under the label Eledisc, which was then releasing many Yiddish language singers. She also continued to tour regularly and spent months of the year away from France in places such as Mexico, South America, South Africa, and Israel. A noteworthy feature of her music was that she continued to sing in her native Bessarabian Yiddish dialect for much of her career.

The bar is known to be \\"home to a menagerie of misfits, from strippers and poets to longshoremen and merchant marines.\\" Notable patrons have included Thelonious Monk, Jack Hirschman, Warren Hinckle, and Herb Caen.  Richard \\"Specs\\" Simmons  The bar founder, Richard \\"Specs\\" Simmons, was born in 1928 in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. He was raised by a working-class Jewish family. His father and uncle worked as sheet metal workers, and they occasionally worked as bookies. As a youth, Simmons worked in the family business. In 1948, he decided to leave Boston due to his left-wing politics. He became a merchant marine and spent time in Europe. He first arrived in San Francisco as a merchant marine. However, he relocated to Los Angeles, California for one year, where he did metalwork. In 1951, he returned to San Francisco. Initially, he lived in the Western Addition neighborhood, and then moved to North Beach in a flat above City Lights Bookstore. He worked as a bartender at Vesuvio Cafe for one year, where he met his wife, Sonia Marantz. Like Simmons, she was a working-class Jew, originally from the East Coast. Simmons proceeded to work in metalwork for 15 years. Simmons was nicknamed \\"Specs\\" when he worked in construction, due to the eyeglasses that he wore.  Bar history  In 1968, Simmons and his wife, Sonia, opened the bar at 12 Adler Place (now called William Saroyan Place), an alley off Columbus Avenue, in North Beach. It is believed that Simmons opened the bar with royalties from the \\"MTA\\" song, performed by The Kingston Trio. This occurred because, in 1955, Simmons had met Will Holt while working as a waiter at the Purple Onion nightclub in New York City. Simmons introduced Holt to the \\"MTA\\" song, which he had learned as a low-level volunteer for the Walter A. O'Brien mayoral candidacy in Boston. The song had been a core part of the O'Brien campaign. Holt went on to perform and record the song in 1957, and the Kingston Trio then released a chart-topping version of the song in 1959. When Simmons took over the 12 Adler location, it already had a storied past. The space, originally built in 1850, had served as a Chinese Joss House before being destroyed in the 1906 earthquake and fires. It was then rebuilt in 1911, and it served as a speakeasy (1919-33) during prohibition. In 1937, the space became a social/political club for Alaska fishermen, followed by a serviceman's bar (1941-45). After the war, it became bohemian hangout (1945-48). In the early 1950s, the space was a lesbian bar called Tommy's Place/12 Adler Place, where an infamous 1954 police raid took place. Afterward, the location became the nightclub \\"Frank's,\\" owned by Frank Guidera, which featured Middle Eastern music, jazz music, and bellydancers. However, in 1965, North Beach nightlife changed when San Francisco legalized topless dancing and figures such as Carol Doda danced at the Condor Club. Simmons explained, \\"By that time North Beach turned into this big topless thing. There were only a few spots for locals to hang out. I was sick of swinging a hammer and I figured, maybe I‚Äôd find a joint.\\" Specs' was opened as a working-class union bar, and Simmons cited the William Saroyan play, \\"The Time of Your Life,\\" as an inspiration for the bar. Simmons was a vocal defender of labor unions. For this reason, the bartenders at Specs' were unionized, as they remain today. They also receive benefits and retirement. The bartenders can refuse to make any drink that they don't want to make, and they can refuse service to anyone for any reason. The bartenders are currently members of Local 2, a union for hospitality workers in San Francisco. Specs' served as the meeting grounds for various people, including sailors, poets, artists, musicians, strippers, union organizers, activists, and neighborhood locals. The bar was located near the Port of San Francisco, thereby attracting dock workers and sailors, until dock work largely moved to the East Bay. A strip club was located above the bar, and strippers used the bar bathrooms through a staircase that connected the two businesses. The staff of Processed World, an anarchist magazine, regularly met at the bar between 1982-84. On Wednesday nights, the bar was often a meeting place for socialist writers and poets. The Revolutionary Poets Brigade, a local group of radical and socialist poets, conducted meetings at the bar on Wednesday nights. The Brigade includes Jack Hirschman, who has been a longtime, regular patron of the bar. The editor of Left Curve, Csaba Polony, also patronized the bar on Wednesday nights. Many customers have had FBI files on them, including Simmons, who was involved in left-wing politics in the 1940s and 1950s. Over the years, Specs' became well- known for its decor, clientele, and unique characteristics. It is decorated with idiosyncratic items, some of which came from sailors and dockworkers. Items include taxidermy, Inuit carvings, propaganda posters, letters and postcards sent from around the world, a petrified walrus penis bone, and an old piano in the back. Customers can order one food item: edam cheese, which is cut from a huge wheel, with saltine crackers. As described in Hoodline: > \\"Specs' refusal to run his business according to anyone else's playbook was > palpable in almost every decision he made. The bar itself almost defies > description: a low-ceilinged, dark, and narrow room lined with curio > cabinets, inside each of which are trophies, trinkets, artwork, > idiosyncratic miscellany, totems, and plenty of socialist and union > propaganda.\\" For decades, Specs' hosted bi-annual \\"Ancient Rome\\" parties, which occurred during April and August. At these events, people were invited to a free feast, which included shucked oysters and clams. The feast was paid for by Simmons and also included community contributions. The parties could sometimes extend for 12 hours. As one longtime regular recounted, > \\"The line before the door opened for the party could be dozens deep. And > everyone‚Äôs welcome. Even the people who‚Äôve been 86ed. It was like Specs‚Äô > holy days of forgiveness, renewal, and plenty.‚Äù In 2016, Specs' was one of nine businesses to be named a \\"legacy\\" business in San Francisco. This enabled the bar to begin having ten-year leases, rather than the 5-year lease that they had continually renewed since the bar's opening. Simmons continued to occupy his North Beach flat into his old age. In October 2018, Simmons died at 84 years old, after battling Parkinson's disease. The bar remains open. Simmons' daughter, Elly Simmons, is co-owner of the bar.

The song was released on his 1979 album, Squeezing Out Sparks. Written about abortion, the song originated as a country-style shuffle before Parker and producer Jack Nitzsche changed it to a slower acoustic ballad. Though not released as a single, the song has since become one of Parker's most famous songs. The song has seen critical acclaim and has appeared on compilation and live albums. It has since been covered by Joe Jackson and Bob Geldof. Background Parker wrote \\"You Can't Be Too Strong\\" in his parents' home, after coming home from a Wreckless Eric concert that he made a guest appearance in. Parker characterized the song as \\"something that I just tossed off, and I thought, 'I don't know about this'.\\" Lyrically, the song is about abortion. The song was inspired by an event that happened to a close friend of Parker's. Parker later told Australian music magazine Roadrunner that the song was based on an Australian experience and that the lyrical reference to Luna Park came from hearing that it had burned down. In 1979, Parker elaborated on the song's meaning: Of the song's political meaning, he said, \\"I get fairly rankled when people ask whether it's pro- or anti-abortion. I don't deal with such simplicities. It's about being involved in an event.\\" In another interview, Parker said the song was \\"about ramming my fist so far down your throat you'll need to get a vasectomy to get it out.\\" The song also contains the phrase that gave the Squeezing Out Sparks album its name. The song was originally written with a country-style arrangement, but producer Jack Nitzsche convinced Parker to slow the song down to reflect the serious subject matter. Parker said, \\"[The song] started as a fairly uptempo country song until producer Jack Nitzsche realized that the lyrics were pretty heavy and got me to slow it way down. A very good idea!\\" Parker attributed the song's \\"weight\\" to this new arrangement. Release \\"You Can't Be Too Strong\\" was first released on Parker's fourth studio album, Squeezing Out Sparks, in March 1979. Though not released as a single, the song did appear as the B-side to the Scandinavian-only single release of \\"Nobody Hurts You.\\" The song also appeared on the Parker 1993 compilation album Passion is No Ordinary Word: The Graham Parker Anthology. Of the song's inclusion on the compilation, Parker said, \\"I don't know about 'You Can't Be Too Strong.' It's been sort of a bit overdone, I think. You know, they really wanted to take quintessential stuff and I think mostly they've done that.\\" The song also appeared as the title track to the compilation You Can't Be Too Strong: An Introduction to Graham Parker & the Rumour. A live version of the song recorded in Philadelphia in 1988 has appeared on the Parker live album Live! Alone in America. Alongside the rest of Squeezing Out Sparks, \\"You Can't Be Too Strong\\" has appeared in live form on Live Sparks. Of performing the song live, Parker said of performing the song live in 1979, \\"Every night I got off singing that. It was great because the audience loved it. Girls cried and stuff which kind of gets you into it.\\" Reception and legacy Steven Rosen of American Songwriter said that \\"You Can't Be Too Strong\\" was \\"maybe his greatest song, is the equal of Costello's 'Alison' or anything by Dylan.\\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic describes the song as one of the two \\"centerpieces\\" of Squeezing Out Sparks, alongside \\"Passion Is No Ordinary Word\\". Erlewine writes that the two songs \\"indicate that [Parker's] traditionalist musical tendencies are symptomatic of a larger conservative trend. But no one ever said conservatives made poor rock & rollers, and Parker's ruminations over a lost past give him the anger that fuels Squeezing Out Sparks, one of the great rock records of the post-punk era.\\" The New York Times dubbed the song \\"a gripping retelling of an abortion,\\" while Trouser Press described the song as \\"a ballad full of disturbing imagery and emphatic phrasing which echoes the album title's judgmental metaphor.\\" Blues Magazine called the track \\"fantastic\\" and \\"insanely beautiful.\\" The song's take on abortion has resulted in its appearance on National Review's \\"Top 50 Conservative Songs\\" list. In the article, John J. Miller writes, \\"Although it's not explicitly pro-life, this tune describes the horror of abortion with bracing honesty.\\" Parker said of the song's appearance on the list, \\"I guess you can take what you want from it...\\" Cover versions The song has been covered by fellow new wave musician Joe Jackson. Parker said of this, \\"I heard Joe did 'Strong,' yes. I'm well chuffed with that.\\" The song has also been covered by Bob Geldof.

Randall and Roger C. Steene in 1983. It belongs to the Indo-Pacific triggerfish genus Rhinecanthus.  Physical description  While the standard length of Rhinecanthus lunula holotype is 180 mm, the standard length of other type specimens ranges from 45.6 mm to 218 mm. R. lunula can be differentiated from other Rhinecanthus species by its soft ray count and distinct coloration. It usually has 26 soft dorsal rays (though sometimes only 25 are observed), between 22 and 24 anal soft rays, and 14 pectoral rays. The longest dorsal soft ray is 11.7 percent of the standard length. A broad, black bar exists on the caudal peduncle. Anterior to the caudal peduncle is a curved black line which gives the species its name ‚Äúlunula,‚Äù the Latin word for crescent. An orange-yellow band starts from the base of the upper lip and extends across the head to the pectoral base. In addition, the fish has a long snout, a concave dorsal profile, and an elongate body. The greatest body depth is between 2.2 and 2.6 percent of its standard length.Randall, J.E. and R.C. Steene (1983) Rhinecanthus lunula a new species of triggerfish from the South Pacific. Freshwater and Marine Aquarium (6)7: 45-51. Randall and Steene noted many differences between juvenile R. lunula and adults. For example, the caudal fin of a juvenile is rounded in a juvenile before becoming slightly double emarginate as it develops into an adult. Juveniles are also missing some of coloration that stands out in adults: there is no blackish area on the ventral side, black bars below the eyes are not well-developed, and the black crescent near the caudal peduncle (which gives the species its name) is also missing. However, there are also two yellow stripes present on juveniles that are not seen on adults. Additionally, the interorbital space is slightly concave in juveniles but becomes slightly convex in adults.  Distribution  A rare species, R. lunula has a small geographic distribution. When first described as a species, R. lunula was only known to exist from the Pitcairn Islands to Queensland, Australia. The holotype of the species was collected by John E. Randall in a barrier reef near the Society Islands of Tahiti, and juvenile specimens were collected near Queensland, Australia. While most reported sightings of the species have occurred within the same geographic range noted by Randall and Steene, a single sighting of R. lunula has been recorded by scuba divers in Egypt. However, the fish seen in Egypt may have been misidentified, as other members of the Rhinecanthus, R. aculeatus' and R. rectangulus, are known to exist in Africa. Rhinecanthus lunula are generally found in the outer areas of coral reefs 10 meters or deeper. Though the maximum depth of their habitat is unknown, triggerfishes of the Balistidae are known to exist up to 50 meters deep. Habitat may differ by age for R. lunula, as it is known that Rhinecanthus aculeatus juveniles tend to live near beaches while adults tend to live on barrier reefs. Distribution of a given Balistid species among an ecosystem may also be influenced by their diet and the distribution of food sources.  Reproduction  A main characteristic of the triggerfish family Balistidae, to which Rhinecanthus lunula belongs, is a haremic mating system in which a male has multiple female mates.

Sawyer for the Original Nashville Students. Published in 1884. The Original Nashville Students, also referred to as the Original Tennessee Jubilee and Plantation Singers, the Nashville Students, and H. B. Thearle's Nashville Students, were an ensemble of eight or nine African-American jubilee singers. The moniker ‚Äújubilee singer‚Äù was coined by George White for his a cappella group The Fisk Jubilee Singers. This was primarily a reference to the Jewish year of jubilee described in Leviticus 25. Additionally, jubilation elicits connections with emancipation and liberation, drawing on emotions of nationalist pride from both African American and white audiences. Adopting this title allowed the singers to brand themselves as those who were formerly enslaved, but who had triumphantly risen out of their oppression.  History  The Original Nashville Students, who were neither students nor from Nashville, seem to have formed in Chicago in 1882. As ‚Äúthe Original Tennessee Jubilee and Plantation Singers,‚Äù they toured small towns on the western lecture circuit, led by the World Lyceum Bureau and its proprietors H. T. Wilson and Harry B. Thearle. On their 1882 tour, they performed in YMCAs, libraries, town halls, churches, and opera houses. Harry B. Thearle (1858-1914) was born to the prominent minister Reverend Fred G. Thearle, who early in his career had been involved with ‚Äúcolored Sunday schools in the south,‚Äù and later managed the Baptist Book Publishing Company. Additionally, he was an active member of the church choir. This appreciation for music and black folk culture seems to have made an impression on his son: as a lyceum agent, one of the first groups he hired was an ensemble of jubilee singers. That appreciation for black folk culture seems to have been passed down to his son, as one of the first groups he hired as a lyceum agent was an ensemble of jubilee singers. By 1883, the group took on a new name: the Nashville Students, and later added ‚ÄúOriginal.‚Äù There was a dual purpose to this name change: there was an over-saturation of groups with ‚ÄúTennessee‚Äù in their name, and ‚ÄúOriginal‚Äù was meant to distinguish themselves. Perhaps more importantly, ‚ÄúNashville Students‚Äù elicits connections with and parallels to the Fisk Jubilee Singers of Fisk University, the originators of jubilee singing.  Music  The eight or nine members of the troupe performed spirituals and plantation sketches. Their program consisted of several parts. The first featured selections of traditional spirituals among other songs, the second featured soloists and a quartet, followed by a sketch in full plantation costume. The performance concluded with a comical musical sketch. Beginning as early as 1884, the Original Nashville Singers performed under the agency of the prestigious Redpath Lyceum Bureau, with Thearle remaining as their proprietor. The following is an excerpt from that season's program, as reported by Sandra Jean Graham in her book ‚ÄúSpirituals and the Birth of a Black Entertainment Industry‚Äù: \\"Note.-The ‚ÄúNASHVILLE STUDENTS‚Äù claim to possess cultivated voices and to be competent to sing what is commonly termed classical music; but it is not their mission, and they leave that field to the white concert companies. But they DO claim to sing the original Jubilee and Plantation Melodies, as sung by the children of bondage in their own peculiar manner in religious and social meetings and on the plantation. PART FIRST 1\\\\. Opening Chorus - Company 2\\\\. Keep a moving - Miss Nellie Scott Tipton 3\\\\. My Lord is Writing Down Time - Miss Franklin Hawkins 4\\\\. Every Day Will Be Sunday, bye and bye - Chas. Moore 5\\\\. How I long to go - Aug. L. Wright 6\\\\. ‚ÄúSelected‚Äù - Miss Helen Sawyer 7\\\\. Listen to dem ding dong bells. - W. J. Moon O, I'll Meet You Dar - Walter Tipton 9\\\\. Gospel Train - All Aboard Piano Selections - Geo. B. McPherson\\" This concert program complicates their claim to be singing the ‚Äúoriginal Jubilee and Plantation Melodies,‚Äù since ‚ÄúListen to Dem Ding Dong Bells‚Äù is a novelty song by Jacob J. Sawyer, who was their music director in at least 1884 and 1885, and both ‚ÄúEvery Day Will Be Sunday, bye and bye‚Äù and ‚ÄúO, I‚Äôll Meet You Dar‚Äù are commercial spirituals composed by Sam Lucas, an African American songwriter who had close ties with the Original Nashville Singers. These songs are not in fact ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù jubilee or plantation melodies, they are new compositions with a plantation theme. While many commercial spirituals were exploitative of the student jubilee tradition for comic potential, Lucas's spirituals generally seem to pay homage to the jubilee tradition. Lucas's songs, while not original to the era of slavery, were certainly written in a traditional style, with frequent nods to traditional spirituals. The complication to the Original Nashville Students‚Äô claim to originality or authenticity is less in their choice of repertoire, and more in an early concession to ‚Äúvariety‚Äù: a plantation sketch, complete with rustic costumes consisting of calico dresses, overalls, and bandannas. The Original Nashville Students performed these sketches as early as 1886, and also during their 1890-1891 season. While for the most part performing traditional music, the inclusion of a plantation sketch draws a connection to exploitative minstrel shows, which contradicts the true-to-tradition nature of the ensemble in both name (their allusion to the Fisk Jubilee Singers) and repertoire choice. ‚ÄúThe Nashville Students successfully incorporated variety entertainment in their programs while maintaining their reputation as concert artists. As the category of jubilee singer loosened, the boundaries between the altruistic and the purely commercial, between the folk and the popular, and between ‚Äòhigh‚Äô and ‚Äòlow‚Äô began to blur.‚Äù  Consolidation  The Original Nashville Students came about near the end of a short period of public enthusiasm for jubilee music - the industry was largely worn out by 1890. They were an outlier in that they continued touring through at least the 1890-1891 concert season. According to an excerpt published in Lynn Abbott and Doug Seroff‚Äôs book ‚ÄúOut of Sight: The Rise of African American Popular Music,‚Äù in 1895 the Original Nashville Students consolidated into the Mahara Minstrels, a minstrel company run by W. A. Mahara which toured throughout the southern United States and as far away as Cuba. On July 20, 1895, the New York Clipper reported: ‚ÄúNotes from the Mahara Minstrels,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe latest addition to the company is the original Nashville Students, eight in number. Mr. Mahara intends on making [them] a strong feature in the free concert given daily by his company. A portable stage will be erected each day in the most prominent street of the cities that they visit, and a performance of pleasing plantation and old time melodies will be rendered.‚Äù  Singers  In a companion website to her book ‚ÄúSpirituals and the Birth of a Black Entertainment Industry,‚Äù Sandra Jean Graham lists the complete personnel of the Original Nashville Students, as she does for over one hundred other jubilee troupes. It reads as follows: ‚ÄúPersonnel in 1885‚Äì1886: Helen Sawyer Moon (who sang with the Boston Ideals) and Cornelia Franklin Hawkins, soprano; Fannie Chinn (later a member of Glazier's Jubilee Singers) and Nellie Scott, alto; W. J. Moon and A. G. Wright, tenor; Walter Tipton, baritone; Charles Moore, bass; and George B. McPherson, solo pianist and accompanist. Personnel given in an 1887 program: Kitty Brown, Cornelia Hawkins, Chas. Moore, Clara Bell, L. E. Pugsley (later of the Tennessee Warblers), Fred. Carey, and Geo. Walley (HTC). Personnel in 1890, according to the Cleveland Gazette: Cora L. Watson, Clara Bell Carey, Mr. and Mrs. William Carter, Miss Gertie Heathcock, Joseph Hagerman (bass), and John M. Lewis (cited in Abbott and Seroff, Out of Sight, 171). As Abbott and Seroff point out, in fall 1892, bass singer Joseph Hagerman struck out on his own, forming a new troupe with baritone Ollie C. Hall. After that, Thearle went on to other things, and the troupe was effectively disbanded, although a Freeman column of 28 July 1900 noted that \\"Thearle's Nashville Students\\" had just returned from a year's trip through the Pacific (Out of Sight, 171‚Äì72). Ike Simond says the troupe \\"handled a great many people in its time\\" and recalls the following members (Old Slack's Reminiscence, 21): Cora Lee Watson, Mr. and Mrs. Fred Cary, Allie Hall, Neal Hawkins, and Ada Woods.\\" Jacob J. Sawyer served the group as music director from 1884-1885. \\"Sawyer had a varied career, working with the Hyers sisters combination starting in 1877 and later as pianist and/or music director for the Virginia Jubilee Singers, Haverly‚Äôs Minstrels, Sam Lucas‚Äôs various jubilee troupes, the Maryland Jubilee Singers, and the Nashville Students. With a body of eighteen instrumental compositions (mazurkas, waltzes, scottisches, polkas, and marches for solo piano), twenty- four vocal songs (eleven of which were commercial spirituals), and six arrangements - published over a mere six years (1879-1885) - he was also one of his generation‚Äôs most prolific songwriters.\\" References Category:African-American music Category:History of Chicago ","title":"Original Nashville Students"},{"id":"62380627","text":"Fernand Carton (4 September 1921 ‚Äì 16 November 2019) was a French linguist who specialized in Picardic dialects.

Cellular processes like genome duplication and cell division stop. It can be temporary or permanent. It is an artificial activation of naturally occurring cell cycle checkpoints, induced by exogenous stimuli controlled by an experimenter.  Model organisms  alt= In an academic research context, cell cycle arrest is typically performed in model organisms and cell extracts, such as Saccharomyces cervisiae (yeast) or Xenopus oocytes (frog eggs). Frog egg cell extracts have been used extensively in cell cycle research because they are relatively large, reaching a diameter of 1mm, and so contain large amounts of protein, making protein levels more easily measurable.  Purposes  There are a variety of reasons a researcher may want to temporarily or permanently prevent progress through the cell cycle. = Cell cycle synchronization = In some experiments, a researcher may want to control and synchronize the time when a group of cells progress to the next phase of the cell cycle. The cells can be induced to arrest as they arrive (at different time points) at a certain phase, so that when the arrest is lifted (for instance, rescuing cell cycle progression by introducing another chemical) all the cells resume cell cycle progression at the same time. In addition to this method acting as a scientific control for when the cells resume the cell cycle, this can be used to investigate necessity and sufficiency. Another reason synchrony is important is the control for amount of DNA content, which varies at different parts of the cell cycle based on whether DNA replication has occurred since the last round of completed mitosis and cytokinesis. Furthermore, synchronization of large numbers of cells into the same phase allows for the collection of large enough groups of cells in the same cycle for the use in other assays, such as western blot and RNA sequencing. = DNA damage repair = Researchers may be investigating mechanisms of DNA damage repair. Given that some of the mechanisms below of inducing cell cycle arrest involve damaging the DNA, this allows investigation into how the cell responds to damage of its genetic material. = Identification of in vivo protein function = Genetic engineering of cells with specific gene knockouts can also result in cells that arrest at different phases of the cell cycle. Examples include: * G1: Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast expressing dominant mutant alleles of CDC28 arrest in G1, which indicates that CDC28 is necessary for passage beyond the G1 phase. * S: Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast) expressing a temperature-sensitive mutant form of DNA polymerase delta (pol delta ts03) arrest in S phase. * G2: Fission yeast expressing some mutant forms of CDC2 unable to arrest in G2 in response to DNA damage, indicating the gene product is involved in G2 arrest. * M: A mutant screen of budding yeasts with mitotic arrest identified CDC16, CDC23, and CDC27 as key genes that, when mutated, cause arrest in mitosis.  G1 phase arrest  alt= G1 phase is the first of the four phases of the cell cycle, and is part of interphase. While in G1 the cell synthesizes messenger RNA (mRNA) and proteins in preparation for subsequent steps of interphase leading to mitosis. In human somatic cells, the cell cycle lasts about 18 hours, and the G1 phase makes up about 1/3 of that time. On the other hand, in frog, sea urchin, and fruit fly embryos, the G1 phase is extremely brief and instead is a slight gap between cytokinesis and S phase. = Alpha Factor = Œ±-factor is a pheromone secreted by Saccharomyces cervisiae that arrests the yeast cells in G1 phase. It does so by inhibiting the enzyme adenylate cyclase. The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to 3',5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP) and pyrophosphate. = Contact inhibition = Contact inhibition is a method of arresting cells when neighboring cells come into contact with each other. It results in a single layer of arrested cells of arrested cells, and is a process that is notably missing in cancer cells. The suspected mechanism is dependent on p27Kip1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. p27Kip1 protein levels are elevated in arresting cells. This natural process can be mimicked in a lab through the overexpression of p27Kip1, which results in induced cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. = Mimosine = Mimosine is a plant amino acid that has been shown to reversibly inhibit progression beyond G1 phase in some human cells, including lymphoblastoid cells. Its proposed mechanism of action is an iron/zinc chelator that depletes iron within the cell. This induces double-strand breaks in the DNA, inhibiting DNA replication. This may involve blocking the action of an iron-dependent ribonucleotide reductase. It may also inhibit transcription of serine hydroxymethyltransferase, which has zinc dependence. = Serum deprivation = In cell culture, serum is the growth medium in which the cells are grown and contains viral nutrients. The use of serum deprivation - partially or completely removing the serum and its nutrients - has been shown to arrest and synchronize cell cycle progression in G0 phase, for example in neonatal mammalian astrocytes and human foreskin fibroblasts. Amino acid starvation is a similar approach. When grown in a media without some essential amino acids, such as methionine, some cells arrest in early G1 phase.  S phase arrest  S phase follows G1 phase via the G1/S transition and precedes G2 phase in interphase and is the part of the cell cycle in which DNA is replicated. Since accurate duplication of the genome is critical to successful cell division, the processes that occur during S-phase are tightly regulated and widely conserved. Pre-replication complexes assembled before S phase are converted into active replication forks. Driving this conversion is Cdc7 and S-phase cyclin-dependent kinases, which are both upregulated after the G1/S transition. = Aphidicolin = Aphidicolin is an antibiotic isolated from the fungus Cephalosporum aphidicola. It is a reversible inhibitor of eukaryotic nuclear DNA replication that blocks progression past the S phase. Its mechanism is the inhibition of DNA polymerase A and D. A structural study found that this is thought to occur through binding the alpha active site of the polymerase and \\"rotating the template guanine,\\" which prevents deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) from binding. This S phase block induces apoptosis in HeLa cells. = 2,3-DCPE = 2small-molecule that induces S phase arrest. This was demonstrated in cancer cell lines and downregulates expression of B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-XL), an anti-apoptotic protein that prevents the release of mitochondrial contents like cytochrome c.  G2 phase arrest  G2 phase is the final part of interphase and directly precedes mitosis. It will only be entered in regular cells if the DNA replication in S phase is completed successfully. It is a period of rapid cell growth and protein synthesis during which the cell prepares itself for mitosis. = Destruction of cyclin mRNA = Cyclins are proteins that control progression through the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinases. Destruction of a cell's endogenous cyclin messenger RNA can arrest frog egg extracts in interphase and prevent them from entering mitosis. Introduction of exogenous cyclin mRNA is also sufficient to rescue cell cycle progression. One method of this destruction is through the use of antisense oligonucleotides, pieces of RNA that bind to the cyclin mRNA and prevent the mRNA from being translated into cyclin protein. This can actually be used to destroy phase-specific cyclins beyond just G2 \\\\- for instance, destruction of cyclin D1 mRNA by antisense oligonucleotides prevents progression from G1 phase to S phase.  Mitotic arrest  alt= Mitosis is the final part of the cell cycle and follows interphase. It is composed of four phases - prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase - and involves the condensation of the chromosomes in the nucleus, the dissolution of the nuclear envelope, and the separation of sister chromatids by spindle fibers. As mitosis concludes, the spindle fibers disappear and the nuclear membrane reforms around each of the two sets of chromosomes. After successful mitosis, the cell physically splits into two identical daughter cells in a process called cytokinesis, and this concludes a full round of the cell cycle. Each of these new cells could then potentially re-enter G1 phase and begin the cell cycle again. = Hydroxyurea = Hydroxyurea (HU) is a small molecule drug that inhibits the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), preventing the catalysis of converting deoxyribonucleotides (DNTs) to ribonucleotides. It is hypothesized that there is tyrosyl free radical within RNR that is disabled by HU. The free radicals are necessary for the reduction of the DNTs and are scavenged by HU instead. HU has been show to arrest cells in both S phase (healthy cells) and immediately before cytokinesis (mutant cells). = Nocodazole = Nocodazole is a chemical agent that interferes with the polymerization of microtubules. Cells treated with nocodazole arrest with a G2 or M phase DNA content, which can be verified with flow cytometry. From microscopy it has been determined they do enter mitosis but they cannot form the spindles necessary for metaphase because the microtubules cannot polymerize. Research into the mechanism has hinted at it potentially preventing tubulin from forming its alpha/beta heterodimer. = Taxol = Taxol works in the opposite way of nocodazole, instead stabilizing the microtubule polymer and preventing it from disassembly. It also causes M phase arrest, as the spindle that is supposed to pull apart sister chromatids is unable to disassemble. It acts through a specific binding site on the microtubule polymer, and as such does not require GTP or other cofactors to induce tubulin polymerization. = Temperature = Temperature has been shown to regulate HeLa cell cycle progression. Mitosis was found to be the most temperature-sensitive part of the cell cycle. Pre- cytokinesis mitotic arrest was visible through accumulation of cells in mitosis in below-normal temperatures between 24-31¬∫C (75.2-87.8¬∫F).  Verification  There are several methods that can be used to verify that cells have been arrested in the proper phase. = Flow cytometry = Flow cytometry is a technique of measuring physical and chemical characteristics of a population of cells using lasers and fluorophore dyes covalently linked to protein markers. The stronger the signal, the more of a particular protein is present. Staining with DNA dyes propidium iodide or 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) allows delineation or sorting of cells between G1, S, or G2/M phases. = Immunoblotting = Immunoblotting is the detection of specific proteins in a tissue sample or extract. Primary antibodies recognize and bind the protein in question, and secondary antibodies are added that recognize the primary antibodies. The secondary antibody is then visualized through staining or immunofluorescence, allowing indirect detection of the original target protein. Immunoblotting can be performed to detect the presence of cyclins, proteins that regulate the cell cycle. Different classes of cyclins are up- and down-regulated at different parts of the cell cycle. Measurement of the cyclins from an extract of an arrested cell can determine what phase the cell is in. For example, a peak of cyclin E protein would indicate the G1/S transition, a cyclin A peak would indicate late G2 phase, and a cyclin B peak would indicate mitosis. = Fluorescence ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicaton (FUCCI) = FUCCI is a system that takes advantage of cell cycle phase-specific expression of proteins and their degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Two fluorescent probes - Cdt1 and Geminin conjugated to fluorescent proteins - allow for real-time visualization of the cell cycle phase a cell is in.

She was inducted into the College of Fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering in 2019 for contributions in novel cancer therapeutics, vaccine immunogenicity prediction, and public health emergency preparedness with successful implementation and broad impact. False statements on memberships Lee was a co-director for the multi- university NSF I/UCRC Center for Health Organization Transformation for 10 years. The modest grant from NSF ($40,000 per year) was leveraged to build strong collaborative relationships with Atlanta healthcare centers and hospitals (members). Members provided students with first-hand clinical experience where they learnt directly on site, worked alongside nurses and physicians, observed surgeries in the operating room, documented treatment processes and patient care in the emergency department, and the intensive care units, etc. According to NSF site and court document \\"Multi-university Phase II and Phase III sites must have a minimum of $175,000 in cash membership fees and a minimum of three full members. After the first year of Phase II or Phase III, each site must show $175,000 minimum annually in membership fees including in-kind contributions. In-kind contributions considered to be part of the $175,000 must be approved by the Industrial Advisory Board (IAB).\\" Lee's hospital members paid $50,000 cash to Georgia Tech in Phase II Year 1 as membership fee. They also paid for background screening, drug tests, parking, and in some cases liability insurance, and provided IDs for all participating students each year. Lee counted membership according to the NSF criteria: she counted the cash hospitals paid for in their partnership collaboration. The members also provided in-kind contributions, including hospital access, patient data, and HIPAA training that helped shape students' intellectual growth and career-preparation. The Georgia Tech team had access to over 2.7 million patients' data. The generous contribution of members helped train over 100 students with over 50% female students. Members worked with Lee and students on important hospital projects where true evidence-based health transformation was carried out. Students gain unique hands-on experience with big-data analytics and successful implementation experiences, expanding the innovation capacity of our nations' competitive workforce. Lee also sponsored 400 under-served K8-12 students on campus (> 50% female, 97% African American and Hispanic) to introduce them to center research, offer hands-on learning to gain insight into college life and STEM research experience. By all measures, the I/UCRC center led by Lee was a tremendous success in terms of its technical progress, educational value and societal impact. with numerous projects garnered practice excellence awards. The NSF Office of Inspector General disagreed with the counting of membership, rather they considered only cash flow into Georgia Tech as membership fee. On September 18, 2019 the National Science Foundation General Council issued a final Notice of Administrative Action regarding the NSF Office of the Inspector General Report of Investigation, Unfortunately, U.S. Attorney's office refused to drop charges. In December 2019, Lee plead guilty in the U.S. District Court to lying to National Science Foundation (NSF) investigators and falsifying membership certificate for a $40,000 NSF grant. In August 2020, a federal judge gave Lee a lighter sentence than was requested by the prosecution, so that she can continue her work on fighting the COVID-19 pandemic in a timely manner. Lee was sentenced to sixty days of home confinement, to start in the spring of 2021. The case is unusual in three aspects: the U.S. Attorney refused to dismiss the charges. Georgia Tech denied repeated requests from top U.S. health officials to restore Lee's access to her computers while COVID-19 raged across the country. U.S. District Judge Steve Jones took the exceptional step of thanking Lee for her service to the nation and urged her to continue her important work.

It is a satire of Nazism, and was staged on Broadway shortly after World War II began in Europe. The plot is a whodunit about the murder of a German consul in the United States. The play was adapted as a movie of the same name in 1943. History Otto Preminger directed and starred as the German consul in the Broadway production. After a preview in Princeton, New Jersey in October, the play opened on November 3, 1939, at the Plymouth Theatre, where it ran for 264 performances. Preminger reprised the role for a national tour in the summer of 1940. Plot Officer Finkelstein, a Jewish policeman, is assigned to protect Karl Baumer, the consul for Nazi Germany in an American city. While hosting a group of people listening to a radio broadcast of a speech by Adolf Hitler, Baumer is apparently murdered. Finkelstein's investigation discovers that each of the others present has a motive for murdering Baumer. Dr. Jennings paid to get relatives out of Germany, only to discover Baumer has cheated him. Sophie Baumer hated her husband's cruelty and amorality. Baumer threatened to expose the Jewish ancestry of Baron Max von Alvenstor, and planned to kill Otto Horst. Thomas Denny, an American journalist, hates Baumer's Nazi ideology. All the suspects are found to be innocent; Baumer accidentally drank poison that he had prepared to murder one of his guests.

The studio shelved the project for about a year, but William Goetz, serving as interim studio head while Darryl F. Zanuck was fulfilling his military duty, greenlighted the project in April 1942. Ernst Lubitsch was initially assigned to direct. Goetz wanted Preminger to reprise his role of Baumer, but Preminger insisted he wanted to direct as well. Preminger convinced Goetz by offering to direct for free and to withdraw from directing (but remain as Baumer) if Goetz was unhappy with his work at the end of the first week of filming. Preminger hired Samuel Fuller to rewrite the script. The film was released in 1943, with comedian Milton Berle as Finkelstein. Preminger did play Baumer, and Edward McNamara also reprised the role of Mulrooney.

He was tied to a tree, brutally beaten on suspicion of bike theft; Ansari, a Muslim, was also forced to chant Hindu sayings. He died four days later. The incident came to light after a video of the lynching went viral. India's Prime Minister commented on this lynching in the Parliament of India. The accused were dropped from the murder charges by police. Events Tabrez Ansari was an orphan. He lived in Pune and worked there for seven years. He visited his hometown of Kadamdih occasionally on festivals. For Eid al-Fitr he visited Kadamdih. During the visit, on 17 June, he went to Jamshedpur with two friends on the bike of one of his friends. While returning from Jamshedpur, he was caught in the village Dhatkidih, near Kadamdih. He was tied to a tree by the mob and brutally beaten on the suspicion of bike theft. While the mob was beating him, a video was made by an unidentified person in the mob. He was forced to say religious slogans such as \\"Jai Shri Ram\\" and \\"Jai Hanuman\\", which translates from Hindi to \\"hail Lord Ram\\" or \\"victory to Lord Ram\\". In the past, attacks and lynchings fueled by rumours on WhatsApp have occurred in India, where the fast propagation of fake news has led to violent outcomes. Often the fake news involve rumours of child kidnapping or roaming bandits. On the morning of 18 June, the police were notified. Ansari was arrested and locked up in Saraykela Police Station. His wife received a call from him telling her what had happened. She informed her relatives. His uncle visited the station and saw that he was severely injured. He asked the police to provide medical treatment, but Ansari was sent to prison without it. Two days later. when his uncle went to see him in prison, Ansari was not in any condition to talk. His uncle again contacted the police for medical help, but he was denied. He tried to reach the medical officer of the prison too, but was unable to meet him. On the morning of 22 June, Ansari's family received news that his condition was severe, and he was admitted to Sadar Hospital. His relatives reached the hospital by 7:30 am, but by that time, he had died. Response The Tabrez family demanded that the perpetrators be tried under Section 302 (Punishment for murder) of the Indian Penal Code. Ansari's wife said that her husband was mercilessly beaten because he was a Muslim. She demanded justice. On 25 June, 11 arrests were made, and two policemen were suspended for \\"not reporting the seriousness of the issue to the higher authorities\\" and \\" a case of lynching on the very same day\\" A Special Investigation Team was assigned to investigate the case. The Saraikela-Kharsawan district police charged 11 of the 13 named accused in the case on 29 July. The murder charges were then dropped, but later reinstated. A medical panel of five members was formed to look into the death. The resulting medical report concluded that Tabrez Ansari suffered a skull fracture caused by a \\"hard and blunt object\\", a subarachnoid haemorrhage, and clotting of blood in the lower layer of the skull; and suggests that these injuries led to the cardiac arrest that resulted in Ansari's death. The consumption of poison was ruled out. On 9 September 2019, the police dropped the murder charges by giving cardiac arrest as the reason of death, which led to an uproar. Due to this, the police were accused of weakening the case. On 18 September 2019, the police filed a supplementary chargesheet after obtaining the opinion of a board of doctors of MGM Medical College and Hospital, reinstating the murder charges. The lynching resulted in public anger, debates on the use of \\"Jai Shri Ram\\" as an attack slogan and multiple protests, including one in New Delhi held near the parliament house, where protesters chanted slogans against the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and demanded an end to anti-Muslim violence. Modi commented on the lynching in parliament, that he was pained to hear about the incident and calling for \\"the strictest possible punishment to the accused\\". Rahul Gandhi, at the time President of the Indian National Congress, called the lynching a \\"blot on humanity\\". Vishwa Hindu Parishad called the lynching \\"a conspiracy of secularists\\", which VHP Joint General Secretary Surendra Jain blamed on \\"the Khan Market Mafia, which has repeatedly been maligning Hindu society, India and humanity.\\" See also * Violence against Muslims in India References External links *Newsreport including film of lynching on NDTV, 24 June 2019 Category:Lynching deaths in India Category:Anti-Muslim violence in India Category:Riots and civil disorder in India ","title":"2019 Jharkhand mob lynching"},{"id":"62381500","title":"I Made a Place"},{"id":"62381502","text":"DA-Group is a Finnish technology company providing advanced electronics and high technology solutions and products to extremely demanding conditions from the pressure of sea bed to the vacuum of space.

Statistics and Background  According to UNHCR, also known as The UN Refugee Agency, there are around 10,585 refugees dwelling in Indonesia that are officially registered by the organization as of July 2019. The majority of these migrants are from Afghanistan (56%), Somalia (10%), and Myanmar (5%). Others are from countries such as Sudan, Iran, Iraq, China, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, and Yemen. Most commonly, these refugees are fleeing from their countries due to ‚Äúwar, persecution due to their beliefs, and violations of their human rights.\\"  Human Rights Issues  alt= Refugees in Indonesia do not generally see Indonesia as their final destination. Most of them are just temporarily staying in Indonesia and waiting to get their cases processed by the UNHCR. They await transition to countries like USA, Canada and Australia. When the refugees first arrive in Indonesia they seek asylum status, and then await the time-consuming process to reach refugee status through UNHCR.When they are undergoing this process they are not entitled to social security, and cannot either find jobs or start their own business. As a result, they are encountering other problems such as poor livelihood and financial crisis once their savings are all spent. Recently, countries like USA and Australia have changed their policies, which result in these refugees being stranded in Indonesia, waiting for an indefinite resettlement.  Living Conditions  As the refugees are not permitted to work or initiate their own businesses they face many hardships and trials including \\"livelihood and financial difficulty, health, safety and security, lack of legal rights, mental health problems, boredom and education for their children.\\" alt= Kate Lamb, a journalist from The Guardian, reports that money is running short for these refugees settled in Kalideres due to the long period of waiting to be resettled. With issues like unemployment and unstable shelters, these refugees along with their families are exposed to diseases caused by the lack of sanitation. With no place to turn to, about 400 refugees are currently settled in the building located in Kalideres as stated by the journalist. Numerous tents are set up as temporary shelters as they wait to be resettled.  Government's Action  The President of Indonesia has already signed a petition called ‚ÄúThe Presidential Regulation on the Handling of Refugees‚Äù, in 2016 claiming that needs and safety information might be under the government's task in the future. In addition, the Government seeks to collaborate with UNHCR to carry out rules and regulations in order to improve the protection of the refugees that are settling in Indonesia.  Indonesian Laws and Regulations Concerning Immigration  \\"Indonesia is not a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or its 1967 Protocol, nor does it have a national refugee status determination center.\\" Because of that, refugees in Indonesia are temporarily detained so that their cases could be processed by the UNHCR and that they could move to their intended destination. Generally speaking, the Indonesian government and authorities hold an \\"attitude of tolerance\\" towards these temporary settlers, but they do not, nor are they required to provide for them essential life services such as food, shelter, and health care. Therefore, many refugees are suffering from problems resulting from such circumstances.

Biography  Mori was born on July 24, 1890 in Nagasaki, Japan. He was the son of the physician and community leader Iga Mori. Mori was raised in Japan by his grandmother, and grew up to study medicine at the Kyushu Imperial University and the Mayo Clinic. He moved to Hawaii in 1920 to practice medicine with his father. He earned a PhD in 1936 from the Tokyo Imperial University. He was one of the founders of the Choon Shisha, a tanka club in Honolulu, and also had a regular column in the Nippu Jiji. Mori married Misao Harada, daughter of Tasuku Harada, in 1921. They had four children. After she died in 1927, he remarried Ishiko Shibuya, a physician at the Kuakini Medical Center. They had two children together. On December 5, 1941, a reporter from the Yomiuri Shinbun called Mori to interview him about life in Hawaii. Mori's answers seemed suspicious to FBI agents who were monitoring the call. After Pearl Harbor was attacked two days later, he and Ishiko were accused of espionage and arrested. Mori was transferred to the Sand Island Internment Camp on January 5, 1942. He was then sent to incarceration camps in Angel Island, Lordsburg, and Santa Fe. He was finally transferred to the Crystal City camp in Texas, where he was reunited with his family. He and Ishiko worked as doctors in the camp, and were overwhelmed by the number of patients. However, they found the time to create a poetry club with Tokiji Takei, and to publish the camp's poetry anthology, Nagareboshi. Mori returned to Hawaii on December 10, 1945. He reopened his medical practice and restarted the Choonshisha with Takei, Otokichi Ozaki, and Kumaji Furuya.

Google started its development in 2007, as a tailored modification of TLS. Background The ALTS whitepaper was published in December 2017. According to it, development started in 2007. At that time the dominant Application layer protocols were SSL and TLS 1.1 (TLS 1.2 was only published as an RFC in 2008), those supported many legacy algorithms and had poor security standards. As Google was in full control over the machines that needed secure transport of RPCs, deployment of systems was relatively easy, and so Google developers could afford designing their own system from scratch. Another requirement that deemed a new system necessary is different trust models: in TLS, the server side is committed to its own domain name (and corresponding naming scheme), while Google needed the same identity (i.e. RPC) to be used with multiple naming schemes, in order to simplify microservice replication, load balancing and rescheduling between hosts. Details =Handshake protocol= The ALTS handshake protocol is based on authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange scheme, enjoying both perfect forward secrecy (access to current keys does not compromise future security) and session resumption (noticeable speedups in the protocol after the first session between the parties). Unlike TLS, in ALTS both parties ‚Äî server and client ‚Äî have a certificate proving their respective identities. The certificate chains to a trusted signing service verification key, with the leaf being an Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key, that is eventually used for key exchange. The elliptic curve used in the key exchange is Curve25519. The handshake protocol consists of four messages, sent in plaintext: * ClientInit, initiated by the client, and contains the client's certificate, list of available cipher suites, and a session resumption attempt; * ServerInit, sent by the server as a response, and contains its own certificate, chosen cipher suite, and optionally an encrypted resumption ticket; * ServerFinished, sent by the server (concatenated to the previous message in ALTS default implementation), and contains a handshake authenticator, i.e. HMAC over a known bitstring using the calculated session key; * ClientFinished, sent by the client, and contains a handshake authenticator, similarly to the one in ServerFinished. Once both parties computed the session key (record protocol in the whitepaper), they can start encrypting traffic with the symmetric encryption algorithm 128-bit AES, using mostly GCM as its mode of operation. On older machines, a Google developed VCM was used. The handshake protocol was verified using the ProVerif formal verification tool. =Session resumption= In order to avoid repeating computationally expensive operations, ALTS supports session resumption. The resumption tickets are created by either the server or the client, and may be used in the handshake protocol, if both parties hold the same resumption ticket, indexed by a resumption identifier. The resumption secret is used to derive the next session key, authenticator and encapsulated (independent) resumption ticket/identifier. =Perfect forward secrecy= Perfect forward secrecy (PFS) is not enabled by default in ALTS; however, it is supported. Instead of using an inherent PFS algorithm, ALTS achieves PFS by frequently rotating the certificates, which have a short lifespan (6, 20, or 48 hours; see ). Moreover, if PFS is enabled, it is also enabled for session resumption, by deriving the encryption keys from the resumption ticket using a pseudorandom function.

A software bot has an identity and potentially personified aspects in order to serve their stakeholders . Software bots often compose software services and provide an alternative user interface, which is sometimes, but not necessarily conversational. Software bots are typically used to execute tasks, suggest actions, engage in dialogue, and promote social and cultural aspects of a software project. The term bot is derived from robot. However, robots act in the physical world and software bots act only in digital spaces . Some software bots are designed and behave as chatbots, but not all chatbots are software bots. Erlenhov et al. discuss the past and future of software bots and show that software bots have been adopted for many years.  Usage  Software bots are used to support development activities, such as communication among software developers and automation of repetitive tasks. Software bots have been adopted by several communities related to software development, such as open-source communities on GitHub and Stack Overflow. GitHub bots have user accounts and can open, close, or comment on pull requests and issues. GitHub bots have been used to assign reviewers, ask contributors to sign the Contributor License Agreement, report continuous integration failures, review code and pull requests, welcome newcomers, run automated tests, merge pull requests, fix bugs and vulnerabilities, etc. The Slack tool includes an API for developing software bots . There are slack bots for keeping track of todo lists, coordinating standup meetings, and managing support tickets. The Chatbot company products further simplify the process of creating a custom Slack bot. In wikipedia, wikipedia bots automate a variety of tasks, such as creating stub articles, consistently updating the format of multiple articles, and so on.  Taxonomies and Classification Frameworks  Lebeuf et al. provide a faceted taxonomy to characterize bots based on a literature review. It is composed of 3 main facets: (i) properties of the environment that the bot was created in; (ii) intrinsic properties of the bot itself; and (iii) the bot's interactions within its environment. They further detail the facets into sets of sub-facets under each of the main facets. Paikari and van der Hoek defined a set of dimensions to enable comparing software bots, applied especifically to chatbots. It resulted in six dimensions: * Type: the main purpose of the bot (information, collaboration, or automation) * Direction of the \\"conversation\\" (input, output, or bi-directional) * Guidance (human-mediated, or autonomous) * Predictability (deterministic, or evolving) * Interaction style (dull, alternate vocabulary, relationship-builder, human-like) * Communication channel (text, voice, or both) Example of notable bots * Dependabot and Renovatebot update software dependencies and detect vulnerabilities. (https://dependabot.com/) * Probot is an organization that create and maintain bots for GitHub. The example bots using Probot are the following. ** Auto Assign (https://probot.github.io/apps/auto-assign/) ** license bot (https://probot.github.io/) ** Sentiment bot (https://probot.github.io/apps/sentiment-bot/) ** Untrivializer bot (https://probot.github.io/apps/untrivializer/) * Refactoring-Bot (Refactoring- Bot): provides refactoring based on static code analysis * Looks good to me bot (LGTM) is a Semmle product that inspects pull requests on GitHub for code style and unsafe code practices.  Issues and threats  Software bots may not be well accepted by humans. A study from the University of Antwerp has compared how developers active on Stack Overflow perceive answers generated by software bots. They find that developers perceive the quality of software bot- generated answers to be significantly worse if the identity of the software bot is made apparent. By contrast, answers from software bots with human-like identity were better received. In practice, when software bots are used on platforms like GitHub or wikipedia, their username makes it clear that they are bots, e.g., DependaBot, RenovateBot, User:DatBot, User:SineBot. Bots may be subject to special rules. For instance, the Github terms of service does not allow \`bot\` but accepts \`machine account\`, where a \`machine account\` has two properties: 1) a human takes full responsibility of the bot's actions 2) it cannot create other accounts.

Darmstadt 2006, Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, . An exact definition is therefore not possible. The honorable merchant must always be seen in the context of his time. Nevertheless, there is a basic framework that has determined the behaviour of honorable merchants since the Middle Ages.  History  Since the 12th century, the model of the Honourable Merchant has demonstrably been taught in European merchant manuals. His European beginnings can be found in medieval Italy and the North German League of Hanseatic Cities.Daniel Klink: Der Ehrbare Kaufmann ‚Äì Das urspr√ºngliche Leitbild der Betriebswirtschaftslehre und individuelle Grundlage f√ºr die CSR-Forschung.

The model of the honourable merchant came to Italy in 1494 and is attributed to Luca Pacioli: \\"There is nothing higher than the word of the good merchant, and so they affirm their oaths by saying: In the honour of the true merchant\\".Carl Peter Kheil, √úber einige √§ltere Bearbeitungen des Buchhaltungs-Tractates von Luca Pacioli, 1896, German, P. 9  Criticism  The public criticism of the model of the Honourable Merchant refers to the assumed remoteness from reality of the model. By citing negative examples of entrepreneurs and managers, it attempts to show that respectable behaviour is of no significance in reality. Furthermore, a romanticization of the historical concept of merchant is deplored, also with reference to negative examples.Rainer Trampert [http://jungle-world.com/artikel/2009/32/36904.html Ehre Blut und Pulverdampf Der deutsche Mythos vom ‚Äûehrbaren Kaufmann‚Äú].

Life  Joachim's father Michael was chancellor of the prince-abbot; he moved to Wil for confessional reasons. Joachim took his vows on 17 June 1563. He started studying at the university of Dillingen in 1564 and then studied at the Paris Jesuit College between 1570 and 1574. In Paris, he became witness to the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre and in two letters to the Saint Gall Abbot Otmar Kunz he told about the violent events. He is listed as deacon of Saint Gall on 8 April 1576 and was elected abbot on 29 January 1577. The papal confirmation was conferred by Gregory XIII on 16 April 1578, while the benediction was performed by the Auxiliary Bishop Balthasar Wurer of Konstanz on 24 June 1578. On 27 November 1578, Joachim Opser was chosen by Beatus a Porta and the Chur cathedral chapter to be auxiliary bishop and thus also designated successor of the acting bishop. However, he was met by strong opposition because he did not come from one of the Three Leagues and thus had to forego his appointment to Chur.  Works  During his abbacy at Saint Gall, Joachim Opser repeatedly received papal nuncios, who on their visitations called for reforms after the model of the council of Trent. Joachim indeed seems to have demanded stern discipline from his monks as a result. Apparently this led to open conflict in one part of the convent in 1590. The abbot was accused of demanding a level of discipline from his subordinates he was not subject to himself. The nuncio in Lucerne launched an investigation which concluded that those accusations were baseless. Nevertheless, Abbot Joachim was forced to loosen his policy of uncompromising discipline. During Joachim Opsers abbacy, the abbey was in a state of financial distress, which necessitated the sale of estates in Neu- Ravensburg and Wangen im Allg√§u. The abbey's financial hardship was exacerbated by the plague which was spreading in 1594 and caused many monks to leave the abbey. Abbot Joachim stayed in Saint Gall and died during a sermon on 24 August 1594. He was buried on the left side of the minster choir by the altar of Saint Benedict. His legacy consists of the reformist document Liber exercitiorum spiritualium.

The series, created by Richard and Esther Shapiro and produced by Aaron Spelling, revolves around the Carringtons, a wealthy family residing in Denver, Colorado. Season six stars John Forsythe as millionaire oil magnate Blake Carrington; Linda Evans as his wife Krystle; Jack Coleman as Blake and Alexis's earnest son Steven; Gordon Thomson as Blake and Alexis's eldest son Adam; Pamela Bellwood as Steven's ex- wife, Claudia; Heather Locklear as Krystle's niece and Steven's ex-wife Sammy Jo; Michael Nader as Alexis's husband Dex Dexter; Catherine Oxenberg as Blake and Alexis's youngest daughter, Amanda; Michael Praed as Amanda's husband Prince Michael of Moldavia; Diahann Carroll as Blake's half-sister Dominique Deveraux; Ted McGinley as Clay Fallmont; and Joan Collins as Alexis Colby, Blake's ex-wife and the mother of Adam, Fallon, Steven, and Amanda. The season also features Maxwell Caulfield as Jeff's cousin, Miles Colby; Christopher Cazenove as Blake's brother, Ben Carrington; Kate O'Mara as Alexis' sister Caress Morell; and George Hamilton as con man Joel Abrigore. A spin-off series, The Colbys, was launched in November 1985, starring John James and Emma Samms as their Dynasty characters, Jeff Colby and Fallon Carrington. To set up the new series, Dynasty introduced the series regulars of The Colbys, including Charlton Heston as wealthy Colby Enterprises CEO Jason Colby; Stephanie Beacham as his wife Sable; Tracy Scoggins as their daughter Monica, twin sister to Miles; Claire Yarlett as Bliss Colby; Jason and Sable's youngest daughter; Barbara Stanwyck as Jason's sister Constance Colby; and Ricardo Montalban as shipping tycoon Zach Powers. Development The season six premiere episode \\"The Aftermath\\" garnered a 28.1 rating, higher than any other episode in the entire series, as viewers wanted to see who survived the \\"Moldavian Massacre\\" cliffhanger from the season five finale. The only casualties were Steven's boyfriend Luke Fuller (William Campbell), and Jeff's love interest Lady Ashley Mitchell (Ali MacGraw). In the 2006 CBS special Dynasty Reunion: Catfights & Caviar, Gordon Thomson stated that it was the \\"follow-up\\" that was the letdown, not the cliffhanger itself. John James stated in the 2001 episode of E! The True Hollywood Story featuring Dynasty that the Moldavian Massacre was when the show \\"maxed out\\" and \\"overdosed\\" on outrageousness.E! True Hollywood Story: Dynasty (2001) Joan Collins was conspicuously absent from the season six opener, as she was in a tense contract renegotiation with the show, seeking an increased salary. She returned to the series in the season's second episode. Although still a top ten series, Dynasty dropped from first to seventh place in the ratings for its sixth season. A spin-off series, The Colbys, was launched in November 1985, starring John James and Emma Samms as their Dynasty characters, Jeff Colby and Fallon Carrington. Plot Spurned by Blake, Alexis finds his estranged brother Ben and the duo successfully plot to strip Blake of his fortune. Alexis's sister Caress Morell also appears and causes trouble for Alexis. Steven's budding relationship with the closeted Bart Fallmont (Kevin Conroy) is ruined by Adam's business-motivated public revelation that Bart is gay. Krystle is held hostage and replaced by lookalike Rita (also played by Evans), who is working with a con man to rob Blake. Amanda, who has divorced Prince Michael, fights with Sammy Jo for the favors of Clay Fallmont.

She is the first ever organizer and commissioner of Mongolia Pavilion at La Biennale di Venezia.  Early life and career  Gantuya was born in 1968, in Mandalgovi, Mongolia. When she graduated high school, Gantuya was torn between math and art to select her major, as she had a strong passion for both. She is a bronze medalist from the National Mathematical Olympiad of Mongolia and participant of International Mathematical Olympiad in Finland, 1985. As socialist Mongolia did not encourage artistic endeavors, Gantuya decided to become an economist. She studied Macro Economic Planning in Leningrad Institute of Economics and Finance (present day Saint Petersburg State University of Economics and Finance) in 1980s and received her master's degree from Williams College, USA in Macroeconomic Policy in 2006. After the collapse of the socialist system in Mongolia, Gantuya worked for the Asian Development Bank, United States Agency for International Development and other institutions as an economic analyst and consultant, and later she had held strategic development positions in largest conglomerates in Mongolia, such as Tavan Bogd Group. In 2012, Gantuya quitted her successful career and founded Art Space 976+ (formerly known as 976 Art Gallery) with a desire to promote contemporary art of Mongolia. Within few years, Gantuya and her team managed Art Space 976+ becoming an important cultural hub of Ulaanbaatar city, by hosting experimental exhibitions, performances, and open discussions with leading contemporary artists of Mongolia, all the while collaborating with renowned international artists. Upon opening Art Space 976+, Gantuya quickly realized that contemporary art in Mongolia needed \\"a significant amount of support\\". Thus, she established a non-government organization Mongolian Contemporary Art Support Association (MCASA). Through MCASA, Gantuya commissioned the first ever participation of Mongolia at La Biennale di Venezia in 2015. Later she continued the endeavor by organizing the 2017 and the 2019 Mongolia Pavilions where she worked as a curator for the latter. Titled A Temporarily, \\"project stem[ed] from the curator‚Äôs ambition to transform ancient mediums of oral expression into contemporary form\\". It included a site-specific installation by Jantsankhorol Erdenebayar along with a sound installation made in collaboration with Carsten Nicolai and Mongolian traditional throat singers. The exhibition garnered an extensive media attention, marking it as one of the must visit pavilions of that year. Moreover, Gantuya has worked as an independent curator for multiple projects such as Echoes of the Void by Italian artist Maria Rebecca Ballestra , China Dolls by Canadian artist Nathalie Daoust and Nomad Spirit by Diaz & Riedweg and 5 Mongolian artists, including Munkhbolor Ganbold and Davaajargal Tsaschikher.

For the past 19 years, the Philippines was freed of any polio-related diseases. It was until September 14, 2019, when the disease began to resurface again through a positive test result done to a 3-year-old girl from the southern Philippines. After the confirmation of a second case from tests done on a 5-year-old boy, the government of the Philippines publicly declared the polio outbreak on September 19, 2019. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the Philippines was eradicated of polio in the year 2000.  Outbreak  On September 19, 2019, a polio outbreak was reported in the Philippines. After two polio cases were reported, the authorities inspected several places including Metro Manila and Davao City. Samples taken from several places across Manila were confirmed to contain \\"vaccine-derived polio virus\\" type 2 (VDPV2), similar to the pathogen found on the first two confirmed cases. The government decided to vaccinate all the children regardless of whether they have been affected by polio or not. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) have worked with the government of the Philippines in a massive polio vaccination campaign; other NGOs like the Red Cross are also collaborating in the campaign as well. Four cases have been confirmed as of November 5, 2019: the first was a three-year-old girl in Lanao del Sur with the other cases reported in Laguna, Maguindanao, and Sultan Kudarat. It is believed that the public's distrust in the country's poor healthcare system is a cause of the polio outbreak. This is not the first disease outbreak in the Philippines in 2019. In February 2019, a measles outbreak occurred as a result of public distrust in the Philippines' poor healthcare system. As of January 2019, the Philippines has been combating a dengue outbreak, the worst dengue outbreak that the Philippines has experienced since 2012. Like the measles outbreak, the dengue outbreak was also caused by public distrust of the dengue vaccination campaign in 2012.  Response  = Domestic = During this epidemic, WHO, UNICEF and other private medical communities are working hand in hand to help the Philippines Department of Health in conducting enormous vaccination runs throughout Metro Manila, Davao City, Marawi, and other major cities in the country. The campaign sought to end the rise of the deadly virus. According to the Philippine Red Cross, the duration of the mass vaccination run happened between October 14 and 27, 2019; the number of children they aimed to have vaccinated is 65,000 children. As of October 2, 2019, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has pledged US$336,700 from it relief funds in efforts to eradicate polio from the Philippines. = International = Not only is the outbreak proving a risk to citizens of the Philippines, but other neighboring countries are keeping watch on the spread of the disease as well. An advisory was released by the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia to the Philippines, in aiming to prevent the spread of polio.

Biography Eli Schechtman was born in the shtetl of Vas'kovychi Korestensky district near Zhytomyr in the Ukraine. He was the seventh of eight children in his family. He received traditional Jewish education at a cheder. Eli S—Åhechtman's mother died when he was eight years old, and his father took care of the children. Eli was forced to leave for Zhytomyr to study in a yeshiva at the age of thirteen. In 1926, Eli Schechtman went to Odessa ‚Äì a large intellectual center of Jewish life of that time ‚Äì where he studied literature at the Odessa Jewish Pedagogical Institute from 1929 to 1932. =Marriage= In 1929 Schechtman met Sheindl (Zhenia) Magazinnik, an actress in a Jewish theater–ú.–õ–æ–µ–≤, –£–∫—Ä–∞–¥–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –º—É–∑–∞ ,—Å—Ç—Ä.26 got married and in 1932 moved to Kharkiv, and later in 1936 to Kyiv. In 1934 Schechtman joined the Union of Soviet Writers as an active member, where his acceptance was sanctioned by Maxim Gorky, who was the chairman of the Union. During the 1930s Schechtman wrote three novels, all of which were published in Yiddish. He also translated the works of Ukrainian novelists to Yiddish. Schechtman family from left to right: Sheindl, Eli, Lara, Lea. =World War II= On the day following the commencement of Operation Barbarossa, and the bombing of Kyiv, Eli Schechtman, and his family were evacuated to Uzbekistan. In 1942 Schechtman voluntarily joined the Red Army. He was injured in 1944, but returned to the front line, and fought as an officer in the Russian army until the end of the war. In May 1945 he was part of the Russian forces who marched to Berlin, and in 1946-1948 he served near Weimar as the Cultural Attach√© of the Soviet Forces. =Imprisonment= In 1948 Schechtman left Germany and returned to the USSR. Between 1948 and 1962, the Schechtman's family lived in Kyiv in a communal apartment with 16 neighbours. He couldn't publish his novels In 1948, on the orders of Stalin, the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee was closed out, then the last Jewish newspaper and publishing house were closed. –ö–æ—Å—Ç—ã—Ä—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ –ì. –í.,–¢–∞–π–Ω–∞—è –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫–∞ –°—Ç–∞–ª–∏–Ω–∞: –≤–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å –∏ –∞–Ω—Ç–∏—Å–µ–º–∏—Ç–∏–∑–º,(2003),page 351-352 and the family struggled to survive, supported only by Sheindl's modest salary as a kindergarten teacher.–Ø–∫–æ–≤ –†–∞–±–∏–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á,\\"–ü–æ—á–µ–º—É –µ–≤—Ä–µ–∏ –Ω–µ –ª—é–±—è—Ç –°—Ç–∞–ª–∏–Ω–∞\\", –ì–ª–∞–≤–∞: –∑–∞–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–∏–µ –µ–≤—Ä–µ–π—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Ç–µ–∞—Ç—Ä–æ–≤, (2014), –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞ In March 1953, several days before the official announcement of Stalin's death, Eli Schechtman was imprisoned as Jewish nationalist and charged with espionage and Zionism.

A number of critics praised it as one of the best, or even the best, achievement of post-Holocaust Yiddish prose. The first page of Erev manuscript =Israel= In 1972 Eli Schechtman and with his wife emigrated to Israel. In 1973 he became the first author to receive an award from the Prime Minister of Israel, Golda Meir, \\"for literary work in Yiddish.\\" In 1975 a Hebrew translation of the first four parts of Erev were published. Eli settled in Jerusalem and began to struggle with the attitude to Yiddish - the language of most Holocaust victims - as to a foreign language in the Jewish state. In the 1980s and 1990s, he became even more critical to the historical and cultural approach of the Israeli establishment to the European diaspora and its culture. Although Schechtman was honored by several Israeli literary awards, he was dispirited by the status of the Yiddish language in Israelhamlet and generally remained suspended from the circle of local Yiddish writers. In 1991, Eli Schechtman, protesting the situation of Yiddish in Israel, refused to get involved in a two-volume Anthology of Yiddish poets and writers (who had ever lived in Israel), whose purpose was to give a complete picture of the Yiddish literature in the country. Schechtman's literary heritage was eulogized by the writer and literary critic Itche Goldberg in Yidishe Kultur.Yiddish Kultur, 1996, New York, was completely dedicated to Eli Schechtman. His full literary heritage is kept in the library of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. Eli Schechtman's grave Eli Schechtman died on January 1, 1996, and is buried next to his wife at a cemetery in Kiryat Bialik, Israel. Novels Schechtman began writing at the age of twelve. His earliest publication was in 1928: the two poems from the cycle \\"In shpil fun shneyen\\" (\\"In the Play of Snows\\") were published in (The Red World). His collection of stories, (At the Crossroads, 1930), and especially his novel (Plowed Stripes, 1932-1936, reprinted in 1941), established him as a prose writer. A prose stylist, he continued the tradition of such writers as Dovid Bergelson and Der Nister. Most of his literary characters are residents of Polesie, a wooded and marshy land between the Ukraine and Belarus. A collection of his short stories - (Polesie Forests) - was published in 1940. Upon his release from the Soviet prison, Schechtman began working on one of his major novels, Erev. This was the first novel published in the new and solely Yiddish magazine Sovetish Heymland, which appeared in the USSR in 1961, more than 20 years after the outbreak of WW2 and the defeat of Jewish culture. The first four books of the novel were serialized Sovetish Heymland and the first two books were published in a single volume by the Moscow publishing house Sovetsky Pisatel in 1965. It was translated into French by Rachel Ertel under the name √† la vielle de... in 1964. Into English it was translated under the original name Erev in 1967, by Joseph Singer. On the cover of this book, Eli Shekhtman is compared with Feodor Dostoevsky and Anton Chekhov.Erev, translated by Joseph Singer, [New York], 1967, Book cover Joseph Singer is son of Israel Joshua Singer and nephew of Isaac Bashevis Singer In 1975, the first four books of Erev were translated into Hebrew by Zvi Aradand published under the title Beterem. In 1978, Schechtman suspended work on the novel Erev and began the writing of a large-scale autobiographical novel Ringen oyf der Neshome (The Rings on the Soul). The first and second books of the novel were published in 1981. The novel was translated into Hebrew and was printed twice: the first book was published in 1981, the second one ‚Äì in 1983, and both books together ‚Äì in the Classic series in 1992. The third and fourth books of the novel were published in 1988. Alma Shin is pen name of Eli Schechtman's daughter Larisa Berny- Schechtman translated the entire novel into Russian. The first and second books of the novel were published in 2001 under the title \\"Rings on the Soul\\" (in Russian –ö–æ–ª—å—Ü–∞ –Ω–∞ –¥—É—à–µ). The third and fourth books were printed in 2012 under the title \\"Plowing the Abyss\\" (in Russian –í—Å–ø–∞—Ö–∞—Ç—å –±–µ–∑–¥–Ω—É).This autobiographical novel was not noticed by the authors of the book \\"A Thousand Years of Ashkenazi Culture,\\" which commented about the \\"inability of the Yiddish culture as a whole ... to write a real autobiography, to reveal your \\"I\\" in historical time. [Mille ans de cultures ashkenazes], 1994, PH Liana Levi In 1983, Eli Schechtman finished and published his monumental novel Erev, consisting of seven books, which the author called \\"The Menorah of My Life.\\" The full novel was translated into Russian by Alma Shin and published in Israel in 2005. It was translated into French by and published in Paris in 2018. \\"Eli Chekhtman's novel could accompany the magnificent collection of the photographer Roman Vishniac with the title A Vanished World, which has preserved the memory of these Jewish communities in Eastern Europe, destroyed by the Shoah.\\" In 1988 Eli Schechtman began working on his last novel (The Last Sunset) which was published in 1994. The novel was translated into Russian by Alma Shin in 2008 and translated into French by Rachel Ertel in 2015. Gilles Rozier in his article \\"Le Yiddish d'une guerre √† l'autre\\" compares Eli Shekhtman with his contemporaries Vasily Grossman and Varlam Shalamov.Gilles Rozier https://next.liberation.fr/livres/2015/03/18/le- yiddish-d-une-guerre-a-l-autre_1223415 Before his death Eli Schechtman completed several short stories (published posthumously) as a collection, entitled Tristia. Several stories from Tristia were translated into Russian by Alma Shin and were published in 2000 under the name Sonatas.

The quantum mechanical theory was developed by John Hasbrouck Van Vleck between the 1920s and the 1930s to explain the magnetic response of gaseous nitric oxide (NO) and of rare-earth salts. Alongside other magnetic effects like Paul Langevin's formulas for paramagnetism (Curie's law) and diamagnetism, Van Vleck discovered an additional paramagnetic contribution of the same order as Langevin's diamagnetism. Van Vleck contribution is usually important for systems with one electron short of being half filled and this contribution vanishes for elements with closed shells.  Description  The magnetization of a material under an external small magnetic field \\\\mathbf{H} is approximately described by :\\\\mathbf{M}=\\\\chi\\\\mathbf{H} where \\\\chi is the magnetic susceptibility. When a magnetic field is applied to a paramagnetic material, its magnetization is parallel to the magnetic field and \\\\chi>0. For a diamagnetic material, the magnetization opposes the field, and \\\\chi<0. Experimental measurements show that most non-magnetic materials have a susceptibility that behaves in the following way: :\\\\chi(T)\\\\approx \\\\frac{C_0}{T}+\\\\chi_0, where T is the absolute temperature; C_0,\\\\chi_0 are constant, and C_0\\\\ge0, while \\\\chi_0 can be positive, negative or null. Van Vleck paramagnetism often refers to systems where C_0\\\\approx 0 and \\\\chi_0>0..  Derivation  The Hamiltonian for an electron in a static homogeneous magnetic field \\\\mathbf{H} in an atom is usually composed of three terms :\\\\mathcal{H}=\\\\mathcal{H}_0+\\\\mu_0\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{\\\\rm B}}{\\\\hbar}(\\\\mathbf{L}+g\\\\mathbf{S})\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{H}+\\\\mu_0^2\\\\frac{e^2}{8m_{\\\\rm e}}r^2_{\\\\perp} H^2 where \\\\mu_0 is the vacuum permeability,\\\\mu_{\\\\rm B}is the Bohr magneton, g is the g-factor, e is the elementary charge, m_{\\\\rm e} is the electron mass, \\\\mathbf{L} is the angular momentum operator, \\\\mathbf{S} is the spin, and r_\\\\perp is the component of the position operator orthogonal to the magnetic field. The Hamiltonian has three terms, the first one \\\\mathcal{H}_0 is the unperturbed Hamiltonian without the magnetic field, the second one is proportional to H, and the third one is proportional to H^2. In order to obtain the ground state of the system, one can treat \\\\mathcal{H}_0 exactly, and treat the magnetic field dependent terms using perturbation theory. Note that for strong magnetic fields, Paschen-back effect dominates. = First order perturbation theory = First order perturbation theory on the second term of the Hamiltonian (proportional to H) for electrons bound to an atom, gives a correction a positive correction to energy given by :\\\\Delta E^{(1)}=\\\\mu_0\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{\\\\rm B}}{\\\\hbar}\\\\langle \\\\mathrm g(\\\\mathbf L+g\\\\mathbf S)\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf Hg\\\\rangle where g\\\\rangle is the ground state. This correction leads to what is known as Langevin paramagnetism (the quantum theory is sometimes called Brillouin paramagnetism), that leads to a positive magnetic susceptibility. For sufficiently large temperatures , this contribution is described by Curie's law: :\\\\chi_{\\\\rm Curie}\\\\approx \\\\frac{C_1}{T}, a susceptibility that is inversely proportional to the temperature T, where C_0\\\\approx C_1 is the material dependent Curie constant. Due to Wigner‚ÄìEckart theorem, \\\\langle g\\\\mathbf{L}+g\\\\mathbf{S}g\\\\rangle\\\\propto\\\\langle g\\\\mathbf{J}g\\\\rangle, where \\\\mathbf{J}=\\\\mathbf{L}+\\\\mathbf{S}, is the total angular momentum. If the ground state has no total angular momentum there is no Curie contribution and other terms dominate. The first perturbation theory on the third term of the Hamiltonian (proportional to H^2), leads to a negative response (magnetization that opposes the magnetic field). Usually known as Larmor or Langenvin diamagnetism: :\\\\chi_{\\\\rm Larmor}=-C_2\\\\langle r^2\\\\rangle where C_2 is another constant proportional to n the number of atoms per unit volume, and \\\\langle r^2 \\\\rangle is the mean squared radius of the atom. Note that Larmor susceptibility does not depend on the temperature. = Second order: Van Vleck susceptibility = While Curie and Larmor susceptibilities were well understood from experimental measurements, J.H. Van Vleck noticed that the calculation above was incomplete. If H is taken as the perturbation parameter, the calculation must include all orders of perturbation up to the same power of H. As Larmor diamagnetism comes from first order perturbation of the H^2, one must calculate second order perturbation of the B term: :\\\\Delta E^{\\\\rm (2)}=\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mu_0 \\\\mu_{\\\\rm B}}{\\\\hbar}\\\\right)^2\\\\sum_i\\\\frac{\\\\langle \\\\mathrm{g}(\\\\mathbf{L}+g\\\\mathbf{S})\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf H\\\\mathrm{e}_i\\\\rangle^2}{E^{(0)}_\\\\mathrm{g}-E^{(0)}_{\\\\mathrm{e},i}} where the sum goes over all excited degenerate states \\\\mathrm{e}_i\\\\rangle, and E^{(0)}_{\\\\mathrm{e},i},E^{(0)}_\\\\mathrm{g} are the energies of the excited states and the ground state, respectively, the sum excludes the state i=0, where \\\\mathrm{e}_{0}\\\\rangle=\\\\mathrm{g}\\\\rangle . J.H. Van Vleck called this term the \\"high frequency matrix elements\\". In this way, Van Vleck susceptibility comes from the second order energy correction, and can be written as :\\\\chi_{\\\\rm VV}=2n\\\\mu_0\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{\\\\rm B}}{\\\\hbar}\\\\right)^2\\\\sum_{i(i eq 0)}\\\\frac{\\\\langle \\\\mathrm{g}L_z+gS_z\\\\mathrm{e}_i\\\\rangle^2}{E_{\\\\mathrm{e},i}-E_{\\\\rm g}}, and L_z and S_z are the projections of the orbital and spin angular momentum in the direction of the magnetic field. In this way, \\\\chi_0\\\\approx\\\\chi_{\\\\rm VV}+\\\\chi_{\\\\rm Larmor}, as the signs of Larmor and Van Vleck susceptibilities are opposite, the sign of \\\\chi_0 depends on the specific properties of the material.  General formula and Van Vleck criteria  For a more general system (molecules, complex systems), the paramagnetic susceptibility for an ensemble of independent magnetic moments can be written as :\\\\chi_{\\\\rm para}=\\\\mu_0\\\\mu_{\\\\rm B}^2\\\\frac{n}{\\\\sum_{i} p_i} \\\\sum_{i} p_i\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\left(W^{(1)}_i\\\\right)^2}{k T} - 2 W^{(2)}_i\\\\right]\\\\;;\\\\;p_i=\\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{E_i^{(0)}}{k T}\\\\right) where :W_i^{(1)}=\\\\langle iL_z+gS_z i\\\\rangle/\\\\hbar and :W_i^{\\\\rm (2)}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\hbar^2}\\\\sum_{k(k eq i)}\\\\frac{\\\\langle \\\\mathrm{e}_i(L_z+gS_z)\\\\mathrm{e}_k\\\\rangle^2}{\\\\delta E_{i,k}}\\\\;;\\\\;\\\\delta E_{i,k}=E^{(0)}_{\\\\mathrm{e}_i}-E^{(0)}_{\\\\mathrm{e},k}. Van Vleck summarizes the results of this formula in four cases, depending on the temperature: 1. If all \\\\delta E_{i,k}\\\\ll k_{\\\\rm B}T, where k_{\\\\rm B} is Boltzmann constant, the susceptibility follows Curie law: \\\\chi_{\\\\rm para}\\\\propto1/T, 2. If all \\\\delta E_{i,k}\\\\gg k_{\\\\rm B}T, the susceptibility is independent of the temperature 3. If all \\\\delta E_{i,k} is either \\\\gg k_{\\\\rm B}T or \\\\ll k_{\\\\rm B}T, the susceptibility has a mixed behavior and \\\\chi_{\\\\rm para}\\\\propto1/T+c, where c is a constant 4. If all \\\\delta E_{i,k}\\\\approx k_{\\\\rm B}T, there is no simple dependence on T. While molecular oxygen O_2 and nitric oxide NO are similar paramagnetic gases, O_2 follows Curie law as in case (a), while NO, deviates slightly from it. In 1927, Van Vleck considered NO to be in case (d) and obtained a more precise prediction of its susceptibility using the formula above. Systems of interest The standard example of Van Vleck paramagnetism is Eu_2O_3 salts where there are six 4f electrons in trivalent europium ions. The ground state of Eu^{3+} that has a total azimuthal quantum number j=0 and Curie's contribution (C_0/T) vanishes, the first excited state with j=1 is very close to the ground state at 330 K and contributes through second order corrections as showed by Van Vleck. A similar effect is observed in samarium salts (Sm^{3+} ions). In the actinides, Van Vleck paramagnetism is also important in Bk^{5+} and Cm^{4+} have a localized 5f6 configuration.

While abroad, he joined the royal court at the Vienna as a page, and became a royal secretary of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor. During that time he visited a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, and learned languages including French, Spanish, German, and Italian. By the 1560s he returned to Poland, where he served as a secretary to the bishop of Pozna≈Ñ, . Later he became the canon of Krak√≥w. He served as a Polish diplomat in several diplomatic mission (to Muscovy and Scandinavia during the reign of Stefan Batory), accompanying Batory during the Siege of Pskov and acting as one of the principal Polish negotiators for the subsequent Truce of Yam- Zapolsky of 1582. In his political activities during the period of royal elections, Warszewicki supported the monarchs, in particular, Henry of Valoise, and later, House of Hapsburg candidates for the Polish throne. That last decision ended up badly for him; when the Hapsburgs lost the elections, he suffered from royal disfavor and exile which may or may not have been voluntary (sources vary).  Works, views and assessment  Warszewicki was a vocal critic of the system of royal free elections and Golden Freedoms in the Polish Kingdom. He supported strengthening the royal power of that of the nobility. He has been described as one of the most famous writers of the Polish counter-reformation camp. He also supported the idea of a Crusade against the Ottoman Empire. Warszewicki published a number of works, including a work of poetry, and his only work in Polish, Wenecya (1572), a guidebook to Venice; his other works were in Latin. He published his thoughts on diplomacy in De Legatoet Lagatione (1595). His later major work, De optimo statu libertatis (1598), focused on political issues; one of its main themes was the concept of liberty. Those two works have been described as \\"his two major contributions to Renaissance political literature\\". Other works of his include Turcicae Quatuordecim (1598) and De Cognitione (1600). Warszewicki also authored five works focused on theological issues: Dialogus de morte (1581), Clypeus spiritualis (1582), De factis et dictis Jesu Christi (1583), Pro Christi fide et Petri sede (1583), and De morte et immortalitate animae (1599). While most of his works were printed and reprinted in Poland and the Holy Roman Empire, some of his works saw reprints as far as Venice, Spain, France, Sweden, and Rome. Both in Poland and abroad, Warszewicki was a respected orator. He spoke at the coronation ceremony of Henry of Valoise in 1574, and, in 1576, gave a funerary oration at the funeral of the Emperor Maximilian II. His funerary oration for the king Stefan Batory (d.1586), Vita, Res Gestae et Obitus Stephani Regis Poloniae, has been described as \\"very popular\\". Another royal funeral at which he spoke was that of Catherine of Austria, Queen of Poland (d. 1572). His speech from the Yam-Zapolsky negotiations, Christophori Warszewicii ad Stephanum re gem Poloniae oratio, qua cum Joanne Magno Moscorum duce XV Januarii ad Zapolskiam confectam pacem gratulatur, was quickly reprinted in Poland and Germany. Polish historian described Warszewicki as a controversial figure among modern historians, some of whom consider him an influential writer, while others see him as more derivative.

His breakthrough came in 1997 with Weiberroman (Novel of Women) and in 2008 with his cruise ship satire In 180 Tagen um die Welt (Around the World in 180 Days). His lifetime passion to travel to foreign countries also influences his perception of his own culture, and provides a source of new ideas for his writing. Politycki's London for Heroes. The Ale Trail ‚Äì an ale tale emerged from his excursions to London's East End pubs while he was Writer in Residence at Queen Mary University of London in 2009. His books have been translated into French, Italian, Japanese and Chinese. His Next World Novella (Jenseitsnovelle) was translated by Anthea Bell, OBE and published by Peirene Press in 2011. Politycki has completed numerous book tours, including at the Edinburgh World Writers' Conference in August 2012 and the Belfast Festival at Queen's in October 2014. His collected poems were published by Hoffmann und Campe in 2018.Bio 4 He has won numerous awards including the Ernst-Hoferichter-Preis in 2009. Life Matthias Politycki grew up in Munich and began writing aged sixteen when he was disappointed in love. He achieved his school-leaving certifiate (Abitur) in 1974 at the Maria-Theresia-Gymnasium. His military service was with 541 Infantry Battalion in Neuburg an der Donau in 1974/75. He completed a training exercise as a military reserve in 1977, but from then on he refused further active duty. He was officially recognized as a conscientious objector on 21 December 1977. From 1975 to 1987, he studied German literature, philosophy, theatre- and communication studies at the Universities of Munich and Vienna and graduated in 1981 with a Magister degree. In 1987, he completed his PhD with Walter M√ºller-Seidel in Munich. His dissertation on Nietzsche as a subtle interpreter of the influence of tradition and contemporary value-ideals was entitled Umwertung aller Werte? Deutsche Literatur im Urteil Nietzsches. Politycki taught for three semesters as a tenured assistant professor at the Munich Insitut f√ºr Deutsche Philologie. His career as a freelance writer began in earnest in 1990, although he continued as a freelance editor for Munich Publishers C.H. Beck until 1999. He encouraged dialogue among writers, literary editors and critics as organizer of the annual \\"Untitled\\" conferences from 2000 to 2005 at Schloss Elmau in the Bavarian Alps. In 2011, he was curator of the Munich Literature Festival. Matthias Politycki is a member of the PEN Centre Germany and the Freie Akademie der K√ºnste Hamburg in Hamburg. He lives in Hamburg and Munich. Literary work =Novels and short stories= Matthias Politycki's first novel in 1987 Aus F√§lle / Zerlegung des Regenbogens. Ein Entwickelungsroman. (Drop Outs / Disassembling the Rainbow. An Entwickelungsroman) was experimental and echoed the writing style of Arno Schmidt and James Joyce. He was described as a \\"form-fixated avant-gardist\\". By the early 1990s, his sights were set on a \\"new readability\\" of German literature. He argued that \\"literature must be like rock music\\". After Weiberroman in 1997, Politycki acknowledged his identity as a writer from the \\"Generation of 1978\\" (Reinhard Mohr) that he distinguished from the 1968 Movement with its strong protest tradition. His book was described as a cult novel; it is regarded as a key text of Postmodern literature in Germany. After five months in the Caribbean, his constant quest to explore the experience of a clash between familiar and foreign cultures emerged in his 2005 Cuba novel, Herr der H√∂rner (Lord of the Horns). This was the tale of an enlightened European's fight for survival in a culture influenced by archaic rituals. The story was a \\"search for the exotic\\" as much as about the will to resist the belief-system of Palo (religion) and Santer√≠a religions, and a \\"culmination of Nietzsche's admired 'Dionysian worldview'\\". In 2006, Hapag-Lloyd invited Politycki to become a writer-in-(non)-residence on board its luxury passenger ship MS Europa. Ten years after his best-selling Weiberroman, Politycki matched its success with his 2008 picaresque novel In 180 Tagen um die Welt. This is the story of a \\"modern Simplicissimus\\" who describes \\"the rituals of the rich and the super-rich\\". His Next World Novella gives a poignant insight into the mind of his protagonist, an expert in Chinese studies Hinrich Schepp. Schepp's story begins with the discovery that his wife, Doro, suffered a fatal stroke while editing his manuscript. Her constant fear of death ‚Äì the 'beyondness' of things (jenseits) ‚Äì compels him to reassess their life together. However, he realizes, too late, that her eloquent criticisms of his forgotten manuscript also bring to light her hidden perception of their married life. As critic Rebecca Morrison explains, Politycki \\"leavens his grim tale with playful teasing of his reader's expectations\\". In his 2013 novel Samarkand Samarkand, the carefully honed plot, which took about twenty-five years to create, shifts attention to the year 2026. The scene is set in legendary Samarkand, where Alexander Kaufner, a mountain ranger and frontier runner, embarks on a quest to find a mysterious cult place, a second Samarkand somewhere hidden high up in the mountains. The novel evolves a dark dystopia of the free West on the brink of collapse due to the aggression of Greater- Russia and the fundamentalist alliances of the Caliph of Baghdad. Kaufner's mission is to save the Western world from destruction. The critic Martin Halter commented that \\"Samarkand Samarkand is an immensely eloquent, oriental and vivid travelogue and adventure story that penetrates to the heart of darkness.\\" Among Politycki's literary role models ‚Äì Laurence Sterne, Diderot, Gottfried Benn and Vladimir Nabokov ‚Äì he recently acknowledged Ernest Hemingway as an important influence for the \\"simplicity and reduction\\" of his own writing style. =Essays= Politycki's new hybrid genre of non-fictional literature became evident in 2015 with his 42,195, an autobiographical book about marathon running. His Schrecklich sch√∂n und weit und wild (Fearsomely Beautiful and Far and Wild) in 2017 was described as a \\"mix of philosophical essay and autobiographical field report\\" about \\"the past, present and future of travel\\". Politycki's prolific newspaper articles are collected in two essay editions (1998 and 2007). He has voiced his view of the novel in German literature as an orientation map to the world in Relevanter Realismus, published as Was soll der Roman? (What Purpose for the Novel?) and, more focused on the growing controversy with other cultures, Wei√üer Mann ‚Äì was nun?(What Now ‚Äì White Man?). His standpoint on writing, which he compared to marathon running, was illustrated in a plenary lecture at the German Germanistentag in 2016. Programmatically entitled \\"Reduktion & Tempo\\", his talk was published in the G√∂ttinger Sudelbl√§tter (2017). =Poetry= Politycki presented all of his many poetry collections on stage. In 1996‚Äì1997, he went on tour with Robert Gernhardt and their common lyrical program Wein, Weib und Gesang (Wine, Women and Song); in 2004‚Äì2005 he joined Hellmuth Opitz and Steffen Jacobs with Frauen. Naja. Schwierig (Women. Well Now. Difficult). Publisher Uwe Wittstock described him as \\"the greatest living linguistic gourmet among German poets\\". Politycki's collected poetry edition S√§mtliche Gedichte 2017‚Äì1987 was awarded NDR Book of the Month in June 2018. It is a collection of previously published monographs, sporadically released poems as well as a new poem cycle and contains an afterword by Wolfgang Fr√ºhwald. Awards Matthias Politycki's first novel Aus F√§lle / Zerlegung des Regenbogens won the Civitas-Literaturpreis in 1987 and the Bayerischer Staatsf√∂rderpreis for literature in 1988. In 2009, he received the Ernst- Hoferichter-Preis of the city of Munich. He was awarded the Preis der LiteraTour Nord in 2010. In 2014, he became Writer in Residence in Osaka to celebrate the 25-year anniversary of the town-twinning of Hamburg and Osaka. That same year, he was Artist in Residence in St Moritz. He received the travel scholarship Literarischer Landgang of the Literaturb√ºro Oldenburg in 2015. As a recipient of a travel stipend of the Deutscher Literaturfonds and Sylt Foundation, in 2017 he travelled in Cambodia on the trail of the Khmer Rouge. In 2018, Schrecklich sch√∂n und weit und wild received the ITB BuchAward of the Internationale Tourismus B√∂rse (ITB) Berlin. His excursion to China in September 2018 was as Writer in Residence on the invitation of the Shanghai Writers' Association. He accepted a new invitation from the Chinese Writers' Association and the Lu Xun Academy as Writer in Residence in Beijing in 2019.

His historical existence is uncertain. Virtually our only source for his person is the Hervarar saga ok Hei√∞reks (13th century) that concludes with a brief chronicle of Swedish kings up to 1118. This text says that the renowned Viking ruler Ragnar Lodbrok, after his demise, was succeeded by his various sons who ruled over Sweden, Denmark, the eastern lands (Austrr√≠ki) and England.Christopher Tolkien & G. Turville-Petre (1956), p. 68. Bj√∂rn Ironside was assigned the Swedish realm. This information is historically problematic since Bj√∂rn is otherwise known to have performed Viking raids in West Francia in the 850s and allegedly died in Frisia in the early 860s.Storm (1877). According to the Hervarar saga Bj√∂rn had two sons called Erik and Refil. Erik inherited the Swedish kingship, though he only ruled for a short time. The younger son Refil was a \\"warrior king and sea king\\" (herkonungr ok s√¶konungr), in other words a princely raider on the lines of his father and grandfather. When the main ruler Erik died, Refil was apparently dead already, since the next ruler was Refil's son Erik Refilsson who is praised as a great warrior and all-mighty king.Christopher Tolkien & G. Turville-Petre (1956), p. 69. The late and compilatory nature of the Hervarar saga makes is difficult to assess the possible historicity of Refil or his son.Elleh√∏j (1965), p. 86-7 According to the Skaldatal a certain Alf Jarl the Small composed one or several praise poems for Erik Refilsson, though nothing of this has been preserved.Skaldatal The name R√¶fill is found in a list (√ûula) of legendary and mythical figures, that is included in Snorri's Edda, in a section with poetic names for sea kings. Many of these sea kings have names ending with -ill which speaks for them being poetic inventions.Nafnathulur, Strophe 4 References Literature * Elleh√∏j, Svend (1965) Studier over den √¶ldste norr√∏ne historieskrivning.

The Asklepieion of Athens was the sanctuary built in honour of the gods Asclepius and Hygieia, located west of the Theatre of Dionysos and east of the Pelargikon wall on the southern escarpment of the Acropolis hill.Travlos p. 127 It was one of several asklepieia in the ancient Greek world that served as rudimentary hospitals. It was founded in the year 419/18 BCE during the Peloponnesian War, perhaps as a direct result of the plague,Camp p.122 by Telemachos Acharneas.However, there remains the question of whether the cult of Asklepios was a private or public one. Bronwen L. Wickkiser in, Asklepios, Medicine, and the Politics of Healing in Fifth-Century Greece: Between Craft and Cult, 2003, argues that the state must have had a role in the importation of the cult His foundation is inscribed in the Telemachos Monument,IG II2 4960 and 4691, NAM 2490+ a double- sided, marble column which is topped by reliefs depicting the arrival of the god in Athens from Epidaurus and his reception by Telemachos. The sanctuary complex consisted of the temple and the altar of the god as well as two galleries, the Doric Arcade which served as a katagogion for overnight patients in the Asklepieion and their miraculous (through dreams) healing by the god, and the Ionic Stoa that served as a dining hall and lodging for the priests of Asclepius and their visitors.Travlos p.127 The Doric Arcade was founded according to inscriptions in 300/299 BCEAleshire, 1989 p.29, IG I3 1685 and was a two-storey building with 17 Doric columns on its facade. This is framed by the sacred spring at its eastern end and a pit lined with masonry at its western end. This source is a small cave in the rock, in which there lies the natural spring. The circular well or pit, a deep hollow with polygonal masonry built into the cliff face, was accessed from the second floor of the Doric Arcade and dates to the last quarter of the 5th century. F RobertF. Robert, Thym√©l√©, Biblioth√®ques de l'Ecole fran√ßaise d'Ath√®nes et de Rome - S√©rie Ath√®nes, 147, 1939 proposed that it was a place devoted to the celebration of Heroes in the Asklepeion during ta Heroa,IG II2 974-975, see Travlos p.127 which witnessed sacrifices to the chthonic gods and heroes, as testified epigraphically. The Ionian Arcade, west of the temple, is also dated to the last quarter of the 5th century.Travlos p.127 The sanctuary on its west side was enclosed by a propylon for the visitors to access from the ancient promenade to the Asklepieion site. According to epigraphic evidence, the propylon was renovated in Roman times.Diokles in 52/1 BCE, IG II2 1046 At the beginning of the 6th c. CE, when Christian worship succeeded the ancient, all the monuments of Asclepius were demolished and the material incorporated into the complex of a large, three-aisled Early Christian basilica.Travlos, p.127 In the Byzantine years (11th and 13th centuries) two smaller, single-aisled temples occupied the position of the basilica, while the latter of them functioned as the catholicon of a small monastery. Since 2002, partial restorations of the west end of the ground floor of the Doric Stoa fa√ßade, the room of the Sacred Cave on the first floor of the Doric Stoa and the temple of Asclepius have been performed.(eds) Constantine Boletis, Klimis Aslanidis, George Aslanis, Restoration works, 2002-2005, Committee for the Theatre and Shrine of Dionysos, Asklepieion on the Acropolis South Slope, 2006.

The film features Lakshmi Rai along with newcomers Vasanth, Vijayraj, Prakash, Kandan, and Sriram in lead roles, with Jayasurya, Charan Raj, Mahanadhi Shankar, Sethu Vinayagam, Hemalatha, Gowthami Vembunathan, M. S. Bhaskar, Pandu, Crane Manohar, and Bava Lakshmanan] playing supporting roles. The film had musical score by John Peter, cinematography by K. G. Sankar, and editing by R. T. Annadurai. The film was released on 22 August 2008 after many delays. Plot After graduating from college, Vasanth (Vasanth), Vijay (Vijayraj), Arun (Prakash) and Karthik (Kandan) have decided to stay in their rented house in Chennai while their friend Sakthi (Sriram) returns to his native village. Vasanth's girlfriend Jennifer (Lakshmi Rai) then comes to live with them. Later, Sakthi returns to the city and begins to behave strangely. Meanwhile, the rowdy Jayasurya (Jayasurya) is sought by the police. Jennifer, who bumps into Jayasurya at the local market, informs the police and the police inspector (Charan Raj), who arrests him. The six jobless friends are desperate to find a decent job and decide to steal from a minister (Sethu Vinayagam) who had black money. Posing as income tax officers, they conduct a surprise raid at the minister's house during his absence and secretly rob 30 crores of rupees. The minister then finds out the identities of the robbers. Meanwhile, Jayasurya escapes from jail with the help of the corrupt sub-inspector Shankar (Mahanadi Shankar), and the minister gives Jayasurya the mission of killing the six people. The friends are now hiding in a forest near Talakonam waterfalls. Jayasurya, who eventually finds their place, attacks Jayasurya when he was swimming alone in the falls. Later that night, the five friends find Sakthi's wounded body. Upset by the demise of their friend, they bury him with his share of the stolen money. Thereafter, Karthik, Arun, and Vijay are mysteriously murdered one by one. The killer turns out to be Sakthi. In the past, Sakthi and his sister (Hemalatha) were ill-treated by their greedy stepmother (Gowthami Vembunathan). His sister had to prostitute herself to pay his college fees. When he returned to his native village, Sakthi found his sister having sex with another man and was shocked. Sakthi later killed the man and slowly turned into a psychopath who could do anything for money. In the forest, Sakthi faked his own death with the help of Jayasurya. He then killed Jayasurya and started killing his friends one by one. Sakthi finally murders Jennifer and then reveals everything to the lone survivor Vasanth. In the meantime, Shankar comes to the forest with Sakthi's sister in order to steal their money. During the fight, Sakthi manages to kill Shankar, and his sister tries to convince him to stop his killing rampage. Sakthi, who is in a psychotic state, does not listen to her and tries to kill Vasanth. Sakthi's sister has no other choice but to kill Sakthi.

He was particularly associated with the career of Charles Bradlaugh and the National Secular Society. Forder was born in Yarmouth, Norfolk and was of humble, rural origins. He received little in the way of formal education. At the age of 16 he moved to Deptford and, having failed to be accepted by the army because he was too puny, obtained employment in Deptford with a marine engineer's. He then moved to Woolwich and obtained work at the Arsenal. It was in Woolwich that he first began to move in radical circles and became a familiar speaker at open air venues throughout London - Kennington, Smithfield, Mile End Waste etc. In 1862 he encountered Charles Bradlaugh at a meeting in Hyde Park and in 1865 went on to join The Reform League. By 1875 he had joined the National Secular Society (NSS) Council and in 1877 became the first paid secretary of the organisation after the brief temporary tenure of George Standring. This followed Bradlaugh and Annie Besant falling out with Charles Watts (the original NSS secretary) over Bradlaugh and Besant's republication of the pioneering birth control pamphlet Charles Knowlton's 'Fruits of Philosophy' As secretary of the NSS Forder was closely involved with Bradlaugh's successful campaigns to publish birth control literature at a price all could afford and from 1880-1886 to enter the House of Commons as an MP for Northampton when initially barred due to his atheism. After Bradlaugh's resignation as President of the NSS and his death in 1891, Forder took over the freethinkers' publishing and bookselling business which Bradlaugh and Besant had established at 28 Stonecutter Street, close to Fleet Street. From this address, and until his death, Forder continued to publish and sell literature from what will have been London's leading radical bookshop and publishing house of its era. In particular, he became the leading supplier of birth control literature, referred to then as 'Malthusian literature'. This included Henry Allbutt's \\"Wife's Handbook\\" which went on to sell over 500,000 copies.

The method quantifies surface potential variations via their influence on the potential of a quantum dot (QD) attached to the apex of the scanned probe. SQDM allows, for example, the quantification of surface dipoles originating from individual adatoms, molecules, or nanostructures. This gives insights into surface and interface mechanisms such as reconstruction or relaxation, mechanical distortion, charge transfer and chemical interaction. Measuring electric potential distributions is also relevant for characterizing organic and inorganic semiconductor devices which feature electric dipole layers at the relevant interfaces. The probe to surface distance in SQDM ranges from 2 nm to 10 nm and therefore allows imaging on non-planar surfaces or, e.g., of biomolecules with a distinct 3D structure. Related imaging techniques are Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) and Electrostatic Force Microscopy (EFM).  Working principle  In SQDM, the relation between the potential at the QD and the surface potential (the quantity of interest) is described by a boundary value problem of electrostatics. The boundary \\\\mathcal{S} is given by the surfaces of sample and probe assumed to be connected at infinity. Then, the potential \\\\Phi_\\\\text{QD} = \\\\Phi(\\\\bold{r}) of a point-like QD at \\\\bold{r} can be expressed using the Green's function formalism as a sum over volume and surface integrals, where \\\\mathcal{V} denotes the volume enclosed by \\\\mathcal{S} and \\\\bold{n}' is the surface normal. \\\\Phi_\\\\text{QD} = \\\\Phi(\\\\bold{r})=\\\\iiint\\\\limits_\\\\mathcal{V} G(\\\\bold{r}, \\\\bold{r}') \\\\frac{\\\\rho(\\\\bold{r}')}{e}d^3\\\\bold{r}'+ \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon_0}{e}\\\\oint\\\\limits_\\\\mathcal{S} \\\\bigg[G(\\\\bold{r}, \\\\bold{r}')\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi(\\\\bold{r}')}{\\\\partial \\\\bold{n}'}-\\\\Phi(\\\\bold{r}')\\\\frac{\\\\partial G(\\\\bold{r}, \\\\bold{r}') }{\\\\partial \\\\bold{n}'}\\\\bigg]d^2\\\\bold{r}'. In this expression, \\\\Phi_\\\\text{QD} depends on the charge density \\\\rho inside \\\\mathcal{V} and on the potential \\\\Phi on \\\\mathcal{S} weighted by the Green's function The relation between the QD potential at r and the surface potential at r' is described by a boundary value problem of electrostatics. G(\\\\bold{r},\\\\bold{r}')=\\\\frac{e}{4\\\\pi\\\\epsilon_0\\\\bold{r}-\\\\bold{r}'} + F(\\\\bold{r},\\\\bold{r}'), where F satisfies the Laplace equation. By specifying F and thus defining the boundary conditions, these equations can be used to obtain the relation between \\\\Phi_\\\\text{QD} and the surface potential \\\\Phi_\\\\text{s}(\\\\bold\\\\text{r}'), \\\\quad \\\\bold{r}' \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S} for more specific measurement situations. The combination of a conductive probe and a conductive surface, a situation characterized by Dirichlet boundary conditions, has been described in detail. Conceptually, the relation between \\\\Phi_\\\\text{QD}(\\\\bold{r}) and \\\\Phi_\\\\text{s}(\\\\bold{r}') links data in the imaging plane, obtained by reading out the QD potential, to data in the object surface - the surface potential. If the sample surface is approximated as locally flat and the relation between \\\\Phi_\\\\text{QD}(\\\\bold{r}) and \\\\Phi_\\\\text{s}(\\\\bold{r}') therefore translationally invariant, the recovery of the object surface information from the imaging plane information is a deconvolution with a point spread function defined by the boundary value problem. In the specific case of a conductive boundary, the mutual screening of surface potentials by tip and surface lead to an exponential drop-off of the point spread function. This causes the exceptionally high lateral resolution of SQDM at large tip-surface separations compared to, for example, KPFM.  Practical implementation  Two methods have been reported to obtain the imaging plane information, i.e., the variations in the QD potential \\\\Phi_\\\\text{QD}(\\\\bold{r}) as the probe is scanned over the surface. In the compensation technique, \\\\Phi_\\\\text{QD} is held at a constant value \\\\Phi_\\\\text{QD}^0. The influence of the laterally varying surface potentials on \\\\Phi_\\\\text{QD} is actively compensated by continuously adjusting the global sample potential via an external bias voltage V_\\\\text{b} . \\\\Phi_\\\\text{QD}^0 is chosen such that it matches a discrete transition of the QD charge state and the corresponding change in probe-sample force is used in non-contact atomic force microscopy to verify a correct compensation. In an alternative method, the vertical component of the electric field at the QD position is mapped by measuring the energy shift of a specific optical transition of the QD which occurs due to the Stark effect. This method requires an additional optical setup in addition to the SPM setup. The object plane image \\\\Phi_\\\\text{s}(\\\\bold{r}') can be interpreted as a variation of the work function, the surface potential, or the surface dipole density. The equivalence of these quantities is given by the Helmholtz equation. Within the surface dipole density interpretation, surface dipoles of individual nanostructures can be obtained by integration over a sufficiently large surface area.  Topographic information from SQDM  In the compensation technique, the influence of the global sample potential V_\\\\text{b} on \\\\Phi_\\\\text{QD} depends on the shape of the sample surface in a way that is defined by the corresponding boundary value problem. On a non-planar surface, changes in \\\\Phi_\\\\text{QD} can therefore not uniquely be assigned to either a change in surface potential or in surface topography t_\\\\text{d} if only a single charge state transition is tracked. For example a protrusion in the surface affects the QD potential since the gating by V_\\\\text{b} works more efficiently if the QD is placed above the protrusion. If two transitions are used in the compensation technique the contributions of surface topography t_\\\\text{d} and potential \\\\Phi_\\\\text{s} can be disentangled and both quantities can be obtained unambiguously. The topographic information obtained via the compensation technique is an effective dielectric topography of metallic nature which is defined by the geometric topography and the dielectric properties of the sample surface or of a nanostructure.

Plot The Tunkleys move from a caravan park into a suburban home goes wrong. Reception Andrew Urban wrote that \\"Emoh Ruo relies on stereotypes, but it does so with larrikin good humour, and lets us enjoy a big, lowbrow finish.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald stated \\"Emoh Ruo is a pleasant entertainment, but less than memorable\\". Writing in Cinema Papers Christine Cremen says \\"With its lively combination of satire, sentimentality, near-tragedy and pratfall farce, Emoh Ruo resembles one of the better Preston Sturges comedies\\". Writing in the book Australian Film, 1978-1994: A Survey of Theatrical Features Bruce Sandow states \\"More light-hearted situation comedy than biting satire, the film has its amusing moments. Competently made and entertaining in a lowbrow way, it has no pretensions to social comment. But its resorting to well-known Australian stereotypes is more often witless than inspired.\\" A review in Variety finishes \\"Overall, Emoh Ruo might just be the success the Australian film industry is looking for right now\\".

Cytocentrifuges are used in various areas of the clinical laboratory, such as cytopathology, hematology and microbiology, as well as in biological research. The method can be used on many different types of specimens, including fine needle aspirates, cerebrospinal fluid, serous and synovial fluid, and urine. Procedure To prepare cytocentrifuge smears, a funnel assembly is attached to the front of a microscope slide. The surface of the funnel assembly that is in contact with the slide is lined with filter paper to absorb excess fluid. A few drops of fluid are placed in the funnel. The assembly is placed in the cytocentrifuge, which operates at a low force (600‚Äì800 x g) to preserve cellular structure. Centrifugal force pushes the fluid through the funnel's opening and concentrates the cells in a small area of the slide. The centrifugation process concentrates cells by about twenty-fold and creates a one-cell-thick monolayer, allowing for assessment of cellular morphology. The slide can then be fixed and stained. Applications Lymphoma cells in cerebrospinal fluid Some applications of cytocentrifuges include: * Performing differential cell counts on body fluids, such as serous, synovial and cerebrospinal fluid * Cytopathology examination of liquid specimens such as body fluids and fine needle aspirates * Gram staining of fluid specimens for identification of microorganisms Limitations The cytocentrifugation process can cause cells to appear distorted. Cells located at the centre of the smear may look compressed compared to cells at the periphery. Cell nuclei may develop artifactual clefts, lobes, or holes, and the cytoplasm may appear vacuolated or develop irregular projections. Cytoplasmic granules may be pushed to the periphery of the cell. If the cell count is high, cells may be distorted due to crowding; therefore, samples with high cell counts are diluted prior to smear preparation. History Examination of cells in body fluids was historically performed using a hemocytometer, a chamber designed for counting cells microscopically. This technique was limited by poor discrimination between cell types (cells could only be classified as mononuclear or polymorphonuclear) and the low number of cells present in unconcentrated body fluids. Moreover, this technique did not produce a permanent record of the specimen. In a 1966 paper, Watson P. described the first cytocentrifuge, calling it \\"an apparatus for concentrating cells in suspension onto a microscope slide\\". The device was sold commercially in the 1970s and in 1983 it was patented by Shandon (now Thermo Scientific). As of 2012, numerous brands of cytocentrifuge exist on the market.

The castle was ruined by the end of the 15th-century, and sat at the bottom of Coinagehall Street, where the bowling green and Grylls Monument are now located. Although very little is known about the castle, it is speculated that the castle was a fortified manor house. Background Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall was the grandson of King John, and a wealthy magnate who served as regent for his cousin King Edward I. As Earl of Cornwall, he controlled eight and a third of Cornwall's nine hundreds, and had an income of around ¬£8,000 per year (the equivalent of roughly ¬£ in 2019). Helston is a town in south-west Cornwall, England. It was granted a town charter by King John in 1201, and gained further status during Edward I's reign, when it became a stannary town which returned two members of parliament. History and location The castle was built sometime in the late 13th century for Edmund. There is speculation regarding the function of the castle; Charles Henderson said that it was a fortified manor house. The location of the site, overlooking the river valley, which at the time was accessible from the sea, has also led to suggestions that it was more defensive in nature. By the time of William Worcester's visit in 1478, the castle was in ruins, while another fifty years later, John Leland recorded that there were only traces of the castle remaining. In David J Cathcart King's index of British castles, he records Helston Castle as a \\"vanished castle\\". The former site of the castle is now the location of a bowling green and the Grylls Monument, at the bottom of Coinagehall Street.

Gugger von Staudach (or Coelestin, * 28 June 1701 in Feldkirch as Michael Anton; ‚Ä† 24 February 1767 in Saint Gall) was from 23 March 1740 until his death prince abbot of the Abbey of Saint Gall. He is regarded as one of the most important abbots in the abbey's late period. He is attributed the solution of different long-lasting conflicts of the abbey, amongst others that with the Bishopric of Konstanz.The construction of the now world famous Saint Gall Cathedral was initiated and supervised by C√∂lestin, albeit he did not live to see its completion.  Career  C√∂lestin Gugger von Staudach was born in 1701 as son of city councillor Michael Anton Gugger von Staudach and Maria Oexlin. First he visited the Jesuit school in Feldkirch, but in 1719 he changed over to the monastery school in Saint Gall. On 16 October 1721, he took his religious vows as Benedictine, four years later he was already consecrated as priest. In 1726, C√∂lestin was moreover appointed professor of theology. On 18 October 1729, he travelled to Rome for study purposes and returned one year later with a doctoral degree. In the sequel, he held different offices in the monastery. Ultimately, he was elected abbot on 23 March 1740. He received the consecration on 19 September of the following year. Father Bernhard Frank von Frankenberg, who had been C√∂lestin's rival in the election of the abbot, later became the Abbot of Disentis Abbey. Several times, C√∂lestin had to support him with staff and money, as the financial situation at Disentis Abbey was for a long time desolate.  Works as prince abbot  When attempting to receive homage from his subject, it was denied him in Toggenburg. A number of unpleasant occurrences ensued. The Toggenburger demanded from the new abbot that he continue the negotiations about the crew right (dt. \\"Mannschaftsrecht\\") which had been granted them by his predecessor Joseph von Rudolfi. With the intervention of Bern and (although showing little interest) Zurich, the abbot managed to receive the Toggenburgers' homage in due form in 1743. The first negotiated solution regarding the rights of the subject territory, however, was only attained in 1755 - in consequence of pressure from France. The final solution would take four more years to be achieved. In several other parishes, Abbot C√∂lestin Gugger proved skill in solving conflicts on the path of negotiation, for instance when people in Rorschach were trying to rebel against the abbatial governance - on grounds of false accusations. Another conflict that C√∂lestin encountered was with the Bishopric of Konstanz. The Bishopric had for historical reasons - the Abbey of Saint Gall officially belonged to the Bishopric - the right to make visitations to the Saint Gall parishes. Saint Gall had for a longer time been able to shirk these visitations, but the formal eviction of one of the bishopric's judicial vicars from the country was the last straw that broke the camel's back and Konstanz complained. In the subsequent trial, first the court that was responsible for this conflict had to be defined. Saint Gall appealed to Rome, Konstanz to the Aulic Council in Mainz. Finally, the conflict was settled in Rome by means of the exchange of lands (to Konstanz) for rights (to Saint Gall). However, later on federal troops still had to restore order several times as Saint Gall and Konstanz did not want to adhere to the new rules and, for example, did not present a newly elected chaplain to the abbot, but, as before, to the bishop. From today's perspective, C√∂lestin's most important works were his representative edifices. In 1746, he began with the construction of the granary in Rorschach. On 29 April 1757, he laid the foundation of his most significant work, the new construction of the Abbey of Saint Gall. The building itself was constructed in two stages and finished in 1767; the completion of the interior, however, took much more time. The abbey received its final consecration only in 1867, long after the abolishment of the monastery. Simultaneously with the abbey, C√∂lestin also had a new library built. The baroque hall of the abbey library of Saint Gall is reckoned one of the world's most beautiful profane halls. Together, the abbey and the library cost 457'929 guilder. C√∂lestin was also an able businessman who knew how to skilfully utilise the abbey's sources of money. Despite the significant expenses of his construction work as well as trials and jura regalia, he was able to pay back the entire debt that he had inherited from his predecessor and furthermore bequeath his successor 180'600 guilder in cash and 57'695 guilder as capital.

He also recorded his assaults, which were found in a trash bin by a telephone technician, who reported the matter to authorities. He was arrested and sentenced to 114 years imprisonment for violent indecent assault and child grooming.  Biography  = Childhood and youth = Eug√™nio Chipkevitch was born in a Jewish family in 1954, in the Ukrainian SSR, then part of the Soviet Union. Together with his parents, the family fled the country due to the harsh regime, moving to Brazil. After he was naturalized, Chipkevitch became a respected medical and academic professional. He graduated from the University of S√£o Paulo's Faculty of Medicine in 1978, quickly becoming the head of the Adolescent Service at the \\"Children's Hospital Darcy Vargas\\" at S√£o Paulo. Chipkevitch was also a member of other associations, such as the \\"Society for Research on Adolescence from the United States. Chipkevitch was also ranked among the 2,000 most important scientists of the 20th century, as an entry in the respected publication Who's Who in Science and Engineering, for introducing the medical specialty hebiatrics in Brazil. = Paulista Adolescents Institute = While working in the clinic, he had a register of about 2,000 clients, who paid above average fees to be attended to by the reputed doctor. His books were also adopted in various universities.  Crimes  In 2002, a technician from a telephone company, who was helping a colleague repair a telephone line, was surprised to see a large square-shaped trash bag next to the pole in a rubbish dump. Curious, he peeked inside, and noticed that there were several video tapes in portable camcorder format. He decided to take them home, in order to find out which ones were good quality, while he would discard the others. A total of 35 ribbons were found in the trash bag. While watching the tapes, the technician was surprised to see a man abusing young people. In the following days, he passed the tapes to Rede Globo, the SBT and the Civil Police. In more than 15 hours of recordings, of which only a small portion were aired, scenes of sexual abuse were committed against about 40 victims ‚Äì all boys, aged between 8 and 17 years. The doctor sedated the patients under the pretext of vaccinating them, then stripped them and settled them on a stretcher. While unconscious, he caressed them, picked them up and fondled their genitals. On the night of March 20, 2002, pictures were aired on Programo do Ratinho, showing Chipkevitch molesting his patients. When the recordings aired, the doctor's identity was still unknown. But the mother of one of Chipkevitch's patients watched the show, realising who it was, and that same evening filed a complaint to the police. The day after, the doctor was arrested at home, and police quickly began work into identifying the victims. The case quickly gained widespread attention in the media. Computers were seized to find out if Chipkevitch advertised child pornography over the Internet. No such thing was found, although pictures of naked children were found in his car. Before his arrest, he was about to release another book, titled \\"Adolescence: The Secrets That Children Don't Tell\\", which would be released at the Book Festival in April. The book was suspended for publication when Chipkevitch's crimes were revealed, with his medical license permanently revoked. The lawsuit proceeded swiftly, and was finalized in 2004. The doctor was sentenced in the first instance to a total penalty of 128 years imprisonment, plus fines for indecent assault with presumed violence, since the victims were unable to defend themselves. The penalty was compounded by the fact that he used his position as a doctor to commit the crimes. Subsequently, the Court of Justice reduced the sentence to 114 years, keeping the closed regime. Chipkevitch is serving his sentence at a prison in Sorocaba, where it houses predominantly rapists and pedophiles.

Spontaneous elements of the Chuvash national movement (CNM) were manifested, starting from the 16th century, in various forms of social performances. Evasion of taxes and duties, local armed actions of local importance, submission of petitions to the authorities, withdrawal to regions weakly controlled by the state, participation in large- scale anti-government protests, persistent resistance to mass Christianization (see O.

Svechin, Uprising of Chuvash and Mari peasants in 1842) were evidence of the protest potential of the ethnos.Chuvash encyclopedia  The beginning of unity of the Chuvash people  G. I. Petrukhin, A. F. Fedorov, S. N. Maksudov, G. M. Musin; sit: Z. M. Talantsev, M. V. Baturov, M. Y. Kapustin, D. A. Kushnikov S. T. Maksyutov. The reforms of Alexander II and related socio-economic, political and spiritual transformations opened a new era in the history of the peoples of the Volga region. A significant factor in the national mobilization of the Chuvash ethnic group was the liberalization of social and political life associated with the expansion of citizens. rights and legal field, as well as educational space. N. I. Ilminsky, N. I. Zolotnitsky, I. Ya. Yakovlev, I. N. Ulyanov, Simbirsk Chuvash school played an important role in the development of school business and culture among the Chuvash population. Socio-economic shifts and changes in the 2nd half of the 19th century were reflected in the public consciousness and prepared the ideological basis for the emergence of an organized CNM, the formulation of its slogans, political interests and demands. At the turn of 19‚Äì20 centuries there was a consolidation of Chuvash ethnonation. Its basic features: the Chuvash language, which has grown to the level of a single literary language, professional culture, the emergence of national intelligentsia. Language and culture, the commonality of the Chuvash nation was supported by the compact residence of the bulk of the people in the common territory. By the end of the 19th century there was a final formation and stabilization of the configuration of the ethnic territory of the Chuvash (7 adjacent counties of Kazan and Simbirsk provinces), where 78% of the Chuvash lived. On the basis of ethnoconsolidation processes and the growth of consciousness among the Chuvash in the early 20th century clearly marked the beginnings of an organized CNM. In the 1st decade of the 20th century, the national movement of the Chuvash people moved from the 1st phase, characterized by the emergence of national educators, Patriotic figures of education and culture, who were engaged in the study of the language, history and culture of the people, to the 2nd phase-the national ‚Äì Patriotic agitation to spread self-consciousness to all The 3rd phase of the CNM ended with the formation of a mass movement with open political slogans and a network of national organizations formed for the purpose of ethnic emancipation, which occurred in 1917.  –°NM during the First Russian revolution  The peoples of the Volga region national movement was accelerated by the First Russian revolution of 1905‚Äì07, in which intertwined socio-political, economic and national contradictions and conflicts. The ideas of national rise were first of all carried by the young Chuvash intelligentsia, represented by teachers, priests and lawyers. Many of them were pupils of the Simbirsk Chuvash teacher's school, but could not be satisfied with the goals and objectives that I. Y.Yakovlev set at the time. The vast majority of representatives of the Chuvash intelligentsia shared the ideas of the SR party, which had the strongest influence on the Chuvash population of all revolutionary movements in the Volga region. Ideology and leaders of the CNM were formed in her environment. The Chuvash social revolutionaries demanded national and cultural autonomy. Publication of the newspaper \\"Khypar\\" (January 1906) contributed to the unity of the avant-garde forces of the nation, understanding the ways of social and cultural revival of the people. Newspaper \\"Khypar\\" stood at the origins of national journalism, which testified to a significant shift in Chuvash social thought, the range of which has expanded from educational to socio-political, state-legal views. The newspaper played a role in the state Duma elections. Parliamentarians from Chuvashia (Y.A. Abramov, N. P. Efremov, D. A. Kushnikov, K. V. Lavrsky, I. I. Sokolov, Z. M. Talantsev, A. F. Fedorov), regardless of party affiliation, spoke in their parliamentary activities for the development of education, in defense of national equality. During the revolution of 1905‚Äì07 the movement turned Chuvash peasants, in which the agrarian question was put forward socio-political and national demands ‚Äì civil rights and freedoms, equality of languages, schooling in their native language, the election of judges by the local population, the use of the Chuvash language in the proceedings, the formation of local management taking into account the national composition of the population, etc. In 1905‚Äì07, new forces in the face of youth and political radicals entered the arena of Chuvash social life, supplementing the concept of national unification on the basis of comprehensive education and culture with emphasis on the growth of political consciousness, the class struggle for the social liberation of the Chuvash people. Qualitative changes occurred in the Chuvash socio-political thought, which on the basis of enlightenment and liberal ideas had a General tendency to form a national ideology, did not go beyond the requirement of cultural and national autonomy. The idea of territorial autonomy was expressed only by some figures of Chuvash culture (I. N. Yurkin, G. A. Korenkov).  CNM after February revolution  Developed after the February revolution of 1917 H. n. d. initially went within the framework of multiethnic territorial bodies of the peoples of the Volga-Kama region, developed a common form of organization-society (then the Union of small nationalities of the Volga region) and congresses of small nationalities of the Volga region. The first national Chuvash associations began to emerge in the spring of 1917: on 27 March, the Ufa Chuvash national society was created under the chairmanship Of G. I. Komissarov, by the summer a network of Chuvash national organizations was formed, which included not only provincial, but also County and rural ones. The national upsurge was in its own way transformed in Church life. A number of clergymen became active figures of CNM (P. p. Shlenkin, D. F. Filimonov, T. A. Zemlyanitsky, G. T. Tikhonov, A. S. Ivanov, K. P. Prokopiev, etc.). As the main requirements they put forward: the appointment of Chuvash priests to Chuvash parishes, the introduction of the native language into Church worship, the establishment of the post of Chuvash Bishop. Revived 1 May 1917 newspaper \\"Khypar\\" became a mouthpiece of socio- political and national aspirations of the ethnic group, called for the unity of all Chuvash. A distinctive feature of the post-February period-the radical democratization of existing and the emergence of new political institutions, which in the national. they were inevitably filled with ethnic content. For the first time in history, Chuvash people were elected as chairmen of the Civil, Cheboksary and Yadrin Zemstvo councils. There were alternative forms of mass participation of the Chuvash population in social and political life- councils of deputies, peasant congresses and unions, soldiers. organizations, etc. The most clearly national specificity was manifested in the activities of the County peasant congresses, which raised and discussed the issues of national self-determination of peoples and the administrative and territorial structure of Russia. Nationally oriented were the associations of Chuvash servicemen (Chuvash military committees and fellow countrymen), in their midst a new generation of political leaders was emerging (A. D. Krasnov, D. P. Petrov, G. T. Titov, etc.). The diversity of forms of CH. n. d. after February 1917 reflected other public associations, for example, such as teachers ' unions, the Union of Chuvash students, etc. They did not set themselves a program of national and political goals, but formed a social space for the development of social and civic initiatives of Chuvash society. February 1917 sharply stimulated multipartyism, bringing to the fore the liberal and socialist parties, which in their programs inevitably had to articulate clearly the vision and ways of solving national problems. Political parties, with the exception of the black hundreds, operating in the Chuvash region, put forward a demand for autonomy within the Russian state, transformed into a democratic or Federal. The leaders of the socialist revolutionaries as the program goals of the party in the summer of 1917 put forward the slogans of the democratic Republic with the prospect of transformation into a Federal state with the onset of appropriate socio-political conditions, national- cultural autonomy for the Chuvash, proportional-national representation in elected authorities. The strategy of national rise and ideological platform of CH. n. d. were adopted at the all-Chuvash national forum in June 1917 in Simbirsk (see Congress of the all-Chuvash national), which elected the Central Chuvash organization-the Chuvash national society (CNS).  CNM after October revolution  The overthrow of the Provisional government and the transfer of power into the hands of a coalition of Bolsheviks and left SRS in October 1917 created a new configuration of political forces in the country. The Soviet government proclaimed in its decrees the de jure right of the peoples of Russia to free self-determination until the formation of an independent state. Largely under the influence of this circumstance, at the end of 1917, the national leaders of the Tatars and Bashkirs put forward a plan for regional autonomy of the Middle Volga region and the Urals (Volga-Ural state, Ural- Volga state, middle Volga and South Ural state, Volga-Kama state, Volga-Ural Soviet Republic or Tatar-Bashkir Soviet Republic). In the discussions about its creation the main requirements of the Chuvash representatives attended the equality and sovereignty of all its Nations and all national-cultural autonomy; the generated state was seen as an inseparable part of Russia, and internal administrative unit as \\"regiona (regional) Federal Republic of nationalities\\". The final position in the disputes about the Tatar-Bashkir Soviet Republic was expressed at the all-Chuvash workers 'and peasants' Congress (June 1918), which opposed the inclusion of the Chuvash population. At the end of February‚ÄìMarch 1918 there was a split in the CH. n. d., won the bloc of left forces, which included the left socialists-revolutionaries, the party of Chuvash socialists-nationalists and non-party soldiers, teachers and students who recognized the platform of Soviet power. Members of the left bloc seized the property of the editorial office of the newspaper \\"Khypar\\" from the right SRS and started publishing a new printing body \\"Kanash\\". On 5 March the Chuvash left socialist Committee was formed, on its initiative the Commissariat for Chuvash Affairs under the Kazan provincial Council was opened. The final disengagement among the leaders of the C. N. D. occurred in the summer of 1918, when a large group of national figures, active. CHNO members, Chuvash delegates of the Constituent Assembly (G. F. Alunov, S. N. Nikolaev, D. P. Petrov, G. T. Titov, I. V. Vasiliev) moved to the anti-Soviet camp. However, the movement continued its organizational formalization in the form of Soviet-party organizations. In 1918‚Äì19 in Kazan, Simbirsk, Samar. and Saratov provinces arose Chuvash sub-departments in the provincial departments of the Executive committees of the Soviets, created the corresponding section at the provincial committees of the RCP(b); the Chuvash sub-divisions (sections) also operated under the political departments of the red Army headquarters and revolutionary military councils. The Central Soviet institution was the Chuvash Department under the People's Commissariat for nationalities of the RSFSR headed by D. S. Elmen.  Chuvash AO ‚Äì Chuvash ASSR  Since the 2nd Polina of 1918, the leaders of the CNM began to lean towards the idea of national-territorial autonomy-the creation of the Chuvash administrative-territorial unit. The project of formation of the Chuvash labor commune is documented. The idea of organizing a separate national-territorial unit for the Chuvash people was embodied in the creation of the Chuvash Autonomous region with its subsequent transformation into the Chuvash ASSR. Since the 2nd Polina of 1918, the leaders of the CH. n. d. began to lean towards the idea of national-territorial autonomy-the creation of the Chuvash administrative-territorial unit. The project of formation of the Chuvash labor commune is documented. The idea of organizing a separate national-territorial unit for the Chuvash people was embodied in the creation of the Chuvash Autonomous region with its subsequent transformation into the Chuvash ASSR. There was a network of national educational institutions ‚Äì in Bashkiria, Tatarstan, Simbirsk, Samara and other provinces. Chuvash Newspapers were produced in Samara and Kazan. For Chuvash residents of all regions of the USSR in Moscow was published in the Chuvash language newspaper \\"Voice of workers\\". In Bashkiria, Simbirsk province, Tatar ASSR, Saratov province, Kazakhstan and Siberia were formed Chuvash national administrative-territorial units. In the 1920s there was a network of Chuvash representations at the Central party and Soviet bodies and institutions. The abandonment of the new economic policy, the formation of a totalitarian society were accompanied by the curtailment of democratic processes in the sphere of national relations: the prevailing trend here since the early 1930s has been towards unification. The national began to be interpreted as nationalistic and opposed to the international. The network of Chuvash representations in Moscow was liquidated, the publication of the Central newspaper in the Chuvash language \\"Kommunar\\"was suspended. Under the banner of the fight against \\"nationalism\\" was forgotten experience taking into account the interests of all ethno-territorial groups of Chuvashes, from official documents disappeared mention of the Chuvash, compactly living outside the Republic; curtailed the processes of indigenization and implementation of the Chuvash language policy. In the mid-1960s, the theory of erasing national differences, merging nationalities into one \\"Soviet people\\"was proclaimed.  Perestroyka /Restructuring  The situation in the sphere of national relations began to change radically in the years of perestroika. Since the end of 1980-ies again revived CNM. One of its organizational forms was the coordination center for support of creative youth (CSCY) at the Chuvash regional Committee of the Komsomol, the decision to establish which was taken in April 1987. The CSCY consisted of young writers, artists, actors, scientists, humanitarians, students. Kctm events caused sharp discussions about the prospects of the poetic word, the tradition of the artistic and poetic avant-garde of the early 20th century, the status of the native language and the future of national cultures, the right of the nation to free political, economic and cultural development. In the spring of 1988, a group of researchers of CHNII YALE and ChSU took the initiative to create the Society of I. ya. Yakovlev, the program and Charter of the society as a people's social and political movement were developed. Among the goals and objectives proclaimed moral and national revival of the society, the Association of national-cultural aspirations of all Chuvash people regardless of where they live, the sovereignty of the Chuvash Autonomous Republic in the sphere of economy, politics and culture, the preservation and development of national traditions, giving Chuvash state language, study and popularization of a heritage of I. Ya. Yakovlev and other. A discussion took place in the Republican mass media, on 30 November 1988 a broad meeting was held to discuss the program goals and objectives of The Yakovlev Society. The initiative met with opposition from the Chuvash. the regional Committee of the CPSU, and scheduled for April 1989 constituent Congress was banned.  ChSCC ‚Äì CNC  As an alternative, in December 1989, the founding Congress of the Chuvash social and cultural center (ChSCC) was held, the Chairman of which was elected M. N. Yukhma. In February‚ÄìMarch, the Council of Ministers of the Chuvash ASSR approved the Charter and platform of the CSCC. In March 1991, the founding Congress of the Chuvash national revival party (Chuvash atalanu party, CHAP) was held, the program of which was aimed at achieving economic and political sovereignty of Chuvashia. On 9 October 1992, the founding Congress of the Chuvash National Congress (CNC) was held, the leitmotif of which was the implementation of state sovereignty in full. Chairman of the PNP was elected A. P. Khoosanguy. Since the late 1980s, there have been national and cultural associations (NCA) of Chuvash in various regions of Russia, primarily in the Ural-Volga region (the republics of Bashkortostan and Tatarstan, Ulyanovsk and Samara regions), where the largest mass of the Chuvash population lives relatively compactly outside the territory of Chuvashia. Different forms of NCOs were created in Moscow and St. Petersburg, in the CIS countries (Kazakhstan, Moldova, Ukraine) and the Baltic States (Latvia, Estonia). After the adoption of the Law of the Russian Federation \\"on national-cultural autonomy\\" (1996), the Chuvash national-cultural autonomy (ChNCA) began to form. By 2011, there are 85 Chuvash NCOs in the Russian Federation, including 25 NCAs. In 2001, the Federal national-cultural autonomy of the Chuvash people of Russia was approved as an extraterritorial public-state entity. Most Chuvash NCOs and NCAs are engaged in cultural and educational activities-the creation of folklore groups, the traditional Chuvash holidays, the publication of local Republican and regional newspapers, books of local lore and historical and ethno-cultural content, take initiatives to support national school education (the study of the native language and literature), the organization of Chuvash radio and television programs at the local level.

Helberg Joseph Lux (January 1757 ‚Äì 9 May 1818) was a German actor and operatic bass), who appeared especially in comic roles.  Life  Born in Glatz, Lux was first engaged from 1783/84 in Johann Heinrich B√∂hm's travelling troupe. In 1786 he changed to Gustav Friedrich Wilhelm Gro√ümann, who at this time had joined the theatre entrepreneur Christian Wilhelm Klos and played in the cities of Cologne, D√ºsseldorf and Bonn. The music director of the company was Friedrich August Burgm√ºller. The important ensemble, which last performed in Aachen, gave rise to the Bonner Nationaltheater, which was subsidized by Elector Maximilian Franz with 15,000 Reichstalers per year and opened on 3 January 1789. Lux soon assumed a central position there. On 2 October 1789 he was also employed as a court musician. Temporarily, until February 1790, the Bonner Theater also included Heinrich Vohs. Through his activities Lux came into close contact with the young Ludwig van Beethoven and accompanied him and the other members of the court chapel on the memorable journey the court made to Mergentheim in September and October 1791.Vgl. Adolf Sandberger, Zur Reise nach Mergentheim und Aschaffenburg, in ders., Ausgew√§hlte Aufs√§tze zur Musikgeschichte, volume 2, Munich 1924, Beethovens Jugendfreund Franz Gerhard Wegeler berichtet: Beethoven probably composed for Lux the two comic arias for bass and orchestra Pr√ºfung des K√ºssens WoO 89 and Mit M√§deln sich vertragen WoO 90, written in 1790. On 7 July 1792 Lux made his debut in Frankfurt am Main, where he was heard by Goethe. He characterized him as a \\"crowded, well-educated middle figure\\" and an actor who \\"knows how to motivate his clothes and gestures after the roles\\". Soon Lux belonged also in Frankfurt to the most popular actors, as an article from Frankfurt reports: Lux remained attached to the Frankfurter stage until his death.

Written by Michael Waldron and directed by Jacob Hair, loosely adapting The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway, the episode aired in the United States on November 17, 2019.  Plot  An alien intern named Glootie serves breakfast to the Smiths, often asking for assistance in developing a mobile app, even though Rick has tattooed \\"Do Not Develop My App\\" on Glootie's forehead. As Rick excuses himself and leaves for a solo adventure, which Summer surmises as defecating, Jerry is curious and offers to develop Glootie's app. Glootie and Jerry's app goes online, infuriating Morty. The app, named \\"Lovefinderrz\\", turns out to be a dating app that entices its users to divert their full attention into finding their true love. Summer ditches Beth on their lunch for her date, leading to a fight between the two. Seeing the widespread chaos, Jerry realizes his wrongdoing and joins Morty in demanding Glootie to take the app down. Glootie leads them to his mothership, where they meet the aliens' leader, who rebukes humanity's inefficiency in mastering love and states that the app is a distraction to steal Earth's water resources. Beth chases after Summer, who constantly changes her soul mate with the app, while Jerry and Morty are captured. Jerry manages to convince Glootie to take the app offline, showing their similarity in being unable to find a match. As Morty chastises Jerry about his decisions, Glootie puts an ad-wall on the app, leading Summer and everyone else to delete the app and resume their lives. Rick travels to a scenic, private lavatory. Discovering that it has been intruded upon, he tracks down the poop bandit, who is named Tony. Despite admonishment from Rick, Tony continues to use the lavatory, leaving Rick to punish him by using a chemical called \\"Globafin\\" to put him in his ideal toilet-filled simulation of heaven before evicting him. As Rick gives him a final warning, Tony chides him about his control issues and advises friendship. Rick prepares a defense measure on the toilet designed to humiliate its future user. Upon visiting Tony's office, he finds out from his assistant that Tony has quit his job and died in a ski accident, having intended to live life to the fullest. Feeling guilty, Rick attends Tony's funeral, then goes back to the lavatory and sits on the toilet, which spawns a crowd of holographic Ricks who berate \\"Tony\\" and his loneliness. In the post-credits scene, Jerry consumes some Globafin and sees his own ideal reality: himself as a competent water-bottle delivery man.  Production and writing  \\"The Old Man and the Seat\\" was written by Michael Waldron and directed by Jacob Hair. The episode features guest actors Sam Neill as the Monogatron leader, Kathleen Turner as his wife, Jeffrey Wright as Tony; and director Taika Waititi as Glootie. Sherri Shepherd, who voiced the Judge in the previous episode, returned to the series as the voice of Tony's wife. A preview of the episode was released on July 19, 2019. = Themes = In a review by Entertainment Weekly, Omar Sanchez assumes the episode to be titled after the 2018 film The Old Man and the Gun, in which the lead character (portrayed by Robert Redford) goes on a heist spree and reflects on his younger self and the final statement he's making, observing the lead character's similarity with Rick, whom they noticed has lost his agency within the Smith household. Vulture's Liz Shannon Miller noted that the episode mainly explores the themes of loneliness and isolation. Heavy attributes the title to be a reference to Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea, in which an old man, waning in his abilities, struggles to catch a giant marlin. The episode also introduces the chemical \\"Globafin\\", which taps into a person's brain and creates a Matrix-like simulation of that person's ideal heaven. In an analysis by IGNs Jesse Schedeen, he wrote that Jerry's desired heaven adequately presents him as a character who constantly battles his own feelings of inadequacy and laments his chronic unemployment.  Reception  = Broadcast and ratings = The episode was broadcast by Adult Swim on November 17, 2019. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"The Old Man and the Seat\\" was seen by 1.66 million household viewers in the United States and received a 0.97 rating among the 18‚Äì49 adult demographic, making it the lowest rated episode of the series (excluding the unannounced season 3 premiere) since season 1‚Äôs \\"Something Ricked This Way Comes\\". = Critical response = The A.V. Clubs Zack Handlen gave the episode a \\"B+\\" rating, writing that \\"while the end result is pretty funny and thematically coherent\\", he also felt it as just \\"slightly under-done\\". Entertainment Weekly gave the episode an \\"A\\" rating. Steve Greene of IndieWire gave it a \\"B-\\" rating, and described it as \\"the equivalent of a mild inconvenience\\", remarking that \\"reinforcing some old ideas, Rick's quest for ultimate privacy and a globe-enslaving dating app are a flimsy foundation for a repetitive episode.\\" Vulture's Liz Shannon Miller gave it a three-out-of-five star rating, and wrote that \\"From the simplest of setups comes, once again, a Rick and Morty adventure that simultaneously goes completely haywire even while it exposes the innermost pathos of its characters.\\" Reviewing for Den of Geek, Joe Matar praised the extraordinary parings of Beth and Summer, Jerry and Morty, and Rick alone with himself as going \\"mostly extremely well.\\" Ray Flook of Bleeding Cool described its concept as combining of the emotional gut-punch of the ending to the second season episode \\"Auto Erotic Assimilation\\" with the chainsaw-slicing social satire found in \\"Rick Potion No. 9\\" and any of the \\"Interdimensional Cable\\" segments.

Today the name lives on as part of the Broad Oak Farm which is located on part of the original estate.  History  Though Dedham was intended to be a Utopian commune, and there was little disparity in wealth, Richards went by the title of \\"Gent\\" and, unlike others, aspired to a manor. He received large tracts of land, second only to the minister, John Allin. One such tract of land was originally owned by a Mr. Cook, who was probably from Watertown. After Cook's death, the land was sold by his estate to Anthony Fisher in 1652. The next year, Fisher sold it to Henry Phillips. This land eventually became Broad Oak. Richards purchased the property sometime between 1653 and 1670 and, while no record exists recording the transfer, it is suspected it was closer to 1670. Early records of the town indicate that Richards was interested in building a \\"manor house\\" on his extensive land holdings. The Broad Oak estate and house were located northwest of the Dedham village, on a bend in the Charles River, off West Street near the present day border of Needham. Edward Richards left the property to his son, Nathaniel, and Nathaniel left it to his son, Edward. It then passed down through generations of the Richards family, to Nathaniel, James, Ebenezer, and finally to Deacon Jonathan Richards. Jonathan sold it to his friend and minister, Rev. Ebenezer Burgess of the Allin Congregational Church. The land was surveyed in 1831 and a deed drawn up then, but it was not recorded until 1838. It is presumed that Jonathan Richards, a widower, may have lived on the land for a time after he sold it to Burgess. Burgess tore down the Richards home and built a new mansion on the lot in 1839. Burgess operated it as an \\"extensive cattle farm.\\" When and horse and buggy were stolen from the estate in 1904, the Society in Dedham for Apprehending Horse Thieves attempted to capture the criminal. As of 1942, some of the original Richards estate was still in the hands of Richards family. The Burgess family remained at Broad Oak at least until the 1940s when State Representative John K. Burgess lived there.

He was the son of Brosi M√ºller and Magdalena Lutz.  Life  Bernhard M√ºller attended the Grammar School of Ochsenhausen Abbey from the age of eight until he was 15. He came to St. Gallen in 1574 and took his vows on 17 December 1576. He studied syntax, humanities, rhetoric, and philosophy from 1577 until 1583. On 19 April 1582 he became baccalaureus philosophiae, on 18 June 1583 he became licentiatus and on 21 June of the same year he became magister artium liberalium summa cum laude. He authored a number of Latin poems. From 1583 he was subdeacon in Saint Gall and became deacon and priest in 1584. Four years later, on 5 May 1588, he became baccalaureus theologiae in Dillingen. He became licentiatus theologiae on 11 December 1589 and finally ‚Äì after public disputation ‚Äì doctor theologiae on 26 October 1593. This allowed him to preach in St. Gallen and neighbouring parishes, which he frequently did. He was elected abbot of Saint Gall on 27 August 1594. Pope Clement VIII confirmed him on 12 December 1594 in Rome. There were several complications with the Curia. He received the papal blessing on 16 October 1595 (Clement VIII wrote a papal breve on 18 March 1595 against electoral capitulations which were settled at Bernhard's election). In April 1595, M√ºller received the obeisance of his subordinates. On 14 June 1595, Emperor Rudolf II confirmed the jura regalia. On 13 April 1630, he abdicated his abbacy for reasons connected with his health.  Works  Shortly after his appointment as abbot, the nuncio Portia announced a visitation, which would be held in conjunction with Abbot Georg von Weingarten from 25 January until 13 February 1595. The resulting visitation protocol was fundamental for Bernhard's reform policies in the monastery. He also instituted reforms in other monasteries such as Fulda and Engelberg by sending conventual friars from the Abbey of Saint Gall as administrators. In 1602, M√ºller founded the Swiss Congregation of the Benedictine Confederation with his colleagues from Einsiedeln, Muri, and Fischingen. In the same year, Saint Gall began to challenge Konstanz for the ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the Saint Gall territory. The Roman Rota ruled in favour of Saint Gall on 1 March 1613. In 1613 the office of a judicial vicar was established in Saint Gall in a concordat with Konstanz. At the same time, parishes within the abbey's region were removed from the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the bishop of Konstanz. P. Jodok Metzler became the first judicial vicar of the Princely Abbey of Saint Gall on 22 August 1614. During his abbacy, M√ºller made regular visitations to the parishes, the first in 1603 and then in 1612/13, 1615, 1618, 1621/22, and 1627. During Bernhard's tenure, the economic position of the abbey improved and enabled the acquisition of several properties. He wished to repurchase castle Neu- Ravensburg from the city of Wangen. They had bought the castle in 1586, when the abbey was struggling economically. Bernhard argued that because the purchase price was too low, the sale was void. The Reichskammergericht in Speyer ruled in his favour and he was able to buy back the property for 22'000 gulden. In 1609, Bernhard planned the acquisition of the County of Vaduz and the Lordship of Schellenberg. While these plans never came to fruition, he did purchase several important properties: Homburg and Staringen in 1613, Ebringen in 1621. In 1610, Bernhard introduced the canvas industry in Rorschach. For that purpose he summoned Balthasar Hofmann from Konstanz to Rorschach and established the necessary facilities. He also conducted several church construction projects; for example, St. Johann abbey, which burnt down in 1626, had to be rebuilt. Other projects commissioned by M√ºller included the construction of the Otmarskirche, which was consecrated in 1628, as well as the renovation of three different castles.

She first helped her husband Carl Aller to develop his photolithographic method of image production to establish a magazine containing recipes in 1874. The beautifully illustrated Illustreret Familie-Journal published from 1877 proved to be a huge success. Laura Aller not only had a flair for business, she understood exactly what people wanted to read. As editor-in-chief, she translated articles from the foreign press and added her own stories and poetry. After colour was added in 1895, sales increased dramatically and production was moved to larger premises on Vigerslev All√© in Valby. Aller Media, now based on Havneholmen in Copenhagen's South Harbour, is still run by the Aller family. Early portraits of Laura and Carl Aller Biography Born on 14 January 1849 in Copenhagen, Laura Christiane Bierring was the daughter of the herbalist Lauritz J√∏rgen Bierring (1816‚Äì1854) and Christine Clausen (1816‚Äì1971). Brought up in a modest Copenhagen home, on 20 October 1871 she married the lithographer Carl Julius Aller (1845‚Äì1926) who had become known for inventing a new photolithographic process facilitating the production of multiple copies of the same image. Following their marriage, Laura Aller demonstrated her understanding of what people liked to read by publishing recipes in the Nordisk M√∏nster Tidende in 1874. Even more successful was Illustreret Familie- Journal which came out three years later. Complete with attractive illustrations, it kept people updated on the most important events of the day in an entertaining style with a humorous slant. Laura Aller was instrumental in the magazine's success, handling the accounts, distribution and, above all, content. She not only translated material from foreign sources but wrote short pieces herself, frequently in verse. Within a few years, the magazine was being read by the royal family, city dwellers and country people. Such was the income from sales that the family bought the luxurious Sophienholm manor on Lake Bagsv√¶rd and travelled to the south of France in their own railway car. After a modern production plant had been developed, in 1895 the magazine was the first in Scandinavia to appear in colour. Despite competition from other magazines such as Hjemmet, launched in 1898, the firm continued to expand and in 1900 had to move into larger premises in the Valby district of Copenhagen. In 1912, a paper factory was added. Contributing to the very end, Laura Aller died in Copenhagen on 9 October 1917. She is buried in Vestre Cemetery.

He served for many years as the mayor of Le Relecq-Kerhuon, a small coastal municipality in the extreme north-west of France. In 1889 he was elected to the departmental council, representing the canton (grouping of municipalities and rural administrative districts) of Landerneau. In 1904 he was elected vice- president of the Departmental council for Finist√®re. His electoral fortunes were otherwise mixed, but he retained his mayoral position till 1914, at which point he was succeeded in the post by his son (also called L√©opold Maissin). It was not his political career but his career with the Poudrerie nationale de Sevran-Livry that brought his name to wider attention. He distinguished himself as an exceptionally inventive engineer with the explosives manufacturer. In 1907 he became a director of the company's powder mill at Pont-de-Buis-l√®s-Quimerch, in succession to the engineer-politician Albert Louppe. The munitions firm hit the headlines in connection with the explosions and sinkings, in 1907 and 1911, of the I√©na and the Libert√©, two battleships anchored at the vast Toulon naval base. The disasters were traced back to \\"Powder B\\" (Nitrocellulose gunpowder), recently introduced to the formulation of explosives used by the navy, and which was found to have become unstable, thus triggering the explosions. Disagreement arose over whether or not the product issues resulted from sub-standard ingredients having been delivered to the \\"Moulin-Blanc\\" plant (till 1907 under the control of L√©opold Maissin) by the \\"Pont-de-Buis\\" factory (at the time when the unstable explosives were produced under the direction, of Albert Louppe), or from failure to implement proper inspections of raw materials delivered to the \\"Pont-de-Buis\\" manufacturing plant. The apparently spontaneous sinkings of two major battleships within four years had caught the attention of many influential people both inside and beyond the political establishment: much of the intense and unresolved rancour that ensued between Louppe and Maissin was played out in full public view through the press and other political channels of the time. Biography L√©opold Emmanuel Louis Eug√®ne Maissin was born in Paris. =Political= In 1889, standing as a republican candidate, Maissin was elected to membership of the departmental council, representing the canton of Landerneau. His election became contentious in some quarters because workers at Poudrerie nationale's Moulin-Blanc powder mill and agricultural workers from the locality were allegedly placed under \\"shameless pressure\\" (\\"pression √©hont√©e\\") to vote for him, according to a report in La Presse which appeared on 1 January 1890. He continued to serve as a councillor for well over a dozen years even, in 1904, being elected vice-president of the Departmental council for Finist√®re. He did not contest the 1913 elections. On the national scene, L√©opold Maissin was a candidate in the by-election triggered by the resignation of the local member of the French national parliament (\\"Chambre des d√©put√©s\\"), Joseph-Marie Boucher. Maissin represented the republicans in the second electoral district (\\"Deuxi√®me circonscription\\") of Brest. He was knocked out in the first round of voting however, by the conservative candidate √âmile Villiers who secured 7,479 votes to Maisson's 4,460. He stood again in the general election of 20 August 1893, but was again beaten in the first round by √âmile Villiers who this time won 6,479 votes against the 3,560 cast for Maissin. In 1908 he was a candidate in the senate elections, but once again he failed to secure election. =The engineer and plant director= L√©opold Maissin was admitted to the prestigious √âcole Polytechnique in 1873. In a decree issued by the Ministry for War dated 6 June 1876, L√©opold Maissin was one of six students nominated \\"√©l√®ve ing√©nieur\\" (literally, \\"pupil engineer\\"). In 1890, by now a qualified \\"ing√©nieur des poudres\\" (literally, [explosives] engineer\\")\\", Maissin was sent by Ministry for War Charles de Freycinet as a government delegate to Russia as part of the preparation for a Franco-Russian Alliance which would lay the ground work for the important diplomatic and military developments during the first half of the twentieth century. His mission was \\"to assist the administration of the Imperial [Russian] Artillery with organisation various production facilities for smokeless powder\\". Maissin brought an unusual breadth of knowledge and insight to his research at the Poudrerie nationale de Sevran-Livry. A high-point came in 1882 when of the first \\"peroxydehunting powder\\" (\\"poudre de chasse peroxyl√©\\"), using a compound of guncotton or cellulose nitrate and \\"fulmicoton\\" went on sale. A patent for this invention was lodged on 22 April 1888, bringing it into the industrial and academic mainstream. The new compound formed the basis for what came to be called \\"Powder-B\\" explosives (\\"poudre de guerre\\") which was now adopted for use by the navy. Tests were conducted by the explosives engineer and factory director Albert Louppe at the \\"Moulin-Blanc\\" munitions plant, located in the Costour Valley which, administratively, came under the control of the municipality of Le Relecq- Kerhuon near Brest after a reconfiguration of local authority boundaries in 1895. With the backing of the French navy major industrial-scale production of \\"Powder-B\\" was built up at the \\"Moulin-Blanc\\" facility. As the inventor of this important new product, L√©opold Maissin was appointed plant director at \\"Moulin Blanc\\". Albert Louppe now concentrated his managerial attention on the company's powder mill at Pont-de-Buis-l√®s-Quimerch. The cotton-powder used in the manufacturing process came from waste oils from cotton production in England or even sometimes, despite the increasing political tensions across the two sides of the \\"Hochrhein\\", from cotton factories in Germany. This dependency on imports was reduced in 1903 with the opening of a French factory for the treatment of cotton waste at Traon-√âlorn {Landerneau} along the √âlorn estuary. The final decades of the nineteenth century had been years of intensifying nationalism across Europe. Nevertheless, much of the more technically advanced factory investment in France during this period came from abroad: the Traon-√âlorn factory was funded by French capital, however. The politician and prominent industrialist Albert Louppe was an important backer. L√©opold Maissin, meanwhile, having previously opposed the development, became a backer of the Grande-Palud powder factory a rival enterprise also located in Landerneau, but financed by German investors. =Acrimony and Albert Louppe= The Finist√®re explosives manufacturers found themselves on the receiving end of unwelcome nationwide publicity following explosions at the Military port of Toulon of the battleships I√©na in 1907 and Libert√© in 1911. The Libert√© explosion also caused extensive damage to other battleships anchored nearby. It was reported that along with the damage to the navy ships, the incidents had each caused several hundred deaths. The cause of both explosion was traced back to \\"Powder B\\" (Nitrocellulose gunpowder), recently introduced to battleship guns in place of \\"Powder N\\" (traditional gunpowder), which was determined to have become unstable over time. L√©opold Maissin, who had taken over from Albert Louppe as plant director of the powder mill at Pont-de-Buis- l√®s-Quimerch, insisted that the catastrophic explosions at Toulon had resulted from failures in the manufacturing process at Pont-de-Buis. The key ingredient in \\"Powder B\\" was cotton-powder, processed from cotton waste at the \\"Moulin blanc\\", where Maissin had been in charge till 1907. On taking over at the \\"Powder B\\" factory in 1907, Maissin stated, noticed that he had identified a problem with the cotton-powder being used. Old and defective cotton-powder was being chemically rejuvenated and then used for the manufacture of \\"Powder B\\". Maissin, who regarded this practice as highly risky, had put an end to it. However, the explosions at the Toulon naval base in 1907 and 1911 had resulted from the condition of \\"Powder B\\" that had been sold and delivered to the navy when Albert Louppe was responsible for the manufacturing plant. Reports surfaced that the container for the \\"Powder B\\" implicated were marked with a code signifying \\"Second Batch of 1906, Pont-de-Buis.\\" Subjected to questioning by members of parliament and by the departmental council (\\"conseil g√©n√©ral\\") for Finist√®re, L√©opold Maissin expressed himself on the matter in detail and at length. He added that he had sent several reports expressing his concern about the use of defective ingredients in the manufacture of \\"Powder B\\" on his predecessor's watch, but his reports had been \\"stifled\\" (\\"√©touff√©s\\") because those responsible were reluctant for the navy to have to throw away large quantities of expensive explosives. In 1911 he told the departmental council (\\"conseil g√©n√©ral\\") for Finist√®re (whose members included Albert Louppe that on 20 March 1907, eight days before the I√©na disaster, he had addressed a letter to Gaston Thomson, the government minister with responsibility for the navy, highlighting problems with several consignments of \\"Powder B\\", identifying the officials to be singled out for questioning and spelling out the threats to the navy. A number of further complications were adduced concerning who had said what when to whom and the extent to which Maissin's attempts to alert government to the risks really had been stifled. At least one report of the matter from 1911 also mentions an already long-standing animosity between L√©opold Maissin and Albert Louppe. G√©n√©ral Gaudin, a soldier-politician who at this time was serving as the national director responsible for \\"powders and saltpetres\\", was mandated by the minister for war to review Maissin's accusations. Gaudin's investigations were summarized in a report dated 5 November 1911: his work had included a meticulous audit of the various letters that Maissin had submitted to a succession of ministers for war,and others in positions of national authority, over the previous four and a half years. In order to try and simplify matters, the report suggested that the criticisms and accusations of Maissin might best be classified under three headings: * I. Reprehensible or even fraudulent practices followed by M.Louppe: :a) on the one hand in respect of the Powder-B manufacturing processes in place at \\"Pont-de-Buis\\" :b) on the other hand with regard to the [principal ingredient, the] cotton-powder when this same engineer [by implication, Albert Louppe again] took over from M.Maissin at \\"Moulin-Blanc\\". * II. Irregular or even fraudulent procedures set in place by M.Louppe in respect of accepting at the goods-in department consignments of powder that were not of sufficient condition to be acceptable. * III. Deficient manufacturing processes identified by the authorities (\\"...par le services des poudres\\"): insufficient controls at goods-in (\\"Insufficance des conditions de r√©ception\\"). Albert Louppe responded with accusations against L√©opold Maissin, as director at \\"Moulin-Blanc\\" before the switching of their responsibilities, and thereby then supplier of poor quality cotton-powder, of having been the originator of the poor quality of the \\"Powder-B\\" for which the cotton-powder had been the key ingredient. The controversy festered between the two men and more widely in the public space. There was a public interest in avoiding damaging rivalry between Louppe and Maissin. The ministry had already, in 1906, intervened to keep them apart in 1906 by sending L√©opold Maissin to take charge of the powder mill at Lille, while the director of the Lille facility was sent to take charge at \\"Moulin-Blanc\\". Maissin had returned to Finist√®re during 1907, however. In 1911 The government responded to the increasingly public nature of the dispute by ordering the dismissal of both men a couple of days after receiving Gaudin's report. That report was followd by a parliamentary commission of enquiry. Camille Chautemps reported on behalf of the commission which noted that the revelations of L√©opold Maissin had confirmed the presence of \\"indiscipline that was rife in certain powder mills because their directors flattered their unionised work forces in order to obtain their electoral support\\". The political ambitions of the two directors caught up in the matter, Albert Louppe and L√©opold Maissin, were in that sense a direct cause of the explosions at Toulon harbour. There was, the commission found, no risk inherent in the formulation of \\"Powder B\\". Responding with the careful precision for which this former lawyer and freemason was known, the minister for war Alexandre Millerand accepted the commission's findings and undertook to set down a set of \\"uniform rules\\" for the manufacture of \\"Powder B\\". Millerand added that during a recent visit to (a rival plant in) Angoul√™me he had been made aware of recent (unspecified) improvements in the production processes that within a few months would enable the French manufacturers to match the standards of the best in the world. Personal L√©opold Maissin married Eug√©nie Vincent. The marriage is known to have been followed by the birth of at least one child: their son L√©opold Albert Marie Alexandre Maissin was born on 14 October 1879.

Biography Kemp was born in the Bellahouston district of Glasgow and appears to have been largely self-taught as an artist but may have taken lessons in London before spending 1903 and 1904 in Paris where she attended the Academie Julian. After leaving Paris, Kemp travelled widely and spent time in the Netherlands, Italy and north Africa. She showed some landscape paintings of France at a group show in Glasgow in 1907 and subsequently exhibited with the Glasgow Society of Lady Artists, the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts and the Royal Scottish Academy. She often painted figures on beaches and interior scenes bathed in light, particularly from the south of France. From 1912 to 1914 Kemp had a number of solo exhibitions at Macindoe's Gallery in Glasgow and also exhibited with the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Paris from 1912 with a number of her works being purchased by the French government. Kemp worked in Paris hospitals as a nurse-masseuse throughout World War I. After the war she remained in France and had solo exhibitions at the Marcel Bernheim Gallery in Paris and at Warneuke's in Glasgow and also at the Galerie de la Libraire de la Presse in Nantes in 1922. Kemp gave up painting around 1927 and remained in France until 1939 when she returned to Britain to live with her sisters in Dorset and later Eastbourne. Retrospective exhibitions of her paintings in 1977 revived interest in Kemp.

Deloitte's Global Powers of Retailing 2019 ranked The Shoprite Group as the 86th largest retailer in the world. Basson retired as the Managing Director and Chief Executive of Shoprite Holdings Ltd on 31 December 2016. This moved him in the list of richest South Africans from 9th to 29th with a net worth of R1,7 billion.  Early life  Basson was born on 8 January 1946 on the family farm Dasbosch in the Porterville, Western Cape district to Jack and Maude Basson. He was one of three children. > When asked in an interview with Bruce Whitfield about the origin of his > nickname, \\"Whitey\\", Basson said that his given names, James Wellwood, \\"came > from a Scottish gentleman who didn't have any children and my father decided > to name me after him... and it didn't go well in Porterville, so they had to > find a shorter name. So I think they kept a 'W' for 'Whitey'... I had, those > days blond hair not white hair, but they didn't know the difference at that > stage in Porterville.\\" He went to school in Porterville and completed his secondary schooling at Rondebosch Boys' High School in Cape Town, where he matriculated in 1963. Basson first considered studying medicine. \\"I wanted to become a medical student, but my mother said I was afraid of blood, so I didn't.\\" Basson said, \\"I actually got admitted to UCT, but I never went there.\\" He attained his BCom CTA from Stellenbosch University and completed his CA(SA) in 1970 after his articles at ER Syfret & Co (now Ernst & Young). He then went to work at Brink, Roos & Du Toit (now PricewaterhouseCoopers) and from mid-1970 and in 1971 he practised as a chartered accountant.  Career  = Pep Stores Ltd = In 1971 Basson was approached by Renier van Rooyen, who was married to a cousin of Christo Wiese, to become the financial director of the retail clothing chain that van Rooyen had founded called Pep Stores Ltd (or as it was locally known \\"Pep\\"). Van Rooyen was planning to list the company on the JSE as Pepkor. Basson agreed to join the company as financial director and in 1974 became head of operations. \\"At the tender age of 28 I should become the business director, or whatever we called it in those days,\\" Basson said. In 1974 he was appointed to the board and remained a member until 2004. By 1981, Pep had grown to 500 stores, 10 factories, 12 000 employees and a turnover of close to R300 million. At this point Christo Wiese bought out van Rooyen's holdings in Pepkor and became the major shareholder. Wiese became the chairman of Pepkor. In 2014 Wiese sold Pepkor to Steinhoff International in exchange for about 20% of Steinhoff's issued shares. = Half Price Group = One of the competitors to Pep in South Africa was the Half Price Group, managed by Sam Stupple. Stupple was in regular contact with Basson regarding the sales figures of the Pep stores and Basson realised that his sales figures were being leaked to Stupple. In retaliation Basson thought: \\"I'll catch him and I sent out a circular that we get into food and then he started applying for food licences!\\" This led the Half Price Group into financial trouble and Basson bought them out as his first major acquisition. = Shoprite = In 1979 Basson wanted to move to trading fast-moving consumer goods and he reached an agreement with the board of Pep Stores which allowed him to either actively identify opportunities for acquisition of a food retailer or to start a new venture in food retailing. He found a small eight-store grocery chain in the Western Cape called Shoprite, still owned by the founding Rogut family, which he then acquired. \\"Barney Rogut was also fantastic to teach me food and he then taught me how to run a supermarket,\\" said Basson. Basson restructured Shoprite to optimise its growth by focusing on the largest economically active segment of South Africa's population, the middle-to-lower LSM market. Acquisitions and turnarounds of struggling companies also became a priority. In 1986, Shoprite was listed on the JSE although its net asset value was the R1 million paid for the original eight stores and any accumulated profits. In 2019 Shoprite had secondary listings on the Namibian stock exchange (since 2002) and Zambian stock exchange (since 2003). Under Basson's leadership, from 2010 Shoprite had become the single biggest South African grocery retailer with 34% market share. In 2019 Shoprite had revenue of R150 billion, market capitalisation of R114 billion, more than 2 300 stores and 140 000 employees across 15 African countries. Deloitte's Global Powers of Retailing 2019 survey (covering the 2017 financial year) ranked The Shoprite Group as the 86th largest retailer in the world. = Ackermans = In 1984, Basson's first acquisition was the six Ackermans food stores, which at that point were owned by the Edgars Group. This was the company's entry point into the rural market. Basson and Raymond Ackerman (whose father had started Ackermans) were rivals and crossed paths for decades. Basson bought the food business at Ackermans food stores in the 80's. Ackerman had run Checkers and had \\"so famously got fired from\\" it and had then gone and started Pick n Pay. = Grand Bazaars = In 1990 Basson approached Carlos Dos Santos and bought Grand Bazaars at what was considered an even better price than the original deal. Basson said, \\"I walked through his fridges one day and I saw, but some of the fridges are switched off. They only stocked Coke and some of Gerald's cooldrinks, which didn't need cooling. So I phoned him I said, 'Carlos, I see you're a bit short of money. Can't we talk about your Grand Bazaars?' And he says come and see me in Jo'burg. So we did a handshake deal and that was it. I'm not sure, but I think we paid slightly less than what he paid.\\" = Checkers Stores = By 1998 Shoprite had branches in the remote North Western Cape and Mpumalanga provinces but was still considered too small to be competition to South Africa's major supermarket chains, Pick n Pay Stores, OK Bazaars and Checkers. However, Checkers was falling into financial difficulties. It had 169 stores and was making losses that equalled Shoprite's turnover and more than 16 000 jobs were at stake. Shoprite came to dominate the Western Cape market and approached Checkers on two occasions. On the first occasion the owners of Checkers \\"held unrealistic perceptions of the value of unfocussed and inefficient retail stores,\\" according to Basson. \\"It was never a bad business. It was badly focussed as it could have been.\\" On the second occasion a deal was struck, with the aid of Basson's personal relationship with the chairman of Sanlam, Marinus Darling, that resulted in a reverse listing of Shoprite into Checkers' holding company as Shoprite Checkers Group. It took Basson nine months to revive Checkers' fortunes. > Checkers \\"had different cultural sort of backgrounds too,\\" said Basson. \\"And > when I got to Checkers it was fantastic, because they said that about 1 > o'clock I have to have lunch in this beautiful dining room with waiters with > white gloves. It was very nice... different three courses and everything. > And I looked at the people round the table and I said 'You know guys we're > losing 45 million rands a year. This lunch is in conflict with what I think > we should be making and where we should be going.' And I said, 'Did you guys > hear of the last supper? Well this is the last lunch', and we didn't have a > lunch there again.\\" The addition of Checkers brought the Shoprite Checkers Group to 241 stores with enough clout to compete for better rates in the modern shopping centres that were being developed in South Africa at that time. \\"In fact, a lot of the landlords didn't want us in the supermarkets,\\" Basson said. \\"The landlords started taking us seriously at the stage when we bought Checkers, because they didn't have too many options left.\\" \\"They are not the easiest people to deal with,\\" says Stephan le Roux of property management company Growthpoint. \\"They are hard negotiators. I like working with this client. There are arguments along the way, but they play open cards.\\" There was some criticism by financial analysts of the continued trading under two brand names but Basson saw it as target market segmentation. = Ok Bazaars = The OK brand was created in Eloff Street, Johannesburg in 1927 but by 1997 the fortunes of OK Bazaars had waned to such an extent that the sole shareholder, SA Breweries, disposed of its stake in OK Bazaars to Shoprite for R1, despite the market cap of OK Bazaars being much larger than that of Shoprite. The deal gave Shoprite 139 'OK' stores, 18 'Hyperamas' and 21 'House & Homes' and saved 14 000 jobs. Basson returned OK Bazaars to profitability by focusing store brands in particular areas and markets: 'OK Bazaars' were turned into OK franchises; 'OK Furniture' and 'House and Home' were consolidated into 'OK Furniture'; 'Hyperama' stores became 'Checkers Hyper' and more than 150 food stores were modernised. = Pick n Pay = During 2001, Basson devised a strategy to reposition the Checker's brand as close as possible to its higher LSM major rival, Pick n Pay. The Shoprite stores would then be focussed on the middle LSM's and a new chain called USave was created to focus on the lowest LSM's. USave had a cost structure that would allow it to reduce its gross margin by 50% while still offering good return on investment. This repositioning resulted in the Shoprite Checkers Group growing to almost 30% market share of the South African formal retail food market. = International = Basson dreamt of expanding Shoprite across the African continent. In 1995, the first Shoprite was opened in Lusaka, Zambia. In 2019 the group had stores in Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Eswatini, Uganda and Zambia. Stores in Egypt, India and Tanzania were not successful and had to be closed down.  Awards  * 2010 - DComm (honoris causa) awarded by Stellenbosch University. * 2016 - Pioneer Award \\"for contribution to the industry\\" from the SA Council of Shopping Centres  Retirement  Basson retired as the Managing Director and Chief Executive of Shoprite Holdings Ltd on 31 December 2016. Following his retirement, Basson served for nine months on the Shoprite Holdings board as non-executive vice-chairman to ensure an orderly leadership transition. He was succeeded by Pieter Engelbrecht, former chief operating officer. Basson's salary for 2016 was R100,1 million including a R50 million bonus. This was the subject of a protest action by COSATU on World Day for Decent Work 2016. On 5 May 2017, Shoprite announced that Basson was selling 8,58 million Shoprite shares with a value of R1,8 billion rands which the company was obliged to purchase in terms of an employment agreement completed in 2003. This figure represented less than 2% of the value of Shoprite. \\"I have no ambition to buy a big yacht or have a second wife or move the money out of the country,\\" Basson said. Basson remains active in other business activities. In 2017 he was appointed as one of the independent, non- executive directors of Clover South Africa.  Personal life  Basson lives with his family on Klein DasBosch wine estate on the banks of the Blaauwklippen river in the Western Cape. In 2004 he participated in the Ice Bucket challenge and donated R100 000 worth of boerewors to schools for them to use in fund rasing events. ‚ÄúWe need to create jobs in South Africa ... but I also believe we need to teach our children how to be entrepreneurs and create more jobs from a young age,‚Äù Basson said.

Immigration and Naturalization Service, 387 U.S. 118 (1967), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld Clive Michael Boutilier's deportation from the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 due to his history of homosexual activities. The Act itself did not specify homosexuality among its exclusion criteria, but the Court held that Congress clearly intended that a homosexual individual be excluded from entry into the United States as one \\"afflicted with [a] psychopathic personality.\\" The decision was abrogated by the Immigration Act of 1990, which rejected sexual orientation as a basis for excluding an individual from immigration.  Background  = Immigration Investigation = In 1955, at the age of 21, Clive Boutilier immigrated from his native Canada to the United States with his family. In 1963, he attempted to apply for American citizenship, and in his application, he revealed to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) that he had been arrested on a sodomy charge in New York City in 1959. In a subsequent meeting with an INS investigator, Boutilier revealed additional details about his sexual history, which included consensual same-sex activities both before and after he entered the United States. The INS sent documentation about Boutilier's testimony to the Public Health Service (PHS) for review. The PHS then issued a certificate indicating that Boutilier \\"was afflicted with a class A condition, namely, psychopathic personality, sexual deviate, at the time of his admission to the United states for permanent residence on June 22nd, 1955.\\" After receiving this certificate, the INS initiated deportation proceedings against Clive Boutilier based on the exclusion criteria laid out in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Boutilier declined an opportunity to submit to a personal examination by PHS doctors, but he had instead offered letters from two different psychiatrists that both concluded that he was not a psychopathic personality as was understood by medical professionals. The first psychiatrist that he consulted, Dr. Edward Falsey, concluded that Boutilier had a psychosexual problem for which he was now beginning treatment, but that he showed no signs of psychosis and, in his professional opinion, there was no risk that Boutilier would develop psychosis in the future. The second psychiatrist, Dr. Montague Ullman, concluded that his sexuality was \\"fluid and immature\\" and that his homosexual tendencies were due to a dependent personality pattern and a need to be accepted rather than a psychopathic personality. Ultimately, these examinations were of little use to Boutilier's case because immigration officials, as well as officials for the PHS, determined that Congress had intended for homosexuals to be included as part of the term \\"psychopathic personality.\\" So as it related to issues of immigration, it did not matter what medical professionals considered this term to mean. Furthermore, the examinations by these two psychiatrists supported the conclusion that he was a \\"sexual deviate of the homosexual type,\\" so the PHS would still be required to issue a certificate certifying that he had a \\"psychopathic personality.\\" On August 5, 1965, the INS concluded their investigation into Boutilier and ordered that he be deported from the United States and returned to Canada. On January 12, 1966, his appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals was dismissed after they concluded that his deportation order was valid. = Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit = On June 2, 1966, Clive Boutilier's case was argued before the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit before judges Leonard P. Moore, John Joseph Smith, and Irving Kaufman. Boutlier's argument in this case did not dispute his diagnosis as a homosexual. Rather, it contended that the term \\"psychopathic personality\\" cannot be held to include homosexuals. His case relied upon a recent case from the Ninth Circuit, Fleuti v. Rosenberg, 302 F.2d 652 (9th Cir. 1962), where it was held that the term \\"psychopathic personality\\" was not precise enough to adequately warn a prospective immigrant that homosexual activity was proscribed, so it was thus void for vagueness. On July 8, 1966, the Appellate Court returned their decision that the deportation order was valid. The majority opinion, written by Kaufman, upheld the deportation order. In this opinion, Kaufman discussed the legislative history of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 to support the government's claim that Congress had intended to consider homosexuals as excludable. In particular, he noted that some of the initial bills in Congress had specifically included language to exclude \\"aliens who are homosexuals or sex perverts\\" but that the language was eliminated after the PHS advised lawmakers that the \\"provision for the exclusion of aliens afflicted with psychopathic personality...is sufficiently broad to provide for the exclusion of homosexuals and sex perverts.\\" He also rejected the applicability of Fleuti v. Rosenberg. In this case, the deportation order was primarily based upon Boutilier's behavior prior to entry into the United States, but in Fleuti, the proceedings were mostly focused on post-entry behavior. In his opinion, Kaufman rejected the idea that the void- for-vagueness doctrine applied as the exclusion criteria was not meant to regulate conduct by prospective immigrants, but rather, it was meant to exclude immigrants with certain characteristics. Therefore, it did not matter whether or not it was reasonable for Boutilier to understand that homosexual activities were grounds for denial of entry into the United States. However, he did concede that this doctrine may have been applicable in Fleuti because of that case's reliance on post-entry behavior. The dissenting opinion, written by Moore, did not contest the idea that Congress intended homosexuality to be considered as a basis for exclusion under the diagnosis of \\"psychopathic personality.\\" However, Moore did contest the idea that homosexual behavior would always be sufficient to diagnose \\"psychopathic personality\\" as it pertained to the law. In particular, he noted the use of the phrase, \\"frequently include those suffering from sexual deviation\\" from the PHS's testimony in Congress as evidence that there are situations where the presence of homosexual behavior is not indicative of psychopathic personality and thus not sufficient for exclusion from entry into the United States. From here, he started a discussion about the prevalence of homosexual behavior in society, citing the Kinsey Report assessment that 37% of Americans have had at least one homosexual experience, indicating that homosexual behavior alone would be too broad a criterion for exclusion. He then moved his focus to the void-by-vagueness doctrine that was used in Fleuti and dismissed by the majority. He contended that it was applicable to this case because, based on the examinations performed by the two private psychiatrists, it is reasonable to believe that Boutilier could have changed his behavior prior to immigration were he aware that homosexual behavior could be used to exclude him from immigration to the United States. Decision The majority opinion, penned by Tom C. Clark, concluded that Congress had the power to exclude aliens and that Congress intended to include homosexuals in the category of those possessing a \\"psychopathic personality\\". A dissent, by William O. Douglas with Abe Fortas concurring, argued that \\"A label of this kind [psychopathic personality], when freely used, may mean only an unpopular person. It is much too vague by constitutional standards for the imposition of penalties or punishment.\\" According to the dissent, Congress had indeed intended \\"psychopathic personality\\" as a medical term, and that medical professionals did not agree that homosexuality was a form of psychopathic personality.

The Houston Astros sign stealing scandal resulted from a series of rule-breaking actions by the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball, whereby members of the Astros used technological aids to steal signs of opposing teams during the 2017 and 2018 seasons. For years, some individuals on other teams had suspected the Astros of stealing signs, but there was no public reporting on the subject until November 2019, when reporters Ken Rosenthal and Evan Drellich at The Athletic published an article detailing the team's activities. Mike Fiers, a pitcher who played for the Astros in 2017, told The Athletic that the organization used a video camera in center field to film the opposing catcher's signals to the pitcher regarding the next pitch. Astros players or team staffers watching the live camera feed behind the dugout used various audio cues to signal to the batter what type of pitch was coming next. MLB opened an investigation into the allegations and confirmed in January 2020 that the Astros illegally used a camera system to steal signs during the 2017 regular season and postseason, during which they won the World Series, as well as in part of the 2018 season. MLB found no evidence of illicit sign stealing in the 2019 season, in which the Astros advanced to the World Series but lost. As a result, Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow and field manager A. J. Hinch were suspended for the entire 2020 season for failing to prevent the rules violations. The Astros were fined the maximum allowable $5 million and forfeited their first- and second-round picks in the 2020 and 2021 drafts. No players were punished because they had been given immunity by MLB in exchange for their cooperation. The Astros subsequently fired both Luhnow and Hinch on the day their suspensions were announced. MLB's investigation also determined that Boston Red Sox manager Alex Cora helped mastermind the Astros' sign stealing while serving as Hinch's bench coach in 2017; Boston and Cora mutually parted ways the following day, and MLB later suspended Cora through the 2020 postseason. Carlos Beltr√°n was the only Astros player from 2017 who was specifically named in the report; he had been hired to manage the New York Mets in November 2019 but parted ways with the team after the results of MLB's investigation were announced. The sanctions against the Astros were the most severe that MLB has ever issued against a member club, and are among the most severe sanctions for in-game misconduct in baseball history. A Wall Street Journal article published a few weeks after the MLB report described previously unknown details about the sign stealing operation and reported that it originated during the 2016 season, a broader scope than reported by MLB. After the scandal broke, players on the 2017 Astros apologized to varying degrees. The team's actions were heavily criticized by players on other MLB teams. The scandal dominated the 2019‚Äì2020 offseason and the start of 2020 spring training. The scandal also led to lawsuits against the Astros and MLB.  Background  Sign stealing is not inherently against baseball rules and has long been considered part of the game. In 2017, The New York Times wrote that sign stealing was \\"something of an art form in baseball\\" which \\"is tolerated, even admired\\". Many players and coaches are considered masters at stealing signs. However, Major League Baseball (MLB) has long frowned upon the use of technology to steal signs. In 1961, the National League (NL) banned the use of a \\"mechanical device\\" to steal signs. While MLB did not, at the time, specifically ban electronic equipment, it issued a memorandum in 2001 stating that teams cannot use electronic equipment to communicate with each other during games, especially for the purpose of stealing signs. In September 2017, after the Boston Red Sox were fined for using a smartwatch to try to steal signs, Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred issued a memo to all 30 clubs warning that future incidents of electronic sign stealing \\"will be subject to more serious sanctions, including the possible loss of draft picks\\". In 2014, as part of the expansion of replay review in MLB, all 30 teams were permitted to install video replay rooms in their stadiums with live camera feeds, and the dugout was permitted to communicate with staffers in the room. As MLB realized that teams were potentially using the video replay room for other purposes, including sign stealing, MLB placed league officials in the replay rooms for the first time beginning in the 2018 playoffs. Prior to the 2019 season, MLB reached an agreement with the MLB Players Association to institute new rules restricting the use of live camera feeds by placing a league official in all 30 replay rooms, and allowing only replay officials to watch in real time while others could only watch with an eight-second delay. Tom Verducci of Sports Illustrated said that the ban would include \\"all non- broadcast outfield cameras from foul pole to foul pole as well as tightening restrictions on in-house video\\". The Astros finished in first place in the American League (AL) West division for the 2017 season with a win‚Äìloss record of 101-61. They defeated the Red Sox, three games to one, in the 2017 AL Division Series, including two wins at home at Minute Maid Park and one win away at Fenway Park. They defeated the New York Yankees in the 2017 AL Championship Series in seven games, winning all four home games at Minute Maid Park while losing all three road games at Yankee Stadium. In the World Series, the Astros defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in seven games, going 2‚Äì2 at Dodger Stadium and 2‚Äì1 at Minute Maid Park. It was their first World Series championship in franchise history. The Astros finished in first place in the AL West again in 2018 with a 103‚Äì59 record but lost the AL Championship Series to the Red Sox. Houston returned to the World Series in 2019, losing to the Washington Nationals in seven games. Speculation and accusations of sign stealing Speculation about sign stealing by the Astros had been rampant for a number of years. The Astros were not the only team to be suspected of sign stealing; paranoia about electronic sign stealing was high around the league. After the scandal broke in 2019, many members of the Dodgers organization said that they had suspected the Astros were illegally stealing signs during the 2017 World Series. Andrew Friedman, the President of Baseball Operations for the Dodgers, stated that \\"there was just a lot of speculation at the time about it\\". The Cleveland Indians caught an Astros employee taking pictures of their dugout during the 2018 AL Division Series and warned the Red Sox, who faced the Astros in the AL Championship Series. The same man was found taking pictures of the Red Sox dugout in the AL Championship Series. The Yankees asked MLB to investigate whistling sounds that they believed were meant to relay signs to batters in Game 1 of the 2019 AL Championship Series, but MLB said they found no wrongdoing. Astros manager A. J. Hinch mocked the Yankees for the accusation, saying: \\"it made me laugh because it's ridiculous. And had I known that it would take something like that to set off the Yankees or any other team, we would have practiced it in spring training.\\" The Yankees also reportedly alleged that the Astros were using blinking lights beyond the center-field fences to relay stolen signs in Game 6 of the series. Before the 2019 World Series, Joe Torre and other MLB officials had an unusual pre-series meeting with the GMs and managers of both teams to warn them against using cameras on the dugouts or catchers or using electronics in the dugout. Multiple Nationals players were contacted by other players around the league to warn them about the Astros. One unnamed Nationals player told The Washington Post, \\"It was amazing, once [it was assured] we were playing the Astros, how many people were coming out of the woodwork to let us know what they were doing.\\" The Nationals developed a complex system of mixing signs to thwart any attempts to steal signs by the Astros in the World Series. The Nationals went on to beat the Astros by winning four away games at Minute Maid Park. Minute Maid Park, the Astros' home ballpark, in 2010 On November 12, 2019, journalists Ken Rosenthal and Evan Drellich published a story in The Athletic detailing for the first time specific allegations that the Astros had engaged in illicit electronic sign stealing. Mike Fiers, a pitcher who played for the Astros in 2017, stated that a center-field camera feed was sent to the tunnel behind the Astros dugout in Minute Maid Park. An Astros player or staff member then hit a trash can to signal specific different pitches to the batter at home plate. In addition to Fiers, unnamed sources were cited in the article. MLB began an investigation the day after the Athletic story was published. Jeff Luhnow, the general manager of the Astros, stated that the Astros organization was \\"going to look into the allegations in cooperation with Major League Baseball\\". Internet sports personality Jimmy \\"Jomboy\\" O'Brien published videos on YouTube and Twitter, sourced from MLB.TV archives, that appeared to clearly show the scheme playing out in real time. In one such clip from an Astros game against the Chicago White Sox, banging could clearly be heard whenever White Sox catcher Kevan Smith called for pitcher Danny Farquhar to throw a changeup. The White Sox subsequently changed their signs to thwart the Astros. Jomboy argued that this \\"upsetting\\" sequence proved there was no way the Astros could have obtained the signs without the help of technology. Others on social media joined Jomboy in posting video clips alleging to demonstrate the Astros' sign-stealing scheme. Joon Lee from ESPN.com credited \\"social media sleuthing skills\\" with helping shape the league's investigation by reducing the amount of time needed to review video for evidence. In a subsequent report from The Athletic, it was reported that an Astros executive had asked scouts for help stealing signs and suggested using cameras in an August 2017 email. Further allegations regarding other means of relaying signs, such as whistling, surfaced in subsequent weeks. There was also speculation that the Astros had developed more advanced ways to relay stolen signs to hitters. Joel Sherman of the New York Post reported, \\"In recent days I have had scouts and executives talk to me about a variety of methods they think have been or could be employed, such as a realistic-looking electronic bandage placed on a player's body that buzzes in real time to signal what is coming.\\" According to a Washington Post report published in February 2020, as many as ten to twelve teams had complained about potential sign stealing by the Astros over the years. Most members of the Astros organization kept silent publicly throughout the investigation. The day after the original Athletic article, former Astros player Carlos Beltr√°n denied having knowledge of the alleged scheme. Hinch appeared at a press conference during the annual Winter Meetings and said he was cooperating with MLB but declined to comment further. In a January Houston Chronicle article published before MLB announced the findings from its investigation, Astro Carlos Correa expressed surprise that Fiers had made the accusations. Joe Musgrove said, \\"I wasn't even in the dugout for any of that stuff,\\" and Alex Bregman and George Springer declined to comment. Rosenthal wrote one week after the original report that he and Drellich \\"also heard ‚Äî and continue to hear ‚Äî about possible violations by a number of other clubs.\\" Illicit sign stealing was a hot topic at the offseason GM meetings and Winter Meetings.  MLB investigation report and discipline  Commissioner Rob Manfred began an investigation into the Astros' sign stealing after The Athletics article. Days after The Athletics article alleging the Astros' sign stealing, Manfred stated that MLB was conducting a \\"really, really thorough\\" investigation. During the investigation, it was publicly reported that witnesses admitted that the Astros used a system to relay pitch types to batters. In December, Tom Verducci of Sports Illustrated reported that the investigation had expanded to cover the 2018 season, and MLB investigators were combing through 70,000 emails and had conducted 70 interviews. On January 13, 2020, Manfred announced the results of the investigation, confirming that the Astros had illegally used a video camera system to steal signs in the 2017 regular season and postseason, and in parts of the 2018 regular season. The report detailed that two months into the 2017 season, Astros bench coach Alex Cora and a group of players which included Beltr√°n worked to create a system to steal signs. One or more players would watch the live feed on a monitor behind the dugout, and decode the signs. The players initially experimented with clapping, whistling, and yelling, but determined banging a trash can with a bat was most effective. One or two bangs corresponded to a breaking ball, and no banging indicated a fastball. In addition to the banging method, Astros employees in the video room would also decode signs and send information to the dugout to be relayed to runners on second base who would relay signs to the batter. Players were concerned about their method being discovered by other teams, and several players said there was a sense of \\"panic\\" in the dugout after White Sox pitcher Danny Farquhar appeared to notice the banging in a September 2017 game. After the Farquhar incident, the Astros replaced the wall-mounted monitor and used a portable monitor in the postseason. The team continued using illicit methods to steal signs in the 2017 postseason (though Manfred later said there was \\"conflicting evidence\\" about whether it continued into the postseason or not). The Astros did not use the banging method in 2018, but continued to use other methods until players decided it was no longer effective and stopped at some point in the 2018 season. The investigation found no evidence of sign stealing in their pennant-winning 2019 season. The Astros were fined $5 million, the maximum allowed by the MLB constitution, and forced to forfeit their first- and second-round draft picks in 2020 and 2021. In addition, Luhnow and Hinch were each suspended for the entire 2020 season, including the playoffs. The investigation revealed that Luhnow did not know about the banging scheme, though he had \\"some knowledge\\" about replay room staffers decoding signs and transmitting them to the dugout, contrary to his denials. Manfred found that while Luhnow didn't know about the players' role in the scheme, he should have made it his business to know about the players' activities, especially in light of earlier sign-stealing scandals. According to Manfred, had Luhnow taken \\"adequate steps\\" to ensure the Astros followed the rules, the sign stealing operation could have been shut down as early as Manfred's September 2017 memo, and certainly by March 2018, when MLB disciplinarian Joe Torre issued a memo which clarified the ban on using technology to steal signs. Manfred wrote that since the general manager was responsible for ensuring compliance with \\"both standards of conduct set by Club ownership and MLB Rules,\\" he was holding Luhnow \\"personally accountable for the conduct of his Club.\\" The investigation found that Hinch did not approve of the use of the replay monitor in this manner, and even destroyed it on two occasions. However, he did allow it to continue through the team's run to the 2017 World Series. Manfred harshly criticized him for this, saying that since the manager is responsible for directly supervising the players and coaches, there was \\"no justification for Hinch's failure to act\\". Although Hinch regretted his failure to act, Manfred said that he had to hold him responsible for it. No players were punished because they had been given immunity by MLB in exchange for their cooperation. MLB reportedly made the immunity deal with players because it believed it would not win grievances from the players union if it attempted to discipline players. In his report Manfred said it was \\"difficult and impractical\\" to determine degrees of culpability by players due to the sheer number of players involved. He placed primary responsibility on Luhnow and Hinch, saying that the general manager and field manager are responsible for \\"ensuring that the players both understand the rules and adhere to them\\". If Luhnow and Hinch were to commit further \\"material violations\\" of baseball rules, they will be permanently banned from baseball. Additionally, Luhnow will be required to undergo \\"management/leadership training\\" while he is suspended. Hinch's year-long suspension was the second-most severe punishment in baseball history meted out to a manager for in-game misconduct. The only longer suspension was for St. Louis Browns manager Jack O'Connor, who was banned for life for trying to throw the 1910 American League batting title to Nap Lajoie by bribing the official scorer to change an error to a hit in the final game of the season. Firings Only hours after MLB announced its findings, Astros owner Jim Crane fired Luhnow and Hinch, saying, \\"Neither one of them started this but neither one of them did anything about it.\\" Crane said he was going beyond MLB's sanctions because he had \\"higher standards for the city and the franchise\\". Manfred had cleared Crane of wrongdoing at the beginning of his report, saying that Crane was \\"extraordinarily troubled and upset\\" by the revelations and had fully cooperated. A day later, on January 14, 2020, the Red Sox and Cora ‚Äì their manager at the time ‚Äî mutually agreed to part ways as a result of his involvement in the scandal. The investigation found that Cora was closely involved in implementing the scheme, as well as using the replay room to decode signs. Based on those findings, both Cora and Red Sox officials concluded that he could not effectively lead the team into 2020 and beyond. Although Manfred deferred a decision on discipline for Cora until after a separate investigation into video sign stealing during the championship run by the 2018 Red Sox, it was widely expected that he would receive a lengthy suspension, at least as long as the one-year suspension meted out to Hinch. On April 22, 2020, Manfred issued findings from MLB's investigation about Boston's 2018 team. The findings focused on the actions of the team's replay operator, who as a result was suspended for the 2020 season (including postseason) and the team forfeited their second-round selection in the 2020 draft. About Cora, Manfred stated: : Alex Cora will be suspended through the conclusion of the 2020 Postseason for his conduct as the bench coach of the Houston Astros in 2017. While I will not impose additional discipline on Cora as a result of the conduct engaged in by [the Red Sox' replay operator] (because I do not find that he was aware of it), I do note that Cora did not effectively communicate to Red Sox players the sign-stealing rules that were in place for the 2018 season. On January 16, 2020, the New York Mets and Beltr√°n ‚Äì who was hired as their manager in the 2019‚Äì2020 offseason ‚Äì mutually agreed to part ways, as he was the only then-Astros player called out by name for his involvement in the scheme. Beltr√°n never managed a game for the Mets. In a statement, he said: \\"As a veteran player on the team, I should've recognized the severity of the issue and truly regret the actions that were taken. I am a man of faith and integrity and what took place did not demonstrate those characteristics that are so very important to me and my family. I'm very sorry. It's not who I am as a father, a husband, a teammate and as an educator.\\" Continued accusations The report and discipline did not stop additional accusations of sign stealing from being made. The release of the report sparked a new frenzy of speculation and rumors on the internet in the week afterward. A Twitter account of a person claiming to be Beltr√°n's niece made accusations about non-Astros players around the league; Beltr√°n's family said the account was fake and some speculated that it actually belonged to a player. Rumors again circulated that Astros players were wearing buzzing electronic devices during the 2019 playoffs that would relay a stolen sign through vibrations, as originally speculated in a report in the New York Post. Altuve released a statement through his agent stating, \\"I have never worn an electronic device in my performance as a major league player.\\" A few days later in a media appearance, Altuve said \\"some people made that up...the best thing that happened to me was that MLB investigated it and found nothing.\\" Reddick called internet speculation that he was wearing a buzzing device \\"ridiculous\\", and Bregman called the buzzer rumors \\"stupid\\". Reactions =Astros reactions= Josh Reddick was the first Astros player made available to speak to the media after the report, and he told reporters, \\"It stinks for everybody involved\\" and, \\"When everyone feels the time is right, it will get taken care of.\\" Bregman and Jos√© Altuve appeared before the media at the Astros annual fan festival in Houston the week the report was released. Bregman answered repeated attempts by reporters to have him address the scandal with variations of the same phrase: \\"The commissioner made his report, made his decision and the Astros made their decision and I have no further comment on it.\\" Altuve was more talkative but said it was too early to comment, saying, \\"I think the time to comment about that will come,\\" while vowing that the Astros would return to the World Series. After Bregman's and Altuve's comments were criticized, Crane promised that the team would hold a press conference at spring training when all the players were together to \\"apologize for what happened, ask for forgiveness and move forward.\\" At the 2019 Baseball Writers Association of America banquet, Justin Verlander, in his acceptance speech for winning the 2019 AL Cy Young Award, said of the Astros \\"as everybody knows, they're very technologically and analytically advanced\\", prompting a mix of boos and laughter from the audience. Dallas Keuchel was the first member of the 2017 Astros to publicly apologize for the scandal. Speaking at a fan convention in February 2020 for his new team, the Chicago White Sox, Keuchel said, \\"It's just what the state of baseball was at that point and time. Was it against the rules? Yes it was, and I personally am sorry for what's come about, the whole situation.\\" Marwin Gonz√°lez was the first position player from the 2017 Astros to publicly apologize, speaking to the media at spring training as a member of the Minnesota Twins, saying, \\"I'm remorseful for everything that happened in 2017, everything that we did as a group and the players that were affected directly by us doing this.\\" Musgrove said about the 2017 championship season, \\"I don't want to say it's tainted, but I think it is.\\" Former Astros hitting coach Dave Hudgens also apologized for his role in the scandal, admitting that he was aware of the illegal sign stealing but did not do anything to stop it. Hudgens also confirmed that Beltr√°n was one of the leaders in the scheme. Hinch made his first public comments after his firing in February 2020 in a televised interview with Verducci on MLB Network. Hinch said that he had failed as a leader and that he lacked the confidence in 2017 to try to make the players stop. Verducci asked Hinch about the allegations the Astros had changed from the trash can banging to electronic buzzers worn underneath their uniforms that would signal what pitch was coming. Hinch's answer attracted scrutiny because he did not give a firm no, saying instead: \\"We got investigated for three months and the commissioner's office did as thorough an investigation as anyone could imagine was possible. I know he mentioned the emails and the texts and the messages. And I believe him.\\" After the remark was questioned as evasive, Hinch issued a statement a few days later saying, \\"To be clear, I have never seen any such device used in baseball. I am not aware of any such device existing or being utilized with the Astros, the players, or any other team. ... In my interview with Tom, I acknowledged the commissioner‚Äôs report as evidence due to the in- depth nature of the investigation, not as an intended non-answer or a way to elude the question.\\" On February 13, 2020, the Astros held a news conference at their spring training facility in West Palm Beach, Florida, to address the scandal. Bregman said: \\"I am really sorry about the choices that were made by my team, by the organization and by me. I have learned from this and I hope to regain the trust of baseball fans.\\" Altuve said: \\"[I] especially feel remorse for the impact on our fans and the game of baseball.\\" The players were sent back into the clubhouse for a media availability while Crane and new manager Dusty Baker took questions from the media. The press conference was panned by journalists who criticized Crane's answers to questions. After the press conference, the clubhouse was opened to members of the media and players were made available to speak. Correa said: \\"We were wrong for everything we did in 2017. It's not what we stand for. It's not what we want to portray as an organization, and we were definitely wrong about all that and we feel really sorry. We affected careers, we affected the game in some way, and looking back at it, it was just bad.\\" However, Correa vehemently denied reports that Beltr√°n was the ringleader of the scheme and intimidated other players. Bregman said he was embarrassed and pledged to \\"work extremely hard\\" to regain trust. Altuve said: \\"I'm not going to say to you that it was good ‚Äî it was wrong. We feel bad, we feel remorse, like I said, the impact on the fans, the impact on the game ‚Äî we feel bad.\\" Verlander, who was acquired via trade in the middle of the 2017 season, said: \\"I wish I had said more. Looking back, I can't go back, I can't reverse my decision. I wish I had said more, and I didn't, and for that I am sorry.\\" Tony Kemp, who played in seventeen regular season games for the Astros in 2017 after a September call-up, said he was immediately asked if he wanted to participate in the sign stealing scheme but refused. He said, \\"Once I got there in September, the system was already in place, and I just tried to keep my head down and play hard and not really concern myself with it.\\" Dodger Cody Bellinger said that Altuve had stolen the AL Most Valuable Player Award from runner-up Aaron Judge in 2017. Correa responded to Bellinger's comments in an interview with Rosenthal, saying that Altuve did not want anything to do with the sign-stealing scheme: \\"The few times that the trash can was banged was without his consent, and he would go inside the clubhouse and inside the dugout to whoever was banging the trash can and he would get pissed. He would get mad. He would say, 'I don't want this. I can't hit like this. Don't you do that to me.' He played the game clean.\\" Correa also claimed the Astros did not steal signs in the 2017 World Series, and that they did not use the trash can banging in 2018. Ken Giles, the Astros' closer during the 2017 season, claimed that he was unaware of the sign stealing. He was also the second player, after Fiers, to say that he would give back his World Series ring. Giles said: \\"Whatever they ask, I would oblige. Because what was going on at the time was not OK.\\" Collin McHugh, another pitcher on the 2017 Astros, said that he knew about the illegal sign stealing scheme and expressed remorse for going along with it. McHugh said: \\"You've got to be willing to stick up for what you believe in and what you believe is right and what you believe is wrong. And I think a lot of the guys on that team, including myself, are looking back now and wishing we had been as brave in the moment as we thought we were beforehand. To put myself in the shoes of the guys who pitched against us in 2017 and to know that our hitters made that job that much harder that year - it's hard to swallow. And I feel for them and I understand the anger and I understand when people are mad and pissed off.\\" =MLB reactions= While the investigation was ongoing, Molly Knight of The Athletic identified and attempted to contact nine pitchers who were demoted to the minors or designated for assignment immediately after a poor appearance against the Astros in 2017. Four pitchers agreed to be quoted anonymously; three put the blame for their fates on their own performance and a fourth saw the allegations as an explanation for why Astros players seemed to be more comfortable at the plate at home. The other five pitchers either could not be reached or declined to comment. Players publicly commented about the scandal during the offseason. Anger towards the Astros from fellow MLB players grew, especially as the scandal wore on. ESPN's Buster Olney reported that some Astros players had reached out to other players to assure them that they did not cheat, but that some of those friendships were fractured and there was \\"lots of anger\\" towards Astros players after the release of the report. Baseball Hall of Fame member Hank Aaron said the punishments did not fit the crime, adding, \\"I think whoever did that should be out of baseball for the rest of their lives.\\" Pitcher Mike Clevinger said the Astros should be \\"ashamed\\" and, \\"I don't think any of those [expletive] should be able to look us in the eye.\\" Cincinnati Reds pitcher Trevor Bauer was critical of the Astros and gave an eight-minute long answer to a question about the scandal. \\"I'm not going to let them forget the fact that they are hypocrites, they are cheaters, they've stolen from a lot of other people and the game itself,\\" he said. Bauer had publicly accused the Astros of cheating before the scandal broke. Mike Trout, a three-time AL Most Valuable Player, said: \\"It's sad for baseball. It's tough. They cheated. I don't agree with the punishments, the players not getting anything. It was a player-driven thing.\\" Trout said that a few members of the Astros talked to him personally about the scandal, but he said that he \\"lost some respect for some guys\\". Yankees player Aaron Judge said that the Astros should be forced to vacate their title and that the players involved should have been punished. On their 2017 World Series championship, he said: \\"I just don't think it holds any value with me. You cheated and you didn't earn it.\\" On the other hand, retired Hall of Fame pitcher Pedro Mart√≠nez was critical of Fiers for exposing the scheme after he had left the Astros, saying, \\"Whatever happens in the clubhouse stays in the clubhouse and Fiers broke the rules.\\" Jessica Mendoza, an advisor to the Mets and ESPN commentator, also criticized Fiers for going public with his allegations. After being criticized herself for going after Fiers, Mendoza backtracked and said that she wished Fiers had made his allegations privately with MLB. Former MLB player Doug Glanville, in The Athletic, wrote that it was \\"inevitable\\" that an Astros pitcher like Fiers was going to break the scandal because the sign stealing scheme only benefited hitters. According to Glanville: \\"No pitcher, even on a team taking advantage of it, likes technological sign-stealing espionage of this kind, not deep down. Sure, you have teammates you are loyal to, but you are also in a professional order that unites you with other pitchers in the league.\\" Many executives and players at other MLB clubs were unhappy that no players were punished. According to Passan, several executives made their dissatisfaction known in a conference call at which Manfred spelled out the sanctions. One team president told Passan that he believed the scandal was handled in a manner \\"programmed to protect the future of the [Astros] franchise.\\" The Dodgers were the only team to release a statement the week the report was released, only to say that they had been ordered by MLB not to comment on the punishments or \\"any wrongdoing during the 2017 World Series\\". Nationals catcher Kurt Suzuki said he believed the Astros were still cheating in the 2019 World Series: \\"Oh, yeah, no question. We could hear it from their dugout. We heard their whistling. What are you going to do?\\" Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo said after the Astros won the AL pennant in 2019, \\"we got a lot of volunteer phone calls on how to beat them and how to play them.\\" He also expressed frustration that most media attention at the start of 2020 spring training was focused on the Astros and not the reigning world champion Nationals. Olney later said \\"front- office staffers around baseball cannot remember a circumstance of such widespread and loud player-to-player condemnation.\\" Angry comments from players increased when spring training began in February. Many players criticized the Astros, especially after their press conference at the beginning of camp. Many of the condemnations came from members of the Dodgers, who the Astros defeated in the 2017 World Series, and the Yankees, who the Astros defeated in the ALCS in both 2017 and 2019. Catcher Jonathan Lucroy said that he became aware of the Astros' illegal sign stealing in 2018 when new teammate Fiers told him about it. This led Lucroy to create more complicated sign-calling patterns against the Astros. According to Lucroy, \\"Everyone in baseball [knew], especially in that division that played against them. But we were all aware of the Astros doing those things and it was up to us to outsmart them, I guess you could say.\\" Lucroy also said that the Oakland Athletics had told MLB about the Astros but that no investigation was started until Fiers publicly broke the scandal in November 2019. Athletics general manager David Forst also confirmed that Oakland complained to MLB before the investigation. In an interview with ESPN's Karl Ravech which aired on February 16, Manfred defended his decision not to punish any Astros players. He cited longstanding precedent against stripping titles. Additionally, Manfred claimed that had he disciplined any players, the Players Association would have filed a grievance‚Äìone that Manfred believed MLB would have almost certainly lost due to Luhnow's failure to notify the Astros players about the 2017 memorandum. As Manfred put it, the union would have opposed any player suspensions \\"on the basis that we never properly informed them of the rules.\\" He did say, however, that \\"in a perfect world,\\" he would have disciplined players. = Public reactions = The Los Angeles City Council passed a resolution in January 2020 calling on MLB to strip the Astros of the 2017 World Series title and award it to the Dodgers. US Representative Bobby Rush from Illinois released a letter calling on the chairman of the US House Committee on Oversight and Reform to open a congressional investigation into the scandal along with MLB's response. An Astros fan named Tony Adams published data that he collected from watching 58 Astros home games from the 2017 season and listening for banging noises. He found evidence of the trash can banging on 1,143 of 8,274 pitches thrown to Astros hitters, hearing the most instances of banging during the at bats of Springer, Beltr√°n, Bregman, and Marwin Gonz√°lez, and the fewest instances during Altuve's at-bats. A group of Dodgers fans called Pantone 294 purchased over 2,700 tickets to the Los Angeles Angels' home opener on April 3 against the Astros, since the Astros are not scheduled to play the Dodgers in 2020, to jeer the Astros. In February 2020, a writer named Brendan Donley started a Twitter account called the \\"2020 Astros Shame Tour\\" to post about the Astros season. He tweeted videos of Astros players getting hit by pitches and getting heckled by fans. The account quickly gained a large following and has over 188,000 followers as of March 28, 2020. On the Astros' cheating, Donley said: \\"Just the same feeling I had when I was a kid during the steroid era. You feel deceived. You just feel put off. Just make it up to us ‚Äî properly apologize or take the proper punishment. Neither of those two things happened.\\" Polls ESPN conducted a survey of 1,010 adults, including 810 MLB fans, asking about the scandal on January 16 and 17, 2020. Fifty-eight percent of adults said Astros players should have been penalized, and 72 percent of adults said they would support additional steps by MLB to punish players involved in sign stealing. Sixty-one percent of MLB fans said they were closely following the scandal, and 86 percent of MLB fans said the situation was \\"serious\\" (including 57 percent who said it was \\"very serious\\"). Forty- nine percent of adults said the steroid scandal was more serious than the sign stealing scandal, but 44 percent said the sign stealing scandal was worse than Pete Rose gambling on his own team. Seventy-four percent of adults and 76 percent of MLB fans said they believed most teams were using technology to steal signs, but only the Astros and Red Sox were caught. Fifty-four percent of adults said their views of MLB were unchanged by the scandal and 60 percent of adults said the scandals made no difference in their likelihood to watch MLB games. Seton Hall University released a poll of 693 adults about the scandal. Fifty-four percent of respondents said Manfred should have punished the players, with seventeen percent saying he should not have. Forty-nine percent said Manfred's investigation was a \\"cover up\\", compared to 14 percent who said it was a serious effort to punish wrongdoing. Seventy percent of respondents said MLB's handling of the scandal had no effect on their inclination to follow baseball, while seventeen percent said it made them less inclined and seven percent said it made them more inclined. =Lawsuits= Two users of the sports betting website DraftKings, in which MLB is an investor, filed separate lawsuits against MLB, alleging that the league had encouraged fans to bet on games through sponsorship deals with DraftKings while failing to \\"ensure the honesty and integrity of games that served as the basis of [DraftKings] competitions.\\" Mike Bolsinger in 2015 In February 2020, former MLB pitcher Mike Bolsinger filed a lawsuit against the Astros in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleging that the Astros used the banging scheme against him while he was a pitcher for the Toronto Blue Jays in 2017. Bolsinger gave up four runs and got only one out against the Astros on August 4, 2017, and was demoted to the minor leagues after the game and never made it back to the majors. Bolsinger alleges that the Astros changed the course of his career by engaging in unfair business practices, negligence and intentional interference with contractual and economic relations. Bolsinger's suit seeks unspecified damages for him, and he also wants the Astros to forfeit $31 million in bonuses from their 2017 World Series win to charities in Los Angeles and to a fund for retired players seeking financial assistance. In an op-ed for The Washington Post, Bolsinger wrote: \\"The Astros had robbed me of the opportunity to determine my own future on the mound. If I failed at my craft because I wasn't good enough, that would be on me. I could live with that. But thinking about the cheating and the toll it ultimately took on my family ‚Äî that was something I couldn't tolerate.\\" Three lawsuits against the Astros were filed on behalf of current and former season ticket holders in Harris County, Texas, courts in February 2020. Each case alleges the season ticket holders were defrauded by the sign stealing scandal because the play on the field was not what they believed it to be, and the team had raised season ticket prices because of success obtained through sign stealing. A minor league affiliate of the Astros, the Corpus Christi Hooks, revoked the season tickets of Bob Hilliard, an attorney in one of the lawsuits against the Astros a week after it was filed. Subsequent revelations On February 7, 2020, Jared Diamond of The Wall Street Journal published a report of previously undisclosed details uncovered by the MLB investigation, drawn from a letter sent by Manfred to Luhnow on January 2, 2020, that was obtained by the Journal and interviews with sources. According to the article, the sign stealing scandal originated in September 2016 when an intern named Derek Vigoa, who later became the Astros senior manager for team operations, gave Luhnow a PowerPoint presentation on what he called \\"Codebreaker\\", a Microsoft Excel-based program used by front office staff to log and decode opposing catchers signs and then communicate them to baserunners who would relay them to hitters. The report said Codebreaker was enhanced in June 2017 when the trash can scheme was developed. The report also said that Codebreaker was used both at home and on the road and Astros personnel continued to use it into the 2018 season. The sign-stealing operations were referred to as \\"dark arts\\" within the Astros front office. Diamond's report quoted emails from Luhnow and Astros employees who said Luhnow was not only aware of but also enthusiastic about the sign stealing operations, even though he denied knowledge of them to MLB and in public statements. In a subsequent Journal article, Diamond quoted an email sent by an Astros employee named Tom Koch-Weser to his colleagues which read, \\"'I don't want to electronically correspond too much about 'the system' but Cora/Cintr√≥n/Beltr√°n have been driving a culture initiated by Bregman/Vigoa last year and I think it's working,' Koch-Weser wrote. 'I have no proof that it has worked, but we get real good dope on pitchers tipping and being lazy. That information, if it's not already, will eventually yield major results in our favor once players get used to the implementation.'\\" The article also quotes Manfred's January 2 letter to Luhnow as saying, \\"'Most or all Astros players were active participants in the Banging Scheme by the conclusion of the 2017 World Series. ... The Banging Scheme was so prevalent,' Manfred wrote, 'that witnesses regularly describe that everyone in and around the Astros dugout was presumptively aware of it.'\\" In a February press conference, Manfred sarcastically \\"congratulated\\" Diamond, saying, \\"You know, congratulations. You got a private letter that, you know, I sent to a club official. Nice reporting on your part.\\" On February 11, 2020, Rosenthal and Drellich published an article in The Athletic, drawing from interviews of six unnamed members of the 2017 Astros, which portrayed Beltr√°n as the leader of the clubhouse and the ringleader of the electronic sign stealing system. According to the article, \\"small groups of Astros discussed their misgivings\\" with the system, and catcher Brian McCann at one point asked Beltr√°n to stop. One player said, \\"He disregarded it and steamrolled everybody. Where do you go if you're a young, impressionable player with the Astros and this guy says, 'We're doing this'? What do you do?\\" Impact Commissioner's Trophy (1969 edition) The scandal led to scrutiny of the culture of the Astros organization under Crane and Luhnow, which according to Jeremy Venook of The Atlantic had \\"developed a reputation for a cutthroat, win-at-all-costs mentality that sacrificed the human element of the game for marginal gains on the playing field.\\" It also prompted questions about how technology had taken over the game, especially with the introduction of instant replay review in 2014 and all thirty teams installed video rooms to decide whether to challenge calls in real time. Some questioned the leadership of Manfred as Commissioner and his decision not to punish players or sanction Crane. Manfred was heavily criticized by players after a February press conference in which he defended his decision not to discipline Astros players and called the Commissioner's Trophy merely a \\"piece of metal\\" that did not need to be taken away. Manfred said MLB would restrict players' access to video during games beginning in the 2020 season. New Astros manager Dusty Baker, hired to replace Hinch, asked MLB to try to prevent opposing pitchers from throwing beanballs at Astros hitters after some pitchers made explicit or veiled threats; Manfred said a memo would be issued to teams about it. In the first five games of 2020 spring training, seven Astros were hit by pitches from opposing pitchers. Pete Rose, the all- time MLB leader in hits who was banned for life from baseball for gambling on games as a player-manager, applied for reinstatement in the wake of the scandal, arguing that his permanent ban was disproportionately severe compared to the lack of discipline for Astros players.

It was a unique example of the Maserati four-cylinder road-going car clothed in a spyder bodywork. Development The 150 GT was created from a need to replace the A6 lineage of road cars. Chief engineer Giulio Alfieri was responsible for the project made under the Maserati's racing department patronage. The project was aimed to create a sports, road-going car that could be sold in significant numbers to a wealthy customers in an image of Porsche 550 Spyder. 150 GT rear view The creation of the bodywork was entrusted to Medardo Fantuzzi of Carrozzeria Fantuzzi. He was responsible for numerous of Maserati sports racing and grand prix cars. Because Fantuzzi usually realised designs of others, the 150 GT Spyder's lightweight aluminium bodywork was mainly inspired by the work of Pietro Frua, with elements also found on Zagato-bodied Maseratis. The car featured a convertible soft-top with roll-up side windows and was RHD just like the race car it was based on. The 150 GT remained a one-off factory prototype as the production version never materialised. The planned production would be too complex and expensive to bring any profit to the company that already decided to move towards the 3500 GT project. The car remained unsold and was stored in factory for a few years. After the final public demonstration Maserati decided that 150 GT will be sold to the British Maserati agent. In November 1966, it was offered for sale in a Motor Sport magazine for ¬£1,400. In 1993, the 150 GT along with an O.S.C.A were traded to a German collector in exchange for his Aston Martin DB4 GT. After 2006, the car was extensively restored over a three-year period and was later sold by Gooding & Company for US$3 million in 2013. Specifications 150 GT front view The 150 GT sported a slightly detuned engine from the Maserati 150S race car, codenamed 4CF2. It was an Inline-four engine with smaller carburettors and lower compression ratio compared to the original engine. The internal measurements were of bore and stroke to a total capacity of . The resulting power output was at 6800 rpm. The fuel was fed by two double-barrel Weber carburettors. The engine had a DOHC configuration and two spark plugs per cylinder. A new wet sump lubrication system was used for easier road use with an oil pump from the 150S. The chassis was believed to be a modified version sourced from the Maserati 200S race car. After an extensive research by the marque historian Adolfo Orsi, it was determined that the chassis originally belonged to the 1954 Maserati A6GCS and was numbered 2043. That particular A6GCS/53 was entered in the 1954 Mille Miglia. Later, after a couple stages of development, the chassis was used for a prototype Maserati 300S, now restamped as 003, that also spawned an improved version of their developed 150S and 200S tubular frame. It was later reused again to create a sports car prototype, the 150 GT, this time as a serial number 03. The final iteration of the chassis had to be revised to accept the 150S racing engine, a gearbox casing from A6G/2000 road car and 200S prop shaft. The front independent suspension with coil springs and Houdaille hydraulic shock absorbers remained mostly unmodified from their original A6GCS race car specification.

Synopsis It is a common houseplant in temperate climates for its striking variegated leaves and purple underside of its leaves. It can grow outside in a humid tropical climate, but needs light shade in the afternoon and must be protected from high winds. The soil should be kept moist at all times, but never waterlogged as they are susceptible to root rot. The distinctive variegation is lost when the plant is under full shade as the leaves become solid green. Hummingbirds and bees are the main pollinators. Under ideal growing conditions, the Stromanthe will reach between 4-6 feet tall in about a year after emerging from its rhizome. Propagation can be from either seeds or rhizome division, but it is fastest and more reliable to take rhizome cuttings.

Begun in the sixteenth century and completed in the late nineteenth century, it has been deemed ‚Äúthe greatest engineering project of colonial Spanish America.\\"Cope, R. Douglas, \\"Desag√ºe\\", Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 2, p. 368. Historian Charles Gibson goes further and considers it ‚Äúone of the largest engineering enterprises of pre- industrial society anywhere in the world.‚ÄùGibson, Charles. The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1964, p. 6. There had been periodic flooding of the prehispanic Aztec capital of Tenochitlan, the site which became the Spanish capital of Mexico City. Flooding continued to be a threat to the viceregal capital, so at the start of the seventeenth century, the crown ordered a solution to the problem that entailed the employment of massive numbers of indigenous laborers who were compelled to work on the drainage project. The crown also devoted significant funding. A tunnel and later a surface drainage system diverted flood waters outside the closed basin of Mexico. Not until the late nineteenth century under Porfirio D√≠az (1876-1911) was the project completed by British entrepreneur and engineer, Weetman Pearson, using machinery imported from Great Britain and other technology at a cost of 16 million pesos, a vast sum at the time. The ecological impact was long lasting, with desiccation permanently changing the ecology of the Basin of Mexico.  Early history  In the period before the Spanish conquest, the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had been subject to flooding during prolonged rains. There was no natural drainage of the lake system outside the closed basin. In the late 1440s, the ruler of Tenochtitlan, Moctezuma I, and the ruler of the allied kingdom of Texcoco, Nezahualcoyotl, ordered a dike (albarrad√≥n) to be constructed, which was expanded under the rule of Ahuitzotl. The dike was in place when the Spanish conquered Tenochtitlan in 1521, but major flooding in 1555-56 prompted the construction of a second dike. The Spanish made plans for diverting flood waters following that flooding, but took no action. Post-conquest damage to the surrounding watershed by the cutting of trees and the silting of the lake likely exacerbated the existing tendencies toward flooding. Flooding in 1604 and 1607 damaged buildings in the capital and crown officials took steps to devote capital and labor into solving the problem. Since forced indigenous labor was a resource that the crown could draw on, thousands of indigenous men were put to work digging a tunnel to divert flood waters. The operation was similar to mining work. The crown also engaged a Dutch engineer, Adrian Boot, to assess the problem. The Netherlands were part of the Spanish Hapsburg Empire, so it is not surprising that a Dutch expertise was brought to bear. Boot recommended reverting to a dike to control flooding. Work was begun on one, but huge rains in 1628 overtook the project. Mexico City was in crisis. Food was scarce. Most of the population fled, and buildings collapsed. The crown even proposed moving the capital to the mainland. The tunnel was converted to an open cut trench. In the decade of the greatest crisis, the crown $1.5 million pesos on the Desag√ºe, with the labor of an untold number of indigenous workers, but certainly numbering in the tens of thousands. The crown put an end to coerced agricultural labor, but continued with compulsory labor for the Desag√ºe.Gibson, Aztecs Under Spanish Rule, pp. 236-242. A section of the colonial archives in Mexico City are devoted to the documentation on the Desag√ºe.  Nineteenth and twentieth centuries  With Mexican independence from Spain in 1821, the Mexican state ended compulsory indigenous labors. The need for maintenance of the Desag√ºe open cut drainage continued in the post- independence era. With political stability achieved under President Porfirio D√≠az, the Desag√ºe became a centerpiece of Mexico's drive for modernity. It was inaugurated with great fanfare in 1900, touted as one of the great achievements of the modern era in Mexico. With Mexico City's location at the low point of the basin of Mexico, drainage of rainwater, industrial waste from tanneries and abattoirs, and human sewage concentrated there. Awareness that such pollution posed a risk and was a major impediment to Mexico's project of modernization, the daunting task was to find a solution. Although flood waters had long been a physical threat to the capital, in the late nineteenth century, they were also now seen as a threat to urban sanitation and public health. Infant mortality was high as was general mortality in the capital when the government tackled anew the drainage project. Initially a network of dikes and holding tanks was tried hold back excess water was tried, but was unsuccessful. Work during the colonial era was by manpower wielding hand tools of shovels and pickaxes, and progress was limited due to the high water table that quickly filled the drainage ditch. Much of Mexican modernization during the Porfiriato relied on foreign expertise and capital. British entrepreneur Weetman Pearson, instrumental in developing Mexico's petroleum industry, imported British-made machinery that was assembled in Mexico. Mechanization of digging overcame previous limitations. The project saw the construction of a deep and straight trench in the basin of Mexico and construction of a tunnel through the eastern mountains. A massive dredge 40 meters long, made of timbers and booms, with a steam engine mounted on the deck was used. The machinery had 40 buckets in a line to dredge sludge from the bottom of the cut, raised it to the surface, and then discharge it into train cars to be deposited elsewhere. The surface cut was 47 kilometers long, with the tunnel through the mountains another 10 kilometers.Miller, Shawn William, An Environmental History of Latin America.

It is dedicated to cataloguing, restoring and preserving the documents and photographs of African American women. The collection work began in 1935 and was formalized into the National Archives for Black Women's History in 1978. Originally housed at 1318 Vermont Avenue, Washington, D.C. in the carriage house of the former home of Mary McLeod Bethune, which is now a National Historic Site, the archive was controversially moved in 2014 by the National Park Service citing concerns over the inadequacy of the original site for preservation of its collection. History In August 1935, Mary Ritter Beard, one of the co-founders of the World Center for Women's Archives, wrote to Dorothy B. Porter, librarian and curator at Howard University to solicit her help in gathering archival materials on African American women for preservation. Other black women Beard recruited to help with the project included Mary McLeod Bethune, who would found of the National Council of Negro Women on 5 December 1935; two prior presidents of the National Association of Colored Women, Elizabeth Carter Brooks and Mary Church Terrell; and Sue Bailey Thurman, an author, lecturer and historian. Because the Washington, D. C. branch of the World Center for Women's Archives would not allow the black women to join, Beard worked directly with the black women's committee to collect and preserve their archives. The first chair of the committee, Porter, also recruited Juanita Mitchell, the first black woman lawyer in Maryland to serve with the other women on the committee. The first exhibit of collected materials was hosted in December 1939 in Washington, D. C. in conjunction with Beard and the World Center for Women's Archives. Though she proposed that the committee collect archival material for an exhibit for the American Negro Exposition to be hosted the following year in Chicago, the Women's Archives dissolved in 1940, and the committee continued on its own. Bethune proposed that they begin work to acquire a building that could serve as both the headquarters of the National Council of Negro Women and an archive of black women's history. The committee raised funds for the exhibit and produced it on their own. That same year, Thurmon founded the Aframerican Women's Journal and used the journal as a platform to raise awareness for the archives and ask for women to submit their documents. In 1942, Porter resigned from the committee because of increasing demands of her time from the Moorland Foundation. Thurman became chair in 1944, and in 1945 began a funding drive to raise money for collecting records and acquiring a property. In 1946, the committee organized a National Archives Day, publicizing the event with churches, libraries and other organizations in Washington, D.C. The Fall 1946 issue of Aframerican carried a full-page article soliciting archival materials and that same year a radio script which recorded the history of Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman and Phyllis Wheatly was created by the archives committee. It aired on WWDC radio, as On This We Stand, the following June. In 1949, Thurman met with reporters from the Chicago Courier and Chicago Defender to help them promote the work of the National Archives, and Museum Department of the National Council of Negro Women. Throughout the 1950s, the committee continued to solicit archival materials and hosted an exhibit featuring historic dolls made by sculptor, Meta Warrick Fuller, and a quilt depicting Harriet Tubman. In 1958, the committee solicited recipes from black women to publish a different kind of history‚Äîone that celebrated the collective works that characterized their community. Thurman compiled the recipes and published The Historical Cookbook of the American Negro, which not only gave recipes but included narratives on black history. It retold stories of professional women throughout history aimed at countering the belief that all black women were maids and domestics. In the 1960s through the mid-1970s, work on the archive waned as the emphasis shifted to the Civil Rights Movement, but 1976 as part of the United States Bicentennial celebrations, Senator John Warner, assisted in getting an appropriation from Congress to renovate the property where Bethune had last lived, located at 1318 Vermont Avenue, Washington, D.C. The following year, Bettye Collier-Thomas, director of Temple University's Center for African American History and Culture, established the Bethune Museum in the property and began converting the carriage house into a facility to house the National Archives for Black Women's History. In 1978, the push to reignite the archival effort resumed, and using fund from a grant received from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission, the archives opened to researchers in November 1979. Linda J. Henry of the Schlesinger Library at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study organized the archive. In 1982, the Bethune House was designated as a National Historic Site, allowing the facility to access federal funding. Nearly a decade later, in 1991, the National Park Service acquired the property. In 2014, the Park Service made a controversial decision to move the archive from the Bethune property citing concerns about the preservation of records at the facility. They were relocated to the National Park Service Museum Resource Center located at 3300 Hubbard Road in Landover, Maryland. Collections The archives are open by appointment only. A major portion of the archival records is the collection of corporate documents relating to the National Council of Negro Women, its various branches, the museum and the house. Other collections include the papers of Mayme G.

The first act was committed in 1994 at Sprockh√∂vel, with the last rape assigned to him occurring in December 2002.  Assaults and perpetrator profile  The Phantom's first victim was a 12-year-old student from Sprockh√∂vel. She was raped on January 7, 1994 at 1:10 PM, on her way home from in school in a wooded area. In September 1994, the perpetrator struck for the second time in Sprockh√∂vel, sexually abusing a 44-year-old. He continued with the assaults around the area until June 1996, when he attacked in Bochum for the first time. From then on, the preyed mostly on young women in the vicinity of the Ruhr University Bochum, continuing until 2002. In 2003, another victim of the rapist came forward, with her assault occurring in August 2001. All of the rapes were determined to have been committed by the same perpetrator, after DNA analysis of semen traces. The detailed police investigations have led to various findings over the years. Early sketches of the Phantom showed the culprit as a middle-aged man, slim and with a mustache. He committed all his acts while disguised, dressed in all black and with a baseball cap. The police assumed based on statements that the offender likely has good local knowledge of the Sprockh√∂vel area. It's assumed that he lives or lived there, and could possibly have family ties. All of the crime scenes were in the area of public transport stops, where the Phantom may have met his victims. He chose young women as victims, as they usually have a different recreational behavior than older women, and also use public transport at night. In the vicinity of the university, there were many student residences, and thus, many young women - this is considered the main reason for the Phantom relocating from Sprockh√∂vel to Bochum. He used a knife to threaten his victims. Strikingly, there were intervals between the rapes - it never passed more than half a year before the next rape. The first series can be limited to the period of 1994 to 1997, with the last assault being committed on November 18, 1997. Subsequently, he struck again after almost three years, in the summer of 2000. Another assault followed in August 2000, before he paused yet again. The next known case is dated from August 2001, with another rape series taking place between summer and December 2002. On December 1, 2002, he committed his last known rape. Since then, the Phantom has not struck again, leaving many questions unanswered.  Investigation of the Messer Commission  The serial offender, baptized \\"The Uni-Phantom\\" by the press, was the subject of a large-scale manhunt by the Bochum police. After his last assault in 2002, in Bochum, up to 40 civil servants spent months working on potential crime scenes. The investiationg Messer Commission (shortened to EK Messer) included at times up to 20 officers, including a profiler from Scotland Yard. Students and employees of the Ruhr University, as well as men from Sprockh√∂vel and Bochum were asked for saliva samples, a strongly criticized move, especially by some students. A law student who refused such a sample appealed to the Federal Constitutional Court, but in vain. Despite this, the 10,000 samples collected by the profilers proved unsuccessful. The Bochum police turned the course of investigative work to work with the ZDF, and a review of the rape series was broadcast as part of the Aktenzeichen XY ‚Ä¶ ungel√∂st programme. Even after many years, evidence still reaches the police in Bochum, with the investigation still persisting.

The church remains an active parish church and is a Grade I listed building. History Historic England gives a construction date for the church of the 14th century, with further work in the fifteenth and a major Victorian restoration in 1852. Pevsner suggests that the interior contains the oldest built elements, dating the arcades to the late 13th century. The \\"lavish two-storeyed porch\\" was constructed by Richard Howard, Sheriff of Norwich, and dates from 1488. The tower is of the 14th century, a rare example of its type surviving from the Middle Ages. In the 19th century, the Rev. Edmund Yates undertook a \\"drastic(‚Ä¶.)\\" restoration, particularly of the interior. The traditional box pews were replaced with seating for over 700 and the galleries were removed. The landscape gardener Humphry Repton is buried in the churchyard and is commemorated with a memorial located outside of the chancel door. Pevsner notes that the construction date of the monument \\"must be considerably later than that of Repton's death\\". Repton, born in the neighbouring county of Suffolk in 1752, had purchased a small county estate at Sustead, near Aylsham in 1778 and many of his earliest commissions were from local Norfolk landowners. The churchyard also contains a \\"very rare\\" mortsafe, an iron grille placed over a grave to prevent body snatching. St Michael's remains an active parish church in the Aylsham and District ministry and regular services are held. Reorganisation of the interior of the church in the later 20th century has enabled the holding of concerts, exhibitions and a produce market. The church also hosts a local choir. The Aylsham Heritage Centre, a museum of local history, is located in the former church hall in the grounds. Architecture and description The writer A. C. Benson, author of the words to \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\", described St Michael's during a visit in 1902; \\"(it) is long and low, a large grey flint building, low-pitched roof-transepts and aisles, with a very fine tower\\". The construction is of flint, sometimes knapped, with rubble infilling. The church is a Grade I listed building.

They are now part of the Lithuanian school curriculum and have been translated into English and German. Biography She was born in Kaunas and studied at the local girls' gymnasium. After the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, the family was exiled in the first wave of deportations that took place in June 1941. Dalia's father was separated from the rest of the family and died in the Urals. Dalia, her mother, and her brother were first sent to the Altai region and then transported to Trofimovsk (), a prison island in the Lena River delta far beyond the Arctic Circle. Many of the deportees died of cold and starvation. In 1949, together with her mother, she managed to escape and returned to Lithuania, hiding out in the homes of friends and relatives in Kaunas for a year. Her mother died and was buried while still in hiding. Dalia was rearrested and sent to Unzhlag camp in Sukhobezvodnoye in the Gorky Oblast. In 1953, she was once again exiled to Yakutia but the following year, as conditions eased following the death of Stalin, she gained the right to study medicine at Omsk. Returning once more to Kaunas, she continued her medical education there, graduating in 1960 (at the age of 33) from the local medical school. She went to work as a doctor in Laukuva in the ≈†ilalƒó District. She worked until 1974, when she was dismissed from her job by the Soviet authorities and even deprived of her service apartment.

He is an infant member of the same unnamed alien species as the Star Wars character Yoda, with whom he shares a strong ability in the Force. In the series, the protagonist known as \\"The Mandalorian\\" is hired to track down and capture the Child for a remnant of the fallen Galactic Empire, but instead becomes his adoptive father and protects him from the Imperials. The Child and the Mandalorian are the only characters who have appeared in every episode of the series. He was created by The Mandalorian creator and showrunner Jon Favreau based upon his desire to explore the mystery around Yoda and his species. The character was further developed in early conversations between Favreau and executive producer Dave Filoni, and the character's imagery was defined by concept artist Christian Alzmann. The Child is mostly a work of animatronics and puppetry, although accentuated with computer-generated imagery. The puppet was designed by Legacy Effects and cost about $5 million to make. It is controlled by two technicians, one who operates the eyes and mouth and another who controls other facial expressions. The character's voice and sounds were created using a combination of adult and infant vocals, as well as recordings of a bat-eared fox and kinkajou. The dynamic between the Mandalorian and the Child embody a theme of parenting and fatherhood prevalent in The Mandalorian, and the Child character has also raised questions about good and evil and nature versus nurture in the show. The Child has received a positive reception from fans and reviewers, is widely considered the show's breakout character, and quickly became a popular Internet meme. The Guardian called him \\"2019's biggest new character\\", and The Hollywood Reporter has said the character \\"represents the future of Hollywood\\". Many writers have described the Child as a key part in the success of Disney+. The Child was kept secret and was deliberately withheld from The Mandalorians prerelease marketing and merchandise plans to avoid leaks before the show aired. As a result, merchandise of the Child was not immediately available after the show debuted, which some analysts say cost Disney $2.7 million in revenue, but Bob Iger, Disney's CEO at the time of The Mandalorians premiere, has defended the strategy. Appearances The Child is a member of the same alien species as the Star Wars character Yoda. He is 50 years old during the events of The Mandalorian, but still appears to be an infant because of the pace at which that species ages. The species has never been given a proper name because Star Wars creator George Lucas wanted Yoda to maintain a sense of mystery. As of the end of Season 1 of The Mandalorian, the Child has not been identified by a proper name, being referred to by other characters as \\"the child\\", \\"the kid\\", or \\"the baby\\". He is the only character to appear in all eight episodes of the series other than the titular Mandalorian bounty hunter character, \\"The Mandalorian\\" (Pedro Pascal). The Child first appears in the series debut, \\"Chapter 1: The Mandalorian\\", when the Mandalorian accepts a valuable commission from a mysterious man known only as \\"The Client\\" (Werner Herzog), who works for a remnant of the now-fallen Galactic Empire. The assignment is to track down and capture an unidentified fifty-year-old target. The Mandalorian and a fellow bounty hunter droid IG-11 (Taika Waititi) infiltrate a remote and heavily-defended encampment on the planet Arvala-7 and find the Child. When IG-11 attempts to kill the child, the Mandalorian protects him and instead shoots and destroys IG-11. In \\"Chapter 2: The Child\\", the Child is present when the Mandalorian is attacked by a giant rhinoceros-like creature called a Mudhorn. As the beast rushes toward the Mandalorian for the kill, the Child uses the Force to levitate the mudhorn, allowing a surprised Mandalorian to kill it. The Mandalorian delivers the Child to the Client on the planet Nevarro and collects his bounty in \\"Chapter 3: The Sin\\", after which the Client orders his colleague, Dr. Pershing (Omid Abtahi), to \\"extract the necessary material\\" from the Child. The Mandalorian later has second thoughts and returns to the Imperial compound to rescue the Child, killing multiple stormtroopers. This violates the code of the Bounty Hunters' Guild, and a group of bounty hunters led by guild leader Greef Karga (Carl Weathers) ambush the Mandalorian and attempt to take the Child back from him. The Mandalorian and the Child are saved when fellow warriors from the Mandalorian's tribe come out of hiding to defend them, allowing them to escape Nevarro. In \\"Chapter 4: Sanctuary\\", the Mandalorian seeks refuge in the sparsely populated planet Sorgan. He plans to leave the Child in a village there under the care of a widow named Omera (Julia Jones), but after another bounty hunter tracks them down, he realizes the planet is not safe. The Mandalorian and the Child visit the planet Tatooine in \\"Chapter 5: The Gunslinger\\", during which the Mandalorian leaves the Child in the care of a mechanic named Peli Motto (Amy Sedaris). The Child and Peli are briefly abducted by a bounty hunter named Toro Calican (Jake Cannavale), whom the Mandalorian kills. In \\"Chapter 6: The Prisoner\\", the Mandalorian participates in a rescue job as part of a team of mercenaries organized by Ranzar Malk (Mark Boone Junior). The Mandalorian keeps the Child hidden on his ship during the mission, but the other mercenaries eventually find him. One of them, a droid named Q9-0 (Richard Ayoade), learns of the bounty on the Child and tries to kill him, but is himself destroyed by the Mandalorian. At the start of the first season's penultimate episode, \\"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\\", the Mandalorian is contacted by Greef Karga, who says the Client has tightened his control over Nevarro as a result of the Mandalorian's actions there. Greef proposes that the Mandalorian help him kill the Client and eliminate the Imperial presence from the planet, and in exchange he and the Child will be safe from any further reprisals from the Guild. The proposal is a trap, and Greef plans to ambush and kill the Mandalorian and return the Child to the Client. Nevertheless, the Mandalorian accepts the offer and returns to the planet along with the Child and his allies Cara Dune (Gina Carano), Kuiil (Nick Nolte), and the recently-rebuilt IG-11, whom Kuiil has reprogrammed to be a nurse droid and protector for the Child. During their voyage, the party is attacked by pterodactyl-like creatures and Greef receives what would have been a fatal injury, but the Child uses the Force to heal him. Greef is so moved that he has a change of heart and informs the others about the trap. They devise a new plan in which Kuiil will bring the Child back to the Mandalorian's ship, while the others will kill the Client and his troops. The plan goes wrong and Kuiil is killed by Imperial Scout Troopers, who briefly abduct the Child before he is rescued by IG-11 at the start of the first- season finale, \\"Chapter 8: Redemption\\". IG-11 brings the Child back to the Mandalorian, Cara, and Greef and helps defend them against an ambush by the Imperial leader Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito), who is revealed to have been seeking the Child all along. He does not reveal why he wants the Child, but says he \\"means more to me than you will ever know\\". After surviving an attack by Gideon's stormtroopers, during which the Child uses the Force to deflect the fire of an attacking stormtrooper's flamethrower back against him, the group escapes with the Child through a sewer grate. They seek help from the hidden Mandalorian tribe, but it is revealed the Imperials wiped out the tribe after they revealed themselves in \\"Chapter 3: The Sin\\". The tribe's leader, \\"The Armorer\\" (Emily Swallow), instructs the Mandalorian to watch over and protect the Child, who she formally adopts into the Mandalorian culture as a \\"foundling\\", like the Mandalorian once was himself. She instructs the Mandalorian to seek out and deliver the Child to the others of his kind, and that until this occurs, the Mandalorian and the Child are a \\"clan of two\\", and that the Mandalorian will be like a father to him. She declares their \\"signet\\" to be a likeness of a Mudhorn, the creature the Mandalorian and the Child worked together to kill in \\"Chapter 2: The Child\\". The group departs, and IG-11 sacrifices himself to destroy an entire squad of stormtroopers to protect the Child. After fending off a final attack from Moff Gideon, the Mandalorian once again departs from Nevarro with the Child. Characterization Physically, the Child closely resembles Yoda, sharing his signature green skin and long, pointed ears. The Child is small in size, with wide eyes, short hairs, and wrinkled skin. The Child is capable of sitting up, crawling, walking and eating. He appears capable of understanding some language spoken around him, but cannot speak except in baby-like babble noises. Gina Carano feels the Child brings a warmth to a series that acts as a counterbalance to the Mandalorian himself, who otherwise acts aloof and unemotional. Carano believes in this way, the Child \\"raises the emotional level and the stakes\\" of the series. Anthony Breznican of Vanity Fair echoed this sentiment: \\"There is an emotional transference happening here. The audience cares more about the unnamed, faceless Mandalorian because he cares so much about Baby Yoda.\\" Rebecca Keegan of The Hollywood Reporter believes the Child displays a form of wisdom despite his young age, describing him as \\"a Dalai Lama in toddler form\\". Jeanne Cavelos, former NASA astrophysicist and author of The Science of Star Wars, also believes the Child demonstrates intelligence beyond his years, noting his awareness and empathy toward beings even when their faces or bodies are covered completely, as well as his ability to recognize injury in others and attempt to repair it. Despite his youth, the Child demonstrates a considerable ability to use and manipulate the Force, such as when he lifts the large Mudhorn creature into the air in \\"Chapter 2: The Child\\", and when he deflected the fire of an attacking stormtrooper's flamethrower back against him in \\"Chapter 8: Redemption\\". Kevin Melrose of Comic Book Resources noted that in the original Star Wars trilogy film The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Luke Skywalker struggled to lift an X-wing fighter due to its large size, so the fact that the Child can lift heavy objects despite his diminutive size and young age demonstrates the vastness of his Force powers. The Child also repeatedly shows a desire to use the Force to help those around him, such as when he attempts to heal the Mandalorian's wounds in \\"Chapter 2: The Child\\", and when he heals Greef Karga's near-fatal wounds in \\"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\\". However, after using the Force in this manner, the Child is often exhausted and slips into unconsciousness, indicating that the Child is still developing his power and does not yet have the skills to fully control it. Despite his raw natural ability with the Force, the Child is untrained and still depends heavily on the assistance of the Mandalorian and other allies for protection. The Child has a sweet temperament, and comes across as innocent and kindhearted to most of the people he encounters, but is also occasionally capable of violence, such as during a scene in \\"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\\" when he uses the Force to choke Cara Dune while she is engaging the Mandalorian in a friendly arm wrestling match. Concept and creation =Conception= The Child was conceived by Jon Favreau, the creator and showrunner of The Mandalorian. Upon learning that Lucasfilm had been sold to the Walt Disney Company in 2012, Favreau began imagining working on a Star Wars project, and was particularly interested in exploring the events after the original Star Wars trilogy. He conceived the Child based upon a desire to explore the mystery around Yoda and his species, and an interest in presenting a character from Yoda's species at the beginning of his journey, in contrast to Yoda ending his own journey in Return of the Jedi (1983). Favreau believed part of the appeal of Yoda was that George Lucas deliberately kept his origins and details about the species mysterious, and Favreau believed that sense of mystery would extend to the Child: \\"I think that's why people are so curious about this little one of the same species.\\" In mid-2017, shortly after Favreau pitched The Mandalorian to Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy, she suggested he meet with Dave Filoni, who had co-created several Star Wars animated series. The character of the Child was further developed in early conversations between Favreau and Filoni, the latter of whom drew a rough sketch of the character on cocktail napkins during the talks. Multiple artists worked to refine the image of the Child created by Filoni, but the definitive imagery came from a concept drawing by artist Christian Alzmann, which depicted the character's makeshift garment. Favreau said of this rendering: \\"It looked cute, but it also looked a little weird. That's part of Yoda. It can't just be cute. It can't just be a straight-up Disney baby, it has to be a little bit tweaked.\\" The team sought to establish mannerisms and expressions for the Child that would remind viewers of a pet with whom they might share a connection. These characteristics include the Child's ears, posture, and the way he cocks his head. Disney CEO Bob Iger said of the Child: \\"The moment I laid eyes on the character, I had a strong feeling that it was going to connect with audiences. So cute, so interesting, so compelling. So familiar and yet so new.\\" Favreau has clarified that the Child is not a younger version of Yoda himself, but has declined to comment upon whether he is related to Yoda or otherwise connected to him. Both Iger and Carl Weathers, the actor who portrays Greef Karga, have said the Child has a proper name that has not yet been revealed, and they have not disclosed it. =Development= The Child is mostly a work of animatronics and puppetry, although accentuated with computer-generated imagery (CGI). Legacy Effects, the special effects studio started by prot√©g√©s of special make-up effects creator Stan Winston, designed the Child puppet and supplied the puppeteers to animate it during filming. The puppet cost about $5 million to make, and is relatively heavy due to the amount of wires and animatronic technology inside it. It is controlled by two technicians, one who operates the eyes and mouth and another who controls other facial expressions. There are several stand-in versions for the Child used in filming in addition to the primary puppet. The crew of The Mandalorian wanted to use animatronics for the Child as often as possible. However, they also shot versions of the character's scenes both with and without the puppet, so they had the option of replacing it with a CGI effect in post-production if the puppet did not look satisfactory. When CGI is used, Favreau said they try to make the character obey the same physical laws that he would if he were a puppet, adding: \\"I think a lot of times CG makes itself too obvious where you don't create parameters creatively that allow the character to keep the same identity and charm.\\" The voice and sounds of the Child were created by David Acord and Matthew Wood, sound editors with Skywalker Sound, who had previously worked on various Star Wars projects. Acord recorded animals' noises at a wildlife rescue near San Diego, and used recordings of a bat-eared fox and kinkajou to make the initial version of the Child's voice. However, Favreau suggested the voice needed to sound more human-like and relatable to audiences, so instead the animal sounds were scaled back and used only for small grunts and cooing noises. Actual infant vocals were used to create the new version of the Child's voice, and Acord used a highly-pitched version of his own voice for some of the more articulated vocalizations. Acord also previously voiced Rotta the Hutt, the young Huttlet son of Jabba the Hutt, in the animated film Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008). =Filming= The character was referred to as \\"The Child\\" in screenplays for The Mandalorian, though Bryce Dallas Howard, who directed \\"Chapter 4: Sanctuary\\", said she always referred to him on set simply as \\"Baby\\", and other cast members called it \\"The Being\\". During filming, the director of each episode would communicate with the Child's puppeteers to discuss what was happening in the scene, what emotions the Child should express, and what actions the character should take. Director Deborah Chow said in this way, it was similar to providing direction to a living actor. Favreau encouraged the directors to test and push the boundaries of the Child puppet during filming, urging them to experiment and attempt to get the most realistic movements and mannerisms possible from the character. Brendan Wayne, a body double for the Mandalorian character, said the puppet looked so realistic that performing against it felt like working with an actual child actor. Rick Famuyiwa, the director of \\"Chapter 2: The Child\\", said he was shocked when he learned that the premiere episode of The Mandalorian ended with the introduction of the Child, because it meant he would be directing the next episode that further expanded upon the character. The Child puppet was popular among the cast and crew on the set of The Mandalorian. Chow said: \\"With the baby, every time it came on set, the whole crew would respond to it. Even the grip department, every production assistant is coming to the monitors, trying to see it.\\" Howard screamed in excitement when she first saw it, and Gina Carano said of the Child: \\"That was our precious. Our precious is this being that we all end up taking care of in some way.\\" Emily Swallow said she \\"fell in love with it like everybody else\\", adding: \\"I was thrilled when they brought him in that little bag for the scene that I got to have with it. I just wanted to snuggle it.\\" Amy Sedaris said the animatronic Child puppet made everyone on the set happy: \\"The minute you looked into Baby Yoda's eyes you just got lost.\\" Likewise, Giancarlo Esposito said he enjoyed interacting with the Child puppet during filming: \\"It melts my heart, because the reality is, this little baby does things that you could never imagine and when you look at those eyes and that little body, how can you not help but fall in love?\\" Carl Weathers has said of him: \\"He is very interesting and very knowledgeable and very cute. I never use that word, but he is a cute little guy.\\" Werner Herzog, who portrays The Client in The Mandalorian, strongly urged the show's producers to remain committed to the animatronics and puppetry for the Child, calling them \\"cowards\\" for considering using computer- generated imagery. Werner Herzog particularly enjoyed filming scenes with the animatronic Child puppet, which he called \\"heartbreakingly beautiful\\". Chow said directing the scene between Herzog and the Child in \\"Chapter 3: The Sin\\" was \\"one of the weirdest\\" moments of her career, because he had so much affection for the puppet and was interacting with it like it was a living being. She said: \\"I literally think that he had forgotten that it's not a real-live creature and he had fallen in love with it.\\" Herzog strongly urged the Mandalorian filmmakers to use the puppet for the character and not CGI. While filming one scene, Dave Filoni began to remove the puppet to shoot an alternate take, in case they decided to use a CGI version of the Child in its place. Herzog passionately urged him not to do so and to remain committed to the animatronics and puppetry, saying: \\"You are cowards. Leave it. Leave it.\\" Esposito has also said having an actual Child puppet to perform against has been beneficial for the cast, because \\"that space allows all of us to be so wowed by its presence\\". Misty Rosas, who delivered the motion capture performance for Kuiil, often held the Child puppet during her scenes in \\"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\\". This occasionally proved challenging for Rosas, who also had to manage the weight of the animatronics in her own costume and face mask, as well as the weight of the Child prop. One full day of filming the episode focused upon Kuiil riding the blurrg creature, a process Rosas described as \\"intense\\" due to the amount of time she spent on the fake creature and the speeds at which it was made to run. The process was made further challenging because she was carrying the heavy animatronic Child puppet throughout the scenes, and she occasionally needed breaks between takes. Rosas said: \\"My legs are not exactly long, so I was squeezing for dear life and holding the baby.\\" Nevertheless, Rosas said she enjoyed working with the Child character, saying: \\"He just melts my heart, he's so cute.\\" During the opening scene of \\"Chapter 8: Redemption\\", an Imperial Scout Trooper portrayed by comedian Adam Pally punched the Child. During the first take of filming the scene, Pally punched the animatronic Child puppet hard, prompting Favreau to inform the actor that the puppet costs about $5 million to make. This made Pally so nervous that he missed the Child altogether when he tried to punch him in the three subsequent takes. Pally joked about working with the Child: \\"I gotta tell you, the truth is that Baby Yoda is a bit of a diva. He's constantly vaping.\\" At some point during filming of The Mandalorian, George Lucas visited the set and held the Child puppet. Favreau posted a picture of Lucas holding the Child on Instagram on January 16, 2020, which drew considerable Internet attention. =Prerelease= Jon Favreau has credited actor Donald Glover (pictured) with inspiring the decision to keep the Child's revelation a secret. The Child was kept secret and was deliberately withheld from The Mandalorian prerelease marketing and merchandise plans due to the risk that details about the character could leak before the show aired. Favreau said of this plan: \\"I think that part of what people really value is to be surprised and delighted, and I think that's becoming all too rare.\\" Favreau has credited Donald Glover as the source of that strategy. While developing The Mandalorian, Favreau was simultaneously directing Glover in the photorealistic remake of The Lion King (2019). While discussing music and pop culture, Glover told Favreau that people enjoy being surprised, because true surprises had become much less common in the Internet era. As an example, Glover cited the excitement generated by the sudden releases of surprise albums by singer and songwriter Beyonc√©. Favreau felt keeping the Child a secret until he was revealed would allow fans to connect with the character and \\"discover the story as it was unfolding\\". The leadership and marketing team at the Walt Disney Company was supportive of this strategy. Screeners of the pilot episode were not distributed to reviewers to avoid leaks about the Child, and the official Lucasfilm and Star Wars social media accounts did not start posting messages about the Child until about a week after the series debuted, to avoid spoiling the character's debut as much as possible. Themes =Parenting and fatherhood= One of the primary themes of The Mandalorian is parenting and fatherhood, particularly through the father-son relationship dynamic between the Mandalorian and the Child. Ryan Britt of Fatherly wrote: \\"For years the Star Wars franchise avoided depicting a parent- child dynamic. With Mando and Baby Yoda, that‚Äôs finally changing.\\" Vulture writer Kathryn VanArendonk argued that parenting has been the subject of past Star Wars stories, but almost always during later stages of parenthood, rather than an infant in early developmental stages such as the Child. As examples, she cited Obi-Wan Kenobi serving as a mentor to the adolescent Anakin Skywalker, Princess Leia lamenting over her grown son Kylo Ren, or the absence of Rey's parents. Several reviewers have compared the dynamic between the Child and the Mandalorian to Lone Wolf and Cub, a manga about a samurai warrior and his young son. The Child makes the Mandalorian a softer and more relatable character; he changes in a positive way because of raising the Child, becoming less selfish and self-absorbed. Several examples of the Mandalorian parenting the Child appear throughout the series, such as when he stops the Child from pressing random buttons in the cockpit of the Mandalorian's spaceship, ultimately by holding him in his lap. In another example, the Mandalorian sets up a car seat for the Child in the cockpit of his ship, so he can be seated safely and comfortably during their travels. The relationship between the Mandalorian and the Child is an example of unexpected fatherhood. The Mandalorian feels a connection and parental bond with the Child because of his own childhood, when he was orphaned upon the death of his parents and was adopted by the Mandalorian culture as a \\"foundling\\". Nevertheless, fatherhood was not a role the Mandalorian was initially seeking, and he makes repeated initial attempts to avoid this responsibility. He first does so in \\"Chapter 3: The Sin\\", when he leaves the Child with the Client, and then again in \\"Chapter 4\\" Sanctuary\\", when he plans to leave the Child with Omera, a protective mother on the planet Sorgan who is willing to take the Child into her own family. The Mandalorian does not fully commit to the role of fatherhood until the first season finale, \\"Chapter 8: Redemption\\", when the Child himself is also adopted into the Mandalorian culture as a \\"foundling\\" and the Mandalorian is formally declared to be his father figure. Anthony Breznican of Vanity Fair has noted that none of the day-to-day difficulties of parenthood are portrayed in the series: \\"There is no shrill squawking from Baby Yoda, no tantrum, no spit-up, no uncontrollable shrieking that burrows into a parent‚Äôs psyche like a dentist‚Äôs drill shredding a soft, pink nerve.\\" Likewise, Vulture writer Kathryn VanArendonk said the show ignores or does not address many parenting details that make fatherhood difficult, such as what the Child eats, when he goes to sleep, and whether he wears diapers. She wrote: \\"The Mandalorian is uninterested in diapers, and so Mando gets to be a very particular image of fatherhood: the guy who doesn't have to sweat the small stuff.\\" VanAnderonk described this as a wish fulfillment fantasy for parents or prospective parents: \\"a vision of parenting stripped so thoroughly of all detail and specificity that all that‚Äôs left are archetypes: the parent, the child\\". The Child encounters a handful of other protector figures throughout the first season, including Omera, IG-11, and Peli Motto. Some observers have criticized the series for the fact that the Mandalorian repeatedly leaves the Child alone or in the hands of relative strangers, as well as for making decisions that place the Child in danger. One example is in \\"Chapter 6: The Prisoner\\", when he allows a team of dangerous mercenaries to use his ship while the Child is on board, nearly resulting in the Child's death. An interaction the Mandalorian has with Peli Motto in \\"Chapter 5: The Gunslinger\\" is one of the most overt discussions about the challenges of caring for the Child. When the Mandalorian accidentally wakes the child, who had been sleeping in Peli's arms, she chides him: \\"Do you have any idea how long it took me to get it to sleep?\\" She also condemns the Mandalorian for leaving the child alone on the ship, saying: \\"you have an awful lot to learn about raising a young one\\". ScreenCrush writer Matt Singer argued the Mandalorian's parenting errors makes the show that much more appealing and relatable because making mistakes is a large part of being a parent. =Good and evil; nature versus nurture= One scene in \\"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\\" led many fans to reevaluate the Child and question whether he may demonstrate evil tendencies. During a scene on the Mandalorian's spaceship, the Child observes as the Mandalorian and Cara Dune engage in a friendly arm wrestling match. During the contest, the Child uses the Force to choke Cara, nearly strangling her before the Mandalorian intervenes. Throughout the Star Wars franchise, that ability has been most commonly associated with the dark side of the Force, and particularly with the antagonist character Darth Vader. Sarah Bea Milner of Screen Rant wrote: \\"The moment is genuinely shocking ‚Äî and more than a little disturbing.\\" Some reviewers noted, however, that the Child likely mistakenly believed the Mandalorian was in danger and intervened to help. Additionally, in the same episode, the Child uses the Force to heal and save Greef Karga, a power typically associated with the Light Side. Peter Foy of Comic Book Resources wrote: \\"It doesn't exactly seem realistic that Disney would blow its merchandising potential with the little cutie by going all Damien (The Omen) in his storyline.\\" Nevertheless, some writers have suggested viewers had been underestimating the Child's capacity for evil because he is cute. Fans speculated the Child could be presenting a false personality or using the Force to manipulate people into caring about him to help ensure his survival. Esquire writer Matt Miller noted that Yoda lied about his identity during his initial appearance in The Empire Strikes Back, posing as a simple- minded observer to Luke Skywalker before revealing himself to be a Jedi Master. Miller suggested the Child could be putting on a similar performance. One fan theory suggests the Child could be related to a prophecy in a past Star Wars work that predicted an evil that could consume the galaxy. The prophecy, described in the novel Star Wars: Master and Apprentice (2019), says: \\"The danger of the past is not past, but sleeps in an egg. When the egg cracks, it will threaten the galaxy entire.\\" Fans theorized this could refer to the Child, who sleeps in an egg-like bassinet in The Mandalorian. Others have theorized the reason the Imperial remnant wants the Child is to turn him over to the dark side of the Force, or for use as a weapon. Moff Gideon in the season finale says: \\"You may think you have some idea what you‚Äôre in possession of, but you do not.\\" Peter Foy of Comic Book Resources suggested this could allude to the Child's potential to cause mass destruction. Caitlin Gallagher of Bustle suggested rather than building toward the Child becoming evil, the show could be suggesting the Mandalorian needs to find a way to raise the Child in a less violent environment. All season long, the Child has witnessed those around him committing violent acts. For example, Vulture writer Keith Phipps noticed that when IG-11 kills multiple stormtroopers in front of him, the Child has a \\"look of wonder\\" in his eyes, which Phipps said \\"is hilarious, but also a little chilling\\". Some writers applied a nature versus nurture argument to this, contending the Child is becoming violent because of what he is learning based on the actions around him. This suggests the Child is not inherently good or evil, but that instead, like all children, he is impressionable and does not fully understand the events occurring around him. He is learning about life and needs guidance as he develops his abilities. This is why he uses Force powers generally associated with both the light and dark sides of the Force. It will largely fall to the Mandalorian to provide this guidance, as when the Mandalorian stops him from strangling Cara. Cultural impact =Critical reception= The Child has received a positive reception from fans and reviewers, and is widely considered the show's breakout character. Fans immediately adopted the nickname \\"Baby Yoda\\" to describe the character, a moniker Favreau has embraced as \\"the easiest, shortest, most hashtagable way to identify that character\\". However, the nickname is not used internally by the crew of The Mandalorian, and Disney CEO Bob Iger said he \\"got my wrist slapped\\" by Favreau for calling the character Baby Yoda in e-mail messages. Iger later said the scale of the positive reaction to the Child was \\"beyond my expectations by a wide margin\\". Several writers described the Child as a pop culture phenomenon, particularly noting the adoration it had received from fans on social media. The Guardian called Baby Yoda \\"2019's biggest new character\\", and Bryan Alexander of USA Today wrote: \\"There's nothing hotter in the universe than Baby Yoda.\\" Some critics noted that fandom for the Child transcended age and experience, and that few fictional characters unite entire fan bases in the way the Child had; Anthony Breznican of Vanity Fair wrote: \\"In an era of bitter division on nearly all matters, there is seemingly unanimous adoration for this tiny alien creature.\\" Vox writer Allegra Frank said the Child made The Mandalorian \\"instantly more memorable and evocative\\", and alleviated the solitude and tension that might otherwise have surrounded the show's protagonist. Carolyn Giardina of The Hollywood Reporter said the Child helped The Mandalorian not only achieve critical and commercial success, but also impact the cultural zeitgeist. Beyond the show, other writers have described the character as a key component in the success of Disney's rollout of the Disney+ streaming service. Julia Alexander of The Verge wrote: \\"There's no question that Baby Yoda is driving interest in Disney+\\". Some critics called the Child one of the best and most lauded new Star Wars characters in recent memory, while others said the character had made the Star Wars franchise relevant to an even wider range of audiences. Vulture writer Madison Malone Kircher described the Child as an example of a character so popular that his fame nearly eclipsed that of his own franchise, comparing him to Baby Groot from the Guardians of the Galaxy films. The Guardian writer Zach Vasquez noted past Star Wars works had featured young characters that have not resonated as strongly as the Child, so he credited his success with the character's designers and special effects. Likewise, Robyn Bahr of The Hollywood Reporter said the positive response to the Child, along with that of the show The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, demonstrate that audiences still desire puppetry, animatronics, and practical effects rather than only CGI. Bahr wrote: \\"If Baby Yoda were entirely 3D animation, he wouldn't have become an icon the minute we laid our eyes on him.\\" The Child was featured on the cover of the December 2019 issue of The Hollywood Reporter, along with the headline: \\"Baby Yoda represents the future of Hollywood\\". In an article in the magazine, writer Rebecca Keegan argued the Child is the culmination of several shifts and trends in the entertainment industry over the decade prior to the release of The Mandalorian. These include the decline of the traditional movie star, the growth of streaming media services, the rise of Internet culture, and technological advances in CGI. An online report conducted an analysis of which U.S. states responded most positively to the Child, finding that interest in him was highest in Utah, and lowest in Mississippi. Variety writer Caroline Framke said she fell in love with the character even despite acknowledging that he is an \\"inherently manipulative product of the most powerful media conglomerate\\". Not all reviews of the Child were positive. Rolling Stone writer Alan Sepinwall said the reveal of the Child was a rehash of the appearance of Rotta the Hutt in Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Emily VanDerWerff of Vox described the character as \\"yet another merchandising opportunity\\" and did not feel the character was worth Disney attempting to keep secret before his reveal. BBC writer Caryn James said he did not believe anyone without an emotional attachment to Star Wars would care about the Child. Jeremy Gordon of The Outline called the Child the \\"product of a merciless capitalist machine\\" intended primarily to generate merchandising revenue for Disney. Gordon wrote: \\"It's not really Baby Yoda I hate, of course. He's really cute. It's the feeling that I'm being pandered to, that all of this is a foregone conclusion.\\" Emma Gray Ellis wrote that there was some backlash to the Child on social media in response to the character's massive Internet popularity. She wrote: \\"There's something grindingly, performatively grouchy in leaping forward to damn something that 'everyone' likes, in no small part because everyone likes it.\\" The Child ranked first on several Screen Rant lists about the series, including the most interesting characters from the first season of The Mandalorian, the best characters from the show, and the best costumes from the first season. =Internet memes= The Child quickly became a popular Internet meme. In the week following the debut of The Mandalorian, the Child was driving almost twice as many social media interactions on news stories about it as any of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. The Baby Yoda search term saw continuous growth on Google Trends in the weeks following the release of The Mandalorian. There were 2.28 million social media interactions about the characters on news stories in the first two weeks after the release of The Mandalorian, and 2 million tweets featuring the words \\"Baby Yoda\\" were sent on Twitter between November 12 and December 5, 2019. When Favreau tweeted a concept art image of the character by artist Christian Alzmann on November 19, it received more than 34,000 retweets and 217,000 likes within one week. Various celebrities have tweeted about the character, including Ariana Grande, Elon Musk, Dwayne Johnson, Russell Wilson, Alex Rodriguez, and Donald Trump Jr. Zach Vasquez of The Guardian wrote: \\"It's now practically impossible to scroll through any social media platform without being inundated with pics, videos, memes and gifs of the bug-eyed, big-eared tot.\\" The Los Angeles Times included the Child in its list of \\"2019's Internet Obsessions\\", with writer Christie D'Zurilla writing: \\"Baby Yoda won the Internet in 2019.\\" One of the more popular memes involved a screenshot from \\"Chapter 4: Sanctuary\\" in which the Child casually sips from a mug of soup, which has been compared to a similar meme of Kermit the Frog passive-aggressively sipping a glass of tea. Another popular meme used a scene from that episode in which the Child randomly presses buttons in the cockpit of the Mandalorian's spaceship, with most of the memes changing the audio so that it appeared the Child was trying to put various songs on the radio. In late November 2019, the online GIF database Giphy temporarily removed its GIFs of the Child due to \\"confusion\\" over the legal status of the images, sparking outrage among fans. However, they were quickly restored, and Giphy issued an apology to Disney for having removed them. Various sports teams have created their own memes with the Child, including Los Angeles Clippers, New York Islanders, Phoenix Suns, Pittsburgh Steelers, San Francisco Giants, Sacramento Kings, Seattle Mariners, and Tennessee Volunteers football. =Cultural references= In December 2019, artwork of Disney CEO Bob Iger with the Child appeared in the Time magazine article naming Iger their Businessperson of the Year. The New Yorker published a cartoon of a woman pushing a baby stroller and saying to the baby inside it: \\"No offense, but Baby Yoda, like, blows you out of the water.\\" Ice2Ice, a musician associated with the website The Ringer, released \\"Dear Baby Yoda: A Love Song\\" on December 3, 2019, with the music based upon the song \\"Dear Theodosia\\" from the musical Hamilton. The character was also mentioned in the December 2019 South Park episode \\"Basic Cable\\". In the episode, a character named Scott Malkinson attempts to get Disney+ because the woman he is interested in loves the Child, so he believes she will love him too if he gets the streaming service. The Child was also parodied in the December 14, 2019 episode of Saturday Night Live. He was portrayed by comedian Kyle Mooney in a Weekend Update segment, in which he gossiped about the Mandalorian cast, talked about his future business ventures, and threatened Baby Groot. At the 77th Golden Globe Awards, host Ricky Gervais jokingly mistook Joe Pesci for \\"Baby Yoda\\". On February 20, the United States Army revealed that a M1 Abrams tank belonging to the 3rd Infantry Division of Fort Stewart in Georgia had been named after the Child, with the words \\"BABY YODA\\" printed on the barrel of its gun. Some critics have noted that other media companies introduced young versions of their own characters following the debut of the Child, and suggested they could be attempts to capitalize on the Child's success. As an example, Ashley Carman of The Verge cited \\"Baby Sonic\\", a young version of the video game character Sonic the Hedgehog who appears in his 2020 film, which she described as \\"like something ripped out of Disney's playbook\\". =Merchandise= Due to the secrecy surrounding the Child, designs of the character were withheld from product manufacturers in the months prior to the release of The Mandalorian. As a result, toys and merchandise of the character were not available in time for the 2019 Christmas season, despite a high demand for them. The Walt Disney Company accepted this plan despite knowing it would cost the company merchandising revenue in the short term; Favreau said \\"they understood the value of it\\". Iger said if the Child's design had been distributed for toys before the show's release, \\"it would have gone out to hundreds and hundreds of people, probably all over the world, and we didn't want to do that\\". Iger reiterated that Disney is a story-first company which has \\"never set out to tell a story simply because it can become a toy or a game or a consumer product of some sort\\", and he described the wait to unveil the Child as \\"worth it\\". The Amazon product research tool Jungle Scout projected that Disney may have lost $2.7 million in revenue because of the delay in release merchandise of the Child; demand for toys of the Child were so high that Amazon customers searched for Baby Yoda products more than 90,000 times in one month. David Lazarus, consumer columnist for the Los Angeles Times, said he understood Disney's strategy, but felt the company missed out on significant commercial opportunity: \\"The fact that they didn't anticipate that this was going to be a commercial goldmine is insane, and that they let this opportunity slip away strikes me as sheer madness.\\" Due to the scarcity of licensed merchandise of the Child, many unlicensed products featuring the character were created and sold through the Internet, including via websites like Etsy. These included felt and crocheted dolls, shirts, jewellery, Christmas ornaments, art prints, bumper stickers, coffee mugs, and more. Do it yourself videos were also produced showing how fans could make their own toys based upon the Child. The top 47 unofficial Child products by Amazon merchants sold an average of 1,842 pieces of merchandise in the month following the show's release, at an average of $23 per product. In mid-January 2020, Disney issued takedown notices against several Etsy sellers using the words \\"Star Wars\\", \\"Mandalorian\\", and \\"Yoda\\", citing copyright violations. Official soft goods such as T-shirts were the first to be made available because they were the easiest to produce. The first two official dolls of the Child released were a 10-inch Funko figurine and an 11-inch plush toy from Mattel, which began shipping in February. Pre-orders for the Funko doll made it the top toy on Amazon upon its release. More official merchandise is expected to be released in early 2020. In December 2019, the Electronic Arts video game The Sims 4 added \\"The Child Statue\\" as a purchasable decoration. Several toys of the Child were announced American International Toy Fair in New York City in February 2020, most notably a nearly life-sized animatronic Child toy by Hasbro, which moves, blinks, and makes sounds like the actual character. The toy sold out within days of its announcement, with new deliveries not expected until December 2020. Other toys announced at the Fair include a Child waffle iron, Chia Pets of the Child, and a vehicle set as part of Hasbro's Mission Fleet toyline, which include the Mandalorian on a speeder bike and the Child in his floating bassinet. Build-A-Bear Workshop has also announced it will release a version of a Child doll in early 2020. Lego has announced plans for an August 2020 release of BrickHeadz figures of both the Child and the Mandalorian, as well as a September 2020 release of a Lego set for the Mandalorian's Razor Crest spaceship, which will include a small figurine of the Child. In March 2020, an unofficial user-created mod for the video game Star Wars Battlefront II allowed the character BB-8 to be replaced with a playable version of the Child.

Background  Earlier, the Ottoman‚Äôs defeat in the Battle of Shaiba had damaged the authority of the Ottomans in the eyes of the Arabs,Charles Townsend, Desert Hell, The British Invasion of Mesopotamia (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2010), 90-91. and this was exacerbated by the successful ousting of the Ottomans in an uprising in Najaf, which showed the residents of Karbala the potency of a revolt, which they were willing to participate in since the Ottomans had been plundering food, money, and possessions from Karbalans to support the war effort. Emissaries from Najaf had also begun encouraging an uprising in Karbala.  Uprising  The uprising began on 27 June 1915, when the Bani Hasan tribe attacked government buildings in Karbala. The rebel tribesmen, lacking any centralized leadership, burned municipal buildings, government schools, a hospital, and 200 dwellings in the suburbs, most of them belonging to Persians living and trading in the Arab community. Charles R. H. Tripp notes that although the uprising was anti-Ottoman in a broad sense, it was not in support of the British war effort and instead intended to grant the city higher administrative autonomy. The uprising ended with an Ottoman withdrawal, securing a rebel victory and Karbala's independence from the Ottoman Empire.  Aftermath  After becoming independent from the Ottoman Empire, Karbala turned into a place of refuge for Ottoman deserters. However, Karbala suffered from a lack of centralized leadership, and was unable to establish contact with the British forces to the south due to tribes still loyal to the Ottoman Empire separating them. The Ottoman Empire re-established control of Karbala in 1916 following their victory in the Siege of Kut.

The company licenses patented breeds of fruit to growers worldwide, and is the largest private breeder of table grapes in the world. Among its variety of table grapes is Cotton Candy grapes, which it licenses to Bakersfield-based grower Grapery. History IFG was founded in 2001 in Bakersfield by David Cain, Jack Pandol, Glen Stoller, his wife Terrie Stoller, and their son Craig Stoller. Cain was a fruit breeder who in the 1970s worked in Fresno, California as a researcher with the USDA, developing new varieties of table grapes and seedless raisins. Pandol was a UC Davis plant scientist graduate and third generation grape grower who had founded grape growing company Grapery in 1996. Glen and Terrie Stoller were the founders of Bakersfield-based grapevine nursery Sunridge Nurseries, a supplier of plant material to the wine and table grape industry, and their son Craig was the company's president. A few months after forming IFG, Cain attended a trade show where researchers from the University of Arkansas were showing grapes. One was a purple Concord grape that tasted sweet like cotton candy, but was fragile with tiny seeds. He licensed that grape along with others from the university for IFG, and improved the size and texture by crossbreeding the grapes with sturdier California grapes. In 2010, after years of cross- pollinating and testing numerous grapes, IFG patented the Cotton Candy grape, and began licensing it to growers. In 2011, the company had partnered with grape grower The Grapery, which was selling IFG's Sweet Sunshine, Sweet Sapphire and Sweet Celebration. In 2018, the company's Cheery Grand cherry, seen as a possible replacement for the Chelan cherry, began getting harvested in Chile and Australia. In July 2020, the company announced six new named varieties of table grapes, bringing their total to 40. Business IFG invents, develops, and licenses proprietary hybrid fruit varieties in the United States and other countries. The varieties are patented, and IFG's income is derived from licensing the intellectual property rights in the plants it develops. When IFG develops a new variety of fruit, it applies for \\"plant variety rights\\" in countries where it wants to license the grapes. The license allows growers to grow and sell the fruits. In order to breed seedless grapes, the breeders have to take out the baby embryos from the plant, then grow them in individual test tubes in the lab before they can be planted. A new variety can take from six to fifteen years to create. Products Cotton Candy grapes in their packaging IFG breeds custom varieties of fruits including grapes and cherries, patents them and licenses them to growers. Their grapes come in red, black or green varieties. The company's licensed products include its signature Cotton Candy grapes, and Sweet Celebration, a crunchy, cherry red, mid- to late-season seedless grape with a large berry. Other shapes and flavors have names invoking sweet flavors. As of July 2020, the company had developed 40 different varieties of grapes. Operations IFG grapes are grown in the United States, Peru, Chile, Brazil and Mexico. As of August 2018, the company's grapes were being sold in 14 countries.

It was published in 1980. The story portrays the relationship between Alana, the narrator (Alana's husband of unknown name), and their cat Osiris. It touches topics such as jealousy, curiosity and love.  Plot  The story begins with the description of the way Alana and Osiris look at the narrator and between each other. They observe with confidence and without duplicity. The narrator then shows signs of jealousy towards Osiris, he expresses how he is incapable of reaching complete happiness when his wife express love towards him due to the constant presence of the cat and complains about her inability to realize and assess the situation. Furthermore, he believes his love for his wife is also not complete. He is obstinate in the idea that Alana has more to her that what she is letting him know. There are many aspects of her personality that are unfamiliar to him and that he wants to discover. At first, he decides to use music to try to discover her. He believed music helped her let go of that facade of superficial happiness and total honesty and left her naked to his eye. He felt that by doing this, he would be able to love her better, to be a better husband. He had given up trying to understand Osiris, but Alana was a work in progress. He decided to take her to an art gallery to attempt to decipher her further and deeper, as he was not pleased with what he had discovered. He was convinced there was still more of her to show.

History =Bastion Hill= In 1856, the ramparts of the Riga Fortress were demolished, replacing the 'Sand Bastion' with the name of Basteiberg () (originally known as Bastion Hill). In 1879, the Riga Gardens Directorate was established and the 27-year-old Georg Kuphaldt was officially appointed Director of the Riga Gardens. His first project was the reconstruction of the greenery of Bastejkalns. The creation of the plantation of the Bastion Hill lasted from 1859 to 1887. In 1860, a wooden pavilion was erected and replaced in 1887 with the first Bastion Hill caf√©. The waterfall cascade built from Saulkalne's dolomite into the mountain was built in 1898. It has survived to the present day, but no longer with the less sophisticated underwater lighting that was still operational at the beginning of the last century. Around 1893, a pseudo-swan-style swan cottage, work of Riga's architect Heinrich Scheel, was placed on pontoons along the Bastejkalns Canal - usually pulled ashore in the winter months, where it is still today. Swans donated by \\"Riga Bird Breeding Society\\". In 1883, at the foot of the Bastion Hill, a 23-meter-long wooden bridge was erected over the canal (its curvature was so steep that people slipped out of it in winter and the bridge was ironically called by the Riga inhabitants),Second Gabre. Riga parks hide treasures and stories. // Riga Voice. August 12, 2004 which was replaced in 1893 by masonry. Then a bridge was built to connect the Old Town with what is now Rainis Boulevard (designed in 1898, rebuilt a little later and still in operation). In 1951, according to the architect JƒÅnis Ginters project, Bastejkalns built support walls, which used parts of the buildings of Riga destroyed by World War II. The Bastion Hill greenery was restored with various sculptures in 1968. Raimonds Zalcmanis Rƒ´gas ielas: enciklopƒìdija. Riga Press House. Volume 2, 2008 The square of this public park was used until 1856 as part of the eastern fortifications and consisted in this area of earthen ramparts, covered trenches, bastions and moats. This fortress section was assigned to the commander of the 'Powder Tower'. In the following years, the open ground was reshaped by considerable landfills and the city canal and connected to the eastern suburb by new bridges. At the suggestion of the architects Johann Felsko and Otto Dietze, a green area of parks and gardens as well as a broad boulevard were created here. For a large part of the facilities, the landscape architect Georg Friedrich Ferdinand Kuphaldt was acquired as a planner. A landmark and enrichment of the plant are the 1898 designed as Wasserkunst waterfall. To those the city canal in the area of the park spanning bridges belongs the 1900 built Timmbr√ºcke. The park has been expanded to include more monuments and facilities, including the Freedom Monument and the two memorial stones for the victims of Riga citizens and security forces who died in January 1991 in an OMON deployment. As early as 1929, the construction of the Blaumanis Monument was completed. As part of a reorganization from 1968, the sculpture Peace Dance was erected in 1970.

The first general election in which women were able to participate occurred in 1928. In that election, 90 per cent of eligible women voters cast ballots. In 1930, Lady Helena Squires became the first women elected into the Newfoundland House of Assembly after winning a by-election. __TOC__  The 1890s  The Newfoundland women‚Äôs suffrage movement began in the 1890s and was closely linked to the prohibition movement. In September 1890, a local branch of the Women‚Äôs Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) formed in St. John‚Äôs. WCTU members argued that alcohol abuse was a problem in the dominion, and that it led to increased rates of domestic violence and poverty, of which women and children were the primary victims. The WCTU argued that women should be given the right to vote in local option elections, so they could vote on prohibition and other issues. To help promote its cause, the WCTU published a newsletter called the Water Lily. Edited by Jessie Ohman, it contained editorials and essays calling for women‚Äôs suffrage, as well as political cartoons skewering the Newfoundland government and Prime Minister Sir William Whiteway, who was seen as being weak on prohibition and women‚Äôs suffrage.The WCTU also circulated a petition across the island of Newfoundland, demanding the women be given the right to vote in local option elections. On March 18, 1891, WCTU members marched to the Colonial Building and gave the petition to the government.The Newfoundland legislature debated enfranchising women on March 15, 1892, but defeated the motion in a vote of 13 to ten. Another vote on May 4, 1893 was also unsuccessful, with 17 votes against the suffrage bill and 14 in favor. The WCTU then stopped advocating for suffrage and turned its attention to missionary and charitable work.  Second Wave of the Suffrage Movement  Although the WCTU was no longer fighting for women‚Äôs suffrage, the topic did not entirely disappear from the public consciousness. Suffragists were active in other parts of the world, and news of their work was reported in Newfoundland newspapers and debated in local clubs and societies. However, most clubs were fraternal and barred women. In response, a group of St. John‚Äôs women formed the Ladies Reading Room in 1909 to give women a space to discuss current affairs and read international journals and newspapers. The Reading Room also hosted a Current Events Club, which met every Saturday to debate current affairs, including suffrage. The Ladies Reading Room and Current Events Club politicized a new generation of suffragists. Its leaders included Armine Gosling, Fannie McNeil, Myra Campbell, Anna (Barnes) Mitchell, Agnes Miller Ayre, and Adeline Browning. The outbreak of the First World War caused suffragists to reduce their efforts, but, when the war ended, the movement gained significant ground. The war service of Newfoundland women helped the postwar suffragettes make their case that women deserved the vote. Women's Patriotic Association which was formed to support war effort and its leaders were to key to the postwar proliferation of women's civic organizations, including the suffrage movement. In 1920, Armine Gosling, Adeline Browning, and Anna Mitchell founded the Newfoundland Women‚Äôs Franchise League. Browning was also London representative to the International Woman Suffrage Alliance. It had one goal: to win voting rights for women. League members embarked on an island-wide publicity campaign: suffragists screened advertisements in movie houses, published essays and letters in newspapers, canvassed homes and businesses, and circulated a petition throughout the island to garner support. Their efforts ended in success on March 9, 1925, when Prime Minister Walter Stanley Monroe introduced a suffrage bill to the legislature. It passed unanimously and became law on April 13, 1925. It was not, however, a total success: women could become voters at the age of 25, while men could vote at the age of 21. Nonetheless, suffragists hailed the new law as a victory and the Women‚Äôs Franchise League changed its name to The League of Women Voters, a non-partisan organization that promoted such social issues as compulsory education, child welfare, and maternal health.

Railroad promoter Ben Holladay launched the newspaper, one of several efforts to challenge The Oregonian's position as Portland's dominant newspaper, as part of his effort to promote his railroad interests. Holladay appointed James O'Meara as editor Harvey W. Scott, renowned longtime editor of The Oregonian, became editor of the Bulletin in 1873. Scott was succeeded by T. B. Odeneal. Holladay ceased publication in 1875, claiming that he had lost nearly $200,000 on it. The Bulletin published morning, evening, and weekly editions, and claimed to be the first newspaper in the western United States to do so. It typically carried eight columns on four pages. It covered the launch of Portland's streetcar system on December 9, 1872. Also in 1872, the paper conducted a campaign against the Portland Police Bureau, and was embarrassed when the police planted a hoax story about an alleged murder. Its contents and positions were the subject of commentary in other Oregon newspapers,https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn96061148/1873-08-23/ed-1/seq-2/ and it was known for its adversarial relationship with The Oregonian.https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn93051637/1873-01-25/ed-1/seq-2/https://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83025138/1911-02-04/ed-1/seq-19/https://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn97071110/1904-01-28/ed-1/seq-3/ Another paper, called the Evening Bulletin, appeared briefly in 1868, prior to the launch of the Daily Bulletin. It was not connected with Holladay's venture, and it was edited and published by J. F. Atkinson. Atkinson later bought an interest in the Portland Bee as it was declining in 1880.

Publication history Citi-Block was written by Richard Halliwell, Carl Sargent, Alan Merrett, and Graeme Davis, with art by Gordon Moore and Dave Andrews, and was published by Games Workshop in 1987 as a boxed set with a 20-page booklet and 12 color cardstock sheets (four pages of cut- out props and eight 11\\" x 16\\" floor plans.) Contents Citi-Block contains full-color building floor plans marked in 25mm/1-inch squares, with detailed rules for designing standard Mega-City blocks, as well as rules for use with Warhammer 40,000. The floor plans include eight 11‚Äù x 17‚Äù layouts printed in full color on thin cardstock: * two of motorways and foot corridors * one of small offices * one helipad/hoverbus stop * one sky-rail station * one entrance plaza (for an office building or residential block) * one enclosed landscaped garden * a empty area enclosed by walls Also included are two 11‚Äù x 17‚Äù sheets of thicker card stock, printed with various cut-out details like desks, cars, plants, and phone booths. Reception In the July 1989 edition of Dragon (Issue #135), Ken Rolston called the floor plans \\"perfectly designed for role-playing displays.\\" He liked the suggestion of \\"a worn, shabby future\\" and suggested they could be used for games outside of Judge Dredd, although their less-than-pristine look made them \\"less useful for far-future settings like the Star Trek game or Star Wars games, unless used for scenarios on backwater or frontier planets.\\" He called the charts and guidelines for creating a Mega-City block in the rulebook \\"admirably detailed and specific, and are an essential supplement for anyone running a Judge Dredd game campaign.\\" Rolston concluded, \\"As floor plans for role-playing displays, the Citi-Block pack is good-looking, utilitarian, flexible, and suitable for many near-future SFRPGs.\\" Reviews *White Dwarf (Issue 95 - Nov 1987) *Challenge #35 (1988) References Category:Role-playing game books ","title":"Citi-Block"},{"id":"62386954","title":"Preston Fassel"},{"id":"62386966","text":"On the Count of Three is an upcoming film, directed by Jerrod Carmichael, from a screenplay by Ari Katcher and Ryan Welch.

It awards the Juris Doctor degree in its full-time and part-time programs and is a member of the Association of American Law Schools (AALS).  History  The Widener University School of Law in Harrisburg was founded in 1989, as an expansion of Widener University's existing law school in Wilmington, Delaware. Anthony J. Santoro, who served as Dean of law from 1983‚Äì1992, felt that there was a need for legal education in Harrisburg, the capital city of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The law school became one of two law school campuses operated by Widener University. On July 1, 2015, the two campuses separated into two distinct law schools that operate independently of each other, but remain part of the Widener University. Each law school has its own dean, faculty, students, curriculum, and accreditation. The first Dean of the renamed Widener University Commonwealth Law School in Harrisburg was Christian A. Johnson. The law school chose the name Commonwealth to reflect its mission and ties to the Pennsylvania government and in recognition of Pennsylvania as one of four commonwealths in the nation.

Moorthy Kannan. The film features Prithvi Rajan and Karthika Adaikalam in lead roles, with Velu Prabhakaran, Rohini, J. Livingston, Venu Arvind, Sugi, Kathaka Thirumavalavan, Gowri and Kovai Guna playing supporting roles. The film, produced by P. R. Suresh Kumar, had musical score by Srikanth Deva and was released on 12 October 2007. Plot The film begins with the popular writer Jayavarman (Velu Prabhakaran) attending a function in honour of him. In the mid of the function, he tells that he has important work and leaves the function in a hurry. He then meets an old woman (Rohini) in her house and narrates her a story. In a village near Mayiladuthurai, the teenagers Sakthi (Prithvi Rajan) and Nangai (Karthika Adaikalam) are friends since their childhood and they eventually fall in love with each other. Sakthi is the son of the honest village administrative officer (J. Livingston) while Nangai is the daughter of the village president (Gowri) who is fanatical about her caste and her family honour. When Nangai's mother comes to know about their love affair, she forces Nangai to forget her lover Sakthi but Nangai continues to secretly meet him. After being threatened by Nangai's father, Shakti and his parents are forced to leave the village. They start living with Shakti's uncle (Venu Arvind) who is a press reporter in the city. Sakthi cannot forget her so he secretly goes to his native village and comes to know that Nangai got married and settled down in Singapore. A heartbroken Sakthi returns to the city. He then befriends the modern city woman Priya (Sugi) who has a tragic past. One day, Sakthi and Priya take a pregnant woman who is also mentally ill to the hospital and they discover that mentally ill women are raped in a mental asylum. One night, Sakthi and Priya sneak into the mental asylum to take photos of the crime committed by the wardens. Sakthi saves a mentally ill woman from the wardens and she is none other than his lover Nangai. A few months ago, Nangai's mother mixed poison in her milk to kill her for bringing shame to the family but Nangai survived and became mentally ill. Thereafter, her parents put her in a mental asylum in the city. Back to the present, Jayavarman turns out to be Sakthi and the old woman is none other than his lover Nangai. After finding her in the mental asylum, Sakthi took her with him and he took care of her in his house. Every day, Nangai asks him to tell a story and Sakthi narrates her one. Thereafter, Sakthi wrote novels under the pseudonym of Jayavarman and became a popular writer. The film ends with Sakthi and Nangai hugging each other.

Karthika Adaikalam was selected to play his love interest. Speaking about the film, Prithvi Rajan said, \\"The film is a teenage love story and has enough scope for me to prove my acting credentials.

Release A critic said, \\"As a whole analyzing the film, it‚Äôs a good film, but the same wine in different bottle. Many films focusing on the love that blooms between a boy and girl during adolescent age have already hit the screens and the only difference here is Karthiga‚Äôs characterization\\". A reviewer called it \\"watchable\\" despite the clich√©d narration and praised the film's ending. Another critic wrote, \\"Naalaiya.. is an effort worth appreciating by first-time director Moorthy Kannan.

Lee's airbrush paintings often combine digital technologies with traditional media. He also works in sculpture and video. Art critic Will Heinrich at The New York Times affirmed, ‚ÄúAustin Lee‚Äôs analog portraits of cyberspace are strangely fascinating.\\" As the artist intuitively translates gestural marks from one media to another, his works attract the viewers with their pathos and savvy sense of humor. Jeffrey Deitch has compared Lee‚Äôs practice to Pop Art, ‚ÄúAs Andy Warhol used photo silkscreens to connect painting with the image-making technologies of the 1960s, Lee fuses digital techniques with traditional painting and sculptural processes to create totally contemporary works of art.\\"  Early life and education  Lee was born in Las Vegas, Nevada, and raised in Philadelphia. He received an MFA in Painting from Yale School of Art in 2013 and a BFA in Painting from Tyler School of Art in 2006. While a student at the Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia, Lee's studio doubled as a gallery space where he organized group and solo exhibitions to promote his artistic community. After attending Yale for his MFA, Lee moved to New York in 2013.  Work  As the artist intuitively translates gestural marks from one media to another, his works attract the viewers with their pathos and savvy sense of humor. Lee once defined himself \\"a computer nerd as well as an artist.\\" The use of digital platforms and technologies offer him the opportunity to work against the tradition of painting: Lee transitioned from using Adobe Photoshop in his early work to adopting the Oculus Rift's virtual- reality program Medium as an imaginary studio. He then transfers the V.R. drawings to the canvas through the use of the airbrush and the paintbrush. As a result of this technique, the final paintings are very luminous and evoke both the light of a computer screen and the intense coloration of color field painting. Lee investigates how different types of human gestures and touch ‚Äì both digitally rendered and organic ‚Äì can affect viewers. The artist sources his subjects from his daily life: people who attract his attention on the subway or the internet, scenes of ordinary activities, animals, and flowers. Many of Lee‚Äôs works evoke the emojis that have become part of everyday conversation. However, by confronting the viewer with familiar images, his works explore the dichotomy of contemporary phenomena, such as social media, that carry both positive and negative effects. Further exploiting the possibilities offered by the world of V.R., Lee has also created a series of sculptures that give form to his digital drawings with the use of a 3D printer. While at first glance, the subjects of these sculptures appear joyful and soothing, the distortions of forms attribute a disturbing note to their flashy cheerfulness. Lee‚Äôs work entertains a dialogue with the work of artists from older generations. While the effortlessness of Alex Katz‚Äôs paintings has certainly influenced him, the use of new technology in David Hockney‚Äôs iPad Drawings and Cindy Sherman‚Äôs Instagram self-portraits likewise resonates in Lee‚Äôs works.

It has been termed \\"Shetland's national dish\\"  Etymology  The name reestit mutton comes from the Shetland dialect word reest, meaning a wooden framework traditionally placed across the rafters of a building, from which the mutton would traditionally be hung to dry with the aid of smoke from a peat fire.  Origin  Reestit mutton was traditionally prepared as a way of preserving mutton so that it could be eaten during winter. It is related to similar Scandinavian methods of drying meat, such as skerpikj√∏t. If prepared correctly reestit mutton can remain edible for up to four years.  Preparation  Reestit mutton is prepared by soaking a leg or shoulder of mutton in brine. The correct ratio of course salt to water for the brine is achieved when a potato or egg will float in the solution. Some recipes also call for the addition of a small amount of sugar or saltpetre to the solution. The mutton is kept in the brine until the solution has reached all parts of the meat, which can take around three weeks. The meat is then hung to dry in proximity to a peat fire until the meat solidifies..  Flavour  Reestit mutton has a salty flavour, which is also influenced by the peat smoke which it is exposed to when drying. The food is considered nostalgic by Shetlanders. The first butcher to sell reestit mutton on a commercial basis in Lerwick, Shetland advertised it as having \\"an acquired taste that you acquire at the first taste\\".  Dishes  Reestit mutton is commonly used as the basis for reestit mutton soup. The soup is made with tatties (potatoes), and is commonly served with bannocks - small savoury scone-like baked items. This dish is commonly associated with the Up Helly Aa fire festival. It can also be used as the filling of a reestit mutton pie.

It was consciously formed as a youth organization instead of just a students‚Äô organization, as a large majority of our country‚Äôs youth remains outside the sphere of higher education. Only about 26.3% get to enter the higher educational institutions as per the 2018-2019 AISHE survey. Of this a large percentage is languishing in informal mode of education. As such, it is mainly through the struggles of those in informal education/outside education that change can be envisaged in society, and the fight for equality strengthened. Thus, the organization has consistently raised issues and demands which are of utmost concern for the most exploited and oppressed sections in the society. On the education front, KYS has been taking up the issues related to equality in school education through implementation of common school system, the discriminatory nature of higher educational institutions as far as access to higher educational institutions is concerned, the increasing phenomenon of informal education both at the school level as well as in the higher education sector, etc. Apart from such issues related to equality in education, KYS has been at the forefront of struggles against the various ills which plague our society such as women‚Äôs oppression, communalism, casteism, racism, etc. It aims to bring about equality in society through the destruction of capitalism and imperialism, and seeks to unite the various struggles against oppression and exploitation around the world through international solidarity.

Built in 1966 to replace a \\"landmark\\" Victorian chapel on a different site, the new church building is a distinctive and \\"elegant\\" example of modern architecture. History Waterlooville (historically known as Waterloo and Waterloo Ville) developed from the early 19th century as a linear settlement along the A3 road from London to Portsmouth, on land made available by the enclosure of the Forest of Bere. Since then it has transformed from a residential area to a \\"large village with urban characteristics\\", including several coaching inns, and by the 1960s had become the focus of a sprawling suburban area. Ecclesiastically the village was in the parish of Farlington. The Anglican St George's Church was built in the early 19th century, and Nonconformists were initially catered for by a building called Ebenezer Chapel which had been registered in November 1874. This was succeeded by a new centrally located Baptist chapel built between 1884 and 1885 to the design of George Rake, a locally prolific architect, and registered in September 1885. This \\"elaborate\\" building and adjacent institution, designed in the Italianate style and featuring a tower, was one of the town's \\"few architectural landmarks\\". The town's rapid postwar growth, including the development of several overspill estates for people moved out of war-damaged Portsmouth, prompted wholesale redevelopment of the town centre in the 1960s. The area around the old crossroads of the London Road and the road to Hambledon was rebuilt with new commercial and industrial buildings, and the 1885 Baptist chapel was demolished as part of this. A new site was found further north on London Road, and construction of a replacement church started in 1966. It opened in 1967. Architecture Architect Michael Manser set up in solo practice in 1961 and became known for \\"uncompromisingly modern work\\". His design for the new Waterlooville Baptist Church reflected these principles and has attracted widespread praise from architectural historians. Alan Balfour described it as \\"elegant and superbly constructed\\" and \\"architecture of high quality\\", noting particularly the \\"subtlety\\" of its internal layout and proportions. The Pevsner Architectural Guides describe it as \\"an impressively economical design, in form and materials\\". The church is steel- framed using projecting black-painted I-beams laid both horizontally and vertically. Glazed curtain walling encloses the whole entrance vestibule on the front of the church, which faces west on to the north‚Äìsouth London Road. Internally the a tall box with a central division formed by a full-height altar screen, the back of which can be seen through the fully glazed front elevation. There is also an entrance on the side of the building. Behind the dividing wall (to the east) is a hall which can be used for various purposes; it flanked by shorter single-storey \\"wings\\" forming smaller spaces used for offices and similar. There is also a moveable screen dividing the hall and the church. The altar screen is \\"a solid volume of raw grey brick\\", and the side wings and rear parts of the building are of the same brickwork. The furnishings are plain and simple, of marble and steel, apart from a 19th- century pulpit. Administration Waterlooville Baptist Church is registered for worship in accordance with the Places of Worship Registration Act 1855; its number on the register is 70818. It was registered for the solemnisation of marriages in accordance with the Marriage Act 1949 on 6 February 1967. It belongs to the Southern Counties Baptist Association, one of 13 regional divisions within Baptists Together (the Baptist Union of Great Britain). Services are held on Sundays at 10.30am and 6.30pm. Other community activities take place throughout the week. The church also hosts companies of the Boys' Brigade and Girls' Brigade. Since 2016, the church has been involved with two other local churches in a joint ministry project at Berewood, a new housing estate being built close to Waterlooville. Regular activities take place at Berewood Primary School on the estate.

Gameplay City States of Arklyrell is a game designed by Mike Joslyn in which players compete to control the eight Citadels on the world of Arklyrell. The game components consist of: * 16-page rulebook * 17\\" x 21\\" color map * 54 counters The game map represents an entire world, with six continents and the poles at the north and south of the map. =Turn sequence= Each player does the following sequence. # Moves units Each unit has an allowance factor, which is moderated by difficult terran such as deserts or mountains. Players must use either boats or giant rocs to move their units between continents. Units leaving either the east or west edges of the map reappear on the opposite edge of the map. # Recruitment Each player has a leader who can attempt to recruit one unit per turn. # Resolves combat There are no zones of control to hamper movement, and the active player initiates combat if wanted. Combat is resolved with a die roll modified by the difference in the combat values of the units involved, as well as terrain, and the type of defender. Possible results are: no result; retreat of all attacking units; or retreat of all defenders. If a unit cannot retreat, it is eliminated. (Leaders cannot be eliminated.) =Magic items= There are seven magic items scattered across the continents. Two of these are fake, forcing the player to miss the next turn. The others help in recruiting and combat. =Victory conditions= The player who controls the most citadels after 25 turns is the winner. Reception In the February 1984 edition of Dragon (Issue #82), Steve List was not impressed by the game, saying that it \\"doesn‚Äôt have what it takes to stand out... It has nothing to make it better than the many others of its ilk that are already available. The combat system is pedestrian; its only original feature is the procedure for losing control of units due to morale effects. The game is basically a pastiche of game mechanics that have been used before, re-assembled in a package that is not noticeably more interesting or exciting than its predecessors.\\" References Category:Board games introduced in 1983 Category:Task Force Games games ","title":"City States of Arklyrell"},{"id":"62387542","title":"Results of the 2002 Swedish general election"},{"id":"62387551","title":"Kaohsiung Exhibition Center light rail station"},{"id":"62387557","text":"Anak ni Waray vs. Anak ni Biday (International title: Hidden Lies / ) is a 2020 Philippine television drama series broadcast by GMA Network.

The Christmas EP has five original songs and three interludes featuring Jim Cummings; The Vox Ensemble of the Columbus Gay Men's Chorus are featured on \\"Santa Will Be Gone\\". \\"Jingle Juice\\" has a music video. The EP peaked at number five on Billboard Comedy Albums chart, and had a generally-positive reception. Development The EP features Jim Cummings (pictured in 2018). Nina West (Andrew Levitt's drag persona) began work on the project in July 2019. She completed five songs, which she described as \\"very different\\" and representative of \\"all of these different parts of Andrew and Nina respectively, and my sensibilities around the holidays, both in and out of drag\\". She met American voice actor and singer Jim Cummings in August, at a D23 event through Cummings' ex-wife and daughter, who are fans of RuPaul's Drag Race, the American reality television series in which Nina West competed (season 11). Needing someone to voice Santa Claus and tie the songs together, West recruited Cummings. In a Billboard interview, she recalled that he agreed to participate \\"without batting a lash\\". West described herself as a \\"lifelong Disney fan\\" who was \\"hyper aware of Jim for a long time\\": \\"His voice is synonymous with so many Disney characters that you likely are a fan of his without knowing it\\". She said about working with him: Composition The EP includes five original songs and three \\"whimsical\\" interludes with Cummings (\\"Santa's Not So Little Helper\\", \\"Nina the Extra Elf\\", and \\"The West Christmas Ever\\"). Billboard Stehen Daw wrote, \\"The new project sees the star tackling all the genres she can, from country-rock to classic choral Christmas, all while playing up her character as Nina the Elf, and not-so-helpful helper of Santa Claus.\\" \\"Jingle Juice\\" was described as a \\"honky-honk holiday hoedown\\" by Hollywood Life's Jason Brow. West said that the song was her favorite to sing and record for the EP, and described \\"Jingle Juice\\" as having a \\"rockabilly, Chris Stapleton, stomp-clap, Christmas at a saloon in the North Pole kind of vibe\\". She said about the song: \\"Christmas Arrow\\" commemorates one of West's favorite singers. In \\"Cha Cha Heels\\", she declares John Waters Female Trouble (1974) a Christmas film; West said that the song allows her to connect with her appreciation for Broadway theatre, \\"like it's a weird extension of Hairspray\\". In \\"It's Chris, Miss\\", she asks Santa Claus for some Hollywood \\"hunks\\" under her Christmas tree. West described the song as \\"ridiculousness\\" and \\"really really fun ... because lyrically, it is just so dumb\\". \\"Santa Will Be Gone\\" features the Vox Ensemble of the Columbus Gay Men's Chorus. Release and promotion West (left) at RuPaul's DragCon LA in 2019 promoting Drag Is Magic, one of three EPs she released in 2019 along with John Goodman and The West Christmas Ever The West Christmas Ever was released by Producer Entertainment Group on November 8, 2019, following her previous EPs Drag Is Magic and John Goodman (both released on the same label on May 17, 2019). \\"Jingle Juice\\" music video sees West bring the holiday spirit to people \\"stuck without really celebrating the seasons\\". She said that the video has \\"a mix of the Wild West themes\\" and was influenced by Dolly Parton, Hee Haw and Lady Bunny, one of her favorite entertainers. The video also refers to National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989). According to West, \\"the idea of going to a town where it was kind of isolated and stuck in a certain time\\" was an inspiration for the video. To commemorate West being named National Volunteer Fundraiser of the Year, her foundation launched \\"The West Christmas Ever ‚Äî 25 days of Christmas\\" to present $1,000 grants to LGBT+ organizations across the U.S. every day from December 1 to December 25. Reception Randy Shulman of Metro Weekly called the collection \\"as festive and funny as you'd hope\\", and Decider.com's Brett White said that the EP \\"is sure to spice up your holiday plans with a bit of that Nina West magic, which is kind of a mix of cinnamon and a warm hug\\". Jason Brow wrote for Hollywood Life, \\"Nina gives Santa Claus a run for his money when it comes to spreading the holiday spirit ... her trademark humor is ever-present ...[which]... reminds us that we need to carry this moment of 'peace on earth, goodwill to all' beyond December\\".

A veteran of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese Civil War, and the Korean War, he was appointed Commander of the 38th Army of the People's Liberation Army in 1978. In 1984, he was appointed the second Commander of the People's Armed Police (PAP), a year after its founding, serving until his retirement in 1990.  Republic of China  Li was born in December 1923 into a tenant peasant family Yinan County, Shandong, Republic of China. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, he enlisted in the Eighth Route Army in August 1938 and joined the Communist Party of China in the same year. Serving in the Shandong Column and later as a platoon commander in the 115th Division of the Eighth Route Army, he participated in almost 100 battles against Japanese invaders in Shandong. After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Li became a member of the Northeastern Democratic United Army (later Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army), and fought in many battles of the Chinese Civil War, including Siping, Liaoxi, Tianjin, and the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign. During the war he was promoted to company and then battalion commander.  People's Republic of China  After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Li served as Commander of the 337th Regiment of the 38th Army and studied at the PLA National Defence University. Upon graduation, he was deployed to North Korea in 1952 to participate in the Korean War. In his first battle of the war, he was credited with taking over Height 200 on the 38th parallel from American forces. His unit participated in the Battle of Tokchon, during which the 38th Army took over the city of Tokchon and inflicted substantial losses on the 7th Infantry Division of South Korea. Upon his return from Korea, Li was promoted to Deputy Commander of the 112th Division and later Commander of the 114th Division. He was awarded the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1955 and colonel in 1960. He was appointed Deputy Commander and Chief of Staff of the 38th Army in July 1969, and promoted to Commander of the 38th Army in May 1978. = Commander of the People's Armed Police = In 1984, Li was transferred to the People's Armed Police (PAP), which had been established a year before, to serve as its second commander. He was awarded the rank of lieutenant general in January 1989. In October 1987, he led the PAP operation to put down the Tibetan unrest. During the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, Li reportedly instructed Xu Qinxian, his former subordinate and successor as Commander of the 38th Army, not to suppress the protesters without the approval of all three leaders of the Central Military Commission‚ÄîDeng Xiaoping, Zhao Ziyang, and Yang Shangkun‚Äîknowing that Zhao would not approve such an order. Xu refused to lead the army to Beijing and was subsequently relieved of his command. When the 38th Army entered Beijing under a new commander, the PAP was ordered to open a path for the army through the barricades and protesters on the roads leading to the Tiananmen Square. In the night of 3 June, the PAP forces were able to reach the square without causing bloodshed, using only stun batons and fibreglass shields to dispel the crowds, whereas the 38th Army that followed them opened fire on the protesters and committed the Tiananmen Square massacre. According to Gao Xin of Radio Free Asia, this was a major embarrassment for the Chinese government and the military. A few months after the crackdown, Li and three other top officers of the PAP were dismissed in February 1990, and he officially retired. Li was a delegate to the 12th and 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. He also served as a member of the 8th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Li died on 10 November 2019 in Beijing, aged 95.

Clytia has the free-swimming jellyfish form typical of the Hydrozoa, as well as vegetatively propagating polyps. Clytia hemisphaerica has emerged as a promising model organism as its life cycle, small size, and relatively easy upkeep make it conducive to experimental manipulation and maintenance in a laboratory setting. Some examples of studies already conducted in Clytia include those looking at embryonic development, differential patterns of gene expression during life stages, and wound healing. Clytia‚Äôs genome was sequenced in full in March 2019. Head of a C. hemisphaerica gastrozooid polyp Baby C. hemisphaerica medusa  Anatomy and life cycle  Adult C. hemisphaerica medusa, side view Clytia hemisphaerica reproduces sexually. Ovulated eggs are fertilized externally and take approximately 24 hours to develop into planula. The ciliated planula will swim freely until the proper external cues, for instance, experimental treatment with CsCl, trigger the metamorphic process. The planula can undergo its metamorphosis into a polyp as soon as three days after fertilization. Once the proper external cue is received, the planula stops swimming and attaches itself to a substrate via its aboral or aboral-lateral pole (what was previously the front end of the swimming planula). After attaching itself to a substrate, the planula contracts along its oral‚Äìaboral axis and so forms a flattened holdfast to anchor itself to the substrate. Once the planula is securely on its substrate, a stalk grows out of the holdfast and, eventually, a hydranth, also known as a gastrozooid (an individual polyp specializing in feeding) forms on the anterior end of the stalk. At this stage, the planula is now considered a primary polyp, and this polyp can propagate vegetatively by extending its stolon to form a connected colony of multiple polyps. Polyp colonies are essentially considered immortal; as long as they receive the proper nutrients, they can continuously replace their old parts and expand across their substrate. In addition to the feeding gastrozooids, a mature polyp colony has reproductive gonozooids that produce baby medusa by budding. These medusa reach maturity after 2‚Äì3 weeks. Like most Cnidarians, Clytia has relatively simple morphology. However, despite containing relatively few cell types and lacking elaborate organ structures, the medusa have much greater anatomical complexity than their polyp form. Adult medusa are on average 1 cm in diameter. They are almost entirely transparent, their gonads, radial canals, short stomach, and four-lipped mouth being their most clearly visible anatomical structures. Each medusa has four gonads positioned midway along each endodermal radial canal. The gonads themselves are transparent, allowing for visualization of the oocytes within. Each medusa typically has around 32 tentacles, each of which are covered in stinging nematocyte cells. These nematocytes are considered specialized nerve cells despite the fact that they are composed of a pressurized capsule (nematocyst), a rapid-firing, harpoon- like dart and lethal toxins made for killing prey. Clytia‚Äôs nervous system is well-organized and highly specialized. Two parallel condensed nerve rings run around the periphery of the medusa‚Äôs bell; the outer rings is responsible for integrating sensory inputs, while the inner ring coordinates motor responses. Specialized balance organs known as statocysts are also located between tentacles. Medusa also have both smooth and striated muscle that allows for the contractions necessary to swim smoothly through the water.  Research use  Since C. hemisphaerica passes through planula, polyp, and medusa stages during its life cycle, it is regarded as a good model for studying how one genome can produce variable phenotypes. This is especially useful when considering that two of the more common Cnidarian model organisms, Hydra and Nematostella, do not have the same ‚Äúcomplete‚Äô life-cycle that alternates between a vegetative polyp and sexually reproducing, free-swimming medusa form. Clytia has characteristics that make it favorable for laboratory culture and experimental manipulation. All stages of Clytia‚Äôs life cycle can be reproduced under laboratory conditions; polyp colonies, due to their essentially immortal nature, are easily maintained, and adult medusa can be fed with Artemia larvae. Adult male and female medusa spawn daily, and can be entrained with controlled light conditions to spawn at specific times. The oocytes, eggs, embryos, and planulae of Clytia are easily visualized under a microscope and, much like those of popular model organisms like sea urchins, the zygotes of C. hemisphaerica are relatively large (around 200 um in diameter) and can be microinjected to form transgenic planulae, polyp colonies, and medusa. Clytia is also unique in that its gonads can function autonomously; a gonad separated from an adult medusa will undergo oocyte development and ovulation under the same entrained light cues as would a gonad still attached to a medusa. Clytia medusa that are produced from a single polyp colony are also genetically identical, presenting a huge advantage for gene function analysis as well as genome sequencing. Cnidarians are known for their ability to rapidly heal and regenerate their tissues, a function that C. hemisphaerica also possesses. This makes Clytia an ideal candidate for studying the dynamics of tissue regeneration and epithelial wound-healing in- vivo, since the organism's small size allows its healing process be filmed under a microscope in real-time.

The 16 teams that take part in the championship are the 16 teams in the Senior Football League (SFL). Relegation from SFC: Either two or three teams are relegated each year from the SFC and SFL. The 16th placed team in the SFL is automatically relegated to the IFL. The 15th and 14th placed teams then play a SFL relegation playoff with the loser being relegated. The winner plays the winner of the IFL promotion playoffs - if they win, they remain in the SFC and SFL - if they lose they are relegated to the IFC and IFL. (The winner of the SFC can't be relegated. If the championship winner finishes in the bottom 3 in the league, the 13th placed team enters the relegation scenario.) Promotion to SFC: Either two or three teams are promoted to the SFC each year. The IFC champions and the IFL champions are automatically promoted to the senior grade (If a team wins the IFC and IFL, the 2nd placed team in the IFL are automatically promoted). 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th place in the IFL enter the IFL promotion semi-finals (If the IFC champions are placed in the top 5 the 6th placed team enter the IFL promotion semi-finals) with the eventual winner of the final earning the right to play the loser of the SFL relegation playoff in a relegation/promotion playoff.

Joy has studied lunar samples from the Apollo program as part of her research on meteorites and lunar science.  Early life and education  Joy was educated at Sackville School, East Grinstead and studied geology at Royal Holloway, University of London where she graduated with first class honours in 2003. Joy was a doctoral student at University College London working on the evolution of the moon supervised by Ian Crawford. Her work considered sample analysis and remote sensing. She held a joint position at the Natural History Museum, London. She was part of the European Space Agency (ESA) SMART-1 mission. In 2006 Joy joined Birkbeck, University of London where she used the Demonstration of a Compact Imaging X-ray Spectrometer (D-CIXS) instrument, part of the SMART-1 mission, to study X-ray fluorescence from lunar samples. D-CIXS was designed by the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) and could measure elemental abundances of magnesium, aluminium and silicon. Her work has used data from the Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer (MIXS) on the BepiColombo Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO). Research and career In 2007 Joy was appointed a postdoctoral research fellow at Birkbeck, where she performed mineralogical and geochemical investigations into lunar rock and used this to understand chemical information collected from remote sensing. In 2010 Joy joined the Johnson Space Center as a NASA Lunar Science Institute research fellow working on lunar regolith. By investigating the composition of lunar soil Joy hopes to understand the moon's bombardment history. Whilst in the United States Joy was a member of the Center for Lunar Science and Exploration. She moved to the Antarctic search for meteorites (ANSMET) in 2011, where she spent three months searching for lunar meteorites in the Miller Range in Antarctica. The Antarctic is well suited to the identification of meteorites; it is cold enough to preserve them but white enough for the dark meteorites to stand out. She led the first UK team to recover meteorite samples from Antarctica in collaboration with the British Antarctic Survey (BAS); the Polar Meteorite Exploration and Research programme. Over the course of four weeks, Joy's mission collected almost forty lunar meteorites from the ice. One of the 4.3 billion year old meteorites studied by Joy contained evidence of active volcanoes on Mars, a surprising finding that indicated volcanic activity started hundreds of millions of years before it had previously been estimated. Joy has studied the 382 kg of lunar rocks that were brought back from the Apollo missions. She believes that lunar rocks will hold answers to whether life exists beyond our solar system. Joy has called for future generation of space craft to be more careful about where they collect rocks. She found fragments of ancient asteroids in the rocks brought back by the Apollo 16 mission, which indicates that primitive asteroids regularly bombarded the moon over 3.4 billion years ago. Joy joined the University of Manchester in 2012, where she was awarded a Royal Society University Research Fellowship (URF) to study lunar meteorites. She is a member of the European Space Agency Package for Resource Observation and in-Situ Prospecting for Exploration, Commercial exploitation and Transportation (PROSPECT) drill ‚Äì the Sample Excavation and Extraction Device. = Public engagement = Joy has been involved with the development of Our Earth: Its Climate, History, and Processes, a University of Manchester programme available on Coursera that covers the formation of the moon and importance of the moon on Earth. In 2019 Joy appeared on The Life Scientific. She has written for The Conversation and appeared on The Sky at Night and at the Bluedot Festival. = Selected publication = Her publications include: * A petrological, mineralogical, and chemical analysis of the lunar mare basalt meteorite La Paz Icefield 02205, 02224, and 02226 * The petrology and geochemistry of Miller Range 05035: A new lunar gabbroic meteorite * Direct detection of projectile relics from the end of the lunar basin‚Äìforming epoch  References  Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Alumni of University College London Category:Alumni of Royal Holloway, University of London Category:British women physicists Category:Fellows of the Royal Astronomical Society Category:Academics of the University of Manchester Category:Space scientists Category:People educated at Sackville School, East Grinstead Category:British earth scientists Category:British women earth scientists Category:Planetary scientists Category:Women planetary scientists ","title":"Katherine Joy"},{"id":"62387817","title":"Heavy Is the Head (album)"},{"id":"62387828","text":"The Europe Zone was one of the three regional zones of the 1983 Davis Cup. 25 teams entered the Europe Zone in total, split across two sub-zones.
