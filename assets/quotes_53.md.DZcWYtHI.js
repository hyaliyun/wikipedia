When the Alliance for Democracy political party was formed in 1998, it took the Afenifere agenda as its official manifesto. Following a poor performance in the April 2003 elections, in late 2003 rival factions of the AD held separate conventions. In the Lagos convention, Adebisi Akande was elected as AD chairman. In January 2006, the convoy of AD leaders who supported Chief Mojisoluwa Akinfenwa as the party's national chairman was attacked by thugs in Osogbo, the capital of Osun State. In 2008, the Afenifere Renewal Group (alias ARG) was formed with the stated intent of reuniting the feuding factions, but perhaps as an alternative to the faction headed by the older generation of leaders. In November 2008, a faction of Afenifere in Ijebu Igbo, Ogun State, led by Chief Ayo Adebanjo, installed Chief Reuben Fasoranti as the new chairman of the group. ARG Leaders including Senator Olabiyi Durojaiye, Chief Bisi Akande, Wale Oshun and Yinka Odumakin stated that they did not accept the move. In October 2009, a spokesman for the ARG spoke out against plans to deregulate the domestic fuel market. That month, the ARG hailed the conviction of Chief Bode George and five others as an important step towards freeing Nigeria of corruption. A majority of the Yorubas see the pressure group as a legitimate force that is both serving their interests and maintaining the waning influence of Yorubaland in the Federation. They consider it to be a necessary body to preserve the ethnic identity of the Yorubas. Criticism There are some voices among the Yorubas that see the organization as a dangerous group. Responding to some questions by his followers at his London Awqaf Africa College, prominent Yoruba Muslim cleric Sheikh Dr. Abu-Abdullah Adelabu described Afenifere as a bunch of tribalists and self-serving ambitious, greedy rivals driven by xenophobia and deep bigotry, and possessed by a delusion of their so-called cultural commonalities. Sheikh Adelabu, who founded the Awqaf Africa Society in London, said the only logic behind the Yoruba socio-cultural organization is that Afenifere exhibits the very paranoia that has made the Nigerians so hopeless and the Yoruba politicians so careless.EsinIslam Hausa Networking References Category:Political organizations based in Nigeria Category:Yoruba people ","title":"Afenifere"},{"id":"25010600","text":"Vitaƒça was Queen consort of Bosnia as the first wife of King Stephen Ostoja of Bosnia.

The church of St Nicholas is one of the very few church buildings that is divided into two worship areas, a Roman Catholic area (the chancel) and an Anglican area (the nave and transepts). The chancel, the Fitzalan Chapel, is used as the private mausoleum of the Dukes of Norfolk. It is a Grade I listed building. The circular motte and keep of Arundel Castle in the foreground, St Nicholas' Church (with the Fitzalan Chapel) in the midground, and Arundel Roman Catholic Cathedral in the background Chapel view from castle gardens Interior view Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel, was responsible for the building of the Chapel posthumously according to his will. The original Fitzalan Chapel consisted of the entire building, and was built as the Collegiate Church of the Holy Trinity in 1380 by commission of Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel, whose family owned Arundel Castle. It is an example of Perpendicular Gothic architecture, and the architect and mason is believed to have been William Wynford. A number of noted Fitzalan and Howard family members are buried in the chapel, many in tombs adorned with sculpted effigies. Most of the recently deceased Dukes of Norfolk are buried there. The chapel was badly damaged in 1643 during the siege of Arundel Castle by the Parliamentarians' cannons during the English Civil War. It remained neglected throughout the 18th century. During this period, the Anglican parish was established in the western portion of the church building. Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk, is credited with initiating major repairs to the Fitzalan Chapel circa 1837, and his successors expanded and restored the chapel further. Fitzalan Chapel is now vested in an independent charitable trust (No. 279379), and accepts donations for further maintenance and preservation. It is currently open to the public by access from the castle grounds.

It is located in Kafr el-Sheikh Governorate east of Rosetta, bordered by the Mediterranean Sea in the north and agricultural land to the south. History In the early Islamic period, the port of Burullus was situated near the mouth of the lake (the place where it was connected to the sea through a small opening). Burullus port functioned as one of the defensive frontier settlements of the Nile Delta coast. An island settlement within the lake called Nastaru lent its name to the lake as a whole. Canals connected the lake to the Rosetta branch of the Nile. At this time the lake was growing and expanding southwards as a result of changes in fluvial deposition and generalized substrate subsidence. Geography Small island on Lake Burullus The lake is separated from the sea by a strip of land approximately wide. It is connected to the Mediterranean by the Burullus outlet, a channel about wide and deep. There are approximately 50 islands in the lake with a total area of . The lake's north shore is formed primarily of salt marshes and mudflats, while the south is mainly reed beds. The dominant lake vegetation is Potamogeton. Hydrology The lake receives drainage waters from surrounding agricultural land and fresh water from the Brembal Canal. It is considered to be a lake and wetlands site of International importance for birds under the Ramsar Convention. Agriculture drainage water accounts for 97% of the total inflow to the lake (3.9 billion m3 per year), followed by rain water (2%) and groundwater (1%). 16% of the lake's water evaporates and 84% flows to the sea. Wildlife Fishermen on Lake Burullus. According to a Biodiversity Report of the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency 33 species of fish, 23 species of reptiles, 112 species of birds, and 18 species of mammals live in and around the lake. Fish species declined from 52 recorded at the beginning of the 20th century, mostly due to the inflow of agricultural drainage into the lake resulting in lower salinity.Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency:Egypt State of the Environment Report 2007, Chapter on Biodiversity, 2008, accessed on November 8, 2009 References External links * * Ministry of Environment Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency - Natural Protectorates Description Category:National parks of Egypt Burullus Category:Kafr El Sheikh Governorate Category:Ramsar sites in Egypt Category:Nile Delta ","title":"Lake Burullus"},{"id":"25010666","text":"Geohumoral theory or Geohumoralism was a racialist concept propounded in Renaissance Europe.

He also edited the London newspaper The Westminster Gazette from 1896 to 1922. Early life Spender was the eldest of four sons born to John Kent Spender, a doctor, and his wife, the novelist Lillian Spender. He was educated at Bath College and Balliol College, Oxford, where he did well in his studies but missed a first in Greats because of illness. Editor Though Benjamin Jowett, the Master of Balliol, suggested for Spender to become a lawyer, Spender sought out a career in journalism instead and he had the assistance of his uncle, William Saunders, who owned the Western Morning News and Eastern Morning News as well as the Central News Agency. After a brief period as Saunders's secretary, Spender was offered a position as a leader writer for The Echo by John Passmore Edwards, but their relationship proved difficult and Spender left after only five months in the post.Morris 2004, p.900 In 1886 Saunders offered his nephew the editorship of the struggling Hull newspaper Eastern Morning News. Spender eagerly accepted and spent a little more than four years in the post. As the editor of a provincial daily, Spender undertook whatever jobs were necessary: sales manager, leader writer, reporter and critic. His efforts returned the paper to profitability, but it was sold by Saunders in February 1891. Spender returned to London, where he worked as a freelance contributor to a number of papers and wrote his first book, a tract on old-age pensions that won him the friendship of John Morley. In June 1892 Spender received an offer from Edward Tyas Cook, the editor of the Liberal evening newspaper the Pall Mall Gazette, to work as his assistant editor. Spender gladly accepted, only to be let go a month later after it was sold to William Waldorf Astor, who changed its party allegiance to the Unionists. Though the newly-married Spender was unemployed once more, he was quickly rehired by Cook when he started a new Liberal evening paper, The Westminster Gazette, in January 1893. Editorship of The Westminster Gazette Cook served as editor until 1896, when he resigned his position to take over as editor of the Liberal The Daily News. Though a number of prominent individuals applied to succeed him, the owner of The Westminster Gazette, George Newnes, decided to offer the editorship to Spender, then only 33. Spender himself was modest about his prospects, but his selection was met with approval by many in the Liberal ranks, including leader Lord Rosebery.Koss 1981. p.364 Under Spender's direction, The Westminster Gazette never had a wide circulation nor made a profit. Nonetheless, it was the most influential evening newspaper in Britain, and Spender received the credit. Veteran editor Frederick Greenwood regarded The Westminster Gazette under Spender as \\"the best edited paper in London\\"Koss 1981, p. 376. and his leaders became essential reading for politicians on both sides of the political aisle. His priority was Liberal unity, and he balanced ideological expression in the pages of his paper, avoiding the polemical heights attained by his counterparts in other Liberal publications. That occasionally earned him the ire of both Liberal factions in a debate, but his loyalty to the Liberal leadership was rewarded with their confidences, which provided him with invaluable insight into the inner workings of contemporary politics.Morris 2004, p.901 Spender greatly valued his editorial independence, which was never an issue with Newnes. When the latter sold the paper in 1908 to a consortium of Liberal businessmen and politicians, led by Alfred Mond, however, Spender found his cherished independence under pressure. Only internal disagreement within the consortium saved Spender from dismissal. The dispute hurt staff morale, and the start of the First World War led several important staff members to leave for service in the armed forces. A growing decline in circulation and revenue led Spender and the owners to undertake the radical move of switching from an evening to a morning publication in November 1921. The new paper, however, was no longer a vehicle for the sort of reflective journalism characteristic of Spender, who resigned in February 1922.Koss 1984, pp.338, 373‚Äì4 Later life Spender's departure from The Westminster Gazette also meant his departure from journalism, as he how pursued a new career as an author. Over the next two decades, he wrote a number of books on nonfiction subjects, including histories, travelogues, biographies and memoirs. His most prominent works were two biographies of Liberal Party Prime Ministers Henry Campbell-Bannerman and H. H. Asquith and a memoir of his Life Journalism and Politics. He also served on a number of public commissions and inquiries, and after refusing public honours three previous times, he accepted an appointment as a Companion of Honour. He also remained involved in Liberal politics, but his influence was much diminished with the decline of the Liberal Party in the interwar period. His concern about the insufficiency of British armaments led many to brand Spender as an appeaser before the Second World War, or otherwise to praise him for his able defence of Neville Chamberlain's policy. Spender died in June 1942 after a long illness.Morris 2004, p. 902 Works *The State and Pensions in Old Age (1892) *The Life of The Right Hon. Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman (2 vols.)

The first and most relevant of goals was intended to stimulate the economy by motivating Americans to replace their roofs with more energy efficient roofs, thereby creating jobs by increasing the demand for labor in the roofing, manufacturing, and construction industries. The other goal of the 2009 federal roofing tax credit was to reduce carbon emissions to the environment by requiring consumers to install Energy Star products on their homes in order to receive the tax credit; the installation of energy star roofing products in homes would reduce the consumption of electricity needed to maintain the desired temperature within the residence. Covered by the roofing tax credit To qualify for the tax credit, the new roofing materials was required to be metal with an appropriate pigmented coating or asphalt with cooling granules compliant with energy star requirements. The Environmental Protection Agency provided a list of some products which satisfy the tax credit's requirement, but consumers should also check with the manufacturer prior to purchase to ensure the materials qualify. The government has placed a restriction on the tax credit dictating that the new roof must be installed at the principal residence of the tax payer between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2010. Principal residence is defined as a home owned by the party filing for the credit and used as his principal place of residence. Principal residences can include houses, houseboats, mobile homes, cooperative apartments, condominiums, or manufactured homes. Amount of the credit The federal roofing tax credit for energy efficiency is dependent on the cost of the materials used in the renovation. A consumer could only receive a tax credit of up to 30% of the material cost to maximum of $1,500. This credit is for funds spent on the energy-star approved materials, not on installation or labor cost. For example, if the roofing materials cost $5,000 and labor expense was $5,000 resulting in a total cost of $10,000, a tax filer would still only receive the maximum tax credit of $1,500. The energy star difference It is an advisable idea to utilize materials that will reduce the heat of a homeowner's residence to reduce their energy consumption and their impact on the environment. But not all consumers will derive the same benefit from the use of a reflective heat-reducing roofs in reducing energy consumption. Reflective heat reduction roofing or a cool roof is most beneficial in hot sunny climates. If a home's roof is partially or completely shaded, the homeowner may not benefit as much as someone with in direct sunlight. However even if a homeowner's roof is shaded, they will still receive the tax credit, receive benefit of heat reduction roofing, and enjoy a high-quality environmentally friendly roof.

Between 1945 and 1952 he was the absolute leader of the State Protection Authority (√Ållamv√©delmi Hat√≥s√°g) which was responsible for much cruelty, brutality and many political purges. Early life Born Benjamin Eisenberger to P√©ter Eisenberger, a Jewish tailor, and R√≥za Meczner, in √öjfeh√©rt√≥, Hungary. During his early years he worked as a tailor. He took part in the labour movements from the early years of the 1920s. In 1931, he joined the Hungarian Communist Party. At this time he was also a lover of Litzi Friedmann the future first wife of Kim Philby, a member of the Cambridge Five. Career In January 1945, he was appointed as leader of the Budapest Police Main Command Political Department (PRO), the Hungarian secret police. P√©ter's career rose quickly then: he became leader of the Hungarian State Police State Protection Department (√ÅVO) then the State Protection Authority (√ÅVH). In 1952, he was discharged from his position because he was Jewish. Later he was arrested in M√°ty√°s R√°kosi's villa. According to historian Tibor Zinner, G√°bor P√©ter was present on an official visit. Unexpectedly a handcuff clicked on his hand put back. After that Mih√°ly Farkas stepped forward from behind the curtain and said: \\"the game is over\\". G√°bor P√©ter's wife, Jol√°n Simon, who served as R√°kosi's secretary, was also arrested. In 1954, a court martial sentenced him to life imprisonment. He was accused of being a Zionist spy who cooperated with L√°szl√≥ Rajk, Rudolf Sl√°nsk√Ω and other \\"agents of international Zionism\\". In 1957, his term of imprisonment was significantly reduced and in 1959, he was released. After that he worked as a librarian.

It is believed to be the earliest truly provincial English newspaper, although the London Gazette was briefly published in Oxford in 1665. History The printer Francis Burges set up a printing press at the Red Well in Norwich, England during the summer of 1701. He appears to have established a weekly newspaper from early November of that year (although the earliest surviving copy dates from 1707). Burges died in November 1706 and was succeeded by his widow Elizabeth, who continued the business despite competition from the newly established newspapers the Norwich Postman (December 1706) and the Norwich Gazette (January 1707). After Elizabeth Burges' death in November 1709, the newspaper reverted to Francis Burges' former master, the printer Freeman Collins of London. Collins sent his most trusted apprentices or members of his family to Norwich to print the newspaper. These included Edward Cave, later the founder of the Gentleman's Magazine. The newspaper continued until Collin's death in 1713, and thereafter it was superseded by the Norwich Courant.

It is designated by Cadw as a Grade I listed building. The chapel is one of the earliest Nonconformist chapels to be built in Wales, and is the only chapel existing from that time to be largely unchanged and still in use as a chapel. It is currently administered by the United Reformed Church. History In 1689 the Act of Toleration granted Nonconformists freedom to worship in their own buildings without certain legal strictures that had formerly applied. Maesyronnen Chapel was one of the earliest buildings in Wales to be created for this purpose. It was developed from an existing longhouse (a farmhouse with an attached cattle-shed), the cattle-shed being converted into a chapel and the farmhouse used by the caretaker. The conversion took place in the 1690s, either in 1691 or in 1696-97. It was registered as a chapel in 1697 and was used by a congregation which had been meeting in secret in a barn nearby since the 1640s. The chapel was built on land given by Charles Lloyd, squire of Maesllwch. The original farmhouse would have been a substantial building dating from the Elizabethan era. At some time it was replaced by a much smaller house, a chapel-house, for the minister. The original roof was replaced in the 18th century and the floor, formerly beaten earth, was flagged. In 1980 the chapel received a grant for repairs, having been recognised as a building of \\"outstanding architectural and historic importance\\" by the Historic Buildings Council. Further restoration and repair became necessary in the 21st century and Cadw gave a grant of ¬£50,000, following a recommendation from the Historic Buildings Advisory Council for Wales. The chapel re-opened for worship in the spring of 2008. Architecture Exterior The plan of the chapel is that of a simple rectangle, measuring about by . The small house is attached to its western side. It is built in stone, plastered and limewashed. The entrance front faces south and contains two doors, one at the western end, the other towards the eastern end. Between the doors are three mullioned windows with timber frames; there is another window beyond the east door. Over the west door and the most easterly window is a small gable. In the gable over the west door is a sundial. Interior The ceiling is barrel-vaulted, and divided into six bays. Much of the 18th-century furniture is still present in the chapel. The interior is dominated by the pulpit, that stands in the middle of the long wall opposite the entrance. Behind it is a window, which both provides light for the preacher, and surrounds him with a \\"halo\\". In front of the pulpit is a large table, two benches (which are dated 1728), and another table which is used for communion. The communion table is dated 1727. Also in the church are box pews, and some simple backless benches. On the walls are memorials dating from the early 19th century that include inscriptions in Latin. Present day The chapel is used by the United Reformed Church who hold services there every Sunday morning. It is accessible to wheelchair users and there is some limited parking for cars. The attached cottage is administered by the Landmark Trust and is available to be rented for holidays.

However, in the early 1900s, as the city's population began to increase, there was a demand for a permanent library structure. The town of Presque Isle applied for a gift/donation from the Andrew Carnegie Foundation; otherwise known as the Carnegie Corporation of New York. The request was granted giving the city $10,000 for the purchase of land and construction. After the initial land purchase of \\"$1,000 from Dudley Heirs, local citizens raised around $950 for the purchase of a smaller, adjoining plot of land\\". The library was opened in May 1908 under the name: Presque Isle Free Library. Presque Isle Free Library. By the 1960s, overcrowding in the library had become such a problem that it was acknowledged by patrons and officials of Presque Isle that the library needed to be expanded.

The episode aired on November 23, 2009. Plot This episode consists of three Thanksgiving dinners: the Petrellis', the Bennets' and the one at Samuel's carnival. It's Thanksgiving and Samuel Sullivan is preparing a feast with his family at the carnival. As Samuel watches the film Hiro Nakamura had retrieved for him in the previous episode, he is interrupted by Hiro, who demands to have Charlie Andrews released. Samuel tells him he still has some tasks for him to do, and will eventually release Charlie. Hiro angrily vents to Lydia about Samuel's deception, revealing he had gone to the past to retrieve the film. Lydia and Edgar then wonder why Samuel hadn't sent Hiro back to save Joseph as well, and Lydia asks Hiro to take her back to when Joseph was killed. Shortly after Mohinder Suresh had met with Joseph, Samuel, who had been eavesdropping, angrily confronted his brother about keeping the truth from him. Joseph asserts he is trying to protect Samuel, and tells him he has contacted a government agent to take Samuel in. In a fit of rage, Samuel kills Joseph by impaling him with a rock while Hiro and Lydia watch horrified. Returning to the present, Lydia and Hiro rejoin the others at the dinner table and Lydia informs Edgar of what they saw. Edgar angrily confronts Samuel in front of everyone, though Samuel attempts to accuse Edgar for Joseph's death. As he says this, Hiro notices that Samuel is about to kill Edgar, and he grabs Edgar's arm while stopping time. Edgar wishes to kill Samuel, but Hiro reminds him he needs Samuel alive to know where Charlie is. Hiro promises to put a stop to Samuel, while Edgar flees. Hiro then threatens to leave if Samuel doesn't release Charlie, knowing Samuel needs him. Samuel doesn't seem fazed, however, who then motions for Damien to come over. Touching Hiro's head, Damien causes a series of flashbacks from the past few episodes to appear in Hiro's head. Hiro is left stunned, and afterward Samuel asks him how he feels. Hiro then remarks \\"Must rescue Watson...Beam me up, Scotty\\" before vanishing, leaving Samuel shocked as Hiro disappears. Noah Bennet is preparing a Thanksgiving dinner at his apartment, and has invited Claire Bennet, his ex- wife Sandra and her new boyfriend Doug. While shopping, Noah runs into Lauren, his former partner at the company seen in the past episode, and invites her to come to his Thanksgiving dinner. At dinner, Claire reveals she is thinking of dropping out of college, feeling like she doesn't fit in, and Noah deduces that Claire must be thinking about joining Samuel, who he feels is dangerous. Their arguing escalates, causing Claire to snap and purposefully cut herself when Doug tries to interject. Doug faints after seeing the wound heal, breaking up the dinner. Noah shows Claire his investigation with Samuel, warning her his group is dangerous, while Claire tells Noah to stop treating her like a child. They are then interrupted by a knock at the door, which Noah opens to reveal Gretchen. Gretchen reveals Noah had invited her to come to dinner to cheer Claire up, and the two make up from their past falling out. Claire promises Noah she'll continue with her classes, while Noah and Lauren plan on a movie date. Gretchen prepares to give Claire a ride back to her dorm, but Claire reveals she has taken the compass that Noah had found, and intends to follow it to Samuel. Angela Petrelli is also attempting to have a Thanksgiving dinner with her sons Peter Petrelli and Nathan Petrelli, though the brothers are more concerned with what she knows about Nathan's death and Sylar. Angela confirms much of what they already know, and also asserts her decision as a mistake, and that they should just live with the outcome and pretend like nothing happened. Nathan begins saying how they will always see him as Sylar, and Angela realizes that Sylar has returned to his body. Nathan then begins exhibiting electrical arcs, and finally reverts to Sylar's form. Sylar uses his telekinesis to force the two to sit at the table while he remarks on how evil the deed that Angela had performed. As Sylar begins to slice Angela's head open, he stops, and Peter realizes that Nathan is fighting for control. Nathan eventually gains control and, after asking Angela what she's done with him, flies off through a window. Peter promises his mother he'll find a way to stop Sylar and have his brother alive.

Early years Born in Berwickshire, Black's father was Ebenezer Black, a farm worker and former peddler who had married a co-worker on the farm, Janet Gray. Ebenezer Black died four years after they were married, leaving Janet to raise both a son and a daughter by herself. Within a decade, both Black's mother and sister had died as well. He was taken in by his uncle, also a worker on the farm, who sent him to the parish school at Duns before articling him out to a local writer. During this time, Black read extensively from the local subscription library and began a book collection that would become a major preoccupation of his life. After a brief period as a clerk for the British Linen Bank, Black went to work for an accountant in Edinburgh. In his spare time he attended classes at the University of Edinburgh and he undertook such literary work as translating German for David Brewster Edinburgh Encyclop√¶dia. During this time, he met William Mudford, who became a close friend and important associate. When Mudford moved to London and became editor of Universal Magazine, Black contributed articles on Italian drama and German literature. In 1809, Black became engaged (probably a Miss Birkett of Carlisle), but he subsequently broke it off, leading to a change in behavior that worried his friends and cost Black his job. Persuaded by Mudford to join him in London, Black traveled there with a letter of introduction to Robert Cromek, who welcomed him into his home. Within three months of his arrival, Black found employment as a reporter and translator for James Perry. In December 1812 he married Elizabeth Frances 'Fanny' Cropley, the mistress of a London friend William Fisher; the union was short and loveless, and she plagued Black financially for years afterward. John Black did have a son Charles William Black 1813-1876 by Fanny, but soon after the marriage failed, he began a long-lasting common-law relationship with Anne Cromek. Editor of The Morning Chronicle Black was employed by Perry as a reporter for The Morning Chronicle. In 1817, a worsening illness led Perry to turn over the editorial duties to Black. As editor, Black maintained the paper's opposition to the Tory government of the time, condemning its handling of the Peterloo Massacre in 1819. Yet he came out against Queen Caroline during her trial in 1820, a stance that precipitated a drop in the newspaper's circulation. Black remained as editor after the paper was purchased by William Innell Clement in 1821, though the paper continued to decline especially as it faced growing competition from The Times for whig subscribers. When Clement sold the paper to Sir John Easthope in 1834, the circulation was down to only 800 copies a day.Stephen Koss, The Rise and Fall of the Political Press in Britain, vol. 1: The Nineteenth Century (Chapel Hill, North Carolina: University of North Carolina Press, 1981), p. 75. Yet it soon rose to over 9,000, aided in part by the decision of The Times the following year to shift its political stance to support for Robert Peel's administration, a move that led many subscribers to abandon it in favor of Black's pro-Whig paper. When Peel was succeeded by Lord Melbourne, Black enlisted his pen in the service of the Whig government, writing numerous articles supporting its policies and attacking Peel. Among the reporters he employed during this period was a young Charles Dickens, who later referred to Black as \\"my first hearty out-and-out appreciator\\".The Letters of Charles Dickens, Graham Storey, ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), v. 12, p. 539. Retirement By 1843, Black's energy was failing him, and Easthope sought to replace him with his son-in-law Andrew Doyle, the Chronicles foreign editor. Lacking any retirement savings, Black was forced to part with his library of 30,000 books, which he had lovingly and painstakingly accumulated over the years. Its sale, along with the additional efforts of his friends and a contribution by Easthope, provided an annuity of ¬£150. His friend Walter Coulson lent him a cottage in Snodland, where he spent the remaining years of his life gardening and studying the Greek language. Black died at Birling, Kent, in 1855.

The Dinner and Ball in honour of Count and Countess De Nord. Teatro San Benedetto, 22nd January 1782 Set design by Francesco Bagnara for the production of L'italiana in Algeri at the Teatro San Benedetto in 1826 The Teatro San Benedetto was a theatre in Venice, particularly prominent in the operatic life of the city in the 18th and early 19th centuries. It saw the premieres of over 140 operas, including Rossini's L'italiana in Algeri, and was the theatre of choice for the presentation of opera seria until La Fenice was built in 1792. History The small, elegant theatre was first constructed by Michele Grimani on land owned by the Venier family. It was inaugurated on 26 December 1755 with a performance of Gioacchino Cocchi's opera Zoe. In 1766 the ownership of the San Benedetto passed from Grimani to a consortium of patrician families in Venice who had been box holders at the theatre. The original design of the theatre was circular. However it was rebuilt in the traditional horseshoe shape following a fire in 1773. In 1765 Vincenzo Galeotti who danced here from 1761 became the ballet master of the theatre and staged his first ballet here (at that time besides Galeotty and his wife Antonia there were two soloists and 16 corps de ballet dancers in the company). In 1772‚Äî1773 the ballet master of San Benedetto was Gasparo Angiolini. In 1782 Teatro San Benedetto hosted the ball in honour of Count and Countess De Nord, Russian prince Pavel Petrovich and his spouse, visiting Venice. In 1786 the owners' consortium had to cede the theatre to the Venier family following a lawsuit, and later went on to build La Fenice. The theatre then became the Teatro Venier (or Teatro Venier in San Benedetto). In 1810, the ownership passed to the impresario Giovanni Gallo, and for a time it was known as the Teatro Gallo. His sons, who had inherited the theatre in 1847, renamed it Teatro Rossini in 1868 in honour of Gioachino Rossini whose operas L'italiana in Algeri and Eduardo e Cristina had premiered there earlier in the century, but by then its glory days as an opera house were over. In 1937 the building was completely remodelled as a movie theater, the Cinema Rossini, with a new facade by the Italian architect Carlo Scarpa. The cinema was closed in 2007 and underwent restoration in 2010 in a project financed by the City of Venice.

His dam was Lord Derby's foundation mare and 1896 Epsom Oaks winner Canterbury Pilgrim who also produced Chaucer, the 1927 and 1933 Leading broodmare sire in Great Britain & Ireland. Racing career Lord Derby died in June 1908 and his son Edward took over the family's racing and breeding operations. Trained by George Lambton at the Stanley House Stables in Newmarket, Suffolk, Swynford was a difficult horse to handle and in his only start at age two ran unplaced. An injury kept him off the track until 1910 when he made his three-year-old debut in The Derby. He finished well back in the Derby after being struck in the leg by another runner. Following a third in the St. James's Palace Stakes at Ascot Racecourse, Swynford then won the first of two consecutive editions of Ascot's Hardwicke Stakes. The colt went on to win the Liverpool Summer Cup and the third leg of the British Triple Crown, the St. Leger Stakes, somewhat fortuitously since \\"half the racegoers in England declared... [the race] had been thrown away by Danny Meher on Lemberg\\" Sent back to the track at age four, Swynford won the Chippenham Plate, Princess of Wales's Stakes, Eclipse Stakes and his second straight Hardwicke Stakes. In September 1911, he suffered a serious fetlock injury during training that almost ended his life. Saved by the work of a veterinarian, Swynford was retired to stud duty for Lord Derby where he would prove to be a very successful sire and a sire of leading sires.

The gunman killed one person and wounded six others before taking his own life with a gunshot to the head. Law enforcement officials ruled it was a premeditated attack after finding notes indicating Abu Kamal's anger over Palestine and Israel. At the time, Abu Kamal's widow stated the shooting spree was not politically motivated, but rooted in his despondency over financial ruin. Ten years after the shooting, Abu Kamal's daughter revealed that she had lied in hiding that her father's actions had in fact been motivated by Palestinian nationalism. Her mother's 1997 account was a cover story fabricated by the Palestinian Authority as Abu Kamal sought revenge against the Americans, the British, and the French for supporting Israel. Shooting Abu Kamal opened fire shortly after 5 p.m. on February 23, 1997, on the 86th floor observation deck of the Empire State Building, one of New York City's most popular tourist attractions. Before he started shooting, he muttered something about Egypt, apparently shouting, \\"Are you from Egypt?\\" The NYPD said they did not know whether it was said in an effort to spare or identify potential victims. Surviving victims however witness that Abu Kamal asked them in a friendly way whether \\"you are Italian or American?\\" before the shooting started. The shooter used a 14-shot .380-caliber Beretta 84 handgun that he apparently bought in Florida at the end of January 1997.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1997/02/25/shooter- bought-gun-by-using-new-florida-id/8bfb87f6-da54-4422-960c-3ad4bf5dc433/ Abu Kamal killed one person and wounded another six before shooting himself in the head. He was taken to a hospital where he died five hours later. The sole murder victim was 27-year-old Christoffer Burmeister, a Danish musician who was living in New York and played in a band. He was visiting the Empire State Building with bandmate Matthew Gross, who was critically wounded in the attack. Assailant The shooter Ali Hassan Abu Kamal was a 69-year-old Palestinian English teacher. He was born in Jaffa in Mandate Palestine on September 19, 1927. He was the son of a refugee family that fled the city during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and resettled in Gaza. He became a well- respected English teacher at a local high school and a university, and he was also a well-paid tutor and accomplished translator. He earned about $3,000 a month and lived in an affluent neighborhood with his wife, and had six children. In 1996, he decided his family should relocate to the United States for a better life. He obtained a legal nonimmigrant visa and arrived in New York on December 24, 1996. Motive According to law enforcement officials, Abu Kamal's attack was premeditated, based on his visit to the observation deck the day before the shooting. A pair of identical letters, one in English and one in Arabic, was also found in a pouch around his neck. The letters were a diatribe against the \\"Big Three\\" of the United States, France, and England for their mistreatment of Palestinians, as well as against Zionism, which he said oppressed Palestinians. Despite the letter's reference to Palestine and Zionists, Abu Kamal's widow offered another explanation that the real motive for the shooting spree was not political but rooted in financial ruin. The letter had also named two business partners, who Abu Kamal claimed swindled him out of money, losing $300,000 in a business venture. At that point, she said he became suicidal. His daughter added that he could not return home after losing the money. Fathiya Abu Kamal told the press: > My husband is not a terrorist, he was just hopeless. He was aged, he had > nothing to do with politics, or terrorism, or crime. In February 2007, 10 years after the shooting, the New York Daily News reported that Abu Kamal's daughter, Linda, was \\"tired of lying\\" about her father's motives for the attack. She told the Daily News that her father wanted to punish the U.S. for supporting Israel and revealed that her mother's 1997 account was a cover story fabricated by the Palestinian Authority: > A Palestinian Authority official advised us to say the attack was not for > political reasons because that would harm the peace agreement with Israel. > We didn't know that he was martyred for patriotic motivations, so we > repeated what we were told to do... His goal was patriotic. He wanted to > take revenge from the Americans, the British, the French and the Israelis... > He wrote that after he raised his children and made sure that his family was > all right he decided to avenge in the highest building in America to make > sure they get his message.

It was based on the 1976 novel of the same name by Richard Price. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Premise Set in a working-class Bronx community, it tells the story of the De Coco family, a family of construction workers. Thomas is the head of the family with two sons, but one, Stony (Richard Gere) wants to be a teacher, not a construction worker. Then he accepts a job as a recreational assistant at a children's ward.

As one of the De Coco sons, Richard Gere was especially praised. The film also introduced Marilu Henner. Ryan McDonald of Shameless Self Expression said: \\"This 1978 Robert Mulligan tale about a seriously dysfunctional Italian-American family is too broadly played, stereotyped, and overly familiar... This is all very shouty and somewhat overbearing stuff for a story that isn‚Äôt all that memorable to begin with. ... Tony Lo Bianco and especially an unrestrained Lelia Goldoni are the worst offenders. Lo Bianco, often typecast as (an) Italian-American hood, gives us a stereotype of Italian-American machismo, misogyny, occasional brutality, and just general hamminess. Occasionally there seems to be a real character in there, but largely it‚Äôs just too much of a ‚Äòperformance‚Äô... But at least he has his moments, which cannot be said for the ghastly Goldoni, whose shrieking, mugging, wailing ... coupled with a pathetic, basically psychotic character derail the film. ...

Plot summary  Kay is the widow of a Broadway showman called Jolly, who died after falling down a staircase at their home. Kay is now planning to remarry, to a stuffed-shirt named Rupert, and they live in the same house. Suddenly Jolly returns to her life as a ghost. Seen only by her, Jolly meddles in Kay's affairs and causes her mother and others to question her state of mind. On a romantic weekend in the country together, Kay and Rupert are accompanied by Jolly, who is annoyed by Rupert's pretending to be able to see and hear him. The situation comes to a head back at the house, where a colleague of Rupert's attempts to stage an exorcism. Jolly, finally convinced that Kay will be okay without him, kisses her goodbye for good.

The leads aren't great either. Miss Fields is neither Sonia Braga nor Irene Dunne and Mr. Caan, who appears to be imitating Gene Kelly, can't.

Lester and starring Robert Forster.STUNTS Monthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 47, Iss. 552, (Jan 1, 1980): 77. it was the very first film produced by New Line Cinema. Premise The film opens on an unseen figure tampering with a helicopter harness. The next morning, stuntman Greg Wilson wakes up in bed next to a blonde woman. He rides his motorcycle to the set, late for a shoot. In the stunt, he is the passenger in a skiing car. He climbs out the window and grabs onto the skid of a helicopter, which climbs to a great height. During the ascent, Greg tries to attach his harness, but finds that the hook will not close. He loses his grip and falls to his death. His brother Glen arrives on the set with reporter B.J. Parswell in tow. She is there to write about the dangers of stunt work. The producer of the film, Alvin Blake, introduces Glen to his wife Judy and asks him to join the production. He reluctantly agrees. Judy later comes onto Glen, revealing that she was sleeping with Greg and wants to see if his brother is as much fun in bed. Glen turns her down. Meanwhile Glen joins the film's stunt team. They are a close-knit group that promise each other they would pull the plug on each other if they are ever left in a vegetative state. Patti & Chuck Johnson are married members of the team, and they are beginning to think about having a baby. After Patti tells Chuck that she has stopped taking birth control, he loses his nerve on a 6-story fall he is supposed to take off a roof. Chuck asks Glen to switch places with him, and he takes Greg's place on the stunt team that is climbing up the building during the scene. As Glen is on the roof, shooting at the climbers during the scene, Chuck's harness fails, and he plummets to the ground. Hospitalized in a vegetative state, a tearful Glen pulls the plug on Chuck. Realizing the tampered harness was meant for him, Glen promises B.J. that he will get revenge. In a stunt where he is supposed to emerge from a burning building while completely on fire, stuntman Paul is inside the building lighting it on fire for the shot. As he tries to exit, an unseen figure traps him inside, leading to his death. On the day that Glen is to recreate the helicopter stunt that killed Greg, B.J. discovers that Blake is responsible for the murders. He is jealous of his wife's infidelity. She rushes to the set to stop the stunt, but it is already in progress. Blake flees in his convertible. He has loosened the skid on the helicopter, and it is starting to fall off as Greg hangs from it. B.J. tells him over the radio that Blake is the murderer. Glen directs the helicopter to hover over Blake's car. He jumps into it, just as the helicopter skid finally breaks free. Glen wrestles with Blake and jumps free of the car, just before it crashes and bursts into flames, killing Blake. Cast * Robert Forster as Glen Wilson * Fiona Lewis as B.J.

The most common instances of this are sun gods and moon gods in polytheistic systems worldwide. Also notable is the association of the planets with deities in Babylonian, and hence in Greco-Roman religion, viz. Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. The term astro-theology is used in the context of 18th- to 19th-century scholarship aiming at the discovery of the original religion, particularly primitive monotheism. Unlike astrolatry, which usually implies polytheism, frowned upon as idolatrous by Christian authors since Eusebius, astrotheology is any \\"religious system founded upon the observation of the heavens\\",OED, citing Derham (1714) as the first attestation of the term. and in particular, may be monotheistic. Gods, goddesses, and demons may also be considered personifications of astronomical phenomena such as lunar eclipses, planetary alignments, and apparent interactions of planetary bodies with stars. Astro- theology is used by Jan Irvin, Jordan Maxwell and Andrew Rutajit (2006) in reference to \\"the earliest known forms of religion and nature worship\\", advocating the entheogen theory of the origin of religion. Etymology Astrolatry comes from Greek ·ºÑœÉœÑœÅŒøŒΩ astron, \\"star\\" and the suffix -ŒªŒ¨œÑœÅŒ∑œÇ, itself related to ŒªŒ¨œÑœÅŒπœÇ latris, \\"worshipper\\" or ŒªŒ±œÑœÅŒµœçŒµŒπŒΩ latreuein, \\"to worship\\" from ŒªŒ¨œÑœÅŒøŒΩ latron, \\"payment\\". History Babylonian astronomy from early times associates stars with deities, but the heavens as the residence of an anthropomorphic pantheon, and later of monotheistic God and his retinue of angels, is a later development, gradually replacing the notion of the pantheon residing or convening on the summit of high mountains. Sayce (1913) argues a parallelism of the \\"stellar theology\\" of Babylon and Egypt, both countries absorbing popular star-worship into the official pantheon of their respective state religions by identification of gods with stars or planets.Archibald Henry Sayce, The religion of ancient Egypt, Adamant Media Corporation, 1913, 237f. Astrolatry does not appear to have been common in the Levant prior to the Iron Age, and becomes popular under Assyrian influence. The Sabaeans were notorious for their astrolatry, for which reason the practice is also known as \\"Sabaism\\" or \\"Sabaeanism\\". Similarly, the Chaldeans came to be seen as the prototypical astrologers and star-worshippers by the Greeks. The term astro- theology appears in the title of a 1714 work by William Derham, Astro- theology: or, A demonstration of the being and attributes of God, from a survey of the heavens based on the author's observations by means of \\"Mr. Huygens' Glass\\". Derham thought that the stars were openings in the firmament through which he thought he saw the Empyrean beyond.Michael J. Crowe, Modern theories of the universe: from Herschel to Hubble, Courier Dover Publications, 1994, , p. 67. The 1783 issue of The New Christian's magazine had an essay entitled Astro-theology which argued the \\"demonstration of sacred truths\\" from \\"a survey of heavenly bodies\\" in the sense of the watchmaker analogy. Edward Higginson (1855) argues a compatibility of \\"Jewish Astro-theology\\" of the Hebrew Bible, which places God and his angelic hosts in the heavens, with a \\"Scientific Astro-theology\\" based on observation of the cosmos. Manly P Hall (1901‚Äì1990), mystic and a 33rd degree mason, taught that each of the three Abrahamic faiths has a planet that governs that religion. Judaism is Saturn: the symbol of Judaism is a hexagram symbol of Saturn, and the day of worship is on Saturday, day of Saturn. Christianity is the Sun: the symbol of Christianity is the cross symbol of the Sun, and the day of worship is Sunday, day of the Sun. Islam is Venus: the symbol of Islam is the star and crescent (the star commonly thought to represent Venus), and the day of worship is on Friday. Prohibition in Abrahamic religions The Hebrew Bible contains repeated reference to astrolatry. Thus, Deuteronomy 4:19, 17:3 contains a stern warning against worshipping the sun, moon, stars or any of the heavenly host. Relapse into worshipping the host of heaven, i.e. the stars, is said to have been the cause of the fall of the kingdom of Judah in II Kings 17:16. King Josiah in 621 BC is recorded as having abolished all kinds of idolatry in Judah, but astrolatry was continued in private (Zeph. 1:5; Jer. 8:2, 19:13). Ezekiel (8:16) describes sun-worship practiced in the court of the temple of Jerusalem, and Jeremiah (44:17) claims that even after the destruction of the temple, women in particular insisted on continuing their worship of the \\"queen of heaven\\". Augustine of Hippo criticized sun- and star-worship in De Vera Religione (37.68) and De civitate Dei (5.1‚Äì8). Pope Leo the Great also denounced astrolatry, and the cult of Sol Invictus, which he contrasted with the Christian nativity. Despite such prohibitions, Dorothy M. Murdock, a proponent of the study,Maurice Casey Jesus: Evidence and Argument or Mythicist Myths? T&T; Clark 2014 p21-22 has released books on the subject and teaches the connections between the solar allegory and the life of Christ. She also goes beyond the astronomical comparisons and postulates ties between the origins of many of the early Abrahamic religions to ancient mythologies of that in Egypt, Rome, and Greece. The Qur'an contains strong prohibitions against astrolatry. Strong prohibition of Astrolatry is mentioned in the Quran through Prophet Abrahim observation of celestial bodies whose worship was common in Babylonian religion of that time. Below is the reference from Al- Quran, Surah Anaam, chapter 6, verses 75‚Äì80 75\\\\. Thus did we show Ibrahim (Abraham) the kingdom of the heavens and the earth that he be one of those who have Faith with certainty. 76\\\\. When the night covered him over with darkness he saw a star. He said: \\"This is my lord.\\" But when it set, he said: \\"I like not those that set.\\" 77\\\\. When he saw the moon rising up, he said: \\"This is my lord.\\" But when it set, he said: \\"Unless my Lord guides me, I shall surely be among the erring people.\\" 78\\\\. When he saw the sun rising up, he said: \\"This is my lord. This is greater.\\" But when it set, he said: \\"O my people!

Jos√© Ferrer stars as Giorgi Papashvily, who emigrates from Georgia in the Soviet Union to the United States and gradually becomes Americanized. Based on a 1945 best-selling biographical novel by Helen and George Papashvily, the film also stars Jose Ferrer and Kim Hunter, fresh from her Oscar-winning turn in A Streetcar Named Desire. Plot The film follows Papashvily from his arrival and initial immigrant inspection on Ellis Island, through his early jobs on New York's bustling Lower East Side. His friend, Nuri (Kurt Kasznar), who had arrived in New York earlier and speaks English, leads the way, telling Giorgi that he'll help him get an outdoor job with plenty of fresh air. Instead, they find themselves carrying buckets and pouring hot tar on rooftops. Giorgi, who didn't speak a word of English when he arrived, works diligently to learn the language, practicing troublesome consonants (\\"W\\" and \\"V\\") in the mirror. He also shares a house with fellow Georgians. Cited by the police with some of his fellow countrymen for picking flowers in Central Park, he refuses to pay the fine because he didn't pick the flowers (although he was present) and it would be wrong to admit to a crime he did not commit. Appearing before the judge on principle, he explains what happened. The judge, taken by his honesty and obvious character, finds him not guilty after the arresting police officer admits that he didn't actually see Giorgi pick any flowers. The judge shakes Giorgi's hand, thanking him for brightening his courtroom. Giorgi has also caught the eye of the pretty court reporter, Helen Watson (Kim Hunter), who is equally moved by Giorgi's simple but eloquent defense. She invites him over to her house because her hobby is recording folk music and she wants Giorgi to identify some music. It turns out that Giorgi has a pretty good voice as well. A fast but proper friendship develops between Helen and Giorgi. Helen has also recorded another musician who turns out to be Georgi's \\"Uncle John\\" (Oscar Beregi, Sr.) a friend from the old country and now a chef in New York, who Giorgi has been looking for since his arrival. Giorgi moves into Uncle John's house which he shares with a colorful group of fellow Georgian emigres. Giorgi dreams of becoming a U.S. citizen and noticing the hints from Helen (she calls him \\"darling\\"), also dreams of marrying her. But he lacks a bit of self- confidence in the area of romance. A few comic scenes ensue, notably one about an expanding loaf of dough, which Nuri understandably mispronounces as \\"duff\\" (i.e. \\"enough,\\" \\"rough\\") There are further scenes of immigrant life. Just when Giorgi is about to reveal his feelings for Helen, at the behest of Uncle John, she announces that she needs to go to California to look after a sick aunt who raised her. She promises to be back shortly. She leaves Giorgi with a plant to take care of for her. Weeks turn into months and Uncle John encourages Giorgi to go out to California. When he hesitates, Uncle John quits his job at the restaurant and announces he is going to California and asks Giorgi if he would like to come. Soon the whole household picks up and decamps to Southern California, where they connect with a reclusive fellow Georgian. Meanwhile, something appears to have changed with Helen, who has taken a job. Giorgi purchases a house and farm he can't afford and becomes an orange tree farmer. He still hasn't asked Helen to marry him. She confesses to her bedridden aunt that she doesn't feel a cold chill down her back with Giorgi and doesn't want to marry anyone until she is sure. The aunt discourages Helen's romanticism, telling her that she can get that chill from a cold shower. A past romance is discussed, which apparently didn't end well. A frost comes and threatens to ruin the orange crop. Helen rushes out to the farm and orders everyone to stop standing around and to light fires to keep the crop warm. Giorgi, deeply moved, asks Helen to marry him. She immediately says yes. Nuri and his friends arrive in a car from New York and Giorgi reveals the news. Uncle John becomes ill and a judge gives him a citizenship test and he becomes a citizen, dying shortly thereafter.

Furthermore, they are strung together in such a loose and senseless way and are played with such calculated cuteness that the monotony of them palls.\\" Variety called it \\"a heart-warming comedy, engagingly acted, slickly produced and directed.\\" \\"A pleasant, heart- warming comedy-drama,\\" agreed Harrison's Reports. \\"Much of the picture's charm and warmth stems from the sympathetic characterizations, particularly that of Jose Ferrer, who does an outstanding job as the immigrant.\\" John McCarten of The New Yorker called the film \\"somewhat superficial,\\" adding, \\"There are funny scenes, and if broken English amuses you, you might find more of the film palatable than I did. However, I'm afraid things go entirely too sweetly for this immigrant to make for much suspense, and the accent Jos√© Ferrer uses in the role of the hero makes him sound more Chinese than Georgian.\\" References External links * Category:1952 films Category:1952 comedy- drama films Category:American films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films about immigration to the United States Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by George Seaton Category:Films scored by Victor Young Category:Films set in California Category:Films set in New York City Category:Georgian-American culture Category:Paramount Pictures films ","title":"Anything Can Happen"},{"id":"25011263","text":"The Hook is a 1963 Korean War war film directed by George Seaton based on the 1957 novel L'Hamecon by Vah√© Katcha.Vahe Katcha (1928 - 2003) from the Armenian Cultural Association of Marne-la-Vall√©e (France) [translated].

History Official logo Woerth was entrusted with several missions and reforms to be led. The main reforms were to modify the statute of civil servants, to reduce the number of civil servants, to merge the taxation direction and the public compatibility services, to lead a general review of public policies, to reduce the budget deficit, to elaborate a new legislation on online bets. Budget Minister J√©r√¥me Cahuzac was reattached to the Ministry of the Economy and Finance in 2012; the ministry took its current name and was reestablished again in 2017. It is housed at Bercy, sharing the Economy and Finance Ministry's building on the Seine. In the government of Prime Minister Jean Castex, Minister for Public Accounts is a junior title held by Olivier Dussopt. Although the officeholder is present at the Council of Ministers, he is administratively attached to the Minister of the Economy, Finance and Recovery, Bruno Le Maire.

The book also includes Asterix stories which were created jointly with Ren√© Goscinny. The album, which celebrates the 50th anniversary of the creation of the series, was released on 22 October 2009. The album begins with a preface where Uderzo replies to the critics of his solo work, especially for the previous album, Asterix and the Falling Sky. He also says The Golden Book is not a whole story, but a succession of short stories celebrating the 50th anniversary of the hero.  Synopsis The story begins in the year 1 AD, when all the other books are set. The characters are introduced, but aged fifty years. Some craftsmen, tradesmen or Gallic warriors already have children or grandchildren. Uderzo appears in the strip and has a joke at the Gauls' expense, leading Obelix to hit him. Uderzo then decides that ageing the Gauls 50 years was not such a good idea. Back in 50 BC, in the same village in which the birthdays of Asterix and Obelix, which happen to be the same day, are celebrated. Asterix and Obelix receive letters from their friends (Panacea, the pirates, and Edifis among others). Obelix can't read Panacea's letter, so he gets an old alphabet book from Getafix. However, he is still unable to understand what the letter says, until Asterix helped him, and Obelix, in his anger, then threw the alphabet book to Getafix. Then Geriatrix, jealous of the two Gauls, criticises them and makes a rather negative description using a Magnetic resonance imaging picture. At a great feast, many recurring or important characters of the adventures of Asterix, from all nationalities, appear. Each one of them offers his gift to the hero (Ekonomikrisis offers a guide Coquelus, Cacofonix his sheet music, Valueaddedtax new magic potions ...) They also made some proposals for the future (clothes changing, marriage, amusement park, theater, art visual, etc., which are shown to the Gauls). Finally, Cleopatra and Julius Caesar arrive. Caesar is reluctant to come to the birthday party when they were both invited. However, he yielded to the wishes of his lady, who reminded him of the protection Asterix and Obelix gave to Caesarion (Asterix and Son). nevertheless, Caesar, being a bad loser, decides to offer the Gauls a jar of wine laced with Ricin ahead of their arrival. However, Getafix manages to outsmart this move, as the centurions, to whom he had entrusted the mission, drank the wine supposedly as a toast to Caesar's health, giving them the runs.

Goals  Lian Yu and Zhang Yintang felt that publishing a newspaper in the vernacular language would advance their administrative reforms far more than just making speeches to restricted audiences. They took the Sichuan Yun Bao and other government-funded newspapersd as its models.Bai Runsheng, The earliest Tibetan newspaper in Tibet , China Tibet Information Center, 2005-07-01: \\"But in Tibet the old customs had taken such a deep root that it was difficult to get effective results through administrative reformation. So Lian Yu and Zhang Yintang thought that to publish a newspaper in the vernacular language would get better results than to make speeches in narrow spheres. This was why they founded the \\"Vernacular Paper in Tibet.\\" Aiming at educating people in patriotism and intelligence. The paper took \\"Xun Bao\\", a newspaper of Sichuan, and other government-funded newspaper of other provinces as its models, It was the first modern newspaper in Tibetan areas.\\" As few Tibetans could read Chinese and few Chinese could read Tibetan at the time, they plumped for a bilingual newspaper. According to Bai Runsheng, the newspaper was warmly welcomed by the Tibetan people.Bai Runsheng, op. cit.: \\"At that time few Tibetans knew Chinese, and the same was true for the Chinese. So the newspaper was published in Tibetan and Chinese. The bilingual newspaper was warmly welcomed by the Tibetan people. It was said that many readers came to buy the newspaper.\\"  Printing, circulation and frequency  The Tibet Vernacular Paper was first printed lithographically (at the rate of fewer than 100 copies a day) on a stone printing machine brought to Tibet by Zhang Yintang.Xinhua, Protection and Development of Tibetan Culture (White Paper), China Daily, 25-09-2008, p. 7:\\"Old Tibet had only one lithographically printed newspaper in the Tibetan language in the last years of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), titled The Tibet Vernacular Newspaper, and its print-run was fewer than 100 copies a day.\\" In order to achieve larger print runs, printing machines were later bought in India and brought to Tibet.Bai Runsheng, op. cit.: \\"The first issue of the paper was printed with the stone printing machine brought to Tibet by the deputy amban Zhang Yintang. In order to run the newspaper for long, Lian Yu sent men to Calcutta to buy printing machines.\\" The newspaper appeared once every ten days, with 300 to 400 copies per issue.Bai Rusheng, op. cit.: \\"The \\"Vernacular Paper in Tiber\\" was a publication appearing once every ten days, with 300 to 400 copies per issue.\\" It stopped appearing in 1911.  Announcing the arrival of Zhao Erfeng army  Tibetan historian K. Dhondup wrote that one of the first issue of the newspaper was published while the 13th Dalai Lama came back to Lhasa after his first exile, just before his second exile. The paper announced in August 1909 the arrival of Chao Erh-feng army: \\"Don't be afraid of Amban Chao and his soldiers. They are not intended to do harm to Tibetans, but to other people. If you consider, you will remember how you felt ashamed when the foreign soldiers arrived in Lhasa and oppressed you with much tyranny. We must all be strengthen ourselves on this account, otherwise our religion will be destroyed in 100 or perhaps 1,000 years.\\"Elliot Sperling, \\"The Chinese Venture into K'am, 1904‚Äì11 and the Role of Chao Erhfeng\\", in The History of Tibet: The modern period:1895-1959, the encounter with modernity, ed Alex McKay On 3 January 1910, the Chinese army entered in Lhasa, shooting at random in the city, resulting in a number of wounded and killed policemen and people.K.

Production Initially, the Italian television network RAI expressed interest in recording the live opening night double-bill of Franco Zeffirelli's stage productions of Cavalleria rusticana and Pagliacci at the Teatro alla Scala. However, the director wanted to film the operas like movies instead of live stage productions. Over the course of two days, he filmed both operas on the stage of La Scala without an audience and in segments of ten minutes or less. He later added pick-up shots at a film studio in Milan. He also filmed some on location in Vizzini, Sicily for greater authenticity. Reception Originally shown on Italian television, it was later replayed on U.S. television to enthusiastic reactions.

By Sir William Beechey. Georgian society in Jane Austen's novels is the ever-present background of her work, the world in which all her characters are set. Entirely situated during the reign of George III, the novels of Jane Austen describe their everyday lives, their joys, and sorrows, as well as their loves, and provide in the process an irreplaceable insight into the period. Jane Austen's novels deal with such varied subjects as the historical context, the social hierarchies of the time, the role and status of the clergy, gender roles, marriage, or the pastimes of well-off families. Without even the reader noticing, many details are broached, whether of daily life, of forgotten legal aspects, or of surprising customs, thus bringing life and authenticity to the English society of this period. Nevertheless, the point of view from which Jane Austen describes England is that of a woman of the English gentry (albeit from its lower fringes), belonging to a reasonably well-off family, well connected and remarkably well educated for the time, and living in a very small village of rural England around the late 1790s or early 19th century. Thus, some essential aspects of the Georgian era are virtually absent from her novels, such as the American Revolutionary War and the loss of the Thirteen Colonies, the French Revolution, the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and the birth of the British Empire. Indeed, rather than a depiction of the history of English society at large, Jane Austen's novels provide an understanding of the way of life of the lowest level of the gentry in rural England at the turn of the 19th century.  Georgian society  All of Jane Austen's novels are set against the background of daily life in English Georgian society at the turn of the 19th century. As the name indicates, the Georgian period covers the successive reigns of kings George I, George II, George III, and George IV. That of William IV is also sometimes included. This was a period of considerable progress, and was the precursor to the Victorian era which followed. During Jane Austen's own life, Britain suffered first the loss of its American colonies, then anxiety about the French Revolution, after which it confronted and finally overcame the Napoleonic Empire, and finally laid the foundations of the British Empire. From the social point of view, a new social order emerged at this time with the beginnings of industrialisation. This was followed in the early years of the 19th century by serious social unrest (such as the revolt of the Luddites) caused by the economic changes it gave rise to and the anxieties that accompanied it.Williams, Gwydion M. (2000). Adam Smith: Wealth Without Nations. Athol Books The Arts also flourished at this time, with tremendous output in all fields. In architecture Robert Adam, John Nash and James Wyatt were active, and the neo-gothic style emerged. In painting Thomas Gainsborough and Sir Joshua Reynolds were the great names, and new painters such as J. M. W. Turner and John Constable were gaining recognition. In literature too there were a host of famous writers such as Samuel Johnson and Samuel Richardson, and poets such as Samuel Coleridge, William Wordsworth, Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats and Lord Byron. It was a time of progress in education for women, leading to the proliferation of novels written and read by women, women writers who included Jane Austen herself, and also predecessors such as Fanny Burney, Ann Radcliffe and Maria Edgeworth.Corman, Brian (2008). Women novelists before Jane Austen. University of Toronto Press Finally, the Georgian period was a time of moral questioning and debate. The beginnings of feminism appeared at this time with Mary Wollstonecraft and her groundbreaking work A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Growing concern about slavery was another major development, which soon led to the abolition of the slave trade (1807), and ultimately to the abolition of slavery in the British Empire in 1833.  Perspective  Jane Austen, from a drawing by sister Cassandra. Jane Austen's purpose never was to write historical or social novels, nor to provide a balanced and objective picture of late 18th century England. Her stories‚Äîconsidered as \\"comic\\", because of their happy endings‚ÄîA. Walton Litz, 1965, p. 142. all take place in the society she knew, that of a small rural gentry family, rather well-off though without fortune, around the 19th century. As she wrote in one of her letters to niece Anna Austen: \\"three or four families in a Country Village [is] the little bit (two Inches wide) of Ivory on which I work\\".Ronald Carter, John McRae, The Routledge history of literature in English, Routledge, 2001, p. 213 Consequently, some aspects of Georgian society, despite their importance, are ignored, or, at most, hinted at, in Austen's novels: thus, the loss of the Thirteen Colonies, as the Declaration of Independence took place when she was barely one year old, as well as the war with the former colonies itself and the ensuing Treaty of Paris in 1783, when she was eight, do not have any part in her novels. The 12th century Steventon church, which was that of George Austen, Jane Austen's father. Similarly, the French Revolution does not find its way into her work, except as regards her cousin Eliza Hancock, comtesse de Feuillide and her French husband, Jean-Fran√ßois Capot de Feuillide, who was guillotined in 1794. Even the birth of the British Empire is largely absent from her world. However, the owners of Mansfield Park have a plantation in the Caribbean, and the Austens had a connection with India, since that is where Eliza and her mother, Philadelphia Hancock, had arrived from around 1786. Indeed, the Austens were warm supporters of Warren Hastings, Philadelphia's long time friend (and possibly Eliza's father),Warren Hastings was one of the first admirers of Pride and Prejudice (see David Cecil, 2009, p. 35). when he was sued for serious misdemeanour in IndiaDavid Cecil, 2009, p. 35 before being cleared in April 1795. Though the Industrial Revolution had started in England as early as the 1750s, it is not apparent in the way she lived as well as in her novels.In her last novel, Sanditon, however, which remained unfinished because of her death, there appear some definitely modern aspects, in connection with the speculation in this fast developing seaside resort Life in the small rural village of Steventon, Hampshire, where the family rectory was, kept her quite far from this new world. Besides, she belonged to the local gentry, in a reasonably well-off family whose head was the village parson, nurtured by the reading of Samuel Johnson's works;David Cecil, 2009, p. 23 as such, a Tory at heart, she lived in unison with her position in society.David Cecil, 2009, p. 16 But her point of view was that of a woman of her times: clever and perceptive, very well read, she lived however in a society organised by men for men; this meant for a woman considerable difficulties to become financially independent through her own trade, and the fact that social status as well as economic security had to be expected from marriage;Irene Collins, 1994, p. 160-161; Oliver MacDonagh, 1991, pp. 66‚Äì75 these themes are consequently ubiquitous in her novels.  Historical context   George III  Various Georgian era types, during the reign of George III. By Isaac Cruikshank (1799). Promis'd Horrors of the French Invasion: the French Revolution unleashed all kinds of fantasies in the British imagination (caricature by James Gillray, in 1796). The reign of George III‚Äîif one includes in it the Regency period that took place during his final illness ‚Äì encompasses all of Jane Austen's life, and even beyond, as it started in 1760, just before her parents married in 1764, and ended up in 1820, after the death of Austen in 1817 and the posthumous publication of her two novels, Persuasion and Northanger Abbey in 1818.Deirdre Le Faye, 2003, p. 7  French Revolution  It is through her cousin Eliza de Feuillide, married to a French aristocrat, that Jane Austen first heard of the French Revolution and of its violence. Eliza stayed in England in 1786 and 1787, and made several trips between France and England from 1788 to 1792. In January 1791, Eliza was in Margate, and was hoping that her husband, who had just joined a royalist group in Turin, could come back to her in June. After a brief stay in England during the winter of 1791, he then returned to France, as he wanted to come to the assistance of a friend, the Marquise de Marbeuf, accused of conspiring against the Republic. Unfortunately, he was unmasked while trying to suborn a witness, and duly arrested and guillotined.Warren Roberts, 1995, p. 11. The memory of Eliza de Feuillide can be seen in several of Austen's Juvenilia, such as Love and Freindship (sic)‚Äîdedicated, as it was, to \\"Madame la Comtesse de Feuillide\\"‚Äîor Henry and Eliza. As the same time, the French Revolution led in England to the Revolution Controversy, involving such thinkers as Mary Wollstonecraft and her groundbreaking book A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, William Godwin, Thomas Paine and Joseph Priestley. Austen, as the staunch Tory supporter she had always been, was herself in favour of the family as bringing stability in the midst of the turmoils of the times.  Napoleonic Wars  The Napoleonic Wars are the series of wars that took place in Europe while Napoleon was France's head of state. They are the continuation of the wars that arose as a result of the French Revolution in 1789, saw France briefly dominate most of Europe, and continued until the final defeat of Napoleon in 1815. These were wars on a formerly unprecedented scale, largely as a result of mass conscription, and Britain remained at war with France throughout the period of 1803 to 1815, only two years before Austen died. Two of Jane Austen's brothers, Frank and Charles, made their careers in the Royal Navy. This period of warfare accounts for the importance of the military in the novels, where some of the protagonists are officers, and the presence of officers at social functions is frequently a factor in the social life of a neighbourhood. Hence in Sense and Sensibility Marianne's suitor is Colonel Brandon, the dastardly Wickham in Pride and Prejudice is an officer in the militia, and the youngest Bennet girls are obsessed with the officers at the nearby training camp in Meryton. In Mansfield Park, Fanny Price's brother is a midshipman in the Royal Navy, and in Northanger Abbey, Frederick Tilney is an army officer and his father a retired general. Persuasion Frederick Wentworth is a naval officer whose career takes him from poverty to success and wealth.  Social and economic ranks   Income spread  A young and promising captain of the Royal Navy in 1781, Horatio Nelson. By John Francis Rigaud. Industrious Cottagers in 1801. By William Ward, after James Ward. The income spread seen in Jane Austen's novels allows us to better determine the social status of her different characters. Except in the case of heiresses, where we talk about the total fortune, these revenues are always annual. In any case, it is easy to calculate the income corresponding to a given fortune, since money invested in government funds pays 5% a year (or only 4% in the case of a small investment). Thus Caroline Bingley's fortune of 20,000 pounds (Pride and Prejudice) guarantees her an income of 1000 pounds a year, already a large sum which guarantees her a competence, that is, everything that can be considered necessary to lead a pleasant life, including a carriage.Edward Copeland, Juliet McMaster, 1997, p. 134 Jane Austen's novels depict a whole income hierarchy which implies very different lifestyles. One hundred pounds a year: in Jane Austen's novels, this is a very low income, that of a poor curate, for example, or of a civil servant working in a government office, or again of a small shopkeeper. However, it is rather satisfactory compared with that of a farm labourer which can be as little as twenty-five pounds a yearTwenty-five pounds a year is also the yearly income about which Mary Wollstonecraft wrote to her sister for a governess's position, which would provide food and shelter, though nothing beyond. See also Janet M. Todd, 2005, p. 320. including extra work at harvest time.Janet M. Todd, 2005, p. 320 With 100 pounds a year, the best one can expect is to have a maid of all work, as Mrs Jennings points out to Edward Ferrars and Lucy Steele (Sense and Sensibility) when they seem to be about to get married with only this level of income.Edward Copeland, Juliet McMaster, 1997, p. 135 Two hundred pounds: this is the income of Jane Austen's parents four years after their marriage in 1764; even though it is double what they had at the beginning of their married life, it is barely adequate due to the birth of their children. Three hundred pounds would better meet their needs, even though that is the income of which Colonel Brandon says to Edward Ferrars that it is a nice sum for a single man, but \\"insufficient to permit him to marry\\". Four, or better, five hundred pounds: this is the level above which one can lead the life befitting a member of the gentry. It is the income enjoyed by Mrs Dashwood, which permits her to give her daughters a decent existence, with two maids and a serving man, but neither carriage nor horses. Seven hundred to a thousand pounds a year make a carriage possible: when George Austen, Jane's father, reaches an income of 700 pounds he buys himself one, even though he realises that it is a pleasure that is slightly too expensive.Edward Copeland, Juliet McMaster, 1997, p. 136 Two thousand pounds a year might seem a very comfortable sum, even for a gentleman. It is, for example, Colonel Brandon's income in Sense and Sensibility. But it is also the income of Mr Bennet, who, with a wife and five daughters, has difficulty living well on this sum. It is, however, true that his abilities in household management are very poor. Four thousand pounds and above are the level above which even a gentleman ceases to need to do too much counting. It is the income enjoyed by Henry Crawford, Mr Rushworth (Mansfield Park), Bingley, and Mr Darcy (Pride and Prejudice) who actually has 10,000 pounds a year. At this level of income, one has a manor house or even a country estate, a carriage and everything that goes with it, and also no doubt a house in London to be able to make a comfortable stay in the capital. But these incomes, large as they are, are exceeded by the real-life 100,000 pounds a year at the disposal of the owner of Chatsworth House, the Duke of Devonshire.Deirdre Le Faye, 2003, p. 129To these 100,000 pounds per annum‚Äîcorresponding to the income from his Devonshire estate‚Äîmust be added profits from his mining interests in Derbyshire, as well as rents from property in London. See Deirdre Le Faye, 2003, p. 129. The fact remains, however, that Jane Austen's universe is a privileged world which conceals the harshness of the living conditions of the vast majority of the rural population, a population which is impoverished, uneducated and brutal. Thus common amusements include the omnipresent dog fighting and cockfighting. In the spirit of the times, this brutality is considered by many politicians as being necessary to get the British people accustomed to the sight of blood, and to forge \\"the true British bulldog character\\"., p. 574  Gentry  Jane Austen's novels are set in the social context of the gentry, to which Jane Austen herself belonged. Some of her heroines have no fortune (Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park), others on the other hand are very well off (Emma), but the social class remains the same. The gentleman A gentleman in a blue coat, with powdered hair,Powdering one's hair appears in The Watsons; it fell out of fashion around 1805 (Margaret Drabble, \\"Social Background\\", Jane Austen, 2003, p. 35, Lady Susan, The Watsons and Sanditon). and wearing a Wellington tie (around 1800). The concept of gentleman in England is more flexible than that of nobleman in France. A gentleman is distinguished by his personal qualities as much as by his status as a member of the landed gentry. He does not need to be of noble lineage, like his French counterpart the gentilhomme, or to have a noble name. As the successor to the franklin, the free landed proprietor, who occupied the lowest rank of the nobility in the Middle Ages, the simple gentleman therefore comes after the Esquire (title derived from Squire, the chief landed proprietor in a district), who in turn is inferior, in ascending order of precedence, to the Knight, the Baronet, the Baron, the Viscount, the Earl, the Marquess, and finally to the Duke. Only the titles of Baron or higher belong to the peerage, to which simple knights or baronets do not therefore belong. It is the gentleman of the Georgian period who is the precursor to the gentleman of the Victorian period in that he establishes a code of conduct based on the three Rs: Restraint, Refinement and Religion. During the reign of George III, the British begin, by their reserve and emotional control, to distinguish themselves from the peoples of southern Europe who are of a more hot-headed temperament. The literature of the 19th century does nevertheless privilege emotion, often to the point of pathos, as in Dickens. Country houses and parks, and their owners Chatsworth House,Indeed, Chatsworth House appears as Pemberley in the 2005 film Pride and Prejudice, directed by Joe Wright, and starring Keira Knightley. Jane Austen had very probably visited Chatsworth in 1811, when revising Pride and Prejudice, during a stay in Derbyshire in an inn a few miles from Chatsworth House ( The selected essays of Donald Greene, p. 303). However, as there is no direct reference to Chatsworth House in the novel, whereas there is a specific description of Pemberley, it may be assumed that Pemberley is partly an imagined place, as are Longbourn or Meryton. often believed to be Pemberley House,, ff. 301 and seat of the Dukes of Devonshire. The differences in income and fortune reflected in Jane Austen's novels are considerable. In real Georgian society, the Duke of Devonshire maintains a household of 180 people in his magnificent country house, Chatsworth House. Just to feed that number of people, five cattle and fifteen sheep are slaughtered each week. In return for this wealth, it is customary for the proprietor to use his huge kitchens to have thick soups prepared and distributed to the most needy villagers during the winter, when bad weather sets in and fuel becomes scarce. In Great Britain, the 18th century is a period of considerable wealth generation; the nobility therefore live in sumptuous country houses, among them Blenheim, Knole House, Castle Howard, and of course Chatsworth, all of which are comparable with the royal family's most beautiful homes. The style of the great houses and manors constructed at the beginning of the century is almost always Palladian, with the great architect William Kent. This strict Palladian style becomes freer with Robert Adam. It is possible to imagine that Rosings Park, Lady Catherine de Bourgh's house, and Mansfield Park, both of which Jane Austen describes as modern, belong to the style of houses constructed by Robert Adam. View of Chatsworth House from the top of the Cascade. The park of Chatsworth House had been redesigned by Capability Brown. During the same period, rich owners devote a lot of time and money to beautifying the grounds surrounding their house, and to making the approaches and the views from the windows more impressive. The famous English landscape artist \\"Capability\\" Brown is in fact active during the Georgian period; his nickname is based on his favourite declaration that certain grounds offered \\"a great capability of improvement\\". The beauty of English estates at this time also becomes a symbol of national identity when in 1780 Horace Walpole contrasts their natural style, an expression of freedom, with the geometrical layout of French gardens, which according to him bears witness to the authoritarianism of France's political r√©gime. We find this preoccupation with landscaping aesthetics reflected in Mansfield Park, during the long discussion where Mr Rushworth speaks of his ambition to improve the grounds of his Sotherton house and the views it offers. Following Capability Brown but going even further, Humphry Repton softens the transition between the houses themselves and their surroundings, where Brown had simply extended lawns right up to the house. This too is in reaction against French-style gardens. It is Repton who at Adlestrop in Gloucestershire, where Jane Austen's cousins the Leighs live, remodels the vast grounds of Adlestrop House to combine them with the garden of the adjoining vicarage, and diverts a watercourse to compose a lovely landscape which can be admired equally well from the manor house and from the vicarage. The memory of the beauty of English parks is a constant in Jane Austen's novels, and she associates it with the poems of William Cowper, the poet of the English countryside. And in perfect keeping with the aesthetic principles promoted by Thomas Whately in his Observations on Modern Gardening in 1770, the description of the grounds of the houses she depicts is as important as that of the house itself, for the beauty of the place consists of the harmonious and natural union of the two:  Clergy   The clergy in Jane Austen's novels  The clergy occupy an essential place in Jane Austen's work, even more than the Royal Navy, because Jane Austen's father himself was a clergyman, as were her brother James, and briefly her brother Henry. The moral principles taught by her father are found in the moral precepts sprinkled throughout the novels. The position of clergyman at the time was a special one from several points of view. Firstly, being a clergyman was a profession like any other. Any well-educated, well-spoken man of sound morals could enter it, and no particular religious vocation was called for. And as Mary Crawford points out in Mansfield Park, the living attached to the post of vicar guaranteed a good income for work that was not onerous. Moreover, thanks to the living, a clergyman was in a position to start a family earlier than a naval officer, who might have to wait for years before raising enough money to do so. Nor do clergymen in the novels benefit from any special consideration on the part of the author. On the contrary, they are frequently depicted in a very unflattering light, although there are others who are shown as more sympathetic and admirable characters. Mr Elton, in Emma, demonstrates an excessive social ambition in proposing to the eponymous Emma Woodhouse, and once he is married later in the novel, he and his wife Augusta patronise the villagers and disgust Emma with their pretentiousness. In Pride and Prejudice, Mr Collins is an example of what a clergyman ought not to be. He is obsequious towards the powerful, arrogant towards the weak, sententious and narrow- minded. In spite of his faults, however, he seems to be more involved in his job than an Edward Ferrars or a Henry Tilney. Henry Tilney, in fact, in Northanger Abbey, is absent from his parish half the time and takes holidays in Bath, so that in spite of his intellectual and moral qualities, he bears witness to the lack of commitment of certain clergymen towards their flock. As for Edward Ferrars in Sense and Sensibility, he does give evidence of a more definite vocation when he insists that he has \\"always preferred the Church\\" as his profession, even though his family consider a career in the army or the Royal Navy \\"more appropriate\\", or the law more worthy of a gentleman. Edmund Bertram alone, in Mansfield Park, shows an unshakeable vocation that all Mary Crawford's charm and seductiveness never succeed in weakening. Try as she may, incessantly praising the superior merits and prestige of a military career, the solidity of his principles and his deep conviction prevent him from doubting.  Revenues of the clergyman  The income of a clergyman varied a great deal depending on the living assigned to him. A small, poor, rural parish like Steventon might be worth only about ¬£100 a year, while a good parish could be worth nearly ¬£1000. The allocation of the living, and therefore of the benefits attached to it, was often in the hands of the local lord of the manor, though a number were held by the diocesan bishop and even some university colleges. (This right was called the right of advowson and could be bought and sold or donated like propertty.) The two components of the living were the tithe and the glebe of which the incumbent was the beneficiary. The tithe The tithe in theory guaranteed the clergyman one tenth of the product of all the cultivated land in the parish; it constituted a sort of tax which had existed in England since the 9th century, with the clergyman himself as the tax-collector. Legally, however, the beneficiary of the tithe was not the clergyman (who might find that only part was allocated to him), but the rector. Thus when Colonel Brandon in Sense and Sensibility informs Edward Ferrars that \\"Delaford is a rectory\\", he is also informing him that if he were awarded the parish, he would receive the whole of the corresponding tithe. Jane Austen's father was himself rector of Steventon. Once collected, the revenue had to be managed, since in a poor rural economy the tithe was often paid in kind. This led to a clergyman's needing to have the use of a tithe barn in which to store what he had collected. He also had to negotiate with his parishioners to get all that he was owed. The parishioners did not always react well to his role as tax collector, which took up a large part of a clergyman's time, so much so that Mr Collins, at the Bingleys' ball (Pride and Prejudice), lists it as the first of his duties, ahead even of writing sermons, which comes in second place. The patron of the living also of course had an interest in increasing the revenue raised by the incumbent since this raised the value of the charge he could sell or bestow. The curate or rector's protector is a major personage in the region, as for example are Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr Collins' patron in Pride and Prejudice and Colonel Brandon in Sense and Sensibility. Moreover, this patron may want to reserve a living for a younger son, as does Sir Thomas Bertram with respect to Edmund in Mansfield Park, or General Tilney in favour of Henry in Northanger Abbey. The glebe The glebe was a parcel of land donated to the church, often in the distant past, whose produce was designated for the incumbent of the corresponding parish. This necessarily made the clergyman into a farmer, a job which therefore took up a large part of his time. Thus Parson Trulliber, in Henry Fielding's 1742 novel Joseph Andrews, spends six days out of seven on his farming activities, and Parson Adams, when he visits him at home, finds him \\"with an apron on and a pail in his hand, just come from serving his hogs\\". Even when it didn't go that far, this necessary farm work further reduced the time actually spent on religious tasks as such.  Women's occupations   Education  In Jane Austen's time, girls' boarding schools already existed, even if for the aristocracy a governess was the normal choice for the education of the girls in the family. Thus in Emma, young Harriet Smith, whose origins are very modest, is placed in Mrs Goddard's boarding school to receive a minimal education. On the other hand, Emma Woodhouse, daughter of a good family with a fine fortune, has her own governess, Miss Taylor. And Lady Catherine de Bourgh (Pride and Prejudice) is scandalised to learn that the five Bennet girls, who belong to the minor gentry, have not benefited from the services of a governess. Jane Austen herself, whose family was no better off than the Bennets, got her education essentially through contact with her father and brothers, and through making good use of her father's well-stocked library.  Women's employment  Slow progress in the education of girls needs to be seen in relation to the absence of suitable employment for women from good families, except, in fact, for a job as a governess or schoolmistress. The very idea that a woman might have a profession, with the attendant status and financial independence, was virtually inconceivable. As Mary Wollstonecraft wrote in 1792 in her famous A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: \\"How many women thus waste away the prey of discontent, who might have practiced as physicians, regulated a farm, managed a shop, and stood erect, supported by their own industry, instead of hanging their heads?\\" This state of affairs was well-known to Jane Austen, since being unmarried herself, she was seeking through the sale of her novels to contribute to earning her own living by her work. Her writing perfectly reflects her situation, even though she did not rebel against it directly, in that she almost never depicts women involved in anything other than domestic activities, except for those who teach either as a governess or at a boarding school. The situation of Jane Fairfax in Emma is the best illustration of this: of very humble origin, but intelligent, cultured, close to the ideal of the accomplished woman (she sings and plays the piano perfectly), her only prospect for the future is a post as governess in the home of people much inferior to her in terms of talent. Lady Bertram (Mansfield Park), whose faults Jane Austen makes fun of, offers a perfect example of the ideal fashionable at the time of the elegant, leisured lady so strongly denounced by Mary Wollstonecraft.  Legal rights  A portrait of Mary Wollstonecraft, author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. By John Opie, Tate Gallery. The situation of women appearing in Jane Austen's novels shows at times their inferior status, on a legal as well as a financial level. Thus, according to William Blackstone, in his Commentaries on the Laws of England (Oxford, 1765), man and woman become, by marriage, one and the same person: as long as the marriage lasts, the woman's legal existence is viewed as \\"suspended\\", and all her actions are done \\"under her husband's cover\\" (becoming herself a feme-covert). The rights and duties of the spouses derived from this principle. Thus, a man could not donate any piece of property, nor enter into any agreement with her, as her separate legal existence would be required for such deeds. On the other hand, he could bequeath property to his wife by will, since his wife's \\"coverture\\" would cease with his death. A woman who had been wronged‚Äîeither herself or through her property‚Äîcould not sue whoever had wronged her without the agreement and legal involvement of her husband. Conversely, no one could sue a married woman except through prosecuting her husband.Jane Austen, Kristin Flieger Samuelian, Emma, Broadview Press, 2004, p. 437 A portrait of Caroline Norton, who became a feminist writer after her dramatic experience of the English laws of the times. This lack of any legal existence for married women was at the heart of the long and sensational divorce case that opposed, starting in the 1830s, Caroline Norton and her brutal, drunkard husband.Barbara Caine, English feminism, 1780‚Äì1980, Oxford University Press, 1997, pp. 66‚Äì70 Indeed, after years of conjugal misery, she finally left her husband, who retained total custody of her children; on top of which she came to realise that all her earnings as an author belonged to him (since he legally represented her), while at the same time he did not pay her the allowance he had agreed to. In spite of this much-publicized case, it was only in 1882 that, through the Married Women's Property Act, the legal rights of married women became equal to those of unmarried women (called 'feme sole') in that they gained the right to retain full control of their own property.Richard L. Abel, Philip S C Lewis, Lawyers in Society, Beard Books, 1989, p. 201  Role  =The accomplished woman= An accomplished woman, who draws the admiration of men by her accomplishments, has to master so many things that, as Elizabeth Bennet says to Mr Darcy, I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing any. =Accomplishments= The list of accomplishments is indeed long, as can be seen in Pride and Prejudice, in the discussion Mr Darcy, Mr Bingley, Miss Bingley and Elizabeth Bennet have on the subject. If Mr Bingley's requirements are initially limited (paint tables, cover screens, and net purses), Mr Darcy and Miss Bingley are agreed in demanding some much more serious talents, such as a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, as well as a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions. To these, Mr Darcy adds the improvement of her mind by extensive reading. =Purpose= Jane Austen's novels offer several answers to the question of the purpose of these accomplishments. If some of them, embroidery for example, are useful from a domestic point of view, others have hardly any practical use at all. This is the case for a knowledge of the French language, an essential accomplishment at the time, even though England and France are at war. The goal therefore appears to be to honour her (future) husband by acquiring knowledge, a deportment and manners worthy of a lady. But another aspect often appears: it is on women that the pleasures of social life depend. At a time when the opportunities to hear music are rare and expensive, a musical woman can charm guests with a few piano pieces, sing as Emma Woodhouse and Jane Fairfax do at the party at the Coles' (Emma), or provide the necessary accompaniment for an impromptu dance. In the same way, in the absence of photography, the possibility of recording a beloved face depends on women's talents in drawing or watercolour painting. This can be seen when Emma makes a portrait of Harriet Smith at the request of Mr Elton, and in the fact that the only known portrait of Jane Austen herself is one drawn by her sister Cassandra. =Other roles= An essential role of women in the Georgian period is to have children. This is a major role, reflected in the growth of England's population at this time, a role with which Jane Austen is well acquainted since she herself has no fewer than thirteen nieces and eleven nephews. It is also a difficult role, and dangerous at this time, since three of her sisters- in-law die in childbirth. This aspect however finds little place in Jane Austen's novels. Other than Pride and Prejudice, in which Mrs Bennet struggles to marry off her five daughters, the families portrayed in her novels have few children compared with the reality at the time. A second exception to this is Northanger Abbey, where the heroine, Catherine Morland, is one of ten children. It is true that Jane Austen's great novels are all situated before marriage, and that is what is really at stake. Married women and young girls are also very active in corresponding with those close to them, and this constitutes almost the only source of information on members of the family living in other parts of the country.  Daily life   Women's fashions  Marie Antoinette in muslin dress and wide-brimmed hat. By √âlisabeth Vig√©e Le Brun (1783). Fashionable‚Äîbut inflammable‚Äîthe robe anglaise resorted to muslin for lightness and volume. Hand coloured etching, by James Gillray (1802). By the 1780s, hairstyles with the hair piled high and decorated with ostrich feathers were falling out of fashion and being replaced by a style consisting of long curls hanging loose, that could occasionally be powdered for greater formality. It is this new fashion that makes it possible for Willoughby to cut a lock of Marianne's hair in Sense and Sensibility.Deirdre Le Faye, 2003, p. 96 As at the French court, where Marie Antoinette was setting the fashion for a \\"pastoral\\" style of clothing, women were wearing broad-brimmed hats decorated with ribbons. This is what Eliza de Feuillide, Jane Austen's cousin who is familiar with the receptions at Versailles, explains to Phylly Walter, another cousin, when she inquires after the latest fashions in France.Janet M. Todd, 2005, p. 237 This same Eliza complains in turn about the stiff fashions still being worn at the Court of St. James's where, she says, \\"she had to stand for two hours on end wearing a pannier dress whose weight was not negligible\\". At the same time as dresses with hoop skirts were becoming unfashionable, heavy brocade and embroidered silk fabrics too were disappearing, replaced by muslin dresses worn with petticoats to give them volume. This volume, and the vaporous appearance it gave these muslin dresses, were considered to give women a more natural silhouette. This natural fashion soon also became much more revealing, to an extent bordering on scandalous, as Eliza de Feuillide gleefully noted during a stay in Bath in 1798. For it was Bath, and still more London, that was the fashion leader. When Jane Austen's characters talk about buying a dress, it means in fact that they are going to buy the necessary fabric, which they will then give to a specialised dressmaker who will make a dress to their specifications, based on the latest fashion in the capital. This is the case for Harriet Smith (in Emma) when she wants to obtain a pattern-gown (a dress from a pattern), to be made of the muslin she has just bought. Patterns for dresses in the latest London fashion were found in all the women's fashion newspapers, and based on these, the customer could explain to the dressmaker the particular adjustments she wanted made.  Homes  The homes in which Jane Austen's novels are set are all situated in the southern half of England, and with the sole exception of Mansfield Park, in counties and towns she knew personally. It is characteristic of Jane Austen's period that all sorts of houses exist there side by side, houses of very different origins, periods and status, and that the characters in her novels are sensitive to these differences. This diversity is the reflection of the successive strata of the English habitat. Jane Austen's heroines thus occupy cottages (Barton Cottage in Sense and Sensibility), abbeys converted into vast residences (the titular Northanger Abbey, or Donwell Abbey in Emma), parks (mansions surrounded by a vast park, like Mansfield Park in the novel of the same name, or Rosings Park in Pride and Prejudice), courts (another type of mansion, in theory approached via a vast courtyard, like Sotherton Court in Mansfield Park), halls (manors, like Uppercross Hall in Persuasion, and finally simple houses, like Longbourn House, the home of the Bennet family in Pride and Prejudice. This is why Catherine Morland is so delighted when she discovers Northanger Abbey, thinking, \\"With all the chances against her of house, hall, place, park, court, and cottage, Northanger turned up an abbey, and she was to be its inhabitant.\\" The mansions referred to above can have so many works of art worth seeing that some of them receive visitors who come simply as tourists. In Jane Austen's novels, however, this is the case of only two of them, Pemberley and Sotherton Court, since even Mansfield Park does not possess an art collection fit to interest a tourist. The layout of these traditional grand residences is not necessarily very rational: Sotherton Court, as well as Northanger Abbey, are laid out en suite, that is, each room opens into the next. On the other hand, much more modest but \\"modern\\" homes, like Longbourn in Pride and Prejudice, are organised in a way that is much better suited to their use: the public rooms where visitors or guests are received, dining room, drawing room, etc., are located on the ground floor, while the private rooms such as bedrooms are upstairs. Interiors In Jane Austen's England, interiors are very varied, both as a function of the wealth of the home, of course, and also as a function of its age. The walls are often papered, paper having been a less expensive substitute for the tapestries of noble homes since the 16th century. But it is not until the 18th century that manufacturing processes become capable of producing wallpaper whose appearance can satisfy people of quality. At the same time, some very fine wallpapers are being imported from China by the East India Company. Wallpaper is thus the indoor decoration typical of the well-off, and we see for example Edward Ferrars and Elinor, as soon as are they married and installed at Delaford, start looking for some to suit them. As for the impressive Gothic Northanger Abbey, Catherine Morland is very disappointed to find wallpaper on the walls of her room, which she was expecting to be much less prosaic. In fine houses in the 18th century, however, the fashion is for wainscoting, with only the upper part of the wall papered. Paint, more expensive than wallpaper, is also preferred in sumptuous residences such as Rosings Park or Mansfield Park, since it permits contrasting colours, sometimes highlighted with gilding. As for the floor, it is left bare if it consists of beautiful tile or paving; in the 18th century this is the case too for handsome parquet floors, which may be set off by a small Turkish rug placed in the centre of the room. At the same time, progress in the textile industry now makes it possible for companies in towns such as Kidderminster to produce carpets to cover the entire floor in the reception rooms. The windows that let light into the rooms can be very different, going from leaded glass to modern sash windows, a style imported from France. When Catherine Morland arrives at Northanger Abbey, she is devastated to find that the reception rooms have been modernised, and that the gothic frames hold only large panes of glass allowing the light to flood in: \\"To be sure ... ‚Äî the form of them was Gothic ... ‚Äî but every pane was so large, so clear, so light! ... To an imagination which had hoped for the smallest divisions, and the heaviest stone-work, for painted glass, dirt and cobwebs, the difference was very distressing.\\"  Meals and food  In Jane Austen's time meals are eaten late. Breakfast, in fact, is never eaten before ten o'clock, leaving time for various activities before this first meal: Edward Ferrars (Sense and Sensibility) walks to the village of Barton to inspect his horses, and Edmund Bertram (Mansfield Park) has a long conversation with Fanny Price, then a tense discussion with his brother Tom, and only afterwards does he go to breakfast. After breakfast, there is no regular meal before dinner, which is never taken before three o'clock in the afternoon. It is however appropriate to offer light refreshments (cold meats, cakes and fruit in season) when a visitor arrives between these two meals. After dinner, tea is taken at about six or seven o'clock in the evening, actually a high tea including a light meal. It is not until still later, about nine o'clock, that people sit down for the last meal of the day, supper. But these times, late as they are, are the ones in use at the beginning of the 18th century. Towards the end of the century, times get even later. It is, moreover, good form (socially advantageous) to eat late, and Jane Austen's characters affirm, if not their actual social status, at least their concerns about it, by eating later still. At Barton Cottage, in fact, the home of Marianne's and Elinor's mother Mrs Dashwood (Sense and Sensibility), dinner is eaten at about four o'clock in the afternoon, as it is at Hartfield, the home of Emma Woodhouse's father. General Tilney, on the other hand, in Northanger Abbey, dines at six o'clock, while the rich and snobbish Caroline Bingley (Pride and Prejudice) does not dine until half past six, and her supper is not until about midnight. At table, during a sit-down meal as opposed to light refreshments, the guests are offered two or three courses served √† la fran√ßaise as it is called, that is, with all the dishes on the table at the same time, with each guest helping themselves only to what they want. These dishes, which can number from five to about twenty per course, include soup, large pieces of meat or fish served whole, poultry, vegetables, seasonal game, sauces and condiments, cakes, etc. When the first course is finished, the table is cleared and the second course brought in, with just as many dishes, sweet as well as savoury. Finally, after the second course, comes dessert, including pastries, fruit in season, dried fruits, nuts, ices, and dessert wines. Such a large number of dishes ‚Äì and the wealthier the home the more of them there are ‚Äì requires the housekeeping to be of a very high standard, and costs a considerable amount of money. This abundance upon others' tables makes the miserly Mrs Norris (Mansfield Park) jealous, but she consoles herself with the \\"conviction of its being impossible among so many dishes but that some must be cold.\\" Similarly Frank Churchill and Emma Woodhouse (Emma), seated beside each other at the time of the meal at the Coles' house, have to interrupt the lively conversation they are engaged in in order \\"to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses\\".  Country life   Carriages  The barouche was the fashionable carriage of the time. Gig, drawn by one horse. Average speed for carriages of this time was seven miles an hour. When general Tilney left Bath for Northanger, his 'handsome, highly-fed four horses' performed the journey of thirty miles at a sober pace, broken into two stages with a two hours' rest in between.Deirdre Le Faye, 2003, p. 54-58 Even then, roads could be in poor state, as remarked by Mrs Norris, between Mansfield and Sotherton (Mansfield Park), or even snowy. Normally only the privileged who earned seven hundred to a thousand pounds a year could afford a carriage, and driving sporting gigs and curricles was largely the preserve of the fashionable, elite male.

It was written as the doctoral dissertation of James Popple under the supervision of Robin Stanton, Roger Clarke, Peter Drahos, and Malcolm Newey. . Also . A full technical report of the expert system, Also . and a book . Also . further detailing its development and testing have also been published. SHYSTER emphasises its pragmatic approach, and posits that a legal expert system need not be based upon a complex model of legal reasoning in order to produce useful advice. Although SHYSTER attempts to model the way in which lawyers argue with cases, it does not attempt to model the way in which lawyers decide which cases to use in those arguments. SHYSTER is of a general design, permitting its operation in different legal domains. It was designed to provide advice in areas of case law that have been specified by a legal expert using a bespoke specification language. Its knowledge of the law is acquired, and represented, as information about cases. It produces its advice by examining, and arguing about, the similarities and differences between cases. It derives its name from Shyster: a slang word for someone who acts in a disreputable, unethical, or unscrupulous way, especially in the practice of law and politics. Methods SHYSTER is a specific example of a general category of legal expert systems, broadly defined as systems that make use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to solve legal problems. Legal AI systems can be divided into two categories: legal retrieval systems and legal analysis systems. SHYSTER belongs to the latter category of legal analysis systems. Legal analysis systems can be further subdivided into two categories: judgment machines and legal expert systems. SHYSTER again belongs to the latter category of legal expert systems. A legal expert system, as Popple uses the term, is a system capable of performing at a level expected of a lawyer: ‚ÄúAI systems which merely assist a lawyer in coming to legal conclusions or preparing legal arguments are not here considered to be legal expert systems; a legal expert system must exhibit some legal expertise itself.\\" Designed to operate in more than one legal domain, and be of specific use to the common law of Australia, SHYSTER accounts for statute law, case law, and the doctrine of precedent in areas of private law. Whilst it accommodates statute law, it is primarily a case-based system, in contradistinction to rule-based systems like MYCIN. More specifically, it was designed in a manner enabling it to be linked with a rule-based system to form a hybrid system. Although case-based reasoning possesses an advantage over rule-based systems by the elimination of complex semantic networks, it suffers from intractable theoretical obstacles: without some further theory it cannot be predicted what features of a case will turn out to be relevant.Greinke, A. (1994): ‚ÄòLegal Expert Systems: A Humanistic Critique of Mechanical Human Inference‚Äô E-Law: Murdoch University Electronic Journal of Law Volume 1, Number 4 (December 1994). Users of SHYSTER therefore require some legal expertise. Richard Susskind argues that ‚Äújurisprudence can and ought to supply the models of law and legal reasoning that are required for computerized [sic] implementation in the process of building all expert systems in law.‚ÄùSusskind, R. (1987): ‚ÄòExpert Systems in Law‚Äô (Oxford) p. 20. Popple, however, believes jurisprudence is of limited value to developers of legal expert systems. He posits that a lawyer must have a model of the law (maybe unarticulated) which includes assumptions about the nature of law and legal reasoning, but that model need not rest on basic philosophical foundations. It may be a pragmatic model, developed through experience within the legal system. Many lawyers perform their work with little or no jurisprudential knowledge, and there is no evidence to suggest that they are worse, or better, at their jobs than lawyers well-versed in jurisprudence. The fact that many lawyers have mastered the process of legal reasoning, without having been immersed in jurisprudence, suggests that it may indeed be possible to develop legal expert systems of good quality without jurisprudential insight. As a pragmatic legal expert system SHYSTER is the embodiment of this belief. A further example of SHYSTER‚Äôs pragmatism is its simple knowledge representation structure. This structure was designed to facilitate specification of different areas of case law using a specification language. Areas of case law are specified in terms of the cases and attributes of importance in those areas. SHYSTER weights its attributes and checks for dependence between them. In order to choose cases upon which to construct its opinions, SHYSTER calculates distances between cases and uses these distances to determine which of the leading cases are nearest to the instant case. To this end SHYSTER can be seen to adopt and expand upon nearest neighbor search methods used in pattern recognition. These nearest cases are used to produce an argument (based on similarities and differences between the cases) about the likely outcome in the instant case. This argument relies on the doctrine of precedent; it assumes that the instant case will be decided the same way as was the nearest case. SHYSTER then uses information about these nearest cases to construct a report. The report that SHYSTER generates makes a prediction and justifies that prediction by reference only to cases and their similarities and differences: the calculations that SHYSTER performs in coming to its opinion do not appear in that opinion. Safeguards are employed to warn users if SHYSTER doubts the veracity of its advice. Results SHYSTER was tested in four different and disparate areas of case law. Four specifications were written, each representing an area of Australian law: an aspect of the law of trover; the meaning of ‚Äúauthorization [sic]‚Äù in Australian copyright law; the categorisation of employment contracts; and the implication of natural justice in administrative decision-making. SHYSTER was evaluated under five headings: its usefulness, its generality, the quality of its advice, its limitations, and possible enhancements that could be made to it. Despite its simple knowledge representation structure, it has shown itself capable of producing good advice, and its simple structure has facilitated the specification of different areas of law. Appreciating the difficulties encountered by legal expert systems developers in adequately representing legal knowledge can assist in appreciating the shortcomings of digital rights management technologies.Cunningham, A. (2005): ‚ÄòRights Expression on Digital Communication Networks: Some Implications for Copyright‚Äô International Journal of Law and Information Technology 2005 13(1) p. 23. Some academics believe future digital rights management systems may become sophisticated enough to permit exceptions to copyright law.See e.g.: Maillard, T. (2004): ‚ÄòTowards Digital Rights and Exemptions Management Systems‚Äô Computer law and Security Report 20 (4), pp. 281‚Äì287. To this end SHYSTER's attempt to model ‚Äúauthorization [sic]‚Äù in the Copyright Act can be viewed as pioneering work in this field. The term ‚Äúauthorization [sic]‚Äù is undefined in the Copyright Act. Consequently, a number of cases have been before the courts seeking answers as to what conduct amounts to authorisation. The main contexts in which the issue has arisen are analogous to permitted exceptions to copyright currently prevented by most digital rights management technologies: ‚Äúhome taping of recorded materials, photocopying in educational institutions and performing works in public‚Äù.McKeough, J., Bowery, K. and Griffith, P. (2002): ‚ÄòIntellectual Property: Commentary and Materials‚Äô (third edition), Lawbook Co. p. 198. When applied to one case concerning compact cassettes,. SHYSTER successfully agreed that Amstrad did not authorise the infringement. SHYSTER-MYCIN Popple highlighted the most obvious avenue of future research using SHYSTER as the development of a rule-based system, and the linking together of that rule-based system with the existing case-based system to form a hybrid system. This intention was eventually realised by Thomas O‚ÄôCallaghan, the creator of SHYSTER-MYCIN: a hybrid legal expert system first presented at ICAIL '03, 24‚Äì28 June 2003 in Edinburgh, Scotland. MYCIN is an existing medical expert system, which was adapted for use with SHYSTER. MYCIN‚Äôs controversial ‚Äúcertainty factor‚Äù is not used in SHYSTER-MYCIN. The reason for this is the difficulty in scientifically establishing how certain a fact is in a legal domain. The rule-based approach of the MYCIN part is used to reason with the provisions of an Act of Parliament only. This hybrid system enables the case-based system (SHYSTER) to determine open textured concepts when required by the rule-based system (MYCIN). The ultimate conclusion of this joint endeavour is that a hybrid approach is preferred in the creation of legal expert systems where ‚Äúit is appropriate to use rule-based reasoning when dealing with statutes, and‚Ä¶case-based reasoning when dealing with cases‚Äù.

He became Principal Staff Officer, to General Oladipo Diya when the latter was Chief of General Staff, between 1993 and 1997. George was also a Director at the Nigerian National War College (NWC). Ports Authority chairman George was appointed Chairman of the Nigerian Ports Authority in 1999. In February 2001, while visiting the Delta ports, Bode George called for increased security, and also discussed the problem of delays in payment of large sums of money owed to the port authority by organizations such as the Petroleum Products Marketing Company, Nigerian National Shipping Line, Delta Steel Company and Central Water Transport Company. In April 2001, George said that one of the causes of port congestion that importers were slow to clear their goods because of fear of seizure. In May 2001, Bode George called for construction of new dry ports and warehouses to tackle congestion. In September 2001, Chief Bode George directed that all empty containers should be moved out of the Lagos seaports to free up space. In July 2002, he appealed to Truck Owners striking over clearance of goods at the Lagos ports to go back to work. In March 2003, George commended the Grimaldi Group for investing in Nigeria, and said the NPA would solve the shortage of berths for ships at the RORO port by expansion when the present government gained power in April. In August 2003, talking of plans to privatize port operations, Bode George said \\"The illusion that the NPA is a buoyant and bottomless source of funds, which has encouraged a culture of carefreeness in the handling of contracts and materials, the unwarranted external influences to procure materials and equipment that are not required for our operations needs, lack of proper stock taking and modern store management procedures, the poor maintenance and management of our assets, all these must give way to harsh realities of our new role.\\" In October 2003, the senior management and the board of the Nigerian Ports Authority was dismissed. The new managing director, Chief Adebayo Sarumi, hired auditors to review major existing contracts. Their review found irregularities. It was passed to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission under Nuhu Ribadu, which started investigations in 2005. PDP positions George was close to president Olusegun Obasanjo, and was given preference in the sale of houses in Lagos state. In 2001, George was made the PDP's national vice-chairman in the southwest zone. Later he became PDP Deputy National Chairman, South, and then the National Deputy Chairman of the PDP. At a March 2001 rally, George appeared to back Chief Funsho Williams, the runner-up in 1998 Lagos State governorship primaries of the Alliance for Democracy (AD) party, as the PDP candidate for the 2003 governorship election. Williams later decamped to the PDP. In February 2002, in response to allegations that the PDP was imposing levies on prospective aspirants for political offices, Bode George said the party had never given such a directive, and anyone caught doing do would be arrested and handed over to the Police. In August 2002, Nick Mbaezue, the leader of Anambra People's Forum (APF) arm of the Anambra State chapter of People's Democratic Party (PDP) accused Bode George of auctioning the PDP executive to the governor's faction. In January 2003, Chief Olorunfunmi Bashorun, the founding chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in Lagos State, and other leaders, petitioned the National Chairman over a crisis in the party. They accused George and his client Alhaji Murtala Ashorobi of favoritism. In April 2004, George denied any involvement in the reported detention of Governor Bola Tinubu of Lagos State and two other former governors. The three were attending a funeral in Iyin- Ekiti when they were detained by soldiers and policemen. In June 2004, a splinter group of the PDP accused Bode George, south-west chairman of the party, Senator Adeseye Ogunlewe, and Mohammed Ashorobi, the PDP state chairman of breaking up the party through of intimidation, blackmail, discrimination and abuse of power. In July 2004, there was a crisis in Anambra State where the house of assembly first stated that the governor Chris Ngige had resigned and the deputy governor, Okey Udeh should take his place, then reversed their decision saying they had been deliberately misled. Bode George headed a PDP panel that recommended that Okey Udeh resign. In January 2005, This Day reported that Bode George was expected to be named National Chairman of the PDP at the party's national convention in November. In July 2005, he was promoted to PDP Deputy National Chairman (South). In February 2007, Olabode George called for the resignation of Vice President Atiku Abubakar, who had defected to the Action Congress (AC) party. In March 2008, the PDP National Chairman, Prince Vincent Ogbulafor dismissed Bode George from the Governing Board of the Peoples Democratic Institute (PDI). In April 2008, the PDP National Disciplinary Committee (NDC), which Bode George headed, was dismantled. EFCC prosecutions In April 2005, Olabode George threatened court action over a newspaper allegation that an N85 billion scam was uncovered in the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) while he was chairman of the NPA board. He described the allegation as senseless, baseless and thoughtless. He was indicted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) when it was headed by Nuhu Ribadu on charges of fraud at the NPA. However, he was widely rumoured to have been shielded from prosecution by President Olusegun Obasanjo. The EFCC report issued on 1 April 2005 stated that NPA board members, including Chairman Bode George, and the management of the NPA should be held responsible for deliberate and flagrant violations of government rules and regulations governing the award of contracts, and should be sanctioned for contract splitting and inflation of contract price in utter disregard to laid- down government rules and regulations. President Obasanjo dismissed the findings as inconclusive, and ordered another investigation. The second EFCC report cleared Bode George. In November 2005, the EFCC invited Bode George to a meeting to discuss a party issue where his name had come up. In March 2006, the Alliance for Democracy (AD) called on President Olusegun Obasanjo to prosecute the Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Olabode George, and the board and management of the NPA over allegations of frivolous award of contracts worth N60 million. In August 2008, the EFCC under its new head Farida Waziri arrested Olabode George in Lagos and arraigned him and four others on a 163 count-charge of conspiracy, disobedience to lawful order, abuse of office and alleged illegal award of contracts worth N84 billion while he was chairman of the NPA. After the trial had started, the EFCC reduced the charge to 63 counts. In October 2009, Bode George was found guilty and sentenced to jail for 30 months. The sentence was handed out by Justice Joseph Olubunmi Oyewole. The judge found the defendants guilty on 47 out of the 68 counts. The total sentences added up to 28 years, but the counts for disobedience to lawful order were ruled to run concurrently for six months, and the counts for contract inflation then to run concurrently for two years. George's lawyers filed an appeal and requested bail pending resolution of the appeal. The appeal was however refused by the court. As a prisoner, Chief Bode George and his colleagues were placed in the V.I.P. section of the prison. They were not required to wear prison uniforms, and were allowed to have meals prepared by their families. On December 13, 2013, the Supreme Court discharged the conviction of Bode George. The court, headed by judge John Afolabi Fabiyi, said the EFCC had no evidence that George intended to commit fraud at the NPA, and the charges of ‚Äúcontract splitting‚Äù was unknown to law.

He played quarterback for the University of Michigan Wolverines football team and was selected in 1916 as a first-team All-American by the New York sports writer Monty. Biography Sparks was a native of Jackson, Michigan. He was the son of William C. and Matilda Sparks. William was a founding partner of the Sparks-Withington Company (later known as Sparton Corporation) and builder of the world famous Cascade Falls in Jackson. He was the son-in-law of Byron J. Carter, a founding partner of the Jackson Automobile Company. Sparks married Rachel Lucretia Carter May 12, 1920 in Jackson. They had three children: Carter, Sallie, and William.\\"Michigan, Marriages, 1868-1925,\\" index and images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/N3BJ-CLM : accessed 03 Mar 2013), Clifford M. Sparks and Rachel L. Carter, 12 May 1920. He weighed 153 pounds. Sparks enrolled at the University of Michigan and joined the university‚Äôs football team coached by Fielding H. Yost. When Sparks arrived in Ann Arbor, the team had recently been led by All-American quarterback Tommy Hughitt. As a sophomore in 1916, Sparks took over the quarterback position and led the team to a 7-2 record. Prior to the opening game of the 1916 season, one Michigan newspaper wrote: \\"Sparks, the Jackson lad, is another back who has proved that he is ready to do his part and looks so much like 'Tommy' Hughitt in action that Yost has stopped worrying about his quarterback position.\\" Yost told reporters before the season began that he believed Sparks would develop into \\"one of the best quarters Michigan has had in recent years.\\" Sparks played his first game for Michigan's varsity football team in the 1916 season opener, a 38-0 win over Marietta College. The Associated Press reported that \\"Michigan ground gaining was done through continuous hard smashing assaults upon the Marietta line with Captain Maulbetsch, Sparks and Raymond taking turns at scoring.\\" Three days later, Sparks played in a 19-3 win over Case, and the Associated Press wrote that \\"Sparks and Maulbetsch scored for Michigan.\\" Sparks received positive comments in the newspapers after Michigan beat Carroll College 54-0 in the third game of the season. While seven Michigan players scored in the game, one newspaper noted that \\"the whirlwind Sparks\\" was the only Michigan player with two touchdowns. Sparks tackled but still gaining Sparks gained national attention after his performance in Michigan's 9-0 win over the Michigan Agricultural College on October 21, 1916. The entire Michigan team gained a total of 200 yards rushing, and Sparks alone accumulated 107 yards of the total. According to one account of the game, Sparks \\"crumpled the Aggie line almost every time he crashed into it and circled ends with ease, and was eel-like in running back punts.\\" The play that drew the most attention was Sparks' drop-kick on a broken play that gave Michigan a 3-0 lead in the first quarter. The play called for Sparks to take the snap from center and hold the ball for a field goal attempt. The snap from center was high, forcing Sparks to react quickly. One press account described Sparks' actions as follows: > \\"And then seemingly with a single movement, Sparks jumped to his feet, > grabbed the ball as it was about to clear his head, whirled to face the goal > posts and drop-kicked the ball over the Aggie bar for a count of three > points, which then and there cinched the game for the Wolverines. 'It was > the greatest individual play ever seen in my whole career as coach or > player,' was 'Hurry Up' Yost's comment after the game. And every person in > the crowd who saw Sparks plan and execute that play in something less than > two seconds chanted 'Amen!'\\" Following the broken play in the first quarter, Sparks sought to confuse the Aggie defense by signaling for a kick formation several times, and on each occasion Sparks did something else \\"to the utter bewilderment of the Aggies.\\" The Associated Press story ran with the headline, \\"SPARKS IS INDIVIDUAL STAR OF MICHIGAN,\\" and reported: \\"Sparks was the star. He made spectacular runs of 10, 15 and 20 yards and directed his offense with good judgment.\\" The United Press story ran under the headline \\"SPARKS, YOST‚ÄôS FIND, STARS TWICE.\\" A Texas newspaper praised Sparks' \\"braininess\\" and called him \\"one of the greatest all-around gridironers that has flashed into view in many years.\\" The Texas paper continued: > \\"The Wolverines have uncovered a quarterback ‚Äì Clifford Sparks ‚Äì whose > brilliant work this ‚Äì his first varsity ‚Äì season ranks him among the most > sensational performers in the western football world. Sparks has a chain- > lightning brain; one that recognizes every opportunity in the minutest > flash. And he has legs and arms that work in harmony. He has 'pulled' plays > repeatedly that have disconcerted the Ann Arbor foes, put them to utter rout > and brought gasps of astonishment from the stands because of their audacity > and their remarkable execution. ‚Ä¶ Sparks ranks right now ‚Äì in his first year > as a Michigan regular ‚Äì as the greatest quarterback Michigan ever has had. > There is nothing he cannot do ‚Äì and do in a way that thrills.\\" Sparks also drew attention for his unusual punting technique. While most punters at that time dropped the ball on the boot, Sparks had \\"mastered that difficult trick of successfully punting after throwing the ball, with force at the uprising boot.\\" By throwing the ball at the shoe, Sparks was able to give his punts greater height and distance. The height of Sparks' punts allowed his teammates time to reach the punt receiver before the ball arrived. During the win over Michigan Agricultural, the longest gain on any of Sparks‚Äô punts was two yards. Sparks' coach, Fielding H. Yost, had acquired the nickname \\"Hurry Up\\" for the rapid style of play he instilled in his players. During the 1916, newspapers joked that, in Sparks, Yost had finally found a player who was such a quick runner and thinker that Yost had been forced to tell him to \\"slow down.\\" A syndicated newspaper story reported: > \\"'Hurry Up' Yost, coach of the Michigan football squad, has finally failed > to live up to his nickname. Yost recently was watching the first eleven in > practice. Quarterback Sparks was tearing through his signals. 'He hurries > too much,' shouted Yost and then he told Sparks to ease up a bit. ... And > so, the Yost nickname, won in 1900, received its first setback.\\" At the end of the 1916 season, the sophomore Sparks was picked as a first-team All-American by New York sports writer, Monty. Nine of Monty's 1916 All- American played for East Coast colleges, with Sparks and Bob Higgins of Penn State as the only Westerners named to the team. With the entry of the United States into World War I, Sparks' football career was interrupted by military service. During the 1917 season, Sparks started only two games at quarterback and one game at left halfback. After World War I, Sparks returned to the University of Michigan. In 1919, he was the starting quarterback for six of the team's seven games and played halfback in the seventh game.

The word \\"Kaillera\\", also spelled \\"ka√Øra\\", is the verlan of the French word racaille which is used in reference to \\"hooligans\\". Unlike GGPO, a technology and program allowing emulated games to be played over the Internet, Kaillera suffers from input lag which results in the player's actions being delayed more the higher the delay in a connection is. This is accentuated by the fact that when not using the Kaillera P2P modification, two players have to be connected through a server, thus increasing the delay of the connection. History Kaillera was developed by Christophe Thibault in the years 2001-2003. His most recent entry was the Kaillera Client library and SDK on 14 April 2003. Later in early 2006, rights and source code of Kaillera were sold to a private online gaming advertising company called TC. Ads and Etai Hugi. On 17 June 2006, Christophe Thibault himself publicly confirmed the sale of Kaillera and also announced that TC. Ads. no longer had anything to do with the Kaillera project and that Etai Hugi is the only owner. On 20 November 2006, Etai Hugi announced that a new version of Kaillera would be released in \\"the next several months\\". His announcement also suggested that the new version would be \\"much better\\" and \\"more efficient\\" than the current version. In July 2007, he posted on the official forums and sent emails to the forum administrator announcing that the next official release would occur in \\"3-4 months.\\" This announcement coincided with a revamp of the forums and the posting of new unofficial builds created by others for download (the first new downloads posted in nearly four years). On 4 November 2007, it was announced that due to unforeseen \\"bugs\\" the imminent release would be postponed for a time. It was later announced that the new version of Kaillera would be released on 7 April 2008. However, the official Kaillera website along with existing Kaillera master servers list was taken down a few days prior to the release date. Later when it came back up, no explanations for the downtime was given and nothing was released. Etai Hugi an Israeli developer purchased Kaillera from Christophe Thibault in 2006. Features Like most networked multiplayer gaming systems, Kaillera is implemented to work on client‚Äìserver architecture. The client is implemented as a small library with a typical GUI which is incorporated with the emulator. Its simple self-explanatory API consisting of only 8 functions allow emulators to perform necessary functions such as specify the list of games it supports and control game execution to some extent. Everything after enabling the client to starting the game is managed by the client and the user. The client can only make requests to server on user's input and react to server's response. On the other hand, the server takes the tedious role of managing all the users. Users can join servers if their conditions are satisfactory. Then they are allowed to chat and make games on the server which other users can join. A maximum of 8 players are allowed to participate in a game and others are treated as spectators. Once a game starts, the server is also responsible for scheduling and mix matching data sent by emulators in a manner befitting user's ping and connection configuration.

Since the late 1980s many readers have ranked Boris Golovin's poetry as one of the most influential in neoclassical movement.

The penis was subsequently surgically reattached. John Wayne Bobbitt was acquitted on the rape charge.  Attack  The incident in which Lorena Bobbitt severed her husband John Wayne Bobbitt's penis occurred June 23, 1993, in Manassas, Virginia. Lorena Bobbitt stated in a court hearing that, after coming home that evening, her husband raped her. After he then went to sleep, she got out of bed and went to the kitchen for a drink of water. She then grabbed an 8-inch carving knife on the kitchen counter, returned to their bedroom, pulled back the bed sheets and cut off his penis. After this, Lorena left the apartment with the severed appendage and drove away in her car. After a while driving and struggling to steer with one hand, she threw it out the window into a roadside field. She eventually stopped and called 9-1-1, telling them what had happened and where the penis could be found. John Bobbitt's penis was found after an exhaustive search, and after being washed with antiseptic and packed in saline ice, it was re- attached in the hospital where he was treated. The operation took nine and a half hours. John went on to star in two pornographic films in the 1990s, and states that his penis is \\"back to normal\\".  Arrest and trial  When Lorena Bobbitt was arrested the night of June 23, she told the police, \\"He always have orgasm [sic], and he doesn't wait for me ever to have orgasm. He's selfish.\\" This conversation with Detective Peter Wentz was tape-recorded, and the transcript was read later in the trial by Mary Grace O'Brien, the Prince William County Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney prosecuting Lorena.Wife cannot recall cutting off man's penis in January 14, 1994 New Straits Times During the trial, the couple revealed details of their volatile relationship and the events that led to the assault. Lorena stated that John sexually, physically, and emotionally abused her during their marriage. She said that he flaunted his infidelities and forced her to have an abortion. Her defense attorneys, who included the defense lawyer Blair D. Howard, maintained that his constant abuse eventually caused her to \\"snap\\" because she was suffering from clinical depression and a possible bout of post traumatic stress disorder due to the abuse. John denied the allegations of abuse; however, when he was cross-examined by Howard, his statements often conflicted with known facts, severely weakening the prosecution's case. Lorena testified that John had raped her and physically battered her on multiple occasions prior to the evening of the severing of his penis, that they lacked financial stability, and that he stole her earnings and spent the proceeds. Both the prosecution and defense sides conceded that he had demonstrated a history of abuse toward her and that this abuse created a context for the assault. Expert witnesses for both the prosecution and the defense testified that \\"he had mentally and physically battered her; that the abuse was escalating; and that, by 1993, she lived in constant fear of him.\\" The defense strategy emphasized her action as being a mix of self-defense and temporary insanity constituting an \\"irresistible impulse\\" due to the history and pattern of abuse and rape. One expert witness testified that \\"Lorena believed and was immobilized by John's threat, 'I will find you, whether we're divorced or separated. And wherever I find you, I'll have sex with you whenever I want to.'\\"(Pershing, page 206) John Bobbitt was later acquitted of rape. He had multiple versions of what had happened that evening in question, relating at various times to police and to the court that \\"they had not had sex; that Lorena had tried to initiate sex, but he had been too tired; that they had had sex, but he had slept through it; and that the sex had been consensual.\\"(Pershing, p. 186) After seven hours of deliberation, the jury found Lorena not guilty due to insanity causing an irresistible impulse to sexually wound John. As a result, she could not be held liable for her actions.Virginia Vs. Lorena Bobbitt, Court TV. Courttv.com. Retrieved on October 14, 2012. Under state law, the judge ordered her to undergo a 45-day evaluation period at Central State Hospital, located in Petersburg, Virginia, after which she would be released. In 1995, after six years of marriage, John and Lorena divorced.  Aftermath   John  After the incident, John attempted to generate money from his renown by forming a band, The Severed Parts, to pay his mounting medical and legal bills, although the band was unsuccessful and failed to generate enough money. In September 1994, he appeared in the adult film John Wayne Bobbitt: Uncut, in another attempt to make money. In 1996, he appeared in another adult film, Frankenpenis (also known as John Wayne Bobbitt's Frankenpenis). In 1994, he was charged with striking Kristina Elliott, a 21-year-old former exotic dancer he met while in Las Vegas on a publicity tour. On August 31, 1994, he was convicted of battery and sentenced to 15 days in jail (75% of the original 60-day sentence was suspended). \\"I firmly believe you have an attitude problem,\\" Justice of the Peace William Jansen told Bobbitt. \\"Your attitude problem is caused by your drinking.\\" On August 10, 1998, he appeared on the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE)'s Monday Night Raw is War television program, where he was featured with Val Venis. later referenced in Past Inductions Not long after, he moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, where he worked as a bartender, limo driver, mover, pizza delivery driver, and tow-truck operator. He also had a stint serving at a wedding chapel as a minister of a Universal Life Church there. In 1999, Bobbitt received probation for his role in a theft at a store in Nevada. In 2003, he was sentenced to prison for violating his probation for the 1999 theft, after he was arrested on battery charges involving his then-wife, Joanna Ferrell. He was again twice arrested on charges of battery against Ferrell in 2004, and that same year, he filed for divorce under the name John W. Ferrell, which he had been using during his marriage with Ferrell. In 2014, he was severely injured when he broke his neck in a vehicular accident in Buffalo, New York.  Lorena  After the trial, Lorena attempted to keep a low profile and reverted to the use of her birth name, Gallo. In October 1996, she made a visit to her native Ecuador, where she met with then president Abdal√° Bucaram for an official dinner. Some time later the two would baptize a child as a godmother and a godfather. Bucaram was criticized for inviting Lorena to the dinner. In December 1997, she made news when she was charged with assault for punching her mother, Elvia Gallo, as they watched television. She was eventually acquitted of assault, and her mother continued to live with her. In 2007, she was working at a beauty salon in Washington, D.C. and in the same year founded Lorena's Red Wagon organization, which helps prevent domestic violence through family-oriented activities. In June 2008, she appeared on the CBS News program The Early Show, where she talked about her life since the incident. In the interview, she said that she was in a long-term relationship with Dave Bellinger and that they had a two-and-a-half-year-old daughter.  Joint public appearance  Although Lorena told Oprah Winfrey in April 2009 that she had no interest in talking to John, they appeared together on the show The Insider in May 2009. It was their first meeting since their divorce. On the show, he apologized to her for the way he treated her during their marriage. Lorena claimed that he still loved her because he continued to send her Valentine's Day cards and flowers.  Legacy and depiction in popular culture  The Bobbitt case brought attention to the issue of domestic violence and marital rape. Within days of the incident, anti-domestic violence advocates and some feminist groups rallied around Lorena, citing the alleged continuous abuse she suffered at the hands of John that caused her to attack him, albeit in an unusual and violent manner. Media attention surrounding the case resulted in national debate and also sparked a flurry of jokes, limericks, T-shirt slogans, advertising gimmicks, as well as Howard Stern having John Bobbitt as a guest on his 1993 New Year's Eve special and fundraising $250,000 to defray the outstanding costs of his surgery. MCI had also unknowingly been drawn into the fray by running a TV commercial a couple of weeks after the incident, advertising how the Bobbitts‚Äîa family from Siasconset, Massachusetts, of no relation to John and Lorena Bobbitt‚Äîsaved by switching to MCI, causing jokes to be made of \\"when they cut off your service, they mean it\\".Newsweek January 2, 1994 \\"He, She and the Celebrity\\". \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic's song \\"Headline News\\", a parody of the Crash Test Dummies hit \\"Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm\\", mentions the incident. Shortly after the incident, episodes of \\"Bobbittmania\\", or copycat crimes, were reported, although the incidents were generally self-inflicted wounds, or accidents. The names of John and Lorena Bobbitt eventually became synonymous with penis removal. The terms \\"Bobbittized punishment\\" and \\"Bobbitt Procedure\\" gained social recognition. The Bobbitt worm, which attacks its prey with scissor-like jaws, is named after the case. In February 2019, Amazon released Lorena, a four-part docu- series produced by Jordan Peele about the incident, which features interviews with both Lorena and John. On May 25, 2020, Lifetime aired I Was Lorena Bobbitt as part of its \\"Ripped from the Headlines\\" feature films. While Lorena Bobbitt serves as the onscreen narrator and executive producer, the film stars Dani Montalvo as Lorena Bobbitt and Luke Humphrey as John Bobbitt.

The memorial was completed in 1927 and officially unveiled by Viscount Allenby on 11 November 1929. No Catholic organisations participated in the formal unveiling ceremony, but veterans from the 16th (Irish) Division laid a wreath after the ceremony ended, and participated the following year. In addition to the usual Remembrance Sunday services, there are also annual ceremonies to remember the first day of the Battle of the Somme on 1 July.

In Kahn and Saks (1984) it was shown there exist a tight information-theoretical lower bound for sorting under partially ordered information up to a multiplicative constant. In the first super-linear lower bound for the noisy broadcast problem was proved. In a noisy broadcast model, n+1 processors P_0,P_1,\\\\ldots,P_n are assigned a local input bit x_i. Each processor may perform a noisy broadcast to all other processors where the received bits may be independently flipped with a fixed probability. The problem is for processor P_0 to determine f(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n) for some function f. Saks et al. showed that an existing protocol by Gallager was indeed optimal by a reduction from a generalized noisy decision tree and produced a \\\\Omega(n\\\\log(n)) lower bound on the depth of the tree that learns the input.

Biography  Ambrose T. Hartman was born in Middle River, Maryland, the son of Ambrose J. and Catherine McNamara Hartman. He graduated from Towson Catholic High School in 1943 after which he immediately enlisted in the Army. He served in the Army for 2¬Ω years during World War II with the 29th Division's 175th Infantry which landed at Normandy on June 7, 1944. He was awarded the Bronze Star for meeting the standards for \\"courage and discipline between July 1944 and March 1945,\\" and a Purple Heart after being wounded.Maryland Historical Society 1771 At the end of the war, he returned to Baltimore and attended the University of Maryland on the GI Bill.Rassmussen 2009; Zorsi 1993 In 1951 he graduated with honors from the University of Maryland Law SchoolUniversity of Maryland Catalog 23 He clerked under Maryland Attorney General Hall HammondMaryland Lawyer's Manual 1953 (erroneously listed as \\"Ambrose T. Hartnett\\") and became an assistant attorney general in 1953. In 1955, Mr. Hartman left the attorney general's office and joined the Baltimore law firm of Semmes, Bowen and Semmes. Four years later left private practice to accept a job as Deputy City Solicitor under Harrison L. Winter, who later became chief judge of the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. He was one of the youngest men ever to be appointed to the job.Lukas 1961 In 1961, he once again left city government when he joined the law firm of Miles & Stockbridge but returned to City Hall during the administration of Republican Mayor Theodore R. McKeldin in 1964. After becoming mayor in 1967, Thomas J. D'Alesandro III put Mr. Hartman in charge of overseeing the city's legislation before the General Assembly in Annapolis. From 1968 to 1993, Mr. Hartman continued working as the Deputy City Solicitor for Baltimore, never rising to the position of City Solicitor. When asked about his career trajectory by Mayor Kurt Schmoke, Mr. Hartman replied: \\"Always a bridesmaid, never a bride.\\" During his lengthy legal career, Mr. Hartman worked for three attorneys general, five city solicitors and six mayors.Rasmussen 2009  The Cases  Hartman's first victory as assistant attorney general was an Anne Arundel County criminal appeal before the U.S. Supreme Court in October 1953. The Defendant maintained the evidence was a result of an illegal search and seizure, but the Court disagreed and the Defendant's conviction on a gambling misdemeanor held.Salsburg v. State of Maryland, 346 U.S. 545; 74 S. Ct. 280; 98 L. Ed. 281 (1954). The next year, Mr. Hartman, who was a part of the state's team of lawyers, gained additional fame when he argued successfully before the Court of Appeals that George Edward Grammer had received a fair trial. Grammer had been convicted of killing his wife, Dorothy May Grammer in 1952.Grammer v. State of Maryland, 203 Md. 200; 100 A.2d 257(1953) The sensational murder trial resulted in Grammer being the penultimate person to be hanged in Maryland when he was executed at the Maryland Penitentiary on June 11, 1954.Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services As Deputy City Solicitor under Russell, Hartman successfully argued several cases for the City. One of the more notable cases involved the taxing of air rights. In Macht v. Department of Assessments, the Court of Appeals allowed the City to tax the value of airspace over property owned by the Machts.Macht and Macht v. Department of Assessments of Baltimore City, 266 Md. 602; 296 A.2d 162 (1972). Concurrent with this case, Hartman also argued a competitive bidding suit in the Court of Appeals. The Appellants maintained that the contract between the City and Monsanto for the construction of a pyrolysis plant was null as City did not solicit competitive bidding. The Court sided with the City stating: \\"Where the thing sought to be obtained by a municipality can by its nature be furnished by one and only one source, competition simply is not possible, so that charter requirement for competitive bidding can be ignored in such a case.\\"Hylton v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 268 Md. 266; 300 A.2d 656 (1972). Hartman's victory was not a boon to the City, however, as the plant was constructed at almost double the proposed cost and failed to operate per terms of the contract.Memo to Clarence D. Long, author unknown During his career, Mr. Hartman was a key player in devising the forerunner of the \\"piggyback\\" income tax, and he successfully defended before the state's highest court the financing innovations that helped usher in the City's renaissance.Zorzi 1993  Retirement  At the time of his retirement in 1993, Mr. Hartman stated: \\"I've gotten a lot of satisfaction in performing public service ... and shaping the direction of city government. But after all these years ... I'm leaving while I'm still in good health and can enjoy life.\\" In 1996, Mr. Hartman and his wife of 44 years moved to Keowee, South Carolina, where he joined the Salem Lions Club and volunteered with the organization's mobile vision screening unit.

In 1981‚Äì1985 Gosha studied at the theater art school of the Bolshoi Theater. He joined the Detsky Sad (Kindergarten) group of avant-garde artists in 1984 along with Georgy Litichevsky, Andrei Roiter, German Vinogradov and Nikolai Filatov. In 1985, Ostretsov also joined the Novye Khudozhniki (New Artists) group in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), which also included Timur Novikov, Oleg Kotelnikov, Sergei Bugayev-Africa, Ivan Sotnikov and other artists. In 1988 Ostretsov went to Paris, France, where he worked in the fashion industry and advertising. There he took up theology and iconography, which had a distinct influence on his subsequent works. While doing a project called Personal Superhero in 1996, Ostretsov met French gallerist Emmanuel Javogue, who introduced him to the Paris artistic community. In 1998 Gosha Ostretsov brought his Personal Superhero to the Second International Photobiennale in Moscow, and decided to stay in Russia. In 1999 he created a major new project, New Government, which made its debut appearance at the Marat Guelman gallery. The New Government ideas and characters were further developed in Ostretsov's other works. Gosha Ostretsov married Liudmila Konstantinova, a Moscow artist, in 2007. They have four children. In 2010, he created an association of contemporary artists called VGLAZ. The group includes Georgy Litichevsky, Liudmila Konstantinova, Olga Bozhko, Dmitry Bulnygin, Irina Korina, Natalya Struchkova, Ivan Tuzov, the EliKuka group, and many others. VGLAZ and Artika project Company are working on a project of public studios designed to help artists.

She participated in a number of actions and captured several privateers in the Mediterranean during the Napoleonic Wars. The Navy sold her in 1827. In 1829 she reappeared as the British Southern Whale Fisheries whaler Diana. Diana made three voyages for Daniel Bennett & Son until condemned after an on-board explosion in April 1843 towards the end of her fourth voyage. Napoleonic Wars In 1805 Scout was under Commander D. H. Mackay. On 4 October , , and Scout left Portsmouth together as they escorted a convoy of 33 merchant vessels on its way to Gibraltar. However, on 13 October, Scout and three merchant vessels left the convoy to go to Oporto. As a result, Scout arrived at Gibraltar two days after the Battle of Trafalgar. Commander William Raitt assumed command in February 1806. On the morning of 27 March 1807, off Cadiz, Scout, engaged the Spanish felucca privateer Admiral, out of Tarifa, under the command of Sebastian Boralta. Scout saw the ship about an hour before it anchored, but was five hours getting within cannon range. As Scout approached, Admiral fired the two 24-pounder guns she carried in her bows, but the crew of Admiral were forced to cut her anchor cable and run her onshore within 10 minutes of the start of return fire. Evidently pierced by the Scouts shots, Admiral began filling with water. The strong surf prevented Scout from sending her boats to capture Admiral, but by the time Riatt sailed in the next day the felucca had wrecked completely. As well as the two 24-pounders in her bow, Admiral had carried two 6-pounder guns and six 12-pounder carronades. Reportedly, she also had had a crew of 90-100 men.United service magazine (1833) February, Part 1, p.272. On 10 May Scout captured a Spanish settee, St. Antonio Abad, of nine men and 20 tons burthen. She was sailing from Marabella to Ceuta with a cargo of bricks, leather and the like. Two days later, Scout captured a Spanish brig carrying bale goods and loaf sugar. Late on 21 May 1807, Raitt sent his boats and those of in pursuit of several vessels spotted sailing past Cape Trafalgar with the aim of clearing the Straits under cover of darkness. The boats succeeded in capturing the privateer San Francisco Settaro (or Francisco Solano, or Determinada).United service magazine (1807), p.422. The privateer fired heavily on the boats before they captured her, killing one seaman from Scout, and wounding another. San Francisco Settaro was armed with one 18-pounder gun in her bow and two other carriage guns, together with swivels and small arms, and had a crew of 29 men. Raitt described his prize \\"a large Vessel, about Three Months old, and in my Opinion well calculated for the Gun Boat Service at Gibraltar.\\" On 13 June Scout and her sister-ship chased three vessels into the Barbate river. Raitt sent boats from both Scout and Redwing to destroy the vessels, which consisted of a Spanish privateer, a Letter of Marque, and a felucca. The Spanish privateer was the De Bonne Vassallio, of one 24-pounder and two 6-pounder guns. She had a crew of 42 men, all but four of whom escaped ashore. The only British casualty was one man whom a splinter injured when the privateer blew up. The boarding party also captured two signal posts, together with their flags. On 21 June Scout captured Fair American. That same day, Scout was off Lagos in the Algarve with Major General Spencer on board. From her deck he wrote to Viscount Castlereagh with a brief history of the Spanish insurrection. Four days earlier he had written congratulations from the on the surrender of the French fleet at Cadiz to the Spanish. On 11 September Scout captured the Danish ships Gode Haab, Jacob Kielland and Son, and Anna. Then on 20 October Scout detained the Russian ship Bella Aurora. On 4 April 1808 Scout captured the American ship Mary Alice. At the end of the year, on 7 December, Scout joined Vice-Admiral Lord Collingwood's squadron off Toulon. Early on 14 June 1809, near Cape Croisette south of Marseilles, Raitt encountered a convoy of 14 Spanish merchant vessels and two gunboats. Scout set off in pursuit but after the wind dropped in the afternoon Raitt had to continue the pursuit using his boats. The convoy dispersed as seven of the vessels headed for a small nearby harbour. Scouts boats went in under fire from a shore battery. A landing party captured the battery, spiking the two 6-pounder guns there. The boats then captured and sailed out the seven Spanish vessels. British casualties were one man killed and five wounded.James (1837), Vol. 6, p.171. The Spanish vessels were carrying wool, grain, leather, flour and cheese. Raitt destroyed two of the vessels after removing their cargoes; the five others he sent to Port Mahon. A landing party from Scout made a similar attack on a battery at Carry-le-Rouet, some 20 miles west of Marseilles on 14 July. The landing party captured the fort and spiked the guns. In the attack the British killed five enemy soldiers and captured seven, without suffering any loss themselves. At some point in 1809 Commander T. Stamp took temporary command of Scout. In the middle of August, Scout put into Gibraltar to repair damage. She had encountered in the Gulf of Genoa two French privateers, one of 20 guns and one of 18 guns. Scout repelled the two enemy vessels, but lost six men killed and 25 wounded in the engagement.Lloyd's List, n¬∞4387 - accessed 28 September 2015. In October 1809 Commander Alexander Renton Sharpe replaced Raitt. Between 30 October and 1 November Scout was part of Hallowell's squadron at the Bay of Rosas. On 30 October, boats from Scout joined with boats from , , Volontaire, , , , and Tuscan in a cutting out attack after a squadron off the south of France chased an enemy convoy into the Bay of Rosas in the Battle of Maguelone. The convoy had lost its escorting ships of the line, and , ran aground and scuttled by their crew near Frontignan, but were nevertheless heavily protected by an armed storeship of 18 guns, two bombards and a xebec. Some of the British boats took heavy casualties in the clash, but neither Scout nor her sister-ship Philomel suffered any losses. By the following morning the British had accounted for all eleven vessels in the bay, burning those they did not bring out. In January 1813, prize money was awarded to the British vessels that took part in the action for the capture of the ships of war Gromlire and Normande, and of the transports Dragon and Indien. A court declared a joint captor. Head money was also paid for Grondire and Normande and for the destruction of Lemproye and Victoire. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"1 Nov. Boat Service 1809\\" to all surviving claimants from the action. On 26 June 1810, Scout and captured Fortune. On 30 April 1811, Scout, together with Unite and , found three French ships laden with wood for the naval arsenal at Toulon that had taken refuge in the Bay of Sagone on Corsica's east coast. The French vessels were anchored under the protection of a shore battery of four guns and a mortar, a Martello tower armed with a gun overlooking the battery, and some 200 troops with field pieces, assisted by armed local inhabitants, all on a heights overlooking the vessels. The French vessels were Giraffe, of 26 guns, , of 24 guns, and the armed merchant vessel Henriette. The next day Captain Robert Barrie of Pomone had boats from Pomone and Scout tow their ships close to the French vessels. After a 90-minute engagement, Giraffe and Nourrice caught fire. (French records report that their crews set the two vessels on fire to prevent their being captured and then abandoned them.) Brands from Nourrice set fire to the merchant vessel. Barrie had the British withdraw, awaiting the explosion of the French vessels. The battery and the tower fell silent. Shortly thereafter the Giraffe exploded, and then so did Nourrice. Some of the timbers from Nourrice fell on the tower, demolishing it, with further sparks setting fire to the shore battery, which also blew up. With nothing left to accomplish, the British withdrew. The action cost the British two men killed and 25 wounded, including three men wounded on Scout. French casualties were six dead and 30 wounded. In October 1811, Scout left Gibraltar for England. However, a squall carried away her main boom and winds forced her back. Once she was repaired she sailed again, carrying dispatches. In 1812 Commander G.W. Hooper replaced Sharpe, and in 1813 Benjamin Crispin replaced Hooper. In January 1813 Commander James Murray was appointed to command Scout,though it may have taken some time for the change of command to be effective. On 17 February Scout captured the French privateer Fortune (or Fortuna) off Cagliari in the Strait of Bonifacio. Fortune was armed with three guns and carried 36 men; she was three days out of Tunis. One of the prize money announcements for the capture of \\"Buova La Fortuna\\" gives the name of Scout's commander as Crispin. On 23 July, Scout, with and , captured the American ship Violet. James Murray may not have assumed command until December 1813. Post-war In 1815 Scout was in Spithead. On 19 January Scout saved the doghter Alida. In July, Lieutenant Samuel Hellard of Scout faced a court martial. The charges were that he had threatened to shoot or drown a seaman who had deserted Scout, if the seaman ever returned, and that he had shown disrespect to Murray. The court-martial board severely reprimanded Hellard and moved his name to the bottom of the lieutenant's list.Marshall (1823-1835), p.360. In 1816 to 1817 Scout was in Deptford. In April 1818 she sailed for the Mediterranean under Commander William Ramsden, late of Ferret. By October 1821 she was under Commander John Theed, and at Chatham. In June 1822 Commander James Wigston took command of Scout and sailed her to the West Indies. On 3 November she captured the \\"piratical vessel\\" Amazon and the 46 men aboard her. Scout then suffered damage from stranding in May 1823 in the Gulf of Mexico. She might have been lost if , Lieutenant John Cawley, had not rendered assistance.Marshall (1832), Vol.3, Part 2, p.154. Disposal: Scout was paid off in 1825. The \\"Principal Officers and commissioners of His Majesty's Navy\\" offered \\"Scout brig, of 382 tons\\", lying at Portsmouth, for sale on 11 July 1827. She sold on that day for ¬£1,010 to John Small Sedger for breaking up. Whaler Scout reappeared in 1829 as the ship Diana, launched at Hull in 1804. She appeared in Lloyd's Register (LR) with J.Palmer, master, Bennett, owner, and trade London‚ÄìSouth Seas. She had undergone a large repair in 1829.LR (1829), Supple.pages \\"D\\", Seq.‚ÑñD21. 1st whaling voyage (1829‚Äì1832) Captain Palmer sailed from London on 5 May 1829, bound for the waters off New Zealand. Diana was reported at the Bay of Islands, Tongatabu, Honolulu, and Guam. She arrived back at England on 22 April 1832. She had more than 1300 barrels of whale oil.British Southern Whale Fishery Database ‚Äì Voyages: Diana. 2nd whaling voyage (1832‚Äì1835) Captain Heriot (or Harriet, or Hariot) sailed from London on 31 July 1832, bound for Timor and the seas off Japan.

She was reported at Lombok, Timor, and the Bay of Islands. She returned to England on 7 July 1839 with 420 casks of whale oil. Fate Captain James May sailed from England on 26 August 1839. Diana was reported at Mauritius and Coupang. At some point the mate murdered May. She was at Saint Helena on her way home when an explosion took place on board her on 26 April 1843 that caused a great deal of damage and killed at least eight crew members. She was condemned on 29 April. The origins of the explosion were unclear.

Vietnam War Connection On July 8, 1959, while watching The Tattered Dress, five US Army officers became the first American casualties of the Vietnam War. The Viet Cong attacked the mess hall where Dale R. Buis, Chester M. Ovnand and three other officers were watching the movie. M/Sgt Ovnand, who was in charge of the projector, switched on the lights to change to the next reel, when Viet Cong guerrillas poked their weapons through the windows and sprayed the room with automatic weapons fire. M/Sgt Ovnand was hit with several 9mm rounds. He immediately switched the lights off and headed to the top of the stairs, where he was able to turn on the exterior flood lights. He died from his wounds on the stairs. Major Buis, at that time, was crawling towards the kitchen doors. When the exterior flood lights came on, he must have seen an attacker coming through the kitchen doors. He got up and rushed towards attacker, but was only able to cover 15 feet (4.6 m) before being fatally hit from behind. His actions startled the attacker who was about to throw his satchel charge through the door. The attacker's satchel charge had already been activated and his moment of hesitation allowed the satchel charge to explode, killing him. Two South Vietnamese guards that were on duty that night were also killed by the Viet Cong. The wounded were, Captain Howard Boston (MAAG 7) and the Vietnamese cook's eight-year-old son.

The film was released in June 1958 as a double feature with The Colossus of New York. The character Eadie Johnson is portrayed by actor Sandy Descher, who had previous science-fiction film experience when she played the catatonic child in Warner Bros. Them! (1954). Plot Dave and Anne Brewster, with their sons Bud and Ken, arrive at the main gate of a seaside trailer park that houses the personnel working with the military to complete the Thunderer, a huge rocket that will place an atomic device in permanent Earth orbit. Dave Brewster is a technician who works for the company that provided parts for the top-secret Thunderer project, which will allow the USA to strike back within minutes at any nation that attacks America. The orbiting atomic device can be brought down on a selected city by remote control. Seven children from various families, who live in the trailer park and are involved with the secret project, meet on the beach and become friends. While playing together, the kids observe a strange beam of light shining down onto a rocky section of the beach about a mile away. As they watch, a small, glowing object slowly floats down amid the beam and disappears among the rocks. As they watch the glowing object descend, Bud Brewster (Michel Ray) behaves as if he is listening to a voice only he can hear. He smiles and nods several times, showing no fear or confusion despite the strange situation. That evening, after a community cookout involving all the parents and kids, the seven kids ask permission to take a walk on the beach. They head directly to a place among the rocks along the beach where they encounter a small, glowing, alien life form shaped somewhat like a human brain, resting on the sand. The kids' behavior clarifies that they are receiving the alien's thoughts and they all understand that Bud Brewster has been designated their leader as they perform a vital task for the glowing alien. Bud and his brother Ken (Johnny Crawford) return to their trailer and tell their parents about the alien. Dave Brewster becomes angry, believing that his son is lying to excuse the fact that Ken and he stayed out so late and worried their parents, but when Dave grabs Bud in a threatening way, his arm is suddenly paralyzed. Bud calmly explains that all the kids and he are under the alien's protection. Confused by the situation, but convinced now that his sons are not lying, Dave accompanies six of the kids back to the alien's rocky hideout. The seventh, Tim Gamble (Johnny Washbrook), is roughly accosted by his drunken, abusive stepfather Joe (Russell Johnson). Tim breaks away and runs after the group, but Joe chases him, shouting violent threats of severe punishment. Joe catches up with Tim and throws him to the ground, then picks up a piece of driftwood and raises it to strike him savagely. Just then, the alien, shown in its hiding place among the rocks, suddenly blazes with light. Joe is thrown backwards forcefully, saving Tim. Terrified, Joe flees the scene. Moments later, Tim joins the other children and Dave as they arrive at the alien's lair. Acting on its instructions, which it silently conveys to Bud, Dave gently carries the alien back to the trailer. Once there, Bud explains to his parents that they must keep the alien safe until the following evening, but he does not explain why. His mother Anne (Peggy Webber) is understandably frightened for her family's safety because of the possible threat this bizarre being from space might pose. When Tim Gamble enters his own family's trailer, he finds Joe Gamble's dead body just as an ambulance arrives. In the next trailer, Bud and Ken tell their parents that the alien killed Joe because he threatened Tim's life. The next morning, the Brewsters discover that the alien has doubled in size, now measuring several feet across. Dave Brewster receives a phone call from the base where the Thunderer is located, informing him that the rocket will be launched that night. Anne and he realize that the alien's purpose on Earth is somehow connected to the launch of the Thunderer. While Dave is still on the phone, Bud and Ken are shown carrying the alien out and taking it to a cave along the beach. Dave knows he must alert the authorities, and he hurries to the base to warn them about the possible threat from the alien. When he meets with Dr. Wahrman (David Bair) and Colonel Manley (Richard Shannon), though, his voice is suddenly paralyzed, and he passes out when he tries desperately to write a message. During the next few hours, the children are shown quietly moving about the base, performing mysterious tasks while the alien exerts mental control over various people and objects, such as sentries and locked gates, to ensure that the children's secret mission is carried out. Dr. Wahrman visits Dave Brewster in the infirmary; now fully recovered, Dave discovers that he is able to tell Dr. Wahrman about the alien. Wahrman realized that he, too, will be prevented from speaking to others about the alien, so the two men drive out to the cave in which the alien is now located. The alien has grown even larger, an unearthly mass of slowly pulsating tissue, glowing with an eerie light whose brightness varies from moment to moment. Dr. Wahrman tries to communicate with the alien, hoping to learn what it is directing the children to do, but the alien remains silent. Wahrman and Brewster give up and rush back to the base just as the Thunderer is about to be launched. They both realize that the alien will stop them from even trying to interfere. When the countdown reaches zero and the launch button is pressed, an explosion within the nose cone destroys the nuclear warhead, rendering the Thunderer useless; the children have succeeded in sabotaging the warhead. Wahrman orders the soldiers to follow him back to the cave, where they confront the seven children as they calmly stand shoulder-to-shoulder, blocking the cave's entrance. Suddenly, the huge alien mass glides majestically out of the cave behind the children and rises up into the sky. As the adults gaze upward to watch the alien ascend on a beam of light like the one that brought it to Earth, Dr. Wahrman asks Bud why the Thunderer was destroyed. Bud tells the adults that his group did what other groups of children have done in several other countries; they sabotaged the rockets that would have carried dangerous nuclear devices into space, making humankind's self-destruction too easy if such devices were ever used. The aliens were concerned about humankind's welfare, so they relied on teams of loyal children all over the world to prevent humankind from making a terrible mistake.

It was loosely based on The Egg, an unpublished story by Tom Filer (involving a girl with polio) that was significantly different from the final plot of the film. The alien brain was created by special-effects artist Ivyl Burks and used $3,300 of neon lights to create its glowing effect. Theatrical release The Space Children was first released in theaters on June 18, 1958, as part of a double bill with The Colossus of New York, also produced by Alland. Home media The Space Children was released on DVD in 2006 as part of the Lost Movie Classics Collection by RoDon Enterprises. In 2012, a combo Blu ray/DVD was released by Olive Films.

After that, Polish king Casimir IV, whose Oporowski's was a strong supporter of, proposed Oporowski's candidature. The candidature passed, although not without objections from the metropolitan chapter. Oporowski's reign as the archbishop and primate was rather controversial. Soon after he was elected as archbishop and primate, he ordered that all gifts and nominations given out by his predecessor are to be taken back. He further offended local church officials by refusing to participate in the traditional ingres (welcoming) in the Gniezno Cathedral, and finally accused many of them of corruption and financial misappropriation following primate's Kot's death. One of his chief political opponents was cardinal Zbigniew Ole≈õnicki, whose nomination to cardinal few years back was vocally opposed by Oporowski.Natalia Nowakowska, Church, state and dynasty in Renaissance Poland: the career of Cardinal Fryderyk Jagiellon (1468-1503), Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007, , Google Print, p.24 Oporowski rarely stayed in Gniezno, instead preferring his family seat at Opor√≥w. He was not very interested in the issues of the Gniezno diocese; instead he was focused on improving his own political power and wealth. In Opor√≥w, he oversaw the construction of the Opor√≥w Castle.Neal Bedford, Poland, Lonely Planet, 2008, , Print, p.134 He died on 11 March 1453 in the Opor√≥w Castle, and was buried in the local church.

The film stars Bob Denver as Dusty, the bumbling assistant to Wagonmaster Callahan featured in the syndicated series Dusty's Trail. The film itself consists of four episodes of Dusty's Trail edited together: \\"Tomahawk Territory\\", \\"Horse of Another Color\\", \\"There Is Nothing Like a Dame\\", and \\"The Not So Magnificent Seven\\". Plot summary A stagecoach and covered wagon heading west across the plains become separated from their wagon train thanks to Dusty (Denver), a bumbling assistant to Wagonmaster Callahan (Forrest Tucker). Lost in the wilderness, seven hapless souls must now make their way to California on their own using what brains they have or haven't got. First, the characters meet Indians. Then there is a \\"necktie party\\" looking to hang Dusty as a horse thief. Third, a couple of cattle rustlers want to \\"get friendly\\" with some willing females. And finally, a \\"shootout\\" takes place, with Dusty dressed up as Bat Masterson in a ghost town setting. Home media The Wackiest Wagon Train in the West was released on VHS by JTC, Inc., Front Row Video, Inc. and Direct Source Special. The film has also been released on Region 1 DVD by numerous companies including Tango Entertainment, Digiview and St. Clair Vision. These releases by numerous budget labels were due to the fact that the copyrights on most episodes of Dusty's Trail were never properly claimed, making the series one of the last television series to enter the public domain before the Copyright Act of 1976 (and its much longer copyright terms) took effect. As the film was sourced from this series, the film itself is also in the public domain.

Founded in Brompton, near Chatham, Kent in 1868, the business subsequently moved to Aldershot, where they were based until closure in November 1981 after the company had been bought by media mogul Robert Maxwell. Early years Premises of Gale and Polden in Brompton The firm of Gale and Polden was founded near Brompton Barracks at Chatham, James Gale opening his bookshop there at No 1 High Street, Old Brompton in 1868. Soon Gale acquired his first printing press, which he set up in a wooden shed in the garden at the rear of his house. Through his contacts with the Headquarters of the Chatham Military District Gale obtained a printing contract for the printing of the Garrison Directory.Gale and Polden, Printers of Aldershot on the Hampshire County Council website In 1873 Gale printed and published his first book, Campaign of 1870‚Äì1: The Operations of the Corps of General V. Werder by Ludwig Lohlein, late Captain 1st Baden Bodyguard Grenadier Regiment. At this time Gale's printing works had three hand presses and only enough metal type to print sixteen pages at a time. Gale's staff was made up of three compositors, a bookbinder, a die stamper and three boys. His wife managed the shop's book and stationery sales, assisted by one of the boys. Composing department at Gale and Polden's Wellington Works in Aldershot c.1915 On 29 September 1875 James Gale took on his first apprentice, William T Nash, aged fourteen. Nash went on to work for the Company for sixty-eight years, rising to be Composing Room Overseer, a post he held for nearly forty years until 1943 when he died aged 82. In 1875 Nash was soon joined by Thomas Ernest Polden, aged 16. By 1880 the bookselling side of Gale's business was very successful, and Gale publicised it by announcing that \\"A selection of several hundreds of most modern and popular books will always be found in stock and, having made arrangements for receiving parcels from the principal London Houses daily, the book that should not happen to be in stock could be obtained immediately\\". Many of these developments were due to T. Ernest Polden, who had progressed from serving in the bookshop into working in the printing works where he gained an extensive knowledge of different printing processes. Polden went out from Chatham to the garrisons or dockyards at Gravesend, Dover, Canterbury and further afield, publicising the name Gale and Polden to the British Army and Navy. At that time most official military forms were written out in longhand by orderlies, and Polden saw an opportunity to extend the firm's business by printing standardised forms. His scheme resulted in large orders for the forms being placed. Expansion Large letterpress machines at work at Gale and Polden in Aldershot preparing the text for the printing presses c.1915 Small printing machines inside Gale and Polden's Wellington Works in Aldershot c.1915 Polden, by now the senior partner in the business, decided to establish a London Office. \\"A Company of our standing and associations\\", he declared \\"must have its centre in the hub of the Empire!\\" The business had increased to such an extent that James Gale and T. Ernest Polden were considering forming Gale & Polden into a limited liability Company registered in London. At that time Fleet Street, St. Paul's Churchyard and Paternoster Row were the centre of publishing in London, and it was here that T. Ernest Polden looked for an office for the growing company. In 1892 he found suitable premises at No. 2, Amen Corner. At first the company had two rooms on the third floor, but this soon increased to four and gradually they took over the entire building. By this time the company were supplying printed forms and other stationery to about 400 military canteens, 100 officers' messes, 200 sergeants' messes, and 250 libraries, recreation rooms and regimental institutes throughout both the Army and Navy. The well-known Gale & Polden Military Series and other educational works were in use by Military Educational Department and by the London and other school boards, and in the colonial forces. On 10 November 1892 the company was incorporated as Gale & Polden Ltd, with a share capital of ¬£30,000 in ¬£5 shares. Unusually, the shares were offered to ordinary soldiers. Move to Aldershot Polden suggested to the board of directors that it was necessary to build a new factory at Aldershot, then the largest British Army base in Great Britain, and close the Brompton Works. Polden had located a suitable site in Aldershot for the building of the new factory in an ideal position near to the town's railway station. It was originally planned to have a four-sided building with a central courtyard. By September 1893 the first wing was complete, and two high-powered gas engines with electrical generating plant were installed. The larger printing machines were kept running at the Brompton Works until the new building at Aldershot was ready to receive them. Then the machines at Brompton were stripped down, loaded into Pickfords containers on horse-drawn drays, taken down to the railway goods siding at Chatham Station and sent to Aldershot in special trucks where they were unloaded and taken across to the new factory nearby. Later years Men of the Aldershot Volunteer Fire Brigade fight the blaze at Gale and Polden in 1918 The blue plaque on the former site of Gale and Polden In 1916 Gale & Polden were granted a Royal Warrant for producing Queen Mary's Christmas card. In 1918 a fire at the firm's Wellington Works destroyed one of the building's four wings, which temporarily halted printing. As a result of the fire, the company decided to maintain its own volunteer fire crew at the Works. In 1956 Gale & Polden acquired a number of smaller printing firms including Know Publications, producers of the Woking Opinion newspaper; Paines of Worthing and John Drew Ltd, an Aldershot-based rival. In 1963 Gale & Polden was taken over by the Purnell Group, and in 1964 Purnells merged with another printing company, Hazel Sun, to form the new British Printing Corporation (BPC), the largest printing company in Europe. In 1971 The Aldershot News was acquired by the Surrey Advertiser Group, which later became part of the Guardian Group of newspapers. Robert Maxwell gained control of BPC and Gale & Polden with it in 1981, and named his new Company Maxwell Communications. In November 1981 Gale & Polden finally closed, with the Wellington Works site being demolished in 1987. Robert Maxwell died in 1991 and in 1992 Maxwell Communications collapsed, leaving many retired Gale and Polden employees without a pension. On 6 June 2014 a commemorative blue plaque was unveiled on the block of flats which now stands on the site of the former print works. This was sponsored by Colonel David Strong TD, a local resident and a Gale and Polden historian.Blue Plaque for Gale and Polden Military Publishers and Printers - Great War Forum Gallery Image:gale and polden 2.jpgGale and Polden just before demolition Image:gale and polden 1.jpgSide view just before demolition References * Research and unpublished manuscript of Howard N.

It stars George Hamilton in the lead role of an international cat burglar and jewel thief. Plot A master thief known as the Ace of Diamonds decides it's time to retire before he gets caught, so he teaches everything he knows to Jeff Hill, his protege. Jeff begins pulling off heists, singling out glamorous film stars like Zsa Zsa Gabor, Carroll Baker and Lilli Palmer (portraying themselves in cameo roles) and stealing their precious jewels. On a luxury liner, Jeff, now nicknamed the \\"Jack of Diamonds\\", discovers he has a competitor aboard, another burglar pulling the same kinds of thefts. After the boat docks, Jeff goes to see the Ace, who advises him to do the same thing he did, quit while he's ahead. Jeff encounters a woman named Olga who introduces him to Nicolai, and after discovering that Olga was the other thief aboard ship, Jeff schemes with them to rob a bank vault in Paris. They are caught, but the Ace shows up and claims responsibility for the crime, sacrificing himself for Jeff and the others. The thieves agree to return the stolen jewels, but when Jeff and Olga decide to marry, Nicolai reveals he has withheld one gem to present Olga as a gift. Cast * George Hamilton as Jeff * Joseph Cotten as the Ace * Marie Lafor√™t as Olga * Maurice Evans as Nicolai * Zsa Zsa Gabor as Herself * Carroll Baker as Herself * Lilli Palmer as Herself Production The 1949 Paramount film about jewel thieves, Copper Canyon, was originally known as Jack of Diamonds. It is unclear whether this film has any connection with the George Hamilton film. The film was based on a story by the producer, Sandy Howard, who said before filming that the movie \\"may be reminiscent of other films, but we feel, even though we have no releasing deal as yet, that it will be different in style and its budget ‚Äì $1.3 million ‚Äì makes it an honest and safe bet.\\" The film was originally meant to be directed by Herschel Daugherty. Oscar Homolka was meant to play Nicolai but was replaced by Maurice Evans. The plan was to film in New York for a month and then 12 weeks in Europe in Paris, the Bavarian Alps, Genoa and a Munich studio. Producer Sandy Howard described George Hamilton before filming as \\"a fine actor, I'm convinced, and he's a hot commodity these days\\", due in part to the fact he was dating the President's daughter. Reports put his fee around this time at $100,000 a movie. He was drafted into the army but received a 3-A deferral notice on the grounds he was the sole financial provider for his mother. (Hamilton's draft deferment was highly controversial at the time because it was thought that his relationship with the president's daughter gave him preferential treatment.) Reception Reviews for the film were mixed to negative. In his review for the New York Times, Bosley Crowther wrote, \\"Unless you have a particularly urgent reason for wanting to watch George Hamilton modeling a dazzling assortment of the most beautifully cut men's clothes...you may safely skip Jack of Diamonds, which turned up in neighborhood theaters yesterday. It is strictly low-grade 'Topkapi' done up in expensive high-style. Roger Ebert wrote in his review, \\"Jack of Diamonds is a harmless exercise in how not to make a suspense adventure. I can't think of any reason to go and see it, unless you're a George Hamilton fan. He's pleasant enough, I guess.

She was the second daughter and fourth child of Mieszko III the Old, Duke of Greater Poland and since 1173 High Duke of Poland, by his first wife Elisabeth, daughter of King B√©la II of Hungary. Her name was probably given after High Duchess Viacheslava of Novgorod, wife of Boles≈Çaw IV the Curly, the ruling High Duke of Poland; with this gesture, Duke Mieszko III maybe showed an expression of warming relations between him and his brother the High Duke. Life Around 1167, Wierzchoslawa Ludmilla married with Frederick, Lord of Bitsch, second son of Duke Matthias I of Lorraine. The union was arranged by Frederick's maternal uncle Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor during a visit to Poland. During her marriage, Wierzchoslawa Ludmilla bore her husband nine children: *Frederick (who succeeded his father as Duke of Lorraine) *Matthias (later Bishop of Toul) *Philipp (Lord of Gerb√©viller) *Thierry (Lord of Autigny) *Henry (Lord of Bayon) *Agatha (Abbess of Remiremont) *Judith (Countess of Salm) *Hedwig (Countess of Zweibr√ºcken) and Cunigunde (Duchess of Limburg) Wierzchos≈Çawa Ludmilla became the contact between the French and Polish artistic representatives.

Then Frederick became the Duke of Lorraine and Wierzchos≈Çawa Ludmilla his duchess consort. However, their reign was short-lived: one year later, in 1206, Duke Frederick I died. Wierzchos≈Çawa Ludmilla returned to Poland after the death of her husband, and remained there until her own death, around 1223.

They are spoken in the central and southern parts of the Philippines, and in northern Sulawesi. This subgroup was first proposed by Robert Blust (1991) based on lexical and phonological evidence, and is accepted by most specialists in the field.Lobel, Jason William. (2013). Philippine and North Bornean languages: issues in description, subgrouping, and reconstruction. Ph.D. dissertation. Manoa: University of Hawai'i at Manoa.Reid, Lawrence A. (2018). \\"Modeling the linguistic situation in the Philippines.\\" In Let's Talk about Trees, ed. by Ritsuko Kikusawa and Lawrence A. Reid. Osaka: Senri Ethnological Studies, Minpaku. Most of the major languages of the Philippines belong to the Greater Central Philippine subgroup: Tagalog, the Visayan languages Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Waray; Central Bikol, Maranao and Magindanao. On the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, Gorontalo is the third-largest language by number of speakers. History According to Blust, the current distribution of the Greater Central Philippine languages is the result of an expansion that occurred around 500 B.C. and which led to levelling of much of the linguistic diversity in the central and southern Philippines. Remnants of this earlier diversity can still be found in relic areas within the Greater Central Philippine area, viz. Manide in southern Luzon, Ati on Panay, the North Mangyan languages on Mindoro, the Kalamian languages in northern Palawan and the South Mindanao languages. Classification The Greater Central Philippine subgroup comprises the following microgroups: *Central Philippine languages (including Tagalog, Bikol languages, and Visayan languages) *South Mangyan languages *Palawanic languages *Subanen languages *Danao languages (including Maranao and Magindanao) *Manobo languages *Gorontalo‚ÄìMongondow languages (including Gorontalo) See also *Philippine languages References External links *Philippine etyma file cards by R.

See definition here. or \\"prosperous journey\\"See possible alternative definition here.) and Syntyche (, \\"fortunate,\\" literally \\"with fate\\") are people mentioned in the New Testament. They were female members of the church in Philippi, and according to the text of Philippians 4: 2-3, they were involved in a disagreement together. The author of the letter, Paul the Apostle, whose writings generally reveal his misgivings that internal disunity will seriously undermine the church, beseeched the two women to \\"agree in the Lord\\". Euodia was the old name of a plant genus that has been changed to Tetradium. Gender confusion Despite the clear context and gender agreement of the original Greek text, the Authorised Version of the Bible incorrectly assigns Euodia the name \\"Euodias\\" (the male gender version of the name) and thus makes the quarrel appear to be between a man and a woman. According to some sources,See, for example, William Barclay, \\"The Letters to the Philippians, Colossians and Thessalonians\\", published by The St Andrew Press (Edinburgh), Revised Edition 1975, pages 72-73. there was a historical theory that Euodias (male) was the gaoler of Philippi (see Acts 16: 25-34) and Syntyche was his wife. This theory is rejected by modern scholarship, not least because of the clarity in the original text that both characters are female. As a Roman colony, Philippi gave a level of independence to women that was not common in most Greek cities of the period; this may account for the prominence of the women and their disagreement. There are references to a \\"Euodia\\" (again mistaking the name as a male form) in the document Apostolic Constitutions, which purports to be a set of writings of the twelve Apostles of Jesus, but is in fact a bogus source, dated to the fourth century AD, and believed to originate in Syria.wikipedia, \\"Apostolic Constitutions\\", (Global), 2014. Models of female leadership Not surprisingly, Euodia and Syntyche are chiefly remembered as two people who had an argument, and their names are most commonly associated with disagreement.As in the article Euodias - The woman who fell out with her friend. However, for some commentators, as also for some church institutions, there is further significance in the implied leadership role of the two women within the Philippian church. This leadership role, which some have suggested included ordained ministry, is taken to be implied both by Paul's interest in their argument, and by the language used by Paul in addressing their disagreement.See Euodia and Syntyche: Women Church Leaders at Philippi Marg Mowczko which discusses the women's roles as female church leaders. Unnamed arbitrator In an unsolved mystery, arising in verse 3 of the passage, Paul calls upon an unnamed individual, charging him to intervene directly to assist in ending the quarrel between Euodia and Syntyche. According to different translations, Paul addresses this person as \\"my true yokefellow\\" or \\"my true comrade\\". This has led to speculation about the identity of this helper. Timothy, Silas, and others have been suggested. Timothy may perhaps be considered less likely, as he is named in the introduction as a fellow author of the letter, with Paul (Philippians 1:1). Peter Toon, in his commentary, wrote \\"His identity is not known, but he was probably a respected and influential member of the church whose word would be heeded\\".Peter Toon, \\"Philippians\\" (Kingsway Bible Studies), Kingsway Publications (Eastbourne), 1979, page 27. William Barclay, after discussing various possible identities, states \\"Maybe the best suggestion is that the reference is to Epaphroditus, the bearer of the letter.\\"William Barclay, \\"The Letters to the Philippians, Colossians and Thessalonians\\", The St Andrew Press (Edinburgh), Revised Edition 1975, page 74. Conclusion of the argument The exact nature of the disagreement is unknown. Matthew Henry's Complete Commentary, to which sections on the epistles were added posthumously by the editors under George Burder, introduces a theory that the women's argument may have been jointly prosecuted by them against the wider church, although it also posits the more traditional view that they disagreed with one another. Either way, the commentary is clear that disagreement and disunity were undermining church life. There are no extant sources (biblical or otherwise) to suggest the outcome of the argument. Nonetheless, it is often cited in contemporary church life as part of a call to build unity within congregations and churches.

Christ Church became a cathedral in 1897 and remained so until 1944, when William Moody moved the cathedral to St. George chapel at the Cathedral Domain, a large camp in rural southeastern Kentucky. In 1989, the former bishop, Don A. Wimberly, moved the Cathedral back to Christ Church, reestablishing it as the cathedral of the diocese, where it remains so today. In 1976, Christ Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It qualified for inclusion both because of its architecture and because of its significance in the area's history.

Unique in its depth and breadth, instruction for the boys, girls and teens is based on the curriculum of the Royal School of Church Music. Children and youth deepen their sense of history, liturgy, language and art as well as their ability to interpret sacred texts and music. Through the ongoing effort of learning and working together, they also develop friendships and become part of a community that uplifts collective and individual efforts. Christ Church Cathedral choristers learn what it is to be at the heart of vibrant worship. The choirs have sung in residence at many of England's great Cathedrals including York Minster, Exeter, Canterbury, St. Paul's, Westminster Abbey and Lincoln. Additionally, the choir has recorded numerous times including the latest recording Sing We Merrily, released in November 2013. The Cathedral also supports a choir for women's and men's voices.

The organ is designed to play the entire repertoire convincingly, lead congregational hymn singing and accompany the unique sound of the Cathedral choirs. The organ includes several different and colorful flute stops, generously scaled and clear voiced principals, broad and bold reed tone and warm strings. The pedal division includes five stops at sixteen foot pitch. In 1999, the Holtkamp Organ Company, completely renovated the console, added solid state combination action, releathered the electro-pneumatic chests and added a new Festival Trumpet. The Buzard organ Company of Champaign, Illinois is the organ curator.

The project undertook a holistic approach to define a next generation multimedia processing architecture for embedded MPSoCs that targets programmability, performance scalability, and silicon efficiency in an evolutionary way. The evolutionary way implies using existing processor cores such as NXP TriMedia as building blocks and supporting industry programming standards such as POSIX threads. Based on the technology-aware design space exploration, the project concluded that hardware accelerators facilitating task management and coherency coupled with right dimensioning of compute cores deliver good programmability, scalable performance and competitive silicon efficiency. Research Ne-XVP architecture at the end of 2008. Two different core types core1 and core2 are used to construct a multicore processor. To increase performance density the multicore is supported by several accelerators for inter-thread synchronization and communication.

Both are found only in the Noailles Chansonnier (BnF fr.12615). The Lai de notre-dame (incipit: En entente curieuse) is ascribed to him in the manuscript, but the Lai de l'ancien et du nouveau testament (incipit: S'onques hom en lui s'asist) is presented anonymously and was only assigned to Ernoul by Alfred Jeanroy. David Fallows describes his two lais as \\"among the most unusual in the entire monophonic repertory, astonishingly long with complex repetition schemes and elaborate motivic structure.\\" Five pastourelles have also been attributed to Ernoul, and all are preserved only in the Chansonnier du Roi (BnF fr.844). The attribution of only one, En avril, au tens novel, is highly disputed. Though anonymous in the manuscript, modern scholars have disagreed whether it belongs to Ernoul's corpus, with one assigning it instead to Thibaut de Blaison. It has two lines that are identical to two found in Pensis, chief enclin, which is attributed in the manuscript to Ernoul but is incomplete. Musically it is unusual among Enroul's pieces for its less restricted style. Pensis, chief enclin later formed the basis of a motet with Flos filius eius. The only other pastourelle ascribed to Ernoul in the manuscript, Por conforter mon corage, was also used in a later motet, and its melody was used in another with Crescens incredulitas. Two further pastourelles, both incomplete and anonymous, have been assigned to Ernoul because they appear beside his other works and are similar in language and musical style: Quant voi le tans avrilier and Tres pensant d'une amourete.

She was a \\"leading spokeswoman for the Marxist-progressive-nationalist-feminist movement in the late 1940s and 1950s\\", as well as a \\"pioneer of modern Egyptian art\\" and \\"one of the important Egyptian visual artists\\". The activist Aflatoun was born in Cairo in 1924 into a traditional Muslim family she described as \\"semi-feudal and bourgeois\\", her father was an entomologist and a landowner, and her mother was a French-trained dress-designer who served in the Egyptian Red Crescent Society women's committee. She discovered Marxism at the Lyc√©e Fran√ßais du Caire . It was her private art tutor, Kamel el-Telmissany, who introduced her to the life and the struggles of the Egyptian peasants. Al-Timisani was one of the founders of the 'Art and Freedom Group,' a surrealist movement that would have an impact on Aflatoun's development as an artist. In 1942, she joined Iskra, a Communist youth party. After graduating from the Fuad I University in Cairo, she was, with Latifa al-Zayyat, a founding member in 1945 of the Rabitat Fatayat at jami'a wa al ma' ahid (League of University and Institutes' Young Women). The same year she represented the League at the first conference of Women's International Democratic Federation in Paris. She wrote Thamanun milyun imraa ma'ana (Eighty Million Women with Us) in 1948 and Nahnu al-nisa al-misriyyat (We Egyptian Women)translated in: in 1949. These popular political pamphlets linked class and gender oppression, connecting both to imperialist oppression. In 1949, she became a founding member of the First Congress of the First Peace Council of Egypt. She joined Harakat ansar al salam (Movement of the Friends of Peace) in 1950. She was arrested and secretly imprisoned during Nasser's roundup of communists in 1959. After her release in 1963, Egypt's Communist party having been dissolved, she devoted most of her time to painting. She later declared: \\"Nasser, although he put me in prison, was a good patriot.\\" Painting During school, Aflatoun liked to paint and her parents encouraged her. Her private art tutor, Kamel el- Telmissany, a leader in an Egyptian Surrealist collective called the Art and Freedom Group, introduced her to surrealist and cubist aesthetics. Her paintings of that period are influenced by surrealism. She later recalled that people were astonished by her paintings and wondered \\"why a girl from a rich family was so tormented\\". She stopped painting from 1946 to 1948, considering that what she was painting no longer corresponded to her feelings. Her interest was later renewed after visiting Luxor, Nubia, and the Egyptian oases. During these trips, she had the opportunity to \\"penetrate the houses and sketch men and women at work\\". She studied for a year with the Egyptian- born Swiss artist Margo Veillon During this period, she made individual exhibits in Cairo and Alexandria and showed at the Venice Biennale in 1952 and the S√£o Paulo Art Biennial in 1956. In 1956 she became friends with and was later influenced by the Mexican painter David Alfaro Siqueiros. She was able to continue painting during her imprisonment. Her early prison paintings are portraits, while the later are landscapes. In the years after her liberation, she exhibited in Rome and Paris in 1967, Dresden, East Berlin, Warsaw and Moscow in 1970, Sofia in 1974, Prague in 1975, New Delhi in 1979. Her paintings are filled with \\"lively brushstrokes of intense color\\" reminding some observers of Van Gogh or Bonnard. Her art of later years is characterised by an increasing use of large white spaces around her forms. A collection of her works is displayed at the Amir Taz Palace in Cairo. Another collection of her works is showcased at the Barjeel Art Foundation in Sharjah. Legacy A Google Doodle on 16 April 2019 commemorated Aflatoun's 95th birth anniversary.

The party, which called for immediate revolution in Japan, is not recognized by the present-day Japanese Communist Party as its predecessor. However, several former members of the party took part in the founding of the Japanese Communist Party in 1922.Beckmann, George M., and Genji Okubo. The Japanese Communist Party 1922‚Äì1945. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press, 1969. pp. 34, 49 Founding The party was founded by Kond≈ç Eiz≈ç on August 20, 1921 (Kondo had been released from jail in July the same year). The founding group of the party consisted of radical intellectuals, many of them former students of Waseda University and members of the Society of Enlightened People. The founding meeting, held in secret, adopted a party platform and constitution. An executive committee was elected (with Kondo as its chairman), as well as four other committees (Finance Committee, led by Nakasone Genwa; Investigation Committee, led by Hirata Shinsaku; Publication Committee, led by Takase Kiyoshi; Propaganda Committee, led by Takatsu Seido).Beckmann, George M., and Genji Okubo. The Japanese Communist Party 1922‚Äì1945. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press, 1969. pp. 32‚Äì35 According to Smith, the actual identity of the party is unclear. Kondo's testimonies stated that the organization called itself the \\"Communist Party\\" but Takase's testimonies give a slightly different view. According to Takase, the name of the organization was \\"Gy≈çmin Communist Group\\" and was more of an informal association than a structured party. However, the leaflets distributed by the organization were signed \\"Communist Party Headquarters\\".Smith, Henry DeWitt. Japan's First Student Radicals. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1972. p. 97 Propaganda work Less than a month after the founding meeting, the party began to distribute propaganda in Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe and Kyoto. In early October 1921, the party began distributing propaganda posters. In November, the party circulated two sets of anti-militarist/anti-war leaflets to soldiers, who had gathered in the Tokyo area for a large-scale military exercise. International links The party sought to establish links with the Communist International. Before founding the party, Kondo had the ambition to attend the third congress of the Comintern himself (held in the summer of 1921). Soon after the founding of the party a Waseda University student, Shigeta Yoshi, was sent to Shanghai with a number of documents of the party. On November 25, 1921, Shigeta returned to Japan, accompanied by a European Comintern representative. Moreover, the party was contacted by a Comintern representative visiting Japan with the request to send a delegate to the Congress of the Peoples of the Far East. The party decided to send Takase, head of the Publications Committee. Takase was one of four persons representing Japan at the congress.Beckmann, George M., and Genji Okubo. The Japanese Communist Party 1922‚Äì1945. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press, 1969. pp. 39‚Äì40 Repression The propaganda of the party caught the attention of police forces at an early stage. On October 12, 1921, the first wave of arrests of party activists took place. After the anti- militarist action in Tokyo in November, the state cracked down on the party. On November 25, 1921, Kondo, Shigeta and the Comintern representative \\"B. Grey\\" were arrested. Within a week 40 party activists were arrested. These arrests marked the end of the existence of the party. B. Grey was expelled from Japan, and the funds he had taken with him were confiscated.

Jean Baptiste Pierre Constant de Suzannet, Count de Suzannet (13 February 1772 - 21 June 1815) was a Roman Catholic royalist officer who fought in the War in the Vend√©e.  Early life  He was born in the master bedroom of the family manor house, the Ch√¢teau la Chardi√®re, in the French locality of Chavagnes-en- Paillers. His family had been residing there for generations and a descendant now owns the house. During his early years, he developed a liking for traditional country pursuits, such as riding and hunting. Coat of Arms of the de Suzannet family  Military career  Because of the tremendous political and social instability caused by the French Revolution, Suzannet emigrated to Britain in 1792, but he returned to France in 1795, following the landing at Quiberon, to fight for God and country. When he arrived, he was placed under the command of Fran√ßois de Charette. Charette was captured and executed in 1796, Suzannet succeeded as head of the Army of Lower Poitou during the insurrection of 1799. Napoleon Bonaparte's return to Paris from exile on the Isle of Elba in 1815 caused a change of government that the people from the Vend√©e were reluctant to accept. The vast majority of the people in the area -including Suzannet himself- were deeply royalist.

The presentation of materials (\\"slide selector\\") was called an electronic book. The store of information in the system was called an electronic blackboard. PLATO had a sophisticated help system, whereby different types of wrong answers resulted in the student being sent different help sequences. A rudimentary spell checker was included in the system. A comment page allowed the student to comment on the lessons at any time. An instructor page allowed the instructor to communicate with the student. A \\"perfect workbook\\" recorded student responses to questions, as well as kept a record of each button the student pushed and the time at which he or she pushed it.

It consisted of an arithmetic drill program that \\"automatically adjusted its level of difficulty as a function of the student's rate of success\\". 1968 * Telesecundaria a system based on satellite TV for secondary students in rural areas, was set up by the Mexican Government. Initially, over 6,500 students were served in 304 classrooms, each one equipped with a satellite dish and a black-and-white TV set. The system is still in use, but now reaches over a million students in 16,000 rural facilities in Mexico and several Central American countries. * An IBM 1500 system was installed at the University of Alberta, where on-line courses included cardiology training for the University's medical school. This system was finally taken out of service on April 10, 1980, after twelve years of operation. Over 20,000 people had used the system in that interval, and programming was available for 17 university courses. The instructional operating system of the IBM 1500 had a registration system, bookmarking, authoring, and progress reports all built-in. * Alan Kay, a graduate student at the University of UTAH, proposes the FLEX language.

The idea of going \\"solo\\" was that the student was in charge of his or her own learning. However, the limitations of the approach were also recognized, and the group ended up proposing a \\"Community of Learning\\" model in 1976.Dwyer, Thomas (1976) The fundamental problem of computer-enhanced education and some ideas about a solution.

Ballard. The Mitre Ticcit Project conducted at the University of Texas, later moved to Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, and its sister project called the PLATO Project, was conducted at the University of Illinois, Champaign. Over 140 natural language dialog programs were created between 1970 and 1978. UCI's Physics Computer Development Project conducted approximately 55 educational programs and spearheaded development throughout the UC system. Initial projects were conducted on Teletype model 33, paper tape punch machine that operated at a 110 baud rate. 1971 * The MITRE Corporation begins a year-long demonstration of the TICCIT system among Reston, Virginia cable television subscribers. Interactive television services included informational and educational demonstrations using a touch-tone telephone. The National Science Foundation refunds the PLATO project and funds MITRE's proposal to modify its TICCIT technology as a computer-assisted instruction (CAI) system to support English and algebra at community colleges. MITRE subcontracts instructional design and courseware authoring tasks to the University of Texas at Austin and Brigham Young University. * Project EXTEND was set up in Michigan as a \\"small college consulting service for instructional computing.\\"Zinn, Karl (1972) Programming support and faculty development: A view from an instructional computing consulting service.

Deschooling Society. New York, Harper & Row Among the features of his proposed system are ** Reference Services to Educational Objects ‚Äî which facilitate access to things or processes used for formal learning. ** Skill Exchanges ‚Äî which permit persons to list their skills, the conditions under which they are willing to serve as models for others who want to learn these skills, and the addresses at which they can be reached. ** Peer-Matching ‚Äî a communications network which permits persons to describe the learning activity in which they wish to engage, in the hope of finding a partner for the inquiry. ** Reference Services to Educators-at-Large ‚Äî who can be listed in a directory giving the addresses and self-descriptions of professionals, paraprofessionals, and free-lancers, along with conditions of access to their services. 1972 * Patrick Suppes, professor at Stanford University, developed computer-based courses in Logic and Set Theory that were offered to Stanford undergraduates from 1972 to 1992. * The Learning Research Group is formed at Xerox PARC in Palo Alto, California. It is led by Alan Kay, who advanced the idea of a graphical user interface (GUI) by inventing icons for folders, menus, and overlapping windows. Kay and his group envisioned a computer for teaching and learning that they called the \\"KiddiKomputer\\", to be programmed using the Smalltalk language they had developed. While Kay could see many educational uses for this computer, he had four initial projects in mind: 1) Teaching thinking skills, 2) Teaching modeling through the simulation of systems, 3) Teaching interface skills, and 4) Tracking what children would do with the computer outside school hours, when left to their own devices. Second level projects for teaching children with a computer included 1) Computer evaluation, 2) Iconic programming, especially for children under 8. Kay and his colleagues started teaching programming to children and adults in 1973. * First Canadian Symposium on Instructional Technology held in Calgary, Alberta. 1973 * The National Development Program in Computer Assisted Learning was set up in the UK in January, 1973.Cooper, Aldwyn (1980) Past historic, present imperfect, future conditional. In Swail, E. and Neal, G. (Eds.) Proceedings of the Third Canadian Symposium on Instructional Technology, Vancouver, February 27, 1980, Ottawa: National Research Council Canada. * A report written for the University of Michigan described the educational uses of computers at the university. These included \\"drill, skills practice, programmed and dialog tutorials, testing and diagnosis, simulation, gaming, information processing, computation, problem solving, model construction, graphic display, the management of instructional resources, and the presentation and display of materials.\\"Zinn, Karl (1973) Contributions of Computing to College Teaching and Learning Activities at the University of Michigan.

These included all student academic and personal data, all faculty data that dealt with courses and teaching, all course data in regards to student, faculty and class meeting times and days, enrollments, buildings, and the college calendar and catalog. There was also \\"an interaction course management system\\".Yost, Michael (1973) Extracting Data from Integrated Student Information Systems. ERIC Document ED244563. * As a post-doc at Carnegie-Mellon University, Jay Warner needed to teach undergraduate metallurgy students how to use new software that would calculate phase diagrams (graphical representations of metal states/phases as a function of composition and temperature) based on thermodynamic properties. He wrote a CAI (Computer-Assisted Instruction) module that, however crudely, used some of the principles discussed in this article. A frame, or paragraph of information, was presented, and the machine branched to different follow-up frames and questions depending on the response to the embedded questions. The whole thing was written in FORTRAN IV. It proved useful; students could then use the software without close attendance by the instructor. This work was in no way as dramatic as the other accomplishments of the day, however it does show that by this time CAL was not restricted to studies of learning methods. 1974 * Murray Turoff founded the Computerized Conferencing and Communications Center at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) and over the next 15 years conducts an immense amount of research on Computer-mediated communication (CMC) with Starr Roxanne Hiltz. Much of this is on its applicability to the \\"Virtual Classroom\\", including field trials in the 1980s. The specifications for EIES 2 are particularly seminal ‚Äì note in particular the material on roles, resources and hypertext. * Launched in June 1974, Creative Computing was the first computer magazine for general readers and hobbyists. The Jan‚ÄìFeb 1976 issue had an article on \\"Learning with Computer Games\\". * An \\"international school\\" was held in a remote Italian resort to explore the state of the art of computer-assisted instruction (CAI). Direct connections with computers in Italy and the United States made it possible to demonstrate a variety of existing CAI systems. Papers describing the use of CAI in five sets of educational institutions were presented.Zinn, Karl et al. (Eds.) (1974) Computers in the Instructional Process: report of an international school. University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Center for Research on Learning and Teaching, 550p. ERIC Document ED100327. 1975 * The NSF- funded TICCIT Project begins testing English and algebra courseware at Northern Virginia Community College in Alexandria, Virginia, and at Phoenix College, part of the Maricopa County Community College District system in Phoenix, Arizona. The modified TICCIT system supports 128 student terminals made of modified television sets providing text and graphics in seven colors, digital audio, and a video switching device to embed video into the computer generated instruction. A specialized keyboard allows students to control their own progress through the courseware, which includes both tutorials, drills, and testing.Writing Lab Newsletter, 2(7), March, 1978 What is interesting about TICCIT is that it was based on a learner controlled command language that allowed the user to manipulate his or her own sequencing and development of learning strategies.Bunderson, C. Victor (1973) Learner-Controlled Course on the TICCIT System. ACM Conference Proceedings, available online at Association for Computing Machinery * COMIT was a sophisticated system of computer-assisted instruction developed jointly by IBM and the University of Waterloo in Canada. It emphasized unique audiovisual capabilities of the television set and light pens. The project ran until 1978.Beem, P., Knapper, C.K., and Elkeer, E. (1980) Three Views of COMIT.

Creative Computing, 7(4), April 1981, pp. 98‚Äì102. 1976 * Edutech Project of Encinitas California (now Digital ChoreoGraphics of Newport Beach, CA) develops DOTTIE, a TV Set-Top device linking the home TV to online services such as CompuServ and The Source via a common household telephone. * Development of the language Pop11 (derived from the Edinburgh AI language Pop2) and its teaching tools starts at the University of Sussex. This later evolved into Poplog. * Development of the KOM computer conferencing system begins at Stockholm University. See Jacob Palme's history of KOM * First experimental developments at the Open University of what became the Cyclops system ‚Äì then called a telewriting or audio-graphic system but nowadays would be called a whiteboard system ‚Äì under two separate teams in the Faculties of Mathematics (Read and Bacsich) and Technology (Pinches and Liddell) ‚Äì the first team focusing on storage on cassette tape of digital data to drive VDUs, the second focusing on transmission of handwriting over telephone lines. There were similar developments under way in the US and France. * Coastline Community College, having no physical campus, became the first Virtual College in the United States. * Second Canadian Symposium on Instructional Technology held in Quebec City, Quebec. * Open University in the UK sets up the CICERO project with three courses taught online.Cooper, Aldwyn (1980) Computer-based Learning at the Open University and the CICERO system.

ERIC document ED125578. 1977 * With the Canadian federal Department of Communications, TVOntario (TVO) pioneered the use of satellites for educational teleconferencing and direct-to-home transmission through the Hermes project. The experiment allowed students in California and Toronto to interact via electronic classrooms.Communication technology and development; Reports and papers on mass communication; Vol.:101; 1988 * The Communications Research Center of the Canadian federal government's Department of Communications developed Telidon, a second generation videotext system that was used in field trials in several educational settings. * Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) provides Computer- Aided Instruction (CAI) tutorials for its BASIC programming language on DEC PDP computers. * At the UK Open University, the software and hardware teams developing telewriting systems merged to form the Cyclops project and gained funding, initially internally, later from UK government sources. There is little trace of Cyclops now on the Open University web site. 1978 * Pathlore (as part of Legent Corp.) started developing CBT solutions. In 1995 it became divested from Legent. Its PHOENIX software delivered \\"virtual classrooms\\" to many corporate networks. Pathlore was acquired by SumTotal Systems in 2005. *The National Science Foundation releases its evaluation of the MITRE TICCIT project demonstration, giving a mixed review of the success of using the computer-television system as the primary source of instruction for English and algebra. *The Defense Research Institute in Sweden released the KOM computer conferencing system which (at its peak) had a thousand users 1979 * Prestel, claimed by BT as \\"the world's first public viewdata service\\", was opened in London in September, running on a cluster of minicomputers. It had been conceived in the early 1970s by Samuel Fedida of the Post Office Research Laboratories at Dollis Hill, London. Similar developments were under way in France (Teletel) and Canada (Telidon). Only those active at the time will remember the sense of euphoria and opening of possibilities in what would now be called the e-business and e-learning worlds. (Sadly, the concept was premature, although in France it had most success.) A number of mainframe, minicomputer and even micro-computer based systems and services were later developed in educational circles of which perhaps the best known were OPTEL, Communitel, ECCTIS and NERIS. * In Canada, groups including TVOntario, Athabasca University, the University of Victoria, and the University of Waterloo participated in Telidon experiments during the late 70s and early 80s. Telidon, an alphageometric videotex information system used set-top boxes with TV sets, or subsequently software decoders running on PCs (Apple II, MAC, and PC decoders were available) to display text and graphics. The intent was to demonstrate and develop educational applications for videotex and teletext systems. This work continued until 1983, when the Telidon coding structure became a North American standard ‚Äì ANSI T500 ‚Äì NAPLPS (North American Presentation Layer Protocol Syntax). * The Athabasca University educational Telidon project used a Unix path structure which allowed the storage of information pages in the file system tree. This is now the universal storage method for pages on the internet. As described, the system had the ability to create separate user groups with different access privileges, and to implement \\"action scripts\\" to access system functions, including email and dynamic content generation. The AU system was described in Abell, R.A. \\"Implementation of a Telidon System Using UNIX File Structures\\" in Godfrey, D. and Chang, E. (eds) The Telidon Book, Reston Publishing Company, Reston, VA, 1981) * An article by Karl L. Zinn in Educational Technology describes the uses of microcomputers at the University of Michigan. Uses included \\"word processing, extending laboratory experience, simulation, games, tutorial uses, and building skills in computing.\\"Zinn, Karl (1979) Using the Microcomputer: one university's experiences. Educational Technology, 91(11), Nov., 55‚Äì55. 1980s 1980 * Successmaker is a K‚Äì12 learning management system with an emphasis on reading, spelling and numeracy. According to the Pearson Digital Learning website, the South Colonie Central School District in Albany, New York \\"has been using SuccessMaker since 1980, and in 1997 the district upgraded the software to SuccessMaker version 5.5.\\" * The Open University begins a pilot trial of a viewdata (videotex) system OPTEL, on a DEC-20 mainframe. This had been conceived by Peter Zorkoczy even before the launch of the national Prestel system in 1979 and was locally specified and coded (in COBOL) by Peter Frogbrook (RIP) and Gyan Mathur. One of the main motivations was its applicability to online learning. It was available via dial-up from home, and later in the 1980s via telnet(!) on the X.25 and internet networks. There were individual user codes and passwords, giving different access rights; the one generic access code was regularly attacked by hackers even in these far-off days, as URLs still on the web attest. The system is overviewed in Delivery Mechanisms for CAL\\", CAL Research Group Technical Report No. 11. * Seymour Papert at MIT publishes \\"Mindstorms: children, computers, and powerful ideas\\". (New York: Basic Books). This book inspired a number of books and dissertations on \\"microworlds\\" and their impact on learning. * The idea of managing teaching resources using a computer is described in a paper by J.M. Leclerc and S. Normand from the University of Montreal. Their system was programmed in BASIC, and used a computer to track documents, human resources, structured activities, and places for training and observation. Evaluation activities were also available in the system.Leclerc, J.M. and Normand, S. (1980) A general management system for university teaching resources. In Swail, E. and Neal, G. (Eds.) Proceedings of the Third Canadian Symposium on Instructional Technology, Vancouver, February 27, 1980, Ottawa: National Research Council Canada. * The University of Montreal offered CAF√â, a computer system that taught written French. Graduated groups of questions were generated according to individual indicators. Students went through the system at their own pace.Dupriez, B., Connolly, G., and Normand, S. (1980) Computer generation of exercise books and individualized progress plans for the CAF√â course. In Swail, E. and Neal, G. (Eds.) Proceedings of the Third Canadian Symposium on Instructional Technology, Vancouver, February 27, 1980, Ottawa: National Research Council Canada. * TLM (The Learning Manager) was released in 1980 and included distinct roles for students, instructors, educational assistants, and administrators. The system could be accessed remotely by dial-up as a student or an instructor using a terminal emulator. The system had a sophisticated test bank capability and generated tests and practice activities based on a learning objective data structure. Instructors and students could communicate through the terminal. Instructors could lock out students or post messages. Originally called LMS (Learning Management System), TLM was used extensively at SAIT (Southern Alberta Institute of Technology) and Bow Valley College, both located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. 1981 * School of Management and Strategic Studies at the Western Behavioral Sciences Institute in La Jolla, California starts an online program. * University of Sussex, UK, implements Poplog, an interactive learning environment for AI and computing students. It includes hyperlinked teaching materials, an extensible text editor, multiple programming languages and interactive demonstrations of AI programs. Cyclops telewriting system, tutor's station * Field trials begin of the Cyclops whiteboard system in the East Midlands Region of the Open University and run for two years. The evaluation was funded by a grant from British Telecom and allowed the evaluation Director Tony Bates to employ Mike Sharples and David McConnell as research fellows. Audio-visual material for Cyclops was produced on the Cyclops Studio , a multimedia editing system coded in UCSD Pascal by a software team led by Paul Bacsich and including Mark Woodman. Cyclops was later awarded a BCS prize for innovation and systems installed in Indonesia. There are only passing references now to Cyclops on the open Web (see under names cited) ‚Äì the best source of specifications and chronology is the article \\"Cyclops:shared-screen teleconferencing\\" in The Role of Technology in Distance Education, edited Tony Bates, Croom Helm, 1984.Bates, Tony & Helm, Croom, eds. (1984). The Role of Technology in Distance Education. Retrieved on 2006-08-15. * Over this period the Open University was also developing its own viewdata (videotex) system, called OPTEL, for use in education. This had in fact started about the same time as Cyclops in yet another team at the OU. The project ran until about 1985 when it faded away, as did videotex generally across the world (except the Minitel in France). In addition to OPTEL, several other systems were implemented including VOS (Videotex Operating System) which allowed the display and manipulation of text files via videotex. VOS was further developed into a telesoftware, transactional (gateway) and email system and then used in a commercial development for IMS, the media research company (using a very early precursor of Web/CGI development). These were coded in Pascal and COBOL on the DEC-20 mainframe. Some of the ideas of OPTEL were taken over into the ECCTIS project delivering course data via viewdata from a Unisys mainframe ‚Äì indeed one of the former OPTEL staff joined ECCTIS as Director. Systems were also specified to deliver Computer-Assisted Learning ‚Äì see in particular the article \\"Viewdata systems\\" in The Role of Technology in Distance Education. There are only fragmentary references now to OPTEL on the open Web. * Allen Communication in Salt Lake City, Utah, introduced the first commercial interactive videodisc. * BITNET, founded by a consortium of US and Canadian universities, allowed universities to connect with each other for educational communications and e-mail. At its peak in 1991, it had over 500 organizations as members and over 3000 nodes. Its use declined as the World Wide Web grew. * Alfred Bork wrote an article entitled Information Retrieval in Education, in which he identified the ways \\"computer-based techniques can be used for course management, direct learning, and research.\\"Bork, Alfred (1981) Information Retrieval in Education, Technological Horizons in Education, 8(2), Feb 49‚Äì51. 1982 * The Computer Assisted Learning Center (CALC) founded as a small, offline computer- based, adult learning center.

The system was used by Pepperdine University, Georgia Tech, San Diego County Department of Education, and Alaska Department of Education for distance learning. * CET (later NCET and now Becta) publishes Videotex in Education: A new technology briefing, a 54-page booklet written by Vincent Thompson, Mike Brown and Chris Knowles. This is out of print and few copies are now available. () * Hermann Maurer invents MUPID, an innovative videotex device later used widely in Austria. This starts a strand of development leading on to Hyper-G and a range of other developments. See also the of Hyper-G. * Carnegie Mellon University and IBM create the Information Technology Center which begins the Andrew Project at Carnegie Mellon. One of the primary goals of the project is to provide a platform for \\"computer-aided instruction\\" using a distributed workstation computing environment, authenticated access to both personal and public file spaces in a distributed file system (AFS), authoring tools for computer-based lessons, and collaboration tools including bulletin boards and electronic messaging. * Peter Smith of the UK Open University completes his PhD thesis (157 pp) on \\"Radiotext: an application of computer and communication systems in distance teaching\\". (Only one reference online.) It is believed that the work started in the late 1970s under the supervision of Peter Zorkcoczy, who also conceived the OPTEL viewdata system. Radiotext denoted the transmission of data over radio signals, just as it can be sent over telephone lines. It may seem normal now, as in the Radio Data System (RDS) in these days of digital radio, but in the 1970s the concept was novel and complex for their colleagues to grasp. 1983 * McConnell, D. and Sharples, M.

One PC acts as a server for files in the network. * The OECD organized a conference in Paris, France, on \\"Education and the New Information Technology.\\" * Antic (magazine) publishes a review of a cartridge for Atari home computers allowing Atari users to access courseware on the CDC PLATO system via modem. * Computer Teaching Corporation (CTC) launched TenCORE which was the leading authoring language in the late 1980s. It was MS-DOS based. CTC also produced a network-based Computer Managed Instruction System which allowed users to take on the roles of author, student and administrator and to create and participate in a plurality of courses. * The Intercultural Learning Network created at UC, San Diego linked schools in Japan, Israel, Mexico, and California and Alaska in the U.S. in the first online Learning Circle. This effort was funded by an Apple \\"wheels for the MInd\\" grant. * ComSubLant adopts an elearning program for use on all U.S. submarines to train crewmen at sea. It was developed by FTG1 Doner Caldwell at Submarine Group Six and ran on the Tektronix 4052A computer. The program utilized a lesson / test bank covering all submarine sonar publications on large format tape cartridge. 1985 * In 1985, the Graduate School of Computer and Information Sciences, at Nova Southeastern University, pioneers accredited graduate degrees through online courses, awarding their first doctorate. * In 1985, Patrick Suppes, professor at Stanford University, received a grant from the National Science Foundation to develop a first-year calculus course on computer. After several years of development and testing in summer camps, computer-based courses in Beginning Algebra, Intermediate Algebra, and Precalculus were created and tested during the 1991‚Äì92 academic year. In Fall 1992, after porting the software to the Windows operating system, the Education Program for Gifted Youth (EPGY) was formally launched at Stanford University, making these courses available to qualified students. * Project Athena at MIT, on the potential uses of advanced computer technology in the university curriculum, has been underway for two years by this time, and about 60 educational development projects are in progress.Computing in higher education: the Athena experience. Communications of the ACM, Volume 28 , Issue 11 (November 1985) Special issue: computing in the frontiers of science and engineering. Pages: 1214‚Äì1224 * The SuperBook Project started at Bell Communications Research, Morristown, USA. The purpose of the project was to find new ways of navigating online books.Landauer, T., Egan, D., Remde, J., Lesk, M., Lochbaum, C. and Ketchum, D.

(It took two more years for all details to be finalised.) See the history of ASCILITE. ASCILITE is the co-publisher of the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET). 1986 * Tony Bates publishes \\"Computer Assisted Learning or Communications: Which Way for Information Technology in Distance Education?\\", Journal of Distance Education/ Revue de l'enseignement a distance, reflecting (in 1986!) on ways forward for e-learning, based on 15 years of operational use of computer networks at the Open University and nine years of systematic R&D; on CAL, viewdata/videotex, audio-graphic teleconferencing and computer conferencing. Many of the systems specification issues discussed later are rehearsed here. * Edward Barrett comes to MIT in the Program in Writing and Humanistic Studies. He becomes co- director of a group working on a distance learning project called the \\"Networked Educational Online System\\" (NEOS), a suite of programs for teaching writing and other subjects in specially designed electronic seminar rooms. * First version of LISTSERV is written by Eric Thomas, an engineering student in Paris, France. It was first used in the BITNET network for electronic mailing lists among universities. * Fifth Canadian Symposium on Instructional Technology held May 5‚Äì7 in Ottawa. * First version of CSILE installed on a small network of Cemcorp ICON computers at an elementary school in Toronto, Canada. CSILE included text and graphical notes authored by several kinds of users (students, teachers, others) with attributes such as comments and thinking types which reflect the role of the note in the author's thinking. Thinking types included \\"my theory\\", \\"new information\\", and \\"I need to understand\\". CSILE later evolved into Knowledge Forum. * Intersystem Concepts, Inc., founded by Steven Okonski and Gary Dickelman, introduces the Summit Authoring System which includes student tracking and bookmarks plus instructor course management features. It is the first to bring streaming media to a virtual learning environment. *Research Report 24, September 1986, published from the Computerized Conferencing and Communications Center, New Jersey Institute of Technology: 'The Virtual Classroom: Building the Foundations' Starr Roxanne Hiltz, Project Director, Research Report for the 1985-86 Academic Year, \\"Tools for the Enhancement and evaluation of a Virtual Classroom' includes chapters on research, software development, implementation issues, evaluation methods, student participation and outcomes, with brief descriptions of online courses offered at NJIT, Upsala College and The New School for Social Research. 1987 * In 1987, NKI Distance Education in Norway starts its first online distance education courses. The courses were provided through EKKO, NKI's self-developed Learning Management System(LMS). The experiences are described in the article NKI Fjernundervisning: Two Decades of Online Sustainability in Morten Flate Paulsen's book Online Education and Learning Management Systems which is available from the author via Campus NooA * From this year until 1991 several UK groups of researchers associated in one way or another with the Open University, the UK Department for Industry (especially the Alvey programme, the transputer team and the Information Technology Consultancy Unit) and the emerging European Commission DELTA programme, carry out a mass of specification and prototyping work on \\"educational environments\\". Projects include the Thought Box; the Learning Systems Reference Model; Portable Educational Tools Environment (joint OU, Harlequin and Chorus Syst√®mes); and Transputer-Based Communications-oriented Learning System. Among the non-OU co-workers were Chris Webb, Bill Olivier and Oleg Liber, all still active in e-learning. (No useful material left on the current public Web.) * Authorware Inc. is formed in Minneapolis/St. Paul. From initial prototypes developed on both mainframe and very early personal computers, a Macintosh-based authoring system called \\"Course of Action\\" is introduced; later a PC version is developed. Shortly after its introduction, the title of the authoring system is changed to match the name of the company. Authorware went on to become the first and most widely used industry-standard development tool. * The Athena Writing Project at MIT publishes \\"Electronic Classroom: Specification for a user interface\\"E. Barrett, F. Bequaert, J. Paradis, \\"Electronic Classroom: Specification for a user interface\\", Athena Writing Project, Boston, MA, (4 June 1987) * 1987, Glenn Jones of Jones Intercable in Denver, Colorado believed he saw a potential goldmine when he created a new system, called Mind Extension University in 1987. Jones created a system where telecourses could be provided across a network to various colleges and at the same time, students could interact with the instructors and each other, by using email, sent over the internet. Jones then began to beam the courses by satellite, so anyone with a satellite dish could watch the classes and if they had a computer and a phone line they could interact with the class. * A group of companies in Alberta, working with Alberta Government Telephones, create a pre-internet \\"whiteboard-like\\" audiographic teleconferencing system. Using PCs, specialized NAPLPS-based software, and audioconferencing bridges, the system shares graphics, text, and voice, for synchronous multipoint instructor/student student/student communication. The system was used by the Commonwealth of Learning in several locations around the globe, and was also used by Arctic College in Alaska for distance education. In some implementations, the students uploaded assignments to instructors for marking. 1988 * Probably the first large-scale use of computer conferencing in distance teaching when the Open University UK launched DT200 Introduction to Information Technology with 1000 students per year. The ur-evaluation by Robin Mason is a good description ‚Äì see Chapter 9 of Mindweave ‚Äì Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul * Edward Barrett and James Paradis publish a chapter entitled \\"The Online Environment and In-House Training\\" in Edward Barrett (Ed.) Text, ConText, and HyperText (1988-MIT Press), that describes Project Athena as an Educational On-Line System (EOS). * Question Mark (see QuestionMark) introduces a DOS-based Assessment Management System. A Windows-based version was introduced in 1993, and an internet version was introduced in 1995. See Questionmark's website. *Utilizing colleague Stephen Wolfram's Mathematica computer algebra system, mathematics professors at the University of Illinois, Jerry Uhl and Horacio Porta along with Professor Bill Davis of The Ohio State University, develop Calculus&Mathematica; and offer calculus courses at UIUC and OSU in computer labs. * Peter Copen launches the New York State/Moscow Schools Telecommunications Project, linking 12 schools in New York State with 12 in Moscow in the former Soviet Union to demonstrate that students can learn better through direct interaction online and will become global citizens. This was the pilot project for what later became iEARN (International Education and Resource Network). 1989 * Tim Berners-Lee, then a young British engineer working at CERN in Switzerland, circulated a proposal for an in-house online document sharing system which he described as a \\"web of notes with links\\". After the proposal was grudgingly approved by his superiors, he called the new system the World Wide Web. * Chris Moore, Chief Technology Officer at THINQ Learning Solutions for many years, pioneered the TrainingServer learning management system for Syscom, Inc. Syscom was acquired by THINQ in 2000. THINQ was by Saba in 2005. Chris Moore has recently founded Zeroed-In Technologies. * Lancaster University (UK) launches the MSc in Information Technology and Learning: now the world's longest continually running Masters programme taught using virtual learning methods (see Goodyear, P (2005) The emergence of a networked learning community: lessons learned from research and practice, in Kearsley, G. (ed) Online learning, Englewood Cliffs NJ: Educational Technology Publications, 113‚Äì127.) *The Calculus&Mathematica; support team at the University of Illinois begin offering computerized calculus courses utilizing Mathematica over the internet to High School students in rural Illinois. * John S. Quarterman published a 700+ page book, \\"The Matrix: Computer Networks and Conferencing Systems Worldwide\\" (Digital Press, 1989). This book provided detailed addressing protocols on how different computer networks could connect with each other for the purpose of exchanging information and holding discussions, and network maps of the developing Internet. * Networked Educational Online System (NEOS) developed and deployed at MIT. The system provided coursework exchange between different roles allowing for grading, annotating, and public discussions.

Release 1.0 includes functionality which is \\"revolutionary\\" for the time, including allowing system/server administrators to create a user mailbox, user records in a Name and Address database, and to notarize the user's ID file through dialog boxes. Also includes an electronic mail system with return receipt and notification features, and on-line help, \\"a feature not offered in many products at this time.\\" Official history of Lotus Notes * Publication of the book Mindweave: Communication, Computers and Distance Education, edited by Robin Mason and Anthony Kaye (published by Pergamon Press, Oxford, 273p). This was a hugely influential book on computer conferencing on which many of the leading experts of the time collaborated. In addition to descriptions of applications, there were several chapters describing or specifying systems, in particular the Thought Box. The book is available second-hand (e.g. via Amazon) but the full text (no images) is on the web. * The first public article specifying the Thought Box appears as Chapter 7 of Mindweave, written by Gary Alexander and Ches Lincoln. It is entitled \\"The thought box: A computer-based communication system to support distance learning\\". Although the specification is couched in terms of a hardware device linked to a remote mail/resources server the article also describes the prototype work being done in HyperCard, and it could be argued that this software prototype had many of the features of a modern Personal Learning Environment. In fact, over the next few years, the HyperCard route was the way by which the ideas were advanced, eventually appearing in the XT001 online course in the early 1990s and in several other Open University courses. * The Athena Writing Project at MIT produces this publication: N. Hagan Heller, \\"Designing a User Interface for the Educational On-line System\\", Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, MA, May 1989. * Education 2010 is published. This 83-page booklet (published by Newman Software, ) arose out of an invitational conference at Bangor in July, 1989, with a brief to examine the possible role of IT in Education in the year 2010. With a few notable exceptions such as Stephen Heppell, few of the conference delegates are active now in e-learning ‚Äì but it makes interesting reading. * ECCTIS Limited was formed when it successfully completed in a closed tendering exercise for the ECCTIS online (viewdata) courses information service earlier run by the UK Open University. \\"ECCTIS\\" is one of the few names from the viewdata era of the 1980s to carry on till this day, even if somewhat changed. ECCTIS has a useful history page. * Dr. John Sperling and Terri Hedegaard Bishop begin the University of Phoenix Online campus, based in San Francisco, California. It was the first private university venture to deliver complete academic degree programs (Master's and bachelor's degrees) and services to a mass audience, via asynchronous online technologies. This early success is later documented in a paper written by Hedegaard-Bishop and Howard Garten (Professor at University of Dayton, Dayton, Ohio), \\"The Rise of Computer Conferencing Courses and Online Education: Challenges for Accreditation and Assessment\\" and published in a collection of Papers on Self-Study and Institutional Improvement by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, (1993) 137‚Äì145. * F.C. Prasse and B.T. Hackett present at the 1989 Technology and Innovations in Training and Education (TITE) Conference on an operational distance education prototype fielded in 1987 using off-the-shelf RBBS software and featuring messaging, current issues, a multi-topic asynchronous threaded discussion format, as well as a searchable online reference database.

Atlanta, GA: American Defense Preparedness Association. 1990s 1991 * In datacloudDatacloud: Toward a New Theory of Online Work, Johndan Johnson-Eilola describes a specific computer-supported collaboriation space: The Smart Board, which was introduced in 1991. According to Johnson- Eilola, a ‚ÄúSmart Board system provides a 72-inch, rear projection, touchscreen, intelligent whiteboard surface for work‚Äù (79). In datacloudDatacloud, Johnson-Eilola asserts that ‚Äú[w]e are attempting to understand how users move within information spaces, how users can exist within information spaces rather than merely gaze at them, and how information spaces must be shared with others rather than being private, lived within rather than simply visited‚Äù (82). He explains how the Smart Board system offers an information space that allows his students to engage in active collaboration. He makes three distinct claims regarding the functionality of the technology: 1) The Smart Board allows users to work with large amounts of information, 2) It offers an information space that invites active collaboration, 3) The work produced is often ‚Äúdynamic and contingent‚Äù (82).Johnson-Eilola, Johndan. Datacloud: Toward a New Theory of Online Work. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press, Inc., 2005. Print. * Johnson-Eilola further explains that with the Smart Board ‚Äú‚Ä¶information work becom[es] a bodied experience‚Äù (81). Users have the opportunity to engage with‚Äîinhabit‚Äîthe technology by direct manipulation. Moreover, this space allows for more than one user; essentially, it invites multiple users. 1992 * Gyrus Systems, led by owners Robert Dust and Robert Minteer, launch Training Administrator to automate course and schedules, training budgets, resource management, reporting, and mapping training to job function. Training Administrator was one of the first HR products designed for Microsoft Windows. Upon initiation, Training Administrator was used throughout the United States and in 17 other countries. * Convene International is co-founded by Mr. Jeffrey Stein, Mr. Reda Athanasios and Mr. Jeff Kuhn. Convene provided a communication services via the Internet for affinity groups of different back ground. One of it focused area was providing a distance education solutions for churches and seminaries. 1993 * Convene International collaborates with the University of Phoenix to provide the first full collaborative distance education online model. Mr. Reda Athanasios leads the technological efforts. Mr. Tom Bishop of UOP Online establishes the UOP marketing efforts. 1994 * TeleEducation NB, a provincial distance learning network in the Canadian province of New Brunswick implemented a primitive DOS-based learning management system designed by Rory McGreal. * Convene International start offering its completed Internet online education service to all schools that wished to embark on online distance education. 1995 * Arnold Pizer and Michael Gage at the University of Rochester Department of Mathematics develop WeBWorK (a free Perl-based system for delivering individualized homework problems over the web) for use in mathematics instruction. * In 1995 a group at Oregon State University (Bill Bogley, Robby Robson, John Sechrest, John Dorbolo and others) developed InterQuest (a database-driven system that added quizzing, grading, and other functionality to web pages) and CalculusQuest, an online calculus course.Bogley, W.

It was the first course taught at a distance using the web. *The first fully online, for- credit university course was developed in 1994-95, and taught in the Fall 1995 at the University of Waterloo by Professor Paul Beam. It was English 210e (Technical Writing). The technology for the course was built by Jeremy Auger, who later went on to become a co-founder of Desire2Learn (D2L), the learning platform company. * Neville Gordon-Carroll and Vaughn Taylor at Microsoft launched MOLI - Microsoft Online Institute - an online learning proof of concept built as a result of an intensive research project into the future of technology based learning. The desired outcome was a platform for self- directed learning at any time, from anywhere with content that was dynamically updated and immediately relevant. MOLI was initially developed by Microsoft on the MSN proprietary platform then rapidly migrated to the internet as Microsoft embraced the internet in mid 1995. Microsoft Online Institute was a simple hosted learning platform that was made available to private and public learning institutions to conduct and experiment with their own classrooms, content and instruction model. During this time Microsoft actively evangelized internet based learning to higher education institutions, learning content developers and traditional education companies. Despite initial resistance to this new learning model several companies and institutions used MOLI as an experimental platform before launching their own offerings. 1996 * Jones International University becomes the first accredited fully web based university. * Gyrus Systems launches Training Wizard and Training Wizard Plus.\\"GYRUS BRINGS 'WIZARDRY' TO TRAINING SOFTWARE FIELD.\\" The Free Library. 1996 PR Newswire Association LLC 10 April 2015 The Training Wizard product line was released to cater to smaller organizations, while its previous product, Training Administrator was an enterprise level application. * CourseInfo LLC founded by Dan Cane and Stephen Gilfus at Cornell University. http://www.news.cornell.edu/chronicle/97/10.16.97/Web_company.html Develops the \\"Interactive Learning Network\\" ILN 1.5, and installs it at several academic institutions including Cornell University, Yale Medical School and University of Pittsburgh.

It supports all file types, including multimedia.\\". * In February 1997, Steven Narmontas, introduced a small group of faculty members of Western New England College to a software system he had worked on as a spare time project. Dubbed \\"The Manhattan Project\\", because it was largely developed in secret, the software enabled teachers to post files to a web site for their students to read. The earliest version of \\"Manhattan\\" also supported a few discussion groups and private messaging. Latter it will be the LMS \\"The Manhattan Virtual Classroom\\" * Neal Sample and Mark Arnold present \\"JavaScript for Simulation Education\\" at the NAU/web.97 conference (Flagstaff, Arizona, 12‚Äì15 June 1997).

Biography  Sibthorpe was a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, receiving his M. A. from that institution in 1619. He became vicar of The Holy Sepulchre, Northampton in 1619. He received his D.D. ca. 1626. Sibthorpe first gained national prominence in 1627, when he gave an assize sermon in which he asserted the doctrine of passive obedience. King Charles I wanted to have Sibthorpe's sermon, along with a similar sermon delivered by Roger Maynwaring, printed. George Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury opposed the publication of these sermons, but William Laud, Bishop of Bath and Wells urged George Montaigne, Bishop of London to license the publication and as a result the sermons were published. (Laud was promoted to Bishop of London in 1628 as a result.) At the 1628 Parliament, John Pym moved in the House of Commons of England to impeach Sibthorpe and Maynwaring. In the House of Lords, the two were accused of subverting the commonwealth. As a result, Sibthorpe and Maywaring were imprisoned and fined; suspended from the ministry, prevented from clerical or secular advancement, and told they could not preach at Court. The King was furious at Parliament's actions, and instructed Attorney General Robert Heath to draw up papers giving Sibthorpe and Maynwaring a royal pardon. Charles then made Sibthorpe a chaplain in the Chapel Royal, signaling his intention to defend Sibthorpe against future attacks from Parliament. In 1629, Sibthorpe was appointed rector at Burton Latimer. He later became commissary of the Diocese of Peterborough, and in that capacity he gained a reputation as a zealous represser of Puritanism. With the outbreak of the English Civil War, in 1643 Sibthorpe joined the king at Oxford. His living was sequestrated by the Long Parliament in 1647, but restored in 1660 at the time of the English Restoration.  Legacy  Sibthorpe and Maynwaring remained hated by defenders of English liberty. Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury and John Locke continued to denounce Sibthorpe's opinions decades after his death. Algernon Sidney also spoke out against Sibthorpe and Maynwaring. In the next century, Jonathan Mayhew was continuing to denounce Sibthorpe and Maynwaring.

He is professor of psychological medicine at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London and head of its department of psychological medicine, vice dean for academic psychiatry, teaching and training at the Institute of Psychiatry, as well as Director of the King's Centre for Military Health Research. He is also honorary consultant psychiatrist at King's College Hospital and the Maudsley Hospital, as well as civilian consultant advisor in psychiatry to the British Army. He was knighted in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to military healthcare and to psychological medicine. From 2014 to 2017, he was the elected president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Training After attending King Edward VII School in Sheffield from 1968 to 1975, Wessely studied at Trinity Hall, Cambridge (BA 1978), University College, Oxford (BM BCh 1981), and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (MSc 1989). In 1993 the University of London conferred upon him the degree of Doctor of Medicine. Wessely completed a medical rotation in Newcastle. After attaining medical membership he studied psychiatry (his primary interest) at the Maudsley in 1984. His 1993 doctoral thesis was on the relationship between crime and schizophrenia. Post-doctoral studies included a year at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and a year studying epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. In 1999 he was elected fellow of the UK Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci). Wessely's main research interests lie in the \\"grey areas\\" between medicine and psychiatry, clinical epidemiology and military health. His first paper was entitled \\"Dementia and Mrs. Thatcher\\", since then he has published over 600 papers on subjects including epidemiology, post traumatic stress, medicine and law, history of psychiatry, chronic pain, somatisation, Gulf War syndrome, chemical and biological terrorism and deliberate self-harm. He has published most widely on aspects of chronic fatigue syndrome, including its aetiology, history, psychology, immunology, sociology, epidemiology and treatment. Work on chronic fatigue syndrome In the first years after the introduction of the diagnosis chronic fatigue syndrome the condition was often mocked in the media, for example being described as \\"yuppie flu\\". Wessely and his co-workers verified that this stereotype was inaccurate, substantiating an association between autonomic dysfunction and chronic fatigue syndrome and providing reliable data on the prevalence of CFS in the community, showing that it has become an important public health issue. Other work on CFS included the development of new measurement tools, establishing the lack of relationship between hyperventilation and CFS, discovery of an endocrine \\"signature\\" for CFS that differed from depression and that prior depressive illnesses were likely linked to the condition in some cases. Wessely and his colleagues, using randomised controlled trials and follow-up studies, developed a rehabilitation strategy for patients that involved cognitive behavioural and graded exercise therapy, that is claimed to be effective in reducing symptoms of CFS (a condition that otherwise lacks a cure or unequivocally successful treatment) in ambulant (non-severely affected) patients. Other studies looked at the professional and popular views of CFS, neuropsychological impairment in CFS, and cytokine activation in the illness. Some of his other written work includes a history of CFS, numerous reviews, and co-authoring the 1998 book Chronic fatigue and its syndromes. He has also established the first National Health Service programme solely devoted to patients with CFS, and continues to provide ongoing treatment with patients at King's College Hospital. Wessely believes that CFS generally has some organic trigger, such as a virus, but that the role of psychological and social factors are more important in perpetuating the illness, otherwise known as the 'cognitive behavioural model' of CFS, and that treatments centred around these factors can be effective. He describes the cognitive behavioural model as follows: \\"According to the model the symptoms and disability of CFS are perpetuated predominantly by dysfunctional illness beliefs and coping behaviours. These beliefs and behaviours interact with the patient's emotional and physiological state and interpersonal situation to form self-perpetuating vicious circles of fatigue and disability... The patient is encouraged to think of the illness as 'real but reversible by his or her own efforts' rather than (as many patients do) as a fixed unalterable disease\\". In an interview with the BMJ, Wessely indicated that although viruses and other infections are clearly involved in triggering the onset of CFS, he would not endlessly investigate for infective causes, using the analogy of a hit-and-run accident in which finding out the manufacturer or number plate of the car that hits you doesn't assist the doctor in trying to mend the injury, repeating that we are \\"in the business of rehabilitation\\". Commenting on a now-retracted science paper that stated XMRV virus was found in two-thirds of CFS patients, Wessely said this research fails to model the role that childhood abuse, psychological factors, and other infections may play in the illness. Opposition and criticism In an interview published by The Lancet, Wessely discusses the controversy relating to his work on Gulf War syndrome and chronic fatigue syndrome. With hindsight he states that he was keen to get published, could have been more diplomatic, and is now better at handling controversy. He has been described as both \\"the most hated doctor in Britain\\" and \\"one of the most respected psychiatrists working in Britain today\\". Although Wessely has studied physical markers, and allows the possibility of a biological basis to CFS, he is not confident of such a basis, and remains sceptical. He has also suggested that campaigners are motivated \\"not so much by a dispassionate thirst for knowledge but more by an overwhelming desire to get rid of the psychiatrists\\" from the area of chronic fatigue syndrome, despite having himself published research which concluded that \\"the stereotype of CFS sufferers as perfectionists with negative attitudes toward psychiatry was not supported\\". When asked about severely affected bed-ridden patients, Wessely said \\"in that kind of disability, psychological factors are important and I don't care how unpopular that statement makes me.\\" Malcolm Hooper, the Countess of Mar, and others have strongly criticised Wessely. In a 2002 article on chronic fatigue syndrome, The Guardian characterized the criticisms of one group of patients as a \\"vendetta.\\" Wessely has repeatedly stated he has been the subject of numerous threats and personal attacks, and that \\"militants\\" have even made threats to his life. \\"It is a relentless, vicious, vile campaign designed to hurt and intimidate...For some years now all my mail has been x rayed. I have speed dial phones and panic buttons at police request and receive a regular briefing on my safety and specific threats.\\" Wessely gave up research into CFS around 2001, and as of 2011 his clinical work was with members of the armed forces; he said: \\"I now go to Iraq and Afghanistan, where I feel a lot safer\\". Military health Wessely's work was the first to show that service in the 1991 Gulf War had had a significant effect on the health of UK servicemen and women. Other work suggested a link to particular vaccination schedules used to protect against biological warfare, and also a link with psychological stress. His group also confirmed that classic psychiatric injury, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), was not a sufficient explanation for the observed health problems. He and his colleagues in the medical school showed persisting evidence of immune activation, but failed to show that exposure to organophosphate or cholinesterase inhibitor agents had caused chronic neurological damage. The group also showed that many veterans who left the Armed Forces with persisting mental health problems have found it difficult to access National Health Service (NHS) services. While this work, Wessely's evidence to the Lloyd Inquiry, and the work of other investigators was crucial in categorising Gulf War syndrome as a verifiable consequence of service in the Gulf, which resulted in affected Gulf War veterans being able to receive war pensions, Wessely does not believe that Gulf War syndrome exists as a distinct illness, stating \\"Is there a problem? Yes there is. Is it Gulf War syndrome or isn't it? I think that's a statistical and technical question that's of minor interest\\". Instead Wessely favours psychological explanations for what he views to be a 'Gulf War health effect' which he believes to be caused by stress, specifically troops' anxiety about chemical weapons and vaccines, as well as misinformation about Gulf War syndrome. He is a trustee of the charity Combat Stress that provides help for service personnel with mental health problems and recently spent a sabbatical in the Department of War Studies at King's College London. President of Royal College of Psychiatrists In 2014, Wessely was elected president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. He has used his position to argue for better resources for mental health and the treatment of mental disorders and holding the government to account. This included drawing attention to the large disparity between those receiving any form of treatment for physical disorders such as diabetes and those with serious mental health problems, making the case that we can successfully treat many mental health problems, and that patients with disorders do get better. He also argued that there were dangers in pulling out of the European Convention on Human Rights. As president he has been a regular media spokesperson such as on BBC current affairs programme Panorama, and that killings by those with mental illness are both unusual and declining. He has argued against making benefits conditional on co operating with mental health treatments, as subsequently accepted by the Carol Black report and warned psychiatrists against diagnosing Donald Trump, no matter how tempting this may be. He has also claimed to oppose lazy or negative stereotypes and images of psychiatry and false dichotomies such as ‚Äúphysical versus mental‚Äù or ‚Äúdrugs versus talking‚Äù and instead putting forward more positive images. For example on Any Questions in August 2014, he opposed the motion proposed by Will Self that psychiatrists were to blame for the current epidemic of mental disorders. During the junior doctors dispute he continued to emphasise support for junior psychiatrists whilst arguing that the deeper causes of the dispute went beyond pay and hours, comparing junior doctors careers to ‚Äúbeing shuffled around the country like lost luggage‚Äù and that it is impossible go on increasing demand and expectations with diminishing resources. Wessely was succeeded as President by Professor Wendy Burn in June 2017. Review of the Mental Health Act In October 2017 the Prime Minister Theresa May announced that she had chosen Wessely to conduct a review of the Mental Health Act. He stated in an interview with the Huffington Post \\"Reviewing the act isn‚Äôt just about changing the legislation. In some ways that might be the easy part. The bigger challenge is changing the way we deliver care so that people do not need to be detained in the first place. In my experience it is unusual for a detention to be unnecessary -- by the time we get to that stage people are often very unwell, and there seems few other alternatives available.\\" Other interests Wessely also has a long-standing interest in how normal people react to adversity, and what, if any, responses are appropriate. He was a co- author of an influential Cochrane Review showing that the conventional intervention for disaster survivors ‚Äì to offer immediate psychological debriefing ‚Äì was not only ineffective, but possibly did more harm than good. Since then he has published on civilian reactions to the Blitz, and latterly an early study of reactions to the 7 July 2005 London bombings, the Litvinenko affair, and swine flu. In many venues, he has argued that people are more resilient than we give them credit for, and that the best thing we can do in the immediate aftermath of trauma is to offer practical support and encourage people to turn to their own social networks, such as family, friends, colleagues or family doctor. However, after a few months, when most distress has reduced, then for the minority who are still psychologically distressed or disabled it is appropriate to offer evidence-based psychological interventions. After the GermanWings tragedy he suggested that we should not jump to conclusions such as banning all pilots from flying who had a history of depression (as opposed to current depression). He argued that the skies would be safer if pilots felt that the best way to be able to continue their careers was by being open and honest about their mental health, and not covering up, which would be the consequence of a lifetime ban. He advised the Civil Aviation Authority with the result that no such ban was instituted, but mental health assessments were improved. He worked with the CAA and BALPA to achieve his proposals. During the 2016 EU referendum he was one of the leaders of the Healthier IN campaign, making the case for science and health. He was a member of the Mental Health Taskforce, chaired by Paul Farmer, which led to the Five Year Forward View for Psychiatry. He was instrumental in setting up the Commission on Acute Psychiatric Care, chaired by Lord Crisp, to investigate the increasing numbers of inappropriate out of area placements ‚Äì over 5,000 patients a year being seen and hospitalised outside their local area, sometimes at the other end of the country. The report made recommendations which were incorporated into the Five year Forward View for Mental Health, accepted by NHS-England.  Personal life  Wessely‚Äôs father Rudi came to the UK in August 1939, one of the children rescued by Nicky (Sir Nicholas) Winton. Nearly all of Rudi‚Äôs family, including his parents, were murdered during the Holocaust. His father was the first of the ‚Äúchildren‚Äù to meet Winton nearly 40 years later. He has spoken passionately about issues affecting refugees supporting Alf Dubs legislation. Wessely is married to Clare Gerada; they have two sons. His interests include skiing and history, and he cycled annually from London to Paris between 2006 and 2012, to raise money for veterans' charities.  Publications  Wessely has co-authored books on CFS, psychological reactions to terrorism, randomised controlled trials, and a history of military psychiatry, From Shell Shock to PTSD. Honours For his work on CFS, Wessely was awarded the Jean Hunter Prize in 1997 by the Royal College of Physicians and was co-winner of the John Maddox Prize 2012 sponsored by Nature and the Ralph Kohn Foundation, and organised by Sense About Science on whose advisory council he serves. The award is given to individuals who have promoted sound science and evidence on a matter of public interest, with an emphasis on those who have faced extreme difficulty or opposition in doing so, as Wessely has done in researching neuropsychiatric elements to CFS despite alleged threats to his life. Some, however, have objected to this award being given to him due to concerns over the quality of his research. To balance these criticisms academic supporters would point out that he was appointed as a Foundation Senior Investigator of the National Institute for Health Research, which is given on very strict criteria including analysis of metrics/citations. The college of NIHR Senior Investigators is drawn from the most pre-eminent NIHR-funded researchers selected through annual competitions. He was also elected Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences, the medical equivalent of the Royal Society, in 1999. Only 40 are honoured per year, and it is the highest honour and professional recognition in UK academic medical science. His 2013 Knighthood was for services to Military healthcare and psychological medicine. In 2014, Wessely was elected president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. He announced his priorities to include parity between physical and mental health, improving the image of psychiatry and psychiatrists, improving recruitment into the speciality, and ensuring excellence in education and training. He was named in the Health Service Journal Top 100 Clinicians 2014, 2015. Listed in Debrett‚Äôs Top 500 as one of the 7 most influential doctors in the country. In 2013 he led the successful bid to the National Institute of Health Research to establish a Health Protection Research Unit (HPRU) for Emergency Preparedness and Response which he now chairs. In July 2017 he became the first psychiatrist to be elected as President of the Royal Society of Medicine. In February 2017 he was appointed as Regius Professor of Psychiatry at King's College London, the first Regius Chair at KCL and the first in psychiatry anywhere in the United Kingdom. At the Regius Professor of Psychiatry Inaugural Lecture, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, May 2017 On 26 June 2019 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Science by the University of Oxford.

Several non- binding resolutions were voted on and accepted by the UN condemning \\"defamation of religion\\". The motions, sponsored on behalf of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), now known as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, sought to prohibit expression that would \\"fuel discrimination, extremism and misperception leading to polarization and fragmentation with dangerous unintended and unforeseen consequences\\". Religious groups, human rights activists, free-speech activists, and several countries in the West condemned the resolutions arguing they amounted to an international blasphemy law. Critics of the resolutions including human rights groups argued that they were used to politically strengthen domestic anti-blasphemy and religious defamation laws, which are used to imprison journalists, students and other peaceful political dissidents.UN anti-blasphemy measures have sinister goals, observers say From 2001 to 2010 there was a split of opinions, with the Islamic bloc and much of the developing world supporting the defamation of religion resolutions, and mostly Western democracies opposing them. Support waned toward the end of the period due to increased opposition from the West along with lobbying by religious, free-speech, and human rights advocacy groups. Some countries in Africa, the Pacific, and Latin America switched from supporting to abstaining, or from abstaining to opposing. The final \\"defamation of religions\\" resolution in 2010, which also condemned \\"the ban on the construction of minarets of mosques\\" four months after a Swiss referendum introduced such a ban, passed with only 20 supporting, 17 opposing, and 8 abstaining. In 2011, with falling support for the defamation of religion approach, the OIC changed their approach and introduced a new resolution on \\"Combating intolerance, negative stereotyping and stigmatization of, and discrimination, incitement to violence and violence against, persons based on religion or belief\\" that received unanimous support. The UN Human Rights Committee followed this in July 2011 with the adoption of General Comment 34 on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) 1976 that binds signatory countries. Concerning freedoms of opinion and expression, General Comment 34 made it clear that \\"Prohibitions of displays of lack of respect for a religion or other belief system, including blasphemy laws, are incompatible with the Covenant\\". General Comment 34 makes it clear that countries with blasphemy laws in any form that have signed the ICCPR are in breach of their obligations under the ICCPR. United Nations resolutions Defamation of religion resolutions were the subject of debate by the UN from 1999 until 2010. In 2011, members of the UN Human Rights Council found compromise and replaced the ‚Äúdefamation of religions‚Äù resolution with Resolution 16/18, which sought to protect people rather than religions and called upon states to take concrete steps to protect religious freedom, prohibit discrimination and hate crimes, and counter offensive expression through dialogue, education, and public debate rather than the criminalization of speech. Resolution 16/18 was supported by both OIC member countries and Western countries, including the United States. 1999 In April 1999, at the urging of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), Pakistan brought before the United Nations Commission on Human Rights a resolution entitled \\"Defamation of Islam\\". The purpose of the resolution was to have the Commission stand up against what the OIC claimed was a campaign to defame Islam. Some members of the Commission proposed that the resolution be changed to embrace all religions. The Commission accepted the proposal, and changed the title of the resolution to \\"Defamation of Religions\\". The resolution urged \\"all States, within their national legal framework, in conformity with international human rights instruments to take all appropriate measures to combat hatred, discrimination, intolerance and acts of violence, intimidation and coercion motivated by religious intolerance, including attacks on religious places, and to encourage understanding, tolerance and respect in matters relating to freedom of religion or belief\\". The Commission adopted the resolution without a vote. 2000 to 2005 In 2000, the CHR adopted a similar resolution without a vote.http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/CHR/resolutions/E-CN_4-RES-2000-84.doc In 2001, a vote on a resolution entitled \\"Combating defamation of religions as a means to promote human rights, social harmony and religious and cultural diversity\\" received 28 votes in favour, 15 against, and 9 abstentions.http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/CHR/resolutions/E-CN_4-RES-2001-4.doc In 2002, a vote on a resolution entitled \\"Combating defamation of religion\\" received 30 votes in favour, 15 against, and 8 abstentions.http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/AllSymbols/AFE565E9560973C9C1256C93004A41E0/$File/G0215272.pdf?OpenElement In 2003, 2004, and 2005, by similar votes, the CHR approved resolutions entitled \\"Combating defamation of religions\\". In 2005, Yemen introduced a resolution entitled \\"Combating Defamation of Religions\\" in the General Assembly (60th Session). 101 states voted in favour of the resolution, 53 voted against, and 20 abstained. 2006 In March 2006, the CHR became the UNHRC. The UNHRC approved a resolution entitled \\"Combating Defamation of Religions\\", and submitted it to the General Assembly. In the General Assembly, 111 member states voted in favour of the resolution, 54 voted against, and 18 abstained. Russia and China, permanent members of the UN Security Councils, voted for the Resolution. 2007 On 30 March 2007, the UNHRC adopted a resolution entitled \\"Combating Defamation of Religions\\". The resolution called upon the High Commissioner for Human Rights to report on the activities of her office with regard to combating defamation of religions.http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A-HRC-RES-4-9.doc On 30 March 2007, the UNHRC adopted a resolution entitled \\"Elimination of all forms of intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief\\". The resolution called upon the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief to report on this issue for the Human Rights Council at its sixth session.http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A-HRC-RES-4-10.doc In August 2007, the Special Rapporteur, Doudou Di√®ne, reported to the General Assembly \\"on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance on the manifestations of defamation of religions and in particular on the serious implications of Islamophobia on the enjoyment of all rights\\". Among other recommendations, the Special Rapporteur recommended that the Member States promote dialogue between cultures, civilizations, and religions taking into consideration: On 4 September 2007, the High Commissioner for Human Rights reported to the UNHRC that \\"Enhanced cooperation and stronger political will by Member States are essential for combating defamation of religions\\". On 18 December 2007, the General Assembly voted on another resolution entitled \\"Combating Defamation of Religions\\". 108 states voted in favour of the resolution; 51 voted against it; and 25 abstained. The resolution required the Secretary General to report to the sixty-third session of the General Assembly on the implementation of the resolution, and to have regard for \\"the possible correlation between defamation of religions and the upsurge in incitement, intolerance and hatred in many parts of the world\\". 2008 On 27 March 2008, the UNHRC passed another resolution about the defamation of religion. The resolution : 21 members were in favour of the resolution; 10 were opposed; 14 abstained.http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_7_19.pdf The High Commissioner presented her report about defamation of, and contempt for, religions on 5 September 2008.High Commissioner's report 5 September 2008(A/HRC/9/25). She proposed the holding of a consultation with experts from 2 to 3 October 2008 in Geneva about the permissible limitations to freedom of expression in accordance with international human rights law. In another report, dated 12 September 2008, the High Commissioner noted that different countries have different notions of what \\"defamation of religion\\" means. Githu Muigai, Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, addressed the UNHRC on 19 September 2008. He delivered the report prepared by Doudou Di√®ne. The report called on Member States to shift the present discussion in international fora from the idea of \\"defamation of religions\\" to the legal concept: \\"incitement to national, racial or religious hatred,\\" which is grounded on international legal instruments. On 24 November 2008, during the Sixty-third Session, the General Assembly's Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian & Cultural) approved a resolution entitled \\"Combating defamation of religions\\". The resolution requests \\"the Secretary-General to submit a report on the implementation of the present resolution, including on the possible correlation between defamation of religions and the upsurge in incitement, intolerance and hatred in many parts of the world, to the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session\\". 85 states voted in favour of the resolution; 50 states voted against the resolution; 42 states abstained.Third Committee vote on defamation of religions Item 64(b) 24 November 2008. 2009 In February 2009, Zamir Akram, permanent representative of Pakistan to the United Nations Office at Geneva, in a meeting of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, commented on the \\"defamation of religion\\". He said \\"there was an impression that Pakistan was trying to put in place an international anti- defamation provision in the context of the Durban Review Conference\\". Akram said the impression \\"was totally incorrect\\". Akram's delegation said: In advance of 26 March 2009, more than 200 civil society organizations from 46 countries, including Muslim, Christian, Jewish, secular, Humanist and atheist groups, urged the UNHRC by a joint petition to reject any resolution against the defamation of religion. On 26 March 2009, the UNHRC passed a resolution, proposed by Pakistan, which condemned the \\"defamation of religion\\" as a human rights violation by a vote of 23‚Äì11, with 13 abstentions.http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/10session/A.HRC.10.L.11.pdf The resolution: Supporters of the resolution argued that the resolution is necessary to prevent the defamation of Islam while opponents argued that such a resolution was an attempt to bring to the international body the anti- defamation laws prevalent in some Muslim countries. On 1 July 2009, Githu Muigai, Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, submitted to the UNHRC the report requested by it on 26 March 2009. The report \\"reiterates the recommendation of his predecessor to encourage a shift away from the sociological concept of the defamation of religions towards the legal norm of non-incitement to national, racial or religious hatred\\".http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/12session/A-HRC-12-38_E.pdf On 31 July 2009, the Secretary General submitted to the General Assembly the report that it requested in November 2008. The Secretary General noted, \\"The Special Rapporteurs called for anchoring the debate in the existing international legal framework provided by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ‚Äì more specifically its articles 19 and 20.\\" The Secretary General concluded, \\"In order to tackle the root causes of intolerance, a much broader set of policy measures needs to be addressed covering the areas of intercultural dialogue as well as education for tolerance and diversity.\\" On 30 September 2009, at the UNHRC's twelfth session, the United States and Egypt introduced a resolution which condemned inter alia \\"racial and religious stereotyping\\".http://www.unitedstatesaction.com/documents/Oct2009-UNHRC/A_HRC_12_L.14_Rev.1-English.pdf The European Union's representative, Jean-Baptiste Mattei (France), said the European Union \\"rejected and would continue to reject the concept of defamation of religions\\". He said, \\"Human rights laws did not and should not protect belief systems.\\" The OIC's representative on the UNHRC, Zamir Akram (Pakistan), said, \\"Negative stereotyping or defamation of religions was a modern expression of religious hatred and xenophobia.\\" Carlos Portales (Chile) observed, \\"The concept of the defamation of religion took them in an area that could lead to the actual prohibition of opinions.\\"http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/6A69FF0F95283CE7C12576430046793B?opendocument The UNHRC adopted the resolution without a vote. In Geneva, from 19 to 30 October 2009, the Ad Hoc Committee of the Human Rights Council on the Elaboration of Complementary Standards met to update the measures for combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, and related intolerance that the Durban I conference had formulated. The committee achieved little because of conflict over a variety of issues including \\"defamation of religion\\". The United States said that defamation of religion is ‚Äúa fundamentally flawed concept‚Äù. Sweden, for the European Union, argued that international human rights law protects individuals, not institutions or religions. France insisted that the UN must not afford legal protection to systems of belief. Syria criticized the \\"typical and expected Western silence\\" on \\"acts of religious discrimination\\". Syria said \\"in real terms defamation means targeting Muslims\\". Zamir Akram (Pakistan) wrote to the Ad Hoc Committee on 29 October 2009 to explain why the OIC would not abandon the idea of defamation of religion. Akram's letter states: The letter says defamation of religion has been \\"wrongly linked with malafide intentions to its perceived clash with\\" the freedom of opinion and expression. The letter declares: In New York, on 29 October 2009, the UN's Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian & Cultural) approved a draft resolution entitled \\"Combating defamation of religions\\" by a vote which had 81 for, 55 against, and 43 abstaining. On 18 December 2009, the General Assembly approved a resolution deploring the defamation of religions by a vote of 80 nations in favour and 61 against with 42 abstentions. 2010 In March 2010, Pakistan again brought forward a resolution entitled \\"Combating defamation of religions\\" on behalf of the OIC. The resolution received much criticism. French ambassador Jean-Baptiste Mattei, speaking on behalf of the European Union, argued that the \\"concept of defamation should not fall under the remit of human rights because it conflicted with the right to freedom of expression\\". Eileen Donahoe, the US ambassador, also rejected the resolution. She said, \\"We cannot agree that prohibiting speech is the way to promote tolerance, because we continue to see the 'defamation of religions' concept used to justify censorship, criminalisation, and in some cases violent assaults and deaths of political, racial, and religious minorities around the world.\\" The UNHRC passed the resolution on 25 March 2010 with 20 members voting in favour; 17 members voting against; 8 abstaining; and 2 absent. 2011 In early 2011, with declining support for the defamation of religion approach and at the time of the Arab Spring, which was in part due to a lack of freedom of speech, political freedoms, poor living conditions, corruption, and rising food prices, there was a real possibility that another resolution on the defamation of religion would be defeated. The OIC shifted position and opted to pursue an approach that would gain the support from both OIC and Western countries.Yvonne Donders The United Nations and Freedom of Expression Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 397 On March 24, 2011, the UN Human Rights Council in a very significant move shifted from protecting beliefs to the protection of believers with the unanimous adoption without a vote of Resolution 16/18 introduced by Pakistan.Islamic bloc drops U.N. drive on defaming religion Reuters 25 March 2011 Among its many specific points, Resolution 16/18 on Combating intolerance, negative stereotyping and stigmatization of, and discrimination, incitement to violence, and violence against persons based on religion or belief, highlights barriers to religiously tolerant societies and provides recommendations on how these barriers can be overcome. The resolution calls upon all member states to foster religious freedom and pluralism, to ensure religious minorities are properly represented, and to consider adopting measures to criminalize incitement to imminent violence based on religion or belief. Other recommendations include creating government programs to promote inter- religious tolerance and dialogue, training government employees to be sensitive toward religious sensitivities, and engaging in outreach initiatives.Resolution 16/18 Berkley Centre for Religion, Peace & World Affairs, Georgetown University March 21, 2011 At a meeting on July 15, 2011, hosted by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation at the OIC/IRCICA premises in the historic Yildiz Palace in Istanbul and co-chaired by the OIC Secretary- General Prof. Ekmeleddin Ihsanogl, U.S. Secretary of State Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton and the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, together with foreign ministers and officials from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Senegal, Sudan, United Kingdom, the Vatican (Holy See), UN OHCHR, Arab League, African Union, gave a united impetus to the implementation of UN Human Rights Council Resolution 16/18 with the release of a Joint Statement.Mission of the United States, Geneva, Switzerland: Joint Statement on Combating Intolerance, Discrimination and Violence The text includes the following: :\\"They called upon all relevant stakeholders throughout the world to take seriously the call for action set forth in Resolution 16/18, which contributes to strengthening the foundations of tolerance and respect for religious diversity as well as enhancing the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms around the world. :Participants, resolved to go beyond mere rhetoric, and to reaffirm their commitment to freedom of religion or belief and freedom of expression by urging States to take effective measures, as set forth in Resolution 16/18, consistent with their obligations under international human rights law, to address and combat intolerance, discrimination, and violence based on religion or belief. The co- chairs of the meeting committed to working together with other interested countries and actors on follow up and implementation of Resolution 16/18 and to conduct further events and activities to discuss and assess implementation of the resolution.\\" In July, 2011, the UN Human Rights Committee adopted a 52-paragraph statement, General Comment 34 on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) 1976, concerning freedoms of opinion and expression. Paragraph 48 states: :Prohibitions of displays of lack of respect for a religion or other belief system, including blasphemy laws, are incompatible with the Covenant, except in the specific circumstances envisaged in article 20, paragraph 2, of the Covenant. Such prohibitions must also comply with the strict requirements of article 19, paragraph 3, as well as such articles as 2, 5, 17, 18 and 26. Thus, for instance, it would be impermissible for any such laws to discriminate in favor of or against one or certain religions or belief systems, or their adherents over another, or religious believers over non-believers. Nor would it be permissible for such prohibitions to be used to prevent or punish criticism of religious leaders or commentary on religious doctrine and tenets of faith.http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/GC34.pdf Article 20, paragraph 2 of the Covenant states: Any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law. The ICCPR binds all signatory countries. Consequently, countries with blasphemy laws in any form that have signed the ICCPR are in breach of their obligations under the ICCPR. On 19 December 2011, the UN General Assembly endorsed Human Rights Council Resolution 16/18 with the adoption of Resolution 66/167.

It provides for cooperation by the Department of the Interior and Department of Defense with state agencies in planning, development and maintenance of fish and wildlife resources on military reservations throughout the United States. The Sikes Act is \\"an act To promote effectual planning, development, maintenance, and coordination of wildlife, fish, and game conservation and rehabilitation in military reservations\\". In other words, it attempts to ensure that fish, wildlife and other natural resources that exist on and are associated with military lands in the United States are protected and enhanced. The Sikes Act is written such that conservation activities are promoted while allowing military lands to continue to meet the needs of military operations. The Sikes Act requires that conservation goals are cooperatively developed and recorded in a planning document called an Integrated Natural Resource Management Plan, or INRMP. Installation commanders are responsible for ensuring that INRMPs are completed for their installation and in cooperation with state and federal fish and wildlife agencies. An INRMP is only valid for a period of five years. Before the five year period ends it must be reviewed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, relevant state agencies and the military installation. If necessary, the INRMP is updated by the installation in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and state agencies. Cooperative conservation is an important provision of the Sikes Act, as currently amended. It provides military service programs and installations the ability to enter into partnerships with state and Department of Interior agencies (particularly the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) that advance natural resource conservation on military lands.

Isembert de Ch√¢telaillon, or Isembard de Castrum Allionis, also Isembert the Last, also spelled Isambert, was a French nobleman and the master of the city of Ch√¢telaillon in Charente-Maritime, a territory which covered the area between the S√®vre river in the north and the Charente river in the south and included R√© island and Aix island but not Ol√©ron island, in the early 12th century. Isambert, like all the Lords of Ch√¢telaillon was a vassal of the Duke of Aquitaine and Count of Poitou. The Ch√¢telaillon lineage is thought to have been founded by Alon, who gave his name to Castrum Alionensis (linguistically deformed into \\"Ch√¢telaillon\\"). Isembert was a descendant of the powerful Isembert I of Ch√¢telaillon who became prosperous through wine and salt trade, and sponsored the development of monasteries. Isembert I built the monastery of Ile d'Aix in 814, which was later invaded by the Normans and became one of their strongholds. Isembert was also the son of Eble II of Ch√¢telaillon, who was known for his depredation of local monasteries and was twice excommunicated as a consequence.Cultures of Power: Lordship, Status, and Process in Twelfth-Century Europe by Thomas N.

Etymology Biryulka is named after the small Bira River, the name of which in turn comes from an Evenk word. History In 1688, sixteen peasant families settled here. The founders were Stepan Alexandrovich and Mikhail Kostyakov. The Yakutsk stavlenik Onichkov allocated them an average of per family. It seems that seven of these families were exiles and nine were of freed serfs. The population increased quickly through natural increase and immigration. Other villages developed in the area around Biryulka. Biryulskaya Volost, subordinate to Yakutsk, was eventually established. In 1696, the inhabitants of Biryulka staged a revolt led by Pavel Khaletsky. At the beginning of the 20th century, well-known archeologist Alexey Okladnikov went to school here, but later moved to the selo of Anga where he finished secondary school in 1925. One of the streets in Biryulka is named after him. One of the battles of the Great Siberian Ice March, a retreat of the White Army east across Lake Baikal, took place near Biryulka in 1920. A number of inhabitants were arrested during the Great Purge. Politics Municipally, Biryulka is the administrative center of the Biryulskoye Rural Settlement in Kachugsky Municipal District, the head of which is Tatyana Sergeyeva, of the United Russia party who was elected in October 2009. Economy and infrastructure Biryulka is well known for the manufacture of shallow-draft river boats called shitiks, which have been used on the upper Lena for centuries. Near Biryulka is the archaeological site of Mokrushinsky burial ground. Work has been conducted since the 1980s, in part by students and archeologists. In 2006, a volunteer fire department was organized with its own fire-engine and a water tower. In winter, there is a winter road with an ice- bridge across the Lena River. This is the uppermost crossing of the Lena.

The non-profit organization was founded in 1994 and the current executive director of the organization is Debra Porta, who has served as the president of Pride Northwest since 2006. The organization is best known for organizing the annual Portland Pride Waterfront Festival and Parade. It is dedicated to celebrating and bringing visibility to the LGBTQ+ community in the Pacific Northwest.  Portland LGBT Pride Festival & Parade  Portland PridePortland's Waterfront Pride Festival and Parade is produced every June by Pride Northwest. Portland's Pride Weekend is normally scheduled the third weekend following Memorial Day, or the weekend after the conclusion of the Portland Rose Festival. It is a two-day-long event held along the Tom McCall Waterfront Park. The parade typically begins near West Burnside and Park Ave. and extends down Southwest Pine St. and Naito Parkway, finally ending near the Tom McCall Waterfront Park where the main festival is held. In 2019, the parade attendance was estimated to be 45,000 people and approximately 8,000 people from over 200 groups and organizations participated in the parade. The festival is one of the largest donation-based pride events on the West Coast with a suggested fee of $8 to enter the festival, however the fee is not mandatory and everyone is allowed to enter. The festival features official events that are listed on Pride Northwest's official website, typically including performances by LGBT talent, a ‚ÄúGaylabration‚Äù at Portland's Crystal Ballroom, the ‚ÄúBig Gay Boat Ride‚Äù on the Portland Spirit, and screenings of LGBT films. Many companies, businesses, churches, non-profits, agencies, sports teams, and LGBT organizations gather at the festival to celebrate and show support for the community. Pride Northwest executive director Debra Porta stated that they typically expect over 60,000 plus visitors to attend the festival. Porta encourages attendance for all families and people of any age, stating: ‚ÄúPortland Pride is considered to be one of the most family-friendly on the West Coast.‚Äù  History  Pride Northwest was established 1994, but Portland's first official pride event took place in 1975 when a group of approximately 200 people organized a Gay Pride Fair near the South Park Blocks by Portland State University. The following year the Portland Town Council sponsored a fair that was held at the Waterfront Park, and one year later in 1977 the annual parade was added in addition to the fair after Mayor Neil Goldschmidt formally announced a ‚ÄúGay Pride Day.‚Äù The parade and festival have since been celebrated annually and are organized by Pride Northwest. In June 1989 the leather pride flag was used by the leather contingent in the parade, which was its first appearance at a pride parade. According to its website, the organization's mission is \\"to encourage and celebrate the positive diversity of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans communities, and to assist in the education of all people through the development of activities that showcase the history, accomplishments, and talents of these communities.\\"  Police involvement and controversy  Police in Pride Parade, 2016 Portland police officers expressed outrage after LGBT organizers requested that officers who attend the festival and parade not show up in uniform. Executive director of Pride Northwest Debra Porta made a statement explaining the historic divide between marginalized communities and the police, stating that many members of the community do not feel comfortable attending the festival alongside law enforcement in uniform, stating in a letter to Portland police: ‚ÄúTo that end, we are asking LGBTQ and allied people in law enforcement, who plan to match in the Portland Pride Parade NOT to march in uniform.‚Äù Porta continued to state that though Pride Northwest does not have a preference if officers march in uniform, it is their duty as an organization to ask that officers give thought to the concerns of the community. The request was met with backlash notably from Portland LGBTQ officers who expressed anger and sadness that they must hide a part of their identity from their own community and that asking officers to not be visible erases the struggles many LGBTQ officers have faced coming out and being visible in a patriarchal institution like the police force. Porta responded to these concerns stating that ‚ÄúPride Northwest is a little caught in the middle‚Äù regarding this issue. Porta stated that they recognize the work that LGBTQ officers have done for the community and welcome officers to the parade no matter what, however also stating that the historic implications of the police uniform and how marginalized communities who have negative histories with law enforcement are affected should also be considered.  Traffic impact  The festival is known for having a large impact on Portland traffic that affects drivers downtown. The parade occupies Northwest Park Avenue and West Burnside Street and extends north on Southwest Broadway, east on Northwest Davis Street, and south on Naito Parkway. Drivers are encouraged to avoid parking near or along the parade route as cars parked within a two-block radius are removed. Traffic is also impacted by the festival that takes place at the Tom McCall Waterfront Park. The official parade route can be found on the Pride Northwest official website. Pride Northwest encourages festival and parade attendees and participants to use public transit, rideshare, and taxi services to reduce traffic impact.

Gr√©ville (born Edmond Gr√©ville Thonger; 20 June 1906 - 26 May 1966) was a French film director and screenwriter. He was married to the actress Vanda Gr√©ville. Career Gr√©ville began his career as a film journalist and critic. In parallel with a few acting performances in some silent films and in the first talkie of Ren√© Clair, Sous les toits de Paris (1930), he directed his first short films. His first experience of directing had been on the shooting of Abel Gance's Napol√©on in 1927. He had then worked as an assistant director, notably on the English film Piccadilly, L'Arl√©sienne (directed by Jacques de Baroncelli), Augusto Genina's Miss Europe (with Louise Brooks) and Abel Gance's La Fin du Monde. Between 1930 and 1940 he directed several French films: *Le Train des suicid√©s (1931) *Remous (1934) with Fran√ßoise Rosay, a social-realist film on the sensitive sexual issue of impotence, and released in the US in November 1939 under title Whirlpool of Desire after a legal battle over U.S. censorshipSusan Hayward French National Cinema; 2nd ed. (London: Routledge, 2005) p.185. *Two comedy musical films Princesse Tam Tam (1935) with Josephine Baker, and Gypsy Melody (1936), with Lupe V√©lez. In Britain again, he filmed Under Secret Orders (1937) with Dita Parlo and John Loder (1937), the English-language version of G. W. Pabst's Mademoiselle Docteur. Gr√©ville also directed Menaces (1938) with Mireille Balin and Erich von Stroheim, with von Stroheim playing an Austrian refugee who commits suicide following the Anschluss. With a heavy atmosphere charged with eroticism which characterizes his films, Gr√©ville imposed his independence and original style on the cinema of the time. He stopped directing films during the Second World War and the Occupation - xenophobia and anti-Semitism ruined or put a stop to some careers, among film-makers those of L√©onide Moguy and Pierre Chenal for example, both French Jews, and the half-British Gr√©ville, and took away production and distribution companies belonging to Jews like the father and son distributors Siriztky.Susan Hayward, French National Cinema; 2nd ed. (London: Routledge, 2005) In 1948 he made a film on the subject of resistance and collaboration in the Anglo-Dutch film Niet tevergeefs/But Not in Vain. The same year he made a film with Carole Landis, Noose, released in the U.S. as The Silk Noose. In House on the Waterfront (1954) he directed Jean Gabin as a captain confronted by an unscrupulous smuggler and torn by his love for a young woman who is also loved by a younger man. In Gr√©ville's last years he made Beat Girl (1959) with Adam Faith and a horror film The Hands of Orlac (1960) with Mel Ferrer. His last film was L'Accident (1963) with Magali No√´l based on a Fr√©d√©ric David novel. Personal life Gr√©ville was born in June 1906 in Nice, France, the adopted son of Franco-British parents. In May 1966, he died in hospital in Nice, thought to be the result of complications following a car accident. It was subsequently discovered through the 23andMe genetic testing of his daughter and grandson in 2017, that he was Ashkenazim Jewish, likely from the area of Odessa, based on the present whereabouts of his closest genetic relations today. Family speculation suggests that his parents fled the 1905 Russian pogrom to Marseilles, where he may have been discovered in the Nice hospital his English father, a Salvation Army colonel and Protestant pastor, was associated with. His true origin and that of his biological parents, remains a mystery.

The Cinnamon is currently recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) but not by the British Rabbit Council (BRC).  History  The Cinnamon rabbit was actually created accidentally by two children, Belle and Fred Houseman, during the Easter season of 1962 in Missoula, Montana. After crossbreeding their Chinchilla doe and their New Zealand buck, the children's father, Ellis Houseman, let the children keep one crossbred buck. After joining their local 4-H group, the children were given a Checkered Giant doe and a crossed Californian doe. After mating the crossed buck with each doe, the Californian doe produced one russet-colored bunny in its litter and the Checkered Giant eventually produced two bunnies with this russet-colored fur (one doe and one buck.) Ellis Houseman believed that only purebred rabbits should be kept for show, but he reluctantly allowed his children to keep the pair of russet-colored bunnies from the Checkered Giant's last litter. The children mated this pair together, and 70 percent of the litter had this new auburn shade of fur, which they began calling Cinnamon. Ellis noticed this new color and the fur's excellent sheen, and proceeded to present the rabbits to J. Cyril Lowett, Oregon ARBA Judge and board member at the time. Lowett declared that there was a strong possibility of the rabbits‚Äô ability in becoming an official breed, as there was no other breed like them in the United States. There are a couple of requirements needed for an unrecognized breed of rabbit to become an official breed according to ARBA. The Housemans needed to have their rabbits ‚Äúpassed‚Äù by three different ARBA conventions. The Housemans first took their Cinnamon's to the ARBA convention in Calgary, Canada in 1969. The Cinnamon's were immediately approved, so the family sent them to the 1970 convention in Syracuse, New York. Unfortunately, the family could not attend and therefore sent the rabbits to Syracuse by air freight. During this trip the rabbits contracted a virus that sickened and even killed some of them, and they were not passed by the convention due to their poor form and condition. In 1971 the Housemans continued their efforts for the Cinnamons to become an official breed, and the family took the rabbits to the 1971 convention in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Again there were some obstacles: the family hit a severe storm and had to abandon their trailer, and a dog broke into their rabbitry, killing three of their best does. However, the rabbits managed to pass the convention with good comments. The family finally reached their goal in 1972, when the rabbits passed their third convention in Tacoma, Washington and were officially recognized and accepted by the ARBA's Book of Standards.  Appearance  Named for its distinct coloration, the Cinnamon rabbit's coat is ideally rust or ground cinnamon with a uniform gray ticking across the back, smoky grey coloring on its sides, a dark underbelly, and an orange under-color all over. Rust-colored spots appear inside the hind legs and often also on the feet and face. The hind legs, feet, and face are generally darker than the rest of the body, producing a butterfly effect on the nose and small circles around each eye. The Cinnamon, weighing , is medium in length and has a commercial body. The hips are deeper and wider than the shoulders, the head is proportionate to the body, and the ears are erect. The ARBA standard for the Cinnamon rabbit awards, of the total 100 points, 58 points for body type: ideally a good, medium-sized body with smooth bone structure and good filled in flesh. The overall coloring and coat quality is awarded 11 points, with another 11 points for desired markings and color variations, including varying shades of rust and brown on the body and belly, plus a lighter gray dusting along the back.  Lifestyle & behavior  The Cinnamon is very adapted to pet use, and it is large enough for youth who want and can also handle a larger sized rabbit without being one that is too giant-sized to handle. The Cinnamon is a hardy breed- it tends to live between 5 and 8 years- and it is laidback, fairly calm, well disposed, and enjoys attention. Its coat is short and easy to care for, so weekly grooming with a slicker brush should be adequate for the majority of the year. However, biweekly grooming may be necessary during the shedding season. The Cinnamon, like any breed of rabbit, will benefit from a well-balanced diet, plenty of room to exercise, various toys to chew on, and plenty of time spent with its owner.  Food & housing  The Cinnamon Rabbit required a well balanced diet to remain healthy. Grass hay, cecotropes, and green foods are staples in the diet of a domestic rabbit. Grass hay can consist of timothy, meadow, oat, rye, barley or Bermuda grasses. If grass hay is not available, legume hay is an acceptable alternative. Legume hay is very rich with nutrients which a domestic rabbit does not need; therefore, it should only be an alternative. Flowers, fruits and vegetables are acceptable to feed a domestic rabbit but only in small amounts, not as an entire meal. Water should be constantly available for a rabbit. All rabbits should be raised indoors, and free roam is possible. If not, then a cage should be at least 3 feet by 4 feet of adequate space. It is possible to litter train a rabbit. The cage should be tall enough for the rabbit to stand on its back legs without hitting its head. The cage should be resistant to chewing, as well as big enough for the rabbit to have a rest area and a place to hide. If the rabbit is kept in a cage for the majority of the time, it should be taken out a few hours of the day for exercise to avoid health problems. Bedding such as a pelleted litter is also something that is beneficial for the rabbit's housing.  Uses  Rabbits tend to be bred for one of four things: meat, fur, show, or pet use. The Cinnamon rabbit is referred to as the ‚ÄúAll-Purpose Rabbit‚Äù because it fulfills all four of these purposes.  Meat  Cinnamons were originally bred as meat rabbits. Of the four parent breeds of the Cinnamon, the New Zealand, Checkered Giant and Californian are largely used meat rabbits (the New Zealand is the most popular meat rabbit in the country, followed by the Californian) giving the Cinnamon a high potential as a meat rabbit as well.  Fur  Cinnamons have been bred to achieve a specific coloring, which does not vary much between rabbits of the breed. This unique and appealing color makes it an ideal fur rabbit, but because it is a rare breed it is not used often.  Show  Cinnamons have become a popular breed in competitive showing as well. Some experienced rabbit breeders enjoy the challenge of breeding the cinnamon rabbit because acquiring them is difficult due to their low numbers. However, the cinnamon is also suited for the amateur shower who is not interested in breeding. The rabbit itself is a great specimen for show because it is a commercially designed rabbit with good musculature and size.  Pets  As pets, Cinnamons are a great option. They require a balanced diet, but little grooming and care. They are large rabbits, making them too difficult for a small child to handle on their own, which keeps both the rabbit and child from injury. The Cinnamon's large size and sturdiness also allows older children to handle the breed without fear of injuring it. The naturally calm temperament of a Cinnamon suits families who are looking for a pet rabbit because the rabbits enjoy human attention.

It is designed to visually represent arguments through diagrams that can be used for analysis and stored in Argument Markup Language (AML), based on XML. As free software, it is available under the GNU General Public License and may be downloaded for free on the internet. How it works The user interface is composed of a main window (diagramming), a schemes editor and the AraucariaDB online interface. When a text file is loaded into the program, the text is displayed in the left-hand panel of the main window. Highlighting portions of text before clicking on the right (larger) panel creates corresponding nodes at the bottom of that panel. Nodes can then be paired together by dragging one (which will be the premise) to the other (the conclusion). To each node may be attached a value such as the ownership of the proposition, or an evaluation specifying the degree of confidence placed in premise. Similarly, symbols can be added to the arrows to state the strength of the inference. In addition, the user may link arguments, supply missing premises (argument reconstruction) and use refutations. The diagram will always take the form of a tree structure in Araucaria. The user has the choice of translating the argument into standard diagram, Toulmin diagram or Wigmore diagram, Araucaria 3.1 being the first software to integrate the latter ontology and to address the translation issues between the different diagrams.Besnard, 2008, p357 While Araucaria helps identify the structure of an argument, it provides freedom of analysis resources. The scheme editor allows the user to create argumentation schemes, group them together and save them into a scheme set file. The scheme set is then applied to the diagram, entirely or in part. As an illustration, an argument scheme relying on symptoms could be applied to the following assertion: \\"The light has gone off. Therefore, the bulb must be broken\\", with critical questions intended to determine if the result could stem from another reason (such as \\"have all the lights in the flat gone off?\\"). The AraucariaDB Online Repository can be browsed to retrieve specific arguments to fit a diagram. Alternatively, an argument diagram, along with annotations, can be saved into the database.  Technical details  Araucaria was developed in Java in order to be supported on most platforms.\\"As part of the commitment to supporting diversity\\", Reed, 2004, p5 It is licensed under the GNU General Public License and complies with free software standards. Argument Markup Language (AML) was created to maintain the evolving relationship between text and diagram. To this end, tags are added to the text and specify the connection between each component. AML is designed to be an application of argumentation theory in artificial intelligence.Reed 2004, p10 Because it is based on XML, a standard widely used by developers, AML content can be accessed through other software that support XML. Likewise, AML data is easily available online after using style sheets to create HTML web pages. Araucaria itself is conceived to be compatible with other tools. One example of integration is the argumentation software library Argkit. and Besnard 2008, p366 The online corpus provision is an extension of the Araucaria project. Further integration is planned with other applications currently under development.Reed, 2004, p1  Applications  The software is aimed at providing both a pedagogical tool (enhancing the teaching of critical thinking skills thanks to diagramming) and a support for research within the fields of argumentation theory and informal logic. In addition, it fits professional purposes,Reed, 2007, p36 as it reduces the time needed to process data. Among the choices of diagram available to the user, Wigmore charts were intended to be used for legal case analysis. Argument mapping tools are particularly suited to professionals and scholars in the legal field who have a considerable amount of arguments required to be processed in a consistent manner. Araucaria has been used by magistrates in Ontario Courts to help with a large volume of relatively simple cases.Reed, 2007, p37 and Prakken, 2008, p453 The advantages of using Araucaria in both learning and teaching philosophy was considered by the program's authors, along with other scholars, in a paper published in 2006.Rowe, Macagno, Reed, Walton, 2006 They emphasized how much easier it is to explain and summarize philosophers' theories when arguments are visualized in a diagram. A qualitative survey was carried out among students revealing positive results.Rowe, Macagno, Reed, Walton, 2006, p122 Araucaria is similar to other pre-existing software in some of its applications. However, the authors' intention was to \\"fill a gap\\" in providing a tool able to \\"support both teaching and research in argumentation theory\\".Reed, 2001, p4 As of mid-2009, Araucaria is deemed to have approximately 10,000 users,Rahwan, 2009, p398 even though that is hard to assess with precision when it comes to software available for free on the internet. IP address logs show that the user base is very wide both on a geographical level (more than 40 countries) and on a sectoral level (range of domains including doctors, statisticians, lawyers and engineers).Okada, 2008, p177  Future developments  While Araucaria is arguably one of the most sophisticated diagramming software packages and enjoys an important user base, its interface and features may be viewed as outdated. According to Chris Reed, \\"a large-scale rewrite is underway, which provides AIF support\\".Rahwan 2009, p398 It is unknown if this rewrite will be the occasion to turn Araucaria into an online and/or collaborative program. An online tool supporting AIF, albeit with less comprehensive features, was recently developed by Reed's research group (ARG:dundee). An alpha version of this Online Visualisation of Argument (OVA) is available. In addition, one of Reed's long-time projects had been to tackle the limitations of computer diagramming induced by natural language interpretation, and to add a dialogic argumentation structure to the software. From October 2009 to March 2013, a research program called \\"Dialectical Argumentation Machines\\" is attempted to make a first step towards this objective.

If a person predicts a positive outcome in the relationship this can lead to increased attraction, however if a person predicts a negative outcome then he or she would pursue limited interaction or possibly relationship termination.Littlejohn, S. (2002). Theories of human communication. (7th Edition). China: Wadsworth Group. The processes of predicted outcome value directly link to continued relationship development and communication as well as stronger attraction and intimacy within the relationship. Predicted outcome value theory proposes that initial interaction behaviors serve two related functions in individuals' attempts to maximize future relational outcomes. First, communication is directed at reducing uncertainty (Berger & Calabrese, 1975) about new acquaintances to determine likely outcome-values for the relational future. Second, communication proceeds in a manner predicted to result in the most positive outcomes. In a broad sense, these outcome value predictions would lead to communicative attempts to terminate or curtail the conversation, to continue the entry-level conversation, or to escalate the conversation and relationship beyond this level. Attempts to continue or escalate would result from positive predicted outcome values, while attempts to terminate or curtail would result from negative predictions. Given this, predicted outcome value theory proposes that several specific behaviors associated with conversational termination-escalation should be related to predicted outcome value levels. Among these, Sunnafrank (1986) posits that predicted outcome value is positively related to amount of verbal communication, intimacy level of communication content, nonverbal affiliative expressiveness, and liking.Sunnafrank, Michael (1988). \\"Predicted Outcome Value in Initial Conversations.\\" Communication Research Reports, Vol 5. No 2, 169-172. Key propositions of predicted outcome value theory 1\\\\. Attraction increases as the predicted outcome value increases 2\\\\. Prediction of positive future outcomes leads to future interactions 3\\\\. Prediction of negative future outcomes ends future interactions 4\\\\. People focus and discuss topics in conversations that facilitate positive predicted outcomesBerger, C., Roloff, M., & Roskos-Ewoldsen, D. (2010). The handbook of communication science. (2nd Edition). London: Sage Publication, Inc. Related Predicted outcome value theory is an alternative to uncertainty reduction theory, which Charles R. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese introduced in 1975. Uncertainty reduction theory states that the driving force in initial interactions is to collect information to predict attitudes and behaviors for future relationship development. Sunnafrank challenges uncertainty reduction theory with his predicted outcome value theory in that initial interactions are not solely about reducing uncertainty within the relationship but motivated by the predicted outcome value. Sunnafrank ascertains that initial interactions only lead to continued relationship development after the person has determined future rewards and costs of that relationship. However, when looking at the relationships of the implications of both theories, there are many parallels. The propositions set forth by predicted outcome value theory by Sunnafrank almost exactly mirror the eight axioms of Berger and Calabrese's uncertainty reduction theory. When looking at predicted outcome value theory, there are positive and negative predicted outcome values (POV) that are produced based on initial interactions. When there are positive predicted outcome values, they align with all of the same positive implications of uncertainty reduction. In other words, when dealing with positive feelings after an initial interaction, the implications of how that initial interaction unfolded align with the axioms of uncertainty reduction theory. For example, 1.) Verbal Communication- There is a positive relationship between the amount of verbal communication and the predicted outcome value. If there is a positive POV between an initial interaction, both theories imply that verbal communication is most likely to increase. (This is the first axiom of uncertainty reduction theory and is the conclusion based on the second assumption of predicted outcome value theory.) Furthermore: Keating, Dave. \\"Lecture: Uncertainty Reduction Theory.\\" COMS351. California State University, Northridge. 28 February 2019.2.) Proxemics- According to predicted outcome value theory, proximity in space and comfort of closeness increases more with higher POV's. (According to uncertainty reduction theory, as uncertainty reduces, the more we allow people to be comfortable in proxemics of space and display acts of affection, making this a negative relationship. As uncertainty decreases, acts of proxemics increase.) 3.) Disclosure(-)- We are willing to disclose increasingly personal information the higher the initial POV's are. (Similarly, as uncertainty reduces, the more we also feel comfortable opening up about ourselves.) 4.) Reciprocity(+)- The higher the initial POV, the more likely a person is to feel that they don't have to, or need to, reciprocate a conversation. (As uncertainty reduces, there is less of an urge to reciprocate a conversation. In other words, as uncertainty reduces, it is more likely that a person is willing to listen to a one-sided conversation and not feel obligated or need to reciprocate an answer.) 5.) Similarity(-)- The higher the initial POV, the more likely it is that people feel similar to one another. (And as two people feel more similar to one another, uncertainty decreases. 6.) Liking(-)- The higher the initial POV, the higher probability is that a person likes the other, in terms of friendliness. (And as two people like each other increasingly more, uncertainty decreases accordingly.) 7.) Shared networking(-)- If two individuals have friends in common that they trust, the higher the initial POV is. (As a shared network of friends grows bigger and bigger, uncertainty decreases.) The only axiom that is disagreed upon the two, and is what differentiates the two based on their implications, is the idea of information-seeking. 8.) Information-seeking- According to predicted outcome value theory, the higher the initial POV's, the more likely it is that the two people engaged in initial conversation will want to learn more about one another. And on the contrary, if the POV is negative (meaning that the initial interaction was not good), it is more likely that the two will NOT want to learn more about the other person. Thus, according to predicted outcome value theory, this is a positive relationship. The higher the POV, the more two people will want to know more about each other. On the other hand, according to uncertainty reduction theory, if there is high uncertainty between two people, it is MORE likely that they will want to know more about each other in order to reduce uncertainty, making this a negative relationship. Theory developer Michael Sunnafrank is a Professor in the Department of Communication, College of Liberal Arts at the University of Minnesota, Duluth. He joined the faculty at UMD in 1990 after fourteen years of teaching and research at Michigan State University, University of California Davis, Arizona State University and Texas A&M; University. He was awarded his PhD and master's degrees by Michigan State University.http://www.d.umn.edu/comm/facultystaff/msunnafrank.php Sunnafrank continues to work on research testing predicted outcome value theory. Empirical support for predicted outcome value theory Sunnafrank's (1986) study examined a potential initial acquaintance association between perceived similarity and attraction may be present, though undetected, in previous interpersonal goals research and finds support for interpersonal goals claims regarding the perceived similarity/attraction relationship. The findings extended Sunnafrank (1983, 1984, 1985) and Sunnafrank and Miller's (1981) claim that attitude similarity and attraction are unassociated in beginning communicative relationships. While their research supports this claim for attitude similarity revealed in pre-acquaintance, it also shows that this claim generalizes to more normally occurring perceptions of attitude similarity produced during initial relational stages. The results strongly suggested that traditional beliefs about, and theoretical interpretations of, the attitude similarity/attraction association are incorrect, at least regarding the initial acquaintance period.Sunnafrank, Michael (Spring 1986). \\"Communicative Influences on Perceived Similarity and Attraction: An Expansion of the Interpersonal Goals Perspective.\\" The Western Journal of Speech Communication, 50, 158-170. Another study, \\"Predicted Outcome Value in Initial Conversations\\", provided the initial test of several predicted outcome value theory (Sunnafrank, 1986) propositions. Findings supported all hypotheses tested, and demonstrated that during initial conversations predicted outcome value is strongly and positively related to the amount of verbal communication, intimacy of communication content, nonverbal affiliation, liking and perceived similarity. More recent research was designed to investigate positive and negative predictors of possible relationships by focusing on decisions to engage in future dates. Interpersonal attraction, homophily, and nonverbal immediacy have been linked to the predicted outcome value of relationships during initial encounters. This study investigates how these variables influence date decisions in a six-minute speed-dating experience. Results indicated interpersonal attraction and nonverbal immediacy significantly predict predicted outcome value, but not future date decisions.Houser, Marian L. Horan, Sean M. Furler, Lisa A. (2008). \\"Dating in the fast lane: How communication predicts speed-dating success.\\" Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, Vol. 25, No. 5, 749-768. Featured research and theory development Michael Sunnafrank and Artemio Ramirez Jr., assistant professor of communication at Ohio State University, conducted research which was published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships in 2004 and also featured on ABC news. Sunnafrank and Ramirez studied 164 college freshmen over a nine-week period to determine the predicted outcome value of relationship development between strangers.Sunnafrank, M. & Ramirez, A., (2004). \\"At First Sight: Persistent Relational Effects of Get-Acquainted Conversations.‚Äù Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, Vol. 21. pp. 361-379. The study involved pairing two students of the same sex together the first day of class and introducing one another and then engaging in conversation for either three, six, or 10 minutes. Afterwards, researchers asked each student to predict the outcome of the relationship by describing it as a nodding acquaintance, casual acquaintance, acquaintance, close acquaintance, friend, and close friend. The students also completed extensive questionnaires about the other person to determine how much they liked one another (Sunnafrank & Ramirez, 2004). Over the nine-week period, Sunnafrank and Ramirez (2004) facilitated a classroom environment that allowed the students to continue to get to know one another. At the end of the nine weeks, those students who predicted positive outcomes developed strong relationships and their behavior indicated such as those students sat together in class and communicated on a regular basis. The strongest effect of the study existed in the relationships where there was a predicted negative outcome. If students decided after the initial interaction that they did not want the relationship to progress then the students acted accordingly by restricting conversation, avoiding eye contact, and avoiding each other period. Ramirez points out that there is power in first impressions. ‚ÄúPeople want to quickly determine if a person they just met is someone they are going to want to hang out with, or date, or spend more time with in the future. We don‚Äôt want to waste our time.‚ÄùGrabmeier, J. (2004). \\"First 10 minutes after meeting may guide future of relationship\\". Research Communications. Columbus, OH: Ohio State University. http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/1stimpre.htm One important point to consider about this study is that Sunnafrank says that college freshmen can be ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù in pursuing new friendships and relationships within social circles and that behavior tends to change over time. ‚ÄúIn most situations in life, our time is pretty much claimed by work and family matters, so even when you meet people you really like, chances are not much is going to happen. As life goes on and social networks become solidified, acting on that first impression becomes less likely.‚ÄùDye, L. (2004). \\"First impressions really matter\\". ABCNEWS.COM. https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=69942&page;=1 Sunnafrank concluded that other events throughout the course of relationships can change the predicted outcome value, which he calls ‚Äúsurprising events,‚Äù such as betraying one another‚Äôs trust by ‚Äúback stabbing‚Äù and that not all relationships turn out as originally predicted. However, in this study, it is apparent that initial impressions and interactions can determine the outcome of the relationship, which is the predicted outcome value theory. While the college freshmen had numerous opportunities to develop their relationships over the nine-week period, the first impressions made lasting impacts. References Sources *Griffin, E. A. (2005).

With Sir Arthur Chichester, who became Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1604, he lived on terms of intimacy, and several small offices of state, with a pension granted 5 November 1607, were bestowed on him in his youthful days.Lee, 1885 In the colonisation of Ulster, which began in 1608, Annesley played a leading part, and secured some of the spoils. In October 1609 he was charged with the conveyance of Sir Niall Garve O'Donnell and other Ulster rebels to England for trial. On 13 March 1611‚Äì12 James I wrote to the Lord Deputy confirming his grant of the fort and land of Mountnorris to Annesley \\"in consideration of the good opinion he has conceived of the said Francis from Sir Arthur's report of him\\". On 26 May 1612 Annesley was granted a reversion to the clerkship of the Checque of the Armies and Garrisons, to which he succeeded 9 December 1625. In 1614 County Armagh returned Annesley to the Irish parliament, and he supported the Protestants there in their quarrels with the Catholics. Meanwhile his sister Bridget Annesley, a lady of the bedchamber in the household of Anne of Denmark may have been able to promote his career.Lloyd Bowen & Simon Healy, 'ANNESLEY, Sir Francis (by 1584-1660)', The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1604-1629, ed. Andrew Thrush and John P. Ferris, 2010. In 1616 he was sworn of the Irish Privy Council. On 16 July the King knighted him at Theobalds; in 1618 he was acting as Principal Secretary of State for Ireland, although he may not have been formally appointed; on 5 August 1620 received from the king an Irish baronetcy; and on 11 March 1620‚Äì1 received a reversionary grant to the viscounty of Valentia, which had recently been conferred on Sir Henry Power, a kinsman of Annesley, who had no direct heir. In 1625 he was elected to represent the county of Carmarthen in the English parliament. Meanwhile, in 1622 Lord Falkland became Lord Deputy of Ireland. Dissensions between Annesley and the new governor in the council chamber were constant, and in March 1625 the Lord Deputy wrote to Conway, the English Secretary of State, that a minority of the councillors, \\"amongst whom Sir Francis Annesley is not least violent nor the least impertinent\\", was thwarting him in every direction. But Annesley's friends at the English court contrived his promotion two months later to the important post of Vice-Treasurer and Receiver-General of Ireland, which gave him full control of Irish finance, and in 1628 Charles I raised him to the Irish peerage as Baron Mountnorris of Mountnorris. In October of the same year an opportunity was given Annesley, of which he readily took advantage, to make Falkland's continuance in office impossible. He was nominated on a committee of the Irish privy council appointed to investigate charges of injustice preferred against Falkland by the Byrne Clan, who had held land in County Wicklow for centuries. The committee, relying on the testimony of corrupt witnesses, condemned Falkland's treatment of the Byrnes, and Falkland was of necessity recalled on 10 August 1629. On 13 June 1632 the additional office of Treasurer at Wars was conferred on Mountnorris. Sir Thomas Wentworth In 1633 the formidable Sir Thomas Wentworth, afterwards Earl of Strafford, became Lord Deputy, and Mountnorris soon discovered that he was determined to insist on the rights of his office far more emphatically than Falkland. Although they were related by marriage, Wentworth disliked Mountnorris from the first as a gay liver, and as having been long guilty, according to popular report, of corruption in the conduct of official duties. In May 1634 Wentworth obtained an order from the English Privy Council forbidding his practice of taking percentages on the revenue to which he was not lawfully entitled; this order Mountnorris refused to obey. Fresh charges of malversation were brought against him in 1635, and, after threatening to resign office, he announced that all intercourse between the Lord Deputy and himself was at an end, and that he would take his case to the king personally. Mountnorris's relatives took up the quarrel. His younger brother at a military review made an insulting gesture to Wentworth, who struck him with his cane in return, and another kinsman deliberately dropped a stool in Dublin Castle on Wentworth's gouty foot. At a dinner (8 April 1635) at the house of Lord Loftus, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, one of his supporters, Mountnorris boasted of this last act as probably done in revenge of the Lord Deputy's conduct towards himself; he referred to his brother as being unwilling to take \\"such a revenge\\", and was understood to imply that some further insult to Wentworth was contemplated. Downfall  Wentworth was now resolved to crush Mountnorris, and on 31 July following obtained the consent of Charles I to inquire formally into the Vice-Treasurer's alleged malversation and to bring him before a court-martial for the words spoken at the dinner in April. At the end of November a committee of the Irish Privy Council undertook the first duty, and on 12 December Mountnorris was brought before a council of war at Dublin Castle and charged, as an officer in the army, with having spoken words disrespectful to his commander and likely to breed mutiny, an offence legally punishable by death. Mountnorris demanded as the privilege of peerage, a trial before the Irish House of Lords: he was told brusquely that a military court knew nothing of his privilege. Wentworth appeared as a suitor for justice; after he had stated his case, and counsel had been refused Mountnorris, the court briefly deliberated in Wentworth's presence, and pronounced sentence of death. The Lord Deputy informed Mountnorris that he would appeal to the king against the sentence, and added, rather tactlessly: \\"I would rather lose my hand than you should lose your head.\\" In England the sentence was condemned on all hands; in letters to friends, Wentworth attempted to justify it in the cause of discipline, and even at his trial he spoke of it as in no way reflecting upon himself. The only real justification for Wentworth's conduct, however, lies in the fact that he had obviously no desire to see the sentence executed; he felt it necessary, as he confessed two years later, to remove Mountnorris from office, and this was the most effective means he could take. Hume attempts to extenuate Strafford's conduct, but Hallam condemns the vindictive bitterness he here exhibited in strong terms; and although Mr. S. R. Gardiner has shown that law was technically on Wentworth's side, and his intention was merely to terrify Mountnorris, Hallam's verdict seems substantially just. In the result Mountnorris, after three days' imprisonment, was promised his freedom if he would admit the justice of the sentence, but this he refused to do. On the report of the privy council's committee of inquiry he was stripped of all his offices, but on 13 February 1635‚Äì6 a petition to Strafford from Lady Mountnorris, which was never answered, proves that he was still in prison. In the petition she pleaded eloquently with Strafford to remove his \\"heavy hand\\" from her dear husband, and appealed to the memory of his beloved second wife Arabella Holles, who was her cousin. She later managed to gain entry to his house, and went on her knees to him: Wentworth treated her courteously but remained implacable. Later in the year Lady Mountnorris petitioned the king to permit her husband to return to England, and the request was granted. Life after Strafford The rest of Mountnorris's life was passed in attempts to regain his lost offices. On 11 May 1641 he wrote to Strafford enumerating the wrongs he had done him, and desiring, on behalf of wife and children, a reconciliation with himself, and his aid in regaining the king's favour. But other agencies had already been set at work in his behalf. A committee of the Long Parliament had begun at the close of 1640 to examine his relations with Strafford, and on 9 September 1641 a vote of the commons declared his sentence, imprisonment, and deprivations unjust and illegal. The declaration was sent up to the House of Lords, who made several orders between October and December 1641 for the attendance before them of witnesses to enable them to judge the questions at issue; but their final decision is not recorded in their journals. In 1642 Mountnorris succeeded by special remainder to the viscounty of Valentia on the death of his cousin Sir Henry Power. In 1643 the House of Commons granted him permission, after much delay, to go to Duncannon in Ireland. In 1646 he was for some time in London, but he lived, when not in Ireland, on an estate near his birthplace, at Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, which had been sold to him by Charles I in 1627. In 1648 Parliament restored him to the office of Clerk of the Signet in Ireland, and made him a grant of ¬£500. Later he appears to have lived on friendly terms with Henry Cromwell, the Lord Deputy of Ireland during the Protectorate, and to have secured the office of Secretary of State at Dublin. In November 1656 he proposed to the English Government that he should resign these posts to his son Arthur. Henry Cromwell, writing to General Fleetwood, urges him to aid in carrying out this arrangement, and speaks in high terms of father and son. Lord Mountnorris died in 1660. Family  He married firstly Dorothea (died 1624), daughter of Sir John Philipps, 1st Baronet of Picton Castle, Pembrokeshire, and his first wife Anne, daughter of Sir John Perrot, and they had eleven children of whom three sons and several daughters reached adulthood. He married secondly Jane (died 1683/4), widow of Sir Peter Courten, 1st Baronet, of Aldington and daughter of Sir John Stanhope and his second wife Catherine Trentham, and half-sister of Philip Stanhope, 1st Earl of Chesterfield, and they had nine children of whom at least one son and one daughter reached adulthood. Valentia died and was buried in Thorganby, Yorkshire, in November 1660. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Arthur, who was later created Lord Annesley and Earl of Anglesey.

In New South Wales, Australia, pockets of later-deposited beds (usually reddish) are widespread in the Silurian-Devonian limestones. These are thus far reported only from the Lachlan Fold Belt portion of the Tasman orogenic zone. They are mostly small pockets but occasionally reach up to several metres wide. These had been long known about and began to be referred to as Caymanite by Dr. Armstrong Osborne who also worked up and published the finding that the Jenolan cave complex is world's oldest known and dated open cave system. The best description so far of the New South Wales caymanite is from Jenolan Caves. None of the NSW material is silicified or in any way suitable for use as a semi-precious stone. Formation The formation of caymanite followed two phases. The first phase of caymanite formation occurred after deposition, lithification, and karst process of the Oligocene Cayman Member. The second phase of caymanite formation occurred after joints had developed in the Middle Miocene Pedro Castle Member. Caymanite deposition predated dolomitization, a process where limestone is altered from contact with magnesium-rich water. Then the magnesium carbonate replaces the calcite naturally in the rock without complete destruction of the original sedimentary fabrics or structures. Dolomitization in the Bluff Formations of Cayman Brac occurred 2-5 million years ago.Suzanne M. Pleydell, Brian Jones, F. J. Longstaffe, H.

His innovations included the V8 engine, direct fuel injection, and liquid engine cooling. Primarily associated with the Antoinette company, he continued to experiment with aircraft design after the company went bankrupt. Early life Levavasseur was born in Le Mesnil-au-Val, Cherbourg, France to a naval officer. Initially studying fine arts, Levavasseur switched to studying engineering, with a particular interest in arc lamps and petrol engines. The Antoinette company The engine enterprise and incorporation 1909 Antoinette VII aircraft with Antoinette, the world's first V8 engine In the summer of 1902, Levavasseur suggested to industrialist Jules Gastambide that powerful, lightweight engines would be necessary for powered flight, and proposed the manufacture of these engines. He also proposed that the engines be named after Gastambide's daughter, Antoinette. Gastambide financed the venture. Levavasseur patented the V8 engine configuration that year. By 1904, most of the prize-winning speedboats in Europe were powered with Antoinette engines. During this time, he designed engines of various configurations of up to thirty-two cylinders. The Antoinette company was incorporated in 1906, with Gastambide as president and Levavasseur as technical director. The vice-president was aviation pioneer Louis Bl√©riot. The company's primary business was the sale of engines to aircraft builders. Levavasseur's Antoinette engines often included advanced features, including direct fuel injection and liquid engine cooling. Aircraft manufacture Antoinette IV designed by Levavasseur in 1908 Levavasseur experimented with the construction of aircraft and in 1906 the Antoinette company was contracted to build an aircraft for Captain Ferdinand Ferber. Bl√©riot tried to dissuade the directors of Antoinette from becoming aircraft manufacturers, fearing that they would begin competing against their own customers. Bl√©riot left the company when his advice was ignored. Aircraft promotion with Hubert Latham In the spring of 1909, Antoinette pilot Hubert Latham made several impressive flights. This convinced Levavasseur that Latham could cross the English Channel in an Antoinette aircraft and win the Daily Mail prize for doing so. Latham made two attempts to cross the English Channel in July 1909, both of which were unsuccessful due to engine failure while over the Channel. Between Latham's attempts, former Antoinette vice-president Bl√©riot successfully crossed the Channel in his own aircraft. That month, Levavasseur was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. Latham's efforts to promote Levavasseur's Antoinette products were more successful at the Grande Semaine d'Aviation de la Champagne on 22‚Äì29 August 1909 at Reims, France, where he won the altitude prize, finished second in the speed competition, took third place in the Gordon Bennett Cup for aeroplanes, and, in the Grand Prix event, trying to fly the longest distance around the circuit in a single uninterrupted flight, he won second prize in one aircraft (an Antoinette IV) and fifth prize in another (an Antoinette VII). Turbulent times and the end of Antoinette Levavasseur left the Antoinette company in November 1909. He returned to the company as the technical director in March 1910. After his return, he designed the Antoinette military monoplane, known as the Monobloc, a streamlined monoplane with cantilever wings. Due to its enormous weight and underpowered engine, it was unable to take off during the 1911 military trials held at Reims and was rejected by the military. The Antoinette company went bankrupt shortly afterward. After Antoinette Levavasseur began working on an aircraft with variable wing surface in late 1918. The variable area wing design won Levavasseur a \\"Safety in Aeroplanes\\" prize and was later acquired by the French government. Levavasseur died in poverty in February 1922.

Standardville was established after coal was discovered in the area in 1912. The layout of the town was so well-planned, it became the \\"standard\\" for all mining towns to follow, which resulted in the town name of Standardville. In 1922, a group of striking miners killed a mine guard and wounded two miners before escaping. In 1930, 20 miners were killed in a mine explosion caused by carbon monoxide gas. In 1950, the mine shut down and people began to relocate elsewhere. A couple families remained until the 1970s, after which Standardville was abandoned.  History  The town was established after coal was discovered in Spring Canyon in 1912. The town layout was planned with well maintained lawns, bushes, and poplar trees. This became the \\"standard\\" for coal mining towns in Spring Canyon, and the town was named Standardville. As Standardville's population increased, a company store, several apartments, a butcher shop, a barber shop, a hospital, a recreation hall, tennis courts, and an elementary school were constructed. At its peak, the population was about 550. Although it was considered the standard for mining towns, Standardville still had problems with crime. On June 14, 1922, several miners went on strike and attacked a train carrying several new miners from both sides. The striking miners then fled and were pursued by mine guards. The shooting that occurred killed a mine guard and wounded two others. On February 6, 1930, an explosion caused by firedamp gas occurred in the Standard mine. Of the 29 miners that were working in the mine, 20 were immediately killed by the explosion. Rescue workers attempted to rescue the nine survivors, and while they were searching, a cave-in killed three of them. The nine survivors were able to escape. The explosion had a large impact on the mine and community; however, the town continued to grow. When World War II ended, the demand for coal decreased, and the mine was unable to meet its payroll as a result. In an attempt to save the mine, miners worked only for food. This attempt was unsuccessful, and the mine went bankrupt and was foreclosed on. Another coal mining company bought it, and shipments continued a couple months later. By 1948, the mine was being operated by the Spring Canyon Coal Company; however, in 1950, the mine was closed. As miners moved away, shops, the hospital, and the school were closed. Despite this, two families continued to live in the town until the 1970s. Remnants The coal tipple has deteriorated, leaving behind the coal storage unit. Numerous foundations can be found. At the top of the hill lies the bath house, where miners bathed and changed clothes. Remains of the Standard Mine can be found beyond the bath house. Railroad tracks that were once the property of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad end in town. Due to its proximity to the road, many of the remnants have graffiti. The town is now fenced off and posted as private property, but most of the ruins can be seen from the road. Demographics Standardville was included in the United States Census twice. The Census of 1930 showed 506 people living in town. By 1940, Standardville's population had increased to 532. By 1950, Standardville's population had dropped considerably enough to not be included in that year's census.

The community was known as Harvey's Creek Settlement before the U.S. Civil War. After the war ended Gail Borden returned to Texas and, at what would become Borden, built houses for himself, his brother, and his sons. He renamed the settlement Bordenville. The Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway opened its line through the Borden area in 1872. In 2000, Borden had 60 residents. Government and infrastructure The area post office opened on January 19, 1874, and John P. Borden became the postmaster. In 1905 the post office closed and mail was rerouted through Weimar. In 1938, the Texas Highway Department announced plans to construct a lake and roadside park in Borden. The lake and roadside park are the only visible infrastructure of years gone by in Borden. The lake was to be constructed along US 90, then called the Houston-San Antonio State Highway No. 3. The Feb. 18, 1938 Eagle Lake Headlight announced that the new seven-acre lake ‚Äúdestined to become one of the main attractions,‚Äù along the Houston-San Antonio highway. Work began on the project by February, 1938, with ‚Äúa modest beginning as a roadside park,‚Äù according to The Headlight. The lake was to be placed approximately 440 yards from what was the existing highway and directly west of State Highway 3, which eventually became Interstate 10. State Highway 3 bypassed Borden at what is now Haterman Lane. A creek then running through the site was to be dammed to fill the lake. ‚ÄúWorkmen are busy now in damming up the creek, pulling down a hill in this vicinity, and utilizing dirt from this elsewhere to form baks for the new lake,‚Äù M.B. Hodges, state highway division engineer from Yoakum told The Headlight in 1938. Initial plans for the lake included eventual stocking with fish, and a multi-year moratorium on fishing prior to opening the lake to ‚Äúsports enthusiasts.‚Äù Education During the boon times of the 1870s, Borden also built a school for white children and a freedmen's' school for black children. The Weimar Independent School District serves Borden. In 1948 the Borden area schools were consolidated into the Weimar Independent School District.

In 1924, Frank and Josephine Duveneck founded this working organic farm and wilderness area on land comprising the upper Adobe Creek watershed on the foothills of Black Mountain in Los Altos Hills, California, part of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Hidden Villa is important historically as the site of the West's first American youth hostel and the nation's first multicultural children's summer camp. History Hidden Villa shelters many California native plants such as this native honeysuckle Lonicera hispidula 2010 photovoltaic system, passive solar heating and cooling, trombe wall, thermal mass, and straw bale construction. Plaque commemorating 1933 founding of the Loma Prieta Chapter of the Sierra Club lies on Adobe Creek Trail above Hidden Villa Ranch. The land between Moody Road and Adobe Creek was part of the Rancho La Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n land grant given in 1840 to Jos√© Gorgonio and his son Jos√© Ramon, Ohlone Indians of Mission Santa Clara, by Governor Juan Alvarado. George Washington Moody built Moody Road in 1867, from the Mountain View Railway station through what is now Hidden Villa Ranch to connect to Mayfield- Pescadero Road (now Page Mill Road). Moody was a farmer and native of Missouri whose home ultimately became Hidden Villa Ranch. Moody‚Äôs home was located on present day Moody Creek. In 1887, the 600-plus acres of Hidden Villa were purchased by Otto Arnold, a native of Saxony. Mr. Arnold accompanied Governor Milton Latham to America, and became a resident of San Francisco in 1864 where he, along with Latham, was connected with the London and San Francisco Bank Ltd (now MUFG Union Bank). After the death of his widow, Elvira Arnold, in 1904, Hidden Villa was owned by Captain George Ewing, for whom Ewing Hill (the source of the West Branch of Permanente Creek) is named. Frank Boott Duveneck, son of the painters Frank Duveneck and Elizabeth Boott, and his wife Josephine, daughter of Henry Melville Whitney, bought the then 1,400 acres of Hidden Villa in 1923 for \\"$10 in gold coin and the payment of a $20,000 mortgage\\". The Duvenecks remodeled the White House at Hidden Villa, which dates from the 1860s, when it was built as a stagecoach stop and inn for a stage running from San Jose to Pescadero. The White House was also known as the Halfway House because it was halfway between the two cities (eight miles from each one). In 1930 the Duvenecks built their permanent home on the knoll. Frank Duveneck founded the Loma Prieta Chapter of the Sierra Club with 53 charter members in 1933. It was the 4th chapter founded in the club and its founding is marked by a placard at the top of the Creek Trail. Frank and Josephine were also founders of Friends Outside, a support group for prisoners and their families. The Duvenecks sheltered Japanese-Americans returning from internment camps and provided safe harbor for C√©sar Ch√°vez as he organized farm workers in the fifties. In 1937, Frank and Josephine Duveneck opened the West's first American youth hostel at Hidden Villa. The nation's first multicultural children's summer camp has operated there since 1945. Hidden Villa was incorporated as The Trust for Hidden Villa, 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation, in 1960. Hidden Villa‚Äôs Environmental Education Program was launched in 1970. Hidden Villa was donated, by the whole Duveneck family, to the people of the region upon Frank's death in 1985. It was a major concern of the Duvenecks that the headwaters of Adobe Creek would be protected so that the water would never be polluted. They purchased land to protect the entire upper watershed, growing Hidden Villa to 1600 acres, creating one of the few virginal watersheds in the Bay Area. By 1982, the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District had purchased conservation easements on 1,560 of the 1,600 acres, leaving only the lower 40 acres for possible development. This fulfilled the wishes of the Duvenecks, as Josephine Duveneck records in her book Life on Two Levels, \\"Our family came to the agreement that a large part of the wilderness area, including the creek and its pristine watershed, should be dedicated at our death to public use as a permanent wild life sanctuary.\\" Educational programs Hidden Villa's educational programs include environmental education, day and residential summer camps, community programs on sustainability, animal husbandry and nature, and its community supported agriculture program which supplies local, organic, and sustainably grown produce to neighboring communities and service organizations. Attendance is 30,000 persons per year for these educational programs. Outside of the formal educational programs, children, adults, and families can visit with farm animals, explore the farm's gardens or hike on the surrounding eight miles (13 km) of trails. Hiking Hidden Villa is almost surrounded by open space including Monte Bello Open Space Preserve and Rancho San Antonio Open Space Preserve. The farm complex and hostel are located in a valley at about above sea level, and the hiking trail along the east fork of Adobe Creek, the \\"Creek Trail\\", is an easy two mile hike along the wooded canyon just above Hidden Villa where the creek still flows year-round. Two routes connect Hidden Villa to the Black Mountain Trial at Ewing Hill at of elevation, the Hostel Trail (1.3 miles) or the Creek Trail (1 mile) connecting to the Ewing Trail (0.3 miles). The Black Mountain Trail then continues up a strenuous to the summit of Black Mountain. Ecology Loss of streamside (riparian) vegetation increases stream velocity, causing downstream erosion and channel incision (dark gully behind tree) This drop under the Hidden Villa bridge is one of several barriers to steelhead trout spawning runs on Adobe Creek Steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) occurred historically in Adobe Creek with reports of the fish being in Adobe Creek in the Sportsman Gazetteer for 1877 and again in 1898 in a report to the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries based on collections likely made in 1898. The reaches upstream from Hidden Villa have been judged excellent trout habitat. Local historian Florence Fava also reported that \\"the creeks which lace the property and join Adobe Creek were originally full of fish\\". Adobe Creek was once a perennial stream, as steelhead trout young spend their first year in fresh water and obviously cannot survive in streams that run dry seasonally. Historically lawsuits were filed to prevent diversion of creek water for irrigation because they caused the creek to run \\"dry certain seasons of the year\\". This written record confirms oral histories taken by local historian Don McDonald that Adobe Creek used to flow year-round. A 1909 land office brochure promoted Los Altos for its \\"never-failing mountain trout stream, trout caught a few feet from kitchen doors\\". The California Native Plant Society's Santa Clara Valley Chapter maintains a native plant nursery at Hidden Villa, and holds two plant sales annually in April and October. The Santa Clara Valley Chapter serves Santa Clara County and southern San Mateo County. Development Controversy In March, 2008, Hidden Villa leased ten acres of its land to the nonprofit charitable organization, Heifer International, providing the former with $100,000 per year in rental income. However, Heifer International's plans to develop a development comprising a support center and several structures that would depict Third World country villages within of Adobe Creek, has met with opposition from Los Altos Hills residents. Hidden Villa zoning is managed by Santa Clara County which requires a setback from the creek's bank. One concern of residents is risk of flooding from development on the creek's floodplain on Hidden Villa property, as the creek has a history of flooding, with flood damages occurring in 1952, 1955, 1983, 1986, 1995 and 1998. A letter to the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors from FEMA designated a strip through the lower fields as having a 1 in 500 year chance of flooding. Heifer estimated that approximately 10,800 visitors annually would visit the 8.5 acre site, which would work out to about 45 students on any given day. The project has since been cancelled.

Released on Sugar Hill Records October 17, 2000 and re-released in an Expanded Edition on Landreth‚Äôs own LandFall Records April 21, 2009. Overview Levee Town expands on the themes and musical styles exhibited on Landreth‚Äôs first two major label releases Outward Bound (1992) and South of I-10 (1995). The record shows a maturity in writing and production as well as a continuing evolution in Landreth‚Äôs unique slide guitar playing. The production utilizes a mixture of arrangement styles that befits the range of musical material - introspective singer songwriter (\\"Love and Glory\\"); bare bones 3 piece instrumentals (\\"Z. Rider\\"); ‚Äúdouble-clutch‚Äù Zydeco grooves (\\"The U.S.S. Zydecoldsmobile\\"); Memphis style horn arrangements (\\"Angeline\\"); swamp pop (\\"Soul Salvation\\"); a mash up of New Orleans musical textures (\\"Deep South\\"); and the exuberant bayou groove and guitar showcase of the title song (\\"Levee Town\\"). Front and center throughout is Landreth‚Äôs exceptional slide guitar. Writing Landreth toured extensively for two years after the 1995 release of South of I-10, but during that time he began to write the songs that would form the core of his next album. Levee Town contains story songs reflecting his life and friends around his Louisiana home. Inspiration cited by Landreth for the songs comes from a wide mix of influences; Robbie Robertson‚Äôs writing for The Band; Joseph Campbell‚Äôs works on myth; Kahlil Gibran‚Äôs The Prophet; Richard Ford‚Äôs novel The Sportswriter; Longfellow‚Äôs Evangeline; Plato‚Äôs Protagoras; a 1982 Oldsmobile 98 beast of a car that was a gift to Landreth from his parents; and as always the legends, music, myth, and people of the Louisiana Gulf Coast Bayou region where Landreth grew up and still lives. All of the songs on the album were written solely by Landreth except \\"Angeline\\" which is a collaboration with songwriter Will Jennings. Jennings also co wrote \\"For Who We Are (The Night Bird Sings)\\" which was recorded for Levee Town (featuring Jennifer Warnes) but not released until the 2009 Expanded Edition. \\"The Going On\\", a song collaboration with songwriter Wendy Waldman, was written and recorded for Levee Town but not included on the record. It was later re-recorded and released on Landreth‚Äôs 2008 album From the Reach. Demos for the songs took shape at Landreth‚Äôs home studio throughout 1996-1997. By 1998 music producer and TV/film composer Mike Post had become a friend of Landreth‚Äôs and expressed an interest in the project. Post offered his WestWind Media studio in Burbank CA as a place to record basic tracks. WestWind Media was primarily a post-production facility but one wing of the building contained a large well designed tracking room and a control room with a vintage Neve console making the studio a perfect place to capture live tracks. Recording Tracking and overdubs took place at WestWind throughout 1998 with Landreth (guitars), longtime associate David Ranson (bass), and Michael Organ (drummer) tracking the songs live. Ranson a well known and well regarded bass player from Louisiana had performed and recorded with Landreth for three decades and understood the nuances of the music better than anyone. Organ, an accomplished rock drummer with enough finesse to capture the Louisiana groove influences of the music, had played with Landreth since 1995. Mike Post provided production and arrangement support and played keyboards. Post associate Cary Butler was the primary engineer. Some overdubbing was also completed in a secondary studio at Mike Post Productions. Basic tracks recorded with Post that appear on the final record are ‚Äì \\"Levee Town\\", \\"This River\\", \\"Love and Glory\\", \\"Spider-Gris\\", \\"Godchild\\", \\"Turning With the Century\\", \\"Angeline\\", and \\"Deep South\\". On \\"Godchild\\" and \\"Deep South\\" Landreth had become very fond of the guitar tracks he had recorded on demos in his home studio, so the ADAT demos were transferred to 24 Track 2 inch tape, the bass and drum tracks were then replaced at WestWind by Ranson and Organ - keeping the demo guitar tracks intact. In 1999 and 2000 tracking and overdubbing moved to Dockside Studio in Maurice just outside Lafayette, Louisiana. Dockside was owned by Landreth‚Äôs friends Steve and C√©zanne Nails and was another studio with a great Neve recording console and an ample tracking room as well as the advantage of being close to home for Landreth. David Ranson (bass) and Michael Organ (drummer) were once again the rhythm section and long time Landreth friends Tony Daigle (engineer) and R.S. Field (producer) worked on the tracks. Songs recorded at Dockside included \\"The U.S.S. Zydecoldsmobile\\", \\"Broken Hearted Road\\", \\"Z. Rider\\", and \\"Soul Salvation\\". Several other tracks were also recorded, some for a proposed instrumental album that was never completed. Three of those tracks, \\"Pedal To Metal\\", \\"Old Flame\\", and \\"Fare You Well\\", appear on the 2009 Expanded Edition release. Guests Many of Landreth‚Äôs longtime musical friends appear as guests on Levee Town. Steve Conn (Keyboards on most tracks); Stephen Bruton (guitar on \\"Soul Salvation\\"); Bonnie Raitt (vocals on \\"Soul Salvation\\"); John Hiatt (vocals on \\"Levee Town\\"); Marce LaCouture (vocals); Michael Doucet (fiddle); Errol Verret (accordion); Danny Kimbal (rubboard); Zydeco Joe Mouton (accordion). Jennifer Warnes and Herb Pedersen, both accomplished singers in their own right, sing background vocals on most of the album. The Legendary White Trash Horns appear on both \\"Angeline\\" and \\"Deep South\\". The horn parts were recorded as overdubs at Dockside with arrangement help from Post. Bonnie Raitt‚Äôs vocal contribution to \\"Soul Salvation\\" was recorded at Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin Ireland while she was on a trip abroad. Mixing Recording and overdubs for the album were completed by summer of 2000 and mixing for Levee Town was handled primarily at Dockside Studio by a combination of Landreth, Daigle, and Field. Release, reception, and re- release After over two years of production, and the complications of Landreth changing labels and management, Levee Town was released in October 2000 on Sugar Hill Records. Critical reception was very favorable, but Sugar Hill may not have been able to supply appropriate publicity and promotional efforts for the record. Sales for Levee Town were minimal and it was several years before Landreth rekindled the momentum in his solo career. In 2002 Jimmy Buffett recorded the Levee Town track \\"The U.S.S. Zydecoldsmobile\\" on his Far Side of the World (album) and featured Landreth on the record. Over the next few years Landreth continued to build momentum with touring, a 2003 release of his own, guest appearances on albums with friends such as Little Feat, and Mark Knopfler, and a much touted 2007 appearance at Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival in Chicago. Landreth's 2008 album From the Reach was the first release on his own label, LandFall Records, and featured contributions from Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, Dr. John and Vince Gill among others. By 2009 Landreth was once again on firm footing and the idea for a re-release of Levee Town became a possibility. He had fortunately insisted on owning the rights to the master recordings in his original contract with Sugar Hill so in April 2009 Levee Town Expanded Edition with five additional tracks was released on LandFall Records. Reception was once again very positive, with most critics praising the work even more than in 2000. A 2005 commentary in The Nation magazine by journalist Alexander Cockburn on the difficulties and profiteering surrounding reconstruction of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina quotes the Sonny Landreth song \\"Levee Town\\" with the line \\"Don't be surprised at who shows up, down in the Levee Town.\\" Album cover Grammy nomination The cover for Levee Town features the design work of Megan Barra and the photography of Jack Spencer both longtime friends of Landreth‚Äôs. The cover and Megan Barra were nominated for the 2002 Grammy Award for Best Recording Package. Track listing #\\"Levee Town\\" - Sonny Landreth 6:28 #\\"This River\\" - Landreth 4:20 #\\"The U.S.S.

On October 22, 2008, IBM filed a complaint against Papermaster claiming breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets. They sought a preliminary injunction to prevent Papermaster from working at Apple, claiming his employment violated non-competition agreement.IBM v. Papermaster, No. 7:08-cv-09078, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95516 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 21, 2008). Case Background and hiring In October 2007, Apple started looking for a top-level executive to work under their Senior VP, iPod Division and eventually move into the Senior VP role, reporting directly to then CEO Steve Jobs. Although it interviewed him, Apple did not find Mark Papermaster to be the right fit at the time. In April 2008, Apple bought P.A. Semi, a microchip design company, with the intent of using the company's chips on Apple's iPods and iPhones.Brown, Erica. Apple Buys Chip Designer, Forbes (April 23, 2008). In the microprocessor industry, P.A. Semi and IBM were direct competitors. Five months later, after the release of new versions of the iPod and the iPhone, Apple picked up the search for a Senior VP, iPod/iPhone Division to replace Tony Fadell. Papermaster interviewed again in October, and Apple offered him the position on October 10, 2008. Papermaster accepted, told IBM he planned to accept on October 13, 2008, and notified them of acceptance on October 20, 2008. IBM offered Papermaster a raise if he agreed to stay or one year's salary if he delayed starting at Apple for one year. Papermaster declined the offer and submitted his formal resignation the next day. Restraining order IBM did not learn until the first hearing that Papermaster had already started working for Apple, and immediately filed for a restraining order to enjoin him from continuing to work. Judge Kenneth Karas of the United States District Court in the Southern District of New York heard the case and granted IBM's request. Before releasing the public opinion, Judge Karas ruled that IBM must pay a $3,000,000 bond to Papermaster for any costs or damages that Papermaster might incur, meanwhile still unable to work at Apple. Inevitable disclosure IBM argued that the appointment would cause it irreparable harm through inevitable disclosure and misappropriation of trade secrets. IBM claimed that because of the information Papermaster had access to, including trade secrets, there was \\"substantial risk of Mr. Papermaster disclosing this information to IBM's detriment\\" which would result in irreparable harm. They argued inevitable disclosure, stating that because of Papermaster's position and responsibilities at Apple it was inevitable for him to apply knowledge learned at IBM to his work at Apple, thus aiding a competitor and harming IBM. Papermaster claimed that he could recall only two inconsequential areas in which Apple was, and only temporarily, in direct competition with IBM. Industry analysis disagreed and found Apple and IBM to be direct competitors. Papermaster had signed the non-competition agreement which clearly stated that any breach of the agreement would cause irreparable harm. Judge Karas also found that, \\"Because Mr. Papermaster has been inculcated with some of IBM's most sensitive and guarded technical and strategic secrets, it is no great leap for the Court to find that Plaintiff has met its burden of showing likelihood of irreparable harm.\\" This is also despite an employment agreement Papermaster signed with Apple which stated explicitly that he would not disclose trade secrets from prior employers. Karas writes that the Court doesn't believe Papermaster would act \\"dishonorably\\" but that he couldn't help but inadvertently share some information that could be considered a trade secret.  Enforceability of non-competition agreement  The court also considered whether or not the non-competition agreement itself was reasonable and therefore enforceable. Karas found that, given IBM's international business, the geographic scope was necessary and the time restriction of one year was reasonable. Additionally, because of the similarity of the position at Apple to his work at IBM, the agreement was needed to prevent incidental misappropriation of IBM trade secrets. Critics believe the opinion could have repercussions such as \\"expanding inevitable disclosure doctrine\\" to the detriment of anybody attempting to further their career in a particular field by moving to another company in the same industry.Altieri, Peter and David Clark, A New Byte of the \\"Inevitable Disclosure\\" Apple, EBG Trade Secrets & Noncompete Blog (February 12, 2009). In considering whether or not the non- compete clause caused undue hardship to Papermaster, the Court weighed the agreement with IBM against the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of the SVP position. Judge Karas concluded that, since intellectual property is IBM's most valued asset, the cost of trade secret disclosure to IBM outweighed the cost to Papermaster in delaying the opportunity. The case was set to go to trial. Settlement On 27 January 2009 it was announced that Papermaster's lawsuit with IBM had been settled and that he'd take over Senior Vice President of Devices Hardware Engineering at Apple on 24 April 2009, replacing Tony Fadell, who stepped down some months earlier. The settlement requires that Papermaster make two scheduled court certifications ‚Äì the first having occurred on July 2009 and another in October 2009 ‚Äì to testify that he will protect IBM trade secrets. Apple and IBM reached a settlement, where \\"Papermaster could only work for Apple after a six month unpaid vacation.\\"  See also  * Wallace v. International Business Machines Corp. et al.

He worked with others in 20th-century theoretical physics and mathematics such as J. Robert Oppenheimer and John von Neumann, and was acquainted with Albert Einstein. Early years Nussbaum was born to a Jewish family in Rheydt, a borough of the German city M√∂nchengladbach in northwestern Germany, in 1925. The youngest of three children, he was a Holocaust survivor and was orphaned after the Nazi takeover of Germany. Both his father, Karl Nussbaum, a wounded veteran of World War I during which he had been awarded the Iron Cross, and his mother, Franziska, died at Auschwitz. His brother, Erwin Nussbaum, was also captured and killed. Nussbaum and his sister, Lieselotte, were separated and sent on a Kindertransport ¬∑to Belgium in 1939. When Belgium was invaded by Germany, Nussbaum escaped to southern France, then under the Vichy regime. He lived there at an orphanage known as Ch√¢teau de la Hille. He began his teaching career there, while still a teenager, teaching mathematics to the younger children. After being captured twice, and jailed once by the Nazis, he escaped on foot to Switzerland, where he attended the University of Zurich, WUSTL flag at half-staff in honor of A. Edward Nussbaum, retrieved November 8, 2009 studying both mathematics and physics. In 1947, he was sponsored by relatives in New Jersey to emigrate to the United States. Career Shortly after emigrating to the United States, he studied mathematics at Brooklyn College before transferring to Columbia University in New York where he earned his master of arts degree in 1950 and his Ph.D. in 1957. While writing his thesis for Columbia, he worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton with John von Neumann, a mathematician who used Hilbert spaces in his development of the mathematical basis of quantum mechanics. Hilbert spaces eventually became Nussbaum's area of expertise and he wrote several papers with von Neumann on this topic. During this period, Nussbaum also became acquainted with Albert Einstein, another of the original group at the Institute for Advanced Study. Nussbaum's thesis was accepted with no revisions and he received his doctorate shortly thereafter. In the meantime he had worked at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, where he co-authored papers with Allen Devinatz, and at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. He followed Devinatz to St. Louis to teach at Washington University in 1958. In 1962, he was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Studies working with Robert Oppenheimer; in 1967-68 he was a visiting scholar at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. He joined Washington University's mathematics faculty as an assistant professor in 1958. He became a full professor in 1966 and taught until 1995, when he was named an emeritus professor. Personal life Nussbaum married his cousin's sister-in-law, Anne Ebbin, on September 1, 1957. They had a son, Karl Erich Nussbaum and a daughter, Franziska Suzanne Nussbaum.

He is a professor emeritus of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, known for his work on non-linear optics. He was born in Shanghai and graduated from National Taiwan University. He received his Ph.D. in Applied Physics from Harvard under physicist and Nobel Laureate Nicolaas Bloembergen in 1963, and joined the department of physics at Berkeley in 1964. In the early years, Shen was probably best known for his work on self-focusing and filament propagation of laser beams in materials. These fundamental studies enabled the creation of ultrafast supercontinuum light sources. In the 1970s and 1980s, he collaborated with Yuan T. Lee on the study of multiphoton dissociation of molecular clusters. The molecular-beam photofragmentation translational spectroscopy that they developed has clarified much of the initial confusion concerning the dynamics of infrared multiphoton dissociation processes.Multi-Photon Dissociation of Polyatomic-Molecules.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Shen developed various nonlinear optics methods for the study of material surfaces and interfaces. Among these techniques, second-harmonic generation and sum frequency generation spectroscopy are best known and now widely used by scientists from various fields. He has collaborated with Gabor Somorjai on the use of the technique of Sum Frequency Generation Spectroscopy to study catalyst surfaces.

James Earl Danieley (July 28, 1924 ‚Äì November 29, 2016) was the sixth president of Elon College (1957‚Äì1973), a private college in Elon, North Carolina and has contributed over 60 years of service to the school. Early life Danieley grew up in Alamance County, North Carolina. He attended Elon College for his undergraduate education from 1941 to 1946. He then received his graduate degrees in organic chemistry from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and conducted post-doctoral research at Johns Hopkins University. Elon University Website Career Danieley was first offered a job as freshman chemistry teacher at Elon College which he gladly accepted. Danieley noted, ‚ÄúThere was no question. I loved being at Elon. It was a no- brainer, you don't even have to think about that. I just came right on back.\\" Longo, Michelle.\\"Danieley fathers Elon sports traditions\\" The Pendulum, 2008-09-10, Retrieved on 2009-11-01. Danieley served as Dean of the college from 1953 to 1956. On July 1, 1957 the Board of Trustees elected Danieley the sixth president of Elon College, succeeding Leon Edgar Smith who served from 1931 to 1957. Accomplishments During his tenure as president of Elon College, one of Danieley's biggest impacts was in athletics. He was known for his innovative ideas in athletics and played a major role in the expansion of women's athletics at Elon College. In 1972, Danieley hired a high school coach from Gibsonville, North Carolina, Kay Yow, to coach the first women's basketball team at Elon. Yow also helped to organize both the first volleyball and softball teams at Elon. Yow became the all-time leader in winning percentage at Elon in both women's basketball and volleyball. Before passing away due to cancer, Yow served as the head coach of the women's basketball team at North Carolina State University. Danieley created a solid foundation for soccer, cross country, and every women's sport. Danieley made the College Board's SAT test a requirement for admission. He also expanded the library, built seven new buildings on campus and admitted Elon's first black students. In 1972 he completed a 3 million dollar fund drive, and implemented Elon's 4-1-4 semester system which still runs today.Keller, George. \\"Transforming a College: The Story of a Little Known College's Strategic Climb to National Distinction\\", pp. 5‚Äì6, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, Maryland. Danieley left the presidency post in 1973 to return to his roots as a chemistry teacher at Elon. Awards Danieley has been the Thomas E. Powell Jr. Professor of Chemistry since 1982. Danieley was elected to the University of North Carolina Board of Governors in 1983 and served for 12 years. In 1992, Danieley was named president emeritus and remains only one of two presidents in Elon's history along with Leon Edgar Smith (1931‚Äì1957) to have received that honor.

The all-metal wing was cantilever, stressed to +6/-6 g and featured full-span reflexing ailerons that could be raised to increase cruise performance, as well as winglets. The wing centre was covered with aircraft fabric. The cockpit included a windshield, with the sides left open, although a full enclosure was intended to be optional.

He was beatified as a martyr by Pope John Paul II on 27 September 1992.Beatifications during Pope John Paul II's Pontificate Life Collins was born in 1566 of a prominent merchant family in Youghal, County Cork, in the Kingdom of Ireland,Forristal p.5 His father and brother both served as mayors of the town. In 1586 he went to Nantes, France, where he worked for three years as a servant in various hostelries in Brittany, to acquire a horse and to join the cavalry. In 1589 he joined the forces of the Catholic League led by Philippe Emmanuel, Duke of Merc≈ìur, at war against the Huguenots of Brittany. He was soon promoted to the rank of captain (under the name of La Branche), and was appointed military governor of territory taken from the Huguenots.\\"Dominic Collins\\", Living Space, the Irish Jesuits Collins went to Spain with a letter of recommendation for King Philip II, whose service he entered. He transferred to the Spanish army and was stationed in the garrison at La Coru√±a.Duffy, Patrick. \\"Blessed Dominic Collins\\", Caitlicigh Ar An Ngreasan After nine years of military service, he decided to leave the army, and was granted a pension of 25 escudos a month by King Philip.Timoney S.J., Senan. \\"Decisions, decisions: Blessed Collins SJ\\", Catholic Ireland During the Lent of 1598, Collins met an Irish Jesuit priest, Thomas White from Clonmel, who had founded the Irish College at Salamanca. Collins expressed a desire to become a Jesuit and White introduced him to the superiors of the college. Although he was now 32 years old, the Jesuit provincial thought it was wise to delay his entrance, perhaps to test the strength of his vocation. There were doubts too about his being sufficiently educated to become a priest but he was willing to be a Jesuit lay brother. He entered the Jesuit novitiate in Santiago de Compostela in December 1598. When the Jesuit College was struck by a plague, Dominic tended the victims, nursing some of them back to health and comforting the others in their last hours. A report from that time describes him as a man of sound judgement and great physical strength; mature, prudent and sociable, though inclined to be hot-tempered and obstinate. He was allowed to profess religious vows in the Society in February 1601. Soon after his profession, an expedition was organised by King Philip III of Spain to assist Hugh O'Neill and Red Hugh O'Donnell in their attempt at revolt against English rule. James Archer, an Irish Jesuit priest assigned by the king as chaplain to army requested that Collins be assigned as his companion and assistant, due to his extensive military background. The fleet set sail on 3 September 1601 in two squadrons. The smaller part of the fleet, to which Collins was assigned, ran into bad weather and was delayed, eventually reaching Castlehaven in southwestern Cork on 1 December, the main squadron having reached Kinsale more than two months earlier. After the disastrous Battle of Kinsale (24 December 1601), Archer returned to Spain to seek help. Collins remained behind at Dunboy Castle to attend to the spiritual needs of 143 Irish soldiers who were besieged by 4,000 English troops. Dunboy fell into the hands of the English on 18 June 1602.Forrestal, p. 21 While the others were immediately hanged, the Jesuit and two other survivors were held prisoner. They were then taken to Cork where they were tortured, and the two surviving Irish soldiers soon executed. Relishing the prospect of having a Jesuit abjure his faith in his very hometown, the English took Collins to Youghal, a distance of 173 km. There, he addressed the crowd in Spanish, Irish and English, cheerfully telling them that he had come to Ireland to defend the Catholic faith, for which he was happy to die. So moved was the crowd that the hangman fled and a passing fisherman was forced to do the job. Without any formal trial, he was condemned to death and hanged on 31 October 1602.Forrestal p. 24  Beatification  Collins was beatified ‚Äì along with Francis Taylor and 13 other Irish martyrs ‚Äì on 27 September 1992 by Pope John-Paul II.Church of the Irish Martyrs Liturgically his feast is celebrated on 20 June, or 30 October (in the Society of Jesus).

The road is mostly straight, running in a north- south orientation throughout its length. It began at the hamlet of Glenarm and travels to Uphill. The road was constructed in the 1850s as the Victoria Colonization Road in an effort to settle the southern fringe of the Canadian Shield. The northern half was designated as Secondary Highway 505 until 1998, when it became part of Kawartha Lakes Road 35\\\\.  Route description  Kawartha Lakes Road 35 is a straight road, and only deviates north of the Head River. The road runs in a predominantly north-south direction and covers a distance of . The road crosses primarily rural geography, with the exception of the three unincorporated communities: Glenarm, Victoria Road and Uphill. The route begins in the hamlet of Glenarm at an intersection with Kawartha Lakes Road 8 (Glenarm Road) and runs between farms for most of its length; the occasional forest breaks the farmland. The road crosses the Trent-Severn Waterway and intersects Kawartha Lakes Road 48 (formerly Highway 48). The road north of this point was known as Highway 505 until January 1, 1998, when it was downloaded to Victoria County and was numbered as County Road 35\\\\. This was changed to Kawartha Lakes Road 35 on January 1, 2001, when Victoria County became the city of Kawartha Lakes. The road continues to the village of Victoria Road. North of this point, the road is on a lower maintenance priority, and pavement conditions quickly deteriorate. It continues until reaching the Digby-Laxton Boundary Road. The highway descends into the Head River valley, crosses the river and begins to wind through thick coniferous forest. As it rises out of the valley, now in the Canadian Shield, the route becomes very narrow and features several blind turns before ending in Uphill at Kawartha Lakes Road 45.  History  North of the Head River, Kawartha Lakes 35 enters the Canadian Shield. During the early-1800s, the government of Upper Canada, a majority of which is now Ontario, appropriated settlers to various lots which had been surveyed along the lake shores of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. The townships established along these fronts contained generally fertile land composed of glacial till and clay-rich loam. As these townships filled up, business opportunities presented themselves for investors to purchase native lands and open them to settlement. The Canada Company was the most successful of these ventures, and attracted settlers to vast areas of land in Western Ontario by building routes such as the Huron Road and the Toronto‚ÄìSydenham Road during the 1830s and 1840s. As these areas too filled, the government came under pressure to open up the unforgiving terrain of the Canadian Shield to settlement, and sought to establish a network of east‚Äìwest and north‚Äìsouth roads between the Ottawa Valley and Georgian Bay. This area was known as the Ottawa‚ÄìHuron Tract. In 1847, an exploration survey was carried out by Robert Bell to lay out the lines that would become the Opeongo Road, Hastings Road and Addington Road. The Public Lands Act, passed in 1853, permitted the granting of land to settlers who were at least 18. Those settlers who cleared at least within four years, built a house within a year and resided on the grant for at least five years would receive the title to that land. The government subsequently built over of roads over the following 20 years to provide access to these grants. However, the promises of fertile land in this new northern tract of wilderness proved false. Beneath thin layers of sparsely spread soil was solid granite. Where this granite descended deeper, valleys formed and filled with muskeg. Despite an early influx of settlers, the vast majority of grants were abandoned by the turn of the century; only 40% remained. During the first half of the 1900s, many of these colonization roads were incorporated into the growing provincial highway network. Some sections were improved to modern highway standards, while others were subsequently bypassed or abandoned. The roads that were not incorporated as highways either became local roads or were consumed by nature. The Victoria Road is one of several such colonization roads built in the 1850s to promote settlement in what was then the frontier of Ontario. The road continued north of its current terminus in Uphill into what is now the Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands Provincial Park. It then followed the Black River north-east to the Peterson Road in Vankoughnet; this part of the road fell into disuse by the turn of the century. In 1956, the Department of Highways assumed a portion of the Victoria Road between what was then Highway 46 (Highway 48 between 1975 and 1998) and Highway 503 was designated as Secondary Highway 505. It retained this designation and remained unchanged until January 1, 1998, when the entire route was designated as Victoria County Road 35\\\\. Victoria County was restructured as the city Kawartha Lakes on January 1, 2001, which resulted in the road being renamed Kawartha Lakes Road 35.

Cast * Ralph Lynn - David Blake * Winifred Shotter - Peggy Croft * Davy Burnaby - Sir Charles Croft * Robertson Hare - Trigg * Vera Pearce - Lady Croft * Frederick Burtwell - Stromboli * Phyllis Clare - Babs Critical reception In 1933, the Melbourne Argus wrote, \\"one has become accustomed to seeing Ralph Lvnn as Ralph Lynn in every part which he plays. His appearances in the opening sequences of Just My Luck (at the Majestic) as a music teacher who expects everyone to kick him down the back stairs raises hopes that at last one is to see him subordinate himself to a character. The hopes are refreshing but fragile, like a glass of iced lager in the tropics - not that it matters much. Ralph Lynn as Ralph Lynn is as diverting a spectacle as the British screen can offer. The attitude to life of Mr. Blake, the music master, Is expounded in a single phrase. \\"I wonder why that didn't hit me,\\" he ponders when a loose slate slides from a rooftop and shatters at his feet. Poor Mr. Blake has had 35 years of bad luck...Mr. Lynn contrives to leaven his foolery with touches of genuine pathos, but when his luck changes to prove the comforting theory that a man has as much good as bad fortune in his life, he fairly romps in his Rookery Nook style, through broader and yet broader farce. It is all very good fun, though.

The goal of the game is identical to that of its similarly named predecessor, Connect Four. Players take turns placing game pieces in the grid-like, vertically suspended playing field until one player has four of his or her color lined up horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Unlike its predecessor, Connect 4x4 uses a double grid, two different types of game pieces, and can be played by up to four people at once. Playing the game Before the game begins, each player chooses a set of checkers (brightly colored disks) and sets them aside. The game pieces come in two forms: regular checkers with holes in the center of them and \\"blockers\\" which are two discs joined in the center by a small bar. The gameboard is seven spaces wide, six spaces high, and two spaces deep and sits upright so that pieces can be dropped through openings in the top. As each player takes a turn, he or she chooses which type of checker to use and places it in the opening at the top. The game piece will then slide straight down until it reaches the first unoccupied space within that column. Strategy During each move, a player decides at what location to place a checker. Each choice should be based on trying to line up one's own checkers while at the same time trying to prevent opponents from lining up their checkers first. Along with regular checkers that take up a single slot on either side of the double grid, each player has two blockers which take up both sides at once. Because the blocker is connected by a rigid bar, it will stop at the higher open slot between the two sides. This can potentially take multiple slots of a single column on one side of the board out of play for all players even though they remain unoccupied by game pieces. Winning the game The game is won by the first player who lines up four of his or her checkers in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Checkers can weave back and forth between the two grids as well which increases the number of ways to place four in a row.YouTube: Connect 4x4 Double Grid Edition commercial See also * Qubic * Score Four * List of abstract strategy games Notes External links * Category:Board games introduced in 2009 Category:Milton Bradley Company games Category:Children's board games Category:Abstract strategy games Category:Tic-tac-toe ","title":"Connect 4x4"},{"id":"25014378","text":"The Union of Young Fascists ‚Äî Vanguard (, Soyuz Yunykh Fashistov ‚Äî Avangard) was a boy's youth organization of the Russian Fascist Party.

Hokky in the later part of his life) (1888, in Szepsi, Aba√∫j-Torna County, Kingdom of Hungary ‚Äì 1971, in Cleveland), was a politician and educator, who due to changing political circumstances, could be defined early on as being a Hungarian, then as an ethnic Hungarian in Czechoslovakia, and later as a Hungarian-American; throughout the transitions though he kept a strong Hungarian political and cultural identity. Early life and education Hokky was born in what was Szepsi, in the Aba√∫j-Torna County of the Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Moldava nad Bodvou in Slovakia) (another version places his birthplace at Abaujszepesi, Hungary). He attended both Budapest University and Kolozsv√°r University (now Babe≈ü-Bolyai University at Cluj-Napoca, Romania). He was a school teacher in Budapest and later in Kassa. Military career With the outbreak of the First World War he was drafted and served as infantry officer in the 34th Reserve, on the Russian Front. After being wounded he was given non-combat occupation duties. After the war he returned to Ko≈°ice, but after the Czechoslovak Legions took over the city in 1919 he, like other Hungarian teachers, was dismissed from work. His writings about this period, even after many decades, show considerable bitterness towards the Czechoslovaks. Political career In 1921 he had a major role in founding the Christian Social Party of Carpathian Ruthenia and became its Secretary General. In 1928 he was elected as a Representative, and one year later as member of the National Assembly in Prague. In 1935 he was elected as a Czechoslovak Senator for a term which was to last until 1939. However, with the First Vienna Award he was deprived of his mandate, as his constituency was no longer part of Czechoslovakia. After the Hungarian army occupied Carpathian Ruthenia, the newly created Hungarian National Council invited him to serve as Member of Hungarian Parliament instead. On 1944 he fled before the advancing Soviet troops, as did many ethnic Hungarians in Carpathian Ruthenia. Eventually he reached the United States, where he spent the rest of his life, involved in Hungarian anti-Communist emigre circles. Archive Hokky's papers in Hungarian and English for the 1954‚Äì1970 period, including correspondence (especially with Maria Ugron Podhorszky) and writings are deposited in the Hungarian American Collection, Immigration History Research Center, University of Minnesota () (note: biography on this site wrongly attributes his military service to World War II rather than World War I).

It is often toasted or broiled, and there are variations made with chocolate and, in a 1959 recipe, orange juice in the dough and icing. Coconut doughnuts are not usually filled, but there is an unrelated coconut doughnut that uses a coconut cream filling (like a Boston cream doughnut or jelly doughnuts). History A 1946 recipe in the Chicago Tribune suggested coconut or chopped nuts as a doughnut topping.\\"Coconut or doughnuts: Frost lightly with vanilla flavored confectioners' sugar icing and sprinkle with coconut or chopped nuts.\\" During a 1964 discussion of doughnut popularity and innovation (such as drive thru stores, the doughnut hole, and a handle to aid coffee dipping) advertising director Carl Zucher of the Mr. Donut company said a customer at a Florida drive-in feeds them to his horse, and especially the toasted coconut variety was the horse's favorite. Recognition Andy Ward calls Dunkin' Donuts' toasted coconut variety \\"the greatest doughnut of them all\\" in an Esquire article.

A coconut doughnut that is a \\"girly shade of pink\\" is a featured product of \\"cult\\" doughnut shop Top Pot Doughnuts in Seattle, Washington. It was one of the varieties included in a 2005 distribution agreement with Starbucks stores in Western Washington. Conan O'Brien praised a coconut doughnut with a coconut cream filling as a \\"life-altering experience\\" during a three-day visit to Toronto in 2004, saying \\"it blew my mind\\". Controversy A mouse was photographed eating a coconut doughnut in the window of a franchised Dunkin' Donuts outlet (Riese Organization's) in Midtown Manhattan in 1998, as part of a front page story of The New York Post. It was noted in a lawsuit where Dunkin' Donuts tried to oust the franchisee.

He played as a midfielder for NK Zagreb and as a forward for SK Sturm Graz during a career spanning from 1971 to 1986. Club career NK Zagreb Bakota started his career with NK Zagreb and played there for the first nine seasons of his career, at a time when the club was struggling to establish themselves as a stable top flight side. At the beginning of his career, he participated in one of the most notable matches NK Zagreb ever played. It was a second leg of qualifying match between NK Zagreb and NK Osijek for entering the first league. The first one in Osijek ended 0‚Äì0. Match, known as \\"Great drama in Maksimir\\", took place on 19 July 1973 at Maksimir stadium because of great demand for tickets. The attendance was 64.138 which broke the stadium record and stands to this day. He came in the game later on as a substitute for another notable NK Zagreb player, ≈Ωeljko Smolek. NK Zagreb eventually won the match, after a penalty shoot-out (4‚Äì3) which allowed them to play in season 1973‚Äì74 with the best clubs in top division. He stayed with the club after they were relegated from first division at the end of the 1973‚Äì74 season, and helped them return to top division the following years. In season 1974‚Äì75, which was the best season from Bakota in Zagreb jersey as he scored 11 goals in 34 appearances NK Zagreb finished second in Group West of Yugoslav Second League behind Borac from Banja Luka with no promotion to top division. Next season, NK Zagreb finally achieved promotion to first division by winning the Group West of Yugoslav Second League. Bakota scored 6 goals in 17 appearances. His second best season with NK Zagreb was 1977‚Äì78 when he scored 10 goals in 28 appearances, playing as their starting line-up midfielder. However, in 1979 they were relegated again. Sturm Graz After staying at the club for one more season, Bakota decided to re-join his former manager Otto Bariƒá at Austrian side SK Sturm Graz in 1980. He flourished there, forming an attacking partnership with Gernot Jurtin, and helping the club finish as league runners-up in the 1980‚Äì81 season, as well as becoming the league's top scorer in the 1981‚Äì82 season with 24 goals in 36 appearances. In European competitions, his greatest achievement was reaching the 1983‚Äì84 UEFA Cup quarter-finals with Sturm, before they were knocked out by England's Nottingham Forest 1‚Äì2 on aggregate. Bakota retired in 1986, having scored a total of 86 goals in 167 Austrian Bundesliga appearances for Sturm. His retirement was short lived as he played at the regional levels with FC F√ºrstenfeld, and SV Wildon. In 1988, he played abroad in the National Soccer League with Toronto Croatia. International career His good games at NK Zagreb were also noticed by the national team manager Dra≈æan Jerkoviƒá who called him up to the national side in 1978. Bakota debuted and earned his single national cap on 15 November 1978, in a Balkan Cup 4‚Äì1 win against Greece held in Skopje (in a match which saw Vahid Halilhod≈æiƒá scoring a hat- trick). Personal life Bakota from Graz to Buzin There are many sad stories in football. Bo≈æo Bakota, a former footballer of NK Zagreb, left a very deep mark in the Sturm Graz. He was a popular football player in that part of Austria. In the center of Graz he held a hugely popular Cafe \\"7\\". He owned gas stations, but the troubles clung to them. He lived in Buzin, a village near Zagreb, where he originated. He died on 1 October 2015.

At the time, it was the largest and most comprehensive study of high school students ever conducted in the United States. Designed by American Institutes for Research founder John C. Flanagan, Project Talent was intended as ‚Äúthe first scientifically planned national inventory of human talents.‚Äù(1962). Education: Talent Census. Time Magazine, 80. http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,896531,00.html Students from 1,353 schools across the country participated in two full to four days of testing. Fifty years later, the data is still widely used in multiple fields of study and follow-up studies are underway with original participants.  Origins and Historical Context  The study was developed by American Institutes for Research, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research institute, and several other organizations, including the University of Pittsburgh, through a Cooperative Agreement. It was funded by the United States Office of Education. It began as a national survey of the aptitudes and abilities of American youth.Flanagan, J.C. (1972). The Project Talent Data Bank: A Handbook. Palo Alto, CA: American Institutes for Research in the Behavioral Sciences. http://www.eric.ed.gov:80/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/37/71/17.pdf High school students in 1,350 schools across the country were administered an extensive and rigorous series of questionnaires that assessed cognitive skills, collected demographic information, and surveyed their personal experiences, extracurricular interests, and goals for the future. At 1, 5, and 11 years after projected high school graduation, participants were asked to complete additional mail questionnaires that focused on their work and personal life.Wise, L. L., McLaughlin, D. H., & Gilmartin, K. J. (1977). The American citizen: 11 years after high school, Vol. II. Palo Alto, CA: American Institutes for Research. In 2009, the American Institutes for Research began preparations for additional follow-up studies. Over the past 50 years, researchers have utilized Project Talent data for studies in economics, sociology, psychology, psychometrics, history, health, education, and many other fields. Project Talent‚Äôs combination of aptitude, cognitive, social, psychological, and health measures make it a unique data source for lifecourse studies. The study is also of particular interest as a profile of a generation that came of age at a time of unprecedented cultural, social, and technological change. In an interview with Time magazine in 1962, Dr. Flanagan explained his conviction that many Americans were entering professions to which they were unsuited. He described Project Talent as a mechanism for identifying individuals‚Äô strengths and steering them on to paths where those strengths would be utilized. He based his work on his experiences during World War II, when he headed a United States Army Air Corps aviation psychology program that sought to identify those who would excel at training and become able combat pilots. Rather than making military assignments based solely on educational attainment or general IQ, he designed and administered exams to match raw abilities to particular skill sets. Regarding Project Talent, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson wrote to Dr. Flanagan that ‚Äúit would be difficult to think of a more worthwhile undertaking than your efforts to assure that the best use is made of our nation‚Äôs most valuable resource.‚ÄùShaycoft, M. (1977). Project Talent: A Short History of a L-O-N-G Project. Palo Alto, CA: American Institutes for Research.  Study Design  Over 1,350 public, private, and parochial schools were chosen to participate in Project Talent based on their geographic location, school size, and student retention rate. With the exception of New York City and Chicago schools, where a random sample of approximately 1 in 10 students participated, every student in grades 9‚Äì12 in a participating school took the Project Talent tests. Ultimately, Project Talent included roughly 5 percent of all the high school students in the U.S. in 1960.Flanagan, J.C. (1960). Designing the Study. Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh.  The base-year tests  Project Talent included standard aptitude tests (e.g., vocabulary and arithmetic) and subject tests (e.g., English and the sciences). It also measured students‚Äô personality attributes (e.g., sociability and calmness) and innate capabilities (e.g., memory skills, creativity, and spatial and abstract reasoning). Students provided detailed information regarding their health status, family background, extracurricular activities, and plans for the future.Flanagan, J.C. (1972). The Project Talent Data Bank: A Handbook. Palo Alto, CA: American Institutes for Research in the Behavioral Sciences. http://www.eric.ed.gov:80/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/37/71/17.pdf The results offered a glimpse look into the experiences and aspirations of American adolescents in 1960.  The Follow-ups  Mail surveys were administered to each of the grade cohorts in the 1960 sample at 1, 5, and 11 years after their expected high school graduation. While each of the follow-up surveys differed slightly, they all collected information on participants‚Äô postsecondary education, labor force participation and plans, family formation, military service, health behaviors, and life satisfaction.Wise, L. L., McLaughlin, D. H., & Gilmartin, K. J. (1977). The American citizen: 11 years after high school, Vol. II. Palo Alto, CA: American Institutes for Research. After the mid-1970s, name and address changes hindered participant tracking efforts and the project fell into a 30-year hiatus.  Select Findings  Project Talent data from the base-year and follow-up studies highlight the dramatic and long-term effects of individual personality, family background, and early life experiences. Across the country, students‚Äô performance on the aptitude tests demonstrated the necessity of more individualized instruction in the classroom and more personalized career and college guidance.Flanagan, J.

More recently, Project Talent data has been used to study long-term changes in the American education system, work force, and family structure.Kuhn, P., & Weinberger C. J. (2005). Leadership skills and wages. Journal of Labor Economics, 23(3), 395-436. Data from the study has been used in more than 400 analyses and publications across a variety of disciplines. Upon completion of current and future follow-up activities, the Project Talent dataset will both complement and extend current research endeavors on aging and the life course and will be comparable with aging datasets such as Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) (1992 ‚Äì present) and the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (1957 ‚Äì present). Project Talent can be also compared with similar data sets, such as the National Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 and the National Survey of Young Women and Mature Women.  Current Activities  The Project Talent Twin and Sibling Study: In 2014 a follow-up survey began with the some 5,000 twins and their siblings that participated in the original study.The Project Talent Twin and Sibling Study, American Institutes for Research http://www.projecttalent.org/twinsib Nearly 95% of these participants were located, despite not having been in contact with them for nearly 50 years. There are several other large twin studies in the U.S., but Project Talent is the only one that began with a representative sample. It includes males and females from a wide range of ethnic and racial backgrounds from across the U.S. It is the only twin study that includes siblings of twins and other siblings from the same communities. 65% responded to the new survey and the data is currently being analyzed. Large-Scale Followup Study: Beginning in 2009, the American Institutes for Research, with support from the National Institute on Aging, began preparations for a large-scale follow-up study. The American Institutes for Research launched a major effort to relocate participants and reconstruct the data from earlier waves into more modern file formats. In 2011, AIR partnered with the University of Michigan to conduct a pilot follow-up study. Slightly fewer than 4,000 participants‚Äîapproximately 1 percent of the original sample‚Äîreceived a survey regarding their career, family, and health. The study‚Äôs high response rates confirmed the feasibility of locating and surveying participants after an extended hiatus. Analysis of the pilot study is still underway and findings are forthcoming. Additional follow-up studies currently under development seek to examine the how the behaviors, abilities, and interests demonstrated early in life impact the well-being of individuals as they age.Stone, C. & Bandyk, J. (2012, May). All participants being unequal: A bias analysis of three contemporary strategies for locating longitudinal study participants after an extended hiatus.

It is found in Eurasia and North America, as well as southwest Western Australia. Unlike the related Lobster mushroom, H. lactifluorum, the bolete eater and its afflicted host mushrooms are inedible. Taxonomy Hypomyces chrysospermus was first described by French mycologists, brothers Louis Ren√© and Charles Tulasne in 1860. Common names include bolete eater, and bolete mould. The bolete eater belongs to a genus of parasitic ascomycetes, each of which infects differing genera of fungi. For example, H. lactifluorum attacks mushrooms of the family Russulaceae, H. copletus and H. transformans infect Suillus species, H. melanocarpus prefers Tylopilus species, while other Hypomyces have a much broader host range. Description Ascus and spores The bolete eater infects boletes, initially with a thin whitish layer which then becomes golden and finally a reddish- brown pimpled appearance. The bolete's flesh softens and is putrescent by the third stage. Single or multiple boletes may be infected, members of Paxillus and Rhizopogon are also attacked. The spores are oval-shaped and smooth in the white stage and measure 10‚Äì30 by 5‚Äì12 Œºm, and are warty, round and thicker- walled in the yellow stage and are 10‚Äì25 Œºm in diameter. These two stages are asexual, while the final stage is sexual; here the spores are spindle-shaped and measure 25‚Äì30 by 5‚Äì6 Œºm. Distribution and habitat Hypomyces chrysospermus is found in North America, and Europe, where it is common. It is common in the southwest of Western Australia, where it is found in forest and coastal plant communities. It is also found in the Eastern Chinese provinces of Hebei, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Fujian. Usage As mentioned earlier, H. chrysospermus is not edible and may be poisonous. The bolete eater is used in Chinese herbal medicine to stop and heal external bleeding, primarily through application of the spore onto open wounds or cuts.

His major areas of research included the history of geometry in antiquity and Lobachevskian geometry. Mikhail Vaschenko-Zakharchenko was married on Vera Nikolayevna Vaschenko-Zakharchenko (n√©e Mel'nickaya), the founder of the First Private Kiev Gymnasium for women. Biography Vaschenko-Zakharchenko was born in noble family of Ukrainian descent. He studied in Zolotonosha uyezd college and the 2nd Kiev Gymnasium. His mathematical education he received partially in the Kiev University, partially in Paris. Since 1867 ‚Äî a professor of the Kiev University. From the start of 1870s Vaschenko-Zakharchenko began to read the course of the projection geometry, and from 1878 ‚Äî the course of non-Euclidean geometry (basics of the Lobachevsky geometry). In 1880 he published the translation of Beginnings of Euclid with a big introduction where were viewed the main principles of the hyperbolic geometry. In 1871, Mikhail Vaschenko-Zakharchenko married Vera Nikolayevna Mel'nickaya (1840‚Äî1895) from Tver noble family. Vera Vaschenko-Zakharchenko has founded in Kiev the first private Gymnasium for women. Scientific works In 1862, for the first time systematically gave a lecture on the operational calculation and applied it to solve the differential equations. In 1866, he defended his doctor dissertation Riemann's theory of compound variable functions. That was one of the first works in the Imperial Russia in that field. Vaschenko-Zakharchenko is also known for working in the history of mathematics. He is an author of more than dozen textbooks on the analytical geometry, projection geometry, algebra, calculus of variations, and including an important work on the history of mathematics in which he discussed the history of mathematics up to the 15th century. He worked on the theories of linear differential equations, probability and non- Euclidean geometry.

In 2007 treatment was initiated in the health zone of Kasongo, in 2008 it was initiated in the health zones of Kunda, Lusangi, Salamabila and Samba,UFAR Concludes Initial Treatment, United Front Against Riverblindness news release and in 2009 it was initiated in the remaining health zones of Kabambare, Kampene and Pangi.UFAR Announces Plans to Treat Nearly One Million Since the community-wide mass treatment of all eligible people must be repeated once a year for 10‚Äì15 years, approximately three million tablets of Mectizan (ivermectin) were distributed in 2009 in all eight health zones by some 4,540 trained community workers. Governance UFAR is governed by a volunteer board of directors that oversees the organization's activities and promotes its objectives and goals. The board is chaired by Jeffrey Yuan, PhD. The board includes members from medicine, academia and industry and includes: Daniel L. Shungu, PhD (Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases), Roger Youmans, MD (Associate Executive Director, Surgeon & General Practitioner, Former Medical Missionary to DRC and Ghana, Author), Dr. Dennis Bowers (CEO of Life Force Technologies, Inc.), Mrs. Jean Jacobsohn (UFAR Treasurer), Dr. John McGlaughlin (Mathematics Instructor - Philadelphia School District), Dr. Elsie McKee (Church History, Historical Theology - Princeton Theological Seminary), Mr. Charles C. Phillips (Past- Chair, Information Technology, Resource Development, Isles, Inc.), Dr. Robin Rusciano (Political Science, Current Social World Issues - Rider University), Robert J. Vosatka, MD, Ph.D (Board Chair Emeritus, Physician, Teacher, Scientist), Jeffrey Yuan, PhD (Board Chair, Pharmaceutical Regulatory Affairs Scientist, Merck & Co., Inc.) An advisory council includes private-sector professionals who lend their expertise in support of the United Front Against Riverblindness organization. Executive Director Dr. Daniel Shungu manages the day-to-day operations and works with the field staff as well as APOC,Global Partnership to Eradicate Riverblindness WHO, the DRC Ministry of Health and other local and international public and private organizations that share in the mission of eradicating onchocerciasis. Health program  Disease eradication measures  Onchocerciasis is a neglected tropical disease.Neglected Tropical Diseases The primary strategy to control onchocerciasis is to interrupt the life cycle of the parasite.Water Related Diseases Ivermectin, known by its trade name Mectizan, is the only drug available for treating onchocerciasis without severe side effects. The drug rapidly kills microfilariae (immature worms) but not the adult worms. A single oral dose of ivermectin, taken annually for the 10-15 year life span of the adult worms, protects individuals from further progression of onchocerciasis. Merck & Co. manufactures the drug and provides it freeDonation Program worldwide for the treatment of onchocerciasis. Onchocerciasis is a parasitic disease transmitted through the bite of the small black fly that breeds along the banks of fast-flowing rivers. People acquire the disease during their regular trips to infested rivers for their routine daily activities such as farming, hunting, fishing and fetching water. Larvae, transmitted to humans through the bite of the small black fly, mature under the skin into adult worms forming visible nodules throughout the body. Pairs of adult worms produce millions of microfilariae during their entire 10-15 year life span. The microfilariae initially cause a rash, severe itching, thickening and depigmentation of the skin, followed by visual impairment and eventually blindness. Implementing disease control and treatment measures Annual treatment requires annual training of community distributors (one distributor per 100-200 people), and requires that trained local medical staff be on hand during the annual treatment phase for handling any treatment-related severe adverse reactions. Eight health zones and 116 health centers comprise the CDTI Kasongo region. The people are served by three hospitals and there are 136 medical doctors and nurses in the region. More than 1,700 villages, ranging in size from 100 to more than 65,000 people, are included in the CDTI Kasongo. Training community workers The Community Directed Treatment with Ivermectin (CDTI) program is the strategy whereby people in endemic communities are empowered to play a major role in managing their own health. CDTI has been adopted worldwide as the primary method for mass distribution of Mectizan to control onchocerciasis. UFAR works with these adult volunteers in partnership with APOC, the World Health Organization, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo national government. Communities choose their own community distributors.Setting up CDTI programs These village-based volunteers serve as health care workers who are trained to take full control of the ivermectin treatment program in their respective communities. The training includes providing accurate basic information on the disease and the drug in the local languages, instructions on taking the census, ordering and collecting ivermectin from the health center, preparing and conducting community-wide distribution of the drug, submitting treatment reports back to the health center, and monitoring and reporting any unusual adverse reactions. Such active community involvement greatly improves both the therapeutic and the geographic coverage of ivermectin mass distribution programs. Health education activities Effective treatment includes more than distribution of medicine. It also requires education to address long-held myths about the causes of onchocerciasis. This educational process begins with enlisting the cooperation and participation of the village chief and tribal elders. New initiatives The United Front Against Riverblindness (UFAR) announces a landmark partnership with Sightsavers, an international development charity. Sightsavers will fund riverblindness prevention and elimination in two remote areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). More than 1.2 million people and 2,728 villages will be added to UFAR's existing program. Dr. Daniel Shungu, founder of UFAR, says that UFAR will now be able to bring lifesaving medicine to Ituri Nord and Lubutu, in Oriental and Maniema provinces, respectively. \\"I thank Sightsavers on behalf of UFAR and especially for those in the two new regions whose lives will be positively changed forever as a result of this arrangement. We have a few more challenges to face but, fortunately, finances for these two projects will not be one of them,\\" he says.

Lynch, 491 F. Supp. 381 (D.R.I. 1980), was a decision in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island that upheld the right of a gay student to bring a same-sex date to a high school dance. The Court ruled that existing free speech doctrine protected gay and lesbian students' rights to attend their proms with same-sex dates of their choice. The case was \\"one of the first successful victories in the courtroom for an LGBT issue involving young people, and is routinely cited each year in numerous cases surrounding the rights of students to bring same-sex dates to school functions.\\" Background In April 1979, a gay high school junior named Paul Guilbert sought his principal's permission to bring a male date, Ed Miskevich, a senior at Brown University, to his junior prom at Cumberland High School in Rhode Island. The principal, Richard Lynch, \\"denied the request, fearing that student reaction could lead to a disruption at the dance and possibly to physical harm to Guilbert.\\" The Cumberland School Department denied a public hearing to Paul Guilbert because his father opposed his plan to attend with a male date.Arizona Gay News: \\"Father, school say boy can't take a male date to the prom,\\" April 20, 1979 , accessed March 26, 2012 Guilbert and Miskevich did not attend the prom. The next year, Guilbert's friend Aaron Fricke, who was also a gay student at Cumberland High School, again asked Lynch for permission to bring a same-sex date to a school dance. Lynch denied the request in a letter to Fricke citing the \\"real and present threat of physical harm to [Fricke], [his] male escort and to others.\\" Lynch also wrote that \\"the adverse effect among [Fricke's] classmates, other students, the School and the Town of Cumberland, which is certain to follow approval of such a request for overt homosexual interaction (male or female) at a class function\\" was sufficient ground for rejecting the request. Fricke, represented by John Ward of Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, seeking a preliminary injunction that would allow him to attend the dance. Decision The Court, accepting Fricke's freedom of speech claim, decided that \\"even a legitimate interest in school discipline does not outweigh a student's right to peacefully express his views in an appropriate time, place, and manner.\\" The Court wrote that threats of physical violence against Fricke and his date gave homophobic students an unconstitutional \\"heckler's veto\\" that would allow \\"them to decide through prohibited and violent methods what speech will be heard.\\" The judge ruled that the precedent of United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 88 S. Ct. 1673, 20 L. Ed. 2d 672 (1968), was the appropriate framework for judging the constitutionality of Lynch's decision. O'Brien required that the government and its agents pursue the \\"least restrictive alternative\\" before making any decision to limit free speech. The judge ruled that Lynch's decision failed to meet the requirement of O'Brien because the school could have taken \\"appropriate security measures to control the risk of harm\\" and the principal had not made \\"any effort to determine the need for and logistics of additional security.\\" The judge ruled that \\"the First Amendment requires that such steps\\" be taken to investigate and implement security measures. The Court found the free speech claim to be dispositive and did not address Fricke's free association and equal protection arguments. With the respect to equal protection arguments, the court noted that \\"the school [had] afforded disparate treatment to a certain class of students\\" by setting up different policies for those who wished to bring same-sex partners to the dance and those who wanted to bring different-sex partners. Such a policy, the Court said, could be \\"profitably analyzed under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\" Aftermath On May 31, 1980, the press reports said that \\"Amid heavy security, homosexual student Aaron Fricke showed up at the senior prom with a male companion. Both wore tuxedos.\\" Lynch addressed the senior class earlier in the day and promised to respond to any harassment of the couple with \\"very stern measures.\\" The school provided six rather than the customary two police officers for security. Some students taunted the couple when they danced together.Google News: \\"Six police protect homosexual, date at school's prom,\\" May 31, 1980, accessed March 26, 2012 Following Fricke, American public high schools have increasingly allowed gay and lesbian students to attend school functions with their same-sex partners. In 2004, Murray High School in Utah prohibited same-sex students from participating in the promenade of their prom. Press coverage noted the similarity to Fricke's case.Detroit News: Deb Price, \\"Utah student reinforces gay youth rights,\\" April 30, 2004 , accessed March 26, 2012 Using Fricke as a precedent, the ACLU threatened to sue the high school on behalf of its gay and lesbian students.

He served in World War I, and was decorated with the Croix de Guerre and the Legion d'honneur. With Lysiane Rey, he was the father of Patrick Pr√©jean, and grandfather of Laura Pr√©jean. Biography Pr√©jean shot his first five films with French director Henri Diamant-Berger between 1921 and 1923. The roles he played tended to embody the leading man for the people, generous and strong. His most lasting fame stems from his work in the films of Ren√© Clair that transition from the silent to the sound eras. These include most notably the farce Un Chapeau de Paille d'Italie (1928) and the musicalized melancomic Sous les toits de Paris (1930). When German director G. W. Pabst directed the film version of the huge Brecht-Weill musical hit Die Dreigroschenoper in 1931, he simultaneously shot a French-language version (L'op√©ra de quat'sous) with a French lead cast. Pr√©jean was given the coveted lead role of the underworld kingpin Mackie Messer. In 1929 he directed a medium-length film L'Aventure de Luna-Park with Daniele Parola. In addition to acting he was also a popular singer in the 1930s. He sang songs like \\"La Valse to Dede Montmartre\\". During World War II he continued to act in films. In March 1942, he joined a group of actors who at the invitation of the Germans visited film studios in Berlin. This was alongside French actors and actresses such as Ren√© Dary, Astor Junie, Viviane Romance, Suzy Delair and Danielle Darrieux. He recollected his memories in a book published in 1979 with the help of his son, voice actor Patrick Pr√©jean.

Howard, 367 Ark. 55, 238 S.W.3d 1 (2006), is a decision by the Arkansas Supreme Court in which the court unanimously overturned a state policy banning gay adults and their housemates from being foster parents. Background In 1999 the Arkansas Child Welfare Agency Review Board established a policy that \\"no person may serve as a foster parent if any adult member of that person's household is a homosexual.\\"\\"Easy Cases, Bad Law\\", April 21, 2005. The ACLU then sued the board in the Circuit Court of Pulaski County on behalf of William Wagner, Matthew Lee Howard, and Anne Shelley‚Äîthree adults who wanted to serve as foster parents but were rejected under the policy.\\"Advocacy & Issues\\" , 2009. Howard was a teacher who was already raising two children with his same-sex partner of nineteen years, Shelley was a lesbian who wanted to serve as a foster parent, and Wagner was a married heterosexual whose gay son sometimes lived at his home.\\"Howard v. Arkansas - Case Background\\", October 4, 2004. Decision After hearing extensive evidence and expert testimony about the scientific research on lesbian and gay parents, the circuit court found that the board had no factual support for its belief that gay people were less fit to be foster parents. In particular, the court found that the facts demonstrate that there is no correlation between the health, welfare, and safety of foster children and the blanket exclusion of any individual who is a homosexual or who lives in a household with a homosexual.\\"\\"Howard v. Arkansas\\", June 29, 2006. The court also found that the policy may have hurt children by \\"excluding a pool of effective foster parents\\"; children raised by gay parents are not more likely to have \\"psychological, behavioral, or academic\\" problems; and that there is \\"no factual basis for saying that heterosexual parents might be better able to guide children through adolescence than gay parents.\\" The circuit court ruled against the board, and the board appealed from that decision to the Arkansas Supreme Court. The supreme court upheld the circuit court's decision because, without any factual basis for the board's policy, the board had usurped the legislature's role and had attempted to enforce a standard of morality.\\" The board's policy therefore violated the separation of powers. And, \\"[b]ecause the Board acted outside the scope of its authority and infringed upon a legislative function,\\" the supreme court could not say that the circuit court was in error. Aftermath In 2007 the Arkansas House Judiciary Committee voted to reject SB 959, \\"a bill that would have banned gay people and most unmarried heterosexual couples who live together from adopting or serving as foster parents.\\"\\"ACLU Applauds Defeat of Anti-Gay Adoption and Foster Care Bill; Calls Defeat a Tremendous Victory for Arkansas Children\\", March 27, 2007. The bill would have been an end-run on the Supreme Court decision in Howard, as it would have had the same effect while side-stepping the separation of powers problem. In November 2008, voters approved Arkansas Proposed Initiative Act No. 1, which banned anyone living with a partner he or she isn't married to from adopting or providing a foster home to minors. The ACLU filed suit in state court on behalf of several Arkansas families challenging Act 1 as unconstitutional. The Arkansas Supreme Court struck down Act 1 on April 7, 2011.Ark.

Battle With the help of artillery and explosives the Polish army managed to destroy some parts of the wall. Jan Sobieski personally led the troops during the storming of the town. The Poles entered the town, but blundered into an ambush and came under heavy artillery and musket fire. Having lost about 4,000 men, including 200 officers, the Polish army was forced to retreat. Duke Antoine III de Gramont, who at that time was an officer in the army of John II Casimir, reported that the small Russian garrison showed miraculous bravery and excellent artillery skills. Eight days later the King ordered a repeat of the storming. The Polish army once again managed to penetrate the fortress, but the counter-attack of the garrison drove the attackers out of it. De Gramont describes the storming as almost successful but once again expresses his surprise how the Russians recaptured the openings in the walls and how efficiently they fired back in spite of heavy Polish artillery fire aimed at them. The Polish army again experienced heavy losses. Meanwhile, Prince Romodanovsky arrived at Hlukhiv with his army of 45,000 Russian soldiers and Cossacks. Simultaneously, many Left-bank Ukraine cities, which had previously surrendered without fighting, rebelled against the Polish occupation. The rebellions also spread into Right- bank Ukraine. Wishing to avoid a great battle, Jan II Casimir lifted the siege. Polish retreat Pursued by the Russian forces, the Polish army retreated to Novhorod-Siverskyi. During the retreat, the Poles executed Ivan Bohun, who was suspected of handing over important information to the Hlukhiv garrison. The defence of Hlukhiv ruined the Polish plans of bringing Left-bank Ukraine back under the control of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. In the following years, Poland was afflicted with internal conflicts (Lubomirski's Rokosz) and active fighting on the Polish‚ÄìRussian front came to an end. Finally, the Treaty of Andrusovo was signed in 1667, formally ending the armed conflict.

He was confronted by the Liverpool players angrily protesting that Arsenal's first goal, a header by Alan Smith, should have been disallowed. Hutchinson consulted with his linesman to confirm he had made the correct decision in awarding the goal. The linesman confirmed this and thus the goals stood. Hutchinson commented that he couldn't understand why the Liverpool players were protesting nor why their protests were so strong. Liverpool player Ray Houghton later admitted that none of the Liverpool players really knew what they were protesting about and they were just taken aback that they had conceded the goal.

He demonstrated moderate abilities as a combat commander; his real strength lay in his organizational and logistical talents. He held several posts as chief-of-staff and in military administration. He joined the military in 1791, as a private in the French Revolutionary Army; from September 1791 to September 1793, he was promoted from lieutenant to brigadier general. He and his commanding officer were accused of being counter-revolutionaries, disgraced, and then, in 1794, restored to rank. In 1804, Napoleon I appointed him as governor general of the French colony in Saint-Domingue and Guadeloupe, following the suppression of a widespread slave insurrection. Although he was able to reestablish some semblance of order and agricultural production, the British overwhelmed the colony in 1810 and, after a brief engagement, forced him to capitulate. He returned to France on a prisoner exchange, but was charged with treason by Napoleon I, enraged by the loss of the colony to the British. Before he could be exonerated by a court, the First Empire fell; with the Bourbon Restoration, he retained his honors, and received command of the III Corps, in Marseille. After the second restoration, he held an administrative position in one of the occupation zones, and later he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies of France. Military career After completing school, Ernouf received entered military service as a private in the Revolutionary army. He was commissioned as a lieutenant of infantry in the 1st Battalion of Volunteers of the Orne on the 24 September 1791, and as a captain on 22 March 1792, and 5 May 1793 he became an aide-de-camp of General Barthel's Army of the North. On 30 July 1793, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel.Charles Mulli√©. \\"Jean Ernouf\\". Biographie des c√©l√©brit√©s militaires des arm√©es de terre et de mer de 1789 √† 1850. Paris (?): Poignavant et Compagnie, 1852. Initial successes in the Lowlands and the lower Rhine In 1793, during the War of the First Coalition, Ernouf was sent to Cassel to strengthen the French position. The Duke of York laid siege to Dunkirk and blockaded the town of Bergues, on the Belgian border, which had insufficient garrison to fend off the British. Ernouf assembled a force of a thousand men and joined Jean Nicolas Houchard; together they marched to the relief of Dunkirk. Once there, he led a column in attack on the British camp. On 5 compl√©mentaire an I (21 September 1793), which would have been the last day of the first year of the new Republic, he was raised to the rank of Brigadier General and was appointed on 9 vend√©miaire an II (30 September 1793) as chief of staff to the Army of the North.Mulli√©, \\"Jean Ernouf\\". It was also by his advice that the commander-in-chief, Jean- Baptiste Jourdan, discovered Josias, Prince of Coburg's unfortunate position behind the Wattignies forest, compelled him to retreat across the Sambre and subsequently lifted the siege of Maubeuge: Ernouf's part in this action, the Battle of Hondschoote, earned him his promotion to Major General on 23 frimaire an II (13 December 1793). When Jourdan did not order an aggressive pursuit, both he and Ernouf were recalled by the Committee of Public Safety in disgrace. He was suspended on suspicion of being a counter-revolutionary, but reinstated upon the end of the Reign of Terror in 1795. Upon his reinstatement, he was appointed Chief of Staff of the Army of the Moselle and the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse. He held several administrative posts, including a stint in which he helped to develop the topographical and geographical military maps. Action in Swabia and Switzerland In 1798, Jourdan appointed him as chief of staff for the Army of Observation. Ernouf was with the Army of Observation when it crossed the Rhine river, in what British historians have called a violation of the Treaty of Campo Formio,Ramsey Weston Phipps. The Armies of the First French Republic, volume 5: The armies of the Rhine in Switzerland, Holland, Italy, Egypt and the coup d'√©tat of Brumaire, 1797‚Äì1799.

On 2 March, the Army was renamed Army of the Danube, and it marched to Upper Swabia, where it engaged Archduke Charles' Habsburg force at Ostrach on 21 March, and again on 25 March at Stockach.Timothy Blanning. The French Revolutionary Wars, New York, Oxford University Press, pp. 41‚Äì59. In both battles, the Habsburg manpower, superior to the French numbers by three to one and two to one respectively, overwhelmed the French lines; Jourdan, the commander of the Army, was unable to concentrate his forces sufficiently to counteract the Habsburg numbers, and withdrew to the Black Forest in late March.Theodore Ayrault Dodge, Napoleon: A History of the Art of War. vol. 3, Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co, 1904, pp. 581‚Äì582. Ernouf took command of the Army of the Danube while Jourdan returned to Paris to request more troops.Jean-Baptiste Jourdan. A Memoir of the operations of the army of the Danube under the command of General Jourdan, taken from the manuscripts of that officer, London: Debrett, 1799, p. 204. He was replaced as commander of the Army of the Danube by Andr√© Mass√©na, and served as Massena's chief of staff in the Swiss campaign of 1799, during which he saw action in Zurich and central Switzerland; he was again at Zurich for the French victory over Alexander Rimsky-Korsakov.Digby Smith.

Shortly afterward, he was sent to Guadeloupe and Saint-Domingue as Captain General of the colony, to restore order in the wake of the slave and mulatto rebellion against slavery and the Saint-Domingue campaign of Charles Victor Emmanuel Leclerc.Mulli√©, \\"Jean Ernouf\\"; The Louverture Project.\\"Leclerc\\". Within a year, after burning former slaves who refused to go back to the plantations plantations, Ernouf had restored slavery and agricultural production. From his base on Guadeloupe, he dealt generously with many of the refugee planters who escaped the previous years' carnage. He also took over the Swedish island of St. Barts, where the rebels of St. Domingo had taken refuge, and from which they coordinated privateering 80 million francs. There is some evidence to suggest that he either actively encouraged, or at least permitted, the earlier practice of privateering against British and American shipping; British officers later found open commissions, signed by Ernouf, which suggested he was granting commissions to pirates for \\"services\\" rendered.Roy and Lesley Adkins. War for all the Oceans. New York: Penguin, 2008, p. 327. Four privateer ships sailing from Guadeloupe between 1805 and 1810 bore the name G√©n√©ral Ernouf, one of which was the captured sloop-of-war HMS Lilly), which underscores his encouragement of privateering. His task was further complicated by the failure of the Treaty of Amiens and the outbreak of war with Britain. To protect Guadeloupe, he established coastal batteries. The British capture of Martinique in 1809 marked a critical point for the French on Guadeloupe; blockaded on all sides by the naval forces of the British, the French civilians and soldiers were reduced to near starvation. In January 1810, the British initiated an invasion of Guadeloupe; Sir Alexander Cochrane's naval force landed 11,000 British troops under the command of Lieutenant General George Beckwith landed at Capesterre, or the eastern side of the islands.Adkins, p. 327. Attacked on three sides at the end of January 1810, Ernouff's force mounted a spirited, although short defense and capitulated on 6 February 1810, after which he was transported to Britain. He was repatriated to France in a prisoner exchange in 1811. Irritated at the loss of Guadeloupe to the British, Napoleon accused him of abuse of power, embezzlement, and treason. Ernouf spent 23 months in captivity in France while the courts debated how to proceed. Restoration At the Bourbon Restoration, Louis XVIII suspended the proceedings against him for lack of evidence and Ernouf entered into Bourbon service. He was created Chevalier of Saint-Louis, on 20 August of that year, and he was appointed Inspector General of Infantry. On 3 January 1815, he went in that capacity in Marseille. In March 1815, he received a command in the 1st Corps, under the general command of Charles, Duke of Angoul√™me. Napoleon's return Ernouf was on an inspection away from this command when Napoleon landed at Cannes. Upon his landing, many of the soldiers of Angoul√™me's army flocked to Bonaparte's banner, beginning the Hundred Days. The mere news of Napoleon's escape from Elba and the defection of some of the troops caused Charles, Duke of Angoul√™me, to panic and capitulate. Ernouf returned to Marseille, where he learned that Andr√© Mass√©na also had chosen the imperial cause, after which he left for Paris. Napoleon rescinded Ernouf's honors and titles, and dismissed him from his post in the military on 15 April 1815. After Napoleon's final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, the second restoration of the Bourbons that summer also restored Ernouf's rights and property. Later years The Order of St. Louis, from the Bourbon Restoration. On 3 May 1816, Louis XVIII granted him the title of Baron with the Commander's Cross of the Order of Saint Louis, which entitled him to wear a red sash (right shoulder to left hip); he automatically received a pension, and hereditary nobility was granted to the son and grandson of knights. On 11 November 1816, Enrouf received command of the III Division, located at Metz, which was occupied by Allied troops as a condition of the Second Treaty of Paris; his role was to maintain harmony between residents and the foreign soldiers. Elected by the Moselle, in 1816, he obtained in 1818 permission to sit in the Chamber of Deputies, and left the command of the III Division when he became eligible for retirement on 22 July 1822. He died in Paris on 12 September 1827. Family Ernouf was married to Genevi√®ve Miloent (d. 22 November 1822).Etat civil reconstitu√© 1798‚Äì1860: Mariages, naissances, d√©c√®s.

It incorporates the tower of All Hallows Lombard Street and is prominently south of a major road of west London, near Twickenham Stadium, specifically the Chertsey Road (A316). The church took many structures of Sir Christopher Wren's All Hallows Lombard Street in the City of London which was demolished in 1937 -- its stone square tower, bells, stone pillared cloister and many interior fittings and furnishings were moved to the site. History and description ;Former Mission In community the church began as the continuation of St Martin's Mission Church, technically at first a chapel, which had stood for a few decades from 1914. Its building was at the south end of Whitton Road, beside Heatham House. It was demolished to host a beekeepers' association when the tower of Lombard Street was donated. St Martin's was a mission of the parish of St Mary the Virgin, Twickenham. In 1933, it gained its own priest in charge, Harold Schofield. Under his leadership the church gained its own parish and he was made vicar. ;Foundation of the church at Chertsey Road The new features of the church were designed by Robert Atkinson as a modern build based on Wren's uncompleted plans for All Hallows Lombard Street. The foundation stone was laid by the Bishop of London, Arthur Winnington-Ingram, on 11 July 1939, and the new church was consecrated on 9 November 1940 by his successor Geoffrey Fisher. During its consecration, air-raid precautions were in place and anti-aircraft gun fire could be heard in the distance, leading the Bishop to say, \\"churches are being destroyed by agencies more unnatural and vile than the Great Fire [which had all but destroyed a previous form of All Hallows Lombard Street]\\". The main body of the church is a brick-built basilica with a narthex leading through the cloister to the old tower to the north, and to St Martin's Chapel to the south. The Christopher Wren-designed tower houses a peal of ten bells, including some of those that were originally hung at St Dionis Backchurch, then at Lombard Street.All Hallows Twickenham: The All Hallows Bells Inside the tower a massive oak gateway is preserved; it had been placed at the Lombard Street entrance to the old church after the Great Fire of London, and is decorated with skulls and crossbones. Much of the church's carved woodwork resembles and is contemporary with the work of Grinling Gibbons, showing traces of his style. The great reredos is the best candidate for his work similar to his work at St Mary Abchurch. Its dimensions were included in Wren's plans, its carving original 17th-century work. The paintings are from its renovation in 1870. At the centre of the reredos is a carved, gilded pelican feeding her young from her own flesh (a traditional image of Christ who feeds his followers with himself in Communion). The main altar comes from the former local mission. The one from Lombard Street is in the Chapel at the south end of the narthex). Behind the choir stalls, which flank the chancel, are two wrought-iron sword rests for the ceremonial sword of the Lord Mayor of London. The wooden, carved, chalice-shaped pulpit with large sounding board comes from Lombard Street. The most famous regular preacher to have occupied it was John Wesley, who is recorded as preaching from it on 28 December 1789, and it is known to be where he preached his first ex tempore (off the cuff) sermon. The pews date from 1870. The baptismal font at the west doors comes from St Benet Gracechurch. Its marble base is decorated with carvings of cherubs, and its tall wooden cover is topped by the figure of Charity welcoming children. The church has an organ built by Renatus Harris in 1695, which is installed in the western gallery per Wren's plans for it, never before realised. Beneath are old churchwardens' box pews emblazoned with a lion/unicorn (the royal arms supporters). Activities Services are held every Sunday at 8.30 (Book of Common Prayer), at 10.00 parish communion and at 11.30 (especially for families with small children). Services are occasionally held on Sunday evenings at 18.30 (evensong). Daily prayers are said morning and evening and there is a said Eucharist every Wednesday at 9.30. The 1960s hall is used by the local community including Little Wren's nursery school.http://www.littlewrenstwickenham.co.uk Car park The car park has tens of spaces and is charged per space for Twickenham Rugby Stadium matches/events for maintenance-only funds.

Douglas (SP-313) was a United States Navy minesweeper in commission from 1917-1919. Otis W. Douglas was built as a commercial motor freight boat in 1912 by Jackson and Sharp at Wilmington, Delaware. The U.S. Navy purchased her from the Douglas Company of Reedville, Virginia on 7 April 1917 for World War I use. After conversion into a minesweeper, she was commissioned at Norfolk, Virginia on 10 August 1917 as USS Otis W. Douglas (SP-313), with Lieutenant Grant T. Stephansen in command. Immediately after commissioning, Otis W. Douglas departed Norfolk for Brest, France, where she assumed minesweeping duties around Belle √éle and the entrance to Loire River. Her efforts aided in keeping convoy routes clear for the safe passage of troop ships and supply vessels. Continuing these efforts until the spring of 1919, Otis W. Douglas worked until the last mines were destroyed. Otis W. Douglas departed Brest for the United States with minesweeper and other vessels on 27 April 1919. Although weather conditions appeared favorable, a storm developed shortly after their departure. The ships headed back toward Brest, but in the heavy seas, Otis W.

As an administrative division, it is very new, having only been formed on November 1, 2009, from the former boroughs of La Cit√© and Limoilou.  Districts  The borough is composed of nine districts, six formerly part of La Cit√© and three formerly part of Limoilou: ;La Cit√© *Vieux-Qu√©bec‚ÄìCap- Blanc‚Äìcolline Parlementaire *Saint-Roch *Saint-Jean-Baptiste *Montcalm *Saint- Sauveur *Saint-Sacrement ;Limoilou *Vieux-Limoilou *Lairet *Maizerets  La Cit√©  La Cit√© (\\"the city\\" or \\"the stronghold\\") is the historic heart of Quebec City. It was the entirety of the city until the nineteenth century expansions and amalgamations. The former borough was divided into six different districts before the 2009 reorganization. The central district of La Cit√© is Vieux-Qu√©bec‚ÄîCap-Blanc‚Äîcolline Parlementaire. It is in turn centred on the old walled city, Old Quebec, and also includes nearby Parliament Hill, the Old Port, and the Petit Champlain shopping district. Other districts within La Cit√© are also home to much historic architecture and many important institutions. Limoilou 3rd Avenue, at the corner of 12th Street Limoilou is a former borough of Quebec City. Population (2001): 44,980. It consisted of the neighbourhoods of Vieux-Limoilou, Lairet and Maizerets. It is bordered by the borough of Beauport in the northeast, by the borough of Charlesbourg in the northwest, by the borough of Les Rivi√®res in the southwest, and by the former downtown borough of La Cit√© (now also part of La Cit√©-Limoilou) in the south. In terms of architecture, Limoilou is second only to La Cit√© as Quebec City's oldest neighbourhood. It is also Quebec City's second most densely populated borough, with 4,656 inhabitants/km2. A defining characteristic of the neighbourhood is its grid pattern layout, and the numerical naming of its streets, such as 11th Street and 3rd Avenue. History The first recorded instance of the name \\"Limoilou\\" to designate this former municipality occurred in 1893.Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec It is a variant of the word Limo√´lou, the name of 16th century French explorer Jacques Cartier's manor in Saint-Malo, Brittany, France.Mus√©e Jacques-Cartier Up until the end of the 19th century, the territory of Limoilou was entirely rural. First the settlements of Stadacona and Hedleyville appeared along the shore of the Saint-Charles River. Originally a separate municipality, it was incorporated into Quebec City in 1909 with which came larger, more urban projects.

While the Bay Model is still operational, it is no longer used for scientific research but is instead open to the public alongside educational exhibits about Bay hydrology. The model is located in the Bay Model Visitor Center at 2100 Bridgeway Blvd. in Sausalito, California. History In the late 1940s, John Reber proposed to build two large dams in the San Francisco Bay as a way to provide a more reliable freshwater supply to residents and farms and to connect local communities. In 1953, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed a detailed study of the so-called Reber Plan. Cornelius Biemond proposed a similar plan which would dam the Sacramento River in the delta region to feed aqueducts with freshwater. Authorized by Section 110 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1950, construction of the Bay Model was completed in 1957 to study the plans. The tests proved that the plan was not viable, and the Reber Plan was scuttled. The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta portion was added to the model in 1966-1969 to provide information for studies concerning impacts of the deepening of navigation channels, realignment of Delta channels (via the Peripheral Canal), and various flow arrangements on water quality. When completed, the expanded model covered of land. Size and scope The model is approximately 320 feet long in the north-south direction and about 400 feet long in the east-west direction. It is constructed out of 286 five-ton concrete slabs joined together like a jigsaw puzzle. Features that affect the water flow of the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta are reproduced, including ship channels, rivers, creeks, sloughs, the canals in the Delta, fills, major wharfs, piers, slips, dikes, bridges, and breakwaters. The limits of the model encompass the Pacific Ocean extending 17 miles beyond the Golden Gate, San Francisco Bay, San Pablo Bay, Suisun Bay and all of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to Verona, 17 miles north of Sacramento on the north, and to Vernalis, 32 miles south of Stockton on the San Joaquin River on the south. Scale The scale of the model is 1:1000 on the horizontal axis and 1:100 on the vertical axis. The model operates at a time scale of 1:100. The model is distorted by a factor of ten between the horizontal and vertical scales. The distortion is designed into the model to ensure a proper hydraulic flow over the tidal flats and shallows. The distortion does increase the hydraulic efficiency of the flows. These increased efficiencies are corrected by the use of copper strips throughout the model. The exact number of copper strips is adjusted during the calibration of the model.

The photographs are mostly portraits and depict persons infected with AIDS. Underneath each picture is a copy of a handwritten message by the subject, either telling an abbreviated version of the story of their illness or expressing thanks to the family and friends who have stood by them. An introduction of printed text analyzes the social issues discussed by the patients and highlights some of their more poetic lines.  Production  DIFFA (Design Industries Foundation for AIDS) granted Howard the money to complete the photographic element and printing of the book; although Howard holds the rights, all proceeds from the book's sale are returned to DIFFA. Howard collaborated with AIDS outreach agencies in order to meet and photograph People With AIDS (PWAs). The patients were mostly combed from clinics and services in Chicago, San Francisco, and Atlanta. After the photography was completed, each subject was asked to send a handwritten note to accompany their picture. In many cases the subject had already died by this time, and the note is written by his or her survivors.  Plot  Each page of the book can be viewed as an independent illness narrative. Howard, in letting his subjects speak for themselves, transcribes their stories in an intensely personal way. The photographs depict patients in their own surroundings, each one a visual narrative of the sick person's daily life. They use their own faces and bodies to convey the turmoil that lies within. Using photography as its principle medium, the book attempts to tell the story of AIDS from the patients' points of view. The introduction, by Lonnie D. Kliever, points out that many of the personal messages written by the portrait subjects indicate where they are on the journey toward accepting their mortality. Many other messages highlight illness as the main focus rather than impending death. A consensus among the patients is that dying from AIDS is bad, but living with AIDS is worse. Whether they last a few words or a long letter, each message represents that patient's personal story.  Themes  Religion/God: Many of the patients reference a spiritual connection to their religion being especially important after their diagnosis. Even though most acknowledge that they are homosexual, they cling to faith. In addition, one man brings up the idea held by some members of the religious community that AIDS is God's punishment to homosexuals. This man goes on to \\"pray that other AIDS patients will have a strong faith and belief in the forgiving goodness of the lord. He does not love us any less than before - so REJOICE! GOD LOVES YOU!\\" Discrimination: Even the most optimistic AIDS patients write in their messages about the ostracism they have encountered due to the public's prejudices about the disease. In the late 1980s, little was known about the virus other than it was a certain death sentence. Due to its association with sodomy and intravenous drug use, and its deadly nature, discrimination against those infected with AIDS was very commonThe AIDS war : propaganda, profiteering and genocide from the medical-industrial complex / John Lauritsen. Hysteria and rumors circulated, spreading paranoia throughout the country. Many patients claim to have been fired from their jobs or cut out of the lives of more conservative friends and relatives.Disease and Democracy : The State Faces AIDS in the Industrialized World Baldwin, Peter (Author) The partner of a man claimed by AIDS says that after his lover's death, he received some consolation and kindness from others \\"but not enough\\". This passage highlights the discrimination that gay men faced at this time, especially those affected by AIDS.Living well with HIV and AIDS [electronic resource] / Allen L. Gifford Cross-Cultural Issues: Another main point made by the AIDS patients is that although they encounter AIDS discrimination, AIDS itself does not discriminate.AIDS narratives : gender and sexuality, fiction and science / Steven F. Kruger. Most of the patients featured in Epitaphs are gay white males, but it also depicts women, babies,Children, adolescents & AIDS, edited by Jeffrey M. Seibert & Roberta A. Olson. and heterosexual males, in a range of races and socioeconomic backgrounds. Exhibition In 2012, portraits from the book were exhibited at Creativity and Crisis in Washington, DC. Most of the subjects had died by then. A portrait from the book of Tested Positive Awareness of Chicago at the Belmont Rocks, a gathering place for gays and lesbians in Chicago, appears in the closing montage of the film And the Band Played On.

He is known as a lateral thinker and is a SFEDI Gold qualified innovation consultant. Jeff Woolf OBE He was awarded an OBE by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace in 2001, for services to innovation and business. He is also a fellow of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce.  Biography  Woolf is the middle child with an older and younger sister. He was educated at Clifton College in Bristol. His late grandfather, Stanley Wagner, invented the Jif lemon and his late mother, Valerie, invented several interesting calendar and accounting systems. Woolf started his inventing career in 1979, working with white light holography. He attended the first world symposium on holography in 1980, in Boston and studied holography at the New York School of Holography. In the mid-1980s he worked with, Dan Wagner, at MAID (Market Analysis and Information Database). Woolf is a dyed- in-the-wool Arsenal fan.  Morpher  In 2011 Woolf noticed that by far the majority of cyclists on the London Barclays Cycle Hire scheme were riding without helmets. The scheme is also known as Boris Bikes as they were put in whilst Boris Johnson was London's Mayor. Woolf had a bad cycle accident some years before on the road in Hampstead, London and despite other injuries, firmly believes that a helmet saved his life. Woolf commissioned a survey to find out why helmets were not more widely used and most cyclists said that they didn't use one because they felt that they were too cumbersome to carry around all day. Woolf set out to see if he could overcome the problem by designing a helmet that could fold flat and therefore be more portable. Morpher was the result. Partially funded with crowdfunding from Indiegogo, Morpher's funding campaign was greatly oversubscribed, raising more than $250,000 against a target of $35,000. Morpher has been designed to surpass all relevant safety standards and is constructed of recyclable materials. Morpher is aimed at all cyclists but eventually Woolf plans to market it to other users of sports safety helmets (skiers, skaters, snow boarders, hockey players, horse riders etc.). Morpher has patent protection in many territories around the globe. Morpher is being produced in China and was first shipped to consumers in December 2015. Morpher raised further funds with two successful equity crowdfunding campaigns with Seedrs, firstly raising more than ¬£1m in 2016 Seedrs' first raise and almost ¬£4.5m with its second Seedrs campaign in 2019 Seedrs' second raise which resulted in a post raise valuation of more than ¬£20m. Morpher was one of Time Magazine's 25 best Inventions of 2016 Morpher was the recipient of Popular Science Magazine's Safety Invention of the Year 2014. This award was featured on CBS Morning Show Morpher also won the 2015 Edison Gold Award for Athletics and Recreation in New York City Morpher won the 2016 iF D&I; Design award at the Taipei Cycle Show In September 2020 Morpher ceased operations and some American Morpher Helmets were recalled by the CPSC. This recall only applied to helmets sold within the USA.  MicroMap  In 1993 he developed the MicroMap System and oversaw the design and manufacture of this invention. MicroMap was invented to overcome the problems associated with handling large paper maps outdoors, especially when exposed to the elements. It was first conceived as a piste map for use when skiing. It consisted of credit-card sized miniaturised maps which fitted into the MicroMap viewer and were held in a precisely curved plane. The viewer had a moveable lens system which re-enlarged the MicroMap cards, allowing a user to have a clear view of the miniaturised information. To save on assembly costs and handling difficulties, Woolf created an injection moulded lens that was moulded within its own hinged surround. This made assembly of the MicroMap viewer a far simpler process. He also developed systems to print miniaturised information onto credit cards at high resolutions of more than six million randomly placed and sized dots per square inch. MicroMap and Woolf were discussed during a debate on innovation in the House of Commons. During this debate, a MicroMap viewer was handed around for members of parliament to use. Woolf worked with Ron Hickman, inventor of the Black & Decker Workmate and designer of the Lotus Elan car, to some extent, benefiting from his patent experience before the final patent application was lodged. MicroMap was patented in many countries around the world. There is a display on the development of MicroMap in the Science Museum in London. MicroMap was featured in the Millennium Dome and was awarded Millennium product status. MicroMap cards were produced in conjunction with Ordnance Survey, the Automobile Association, USGS and Michelin. MicroMap was used by the SAS for bomb disposal and survival information.  Journalism  Woolf is a regular contributor to the media. He has had many prime time television, radio and webinar appearances where he has discussed his travels as well as matters relating to innovation and new product development. Woolf's article, 'Jamaica's Jewels' published in 2013 was nominated for 'Regional Publication Travel Feature of the Year' by McCluskey International on behalf of the Jamaican Tourist Board in the British Travel Press Awards. He is a member of the National Union of Journalists and the Chartered Institute of Journalists  Awards  Woolf has been the recipient of a large number of innovation / invention awards, including the Honeywell British Innovation Awards, Sunday Times British Invention of the Year, Carlton/NatWest British Enterprise Awards, Brussels Eureka, 50th Anniversary UNESCO Award for Innovation, Medaille du Minist√©re de l'Int√®rieur de France, 4 x Gold INPEX awards (USA), Ordnance Survey/British Cartographic Society Award for Mapping Innovation & Design, 1st World Innovation Olympics, Millennium Product Status Award, Lord Mayor of London's \\"Best of the Best\\" Award. He was also awarded the Gold award from the Worshipful Company of Tallow Chandlers. Woolf has recently been working on some new inventions, namely Stackbuster (working title) and Morpher (a folding bicycle helmet). These have both won significant awards in the UK and in Belgium. Stackbuster won the double gold prize and Morpher won the Platinum prize in the 2010 British Invention of the Year Awards in October. These two inventions also won Gold awards in the Brussels Eureka 2010 awards and Morpher was awarded a special award for best Transport product at Innova in November 2010.  Additional information  Woolf has been involved in many fields as an inventor since the early 1980s, including home security, payment systems and children's safety devices. He also has worked as a regular guest presenter on QVC, and has represented many well-known brands, including Canon, Sony, Panasonic, JVC, Samsung, Sharp, LG, Belkin, Lexmark, Elonex etc. He was chairman of the judging panel for the 2008 British Invention of the Year which was won by Bill Currie for his new riot shield design and was chairman of the judging panel for the World Innovation Awards in October 2009, 2010 and 2011 which were held at the British Innovation Show in London. He is also chairman of the judging panel for this year's (2012) World Innovation Awards, to be held at The Barbican in London in November. He was a judge on the Science Museum's Smart Toy Awards and was also one of three judges (the other two being Buzz Aldrin and Edward de Bono) at the Saatchi & Saatchi World Innovation Awards. Woolf spent much of the 1990s raising funds for his own companies. In 1998 he became responsible for running a ¬£300m private equity fund, locating investment opportunities. He has always been passionate about new technologies and has worked in the private sector as well as with the government in all sorts of innovation matters. He has spoken on innovation at Cambridge University, The Institute of Directors, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Procter and Gamble, The BBC, The British Library and many other venues and events. He currently works as the innovation specialist business advisor for Business Link in London and in this role he helps inventors and SMEs with innovation matters. He regularly holds innovation surgeries at the British Library in London.

During operations, special forces are led by the special operations division of the Bundeswehr Joint Operations Command (Einsatzf√ºhrungskommando der Bundeswehr) in Potsdam, which belongs to the Joint Support Service (Streitkr√§ftebasis). Beside KSK and KSM, there is a numerous of specialized units which are able to support special forces operations.  Special Forces   Army Special Forces  Most German special forces are part of the Kommando Spezialkr√§fte (KSK) which was founded in 1996. The KSK is a brigade level unit and stationed in Calw.

From 2015, the KSK gets its own aviation component made up of 15 EC645 T2 utility helicopters. They will be part of the Helicopter Wing 64 at the Holzdorf Air Base. The KSM is supported by the Naval Air Wing 5 in Nordholz which operates the Westland Lynx and Westland Sea King.  Specialized Forces   Special Operations Training Centre  Originally established in 1979 as an international school for long-range reconnaissance patrol team, the Ausbildungszentrum Spezielle Operationen is responsible for initial and further training of special and specialized forces. The centre has the size of a regiment, is subordinate to Army Training Commando and based in Pfullendorf.  Specialized Forces Army  In order to close the gap between the KSK and regular infantry, the German Army developed a concept of specialized forces (Specialized Forces of the Army with Expanded Basic Qualifications for Special Operations, EGB - Spezialierte Kr√§fte des Heeres mit erweiteter Grundgef√§higung f√ºr spezielle Operationen, EGB). This includes a numerous of army SOF units, mostly airborne forces. A distinction is made between the main operational forces and support forces. All of them are independent units respectively part of regular formations. In 2013, the operational forces consists of: * 4 x Fallschirmj√§ger Commando companies with each 4 platoons * 4 x Fallschirmj√§ger pathfinder platoons * 1 x Longe Range Reconnaissance Patrol Company * 2 x airborne engineer platoons * 2 x HUMINT HQ Squads * 4 x HUMINT Squads The support force are made up of: * 2 x airborne reconnaissance companies * 4 x K9 platoons of the Fallschirmj√§ger * 4 x Fallschirmj√§ger Joint Fire Support Coordination Teams * 4 x Fallschirmj√§ger Joint Fire Support Teams * 1 x electronic warfare platoon * several units, e.g. medics and PSYOPS  Fleet Protection Forces  From 1997 until spring 2014, both naval special forces (commando frogmen) and naval specialized forces (mine clearance divers and boarding trained naval infantry men) were organized into the Naval Specialized Deployment Forces, a battalion-sized unit with four companies. The ideas was to combine all specialized skills into one single formation. At the beginning, it was planned to create a force protection company beside the Boarding Company to support operations of the commando frogmen. Through the reorientation of the Bundeswehr, the commando frogmen got their own battaillon while naval infantry (including HUMINT experts) and mine clearance divers were summarized into the Naval Force Protection Battalion (Seebataillon) in Eckernf√∂rde. The formation is often described as the \\"multi tool of the German Navy\\". So, the battalion is able to support special forces operations.

Retrieved 2016-11-13 The Mars Exploration Joint Initiative (MEJI) is an agreement signed between United States' space agency, NASA, and Europe's space agency, ESA to join resources and expertise in order to continue the exploration of the planet Mars. The agreement was signed in Washington D.C. in October 2009, between NASA administrator Charles Bolden and ESA director- general Jean-Jacques Dordain. In its hey-day it resulted in a synergy between NASA Mars Science Orbiter and the Aurora ExoMars program, the combination of a flexible collaborative proposal within NASA and ESA to send a new orbiter- carrier to Mars in 2016 as part of the European-led ExoMars project.MEPAG Report to the Planetary Science Subcommittee Author: Jack Mustard, MEPAG Chair. July 9, 2009 (pp. 3) One of the goals was for NASA to provide to Atlas V launches for ExoMars, however in the early 2010s planetary exploration in the USA was not given enough money to fund this plan. Under the FY2013 budget President Barack Obama released on 13 February 2012, NASA terminated its participation in ExoMars due to budgetary cuts in order to pay for the cost overruns of the James Webb Space Telescope. With NASA's funding for this project cancelled, most of ExoMars' plans had to be restructured.  History  Discussions between NASA and ESA began in December 2008, driven by the ESA Ministerial Council's recommendation to seek international cooperation to complete the ExoMars mission and to prepare further Mars robotic exploration missions. At the same time, NASA was reassessing its Mars Exploration Program portfolio after the launch of its Mars Science Laboratory was delayed from 2009 to 2011. This provided NASA and ESA with an opportunity to increase cooperation and expand collective capabilities. The U.S. and Europe have taken the view that they can achieve more together scientifically at Mars if they combine their expertise. And with both parties' current Mars programmes also experiencing financial pressures, the shared approach means the exploration schedule of a mission every two years can be maintained. The executive board recommended NASA and ESA to establish MEJI, spanning launch opportunities in 2016, 2018 and 2020, with landers and orbiters conducting astrobiological, geological, geophysical and other high-priority investigations, and leading to the return of soil and rock samples from Mars in the 2020s. JWST survive a 2011 cancellation attempt, but is predicted to cost US$8.8 billion. Under the FY2013 Budget President Obama released on February 13, 2012, NASA was forced to pull out of joint Mars missions with Europe due to budgetary cuts, Aviation Week (February 14, 2012) in order to pay for the cost overruns of the James Webb Space Telescope. The proposal for the Financial Year 2013 reduced the planetary science budget from $1.5bn to $1.2bn; Although planetary science was a loser in general, Mars exploration was singled out for particular cuts, receiving $360.8m, which amounts to a reduction of almost 40% from the FY2012 estimate. The cuts may plunge the field into its biggest crisis since the 1980s and is considered likely to lead to the loss of up to 2,000 high-tech jobs. On February 29, 2012, the U.S. House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees NASA funding, rejected the space agency's request to begin shutting down its joint Mars-exploration effort with the European Space Agency, until the issue can be debated thoroughly. The committee believes that \\"so radical a change in policy needs and deserves to be fully considered by a process that is more rigorous and more inclusive than the reprogramming notification.\\" Regardless of the final outcome by the House Appropriations subcommittee, NASA will continue with its own Mars exploration projects: Mars Science Laboratory, MAVEN orbiter,Obama Wrecks the Mars Program (February 15, 2012) Mars 2020 rover, and InSight lander. Current status In April 2018, a letter of intent was signed by NASA and ESA that may provide a basis for a Mars sample- return mission. It is unclear if this is a new initiative or a restart of the original Mars Exploration Joint Initiative. The two agencies would need to draw up the mission architecture, and would be seeking commercial partners to collaborate on any sample-return mission.First Mars round-trip announced in hope for discovery of alien life. Henry Bodkin, The Telegraph. April 2018.  Missions  In its original version, the MEJI vision would have encompassed the following launch opportunities: *2016: A European-led orbiter (ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter), to study trace gases, including methane in Mars' atmosphere. The mission would also put a static meteorological station on the surface. Europe would handle the entry, descent and landing of this station - a capability it has yet to demonstrate. *2018: A European rover (ExoMars rover) would be dispatched to Mars. The U.S. would provide the entry, descent and landing system as being used by the Mars Science Laboratory. *2020: Under consideration is a network of very small landers focused on geophysics and the environment. *NASA would provide Atlas V launch rockets in 2016 and 2018 ExoMars missions. *The ultimate aim is a mission to return Mars rock and soils to Earth: the Mars sample return mission, some time in the 2020s.

Rodrigo V√©laz (died June 1144) was the \\"count of Galicia, who held Sarria\\" according to the near-contemporary Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris. During his long public career he was the dominant figure in mountainous eastern Galicia while the House of Traba dominated its western seaboard. He served under three monarchs‚ÄîAlfonso VI, Urraca, and Alfonso VII‚Äîand was loyal to all of them, never figuring in any rebellion. The contemporary Historia compostellana is a valuable source for his life, since there are no aristocratic archives surviving in Spain from this period. Rodrigo's career must be pieced together from the few references in the chronicles and the (copies of) charters preserved in various ecclesiastical archives.Barton (1997), 2. He was a son of Count Vela Ov√©quiz and Aldonza Mu√±oz, daughter of Count Mu√±o Fern√°ndez and Elvira.Barton (1997), 299. Rodrigo married Urraca √Ålvarez, daughter of √Ålvar F√°√±ez and Mayor P√©rez, a daughter of Pedro Ans√∫rez. Rodrigo and his wife were descended on all sides from the highest ranks of the nobility of Le√≥n and Castile. The couple had three daughters‚ÄîAldonza, Berenguela, and Elvira‚Äîand one son, √Ålvaro Rodr√≠guez, who was later a count like his father. On 6 August 1130 Rodrigo and Urraca made a donation to the Cathedral of Lugo, their first recorded act as husband and wife. Tenencias Rodrigo first appears as witness to a charter of 31 July 1092, in which his mother donated the monastery of San Pedro de Teverga to the cathedral of Oviedo. By late May 1112, he had received the rank of count. Shortly before, that same month, he had received the tenencia, that is, a fief of the crown governed but not owned by the holder, of Sarria. By 1 April 1115 he had also been invested with the tenencia of Monteforte de Lemos, and on 12 September 1118 he was cited as holding Caldelas (although this is the only reference to this tenencia in his hands). The region of Lemos and Sarria was usually governed by a count. It was bounded to the west by the river Minho and to the south by the Sil.Reilly (1982), 290. In 1120 a certain Pelayo Garciaz is recorded as merino serving both the queen and Rodrigo in Sarria.Reilly (1982), 308 n138: eiusdem regine et comitis roderici eo tempore maiorinus in sarria. By 7 September 1127 Rodrigo had also received the rule of R√°bade. The last record of his rule there dates from April 1142, although he continued to govern Sarria and Lemos until late September 1143. Royal documents usually refer to him as de or in Sarria (of or in Sarria), while private documents cite him as or tenente (tenant, holder). There is a sole private document from 1137 that refers to Rodrigo's rule in Lar√≠n.Reilly (1998), 179. There is no record of Rodrigo after 5 October 1143 and he had perhaps become too ill or too weak to take a part in public affairs. He was by that time quite old. His death is mentioned in a document of 22 June 1144 as having happened at that time.Barton (1997), 299 n1: in tempore morte comiti Roderico, et suo filio Alvaro Rodriguiz qui tenebat honore de Suprati. Relationship with the Crown In July 1114 Urraca went to Santiago de Compostela in an attempt to remove the bishop Diego Gelm√≠rez from power legally. Failing this she attempted to have him captured, which plan was spoiled by Pedro Fr√≥ilaz de Traba. She then opened negotiations with Diego, resulting in her swearing an oath to respect his person and his honor (the secular territory under the bishop's government). A similar oath was extracted from the other Galician magnates, including Pedro Fr√≥ilaz and Rodrigo V√©laz.Reilly (1982), 99. Rodrigo's loyalty to Urraca during the conflict-riddled part of her reign is demonstrated by the fact that he confirmed sixteen royal charters between 1112 and 1120, by far the most by any Galician magnate.Reilly (1982), 220. Rodrigo recognised the accession of Alfonso VII at Zamora, with the other magnates of Galicia, after the new king had taken the capital city of Le√≥n.CAI, I, ¬ß5. On 18 July 1126 Alfonso VII granted land at a place called Seixon to Pedro Ov√©quiz and his wife Mar√≠a Fern√°ndez through the intervention of Rodrigo. It is a good indicator of his influence at court.Barton (1997), 91. Military activities In the autumn of 1137, Rodrigo was one of only two Galician nobles to join the royal army then marching on Navarre. The other was Fernando P√©rez de Traba, who had joined the army by early October at Logro√±o. Rodrigo arrived later that month, only after the army had reached the Ebro river.Barton (1997), 179. In 1139 Rodrigo participated in the Siege of Oreja.Barton (2000). In 1140 Rodrigo allied himself with Fernando P√©rez de Traba, then the lover of Theresa, Countess of Portugal, which he de facto ruled as her consort. The two were defeated in battle near Cernesa, an unidentified location, by the forces of Theresa's son and heir, Afonso Henriques, who had grown uncomfortable with his mother's power-sharing, and had invaded Galicia, camping near Limia.Barton (1997), 174. The anonymous author of the Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris, perhaps Arnaldo of Astorga, attributes the counts' defeat to their sins. Rodrigo was captured during the flight, but two of his armourbearers freed him by \\"some clever stratagem\\" and he managed to join the rest of the army in taking refuge in Galicia.CAI, I, ¬ß78. The Chronica notes that \\"prior to this, the Portuguese monarch had come to Galicia several times, but always he had been driven back by Fernando P√©rez and Rodrigo V√©laz and other Galician leaders. Often he was forced to return to Portugal dishonored.\\"CAI, I, ¬ß75. An anonymous poet, writing shortly after the conquest of Almer√≠a in 1147, admits the military prestige of Rodrigo, but that of his father-in-law was greater: Relationship with the Church The former monastery of San Salvador de Lourenz√°, the rare case of a church with which Rodrigo had good relations. On 27 May 1112 Queen Urraca donated some estates that had been illegally usurped by a certain Ermesinda N√∫√±ez and granted to the Diocese of Mondo√±edo to Rodrigo and to the Benedictine monastery of Lorenzana. Then, on 13 June, Rodrigo made a further donation to Lorenzana. His father had lost a case brought before the king against the Diocese of Lugo in 1078 and Rodrigo appears to have harboured some ill will towards the see. In 1113 he is said to have \\"harassed\\" the church of Lugo over jurisdictions.Reilly (1982), 231‚Äì32, 290, and 334. According to the Historia compostellana, Rodrigo visited the Kingdom of Jerusalem around 1121.Barton (1997), 155. He later had a dispute with the bishop of Mondo√±edo, Nu√±o Alfonso, concerning their respective jurisdictions. It was solved by an accord of 20 June 1128. Resolution seems to have been forced on them by Alfonso VII when he was holding court at Palencia.Barton (1997), 214. Notes Bibliography *S. Barton. 1997.

Elected as a member of the state Board of Education as a Democrat in 1994, he became a member of the Republican Party in 1997, and served in the Alabama Senate from 2003 to 2007, representing the state's 32nd district. Byrne was chancellor of the Alabama Community College System from 2007 until he resigned in 2009 to run for the 2010 Republican nomination for governor of Alabama. In December 2013 he won a special election to represent the state's 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. Byrne ran in the Republican primary for the 2020 United States Senate election in Alabama, but was defeated in the first round of the primary by Tommy Tuberville and Jeff Sessions.https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/03/us/elections/results- alabama-senate-primary-election.html Early life and education Bradley Byrne was born in 1955 in Mobile, Alabama. He was one of two children. He was raised in Baldwin County, Alabama. He attended UMS-Wright Preparatory School in Mobile, graduating in 1973. Bryne graduated from Duke University in 1977. At Duke, he became a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. In 1980, he graduated from the University of Alabama School of Law. He was classmates with Mo Brooks. After graduation, he became a private practice lawyer. Political background Byrne's first run for elective office, in 1994, was a success when he was elected to the Alabama State Board of Education as a Democrat. During his term on the Board of Education, Byrne supported a science curriculum that was opposed by many religious leaders in Alabama. He later voted with the Board to support a compromise that said, \\"Explanations of the origin of life and major groups of plants and animals, including humans, shall be treated as theory and not as fact. When attempting to apply scientific knowledge to world problems, no social agenda shall be promoted.\\" In 1996 Byrne voted with the majority of Board members to reject $18 million in federal education funds because it was feared the money would allow greater federal control of schools. The vote was seen as a nod to the growing conservative influence in his south Alabama district. Byrne later changed his mind and convinced the Board to allow the money. In 1997 Byrne left the Democratic Party and became a Republican. In 2002 Byrne ran for an Alabama State Senate seat, representing part of Baldwin County. He won with 91% of the vote over his Democratic challenger.  Chancellor of Alabama's Community College System  In May 2007 Byrne took the position of community college chancellor and oversaw a controversial reordering of much of the system. Bishop State Community College in Mobile was the target of investigators who found both financial and academic issues at the school in 2006 and 2007. Byrne ordered an audit of the school, which demonstrated many deficiencies. At the time, about two dozen people were charged with criminal fraud and theft charges. A total of 27 were charged before the probe ended in May 2007. Byrne also worked with Alabama Attorney General Troy King to recover money stolen from the community college system. He resigned as Chancellor on August 31, 2009. 2010 gubernatorial campaign During the campaign, he was accused by his opponents in the Republican primary of supporting evolution and of doubting that the Bible was infallible. Byrne responded, \\"as a Christian and as a public servant, I have never wavered in my belief that this world and everything in it is a masterpiece created by the hands of God ... As a member of the Alabama Board of Education, the record clearly shows that I fought to ensure the teaching of creationism in our school text books. Those who attack me have distorted, twisted and misrepresented my comments and are spewing utter lies to the people of this state.\\" He also added that he believed \\"every single word\\" of the Bible was true. Post-election activity Following the runoff, Byrne went back to practicing business law, joining the law firm Jones Walker on August 16, 2010. Reform Alabama On February 23, 2011, Byrne announced he was partnering with other prominent Alabamians to create a nonprofit organization that would push for reforms in state government. Named \\"Reform Alabama\\", the organization actively supported legislation in the 2011 Alabama Regular Legislative Session.

United States House of Representatives Elections =2013 special election= On May 23, 2013, U.S. Representative Jo Bonner announced that he would resign, effective August 15, 2013. Byrne finished first in the Republican primary and faced Tea Party candidate Dean Young in the runoff election. Byrne won the runoff, but Young refused to endorse him, which led to rumors of a rift within the Republican Party. But Byrne subsequently gained the endorsement of Alabama Patriots, a Tea Party-affiliated organization. Byrne faced Democratic Party nominee Burton LeFlore on December 17, 2013. Byrne won the election with 71% of the vote. He is only the sixth person to represent this Mobile-based district since 1919, and continues an unbroken run of Republican control in the district dating to 1965. =2014= Byrne was originally expected to be running for reelection unopposed, but Burton LeFlore, his Democratic opponent in the 2013 special election, qualified. Byrne was reelected with 68% of the vote. The district has a PVI of R+15. =2016= Byrne won the Republican primary with 60.1% over his 2013 challenger Young. He was unopposed in the general election.

In 2011, he co-sponsored the Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act, which would have banned abortions based on race or sex. Two years later, in 2013, he co- sponsored the Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act, which would have prohibited federal funds supporting family planning organizations that provide abortions, with exceptions for rape, incest, or if the mother's life is at risk. Byrne also co-sponsored an amendment to the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution that would categorize fetuses as human beings. = Civil rights = In 2019 Byrne voted against the Equality Act, a bill that would expand the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

During the campaign at least nine women alleged that Moore had either sexually assaulted them or made inappropriate romantic or sexual advances toward them while he was an assistant DA and the women were teenagers as young as 14, or while he was a lawyer and the women were clients. Following these allegations, additional ones were made, including attempted rape of a 16-year-old. Moore denied the allegations and his campaign and supporters began questioning the victims' motives and veracity and said they would mount an investigation of the women's motives. Immediately after the allegations and instances of victim intimidation, numerous Republicans rescinded their endorsements of Moore, but Byrne did not, nor did he condemn the Moore campaign's threats against his accusers or call on Moore to drop out of the race. In response to Byrne's continuing support of Moore, Alabama's statewide newspaper group AL.com began running editorial cartoons titled \\"I am Roy Moore\\" with a picture of Byrne and the caption \\"You condone it, you own it.\\" =The Squad= In 2020, Byrne released a campaign ad criticizing The Squad, a group of four women members of the House of Representatives.

Trump impeachment and disruption of hearings On October 23, 2019, Gary Palmer, Jim Jordan, Byrne and Brooks joined about two dozen other House Republicans in aggressively intruding upon a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) where Republican and Democratic congressional members had been taking confidential testimony from Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper as part of the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. Brooks had given an incendiary speech before joining the non-committee Republicans forcing their way into the hearing room, carrying electronic devices that are prohibited in SCIFs.Reps.

Potato doughnuts tend to be lighter than all-flour doughnuts, and are prepared in a similar way as other doughnuts. A chain of Spudnut Shops was established across the United States in the 1950s before declining to a few dozen more recently. Fried ube dough is also eaten in East Asia, including the world‚Äôs most expensive doughnut, the Golden Cristal Ube, which cost $100 each . Much like flour doughnuts, potato doughnuts are often eaten with coffee. History The origin of the potato doughnuts is unknown. Syndicated recipes appeared in American newspapers as early as the 1870s.The Osage County Chronicle, Burlingame Kansas, October 1st 1877The Jewell County Monitor, Mankato Kansas, October 11th 1877 A recipe was published in a 1915 printing of the Five Roses Cook Book in Canada and also in 1938 in the Glenna Snow Cook Book.Akron Beacon Journal (2002). In the late 1930s, Vernon Rudolph began selling Krispy Kreme doughnuts, using a recipe containing potatoes. A chain of Spudnut Shops was established and spread to more than 500 locations in the United States before being thinned out to around 50 in the mid-2000s.Nichols (2006).

Ren√©e is of MƒÅori (NgƒÅti Kahungunu), Irish, English, and Scottish ancestry, and has described herself as a \\"lesbian feminist with socialist working-class ideals\\". She wrote her first play, Setting the Table, in 1981. Many of her plays have been published, with extracts included in Intimate Acts, a collection of lesbian plays published by Brito and Lair, New York. Early life and education Ren√©e was born in Napier, New Zealand. She attended Greenmeadows School in Hawke's Bay. > I liked school. I got a lot of approval there. Except when it came to sport. > I was uninterested. I preferred to read...My interest in theatre started at > school. They used to have a concert every year. The first half would be > items by individuals or groups and the second half would be a play. I was in > two or three plays and I loved it. I loved being someone else even if it was > only for a short time. Ren√©e left school at the age of 12 to work in the local woollen mills and then a printing factory. In 1979, Ren√©e completed a Bachelor of Arts at Auckland University. Completed over ten years, much of her B.A. was gained through extramural study from Massey University. Career Ren√©e is a pioneering figure for women in the New Zealand theatre landscape. Fellow New Zealand playwright, Lorae Parry, has said: > Ren√©e opened the stage door and strode in, announcing her arrival and > standing centre stage. She opened the door with a bang, not with a whimper > and many of us followed. It was time. Someone needed to do it. Ren√©e had the > guts. Ren√©e began writing short stories, reviews and humorous columns for newspapers when her three children were young. She also began acting in the Napier Repertory Theatre. For twenty years she directed plays for a number of theatrical groups and schools in the Hawke's Bay area. Renee's attendance at the United Women's Convention in Wellington in 1975 was an important experience. The convention enabled her to recognise that \\"...a lot of the things I thought and felt resentful about were things other women thought and felt too.\\" A feminist perspective became an important part of her theatre work and writing from that point onwards. In 1979, Ren√©e relocated to Auckland to complete her B.A. at the University of Auckland. During this time, she worked as a cleaner at Auckland's Theatre Corporate. Six years later, she returned to Theatre Corporate as Playwright in Residence. Following her graduation, Ren√©e worked at a secondary school teaching English and Drama. Ren√©e began writing her first play Setting The Table on New Year's Day in 1981, the first draft of which was completed in five days. In a 1982 interview with New Zealand feminist magazine Broadsheet, Ren√©e said she ‚Äúwanted to write a play that showed women as intelligent, humourous and strong. I wanted to write a play with very good parts for women ‚Äî that also put forward some political themes.‚Äù Ren√©e went on to many write plays which feature women in leading roles and humanise working-class people. Ren√©e was invited to attend the First International Women Playwrights Conference in New York in October 1988. She was one of three keynote speakers. She also attended the Pacific Writers Conference in London and took part of in a reading tour of Britain and Europe. Ren√©e has been described as \\"one of the 'first wave' of waahine playwrights\\" whose representation of female characters showed the complexity of MƒÅori women‚Äôs lives and more accurately represented their varied life experiences. Of her background, Ren√©e has said: > My upbringing and conditioning is largely European, but I have an > instinctive love of MƒÅori ritual. Even though I don‚Äôt understand the > language, I feel at home. But I also feel that because of my upbringing, > I‚Äôll always be an outsider in both worlds. It‚Äôs got a lot to do with class, > too ‚Äì my roots are rural. Sometimes I feel alienated from the European > world, and sometimes from the MƒÅori world; because I sometimes feel > inadequate in both of them. Ren√©e chose to use only her first name as her professional name \\"simply because it was the name her mother gave her, and the only one she really felt was hers.\\" Of this decision she has said, \\"I didn't realise I was making a political statement but that's how it is seen, I think.\\" Some of Ren√©e's best known plays form a trilogy, beginning with Wednesday to Come (1985) which shows the effect on a family of the 1930s Great Depression in New Zealand. The characters in Wednesday to Come include three generations of women in one family. Pass It On (1986) follows the two children in Wednesday to Come now that they have grown up and married. It celebrates the role of working class women in the 1951 New Zealand waterfront dispute. Jeannie Once (1991), is a prequel to Wednesday to Come in that it focusses on the past of Wednesday to Come's Granna and her life as a seamstress in Victorian Dunedin. One of the characters in Jeannie Once is a MƒÅori servant, Martha, who ends up being committed to an asylum. Jeannie Once features elements of Music Hall. In October 2017, Ren√©e published a memoir entitled These Two Hands, published by MƒÅkaro Press.

He specialises in church history. Since 2014, he has been Master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge. Previously, he was Dean of Trinity Hall from 2001 to 2010, and Dean of the Chapel of King's College, Cambridge from 2010 to 2014. Early life Morris was born on 22 January 1960 to David and Diana Morris. He studied modern history at Balliol College, Oxford, and graduated Bachelor of Arts (BA) in 1981. He remained at the University of Oxford to undertake post-graduate study, during which he was a temporary lecturer. He was awarded his Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) degree in 1985. His doctoral thesis, on the impact of urban expansion on the development of Victorian and Edwardian organised religion within the parish and borough of Croydon, was published as a book in 1992. Career Early career Following his university studies, Morris worked in management consultancy and university administration. From 1985 to 1987, he was a scholarship officer for the Association of Commonwealth Universities. Then, from 1987 to 1990, he was a senior administrative officer at the London School of Economics. Ordination and ministry Morris left his early career in administration to train for the priesthood. He studied theology at Clare College, Cambridge, graduating Bachelor of Arts (BA) in 1992. He trained for ordination at Westcott House, Cambridge, and completed a Certificate in Theology for Ministry in 1993. He was ordained a deacon in the Church of England in 1993 and a priest in 1994. He served as a curate at St Mary's Church, Battersea, from 1993 to 1996. Academic career In 1996, Morris returned to academia as director of studies and then vice-principal at Westcott House, Cambridge. Later he was a senior associate of the Cambridge Theological Federation and an affiliated lecturer at the Faculty of Divinity, University of Cambridge. He was dean and fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge between 2001 and 2010, and director of studies in theology. He was Dean of Chapel at King's College, Cambridge from 2010 to 2014. In addition, he was a fellow of the college and director of studies in theology and religious studies. Morris's early academic work was in the field of modern British religious history, looking in particular at the impact of urbanization and industrialization on religious change. His first book ‚Äì based on his doctoral thesis ‚Äì was Religion and Urban Change: Croydon 1840‚Äì1914 (1992), and he continues to write on arguments about secularization. His general academic interests also include modern European church history, Anglican theology and ecclesiology (especially High Anglicanism), and the ecumenical movement. His research currently focuses on the social and doctrinal history of the Eucharist in Western Europe since 1800. He is director of the Archbishop‚Äôs Examination in Theology (the \\"Lambeth Awards\\"). He is a former member and deputy chair of the Faith and Order Commission of the Church of England and continues to serve on a number of ecumenical bodies. He has been a visiting lecturer at Cardiff University, the Institute of Theology in Tallinn and the Old Catholic Seminary at the University of Bern. He is also one of the directors of the CRASSH project \\"The Bible and Antiquity in the Nineteenth Century\\". In January 2014, he was elected the 44th Master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He took up the appointment in October 2014, in succession to Martin Daunton. Controversy In 2019, Morris was brought into controversy over past abuse cases whilst working at Trinity Hall, an educational institution where young students reside on site. One lecturer alone sexually harassed 10 students and was allowed to return and continue attending certain events, with Morris (as master) issuing the following statement: ‚ÄúIn line with the rights and privileges afforded to Emeritus Fellows of the College, Dr Hutchinson will continue to attend certain College events and to exercise his dining rights, but will not attend events primarily aimed at students or alumni except by agreement with the College.‚Äù. This was two years after Morris was quoted in The Guardian and Varsity as recognising the \\"seriousness and the formal nature\\" of the complaint. Human rights barrister Charlotte Proudman said, \\"The college has given fellows a licence to abuse their power with impunity. Women students are not safe in their own colleges\\"; while The Guardian called it \\"a gross betrayal to the students\\", and \\"a dangerous environment for women students to study\\". Two weeks later, The Telegraph reported Morris' announcement that a sexual harasser had resigned from his post. Morris said that he would launch a review into the college's handling of the saga. Following the preliminary hearing of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse within the Church of England, Morris talked about his own sexual harassment, \\"Back in the 80s, I was slapped on the bottom on several different occasions by a clergyman at the church I attended. I was taken aback, a bit shocked even, but I was unsure what to think. It was in the presence of his partner. Was it simply playful? Was it a kind of advance? It was certainly unwelcome. But I didn't say anything at the time, and now realize I probably should have done. I think I rather minimised the matter, assuming most people would go for the 'he's just being light- hearted' line and it wasn't worth making a fuss. Also, I rather liked him, and didn't want to make things difficult. A common enough reaction, as I realise. But looking back, it's significant I remember distinctly each occasion, and the very fact that I didn't want it to happen and that it was a repeated pattern puts it in a different light today.\\". In February 2020, Morris stepped aside as Master of Trinity Hall \\"while an investigation into procedures\\" was conducted. Personal life Morris is married to Alexandra, and they have three children: Isobel, William and Ursula. Honours In June 2017, Morris was awarded The Lanfranc Award for Education and Scholarship by the Archbishop of Canterbury.

These were usually formations of 20 to 30 bombers escorted by up to 16 squadrons of escort fighters. Bomber formations of this size could not be ignored by the . At first medium bombers such as the Handley Page Hampden were used but even with many escorts they were too vulnerable to and German fighters. The Hampdens were replaced with Bristol Blenheim light bombers but those fared no better. Heavy bombers such as the Short Stirling were easier to escort but after several missions Bomber Command needed them back. The \\"Hurribomber\\", a fighter-bomber development of the Hawker Hurricane, was used with better results except that the small bomb load caused little damage. There were other codenames for similar missions. * Ramrod: similar to Circus but with destroying a target being the principal aim. An example would be Operation Ramrod 16. * Ranger: large fighter formation intrusion over occupied territory with aim of wearing down German fighter force. * Roadstead: low-level attack on coastal shipping. * Rhubarb: small-scale freelance fighter sorties against ground targets of opportunity. History Following the end of the Battle of Britain RAF Fighter Command moved from defensive to offensive operations where they would engage German fighters on the other side of the Channel; the operational instructions were ready by December 1940. There would be two types of offensive operation: \\"Rhubarb\\" (initially called Mosquito) in which small patrols would cross under cover of cloudy conditions and engage any aircraft they found and on clear weather days \\"Circus\\" which would send several squadrons - possibly with a few bombers - in sweeps of northern France. Circus came to mean an operation with bombers.Sholto Douglas \\"1941: The Difficult Year\\" Rhubarb patrols began in December 1940; while the pilots were allowed to attack ground targets if any presented itself their primary objective was to bring down German aircraft. By mid-June 1941, Fighter Command had flown 149 Rhubarb patrols (336 sorties) claiming seven enemy aircraft brought down for loss of eight pilots on the British side. Circus operations with bombers began in January and eleven had been carried out by June, the targets including docks on the French coast and airfields. More than forty sweeps without bombers had been made in the same period. While Fighter Command's priority was the German fighters, Bomber Command concentrated on destroying the ground targets. At higher level in the RAF it was felt that the effects on the war by damage that could be inflicted by the bombers would be minimal; the commanders of Bomber and Fighter Commands held a conference that agreed that the purpose of a Circus was to force German fighters into combat in circumstances that favoured the British and to that end the bombers had to do enough damage that the could not ignore the attacks. Prior to Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the USSR, Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Portal the Chief of the Air Staff directed Fighter and Bomber Commands to find a way to keep German fighters in western Europe rather than reinforce the in eastern Europe. The resulting policy was to make Circus operations against industrial targets in the region of Bethune, Lille in north-east France; this might draw German fighter defences towards the area leaving the defences on the flanks weaker for unescorted bombers to make daylight attacks on Germany. At the same time night bombing operations would be made against the Ruhr industrial region. The Air Ministry directed the RAF that the purpose of Circuses would be destruction of the ground targets with German fighters as secondary priority. It soon became clear that unescorted daylight bombing was too risky and heavy bombers should be used on night operations only. Over six weeks RAF Fighter Command flew 8,000 sorties in support of 376 bomber sorties and a further 800 sorties on sweeps. Fighter Command was losing pilots and aircraft on operations over Europe but losses were lighter than during the Battle of Britain and aircraft losses were replaceable. In August, Circuses were flown with 2 Group and 5 Groups, Bomber Command. See also * Royal Air Force daylight raids, 1940-1944 Notes Footnotes References * Caygill, Peter.

Rothstein (born June 10, 1962) is a disbarred lawyer and the former managing shareholder, chairman, and chief executive officer of the now-defunct Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler law firm. He was accused of funding an extravagant lifestyle with a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme, one of the largest such in history. On December 1, 2009, Rothstein turned himself in to authorities and was subsequently arrested on charges related to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Although his arraignment plea was not guilty, Rothstein cooperated with the Government and reversed his plea to guilty of five federal crimes on January 27, 2010. Rothstein was denied bond by U.S. Magistrate Judge Robin Rosenbaum, who ruled that due to his ability to forge documents, he was considered a flight risk.  Overview  On June 9, 2010, Rothstein received a 50-year prison sentence after a hearing in federal court in Fort Lauderdale, although federal prosecutors in 2011 filed a motion notifying the court they would be seeking a sentence reduction for Rothstein. His firm had 70 lawyers and 150 employees, with offices in Boca Raton, West Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Miami, Tallahassee, Florida, New York City and Caracas, Venezuela. The firm focused on labor and employment matters, civil rights, intellectual property, internet law, corporate espionage, personal injury, wrongful death, commercial litigation, real estate, mergers and acquisitions, and governmental relations. His client list included Citicorp, J. C. Penney, Ed Morse Automotive Group, National Beverage, Silversea Cruise Lines, Supra Telecom, and Wells Fargo. Until he was permanently disbarred by the Florida Supreme Court on November 25, 2009, Rothstein was a member of the Florida Bar and admitted by the United States Supreme Court. He had been given an AV Preeminent peer review rating by Martindale-Hubbell. The AV rating is a significant accomplishment and a testament to the fact that a lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence. Rothstein may have stolen millions of dollars from an investment side-business. A list of 259 persons or corporate entities entitled to $279 million in restitution has been sealed by the court. On November 3, 2009, Federal Bureau of Investigation and United States Department of the Treasury agents served a warrant to search the firm's Fort Lauderdale offices. Rothstein sent an email in recent weeks to firm lawyers asking them to investigate which countries refused to extradite criminal suspects to either the U.S. or Israel, and firm lawyers responded that Morocco is one such country. Rothstein had wired $16 million to an individual in Casablanca and left for Casablanca on October 26, 2009. On October 31, 2009, he sent a suicide text message note to all of his law partners: > Sorry for letting you all down. I am a fool. I thought I could fix it, but > got trapped by my ego and refusal to fail, and now all I have accomplished > is hurting the people I love. Please take care of yourselves and please > protect Kimmie [Rothstein's wife]. She knew nothing. Neither did she, nor > any of you deserve what I did. I hope God allows me to see you on the other > side. Love, Scott. On November 3, 2009, after many texts by Stuart Rosenfeldt, the president of the firm, urging him to \\"choose life\\", Rothstein returned to Fort Lauderdale on a chartered jet, (chartered by the ex-husband of Governor Crist's wife, Todd Rome) from Casablanca. On November 2, his law firm with only $117,000 in its operating account filed suit against him, asked a judge to dissolve the firm, accusing him of misappropriating hundreds of millions of dollars from investor trust accounts in a Ponzi scheme from an investment business he covertly ran out of his law office. In 2009 Rothstein resided at the Federal Detention Center, Miami in Downtown Miami,McMahon, Paula and Tonya Alanez. \\"Rothstein's dive from Bahia Drive: Miami detention center humbles lifestyle of disgraced attorney.\\" The Palm Beach Post. Tuesday December 8, 2009. Retrieved on December 30, 2009. but was later moved to an undisclosed location and his inmate number removed from the Federal Bureau of Prisons inmate locator webpage.  Background and career  Rothstein was born in the Bronx and moved with his parents to Lauderhill, Florida as a teenager. A 1988 Juris Doctor graduate of Fort Lauderdale's Nova Southeastern University's Law School, the Shepard Broad College of Law, and a 1984 Bachelor of Arts graduate of University of Florida, Rothstein's law career began in 1988 and, for nearly fifteen years, he was relatively unknown. His local mentors were wealthy attorneys, Donald McClosky and Bill Scherer. In the early 1990s, Rothstein first partnered with attorney Howard Kusnick. First located in Plantation, Florida, Kusnick & Rothstein, P.A. subsequently moved to downtown Ft. Lauderdale. Longtime partner Michael Pancier first joined him there. In 2000, Rothstein joined with Rosenfeldt as a name partner at the Hollywood firm, Phillips Eisinger Koss & Rosenfeldt, P.A., which became known as Phillips Eisinger Koss Rothstein & Rosenfeldt, P.A In February 2002, Rothstein and Rosenfeldt started their own firm, first known as Rothstein & Rosenfeldt, P.A. Within a month, Pancier was added as a name partner. In July, 2002, adding Susan Dolin, a well-regarded employment lawyer, now practicing on her own in West Broward, the firm became known as Rothstein, Rosenfeldt, Dolin & Pancier, P.A.. In late 2004, the firm became known simply as Rothstein Rosenfeldt, with Adler being added in March 2005. Melissa Britt Lewis, who was murdered in March, 2008, was with Rothstein from the firm's beginning. In seven years, he and his partners expanded the firm to 70 lawyers, including former Boca Raton Mayor and sitting Palm Beach County Commissioner Steve Abrams; former judges Julio Gonzalez, Barry Stone, and former Palm Beach circuit judge, William Berger; TV and radio legal commentator and former prosecutor, Ken Padowitz; Carlos Reyes, former South Broward Hospital District commissioner and lobbyist; Arthur Neiwirth, a bankruptcy expert; and Les Stracher, former legal counsel for Morse Auto Group, who represents major auto dealers. Others include: Shawn Birken, son of Circuit Court Judge Arthur Birken; Ben Dishowitz, son of County Court Judge Dishowitz; and Grant Smith, son of disgraced former Congressman Larry Smith. Andrew Barnett is Corporate Development Officer, and David Boden, a New York attorney not licensed in Florida, was the firm's general counsel.  Recent  On September 8, 2011, U.S. District Judge James I. Cohn granted the government's motion to prohibit videotaping Rothstein during a scheduled deposition of him, citing \\"serious harm\\" and \\"security reasons that are unusual in nature.\\" The exact reasons for the judge's decision were sealed. This fueled speculation that his appearance was altered or he was a mafia target due to his cooperation with the prosecution against the mafia. On June 8, 2011, federal prosecutors filed a motion with the sentencing judge informing him that they would be asking for a sentence reduction for Rothstein. However, on September 26, 2017, prosecutors withdrew their motion for a reduced sentence, saying that he had provided \\"false material information\\" in violation of his plea agreement. Rothstein's name does not appear in the Federal Bureau of Prisons inmate database. This indicates he is being held under an alias, which would not be unusual given that he cooperated with the government. As of November 18, 2009, many of the associates have relocated: Five lawyers moved to Fort Lauderdale-based Rice Pugatch Robinson & Schiller. Steven Lippman and Richard Storfer will be new partners. Riley Cirulnick, George Zinkler and Jodi Cohen are new associates. In August, 2008, Governor Crist appointed Rothstein as a member of the 4th District Court of Appeal Judicial nominating commission, a body which is responsible for selecting new judges for appointment to the Court. Bill Brock accompanied Rothstein to Morocco. His job at the law firm was to issue checks for Rothstein's various ventures and contributions, and had the sole security pass for the area where records of Rothstein's non-law firm businesses were kept. An observant Jew, Rothstein grew up in a small Bronx apartment, sharing a bedroom with his sister. His father was a salesman \\"back in the days when you carried a bag up and down the streets of New York.\\" The family moved to Lauderhill, Florida in 1977, when Rothstein was 16. His grandmother used her life savings to help put him through school. \\"I grew up poor. I'm a lunatic about money.\\" Rothstein was a large contributor to a synagogue off Las Olas with his name affixed to the front facade: The Rothstein Family Downtown Jewish Center Chabad. Rabbi Schneur Kaplan is one of the two people who talked Rothstein out of committing suicide. He invested in residential property. In 2003, he paid $1.2 million for an intracoastal waterfront house on Castilla Isle in Fort Lauderdale. In March 2005, he bought a neighboring home belonging to Miami Dolphins' Ricky Williams for $2.73 million. While living in Williams' old house, he's purchased two other homes on the street and three other homes in Broward for a total residential investment of nearly $20 million. \\"They call me the king of Castilla.\\" In 2008, he purchased a $6.45 million waterfront gated Fort Lauderdale home, a $6 million condo in New York in the same building as Marc Dreier, and a $2.8 million oceanfront estate in Narragansett, Rhode Island formerly owned by troubled client, Michael Kent, a Fort Lauderdale nightclub owner. He is part-owner with Anthony Bova of the South Beach Versace Casa Casuarina mansion, where he was married on January 26, 2008, in a three-day wedding celebration with Governor Crist, and his then-fianc√©e and present wife, Carol Rome, in attendance. A later financial analysis of the 10% property interest Rothstein owned showed that it was worthless. His second wife, Kimberly Wendell Rothstein, a 35-year-old real- estate agent, helped manage his properties, which also include part-ownership of an office building in Pompano Beach. He and Bova also owned Bova Ristorante, formerly long-time generational Italian family-owned Mario's of Boca, which shut down October 18, 2009. Bova Prime, formerly Riley McDermott's on Las Olas Boulevard is still operating. On September 11, 2008, the day before Rothstein took ownership, a dispute involving firearms broke out at Riley McDermott's involving Rothstein's security personnel. He owns parts of an internet technology called company Qtask and V Georgio Spirits Co., LLC with CEO Vie Harvey and the Renato watch company, with partner, Ovi Levy. Levy is the son of hotelier Shimon Levy, who spent a year in prison in Israel after hiding a criminal kingpin, suspected of two murders. Rothstein at one time was a minority shareholder of Edify LLC, a health-care benefits consulting company. State Representative Evan Jenne-D-Dania Beach is a $30,000 company consultant, who previously worked a local bank. Rothstein hired Jenne's father, former sheriff and convicted felon, Ken Jenne, as a consultant at his law firm days after Jenne was released from prison on corruption charges. An attorney for Rothstein's law firm serves as the registered agent for Evan Jenne's company, Blue Banyan. Grant Smith, a lifelong friend of Evan Jenne's, is an Edify lobbyist. Edify has worked closely with the state Department of Health to develop wellness programs and also influences certain health-care legislation.  \\"The Great Gatsby\\"  In the 2008 interview at his law firm, Rothstein described himself and told how he controlled all aspects of the firm's management: > This is where the evil happens. Look, I sleep in the bed I make. I tend > toward the flashy side, but it's a persona. It's just a fucking persona. ... > People ask me, 'When do you sleep?' I say I'll sleep when I'm dead. I'm a > true Gemini. I joke around that there are 43 people living in my head and > you never know what you're going to get. There are some philanthropists in > there, some good lawyers, and I like to think some good businessmen. There > are also some guys from the streets of the Bronx that stay hidden away until > I need them. Does that sound crazy? I am crazy, but crazy in a good way. His personal office was opulent, with security and a compartmentalized layout. Anyone entering Rothstein's suite of offices had to use an intercom. He could exit, unseen through a second door. In the hallway, an ordinary looking brown door is actually the elevator door. Dozens of surveillance cameras and microphones hang from office ceilings. On his desk: four computer screens and the Five Books of Moses. Outside his personal office hung a painting of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone in The Godfather. The walls of Rothstein's office and other hallways are lined with photos of himself and politicians including Gov. Charlie Crist, former U.S. Senator Mel Martinez, Senator John McCain, Broward Sheriff Al Lamberti, Rudy Giuliani, Joe Lieberman, and Bill McCollum. He was ostensibly an affluent and successful attorney with all the material trappings of a flamboyant lifestyle, including armed body guards and police protection. Twenty-eight city police officials, including captains, majors, undercover officers and the department spokesman, helped guard his home and businesses, the only person in the department's history to have permanent round-the-clock off-duty police protection at his home. The department suspended all work for Rothstein on November 2, 2009. He had a Boeing 727 jet and in 2002, flew Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey, and Chris Tucker to Africa on an anti-AIDS mission. He owns an $5 million Warren yacht. His fleet of exotic cars included: 1974, 2006, 2007, and 2008 Ferraris, 2009 Bentley, 2007 Silver Rolls-Royce, and one 2008 and two 2010 Lamborghini Murcielagos ‚Äî worth about $400,000 each, a pair of $1.6 million Bugattis, and a pair of Harleys which he maintains in an air-conditioned warehouse. All were allegedly purchased and traded from Euromotorsports, the owner of which has an extensive criminal record. All were seized shortly after his return from Morocco. He has a watch collection of over 100, valued at $1 million. In 2008, he was working on opening a cigar and martini bar on Las Olas Boulevard and two high-rise residential buildings in Brooklyn with New York partner Dominic Tonnachio. He was to take ownership of a \\"series of office buildings\\" on Oakland Park Boulevard. Roger Stone, a political trickster for Richard Nixon, was a partner with Rothstein in RRA Consulting, an LLC which was set up to provide public affairs assistance to the RRA law firm's legal clients. According to Stone, that business never generated any clients. It was dissolved in late 2008. On August 27, 2009, Stone, the recipient of Rothstein's sponsorship of his blog until July 29, 2009, \\"StoneZone\\", wrote a column recommending Rothstein for the seat vacated by Senator Mel Martinez- a man with \\"a distinguished legal record, has been a key supporter of Governor Crist and John McCain, has an unmatched record of philanthropic activities and would bring an unconventional style of getting things done to Washington. Add Rothstein to the short list.\\" On November 4, 2009, Stone wrote, \\"Rothstein had no prior business success, no business acumen nor track record that would engender confidence in an investor. He could not read a balance sheet. He could not write or read a business plan. Rothstein was a lawyer, not an entrepreneur.\\" Stone claims that Rothstein has Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) \\"so severe he never finished a martini, a cigar, a thought, or a sentence, never mind a transaction.\\" According to Stone, neither law firm name partner Russell Adler nor Stuart Rosenfeldt were signatories on the RRA Trust Account. He \\"appeared to be something out of a Great Gatsby movie.\\"  Philanthropy and political contributions  In 2008, his Rothstein Family Foundation gave $1 million to Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, where a lobby will be named after him and his wife. On October 31, 2009 his firm sponsored at a charity golf tournament featuring former Gov. Jeb Bush. Between 2007 and 2008, he donated $2 million to the American Heart Association, Women in Distress, Alonzo Mourning Charities, Here's Help, and the Dan Marino Foundation. Politicians of both parties have pledged to donate to charity or return his political contributions. On November 3, 2009, the Florida Republican Party, announced it would give Rothstein's donations ($600,000) to a charity. Gov. Charlie Crist's Senate Campaign ($100,550), state Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink ($2,050), Senate President Jeff Atwater, Rep. Ellyn Bogdanoff, and the Florida Democratic Party ($200,000) will return some or all of his contributions. In June 2009, Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate majority leader received a contribution of $4,800. A list of FEC filings indexed by NewsMeat include a total of $166,800 to the Republican Party and candidates, including $109,800 to John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, and $17,600 to Democratic candidates.  Law partner murder  Debra Villegas, who handles his money, is the law firm's chief operating officer. She is co-owner with Rothstein in a home at 2307 Castilla Isle, as of May 2009. According to records, Rothstein originally purchased the property in September 2007, for $1.75 million, and sold it for $10 to a shell corporation in September 2009. In 2005, the year the Ponzi scheme allegedly began, Villegas earned $80,000 a year. In 2007, her salary had increased to $145,000. Villegas received two Swiss watches ‚Äî a Rolex and a Breitling ‚Äî from her \\"employer\\". Rothstein paid off her couch and a bedroom set and held title to her two Honda water scooters. Villegas was living in a $475,000 Weston home that Rothstein signed over to her in July 2009 for $100 and \\"love and affection,\\" according to the deed. Villegas registered a 2009 $100,000 Maserati GranTurismo at the home in January, 2009. In November 2009, Federal prosecutors seized the home, alleging that it was among Rothstein's ill-gotten assets. Villegas' estranged husband, Tony Villegas, was charged on circumstantial evidence in the March 2008 murder in Plantation, Florida of Melissa Britt Lewis, a partner in Rothstein's firm. Although early news reports wondered at whether the evidence was substantial, according to New Times, \\"Nine days later, forensic testing revealed that Tony's DNA had been found on Melissa's suit jacket ‚Äì the same jacket she wore on the day she died.\\" Police sealed the arrest affidavit. As a result of the homicide and the nature of the legal business, Rothstein has a team of \\"executive protection specialists\\" to guard the firm and his family, his teen- aged daughter. The prosecutor who had first worked on the Villegas case, Howard Scheinberg, went to work for Rosenfeldt Rothstein Adler. Villegas, a train conductor, remains in jail awaiting trial. The motive was supposedly revenge for Lewis's closeness with Debra. Debra and Melissa share a therapist: Ilene Vinikoor, whose husband, David represents general counsel, David Boden in the Ponzi scheme investigation. > You get anger from people ... that prick from the Bronx. ... They say I'm > building the law firm too fast, that it must be a house of cards.  \\"Disbarment on consent\\"  On November 17, 2009, the Florida Bar Executive Committee voted to accept a request by Rothstein to be disbarred. The Florida Supreme Court entered an order permanently disbarring Rothstein on November 25, 2009.http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/pub_info/summaries/briefs/09/09-2146/Filed_11-25-2009_Order_Disbarment.pdf Rothstein was removed from the Broward County Grievance Committee, and his name has also been removed from the database of The Best Lawyers in America.  Trust account  Rothstein, Rosenfeldt, and Adler's trust account was part of the Interest on Lawyer Trust Accounts (IOLTA) program that was paying hundreds of thousands of dollars a month to the Florida Bar Foundation.  $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme  Rothstein's investment scheme involved purchasing what were initially mislabeled as fabricated \\"structured settlements,\\" described as where people sell large settlements in legal cases for lump sums of cash. Alan Sakowitz, an attorney and real estate developer in Bay Harbor Islands, said that he contacted the FBI in September with concerns about Rothstein. On Sunday, November 8, 2009, Sakowitz appeared with Kendall Coffey, attorney for Rothstein's law partners, on the Michael Putney Show on WPLG-TV, MIAMI, correcting Coffey for claiming that Rothstein's \\"investments\\" involved structured settlements, which they did not. (Note: \\"structured settlements\\" as defined by Rothstein in press reports do not meet the definition in IRC 5891(C)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code). Rothstein's resemble investments in pre-settlement funding or pre-settlement financing. In his December 12, 2011 deposition page 24 lines 15-23, Scott Rothstein himself said \\"It was intentionally made in a way and presented to that firm and the other firms that were looking at the structure issue that it was merely a purchase of dollars already in-house; that it was not a structured settlement because the true definition of a structured settlement is when someone is actually receiving payments over time that has some other value. We didn't have a true definition of a structured settlement, not by any of the statutes. From that perspective we had reason to make sure that this was not structured. Because when you're dealing with structured settlements you need other levels of Court approval. It would have required the manufacturer of literally hundreds of phony orders, which would have led the entire scheme to detection.' The FBI estimates the loss to be up to a billion dollars from lucrative whistle-blower and employment discrimination cases. The investors would make up-front cash payments to individuals owed money from the court cases to buy the right to collect the full amount of the settlements later. The investor was guaranteed a minimum of 20 percent investment returns in as little as three months.  Swindle pitch  General counsel David Boden was present for at least one of the swindles, and negotiated the final papers with the investors' lawyers. Rothstein greets and informs the investor his firm was the preeminent sexual harassment law firm in the country. He says he'd figured out a basic formula which was that someone with $10 million net worth was usually willing to pay $2 million in cash to pay off their mistress. The key was confidentiality. Rothstein tells the investor that he would meet potential defendants in his office and would question them about affairs they had with an employee. The defendants would deny it. He pointed to artwork, and said there was a television screen behind it. He tells the investor he turned on a video of the guy having sex with his mistress, and told his client \\"We can either settle this now, or I can depose your wife, your mistress, you and your son about it.\\" Since defendants\\" often couldn't or wouldn't pay the entire settlement up-front, Rothstein tells the investor that his first harassment case many years ago, involved a $3.5 million settlement and a million-dollar legal fee, so Rothstein assigned the settlement to a good friend and the plaintiff settles for $3 million without a trial. The \\"good friend\\" stood to be paid $3.5 million once the defendant paid up, a half-million dollar profit. > \\"In 20 years, I have never seen a defendant sue on breach of settlement,\\" > Rothstein told them. \\"The whole idea is that it's secret. Why would they > sue?\\" Although it did not appear completely legitimate, and it might have appeared that the plaintiffs were short-changed, it makes sense to the potential investor. The idea seems solid. The investor thinks that with enough of these cases at Rothstein's law firm, he could make huge sums of money. Rothstein then discusses other larger cases: Eli Lilly and Company, involving $1.4 billion with plaintiff representation by Gary Farmer, a firm attorney who negotiated the settlement and who brought the case with him when he arrived at the firm. Several inside whistleblowers went to the fed with unlawful practices regarding the marketing and sales of an anti-psychotic medication called Zyprexa. It was one of the largest qui tam cases in history. He tells the investor about a potential (allegedly fabricated) case where investors would buy whistle-blower million dollar settlements with a sixty percent short term investor profit. The arrangement would be completely secret; the investor would never know the name of the company or the whistle-blower. The settlement money would be deposited into a trust account at TD Bank, accessible only to the investor at the appropriate time. David Boden follows up with all questions and negotiates the contract.  Court-appointed receiver  On November 2, 2009, Broward Chief Judge Vic Tobin sent an e-mail at 6:45 a.m. to judges about the Rothstein case: > I learned of some very distressing news yesterday. Whoever draws the case > try to set the motion today because of the amount of clients and money > involved. Also, if you have a case with the firm, please be patient. I don't > know if the lawyers will come or not and if they do come, there is no money > at this point to go forward with the case or pay firm employees. On November 3, 2009, retired Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Herbert Stettin was appointed the firm's receiver, responsible for approving the firm's day-to-day financial decisions. Firm president and 50% owner of the firm, Stuart Rosenfeldt, \\"deposited two-thirds of my life savings in my firm's operating account\\" to prop up finances in the short-term. Marc Nurik is representing Rothstein, and has stepped down as a lawyer from the firm. The prosecutors are Lawrence D. LaVecchio, Paul F. Schwartz and Jeffrey N. Kaplan. They have decades of experience investigating public corruption, white-collar fraud and organized crime. They are preparing a massive fraud case against Rothstein, zeroing in on his settlement investments, and also allegations of theft from his law firm and client trust accounts.  Victims  On November 25, 2009, Attorney William Scherer filed a 289-page Amended Complaint seeking $100,000,000 in civil damages on behalf of his clients, and naming: Toronto Dominion Bank and its associates, Frank Spinosa, Jennifer Kerstetter, and Rosanne Karetsky, Irene Stay, Banyon Income Fund, L.P., Banyon USVI, LLC, George G. Levin, Michael Szafranski, Onyx Options Consultants Corporation, Berenfeld Spritzer Shechter Sheer, LLP., as well as Rothstein and his associates, David Boden, Debra Villegas, Andrew Barnett, and Frank J. Preve, as defendants/co- conspirators.http://blogs.browardpalmbeach.com/pulp/schereramended.pdf http://blogs.browardpalmbeach.com/pulp/scherersuit.pdf The Amended Complaint lists people and businesses to whom Rothstein allegedly wired money while he was en route to or inside of Morocco: Rothstein wired $16 million to his tour guide from Boca Raton, Florida, \\"Ahnick Kahlid\\". Kahlid transferred the money to Rothstein's new Moroccan bank account opened upon his arrival with a passport as identification at Banque Populaire in Casablanca; The recipients allegedly are members of the \\"Israeli Mob\\"; New York Investors; Florida Investors; Real Estate Investors; and Levin Feeders. Scherer has said that his clients and all other investors who weren't complicit in the crime will have their money returned. Due to the extreme negligence, TD Bank is liable. \\"My goal is to get all the money back for the investors from the bank,\\" Scherer said. On January 27, 2010 Scherer filed an affidavit alleging that Michael Szafranski was complicit in Rothstein's fraud, receiving almost $6.5 million in \\"ill-gotten\\" gains directly from Rothstein.http://blogs.browardpalmbeach.com/pulp/schereraffidavit.pdf Shimon Levy and Ovi Levy Shimon Levy allegedly has had deep ties to Israeli organized crime and spent a year in an Israeli prison for hiding a mob figure suspected of two \\"grisly murders\\". In 1997, his partner at the Sea Club Resort on Fort Lauderdale beach, Zvika Yuz, was a victim of a murder which remains unsolved. His son, Ovi contacted the Plantation Police Department and began receiving protection during the time Rothstein fled to Morocco.  Banyan Capital  Banyan Income Fund, a Fort Lauderdale-based hedge fund, invested hundreds of millions. It was run by Rothstein and involves Fort Lauderdale businessman George G. Levin, who reported Rothstein to the U.S. Attorney's Office for \\"suspicious activity.\\" According to the lawsuit, Frank J. Preve is Chief Operating Officer and kept an office inside Rothstein et al. He is a convicted bank fraud and embezzlement felon. He pleaded guilty to bank embezzlement charges in 1985 and received ten years probation and a $10,000 fine for falsifying loan documents in another fraudulent scheme. Banyon and other Rothstein investors' accounts were held at a Toronto-Dominion Bank branch in Fort Lauderdale. = Abraxas Discala = Abraxas Discala, a businessman and former husband of The Sopranos' Jamie-Lynn Sigler, reportedly raised $30 million through his hedge fund which he invested into Rothstein's scheme. = George G. Levin = Since 1983, George G. Levin and his wife, Gayla Sue, have lived in Fort Lauderdale's Bay Colony on the Intracoastal Waterway in a 2-story home with 8 bathrooms and a large pool, valued at $2 million. Levin has a pattern of filing complaints when his unsavory/fraudulent business ventures are exposed. According to federal court documents, from 1985‚Äì1996 Levin's former business GGL Industries, dba Classic Motor Carriages defrauded hundreds of customers, selling kit cars. The federal government filed criminal charges against the company and GGL pleaded guilty to mail fraud in 1999 and agreed to pay $2.5 million in restitution. Stuart Rado had been a consumer activist who organized GGL's victims and helped spur the government action. Levin subsequently sued Rado for violating the Florida Trade Secrets Act. Rado was diagnosed with cancer during the lawsuit. It was a classic frivolous SLAPP suit (\\"Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation\\"). On September 19, 1997, the finding against Mr. Rado was that he pay plaintiff's attorneys' fees. > The federal motion states: GGL's fraudulent scheme necessarily included as > an intricate part the silencing of its critics, among whom was Rado. It did > this by using the courts to intimidate Rado into being silent and causing > Rado to spend money he could not afford. It was GGL's intention (as one of > GGL's attorneys said to Rado [in a 1994 deposition]) to make Rado's net > worth go south. GGL and its attorneys forced Rado to incur the expenses of > defending two lawsuits for over 4 years.

Although a convicted felon, GGL hounded Rado's estate for the payment of $80,000 in attorney's fees. The state of Florida filed suit against the company alleging deceptive business practices and civil theft. A special assistant attorney general, Herbert Stettin, led the investigation. Stettin is now the trustee overseeing the Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler bankruptcy case. Levin continues to sell kit cars under a different company name, StreetBeasts. According to a Florida District Court of Appeals case published in 2002, Levin acquired property free and clear for less than the cost of the first mortgage, through a fraudulent transfer.http://www.estatetaxlawyers.com/articles/2002%20Bankruptcy%20Reform%20Update.pdf = Partners' income strategy and Rothstein's returns = The allegations are: George Levin was the general partner (\\"GP\\") who solicited each limited partner (\\"LP\\") to contribute at least $1 million. Initially, each LP contributed $250,000, subject to periodic capital calls up to the amount of their commitments. They were promised 12% annually (15% for first $100 million), to be paid quarterly. The general partner had to maintain a balance of not less than 10% of all contributions after any quarterly distributions. The general partner also gave a \\"clawback\\" guaranty to all LP's equal to their original contributions. LP's could not request redemptions during an initial one-year \\"lock-up\\" period and were required to give 90 days' notice for any withdrawals. Redemptions would be paid from the GP's own capital account \\"to the extent available\\" with a 10% hold-back, but otherwise, only from the purchased lawsuits settlement stream. Banyon had paid Rothstein's firm at least $656 million, but the law firm anticipated $1.1 billion over a maximum 24-month period. It allegedly received and reinvested about $500 million. Levin expected to make 40% over 24 months but to only pay out 24%. Rothstein's law firm's IOLTA trust accounts established \\"for the plaintiff\\" in the purported litigation settlements were used to fund the phony settlement accounts, after the law firm had paid its overhead, keeping its insolvent operation afloat, which included \\"gifts\\" to partners and money given to politicians, charities, and pay for a massive advertising budget, as well as Rothstein's personal lifestyle, over three years, amounting to approximately a $500 million loss. The interest on the funded IOLTA accounts went to the Florida Bar monthly, which was many millions, based on the Banyon contributions. In its prospectus, Banyon claimed to have a legal opinion that Banyon's interest in the IOLTA trust accounts \\"perfected automatically on execution of the transfer documents\\" ‚Äì that the lawsuit proceeds assignments created by general counsel, David Boden. The LP's were warned that they could be taxed on the Partnership's income and realized gains even if no distributions were made. As long as reinvestments were ongoing, the ponzi scheme was facilitated. = Losses = 1\\\\.

He was born the 16th of August 1959 in Tilburg, Netherlands and has lived in Amsterdam since 1982. He received highest honours for international documentaries at the Sundance Festival and was the first two-time International Documentary winner at the International Documentary Filmfestival Amsterdam (IDFA). On June 5, 2018 he was rewarded by the Dutch King Willem- Alexander with the title Knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion, a very high distinction. Helmrich is famous for perfecting the 'Single Shot Cinema' filming method and his related technical camera innovations. \\"...you can move inside an event and go with your camera to the right spot, at the right moment,... That‚Äôs what the whole single-shot cinema is about: trying to think of the world as a kind of clockwork, a machinery, with everything interrelated. The bigger and smaller things are just as important. In a clockworks you can‚Äôt pull out a little gear because the whole thing jams. The solution is to become one of the clockworks.\\", Leonard Retel Helmrich. Biography After Indonesian independence the Helmrich family repatriated to the Netherlands during the Indo diaspora. His father, Jean Retel Helmrich, was born to a wealthy totok family in Semarang, Dutch East Indies, fought against the Japanese invaders during World War II and was interred as a POW for three years. After the war he married a Javanese woman. ‚ÄúIt was forbidden,‚Äù Mr. Helmrich's sister and producer, Hetty Naaijkens-Retel Helmrich, explained. ‚ÄúThey had to get permission from the Queen, from the Indonesian government, the Dutch government, the Muslim church, and the Catholic Church. It was Romeo and Juliet.‚Äù Growing up, the filmmaker ‚Äúhad a lot of problems because of his dyslexia,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe teachers were always complaining that he was living in his own world, but already when he was a little boy he made very good drawings.‚Äù The family's belief in him extended to financing ‚ÄúEye of the Day‚Äù and getting involved in other ways. Ms. Naaijkens-Retel Helmrich's production company, Scarabee, produces Mr. Helmrich's films; her son, Jasper Naaijkens, is his uncle's editor ‚Äî which cannot be any easy job, considering Mr. Helmrich can come up with hourlong shots. Leonard Retel Helmrich graduated from the Dutch Film and Television Academy in 1986 and in 1990 he made his first feature film, The Phoenix Mystery. His first documentary, Moving Objects (1991) was awarded the Special Jury Price for the Best Artist-Profile at the International Golden Gate Film Festival of San Francisco. Retel Helmrich developed his own cinematic style based on a principle which he has developed and calls \\"Single Shot Cinema\\". After finishing the film Moving Objects, he decided to travel to Indonesia where his parents were born, with the idea to show people around the world what was happening in this beautiful and very complicated country. He discovered that the authority of President Suharto was declining. In 1995 he made a film about Suharto and his wife in their Jakartan palace. He then went to Solo in central Java to film a demonstration against the Suharto regime. During his activities he was arrested by the police and accused of being a Western spy. With the help of the Dutch Embassy and his brother Anton, who happened to be in Indonesia, he was released after a few days. However, he was expelled from the country with the status \\"persona non grata\\" meaning he would no longer be allowed to visit Indonesia. Leonard Retel Helmrich traveled to Kansas City, Missouri to work with the Institute of Art in developing the principles of Single Shot Cinema. In 1997 his brother succeeded to convince the Indonesian government to change his \\"persona non grata\\" status and Leonard Retel Helmrich was allowed to return to finish his work. Unfortunately a lot of material had been destroyed or was unusable. He decided to change his strategy. Many journalists were reporting the fall of Suharto and Retel Helmrich wanted to focus on the micro-aspects of the changes by following an Indonesian family in one of Jakarta's slums. All the changes in politics, religion, islamization, poverty, social injustice, globalization, criminality, corruption, etc. affected every Indonesian in his daily life. Thus he came up with the idea to film a triptych about the struggle for survival of a family in those trying days in Indonesia. In 2001 he finished Eye of the Day (Stand van de Zon) and in 2004 he made Shape of the Moon (Stand van de Maan) which became a worldwide success. Since then Retel Helmrich's films have screened and won acclaim at film festivals worldwide, garnering major awards for both his drama and documentary work. His awards include the inaugural World Cinema Jury Prize Documentary at Sundance 2005 and the prestigious Joris Ivens Award at IDFA Amsterdam 2004 for his Indonesian feature documentary Shape of the Moon (Stand van de Maan). In 2010 he won for the second time the Grand VPRO/IDFA Award for feature documentary for Position Among the Stars (Stand van de Sterren) together with the IDFA Award for the best Dutch documentary. It was the first time in the IDFA history that a director won this award for the second time. In January 2011 he won again at Sundance where he received the World Cinema Documentary Special Jury Prize for Position among the Stars. Leonard Retel Helmrich has served on the jury of many film festivals, including festivals in Shanghai, Warsaw, Seoul, Sibiu (Romania) and Amsterdam. He has had major retrospectives of his work at Visions du R√©el in Nyon, Switzerland, Rencontres Internationales du Documentaire in Montreal and at ASTRA in Sibiu, Romania. He has also lectured and screened his films at numerous educational institutions including the Flaherty Seminar Program in New York and at Harvard University where he was awarded a Fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies. Leonard shoots as well as directs all his own films and is best known for a philosophy and approach he calls ‚ÄòSingle Shot Cinema‚Äô, which involves long takes with a hand-held but smooth camera moving close to the subject. Above all, in his films, it is the framing and movement of the camera that captures and leads the emotions of the audience. He has taught numerous workshops on Single Shot Cinema techniques for film festivals, television broadcasters, independent filmmakers, film schools and universities in Europe, Asia, North America, Australia and in Africa. During his Harvard fellowship, he was editing his latest film Position Among the Stars, the third film of his trilogy on contemporary Indonesia. He is currently writing a book about ‚ÄúSingle Shot Cinema‚Äù. Single Shot Cinema Single Shot Cinema is a way of filming that enables one to shoot a scene in one single take using just one camera moving fluidly around the subject recording all the camera angles that express one's personal feeling and perception of that moment. The camera moves steadily and fluidly while constantly changing angles. The idea is to use fast and slow, high and low, close and far camera movements in a single shot within a scene. In this way, the camera movement itself becomes the primary cinematic expression. > \\"In ‚ÄúShape of the Moon‚Äù (2004) a barefoot man crosses a railroad trestle a > thousand feet above an Indonesian valley, stepping briskly along a beam > barely wider than his feet. We see him from behind. We see him from above. > Most alarming, we see him from the side, by means of a camera that seems > mounted in midair. It‚Äôs breathtaking, what the subject is doing. But a man > with a camera is doing it too.\\" John Anderson, The New York Times. He was inspired by the French film critic Andr√© Bazin whose ideas helped create the Nouvelle Vague films of Jean-Luc Godard and Fran√ßois Truffaut. According to Bazin, a moving camera is the essence of filmmaking: ‚ÄúIt should not cut up reality, but rather it should show reality in its temporal continuity.‚Äù Single Shot Cinema in documentary means catching real life moments while they are happening in one continuous shot with a camera that is moving around the subject. As a result, shots are not edited from one still moment to the next, but rather from one camera movement to the next. In practice this means that the camera movement must have a dramatic purpose. Ideally all footage shot should be usable for editing. In order to accomplish this, the filmmaker should always keep the center of attention within the camera frame. Bazin goes on to say that the camera must be equally prepared to move as to remain still. He describes camera movement in Italian Neorealism as having a human quality, as a projection of the hand and the eye, almost like a living part of the operator flowing directly from his awareness. > ‚ÄúHis camera glides through spaces in a way that just seems impossible... > Sometimes you stop looking at the movie and look at the shot. But I think > it‚Äôs delightful.\\" Robb Moss, film lecturer at Harvard.

The fort, the city and the district are all affixed with the name Bidar. Sultan Alla-Ud Din Bahman of the Bahmanid Dynasty shifted his capital from Gulbarga to Bidar in 1427 and built his fort along with a number of Islamic monuments. There are over 30 monuments inside Bidar fort. Geography Bidar city and fort are located on the edge of the Bidar plateau, the northernmost in Karnataka state. The plateau area, comprising low laterite hills, ends to the north at the Manjira River, a major tributary of the Godavari River. The Karanja River, a sub-tributary, drains the surrounding low-lying areas and feeds into the Manjiri River. Bidar district comprises the only part of the Godavari basin in Karnataka. Geologically, Bidar district is predominantly Deccan Trap with underlying layers of gneiss emerging along the eastern boundary. The plateau has an altitude of , and measures in length and in width at its broadest. The plateau encompasses a total area of . Bidar fort is built in the form of an irregular rhombus on the edge of the plateau with sheer walls built along the North and the East. The ancient capital Kalyani (Basavakalyan) of the Western Chalukya Empire is situated about to the west of Bidar. History Bidar fort was built by Ahmad Shah Wali Bahman; the exact layout of the old fort, with its double lines of defensive fortifications, is no longer discernible. Folklore suggests that the old fort was located in the western portion of the fort's present-day extent, from the Takht Mahal to the Kalmadgi gate and the promontory on which Virasangayya's temple was built, with the old water tank at the base of its walls. This is confirmed in historical record in Tarikh-i Firishta, by the Persian scholar Firishta (1560-1620 CE), which states that the Government House or Darul Imara, today known as Takht Mahal, was built on the site of the old fort. The old fort of Bidar was captured in 1321-22 AD by Prince Ulugh Khan of the Tughlaq dynasty, who later on became Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq of Delhi. With the establishment of the Bahmani Sultanate (1347), Bidar was occupied by Sultan Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah. During the rule of Ahmad Shah I (1422‚Äì1486), Bidar was made the capital city of Bahmani Kingdom. Under Ahmed Shah's rule, the old Fort was rebuilt, and beautiful madrasas, mosques, palaces and gardens were raised. Firishta records that the reconstruction began in 1429 CE and ended in 1432 CE. As gunpowder had not yet been introduced into peninsular India, long and winding fort walls were constructed out of stone and mortar by Persian and Turkish architects, the stone being provided from the moat, which was excavated by Hindu masons. Bidar fort was captured by the independent Bijapur Sultanate in 1619‚Äì20 but fell to then Mughal viceroy Aurangzeb in 1657, and was formally absorbed by the Mughal Empire in 1686. In 1724, Bidar became a part of the Asaf Jahi Kingdom of the Nizams. Nawab Mir Sa'id Muhammad Khan (also known as Salabath Jung), who was the third son of Asaf Jah I (the first Nizam of the dynasty), ruled from Bidar fort from 1751 to 1762, till his brother Mir Nizam Ali Khan, also known as Asaf Jah II, imprisoned him and later killed him in the fort on 16 September 1763. The old name for Bidar, \\"Mohammedabad\\" refers to the rule of Salabath Jung. In 1956, when the state of Hyderabad was partitioned, Bidar fort became part of the newly formed Mysore state (now Karnataka). Architecture The triple moat of Bidar fort. Large cannon in Bidar fort circa 1917 The present- day Bidar fortress was rebuilt using red laterite stone around the old fort in 1428 by Ahmed Shah Bahmani. Constructed on the edge of the plateau, Bidar fort has a haphazard rhombus-shaped layout. The fort is long by in breadth. The fort walls measure on the outside, and include within numerous buildings, arches, pavilions, mosques, gateways and gardens. To the north and east, steep cliffs provide natural protection to the moat and the glacis; elsewhere, facing Bidar city, from the south-east to the south-west, the walls are protected by a unique triple-channeled moat, described by Yazdani (1995) as follows: The seven gates of the fort are named from East to West as follows: * Gate 1 - The Mandu Darwaza, the main gate * Gate 2 - The Kalmadgi Darwaza, * Gate 5 - The Delhi Darwaza, * Gate 6 - The Kalyani Darwaza, * Gate 7 - The Carnatic Darwaza, * Gates 3 and 4 are without a name. There are 37 bastions on the fort wall, with cannon made of bars of metal welded together and held together by metal hoops were mounted on the bastions. The Munda Burj is the most prominent bastion, and the heaviest guns were placed here to dominate the approaches. Bidar fort has a number of monuments within the fortress complex. Prominent amongst them are the Rangin Mahal (\\"Painted Palace\\"), so called because of its elaborate decoration with coloured tiles; the Takht Mahal, or throne room; the Jami Masjid (\\"Great Mosque\\") and the Sola Khamba Masjid (\\"Sixteen-Pillar\\" mosque). With the establishment of the Bahmani Kingdom in the Deccan from 1347, the architectural styles of the Persian architecture of Iran made impressive and lasting impacts, which are seen in the Bidar Fort. The mosques, arches, gardens and the palaces were built within and also outside the fort in the Bidar city. Some of the important structures built are elaborated. Innovative systems of water management are seen in and around the fort and city of Bidar.Sohoni, Pushkar and Klaus R√∂tzer, ‚ÄòNature, Dams, Wells and Gardens: The Route of Water in and around Bidar‚Äô in Daud Ali and Emma Flatt (ed.), Garden and Landscape Practices in Pre-Colonial India (New Delhi: Routledge, 2011), pp. 54-73. The influence of Persian culture was distinct in Bidar in the Deccan, during 15th and 16th centuries. Karez water supply system Entrance to the Karez system in Bidar One of the most unusual features of Bidar is the historic water supply system, called karez, (also known as qanat), which is a water harnessing technology that originated in Persia. The technology was brought to the Deccan by the Bahmani kings of the 15th Century CE, the karez system was built by Bahmani kings in 15th Century in Naubad village in Bidar, in Gulbarga and Bijapur districts in Karnataka and also in Burhanpur district in Madhya Pradesh. The karez consists basically of a network underground canals, punctuated by vertical shafts to the surface, The karez taps into the groundwater sources (or natural springs) and transports it through the tunnel to the settlement, ending in a surface canal and/or pools in the village for various uses like drinking, washing, ablution, watering livestock, and also further used for irrigating fields, orchards and gardens. The rocky soil in Bidar makes access to drinking water very difficult and the karez was built in order to provide drinking water to civilian settlements and the garrison inside the Bidar fort. The system in Bidar has 21 vertical shafts, and extends for about . A few karez shafts have been closed by builders and developers, leaving only 17 visible today.

The film was directed by Rick Rubin and stars the hip-hop group Run‚ÄìD.M.C. They created the film to coincide with the release of their fourth studio album also titled Tougher Than Leather. Plot At the beginning of the film, D.M.C. is released from jail, at which time he returns to New York City with his band-mates, Run and Jam Master Jay. They are ready to schedule some gigs and kick-start their musical careers when things take a dark turn. Their friend Runny Ray, played by Raymond White, has been murdered by Vic Ferrante (Rick Rubin); this pulls the group into a seedy world of crime and violence. Vic and the police cover up the murder to look like Ray died from drugs, As they attempt to determine who is responsible for the murder, their own lives become endangered. They take matters into their own hands trying to find Ray's killer. However, the action is balanced with a series of musical performances by the stars and other late 1980s hip-hop stars including Slick Rick and Beastie Boys.

Connections to Blaxploitation In response to the negative reactions to the film, critics like Randall Clark have pointed out the many connections between the movie and the history of the \\"Blaxploitation\\" genre. Much like earlier films such as Shaft and Black Samson, the plot features inner-city anti-heroes who need to take the law into their own hands as they have been neglected by the more traditional avenues of justice.Clark, Randall.

The decision is notable for combining the reasonableness (simpliciter) and patent unreasonableness standards of review into a single reasonableness standard. Facts David Dunsmuir was hired by the Department of Justice of the Province of New Brunswick as of February 25, 2002. His work was unsatisfactory to his employer and he received multiple written notices to this effect. Ultimately, his employer decided to terminate his employment as of December 31, 2004. On August 19, 2004, Dunsmuir was informed in a letter that his employment was being terminated. As his employment was not being terminated 'for cause', Dunsmuir was granted several months of paid leave with which to find a new job. Dunsmuir grieved his dismissal in a letter sent to the Deputy Minister on September 1, 2004. When his grievance was denied, he gave notice that he would refer the grievance to adjudication. An adjudicator was selected by the agreement of both parties. The adjudicator held that Dunsmuir had been denied procedural fairness in the manner of his dismissal and that the dismissal was thus void ab initio; the adjudicator ordered Dunsmuir to be reinstated as of August 19, 2004. On judicial review to the Court of Queen's Bench, the decision was overturned.Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, para. 70. That decision eventually reached the Supreme Court of Canada. History Trial Court The trial court took an application for judicial review and said the correct standard of review is correctness against the adjudicator's decision because the adjudicator did not have jurisdiction to inquire. It said that Dunsmuir received procedural fairness because of the hearing before the adjudicator and maintained the 8 month decision. Court of Appeal The Court of Appeal said that reasonableness was the correct standard and that the adjudicator was unreasonable because the employer dismissed the employee at pleasure, and that the common law rules did not require any more procedural fairness than Dunsmuir received. Reasons of the Court (SCC) Statement of the Law The Court began by canvassing the recent history of administrative law decisions on the standard of review, including Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 963 v New Brunswick Liquor Corp, Crevier v Quebec (AG), Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) v Southam Inc and Pushpanathan v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration). The court noted the general unworkability of the current state of the judicial review of administrative decisions in Canada. In response, the court decided to dispense with having three standards of review (correctness, reasonableness (simpliciter), and patent unreasonableness). Instead, the court decided that henceforth there shall be only two standards: correctness and reasonableness. Additionally, the decision to apply a correctness standard will no longer be based on 'jurisdictional' issues. The court emphasized the use of precedent to simplify the issue of standard of review. First, courts must ascertain whether the jurisprudence has already determined in a satisfactory manner the degree of deference to be accorded with regard to a particular category of question. Second, where the first inquiry proves unfruitful, courts must proceed to an analysis of the factors making it possible to identify the proper standard of review.Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 SCR 190 at para 62. The following matters were identified as being subject to the correctness standard:Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 SCR 190 at paras 57‚Äì61. Application to the facts When this new analytical framework was applied to the facts of Dunsmuir, the court determined that the reasonableness standard was the correct approach on which to judge the administrative decision in question. In that regard, the court ruled that the decision failed to meet this standard and was therefore unreasonable.Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, para. 69. Impact The ruling has consolidated the law relating to standards of judicial review in Canada, and has effectively required a full standard of review analysis to be performed in all current disputes arising from administrative decisions. Dunsmuir does not stand for the proposition that the \\"adequacy\\" of reasons is a stand‚Äëalone basis for quashing a decision, or as advocating that a reviewing court undertake two discrete analyses ‚Äì one for the reasons and a separate one for the result. It is a more organic exercise ‚Äì the reasons must be read together with the outcome and serve the purpose of showing whether the result falls within a range of possible outcomes. The Dunsmuir principles were subsequently clarified in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Khosa, where Binnie J commented, However, Dunsmuir will not overrule specific requirements that are given in a statutory framework - therefore, the duty of procedural fairness will continue to apply in such cases. The presumption of reasonableness in administrative review suggested by Binnie J in Dunsmuir did not find majority support at the time, but has since been accepted by the Supreme Court in other cases. This presumption of reasonableness has since led to a more deferent view being taken by courts in Canada when reviewing administrative decisions. In addition, the ruling has effectively ensured that most forms of public employment are best viewed through the lens of private employment law principles, irrespective of whether the affected person may be categorized as a public office holder. Therefore, appeals on grounds of procedural fairness will be available only to a few categories of public employment, and reinstatement procedures will occur even less frequently. In June 2018, the Supreme Court found that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal's determination that the Indian Act did not violate the Canadian Human Rights Act was reasonable. Three concurring justices argued that the context instead required review for correctness..

He's a white horse, wearing a red cowboy hat and light blue bandana. He was voiced by Daws Butler. All 45 of his cartoons that originally aired between 1959 and 1961 were written by Michael Maltese, known best for his work at the Warner Bros. cartoon studio. The cartoon was nominated for an Emmy Award in 1960.  Character description  Quick Draw was usually depicted as a sheriff in a series of short films set in the Old West. Quick Draw was often accompanied by his deputy, a Mexican burro called Baba Looey (also voiced by Daws Butler), who spoke English with a Mexican accent and called his partner \\"Queeks Draw\\". In the Spanish American version, Quick Draw (Tiro Loco McGraw) speaks in a very English-influenced accent, and Baba Looey (Pepe Trueno, or Pepe Luis in some episodes) speaks in a very Mexican accent, so it was clear that Quick Draw was the alien, and there was no need to adapt any feature of the story. In the Brazilian version, however, Quick Draw speaks in a drawling Portuguese which along with his hispanized name (Pepe Legal) would suggest he was either a Texan-American or Mexican cowboy. Quick Draw satirized the westerns that were popular among the American public at the time. His character was well-intentioned, but somewhat dim. His main catchphrases were \\"Now hold on there!\\" and \\"I'll do the 'thin'in' around here and don't you forget it!\\" Also if he got hurt he would often say \\"Ooooh that smarts!\\" Another featured character was Snuffles, the bloodhound dog that would point to his mouth and \\"ah-ah-ah-\\" when he wanted a biscuit, then hug himself, leap up in the air, and float back down after having eaten one. In several cases when Quick Draw did not have a dog biscuit to offer, or if he tried to give Snuffles the reward cash for capturing an outlaw, Snuffles would either shake his head and say \\"Uh-uh\\" or grunt to himself and mumble \\"Darn cheapskate!\\" as well as sometimes throwing the reward money back in Quick Draw's face.  Personality  Quick Draw was himself a horse caricature that walked on two legs like a human (as did Baba Looey), and had \\"hands\\" that were hooves with thumbs and could hold objects such as guns. This did not stop the show's producers from depicting him riding into town on a realistic horse, or as seen in the show's opening credits, driving a stagecoach pulled by a whole team of realistic horses. This aspect was made light of in the 1980s made-for-television film The Good, the Bad, and Huckleberry Hound, which featured Quick Draw.  El Kabong  El Kabong swinging to the rescue. In certain cases, Quick Draw would also assume the identity of the masked vigilante El Kabong (a spoof of Zorro). His introduction went as follows ‚Äì \\"Of all the heroes in legend and song, there's none as brave as El Kabong\\". As El Kabong, Quick Draw would attack his foes by swooping down on a rope with the war cry \\"OL√â!\\" and hitting them on the head with an acoustic guitar (after shouting \\"KABOOOOOONG!\\"), which is always referred to as a \\"kabonger\\", producing a distinctive kabong sound and usually destroying the guitar in the process. The \\"guitar\\" was usually drawn as a four strung quatro. On the cartoon's soundtrack, the \\"kabong\\" sound effect was produced by a foley artist striking the detuned open strings of a cheap acoustic guitar. Comedian Kenny Moore received the nickname of El Kabong on some web sites due to his infamous assault of a heckler with the guitar he played as part of his act.  Guest appearances in other media  * Quick Draw McGraw occasionally appeared in other Hanna-Barbera productions, including 1973's Yogi's Gang, 1977‚Äì1978's Laff-a-Lympics, a celebrity roast honoring Fred Flintstone on the TV special Hanna-Barbera's All-Star Comedy Ice Revue (1978) and the 1979 TV special Casper's First Christmas, and in an episode from the short-lived 1978 series Yogi's Space Race. * Quick Draw McGraw and Baba Looey appeared in The Yogi Bear Show episode \\"Yogi's Birthday Party\\". * In the \\"Fender Bender 500\\" segment of 1990's Wake, Rattle, and Roll, Quick Draw McGraw and Baba Looey are the featured racers where they drive a padded wagon-modeled monster truck called the Texas Twister.

History Lalgarh movement The Lalgarh movement started attracting attention after the failed assassination attempt on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, then chief minister of West Bengal, in the Salboni area, on 2 November 2008 and the police action that followed. The movement was not just a political struggle but an armed struggle that concurrently took the look of a social struggle. A large nuber of CPI(M) activists, and others active in different political parties, were killed. Although the epi-centre of the movement was Lalgarh, it was spread across 19 police stations in three adjoining districts ‚Äì Paschim Medinipur, Bankura and Purulia, all thickly forested and near the border with Jharkhand. The deployment of CRPF and other forces started on 11 June 2009. The movement came to an end after the 2011 state assembly elections and change of government in West Bengal.

The episode premiered on the Fox network on December 2, 2009. It was written by series creator Ryan Murphy and directed by Elodie Keene. In \\"Mattress\\", the glee club discovers that they are going to be omitted from the school yearbook. Club member Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) has the team cast in a local mattress commercial in an attempt to raise their social status. Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) discovers that his wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) has been faking her pregnancy. The episode features cover versions of four songs, studio recordings of three of which were released as singles, available for digital download, and are also included on the album Glee: The Music, Volume 2. \\"Mattress\\" was watched by 8.15 million US viewers, Glee series high at that point. It received mixed reviews from critics. The conclusion of the fake pregnancy storyline attracted praise, as did Gilsig and Morrison's acting, however Liz Pardue of Zap2it expressed dismay that so few songs were performed, while Raymund Flandez of the Wall Street Journal deemed \\"Jump\\" \\"the only memorable song of the episode\\". Plot Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) convinces Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) not to include a photograph of the glee club in the school yearbook, as in previous years, glee club photographs have been heavily defaced in the library copy of the yearbook by fellow students. Club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) personally buys a meager section of advertising space in the book so that a photograph featuring at least two members can be included. Fearing unpopularity, the club nominates Rachel (Lea Michele) to represent them in the photograph. Rachel convinces Finn (Cory Monteith) to appear alongside her, but after being teased by his peers, he drops out. When it transpires that the school photographer (John Ross Bowie) is soon to direct a commercial for his brother-in-law, a local mattress store owner, Rachel convinces him to cast the glee club in it, believing that local celebrity status will prevent the other students from mocking them. Will is dismayed to learn that his close friend, guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), has arranged to marry her fianc√©, football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher), on the same day the glee club will compete at sectionals. Will goes on to discover that his wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) has been lying to him for months about her supposed pregnancy. She actually experienced a hysterical pregnancy and hid the truth from him for several months by wearing a pregnancy pad under her clothes, while planning to secretly adopt Quinn's (Dianna Agron) baby. Will walks out on her and spends the night at the school, sleeping on one of the mattresses given to the glee club in payment for their commercial. Sue informs Will that the club receiving payment for the commercial revokes their amateur status, and thus their eligibility to compete at sectionals. Quinn, who has been trying to convince Sue to let her appear in the cheerleaders' photographs despite being removed from the team due to her pregnancy, reminds Sue that as their coach she has often given the cheerleaders perks which would also render them ineligible for competition. She demands that Sue sacrifice one of the cheerleaders' six pages in the yearbook to the glee club. Sue agrees, and accepts Quinn back onto the cheerleading team, but Quinn tells her she no longer wishes to be a cheerleader. Will announces that he will not be accompanying the club to sectionals, as he was the one who accepted payment, and as such they will only be allowed to compete without his involvement. The glee club then has their group photograph taken for the yearbook, but the copy in the library is subsequently defaced by hockey player Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) and football player Azimio (James Earl). Production \\"Mattress\\" was written by series creator Ryan Murphy and directed by Elodie Keene. Recurring characters who appear in the episode are glee club members Brittany (Heather Morris), Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) and Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton), Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher), local news anchors Rod Remington (Bill A. Jones) and Andrea Carmichael (Earlene Davis), hockey player Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) and football player Azimio (James Earl). John Ross Bowie guest-stars as school photographer Dennis, and Chuck Spitler plays his brother-in-law, mattress store owner Randy Cusperberg. The episode features cover versions of \\"Smile\\" by Lily Allen, \\"Jump\\" by Van Halen, \\"Smile\\" by Charlie Chaplin, and \\"When You're Smiling\\" by Louis Armstrong. Studio recordings of each of the songs except \\"When You're Smiling\\" were released as singles, available for digital download, and are also included on the album Glee: The Music, Volume 2. Jenna Ushkowitz deemed \\"Jump\\" one of her favorite songs on the album, explaining that it was fun to perform on mattresses and comparing it to \\"Proud Mary\\", performed in the episode \\"Wheels\\", which utilized wheelchairs as props. Jessalyn Gilsig referred to the confrontation between Terri and Will in \\"Mattress\\" as \\"The Reckoning\\". She described it as sad to shoot, as she and Morrison were so invested in the storyline, and explained: \\"What I hope is conveyed is that you see the child inside Terri. You see the fear.\\" Gilsig commented that viewers had been wondering why Will was taking so long to discover Terri was not actually pregnant, explaining: \\"I think people have been asking 'How slow is this guy?!'. But [in \\"Mattress\\"] Will finally reflects that he is a fully evolved human being and puts two and two together.\\" She noted that while Will and Emma \\"are adorable together\\", she still believes in Terri and Will as a couple as: \\"I think that she really loves him. People do crazy things out of deep, deep insecurity. She's obviously flawed, but I think she has love in her heart.\\" While fan reaction to her character had previously resulted in a backlash Gilsig found \\"tough\\", she hoped that \\"Mattress\\" would be the episode in which \\"anti-Terri fans joined Team Terri\\". Reception Critics were pleased to see Gilsig's fake pregnancy storyline conclude. \\"Mattress\\" was watched by 8.15 million US viewers, Glee series high in the 2009‚Äì10 television season at the time of its original broadcast. It achieved a 3.6/10 rating/share in the 18-49 demographic, again the show's season high at the time, and a 4.3/12 rating/share with adults 18-34, both its series high and the highest rating in the demographic for the night of broadcast. In Canada, it was the ninth most watched show for the week of broadcast, attaining 1.8 million viewers. The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Entertainment Weekly Dan Snierson wrote that \\"Mattress\\" \\"felt like a step forward after last week's all-over- the-place hair toss\\", and called the \\"poignant\\" ending \\"one of Glee best\\". In contrast, Mike Hale of the New York Times wrote that with \\"Mattress\\", Glee appeared to be \\"taking a break\\" ahead of the midseason finale episode \\"Sectionals\\". Liz Pardue of Zap2it was relieved that \\"Mattress\\" brought the fake pregnancy storyline to an end. She noted, however, that she was still unsatisfied with the episode, as the conclusion to the storyline should have come sooner, and there were too few songs featured. Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle called the episode \\"pretty good\\" noting that he \\"wasn't crazy about any of the songs\\" but enjoyed the plot development, particularly the confrontation between Terri and Will. Raymund Flandez of the Wall Street Journal was happy to see the \\"convoluted\\" fake pregnancy storyline end, and called the performance of \\"Jump\\" \\"lively\\" and the stunts \\"incredible\\", though he wrote that it was \\"the only memorable song of the episode\\". Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times noted that in previous reviews, he had \\"never been shy of [his] disdain for Mrs. Schuester\\", but that his hatred of Terri \\"vanished\\" once the lie was over, praising the confrontation between Will and Terri. MTV Aly Semigran praised both actors, especially \\"a devastated Matthew Morrison\\" for having \\"nailed just what a scary, sad, and life-altering moment\\" it was. She deemed \\"Jump\\" both \\"delightful\\" and the \\"giddiest musical number on the show to date\\".

Early career Espinoza Paz (Isidro Chavez Espinoza) was born on 29 October 1981 in La Angostura, a small town in the north of the state of Sinaloa, Mexico. He was 11 years old when he wrote his first song, which was dedicated to a girl with whom he had a crush. By the time he was 13, he had already written 20 songs; however, it wasn‚Äôt until his father sent him money from the United States that he decided to buy his first guitar and teach himself to play it. In 1996, he emigrated to Sacramento, California, where his love for music grew while he earned a living washing tomatoes and picking oranges, olives and grapes in Dixon, California. Several months later, he decided to return to Mexico, where he suffered the hardest experience of his life: the passing of his mother, Mrs. Maria de la Paz Espinoza. From that point on, Paz embarked on what seemed like a never-ending journey to become a successful musician. He returned to the United States and worked as a gardener in Oregon for about a year. Tired of traveling, he then decided to concentrate on his career as a songwriter, and being convinced of his calling, he returned to Mexico once again. His \\"muse\\" was a friend from California, Daniel Sheree Kent. Their platonic relationship inspired many of his songs. For the next eight years, he knocked on doors and sang in regional bands, always looking for \\"the opportunity\\" as he poured his feelings and experiences into his songs. Success Espinoza Paz His big break came when he showed some of his creations to El Coyote‚Äîa popular Sinaloan banda singer‚Äîwho recorded his songs \\"Besitos En El Cuello\\" (\\"Little Kisses On The Neck\\"); \\"Prohibido\\" (\\"Forbidden\\"); and \\"Para Impresionarte\\" (\\"To Impress You\\"), all of which immediately became hits. Espinoza Paz in 2010. In December 2006, Paz met Martin Fabian, a well-known personality within the radio and music industry, who immediately foresaw the extraordinary talent within the young singer- songwriter. They soon began collaborating on his debut album \\"Paz En Tu Coraz√≥n\\" (literally, \\"Peace In Your Heart\\"‚Äîthe title being a wordplay on his name). This project was released in 2007 in association with Nueva Generacion Music Group. Another independently released album, \\"Amigo Con Derechos\\" (\\"Friend With Benefits\\"), followed in 2008 before Paz was offered a recording contract with the major label Universal Latino, which released his first major label album \\"El Canta Autor del Pueblo\\" (\\"The Village Singer-Songwriter\\") in 2008 on its Machete Music subsidiary. This album featured eight previously released favorites such as \\"El Celular\\" (\\"The Cell Phone\\") and \\"Amigo con Derechos\\" (\\"Friend With Benefits\\") plus four new recordings. The single from this album, \\"El Proximo Viernes\\" (\\"Next Friday\\") reached #14 on Billboard Magazine's \\"Hot Latin Tracks\\" chart. Soon Paz was penning songs for a long list of regional Regional artists, including Sergio Vega, La Arrolladora Banda El Lim√≥n, Banda Cuisillos, Julio Chaidez, Banda de Jerez, Jenni Rivera, Chuy Lizarraga, Adair Elizalde, El Potro de Sinaloa, Calibre 50, Montez de Durango, Juli√≥n √Ålvarez, El Chapo de Sinaloa, and Duelo, among numerous others. In 2010 he released the album \\"Del Rancho Para El Mundo\\" which included the smash hit \\"Al Diablo Lo Nuestro\\". The album was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award and was certified Gold. In 2011 he released another Gold selling album: \\"Canciones Que Duelen\\". This album debuted at #1 on the Billboard Latin Albums Chart and included the hit single \\"Para No Perderte\\". The album was also released in a deluxe version with a DVD containing several live performances. In 2012 he released \\"Un Hombre Normal\\", a compilation album featuring some of his biggest hits, remixes and several new recordings. The title track would eventually reach #1 on the Latin Charts. During this time Paz decided to release an album of all Mariachi songs with the group Mariachi Sol De Mexico. The album which was originally titled \\"Las Facturas del Destino\\" was re-titled and was not released until 2016. Brief Retirement In 2012, Paz shocked fans by saying he was going to retire, after a lawsuit from his former manager. In early 2014, he switched labels from \\"Nueva Generacion Music Group\\" to \\"Anval Music\\". During this time, Paz's popularity began to decline and although he released numerous singles, he did not release a studio album until 2016.

Originally, the region of Argyll was served by the sheriff of Perth, however in 1326, king Robert I appointed his step- nephew-in-law, Dougal Campbell, to the newly created position of sheriff of Argyll; Dougall was the son of Neil Campbell, whose second wife was Robert's sister, Mary. The traditional stronghold of the Campbells was in the centre of the Argyll region, and Robert had wished to reward the Campbells for their service in his successful usurpation of king John Balliol. Though named sheriff of Argyll the position was initially limited to Lorn, but expanded in later centuries. In 1633, the sheriff of Argyll newly acquired authority over Kintyre and Knapdale, which had previously been under the sheriff of Tarbert. Prior to 1748 most sheriffdoms were held on a hereditary basis. From that date, following the Jacobite uprising of 1745, the hereditary sheriffs were replaced by salaried sheriff-deputes, qualified advocates who were members of the Scottish Bar. The post of sheriff of Argyll continued in existence until 1948, when it was amalgamated with the sheriffdom of Renfrew to form the position of Sheriff of Renfrew and Argyll.

This article covers sovereignty transitions relating to the Philippines, with particular emphasis on the passing of sovereignty from Spain to the United States in the Treaty of Paris (1898), signed on December 10, 1898 to end the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. US President William McKinley asserted the United States' sovereignty over the Philippines on December 21, 1898 through his Benevolent Assimilation Proclamation. In March 1897, Emilio Aguinaldo, a member of the Katipunan, was elected as president of a revolutionary government established after the Tejeros Convention. That government was supposedly meant to replace the Katipunan, though the latter was not formally abolished until 1899. Aguinaldo was again elected as president at Biak-na-Bato in November 1897, leading the Biak-na-Bato Republic. Exiled in Hong Kong after the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, he returned to the Philippines to renew revolutionary activities with the advent of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and, in May 1898, formed a dictatorial government. In June 1898, Aguinaldo proclaimed independence from Spanish sovereignty and transformed his dictatorial government into a revolutionary government. On January 22, 1899 (subsequent to the signing of the Treaty of Paris) Aguinaldo's government was constituted by the Malolos Congress and is called the Malolos Republic as well as the First Philippine Republic (). Aguinaldo was again elected president in January 1899, and attempted unsuccessfully to persuade other countries to recognize his nascent government. Following the outbreak of general hostilities between U.S. and Filipino forces in February 1899, the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War ensued. Aguinaldo's government effectively ceased to exist on April 1, 1901, when he pledged allegiance to the United States after being captured by U.S. forces in March of that year. The Philippines continued as a U.S. territory until July 4, 1946, when the U.S. relinquished sovereignty and recognized the independence of the Republic of the Philippines. The current Philippine government considers Emilio Aguinaldo to have been the first President of the Philippines and considers the Malolos Republic as the \\"First\\" Philippine Republic.Philippine Presidents, The Official Government Portal of the Republic of the Philippines. Sovereignty Sovereignty is the quality of having supreme, independent authority over a territory. It can be found in a power to rule and make law that rests on a political fact for which no purely legal explanation can be provided. A sovereign state is a political association with effective internal and external sovereignty over a geographic area and population which is not dependent on, or subject to any other power or state. As a practical matter, the question of sovereignty for the Philippines did not arise until near the end of the 19th century. The constitutive theory of statehood was developed in the 19th century to define what is and is not a state. With this theory, statehood depends on an entity's recognition by other countries. Spanish period Early contact The first well documented arrival of western Europeans in the archipelago was the Spanish expedition led by Portuguese-born Spanish explorer Ferdinand Magellan, which first sighted the mountains of Samar at dawn on 16 March 1521 (Spanish calendar). Magellan sought friendship among the natives beginning with Humabon, the chieftain of Sugbu (now Cebu), and took special pride in converting them to Catholicism. His involvement with the native tribes eventually led to his death on 27 April 1521 in the Battle of Mactan. After Magellan's voyage, subsequent Spanish expeditions were dispatched to the islands and, in 1543, Ruy L√≥pez de Villalobos named the islands of Leyte and Samar Las Islas Filipinas after Philip II of Spain. The single surviving vessel from Magellan's fleet, the Victoria, returned to Spain in 1522, after which Spain claimed dominion over the Philippine archipelago on the basis of discovery, a valid mode of acquisition at the time. Spanish conquest On April 27, 1565, Spanish Conquistadores attacked the defiant Rajah Tupas, who had succeeded Rajah Humabon as king of Cebu.Jovito Abellana, Aginid, Bayok sa Atong Tawarik, 1952 Tupas was defeated and made to sign an agreement after his defeat, effectively placing the Philippines under Spain. On February 8, 1597, King Philip II, near the end of his 42-year reign, issued a Royal Cedula instructing to Francisco de Tello de Guzm√°n, then Governor- General of the Philippines in severe terms to fulfill the laws of tributes and to provide for restitution of ill-gotten taxes imposed on the natives. The Cedula also decreed an undertaking by which the natives (referred to as Indians), \\"... freely render to me submission.\\" The decree was published in Manila on August 5, 1598. King Philip died on September 13, just forty days after the publication of the decree, but his death was not known in the Philippines until middle of 1599, by which time a referendum by which the natives would acknowledge Spanish rule was underway. With the completion of the Philippine referendum of 1599, Spain could be said to have established legitimate sovereignty over the Philippines. Spanish rule During Spain's 333-year rule in the Philippines, the colonists had to fight off the Chinese pirates (who lay siege to Manila, the most famous of which was Limahong in 1574), Dutch forces, and Portuguese forces. Moros from western Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago constantly raided the coastal Christian areas of Luzon and the Visayas and occasionally brought home loot and fair women. They often sold their captives as slaves. A British conquest of the Spanish Philippines occurred during the Seven Years' War, with British occupation of the capital between 1762 and 1764. Also, there were a number of failed Philippine revolts during Spanish rule. The Katipunan On July 7, 1892, the Filipino writer Jos√© Rizal was exiled to Dapitan, Andr√©s Bonifacio, Teodoro Plata, Ladislao Diwa, and others founded the Katipunan, a secret organization opposed to Spanish rule. Its discovery in 1896 by the Spanish colonial government led to the outbreak of Philippine Revolution. An article on the website of the Philippine Government's National Commission for Culture and the Arts asserts that the Katipunan became an \\"open de facto government\\" on August 24, 1896.Andres Bonifacio and the 1896 Revolution, Philippine National Commission on culture and the Arts. Emilio Aguinaldo wrote that the Cabinet conferred on Bonifacio the title Haring Bayan (Sovereign). Filipino historian Gregario Zaide also wrote that the Katipunan was a government by itself.. However, the Katipunan were not recognized by other countries as the legitimate government of the Philippines. At the Tejeros Convention held by the Katipunan on March 22, 1897, Emilio Aguinaldo was elected to the office of President.. Bonifacio, as chairman of the convention and Supremo of the Katipunan, voided the convention proceedings, but Aguinaldo (who had not been present at the convention) took his oath of office as President the next day in Santa Cruz de Malabon (present-day Tanza) in Cavite. On November 1, 1897, a constitution written by Felix Ferrer and Isabelo Archero established the Republic of Biak- na-Bato, with Aguinaldo as President. On December 14‚Äì15, 1897, the Pact of Biak-na-Bato suspended the revolution, with Aguinaldo and other Katipunan leaders agreeing to go into voluntary exile abroad. General Francisco Makabulos of Tarlac, a Katipunan leader who did not go into exile, established the Central Executive Committee, which was intended to be a provisional government \\"until a general government in these islands shall again be established.\\" This rebel government had a constitution, popularly called the constitution of Makabulos, which provided for an executive committee composed of a President, Vice President and Secretary of the Interior. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War period American hostilities, Aguinaldo's return, Dictatorial government After the Philippines became a theater of operations in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, with hostilities commencing on May 1, 1898 with the Battle of Manila Bay, Aguinaldo and others returned from exile to the Philippines in order to resume their revolution against the Spanish colonial government. On May 24, in the wake of his military victories, Aguinaldo announced that he was assuming \\"command of all the troops in the struggle for the attainment of our lofty aspirations, inaugurating a dictatorial government to be administered by decrees promulgated under my sole responsibility...\\". On June 18, he issued a decree formally establishing a Dictatorial Government. This was done under the authority of the Biak-na-Bato republic, nullifying orders issued prior to the signing of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato and asserting that the Dictatorial Government was temporary in nature, \\"... so that, when peace shall have been reestablished and our legitimate aspiration for unrestricted liberty attained, it may be modified by the nation, in which rests the principle of authority.\\", citing Philippine declaration of independence, Revolutionary government On June 12, 1898, the Philippine Declaration of Independence was proclaimed at an event led by Emilio Aguinaldo in his mansion in Kawit, Cavite (this proclamation did not address the de jure status of the Spanish colonial government, which continued to exist under the Spanish national government then embroiled in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War). On June 23, Aguinaldo issued a decree replacing the Dictatorial Government with a Revolutionary Government. Appendix C Peace protocol, U.S. military government, Treaty of Paris On July 24, 1898, the Spanish Peninsular Government had replaced Governor-General Basilio August√≠n with Ferm√≠n J√°udens (acting). On August 13, 1898, J√°udens was replaced by Francisco Rizzo (acting), who was replaced in September 1898 by Diego de los R√≠os (acting).. On August 13, with American commanders unaware that a peace protocol had been signed in Washington, D.C. between Spain and the United States on the previous day, American forces captured the city of Manila from the Spanish. The next day, August 14, U.S. military government was established with Major General Wesley Merritt as the first military governor. General Merritt received news of the August 12 peace protocol on August 16, three days after the surrender of Manila. Ch.10 In early December 1898, General Rios moved the Spanish Philippine capital from Manila to Iloilo. On December 24, Rios and the Spanish garrison departed Iloilo after being driven out by local revolutionaries. By December 28, Spanish troops had evacuated all garrisons in the south Philippines except Zamboanga and Jolo. Initially, Rios relocated the Spanish capital to Zamboanga, but on January 1 or 2, 1899, he relocated it again, this time back to Manila, where he could more effectively seek the release of Spanish POWs. On January 4, 1899, U.S. General Elwell Otis issued a proclamation announcing that the United States had obtained possession and control of all of the Philippines from the Spanish.. As a consequence of its defeat, Spain transferred its rights over the Philippine archipelago to the U.S., with the Philippines ceasing to be a colony of Spain and becoming a colony of the U.S. On December 10, 1898, the Treaty of Paris was signed between Spain and the United States, ending the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. In article III of this treaty, Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States.\\"Spain cedes to the United States the archipelago known as the Philippine Islands, and comprehending the islands lying within the following line: ...\\" (precise geographic description elided). The United States will pay to Spain the sum of twenty million dollars ($20,000,000) within three months after the exchange of the ratifications of the present treaty\\", Felipe Agoncillo, who had been assigned by Aguinaldo as Ambassador to the United States, had traveled to Paris but had been refused admission to the conference. He worked hard to prevent the ratification of the treaty by Spain, but failed. Returning to Paris, he sent a message to Aguinaldo about the refusal of the United States and other foreign powers to recognize the independence of the Philippines. During the entire time that the Filipino revolutionary movement developed as described above, first under Bonifacio and later under Makabulos and Aguinaldo, the Philippines was under Spanish sovereignty., \\"Spain claimed dominion over the Philippine archipelago on the basis of discovery, a valid mode of acquisition at the time. [...] The Philippines remained a crown colony of Spain for over three centuries. Spain relinquished title over the Philippine islands in the aftermath of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, when the U.S. emerged as the victor. The Treaty of Paris was signed in Paris on December 10, 1898, which ceded the archipelago to the U.S.\\" The Filipino revolutionary movement was an insurgency against the Spanish colonial government,Wiktionary definition: \\": 1. ; ; the state of being \\". and the various \\"governments\\" described above were insurgent governments. By today's standards, a treaty of cession is void if it arises out of an act of annexation procured by the threat or use of force. Although the 1898 annexation of the Philippines by the U.S. would arguably have been unlawful by today's standards, it does not follow that the U.S. claims of sovereignty are unfounded. Under the doctrine of intertemporal law, \\"a juridical fact must be appreciated in light of the law contemporary with it, and not the law in force at the time when a dispute in regard to it arises or falls to be settled.\\" Thus, the legality of any act should be determined in accordance with the law of the time the act was committed, and not by reference to law as it might have become at a later date. By the Westphalian sovereignty standards of the late 19th century, the cessation of these territories by Spain to the U.S. was valid., \\"... Even if its title was challenged, the U.S. could rely on the international character of the cession of Philippines territory from Spain. First, Spain's claim of title rests on the theory of territorium nullius. Second, the massive military victories of the U.S. over the nativist resistance allow the U.S. to claim legal title on the basis of conquest. However, there was no need to raise these alternative theories; \\"[i]t was simply assumed, without question, that the Spanish cession was valid and that it applied to all parts of the colony.\\" Citing Teodoro A.

Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War period U.S. military government On August 14, 1898, following the August 12 capture of Manila, the U.S. had established a military government in the Philippines under General Merritt as military governor. During military rule (1898‚Äì1901), the U.S. military commander governed the Philippines under the authority of the U.S. president as commander-in-chief of the U.S. armed forces. General Otis succeeded General Merritt as military governor, governing from 1898 to 1900. General Otis was succeeded by General MacArthur, who governed from 1900 to 1901. Ch.21 Dictatorial and Revolutionary governments On June 18, 1898, Aguinaldo proclaimed a Dictatorial government. Five days later, on June 23, he issued a decree changing its character to a revolutionary government. After proclaiming his revolutionary government, Aguinaldo created diplomatic positions abroad in order to persuade foreign powers to recognize Philippine independence and promulgated decrees creating committees abroad for the purpose of carrying on propaganda activities. He issued decrees on June 24 and August 10 establishing the Hongkong Junta whose members were to represent the Philippines in different countries. A August 24 decree created a revolutionary committee in foreign countries. Diplomatic agents were appointed for the U.S., Japan, England, France, and Australia. The Paris Committee and Madrid Committee were created to work for the recognition of Philippine independence by France and Spain. First Philippine Republic On January 22, 1899, the promulgation of the Malolos Constitution replaced Aguinaldo's insurgent revolutionary government with the First Philippine Republic; also an insurgent government, but insurgent against the United States instead of against Spain. Felipe Agoncillo went to the U.S. to work for American recognition and secured an audience with U.S. President William McKinley, but only with the understanding was received as a private citizen and not as a representative of Aguinaldo. He sailed to Europe to appeal to the American Peace Commissioners there to negotiate the Treaty of Paris, but failed in this as well. He returned to the U.S. to fight the ratification of the treaty. On February 4, 1899, with Agoncillo in the U.S., general hostilities erupted between U.S. and Filipino forces, beginning what later came to be known as the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. With the eruption of hostilities, Agoncillo fled the U.S. That same day, Aguinaldo issued an order commanding \\"... That peace and friendly relations with the Americans be broken and that the latter be treated as enemies, ...\\" On March 30, U.S. Forces captured Malolos, Bulacan, which had been the seat of Aguinaldo's various governments. Meanwhile, Aguinaldo had evacuated and established new headquarters in San Isidro, Nueva Ecija. By June, Aguinaldo had moved his headquarters to Cabanatuan where, on June 2, a Declaration of War on the United States was officially proclaimed. On March 23, 1901, after about two years of war, Aguinaldo was captured in Palanan, Isabela. On April 1, 1901, Aguinaldo swore an oath accepting the authority of the United States over the Philippines and pledging his allegiance to the American government. U.S. civil government of the Philippines After Aguinaldo swore allegiance to the U.S., the U.S. military government was replaced by a civil government on July 4, 1901. Scattered fighting continued for some time but the U.S. enacted the Philippine Organic Act on July 1, 1902 and, on July 4, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed a full and complete pardon and amnesty to all people in the Philippine archipelago who had participated in the conflict, effectively ending the war. In 1916, the Philippine Autonomy Act, popularly known as the Jones Law, was passed by the U.S. Congress. The law, which served as the new organic act (or constitution) for the Philippines, stated in its preamble that the eventual independence of the Philippines would be American policy, subject to the establishment of a stable government. The law maintained the Governor General of the Philippines, appointed by the President of the United States, but established a bicameral Philippine Legislature to replace the elected Philippine Assembly (lower house) and appointive Philippine Commission (upper house) previously in place.Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916 (Jones Law) Numerous independence bills were submitted to the U.S. Congress, and the Hare‚ÄìHawes‚ÄìCutting Act became U.S. law on January 17, 1932. The law required ratification by the Philippine Senate, which was not forthcoming. Philippine President Quezon led a twelfth independence mission to Washington to secure a better independence act. The result was the Philippines Independence Act, more popularly known as the \\"Tydings‚ÄìMcDuffie Act\\", of 1934, which was ratified by the Philippine Senate. The law provided for the granting of Philippine independence by 1946. Ch.24 The Tydings- McDuffie Act specified a procedural framework for the drafting of a Constitution for the government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines within two years of its enactment and mandated U.S. recognition of independence of the Philippine Islands as a separate and self-governing nation after a ten- year transition period.. On May 5, 1934, the Philippines legislature passed an act setting the election of convention delegates. Governor General Frank Murphy designated July 10 as the election date, and the convention held its inaugural session on July 30. The completed draft constitution was approved by the convention on February 8, 1935, approved by U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt on March 23, and ratified by popular vote on May 14. The first election under the constitution was held on September 17, and on November 15, 1935 the Commonwealth government was inaugurated. Ch.24 Commonwealth period The period 1935‚Äì1946 would ideally be devoted to the final adjustments required for a peaceful transition to full independence, a great latitude in autonomy being granted in the meantime. On May 14, 1935, an election to fill the newly created office of President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines was won by Manuel L. Quezon (Nacionalista Party) and a Filipino government was formed on the basis of principles superficially similar to the US Constitution. (See: Philippine National Assembly). Japanese occupation during World War II A few hours after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Japanese launched air raids in several cities and US military installations in the Philippines on December 8, and on December 10, and Manila was occupied by the Japanese on January 2, 1942. The Commonwealth government by then had become a Government in exile seated in Washington, D.C., upon the invitation of U.S. President Roosevelt. Philippine President Manuel L. Quezon had declared Manila, the capital, an \\"open city\\" and left it under the rule of Jorge B. Vargas, as mayor. The Japanese entered the city on January 2, 1942 and established it as the capital. Japan fully captured the Philippines on May 6, 1942, after the Battle of Corregidor. The Second Philippine Republic was established on October 14, 1943 under Japanese occupation and endured until the end of the war, it was repudiated and the government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines restored. Independence and sovereignty In accordance with the Tydings‚ÄìMcDuffie Act, President Harry S. Truman issued Proclamation 2695 of July 4, 1946 officially recognizing the independence of the Philippines. On the same day, the Treaty of Manila between the governments of the United States and the Philippines was signed. The treaty provided for the recognition of the independence of the Republic of the Philippines and the relinquishment of American sovereignty over the Philippine Islands. During the interim since the end of the 19th century, the constitutive theory of statehood had given way to the declarative theory of statehood. A document that is often quoted on the matter is the Montevideo Convention (1933), Article 1 of which states: :The state as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications: (a) a permanent population; (b) a defined territory; (c) government; and (d) capacity to enter into relations with the other states. Once the Treaty of Manila took effect, the Philippines, in possession of all these qualifications, became an independent nation and a sovereign state. Post- independence territorial changes In 1961, the Philippines enacted Republic Act No. 3046 (RA3446), to define the baselines of the territorial sea of the Philippines. This Act was amended on September 18, 1968 by RA5446, and on March 10, 2009 by RA9522. Presidential Proclamation No. 1596 had asserted Philippine sovereignty over the Spratly Islands on June 11, 1978. RA9522 reasserted that, and also asserted Philippine sovereignty over Scarborough Shoal. On April 8, 2009, the Philippines lodged a partial territorial waters claim with the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (UNCLCS) in relation to the continental shelf in the region of Benham Rise. On April 28, 2012, Ramon Paje, director of the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources announced that the claim had been approved by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Independence Day holiday From 1946 to 1961, July 4 (the anniversary date of the Treaty of Manila), was observed as Independence Day. On May 12, 1962, Philippine President Diosdado Macapagal issued Presidential proclamation No. 28, which declared Tuesday, June 12, 1962 (the anniversary date of the 1898 Philippine Declaration of Independence) as a special public holiday throughout the Philippines, \\"... in commemoration of our people's declaration of their inherent and inalienable right to freedom and independence. \\" On August 4, 1964, Republic Act No. 4166 renamed the July 4 holiday as \\"Philippine Republic Day\\" (it was delisted as a public holiday in 1987), proclaimed the twelfth day of June as the Philippine Independence Day, and enjoined all citizens of the Philippines to observe June 12 with rites befitting Independence Day. Philippine Supreme Court statements regarding sovereignty During the period when the military government exercised administrative control, the Taft Commission (created on March 16, 1900) exercised legislative powers. On June 11, 1901, the commission had passed the Judiciary Law (Act no. 126), vesting judicial power in the Supreme Court, Courts of First Instance and Justice of the Peace courts. At least two cases decided by the Philippine Supreme Court contain statements by the court concerning the exchange of sovereignty between Spain and the United States. *In United States v. Smith, the Philippine Supreme Court wrote that a complete separation of Church and State had been caused by the change of sovereignty from Spain to the United States.United States v. Smith, G.R. No. L-14057, January 22, 1919, lawphil.net *In Philippines vs. Lo-Lo and Saraw, the court said, more clearly, \\"By the Treaty of Paris, Spain ceded the Philippine Islands to the United States.\\"Philippines vs. Lo-Lo and Saraw, G. R. No. L-17958, February 27, 1922, [Judiciary Law of the Second Philippin ChanRobles Law Library]. Disputes and challenges to sovereignty Island of Palmas The island of Palmas, also referred to as Miangas, is located in the Celebes Sea south of Mindanao, at approximately 5¬∞33‚Ä≤30‚Ä≥N, 127¬∞12‚Ä≤53¬∞ E. The island lies within the geographical area described by Article III of the Treaty of Paris as encompassing the Philippine archipelago and ceded by Spain to the U.S. The Island of Palmas Case was a case involving a territorial dispute between the Netherlands and the United States which was heard by the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The arbitrator ruled on April 4, 1928 that the island forms in its entirety a part of Netherlands territory. Spratly Islands The Spratly Islands, also known as the Kalayaan Islands, are a group of more than 650 reefs, islets, atolls, cays and islands in the South China Sea between the Philippines, China, Malaysia, Brunei, and Vietnam. They comprise less than five square kilometers of land area, spread over more than 400,000 square kilometers of sea. A number of sovereignty disputes regarding these islands have arisen, some of which remain unresolved . Sabah and Palawan Sabah is a Malaysian state located on the northern portion of the island of Borneo.Sabah, Malaysia, Google Maps. The Philippines has a dormant claim over much of the eastern part of the territory. To date, Malaysia continues to consistently reject Philippine calls to resolve the matter of Sabah's jurisdiction to the International Court of Justice.Philippines' Claim To Sabah, epilipinas.com. Also, territorial cessations made by the Sultan of Sulu have led to sovereignty disputes over the Philippine island of Palawan.

Edwards (SP-315), sometimes called USS W. A. Edwards, was a United States Navy patrol vessel in commission from 1917 to 1919. Construction, acquisition, and commissioning Wilbert A. Edwards was built as a wooden-hulled commercial steam fishing vessel of the same name in 1911 by M. M. Davis at Solomons Island, Maryland, for the W. A. Edwards Corporation. The U.S. Navy purchased her from the W. A. Edwards Corporation in 1917 for World War I service as a patrol vessel. She was commissioned as USS Wilbert A. Edwards (SP-315) on 10 August 1917Per the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships (at http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship- histories/danfs/w/wilbert-a-edwards.html), Navy General Order No. 314 of 28 July 1917 specified that \\"scout patrol\\" vessels having compound names -- such as Wilbert A. Edwards -- would be known by the surname only, which would have required USS Wilbert A. Edwards to become simply USS Edwards, but Wilbert A. Edwards appears to have retained her full name for the duration of her Navy service. Her logs, in fact, carry the name USS W. A. Edwards, while the Ships Data, U.S. Naval Vessels 1918 carries the full name USS Wilbert A. Edwards on the list of naval vessels. at the Norfolk Navy Yard in Portsmouth, Virginia, with Lieutenant D. C. Kindell, USNRF, in command. Career Attempted use on \\"distant service\\" Lieutenant Robert Phillips, NNV, relieved Lieutenant Kindell as commanding officer on 17 September 1917 while Wilbert A. Edwards was at Gravesend Bay, New York. Assigned to \\"distant service\\"‚Äîmeaning service outside the United States‚Äîshe departed Gravesend Bay on 19 September 1917, transited the Cape Cod Canal on the morning of 20 September 1917, and arrived at the Boston Navy Yard in Boston, Massachusetts, later that day. After voyage repairs, she left for Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, on 25 September 1917 on what was probably supposed to be the first leg of a voyage to Ponta Delgada in the Azores to take up patrol duties from that port. However, on 26 September 1917 she suffered an engine casualty and notified the nearby United States Coast Guard Cutter USCGC Algonquin of her plight. Algonquin took the disabled Wilbert A. Edwards in tow that afternoon and took her to Halifax, where they arrived on 27 September 1917. There, Wilbert A. Edwards coaled before getting underway in tow of Algonquin on 1 October 1917. The ships ran into a heavy storm on the afternoon of the first day out of port. Weather conditions had worsened rapidly, and Wilbert A. Edwards rolled and labored heavily, shipping much water. By 0500 hours on 2 October 1917, the chief engineer on board reported to Lieutenant Phillips that the ship was taking water and that he was unable to keep the flooding under control. At 0800 hours, the executive officer, Lieutenant, junior grade, Henry J. Porter, USNRF, and the ship's carpenter examined the steering gear and found the quadrant working loose on the rudder, the stuffing box slack in its bed, and all bolts loose in the woodwork. They tried to repair the damage but could not. Meanwhile, the flooding continued below decks as the ship rolled and pitched at an alarming rate. By noon, though, the water in the engine room had not gained on the pumps. At last the ship seemed to be holding her own. Algonquin kept Wilbert A. Edwards in tow as she steamed ahead at slow speed, and the two ships eventually returned to Halifax on 4 October 1917. Reassignment to the 1st Naval District After ultimately returning to Boston in company with the collier USS Mars (Collier No. 6), Wilbert A. Edwards underwent repairs there. However, the Navy concluded that she would not be fit for \\"distant service\\" and, on 2 February 1918, reassigned her to section patrol duties in the 1st Naval District in northern New England. Wilbert A. Edwards remained in 1st Naval District service through the end of World War I and into 1919, spending most of her time under repair. Decommissioning and disposal Wilbert A. Edwards was decommissioned at Boston on 21 August 1919. She was stricken from the Navy List on 24 September 1919 and simultaneously sold back to the W. A. Edwards Corporation. She resumed commercial operations, which she continued into the late 1940s. Notes References * *NavSource Online: Section Patrol Craft Photo Archive Wilbert A.

The film stars M√©lanie Laurent, Jean Reno, Sylvie Testud and Gad Elmaleh. Based on the true story of a young Jewish boy, the film depicts the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup (Rafle du Vel' d'Hiv), the mass arrest of Jews by French police who were accomplices of Nazi Germans in Paris in July 1942. Plot Jo Weisman, a young Jewish Parisian, and his family are taken by the Germans and Vichy collaborators in the rafle du Vel' d'Hiv. Anna Traube, a 20-year-old woman, walks out of the velodrome with forged papers; her mother and sister are captured. Annette Monod, a Protestant nurse, volunteers for the velodrome, and assists Jewish doctor David Sheinbaum. From the V√©lodrome d'Hiver Jo's family and Sheinbaum are transferred to the Beaune-la-Rolande internment camp. Monod comes along. She does what she can to help the children, who are soon falling sick from the camp diet and conditions. The parents are dispatched by train to supposed \\"work camps in the East\\" (in reality the extermination camps), and Sheinbaum too. Monod wants to come along, but Sheinbaum talks her out of it. After some time authorities announce that for humanitarian reasons the children will be reunited with their parents in the east (in reality the adults have already been killed, and they are now going to kill the children). Some children believe they will rejoin their parents. However, Jo and another boy, Pavel, escape under barbed wire, taking money that the family had hidden in the toilets along with their valuables. While the other children are being taken away, a doctor treats Monod, who is now sick herself. The doctor informs Monod that the Resistance has now learned the true fate of the deported Jews. When Monod hears what happens to them, she races after the children despite her sick condition. But she finds the train had just left. After the war, Monod searches for survivors at the H√¥tel Lutetia. She finds Jo, who has survived and is to be adopted by a family, and a younger boy No√©, to whom she had also been close. He had somehow slipped out of the group of children taken away on the train to the extermination camps. Reality The plot features several real people, including Jo Weisman and Anna Traube; in the film her mother and sister are captured, in real life they also escaped to join their father in Limoges. Another real character is Annette Monod. Dr. David Sheinbaum, played by Jean Reno, is a synthesis of more than one doctor.

Production on the set of The Round Up Roselyne Bosch first decided to make a film of the events surrounding the rafle du Vel' d'Hiv because she felt sympathy with the victims. Her husband's family is Jewish and lived in Montmartre near where the Weismann family lived. Her father had been detained in one of Francisco Franco's internment camps, so she felt a connection with the subject matter. She began extensively researching the events surrounding the round up and discovered survivor Joseph Weismann and Annette Monod whose memories would eventually form the base of the script. Bosch decided to portray only real life characters in the film and cast Gad Elmaleh in the role of Joseph's father, Schmuel Weismann. Initially, Elmaleh was hesitant to accept a serious dramatic role, but after reading the script he agreed to play the role. Actress M√©lanie Laurent was cast in the role of the Red Cross worker Annette Monod, whose actions were noble and undisputed, before, during, and after the round up. Bosch's husband Alain Goldman produced the film. Shooting began in May 2009 and lasted for 13 weeks. 9,000 extras were used and facsimiles of the V√©lodrome d'hiver and a concentration camp were reconstructed in Hungary for the film. Release The French premiere took place on 10 March 2010. The film also opened in Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland on the same day. Box office The Round Up opened in first place in its opening weekend, ranking ahead of Shutter Island at the French box office. In France, it did three million admissions, topping other films on the Holocaust, such as \\"The Pianist\\" and \\"Schindler's List\\". It then gathered another 7 million viewers on free TV for its first run, becoming the number one French film of the year and appearing in the TF1 polls as the \\"favorite\\" film of the audience that year. The DVD remained three weeks in a row at the top of the box office in 2011. Home media The DVD of The Round Up was released in France on 7 September 2010. It was released on the American iTunes Store on May 14, 2013. Critical reception The film received positive reviews from critics. *Weekly magazine Nouvel Observateur (Fran√ßois Forestier, ¬´ La Rafle ¬ª [archive], Nouvelobs.com, 2011) says The Round Up is \\"a courageous film (...), with an extraordinary emotional quality: it is impossible to remain insensitive watching this shameful story. This film honors the French cinema\\". *Figaroscope (Le Figaro, Top 10 du cin√©ma, 19 March 2010): 'The director films through the children's eyes ( ... ). Her delicate and meticulous fresco is moving without excess\\". *Journal du Dimanche (Carlos Gomez): \\"The emotion goes crescendo, without ostentation and steadily, with dignity\\". *Paris Match (Alain Spira): \\"The stars in the film are the children, in all their overwhelming authenticity. To film this tragedy, Rose Bosch is both at a reasonable distance, but gives to her film incredible intensity\\". *Ouest France: \\"Impressive, spectacular and gripping.\\" Jean Reno, Sylvie Testud and Melanie Laurent give performances with a sincerity dictated by the subject itself\\". *L'Express (Emmanuelle Cirodde): \\"Both 'Schindler's List' and 'The Pianist' were describing lonesome characters. Rose Bosch chooses to describe ordinary people, particularly children\\". Other media are less enthusiastic, such as: *Telerama, addressing the question: \\"Can horror be described?\\" *On the first French Cinema website, \\"Allo Cin√©\\" analyzes critics this way: 36% give \\"5 stars out of 5\\", 28% allow 4/5 and 7% give no star at all. *In the U.S, Variety ([archive], variety.com, 11 March 2010), says \\"With impeccable production values and all-around stirring performances, pic emphasizes the unbearable emotions caused by \\"events, even the most extreme, that actually happened, though it often oversimplifies them into a framework of good vs. evil\\". Following wide local release March 10, this ‚Ç¨20 million ($27 million) co-production should round up ample worldwide biz.\\" *In England, The Guardian (Peter Bradshaw, 2010) says the film is \\"A straightforward, heartfelt drama about the occupation of France by Nazi Germany\\". Controversy In an interview for the French magazine Les ann√©es laser in September 2010, Roselyne Bosch compared people who do not cry at the film to \\"spoiled children\\", or cynics who \\"consider human emotions as an abomination or a weakness\\", just \\"like Hitler did\\". Her remarks were strongly criticized by several French media,¬´la rafle¬ª a des vapeurs, Lib√©ration, 30 September 2010.R√©fractaires √† ¬´la rafle¬ª, compar√©s √† Hitler, Arr√™t sur images, 30 September 2010. and by the cinema website Selenie who accused her of \\"saying one of the silliest thing[s] of the last few years\\". Roselyne Bosch sued the website for publicly insulting her, but her case was dismissed in April 2013, the Paris Court judging that the critic did not exceed the boundaries of freedom of expression.La r√©alisatrice de La Rafle √©choue √† faire taire une critique sur Overblog, Pcinpact.Arr√™t du 4 avril 2013 de la cour d'appel de Paris .

Eisner.http://theartofmemory.blogspot.com/2007/06/fritz-arno-wagner- cinematographer-13.html Background Born in Schmiedefeld am Rennsteig, Germany, Wagner received his training at the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts in Paris. In 1910, while still attending the University of Leipzig, he managed to secure a job as a clerk at the Path√© film company. In 1912, he became both secretary and chef at the Path√© offices in Vienna and later in Berlin.http://www.cinematographers.nl/GreatDoPh/wagner.htm Career as cinematographer An iconic scene of the shadow of the vampire climbing up a staircase from F.W. Murnau's \\"Nosferatu\\" (1922)Interested in cinematography he became a newsreel cameraman in 1913 and was stationed in New York for Path√© Weekly where he reported on the Mexican Revolution. At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, he returned to Germany to enlist in his country's elite Hussar cavalry whilst still filming war reports.http://www.oldmagazinearticles.com/pdf/WW1%20de%20cav.pdf However, after being wounded, he decided to take the job of stills photographer and then 2nd cameraman at Projektions-AG Union PAGU. In 1919, he went to work as a primary cameraman for Decla-Bioscop. Peter Lorre gazing into a shop window in Fritz Lang's \\"M\\" (1931). Lang and Wagner used glass and reflections throughout the film for expressive purposes. Along with Karl Freund, Wagner became Germany's leading cinematographer of the 1920s and 1930s, a master of the dark, moody lighting that characterized the expressionist movement.http://mubi.com/cast_members/1325 He worked with some of Germany most prominent directors, including Ernst Lubitsch on Madame Du Barry (1919), F.W. Murnau on The Haunted Castle (1921), The Burning Soil (1922) and his classic Nosferatu (1922), and G.W. Pabst on four features, The Love of Jeanne Ney (1927), Westfront 1918 (1930), Comradeship (1931) and The Threepenny Opera (1931) based on the Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill musical. He also collaborated with Fritz Lang on four films, Destiny (1921), Spies (1928), M (1931) and The Testament of Dr. Mabuse (1932). After the Nazis took over in 1933, causing many of the country's leading film directors to flee Germany for the U.S. (including his main collaborators: Murnau, Pabst and Lang) Wagner's career began to decline. To make ends meet he abandoned his unique style and turned to making glossy costume epics and musicals for The Ministry of Propaganda at Universum Film AG [Ufa] where he had once worked under Erich Pommer.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/18548962 After WWII, he worked for a couple of years as a director of photography of documentaries and newsreels before returning to feature films for the DEFA production company at Studio Babelsberg.http://www.filmreference.com/Writers-and-Production-Artists-Vi- Win/Wagner-Fritz-Arno.html Death On 18 August 1958, Wagner died in G√∂ttingen in an automobile accident (as his colleague Murnau had 27 years earlier) whilst shooting the comedy Ohne Mutter geht es nicht (It Doesn't Work Without a Mother) for director Erik Ode.

Located at the foot of the Champs-√âlys√©es, the Crillon along with the H√¥tel de la Marine is one of two identical stone palaces on the Place de la Concorde. It has been listed since 1900 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. H√¥tel Crillon With 78 guest rooms and 46 suites,H√¥tel de Crillon's rooms the hotel also features three restaurants, a bar, outdoor terrace, gym and health club on the premises. The hotel was renovated from 2013 to 2017. In September 2018, the Crillon was officially designated by Atout France as a Palace grade of hotel.  History  H√¥tel de Crillon on the left, with the H√¥tel de la Marine on the right The building that is now the hotel was constructed in 1758, after King Louis XV commissioned the architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel to build two neoclassical palaces in what would become the Place de la Concorde. The two identical buildings, separated by the rue Royale, were initially designed to be offices of the French state. The eastern building, H√¥tel de la Marine, housed the headquarters of the French Navy until 2015. The western building that would become the H√¥tel de Crillon was first occupied by Louis Marie Augustin, Duke of Aurmont, a famous patron of the arts. The building was further enhanced by its second owner, the architect Louis-Fran√ßois Trouard, who had the Salon de Aigles built in 1775. On 6 February 1778, the building was the venue where the newly founded United States and France signed their first treaties. Americans Benjamin Franklin, Silas Deane and Arthur Lee met French diplomat Conrad Alexandre G√©rard de Rayneval to conclude the French- American treaty that recognised the Declaration of Independence of the United States and a trade agreement. In 1788, Fran√ßois F√©lix de Crillon (son of Louis de Crillon, Duke of Crillon) acquired the building for his home. However, the government of the French Revolution confiscated the property in 1791. During this period, the home was used by King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette. Two years later in 1793, King Louis XVI as well as Queen Marie Antoinette were guillotined in the Place de la Concorde directly in front of the building. Eventually, the building was returned to the Crillon family, whose descendants lived there for more than a century until 1904. In 1907, the Soci√©t√© du Louvre purchased the property and transformed it into a hotel. The building then underwent a two-year refurbishment under the supervision of architect Walter- Andr√© Destailleur. This included the purchase of two neighbouring buildings on the rue Boissy d'Anglas to enlarge the property. The new H√¥tel de Crillon opened on 12 March 1909. The hotel housed members of the American delegation to the Paris Peace Conference after World War I, including President Wilson's key advisor, Edward House.MacMillan, Margaret. Peacemakers: The Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and Its Attempt to End War. London: John Murray Publishers, 2001, pp. 32‚Äì33 . From 1992 to 2012, the hotel was the venue of the Bal des d√©butantes, an annual fashion event which was cited by Forbes in 2005 as one of the world's ten best parties. The hotel has been visited by many notable figures over the years, including Theodore Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, Madonna and Taylor Swift. In March 2013, H√¥tel de Crillon closed for a series of renovations led by Aline Asmar d'Amman. This project was designed to renovate and modernize the space. The renovation combined the hotel's protected landmark features, such as the 19th-century grand staircase and saloons, with modern styles and amenities. Tristan Auer, Chahan Minassian, Cyril Vergniol and Karl Lagerfeld worked alongside d'Amman on this ‚Ç¨200 million project. Karl Lagerfeld designed Les Grands Apartements, the most extravagant suites on the property. The 2013 renovations lasted until July 2017.  Ownership  H√¥tel de Crillon in 2019 Until 2005, through Concorde Hotels & Resorts, the H√¥tel de Crillon was part of the Soci√©t√© du Louvre (whose shares were listed on the Paris Stock Exchange) and was controlled by the Taittinger family holding company. The Starwood Capital Group bought the hotel from the former Taittinger group in 2005. On 1 November 2010, Le Figaro reported that a sale was in final negotiations to a Saudi group related to the Saudi Arabian royal family. On 23 November 2010, Starwood announced the sale of the hotel to a Saudi Arabian royal family member, Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. In December 2013, Rosewood Hotels & Resorts announced that it would manage the property, which reopened on 5 July 2017.

When that bill proved ineffective, the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt revised it into the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1937. This has set the stage for further government intervention in the food, drug and agricultural markets. The Pure Foods Movement The Pure Foods Movement of the 1870s was a grass-roots movement creating the \\"principal source of political support for the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906\\". It was a coalition of many different groups, which is why it became so influential.Young 19 The following explains the influential groups and individuals involved, as it was not an official coalition, rather a movement created by different individual interests. Impact of women's clubs The Ladies Health Protective Association was the first women's group to join the pure foods movement.Goodwin 17 Starting in 1884, they began a campaign to rid New York City of unsanitary slaughter houses. These women were \\"energized to take legal action almost as much by the attitude of the city bureaucrats [who were apathetic] was by the need to protect their families and the neighborhood\\".Goodwin 18 If the city agency in charge of regulating slaughterhouses had been willing to listen to the Association and clean up the slaughterhouses, the women would have never continued their crusade. However, after a hearing, a slaughterhouse owner refused to clean up his property and this caused the women to pursue the execution of the penalty and continue a \\"constant vigilance\\" to keep it from happening again.Goodwin 19 Inspired by the Association, 11 other city health protective associations grew out of the need to clean up stockyards and slaughterhouses. In Louisiana, Mrs. Richard Bloor took individual action and visited a packinghouse and afterwards \\"sent a description of the conditions to Upton Sinclair to use in his expos√©s of the meat industry\\".Goodwin 22 The Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) was borne out of a need to protect communities from alcohol abuse and worked mostly on the local level.Goodwin 30 Working mostly only on a local level, they set the tone for the Pure Food movement that would soon follow. Many club women were heavily involved in the temperance movement and began to associate adulterated foods as having the same consequences as alcohol abuse. This is because both inflicted harm on communities. Both were common abuses prevalent in poor communities, and led to malnourishment, violence and other social problems. Women‚Äôs organizations began addressing these issues and broadened their activities beyond normal WCTU activities and more women who wanted to protect their communities joined their cause.Goodwin 35 Members of the WCTU, the Ladies Health Protective Association, and women's clubs laid the foundation for further \\"pure food, drink, and drug campaigns in the early 1880s, while their activities centered around study, self-improvement, and philanthropy\\". Harvey W. Wiley Harvey W. Wiley became the leader of the pure foods crusade. When Wiley was appointed, he decidedly set the Division of Chemistry in a different direction. He expanded the Division's research and conducted the Foods and Food Adulterants study, which demonstrated his concern about chemicals used in food. He also created the \\"Poison Squad\\" experiments, in which young, healthy men volunteered to ingest food additive chemicals to determine their impact on human health. Wiley unified many different concerned groups, including state inspectors, the General Federation of Women's Clubs, journalists, reform wing of business, congress members and associations of physicians and pharmacists. As Wiley worked to bring awareness to the pure foods crusades, it gained momentum and legitimacy. His \\"poison squad\\" brought national awareness to the problem, whereas women's groups brought local attention to the cause. Upton Sinclair and The Jungle In 1906, Upton Sinclair published The Jungle, a book which exposed the filthy conditions of Chicago slaughterhouses. Sinclair wrote the book while living in Chicago; he talked to workers and their families and his focus was the plight of the workers. However, the book turned people away from \\"tubercular beef\\" instead of turning them socialist like Sinclair wanted.Goodwin 250 The book was a best seller and the public outcry prompted President Theodore Roosevelt to send officials to investigate. Their ‚Äúreport was so shocking that its publication would ‚Äòbe well-nigh ruinous to our export trade in meat‚Äô‚Äù.Garraty 591 This report, Neill-Reynolds, underscored the terrible conditions illustrated by Sinclair.Goodwin 251 It indicated a need for \\"'a drastic and thorogooing [sic]' federal inspection of all stockyards, packinghouses and their products\\". The Jungle, combined with the shocking reports of the Neill-Reynolds Report (published June 1906) proved to be the final push to help the Pure Food and Drug Act move quickly through congress. The 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act (Wiley Act) Origins Before the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act, most food oversight was mandated to state laws, which were enacted during the colonial days and served mainly trade interests.Janssen 24 They set standards of weight, and \\"provided for inspections of exports like salt meats, fish and flour\\". In 1848, the first national law concerned with regulating food come out of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and \\"banned the importation of adulterated drugs\\".Young 17 Food inspection was largely thought to be the duty of the consumer, not the government.Young 21 =Changes in technology= With the advent of modern machinery, food production (especially grain) moved forward at an alarming pace.Garraty 478 For example, the ‚Äúcanning line‚Äù increased the efficiency of canning foods in an industrial setting. An 1886 report by the Illinois Bureau of Labor Statistics claimed that ‚ÄúNew machinery has displaced fully 50 percent of the muscular labor formerly required to do a given amount of work‚Äù. Because of these improvements to agriculture, packaged cereals and canned foods became popular. Synthetic medicines (made in labs instead of natural medicines) and chemicals that altered the growing and processing of food began to appear. =Processed food= Processed food was more easily transported, thanks to improvements in transportation.Young 18 Chemical additives were used to \\"heighten color, modify flavor, soften texture, deter spoilage, and even transform ... apple scraps, glucose, coal-tar dye, and timothy seed\\" into a \\"strawberry jam\\". However, for these new products, there was no regulation and manufacturers were able to put whatever ingredients they wanted in products like ‚Äútonics‚Äù without having to list them.Garraty 590 Products were often labeled and packaged to appear larger than they were, or packaged to appear to have a higher concentration of food.Junod 176 This began to worry high-quality producers who worried that their products might be undermined by deceitful goods.Swann 10 Farmers felt threatened by unfair competition as shady producers adulterated \\"fertilizers, deodorized rotten eggs, revived rancid butter, and substituted glucose for honey\\". Real strawberry jam producers felt threatened by the bad strawberry ‚Äúspread‚Äù substitutes, since consumers could not tell the difference while buying. Court response The first court case involving \\"adulterated\\" products was in 1886, in which farmers pitted quote ‚Äúthe reigning champion, butter, against a challenger, oleomargarine. Butter won and oleomargarine was taxed\\". \\"Adulterated\\" products often used chemicals or additives to mask poor quality wheat, sour milk, or meat gone bad. In response, these \\"unethical\\" companies asserted that it was a consumer‚Äôs duty to protect themselves from shoddy products. The Division of Chemistry started looking into the adulteration of agricultural commodities around 1867, and in 1883 Harvey Washington Wiley was appointed chief chemist. Provisions of the act The law \\"forbade interstate and foreign commerce in adulterated and misbranded food and drugs\\". If a product was found to be in violation, it could be seized and condemned; if a seller was found violating they could be fined and jailed. The law did not define food standards by chemists, but it did prohibit the \\"adulteration of food by the removal of valuable constituents, the substitution of ingredients so as to reduce quality, the addition of deleterious ingredients and the use of spoiled animal and vegetable products\\". Misleading or false labeling was now considered misbranding and thus illegal. Effects of the act The 1906 US Pure Food and Drug Act ‚Äúdefined food adulterations as a danger to health and as consumer fraud‚Äù.Junod 167 The ‚ÄúMeat Inspection Act,‚Äù which accompanied the law, made tax payers pay for the new regulation.Schesinger 205 The Department of Chemistry was transformed into a regulatory body charged with regulating packaging, labeling and protecting the consumer. The jam industry was one of the first to be subject to regulation. If a jam did not fit a certain standard of fruit-to-sugar-to-pectin ratio, it bore a ‚ÄúCompound Jam‚Äù label. After World War One, these companies, like BRED-SPRED, started aggressive marketing campaigns and attractive packaging to promote themselves. Branded with ‚Äòdistinctive names‚Äô like ‚ÄúPeanut Spread‚Äù and ‚ÄúSalad Bouquet,‚Äù they sold a weak product (like a low ratio of peanuts, or weak vinegar) as high-quality substitutes. Similar deceptive labeling in canned foods prompted the McNary- Mapes Amendment in 1930 which ‚Äúauthorized standards of quality, condition, and/or fill-of-containers.‚Äù If a product was sub-standard, it had to display a ‚Äòcrepe label‚Äô which read ‚Äòbelow US standard, low quality, but not illegal‚Äô.Schesinger 172 The American Chamber of Horrors Aided by Eleanor Roosevelt, the \\"American Chamber of Horrors\\" helped illuminate the deficiencies in the old 1906 Act. Launched in 1933 with the book 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs by Arthur Kallet and Frederick J. Schlink, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) put on an exhibit to illustrate the need for a new law. Eleanor Roosevelt toured it to help elevate its status as a public relations tool. It showed jars with deceptive labeling and packaging which, in the case of jarred chicken, hid dark meat and was jarred in deceptive containers which seemed larger than they were. Included were examples of harmful drugs, including Banbar, a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for diabetes, protected under the 1906 law, and Lash Lure, an eyelash dye that caused many of its women users to go blind.Swann 12 Also legal under the old law was Radithor, a ‚Äúradium-containing tonic that sentenced users to a slow and painful death.‚Äù This, along with the above court cases, caused the FDA to focus on replacing the now outdated ‚ÄúWiley Act‚Äù of 1906. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act was signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on June 25, 1938.Janssen 28 The first attempt at reform, The ‚ÄúTugwell Bill‚Äù was a ‚Äúlegislative disaster‚Äù. Spurred by public outcry from the Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster (in which 100 people were killed because under the 1906 law, ‚Äúpremarketing toxicity testing was not required‚Äù), congress rushed to enact a new bill.Wax 1, Janssen 28 Even with the Elixar disaster, the bill itself was not subject to much public awareness.Cavers 2 Provisions of the act This resulted in the 1938 Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act which ‚Äúpioneered policies designed to protect the pocketbooks of consumers and food standards were enacted to ensure the ‚Äòvalue expected‚Äô of consumers‚Äù.Junod 180 ‚ÄúIt changed the drug focus of the Food and Drug Administration from that of a policing agency primarily concerned with the confiscation of adulterated drugs to a regulatory agency increasingly involved with overseeing the evaluation of new drugs‚Äù.Wax 1 Changes from the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act The following is a list of substantial changes from the previous 1906 lawJanssen 29 * Drug manufacturers were required to provide scientific proof that new products could be safely used before putting them on the market. * Cosmetics and therapeutic devices were regulated, for the first time. * Proof of fraud was no longer required to stop false claims for drugs. * Addition of poisonous substances to foods was prohibited except where unavoidable or required in production. Safe tolerances were authorized for residues of such substances, for example pesticides. * Specific authority was provided for factory inspections. * Food standards were required to be set up when needed ‚Äúto promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers.‚Äù * Federal court injunctions against violations were added to the previous legal remedies of product seizures and criminal prosecutions.

She wrote a book, \\"Spring in a small island\\" in 1938, about her experiences in persuading leprosy patients in remote areas of Japan into hospitalization. It created a sensation in Japan, and was made into a film. She was criticized for accelerating the \\"No leprosy patients in prefecture\\" movement and giving an impression that leprosy is to be feared. Career She was born in Yamanashi Prefecture on March 26, 1902. After her marriage in 1920 and divorce in 1923, she entered the Tokyo Women's Medical College in 1924. At graduation, she visited Kensuke Mitsuda, at the Zenshoen Hospital but her application for employment was rejected and she worked at other hospitals. On June 12, 1934 she went to the Nagashima Aiseien, Okayama Prefecture, where Mitsuda was the director. She was initially hired as informal doctor, then as formal doctor in 1934. Mitsuda ordered her to go on trips to remote areas of the prefecture in order to examine people for leprosy in remote areas and hospitalize those who were affected. She developed tuberculosis in 1937. At the order of Mitsuda, she wrote a book \\"Spring in a small island\\", which was published in 1938. It created a sensation within Japan. On April 29, 1943, she died of pulmonary tuberculosis. In 1991, the Masako Ogawa Memorial House was built in her home in Yamanashi Prefecture. \\"Spring in a small island\\" In this book, she wrote her experiences in her trips of examination of leprosy patients in remote mountainous areas and islands. In the first story, her team was composed of a clerk, a male nurse and Masako Ogawa. They brought a projector to show village people that leprosy patients should be treated in sanatoriums. Ogawa described her experiences in visiting patients living in poor houses, finding new patients in the same house of patients. In addition to her book, she wrote tanka, a Japanese short poem.Spring in a small island. A memorandom of a woman doctor Masako Ogawa, Nagasaki Jirou Shoten (in Japanese) 1938 Reaction Mokutaro Kinoshita, a literary critic and physician, wrote that this book gave strong favorable impressions because of the description, the \\"sincerity\\" of the author and her literary ability. However, after seeing the movie, he commented that the best method of leprosy control would be by chemotherapy, and not by segregation. Eiko Arai coined a word \\"Spring in a small island\\" phenomenon, explaining the wave of support concerning Masako Ogawa.Hansen's disease and Christianity. Eiko Arai, Iwanami shoten. 1996 (In Japanese) The trend may represent the sentiments of Japanese against the trend of militarization at that time, although some may see Ogawa as a patriot. Eiko Arai also considered Ogawa to be \\"a new woman\\", an independent woman in the Taisho Era. Arai further discussed the Ogawa's faith in Christianity. Criticisms Masako Ogawa was criticized for accelerating the No Leprosy Patients in Our Prefecture Movement, depicting leprosy as a disease to be feared. She reported that pregnancy worsened leprosy, and tried to justify the segregation, which her teacher, Mitsuda, firmly believed. References *Ogawa Masako to Aiseien Nawa Chika 1988, Yano Insatsu.

He was the son of Helen Elizabeth Whiteside and Robert Soutter, a noted Boston orthopaedic surgeon. He graduated from Harvard college in 1931, with an AB in History, and from Harvard Medical School in 1935. He served residencies in Obstetrics and Gynecology and Thoracics. He was awarded the Silver Star for actions at the Battle of Bastogne in World War II, and went on to found the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, Massachusetts. The Atlantis, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution In July 1931 Soutter signed on to be a crew member on the maiden sail of the Atlantis, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's first research vessel. Doctor Henry Bryant Bigelow, the first director of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and professor of zoology at Harvard (and later, Soutter's father-in-law) received funding from the Rockefeller Foundation to build this vessel and to embark upon oceanographic and hydrographic investigations. The Rat and McKenzie Rivers, Yukon Territory In the summer of 1933 Soutter and a friend, Graham Webster, paddled a canoe 1500-miles through uncharted Yukon wilderness. They experienced several setbacks, including a serious injury for Webster. They arrived safely at Ft. Yukon and traveled home through Fairbanks, Alaska. Captain Robert A. Bartlett and the Effie M. Morrissey, Summer 1935 The summer after he graduated from Harvard Medical School, Soutter joined a voyage with the famous Captain Robert A. Bartlett (1875‚Äì1946), who had been part of Admiral Robert Peary's group that discovered the North Pole in 1909. Bartlett had bought an old schooner, the Effie M. Morrissey, in 1926 and had been conducting oceanographic expeditions in the Arctic for various scientific organizations. This particular expedition to northwest Greenland in 1935 was sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution, the Field Museum, and the National Museum. Soutter was ship's doctor and chief science officer. Captain Bartlett conducted the hydrographic and mineral studies and Dr Soutter gathered plankton and fish samples. Soutter himself conducted almost 100 plankton experiments, many at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning in the full daylight of the midnight sun. These experiments provided a foundation of knowledge of the sea and its inhabitants in cold climates. The expedition was also commissioned to bring back a live baby walrus for the Bronx Zoo and to make plaster casts of a narwhal, a small Arctic whale, for a future Smithsonian exhibit. Residency in New York, and the Hindenburg Disaster On May 6, 1937 the Hindenburg, one of the largest zeppelins ever built, exploded in midair over Lakehurst Naval Air Station in New Jersey where it was attempting to land. One of the 62 survivors was the Captain of the ship, Max Pruss. He was barely alive and had sustained severe burns that required several operations. Dr Soutter, fluent in German, assisted in many surgical procedures on Hindenburg victims, including Captain Pruss. When Captain Pruss was well enough to travel back to his home in Frankfurt, Germany, Dr Soutter accompanied him. While in Germany, he toured the zeppelin factories in Friedrichshafen near Lake Constance in the southern part of the country. MGH Blood Bank and the Cocoanut Grove Fire After Dr Soutter left his residencies in New York City, he settled back in Boston, his hometown. In 1940 Dr Soutter went to work at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) to assist on the surgical staff. With the outbreak of World War II, Dr Soutter believed that a blood bank was critical for civil defense. He solicited funds to pay for the equipment, and he and his staff created new techniques for blood filtration and purification. Patients were blood typed in advance of their operative procedures. Dr Soutter helped to create an elaborate system for managing blood and began work advertising for volunteer donors. When the Cocoanut Grove fire occurred in Boston in November 1942, large amounts of stored plasma from the MGH blood bank played a major role in the treatment of the 500 injured. World War II, Bastogne and the Silver Star In 1943 Dr Soutter was assigned to the Army's Fourth Auxiliary Surgical Unit and commanded a team attached to the First and Third Armies who were fighting in Europe. On December 26, 1944, Dr Soutter was the first volunteer when General McAuliffe called for medical assistance for the wounded troops who were surrounded at Bastogne in Belgium near the French border. Twelve medical personnel filed into an engineless glider that had been loaded with medical supplies. The glider's towline was picked up by a C47 cargo plane and the aircraft became airborne. Then, the tether line was disengaged and the glider sailed low and silent over the forests of Ardennes. They landed in the middle of a field. The occupants had to wait for a lull in the fighting to leave the glider and then had to run for the medical tent. Dr Soutter and the other medical personnel performed 63 operations in the next 24 hours. Within the next couple of days, the First and Third Army Divisions broke through the enemy perimeter and began to make their way to liberate Bastogne. In mid- January 1945 Dr Soutter and each member of his medical team received the Silver Star (see left below), the second highest military medal awarded, for \\"conspicuous gallantry in action.\\" In 2002 the World War II Veterans of the Battle of the Bulge Association named their Worcester chapter after Soutter. After Bastogne, Dr Soutter was attached to the 42nd Field Hospital, where he worked with Corporal James K. Sunshine, Surgical Technician 3rd Platoon. Mr.l Sunshine recounted his World War II experiences and the beginning of a lifelong friendship with Major Soutter in an article originally published under the title \\"War Stories\\" in the Providence Sun Journal in 1994.http://users.skynet.be/jeeper/page124.html An account of Dr.Soutter and his team's work in Bastogne was published in the Army's That Men Might Live‚ÄîThe Story of the Army Medical Corps http://www.lonesentry.com/gi_stories_booklets/medical/index.html Boston University In 1952 Dr Soutter became an associate professor in the surgery department of the Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM). There he developed innovative ideas about medical education and how it is structured. He saw a need for medical education to broaden itself to include much more than just chemistry and science. He realized that the delivery of health care had to change and the education of physicians must follow suit. The number of generalist physicians was declining, and Dr Soutter sought to address this problem by training more generalists who would work along with the specialists. At BUSM his career as a medical educator progressed from his appointment as Associate Dean in 1955, to Acting Dean in 1959, and then to Dean in 1960. Medical Libraries Dr Soutter took an active interest in libraries and the role they have played in the education of physicians throughout the ages. As a trustee of the Boston Medical Library in the 1960s, he was instrumental in orchestrating a merger of the Harvard Medical School's library collection with that of the Boston Medical Library in 1965. A large medical library, the Francis A. Countway Library, was being built expressly for the purpose of the merger. Harvard's library collection was established in 1782, the date of the founding of the medical school there, and the Boston Medical Library's collection was established in 1875. When Dr Soutter came to Worcester in the late 1960s, he was the catalyst for the merger of the library collection of the Worcester District Medical Society with that of the newly founded University of Massachusetts Medical School. The plans for the new school's library included a Rare Book Room specifically intended to house the collection of the Worcester Medical Library, which was established in 1798. The merger finally became a reality when the Medical School Library opened its doors in 1973. Mr Charles C. Colby III, Librarian at the Boston Medical Library, was the library consultant on the project. The Medical School Library was renamed The Lamar Soutter Library in 1981 in Dr Soutter's honor. UMass Medical School In October 1962 legislation was enacted establishing the University of Massachusetts Medical School and in December 1963 Massachusetts Governor Endicott Peabody named Dr Soutter Dean of the Medical School project. In February 1964 Dr Soutter began to select faculty, and on October 23, 1969 ground was broken at the campus in Worcester. The first class was graduated in 1974. Family and death Dr Soutter was married to Norah Goldsmith in New York City in 1939, and they had a son, Nicholas. They divorced, and in 1946 Dr Soutter married Mary Cleveland Bigelow. Together they raised their son and two daughters. Dr Soutter died in Concord, Massachusetts in 1996.

Dubbed a stone frigate, HMCS Star is a land-based naval establishment for training part-time sailors as well as functioning as a local recruitment centre for the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). The second oldest of 24 naval reserve divisions located in major cities across Canada, Star was stood up on 15 March 1923 as the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve (RCNVR) Hamilton Half Company and then on 1 November 1941 as HMCS Star.  Namesake  Named after HMS Lord Melville/Star, the Royal Navy 14-gun brig launched at Kingston, Ontario on 20 July 1813, the name Star honours the Royal Navy's presence on Lake Ontario and the defense of Canada during the War of 1812.  History   Early history (1800s)  Naval activity in Hamilton Harbour can be traced as far back as the late 18th and early 19th century when HMS Lord Melville, later HMS Star, of the British Provincial Marine and Royal Navy plied Lake Ontario conducting coastal protection operations. During the Lower and Upper Canada Rebellions of 1837, a naval militia from Hamilton ignited a diplomatic crisis, known as the Caroline Affair, when a group of Hamiltonians captured the Canadian rebel supply vessel, SS Caroline, killing an American crew member and then setting fire to the ship before sending it over Niagara Falls. The Militia Act of 1855 authorized the formation of Volunteer Marine Companies. Out of fear of invasion from the United States, seven years later on 31 January 1862, the Hamilton Volunteer Naval Company was stood up under the command of Captain Thomas Harbottle and Lieutenant George P. Malcomson. As the American Civil War ended, in 1866 the Hamilton Naval Brigade was called out on short periods of active duty guarding the city and manning steamboats in response to Fenian cross-border raids. For their service during the Fenian Raids, Hamilton's naval volunteers were awarded the Canada General Service Medal with the Fenian Raid 1866 bar. Two years later, with the passage of a Militia Act of 1868, the Naval Companies of Garden Island, Toronto, Hamilton, Dunnville and Port Stanley were requested to signal their intention to remain in active service. All the units, including Hamilton, failed to meet the February 1869 deadline and therefore Hamilton's first, formal naval reserve unit ceased to exist.  First World War (1914‚Äì1918)  When the Royal Canadian Navy was formed on 4 May 1910, there was no corresponding naval reserve until 1914 when the Royal Navy Canadian Volunteer Reserve (RNCVR) was stood up with minimal government support. Two years later, in 1916, the Hamilton Committee was formed to recruit sailors for the overseas division new RNCVR. The Committee included well known Hamiltonians, such as Hamilton city Alderman Captain George J. Guy and John H. Collinson, the first Headmaster of Highfield School for Boys.  Between the wars (1923‚Äì1939)  On 31 January 1923, Privy Council Order #139 established the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve (RCNVR) and on 15 March 1923 Lieutenant Ralph H. Yeates was appointed as the first commanding officer of the Hamilton Half Company (RCNVR). The Half Company initially shared offices with the Navy League in the Imperial Building on the corner of Main Street East & Hughson Street South in Hamilton. On 2 November 1923, the Half Company moved into the W. Grant Sail Loft on the corner of Bay Street North and Burlington Streets, sharing its building with Sea Cadets who had been formed six years earlier. On 2 July 1935, the Hamilton Half Company moved to the Williamson & Company Vinegar Works building at 41 Stuart Street, between Bay & MacNab where it stayed until 1943.  Second World War (1939‚Äì1945)  On 1 November 1941, the Hamilton Half Company was commissioned as HMCS Star and became a major recruiting depot and wartime training barracks for the Royal Canadian Navy and the Women's Royal Canadian Naval Service (WRCNS). As late as 14 October 1941, the unit was considered to be called HMCS Brant, but the name was changed, likely to avoid confusion with a recently launched corvette . On 7 May 1942 it was announced by the Navy that each major naval reserve unit would help meet the growing demand for technically skilled sailors within the fleet by training personnel in specialist skills. Shifting from a purely recruiting role and now to one of specialist training, Star was assigned to train new sailors in radio and electrical engineering. With that, 130 young men from across Canada were assigned to Hamilton and their training was divided between Star, Westdale Technical School (radio work) and Hamilton Technical Institute (electrical engineering). Due to the large complement of sailors at Star, a full medical and dental service was added to the unit. In the winter of 1942, the University Naval Training Division (UNTD) concept was introduced in Hamilton by Professor A. W. \\"Jack\\" Baker, when he stood up an experimental reserve training division at the Ontario Agricultural College (OAC) in Guelph. Attached to HMCS Star for the school term, Baker aimed to establish other Naval Training Units at universities across Canada to secure recruits who will otherwise enter the army's COTC Canadian Officers Training Corps or the air force's University Air Training Plan (UATP). In February 1943, with the success of the UNTD in Guelph, Professor Baker was brought into the RCNVR as an Acting Lieutenant Commander (SB) and appointed to the position of Staff Officer University Naval Training at McMaster University in Hamilton. Under Naval Order 2854 dated 19 June 1943, he set out across the country to establish 15 UNTDs. By the time the UNTD program was shut down in 1968, over 7,800 reserve officers were commissioned, of which 500 had trained at Star; and of whom fifty-three lost their lives during the Second World War. On 1 February 1943, the Department of National Defence purchased near Eastwood Park from the City of Hamilton to accommodate the growing unit. On 24 April 1943, the foundations were laid for a new HMCS Star building, with the opening occurred six months later. Intended as a prototype for Naval Reserve structures, the building demonstrated good craftsmanship and handling of materials. At this time, HMCS Star had a strength of approximately one thousand personnel with 681 in trades training, 281 undergoing basic training and 56 officers. Between 1941 and 1945, HMCS Star enlisted and trained 7,490 officers, men, and women for service during the Second World War and Hamilton sailors were to display dauntless courage and resourcefulness during the war. The Distinguished Service Medal was awarded to Chief Petty Officer Donald Portree, Torpedoman Dan Gearing and Signaller Eugine Tobin.  Cold War (1945‚Äì1989)  Following the Second World War, HMCS Star returned to a peacetime footing, reactivating in October 1946 as a reserve division. In June 1949, a party of sailors from the unit made a visit to former RCN corvettes being readied to be scrapped at Hamilton's steel mills. Their visit was to salvage whatever material would be of instructional value to the Division and to bring back memories to those that served on the ships during the war. In the same month the wardroom at Star was the first wardroom in the Royal Canadian Navy to be fitted with a television receiver, with programs coming in from as far as Buffalo, New York. In July 1949, a training programme for naval reserve air maintenance personnel was announced to be opened at HMCS Star. The program featured specialist training and instruction in naval aircraft maintenance for 100 personnel. Full training equipment, including Supermarine Seafire aircraft was provided by RCN Air Station, HMCS Shearwater, with training being conducted in addition to the normal week-day drill. In August 1949, HMCS Star provided a Fairmile-B class motor launch, two harbour craft, a cutter and two whalers to Exercise \\"Operation Seahorse\\" carried out in the Burlington Beach area. This navy, army and air force reserve exercise included transferring Royal Canadian Army Service Corps personnel and supplies from boats to amphibious DUKWS and then to shore while under aerial attack. The ships from Star succeeded in landing the army force, while Air Force reserve pilots conducted low level strafing attack and flour bag \\"bombardment\\" on the attackers. Earlier that same year, HMCS Star personnel aboard HMCS Portage participated in a similar inter-service assault landing exercise at Port Stanley, Ontario. In January 1950, the HMCS Star Boxing Club was formed from the ship's company and the Hamilton Sea Cadet corps. The club staged fights with bouts between the Star crew and fighters from the Ontario Agricultural College of Guelph and Shamrock Athletic Club of Hamilton. During the same year, HMCS Star operationalized its first radar set conducting training and tracking ships entering and exiting Hamilton Harbour. In June 1950, the unit sent its Fairmile-B class motor launch, PTC 706, to partake in exercise \\"Operation Beaver\\", a tri-service reserve beach assault manoeuvre at Port Stanley, Ontario. The exercise involved land units, including the Elgin Regiment, Kent Regiment, Essex Fusiliers and the Windsor Essex Scottish Regiment; sea units, including PTC 779 from HMCS Prevost, PTC 762 from HMCS Hunter and PTC 706 from HMCS Star; and 11 aircraft from the No. 420 City of London Auxiliary Squadron, RCAF. During that same summer, PTC 706 spent weekends away from Star conducting various evolutions and making Ports of call to Port Dalhousie, Toronto, Youngstown, Cobourg, and Rochester, New York. In mid-August 1950, PTC 706 joined the minesweeper HMCS Portage and other Fairmiles from Toronto and Kingston for fleet manoeuvres off Presq'ile. In November 1950, when hurricane winds caused by the Great Appalachian Storm struck the head of Lake Ontario and waves washed away lake shore cottages from Van Wagners beach, approximately 50 officers and sailors from Star and UNTD Guelph were amongst the first to respond as rescue crews. The sailors filled and placed heavy sandbags on temporary dikes, rigged lifelines and helped in other ways. In the midst of the rescue operation, the sailors were recalled back to the unit to rescue three Fairmiles (PTC 706, PTC 721 and PTC 761), turned over to a Hamilton yard for winter storage, that had broken their lines. In 1951, a new reserve summer Great Lakes Training Scheme was set up to provide basic naval training on the Great Lakes for new recruits and officers. Administered by the commanding officer of HMCS Prevost, Commander F.R.K. Naften, the program was conceived to provide seagoing experience for men of the RCN(R) who have not completed the six-month new entry training program. Before being sent to ships and fleet establishments, until they were considered sufficiently trained, the new scheme was intended to give new sailors the experience they needed on the Great Lakes. With six motor launches at his disposal, the new Reserve Training Commander Great Lakes called upon PTCs from HMCS Star, York, Cataraqui, Prevost, Hunter and Griffin to form the \\"Fairmile Flotilla\\". From 16 to 17 June, the flotilla conducted its first task, \\"Operation Beaver II\\", a 1,700 reserve troop tri-service amphibious landing and airdrop exercise at Erieau. Prior to the amphibious landing of nearly 500 army troops on three beaches from the Fairmiles, PTC 716 from York laid a smokescreen and paratroopers from the 1st Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment captured an airfield at nearby Chatham to allow friendly air support. Buzzing the \\"enemy\\" craft and ground troops with flour bags, a squadron of Harvard and Mustang aircraft, from No. 420 City of London Auxiliary Squadron, RCAF took on the role of enemy air forces. After the successful exercise, the flotilla spent the rest of the summer conducting other sailing activities and evolutions on Lake Ontario, Lake Huron, and Lake Superior before returning to their units. In 1954, HMCS Star, stood up a sub-unit (tender) located in Kitchener, Ontario between, in addition to its location at Hamilton. The unit was closed in 1964 In 1952, HMCS Stars importance as a naval training facility was bolstered by the establishment of the Great Lakes Training Centre (Fleet School Hamilton), making Hamilton the summer home to thousands of naval reservists from all over Canada. In 1953, HMCS Star gained another neighbor, HMCS Patriot, another stone frigate transplanted from Halifax, Nova Scotia. Established now in Hamilton, HMCS Patriot housed the Commanding Officer, Naval Divisions (COND), the forerunner to today's Royal Canadian Naval Reserve Command Headquarters. Previously based in Toronto during the Second World War under the title Commanding Officer, Reserve Divisions (CORD), COND now supervised 21 naval divisions across Canada and directed the summer operations of the Great Lakes fleet reserve training ships, , , and former air force supply vessel , permanently stationed at HMCS Star for use by the reservists. In 1953, a Naval Reserve Air Squadron (No. 1 Training Air Group) was established at in Toronto sending HMCS Star one Hawker Hurricane and two Supermarine Seafire aircraft to be housed at RCAF Station Hamilton, now known as the John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport. Not given its own squadron, due to its close proximity to Toronto, the crew from HMCS Star maintained a support unit for ground crew and maintenance conducting joint training with HMCS York at RCAF Station Downsview in Toronto. With the unification of the Canadian Armed Forces in the mid-1960s, significant changes came to HMCS Star. In 1964, The Great Lakes Training Centre was disbanded, as was the naval air arm maintenance unit. In 1967, The Hamilton Service Battalion and The Hamilton Medical Company, later renamed 23 Service Battalion and 23 Medical Company, took over HMCS Patriot /COND building after the closure of their Burlington Street Armoury in September of that year. In 1969, the base now called Canadian Forces Reserve Barracks Hamilton was placed under control of CFB Toronto.  Post Cold War (1990‚Äìpresent)  On 27 September 1997, HMCS Star officially opened their new state-of-the-art building, replacing all of the original World War II-era buildings that had housed the Division since its commissioning in 1941. In 2003, HMCS Haida, the destroyer known as ‚ÄúCanada‚Äôs most fightingest ship‚Äù - now a National Historic Site run by Parks Canada - was moved to a site directly in front of HMCS Star, now serving as a lasting memorial to the veterans of Canada's Navy, and a testament to the ongoing connection between Hamilton and this heritage. Today, HMCS Star is the home to over 200 naval reservists and generates trained individuals and teams for Royal Canadian Navy's domestic and international operations, while at the same time supporting the Canadian Armed Forces efforts to connect with Canadians through the maintenance of a broad national presence.

These processes apply to photochemistry, optically pumped lasers, sensitized solar cells, luminescence, and photochromism. Electron excitation After absorbing energy, an electron may jump from the ground state to a higher energy excited state. Electron excitation is the movement of an electron to a higher energy state. This can either be done by photoexcitation (PE), where the original electron absorbs the photon and gains all the photon's energy or by electrical excitation (EE), where the original electron absorbs the energy of another, energetic electron. Within a semiconductor crystal lattice, thermal excitation is a process where lattice vibrations provide enough energy to move electrons to a higher energy band. When an excited electron falls back to a lower energy state again, it is called electron relaxation. This can be done by radiation of a photon or giving the energy to a third spectator particle as well. In physics there is a specific technical definition for energy level which is often associated with an atom being excited to an excited state. The excited state, in general, is in relation to the ground state, where the excited state is at a higher energy level than the ground state. Photoexcitation Photoexcitation is the mechanism of electron excitation by photon absorption, when the energy of the photon is too low to cause photoionization. The absorption of the photon takes place in accordance with Planck's quantum theory. Photoexcitation plays role in photoisomerization. Photoexcitation is exploited in dye-sensitized solar cells, photochemistry, luminescence, optically pumped lasers, and in some photochromic applications. thumb Photoisomerization Photoisomerization of azobenzene In chemistry, photoisomerization is molecular behavior in which structural change between isomers is caused by photoexcitation. Both reversible and irreversible photoisomerization reactions exist. However, the word \\"photoisomerization\\" usually indicates a reversible process. Photoisomerizable molecules are already put to practical use, for instance, in pigments for rewritable CDs, DVDs, and 3D optical data storage solutions. In addition, recent interest in photoisomerizable molecules has been aimed at molecular devices, such as molecular switches, molecular motors, and molecular electronics. Photoisomerization behavior can be roughly categorized into several classes. Two major classes are trans-cis (or 'E-'Z) conversion, and open-closed ring transition. Examples of the former include stilbene and azobenzene. This type of compounds has a double bond, and rotation or inversion around the double bond affords isomerization between the two states. Examples of the latter include fulgide and diarylethene. This type of compounds undergoes bond cleavage and bond creation upon irradiation with particular wavelengths of light. Still another class is the Di-pi-methane rearrangement. Photoionization Photoionization is the physical process in which an incident photon ejects one or more electrons from an atom, ion or molecule. This is essentially the same process that occurs with the photoelectric effect with metals. In the case of a gas or single atoms, the term photoionization is more common. The ejected electrons, known as photoelectrons, carry information about their pre-ionized states. For example, a single electron can have a kinetic energy equal to the energy of the incident photon minus the electron binding energy of the state it left. Photons with energies less than the electron binding energy may be absorbed or scattered but will not photoionize the atom or ion. For example, to ionize hydrogen, photons need an energy greater than 13.6 electronvolts (the Rydberg energy), which corresponds to a wavelength of 91.2 nm. For photons with greater energy than this, the energy of the emitted photoelectron is given by: : { mv^2 \\\\over 2 } = h u - 13.6 eV where h is Planck's constant and ŒΩ is the frequency of the photon. This formula defines the photoelectric effect. Not every photon which encounters an atom or ion will photoionize it. The probability of photoionization is related to the photoionization cross-section, which depends on the energy of the photon and the target being considered. For photon energies below the ionization threshold, the photoionization cross-section is near zero. But with the development of pulsed lasers it has become possible to create extremely intense, coherent light where multi-photon ionization may occur. At even higher intensities (around 1015 \\\\- 1016 W/cm2 of infrared or visible light), non-perturbative phenomena such as barrier suppression ionization and rescattering ionization are observed. Multi-photon ionization Several photons of energy below the ionization threshold may actually combine their energies to ionize an atom. This probability decreases rapidly with the number of photons required, but the development of very intense, pulsed lasers still makes it possible. In the perturbative regime (below about 1014 W/cm2 at optical frequencies), the probability of absorbing N photons depends on the laser-light intensity I as IN . Above threshold ionization (ATI) is an extension of multi-photon ionization where even more photons are absorbed than actually would be necessary to ionize the atom. The excess energy gives the released electron higher kinetic energy than the usual case of just-above threshold ionization. More precisely, the system will have multiple peaks in its photoelectron spectrum which are separated by the photon energies, this indicates that the emitted electron has more kinetic energy than in the normal (lowest possible number of photons) ionization case. The electrons released from the target will have approximately an integer number of photon-energies more kinetic energy. In intensity regions between 1014 W/cm2 and 1018 W/cm2, each of MPI, ATI, and barrier suppression ionization can occur simultaneously, each contributing to the overall ionization of the atoms involved. Photo- Dember In semiconductor physics the Photo-Dember effect (named after its discoverer H. Dember) consists in the formation of a charge dipole in the vicinity of a semiconductor surface after ultra-fast photo-generation of charge carriers. The dipole forms owing to the difference of mobilities (or diffusion constants) for holes and electrons which combined with the break of symmetry provided by the surface lead to an effective charge separation in the direction perpendicular to the surface. Grotthuss‚ÄìDraper law The Grotthuss‚ÄìDraper law (also called the Principle of Photochemical Activation) states that only that light which is absorbed by a system can bring about a photochemical change. Materials such as dyes and phosphors must be able to absorb \\"light\\" at optical frequencies. This law provides a basis for fluorescence and phosphorescence. The law was first proposed in 1817 by Theodor Grotthuss and in 1842, independently, by John William Draper. This is considered to be one of the two basic laws of photochemistry. The second law is the Stark‚ÄìEinstein law, which says that primary chemical or physical reactions occur with each photon absorbed. Stark‚ÄìEinstein law The Stark‚ÄìEinstein law is named after German-born physicists Johannes Stark and Albert Einstein, who independently formulated the law between 1908 and 1913. It is also known as the photochemical equivalence law or photoequivalence law. In essence it says that every photon that is absorbed will cause a (primary) chemical or physical reaction. The photon is a quantum of radiation, or one unit of radiation. Therefore, this is a single unit of EM radiation that is equal to Planck's constant (h) times the frequency of light. This quantity is symbolized by Œ≥, hŒΩ, or ƒßœâ. The photochemical equivalence law is also restated as follows: for every mole of a substance that reacts, an equivalent mole of quanta of light are absorbed. The formula is: : \\\\Delta E_{mol} = N_A h u where NA is Avogadro's number. The photochemical equivalence law applies to the part of a light-induced reaction that is referred to as the primary process (i.e. absorption or fluorescence). In most photochemical reactions the primary process is usually followed by so-called secondary photochemical processes that are normal interactions between reactants not requiring absorption of light. As a result, such reactions do not appear to obey the one quantum‚Äìone molecule reactant relationship. The law is further restricted to conventional photochemical processes using light sources with moderate intensities; high-intensity light sources such as those used in flash photolysis and in laser experiments are known to cause so-called biphotonic processes; i.e., the absorption by a molecule of a substance of two photons of light. Absorption In physics, absorption of electromagnetic radiation is the way by which the energy of a photon is taken up by matter, typically the electrons of an atom. Thus, the electromagnetic energy is transformed to other forms of energy, for example, to heat. The absorption of light during wave propagation is often called attenuation. Usually, the absorption of waves does not depend on their intensity (linear absorption), although in certain conditions (usually, in optics), the medium changes its transparency dependently on the intensity of waves going through, and the Saturable absorption (or nonlinear absorption) occurs. Photosensitization Photosensitization is a process of transferring the energy of absorbed light. After absorption, the energy is transferred to the (chosen) reactants. This is part of the work of photochemistry in general. In particular this process is commonly employed where reactions require light sources of certain wavelengths that are not readily available. For example, mercury absorbs radiation at 1849 and 2537 angstroms, and the source is often high-intensity mercury lamps. It is a commonly used sensitizer. When mercury vapor is mixed with ethylene, and the compound is irradiated with a mercury lamp, this results in the photodecomposition of ethylene to acetylene. This occurs on absorption of light to yield excited state mercury atoms, which are able to transfer this energy to the ethylene molecules, and are in turn deactivated to their initial energy state. Cadmium; some of the noble gases, for example xenon; zinc; benzophenone; and a large number of organic dyes, are also used as sensitizers. Photosensitisers are a key component of photodynamic therapy used to treat cancers. Sensitizer A sensitizer in chemiluminescence is a chemical compound, capable of light emission after it has received energy from a molecule, which became excited previously in the chemical reaction. A good example is this: When an alkaline solution of sodium hypochlorite and a concentrated solution of hydrogen peroxide are mixed, a reaction occurs: :ClO‚àí(aq) + H2O2(aq) ‚Üí O2*(g) + H+(aq) + Cl‚àí(aq) + OH‚àí(aq) O2*is excited oxygen ‚Äì meaning, one or more electrons in the O2 molecule have been promoted to higher-energy molecular orbitals. Hence, oxygen produced by this chemical reaction somehow 'absorbed' the energy released by the reaction and became excited. This energy state is unstable, therefore it will return to the ground state by lowering its energy. It can do that in more than one way: *it can react further, without any light emission *it can lose energy without emission, for example, giving off heat to the surroundings or transferring energy to another molecule *it can emit light The intensity, duration and color of emitted light depend on quantum and kinetical factors. However, excited molecules are frequently less capable of light emission in terms of brightness and duration when compared to sensitizers. This is because sensitizers can store energy (that is, be excited) for longer periods of time than other excited molecules. The energy is stored through means of quantum vibration, so sensitizers are usually compounds which either include systems of aromatic rings or many conjugated double and triple bonds in their structure. Hence, if an excited molecule transfers its energy to a sensitizer thus exciting it, longer and easier to quantify light emission is often observed. The color (that is, the wavelength), brightness and duration of emission depend upon the sensitizer used. Usually, for a certain chemical reaction, many different sensitizers can be used. List of some common sensitizers *Violanthrone *Isoviolanthrone *Fluorescein *Rubrene *9,10-Diphenylanthracene *Tetracene *13,13'-Dibenzantronile *Levulinic Acid Fluorescence spectroscopy Fluorescence spectroscopy aka fluorometry or spectrofluorometry, is a type of electromagnetic spectroscopy which analyzes fluorescence from a sample. It involves using a beam of light, usually ultraviolet light, that excites the electrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to emit light of a lower energy, typically, but not necessarily, visible light. A complementary technique is absorption spectroscopy. Devices that measure fluorescence are called fluorometers or fluorimeters. Absorption spectroscopy Absorption spectroscopy refers to spectroscopic techniques that measure the absorption of radiation, as a function of frequency or wavelength, due to its interaction with a sample. The sample absorbs energy, i.e., photons, from the radiating field. The intensity of the absorption varies as a function of frequency, and this variation is the absorption spectrum. Absorption spectroscopy is performed across the electromagnetic spectrum.

Founded in 1976, it is Australia's only dedicated yacht racing magazine.http://www.theyachtmarket.com/news/109.aspx Overview Once the repository for all sailing results at a national level in Australia, the results were moved to the magazine's sailing website.www.mysailing.com.au The readership includes owners and crew of the 100 ft maxis, keelboat racers, dinghy and sailboard racers. History Australian Sailing was founded by Bob Ross http://www.nsw.yachting.org.au/?page=16053& and Ken McLachlan in September 1976. Ross came from a newspaper background and entered boating journalism via Modern Boating magazine. McLachlan was an advertising salesman. A New Zealander by birth, Ross spent his early years in the Finn dinghy, in which he competed for Olympic selection in 1964 and 1968. He also raced competitively in J24s and offshore events including the Sydney-Hobart, winning the 1986 Sydney-Mooloolaba race as co-helmsman aboard Nuzulu. In 1996 he won the Robert Greaves Achievement Award which recognises outstanding contributions to the boating industry. He wasn't able to attend the award ceremony because he was covering yachting at the Olympic Games at the time. He has covered every major world yachting event, including every America's Cup since 1962, Admirals Cups and Olympic sailing. In 1986 Ross and McLachlan sold the magazine to Yaffa Publishing, a privately held company which publishes business-to-business and specialist consumer magazines from its Surry Hills (NSW) base. Ross remained editor of Sailing until December 2003, when he handed over to Vanessa Dudley. One of the first women to compete against the men in 18 ft skiffs, as skipper of Nutrimetics, Dudley also had credentials in dinghy and offshore racing. She has completed 15 Sydney to Hobart races. Dudley was editor of Australian Sailing until June 2009.http://www.marinebusiness-world.com/index.cfm?nid=58436 In 2009, during the height of the Global Financial Crisis, the frequency was reduced from monthly to eight issues a year. During the winter months the publication comes out every second month. Roger McMillan was editor from July 2009 until November 2013. McMillan began his journalism career and his interest in sailing in New Zealand, where he cruised a small Spencer-designed keelboat offshore from Auckland. Moving to Australia in 1986 he built a 37 ft Van de Stadt and sailed it short-handed and solo from Western Australia to Sydney via Cape Leeuwin, the Great Australian Bight and the Bass Strait. In November 2013 Roger McMillan was replaced by Kimberley Wilmot as editor of the magazine and the frequency of the magazine reduced to six issues per year. Notable Contributors David Dellenbaugh was tactician aboard the 1992 America's Cup winning boat America Cubed and publishes a bi-monthly newsletter specialising in yacht racing tactics. Tony Bull is a sailmaker and offshore racing consultant who provides a monthly column on faster sailing. Andrew Verdon is the strength and conditioning coach for the Australian Sailing Team. His column offers advice on preparation for race days. Will Oxley is a racing navigator who has completed more than 200,000 nm of ocean miles including three round the world races and 11 Sydney to Hobart races. Most recently he provided navigation and weather support for Puma in the 2008‚Äì09 Volvo Ocean Race. Bob Ross is the founding editor of Australian Sailing and contributes a monthly article on a variety of subjects from practical issues such as hull preparation and sailcloth to profiles of sailors. Vanessa Dudley is also a former editor of the magazine and is a World Masters Laser Radial Gold Medallist. She has helmed 18 ft skiffs, completed 15 Sydney to Hobart races and written about all major yacht races including the Olympic Games. Dudley contributes a monthly Masterclass, concentrating on preparation and racing in off-the-beach classes.

Presently, there are already regulatory mechanisms in place that establish Britain's commitment to this kind of building construction. The government, for instance, set out a target that by 2016, all new homes will have zero carbon emission and it also includes a progressive tightening of energy efficiency regulations by 25 percent and 44 percent in 2010 and 2013, respectively. The UK Building Regulations set requirements for insulation levels and other aspects of sustainability in building construction. For the private sector, there is the case of the Association for Environment Conscious Building (AECB), which promotes green building (or sustainable building) in the United Kingdom since 1989. The UK is also bound to the European Union policy covering green buildings. Under the Energy Performance of Building Directive (EPBD), Europe has made a mandatory energy certification since 4 January 2009. A mandatory certificate called the Building Energy Rating system (BER) and a certification Energy Performance Certificate is needed by all buildings that measure more than 1,000 m2 in all the European nations. According to the UK Green Building Council, existing buildings account for 17 percent of the UK's total carbon emissions. The Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), UK's first green building certification system, was established in 1990. Houses are also rated according to the standards set by the Code of Sustainable Homes, which was established in 2007. Here, homes are evaluated against a minimum standards for energy and water usage and are rated from one to six stars based on how they meet the requirements in nine different categories. In Wales, advice on and access to sustainable building is available from a not-for-profit organisation called Rounded Developments Enterprises.Rounded Developments Enterprises They run a Sustainable Building Centre in Cardiff. Examples The Beaufort Court at Hertfordshire, which hosts the RES and Inbuilt, is an example of a green building in the UK. It is a zero-emission structure built on the previous Ovaltine egg farm and features its own 225-kilowatt wind turbine and photovoltaic array, capable of 3,200 kilowatt-hours per year. There is also the case of the BowZed building in east London, which made it to The Guardian's list of top eco-building. It is a block of zero-fossil energy flats designed by eco-architect Bill Dunster. It features comprehensive insulation, eliminating the need for a central heating system. About 90 percent of its electricity is sourced from solar and wind power while a wood pellet-powered boiler provides hot water to the residents. The One Angle Square building in Manchester has the distinction of earning one of the highest BREEAM scores. This structure makes use of natural resources with the passive solar gain for heating and natural ventilation through its double-skin facade. It also harvests rainwater and has sophisticated water recycling technology. Another popular green building in the UK is the Media Centres' Friendly Street building.

The 194th overall episode of the series, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 11, 2009. In the episode, Eric Cartman becomes the reader of the elementary school announcements, and starts making politically charged accusations against student body president Wendy Testaburger. The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States and M (as) in Australia. \\"Dances with Smurfs\\" served as a parody of the political commentary style of Glenn Beck, a nationally syndicated radio show host and former Fox News Channel pundit. The episode also satirized the 2009 James Cameron film Avatar, suggesting the plot of that film borrows heavily from the 1990 film Dances with Wolves, and comparing Avatars blue aliens to the cartoon Smurfs. It also included references to the Tea Party protests, radio personality Casey Kasem, and former-vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. The episode received generally positive reviews. According to Nielsen ratings, \\"Dances with Smurfs\\" was seen by 1.47 million households among viewers aged between 18 and 34.  Plot  Gordon Stoltski, a third grader who reads the South Park Elementary morning announcements, is shot to death by a jealous husband mistaking him for a 40-year-old truck driver with a similar name who had an affair with his wife, which the entire school hears due to it being heard over the intercom. During a memorial service at the gymnasium, guidance counselor Mr. Mackey announces the school will seek a replacement. Eric Cartman gets the job after sabotaging the efforts of a talented student named Casey Miller. However, during his first announcement, Cartman is very critical of the school and makes politically charged accusations against student body president Wendy Testaburger. Principal Victoria asks Cartman to stick to the script during announcements, but he accuses her of trying to silence him, and brings in the American Civil Liberties Union to ensure his freedom of speech. Cartman's announcements are soon broadcast as the politically themed \\"EC\\" show on televisions placed in each classroom. On his set's chalkboard, he uses the first letters of an acronym to make keywords that he writes to spell out Wendy's intent to \\"kill Smurfs\\" which concerns Butters and some other students. When they confront Wendy, she simply refuses to acknowledge Cartman. Cartman starts selling copies of his book, What Happened to My School?, outside the cafeteria where Stan Marsh confronts him. Angry because of Cartman's outrageous sexual lies about Wendy in his book, Stan tries to convince Cartman to stop selling the books to no avail. Stan then goes to Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey again, who confront Cartman, and force him to stop selling his books on school grounds. This upsets Cartman, who accuses them of turning the school into a \\"socialist horror-land\\", and insists he is leaving the school. The next day, however, he appears on his show and spins a portrayal of himself in blue face-paint and suspenders, having somehow found Smurfland, becoming part of Smurf culture and eventually falling in love with Smurfette. Cartman then claims that Wendy bulldozed Smurfland and slaughtered the Smurfs to get their valuable Smurfberries, the complete story of which he has chronicled in his DVD docudrama, \\"Dances with Smurfs\\". Despite the fact that it is extremely obvious that the footage of \\"Wendy\\" was Cartman in disguise, Butters Stotch and a furious mob of students go to Wendy's house to confront her. Butters pees on her front door and demands that she go on Cartman's morning announcements show to answer his questions. On the \\"EC\\" set the next morning a reluctant Wendy joins Cartman (who has his sideburns dyed gray in make-up) who promises he will stick to school-related questions and go easy on her. However, as soon as filming begins, he immediately asks about her rumoured promiscuity and involvement in the Smurf genocide. To Cartman's surprise, Wendy claims she indeed bulldozed Smurfland to get the valuable Smurfberries, but alludes that Cartman was involved with the plot, and that the Smurfs would have left Smurfland if Cartman had not integrated himself with them. She steps down as student body president, turning the title over to Cartman, and announces her own new book Going Rogue on the Smurfs. Cartman is angry that she has turned the tables on him and stolen his Smurf idea, particularly when she announces she sold the movie rights to filmmaker James Cameron, who turned the book into his new film, Avatar. With being the student body president, Cartman can't do the morning announcements anymore because a student can't hold both positions at the same time. Cartman, much to his anger, also learns that being the student body president is a meaningless position with no real power. The episode ends with Casey Miller reading the announcements, which include a student's explicit letter of disgust for Cartman's performance as president, causing him to run out the room crying, \\"I'm doing the best I can!\\" Production \\"Dances with Smurfs\\" was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. It first aired on November 11, 2009, in the United States on Comedy Central. The episode marked the final appearance of Gordon Stoltski, the third grade student who read the morning announcements for South Park Elementary. The day after \\"Dances with Smurfs\\" was originally broadcast, four T-shirts based on the episode were made available at South Park Studios, the official South Park website. All four featured Cartman wearing a suit and tie, saying a quote from the episode. These included \\"I'm not some dog on a leash\\", \\"We're in the poop box, my friends\\", \\"I'm a normal kid... I just ask questions\\", and \\"I ask questions\\". Theme Political pundit Glenn Beck (pictured) and his commentary style were heavily satirized in \\"Dances with Smurfs\\" \\"Dances with Smurfs\\" served as a parody and social commentary of the political commentary style of Glenn Beck, a nationally syndicated radio show host and former Fox News Channel political pundit. Cartman makes outrageous claims with no basis for fact under the guise that he is simply asking rhetorical questions and seeking further discussion. Beck has been criticized for utilizing a similar style of commentary in his radio and television shows. Cartman's televised morning announcements are patterned after the Glenn Beck television program, using the same types of music and imagery, as well as a logo with the initials \\"EC\\" that closely resemble the logo of Beck's show, which use the initials \\"GB\\". Cartman also writes comments about Wendy on a blackboard, which is a prop often used by Beck on his television program. The day after \\"Dances with Smurfs\\" originally aired, Beck himself discussed the episode on his radio program. Beck said he had not watched the episode himself but took the parody as a compliment, and that he particularly enjoyed Cartman's hair, which was combed in a style similar to Beck. Steve \\"Stu\\" Burguiere, the executive producer of Beck's radio show, also complimented the episode, and said of Parker and Stone, \\"These guys skewer everybody and they are always very good at it.\\" Cultural references \\"Dances with Smurfs\\" satirized Avatar, the 2009 science-fiction epic film directed by James Cameron, which tells the story of humans in the distant future mining for minerals on an alien planet inhabited by blue natives. Although Avatar had not yet been released in theaters by the time the episode aired, the script of \\"Dances with Smurfs\\" compares the plot of Avatar to that of Dances with Wolves, a 1990 drama epic film in which a United States soldier becomes integrated with a tribe of Native Americans. At the end of \\"Dances with Smurfs\\", Cartman watches Avatar at a movie theater and grows angry that his idea was stolen, expressing the idea that Avatar borrows from other previous films. Avatar had already been compared to Dances with Wolves prior to the broadcast of \\"Dances with Smurfs\\", and James Cameron said he welcomed the comparison. Cartman's movie prominently features the Smurfs, a fictional group of small blue cartoon creatures, which draws a further parallel to the blue alien creatures in Avatar. The use of the cartoon Smurfs has also been interpreted as a joke that although Avatar had a famously large budget of hundreds of millions of dollars, the film amounted to little more than a Smurfs-like cartoon. On the commentary Trey Parker and Matt Stone described the Na'vi who are natives of Pandora in Avatar as \\"ten foot tall sexy Smurfs\\". When Wendy resigns as student body president, she announces the publication of her book, Going Rogue on the Smurfs. This is a reference to Going Rogue: An American Life, the 2009 autobiography of former United States Vice President candidate Sarah Palin, who had recently announced her resignation as Governor of Alaska. Casey Miller, the student who competes against Cartman for the morning announcements, heavily resembles and speaks in a manner similar to radio personality Casey Kasem.  Reception  In its original American broadcast on November 11, 2009, \\"Dances with Smurfs\\" was watched by 1.47 million overall households among viewers aged between 18 and 34, according to Nielsen ratings. It ranked behind a special 90-minute episode of Sons of Anarchy, the FX series about an outlaw motorcycle club, which was the most watched cable program of the week with 2.5 million households among 18‚Äì49 viewers..In total viewers, it was watched by 2.77 million total viewers and for viewers aged between 18 and 49, it earned a 1.5/4 A18-49 rating/share.http://yourentertainmentnow.com/2009/11/18/fxs-sons-of- anarchy-1-scripted-drama-among-a18-49-other-cable-tv-ratings/ The episode received generally positive reviews. Ramsey Isler of IGN said Cartman worked well for a Beck satire, and said, \\"The real accomplishment of this episode is how it totally roasted a semi-political figure, without being political at all.\\" However, Isler said the script loses focus with the appearance of the Smurfs, and that Gordon's death was disturbing and inappropriate in the light of recent school shootings in the United States. The A.V. Club writer Sean O'Neal, a vocal critic of Beck, said mocking Beck is an easy task, but the episode \\"handled it with just enough of the show's usual surrealist bent that it was never wholly predictable\\". He praised some of the episode's unexpected elements, like Cartman's Smurf film and Wendy's surprise resignation. Carlos Delgado of iF magazine said \\"Dances with Smurfs\\" became \\"a little strange\\" starting with Cartman's Smurf story, but he called the episode \\"smart, sharp, and poignant\\". Delgado said the episode had less \\"laugh out loud\\" humor than traditional South Park episodes, in favor of intelligent satire. AOL Television writer Donald Deane called it one of the funniest episodes of the season. Home release \\"Dances with Smurfs\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park's thirteenth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set and two-disc Blu-ray set in the United States on March 16, 2010. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode, a collection of deleted scenes, and a special mini-feature Inside Xbox: A Behind-the-Scenes Tour of South Park Studios, which discussed the process behind animating the show with Inside Xbox host Major Nelson.

It premiered on The WB on September 13, 2005, and was written by series creator Eric Kripke and directed by David Nutter. The Supernatural pilot introduced the characters of Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles), brothers who travel throughout the country hunting supernatural creatures, as they battled a ghostly Woman in White (Sarah Shahi) while searching for their missing father (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Kripke was developing the concept for ten years before it was greenlit as a television series. Before it could be filmed, the script underwent numerous revisions. The episode was produced in Los Angeles, though future episodes were filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, to save money. The episode established the series' tradition of a rock-music soundtrack, and included background music scored by Kripke's friend Christopher Lennertz. It received mixed reviews, with critics praising the horror elements but having varying opinions of the lead actors' performances. Plot In 1983 in Lawrence, Kansas, Mary Winchester (Samantha Smith) investigates a sound coming from her infant son Sam's nursery. She sees a figure standing over his crib, and confronts him. Her husband, John (Morgan), is awoken by her screams and finds her pinned to the ceiling with a slash across her stomach. She bursts into flames, and John is forced to evacuate the house with Sam and his older son, Dean, while the house erupts into flames. Twenty-two years later in 2005, Sam (Jared Padalecki) and his girlfriend Jessica Moore (Adrianne Palicki) celebrate his high LSAT score. Later that night, Dean (Jensen Ackles) shows up at Sam's home. Though the brothers have not spoken in years, Dean comes looking for help in finding their father, who disappeared while hunting a supernatural entity. After Sam hears a voicemail from his father that contains electronic voice phenomenon of a woman saying, \\"I can never go home,\\" he agrees to help Dean in the search. The brothers head to John's last known whereabouts‚Äîthe town of Jericho‚Äîwhere he had been investigating the disappearances of young men along a single stretch of road over ten years. Sam and Dean discover a local legend of a murdered girl who has returned as a homicidal, hitchhiking ghost. Research points to Constance Welch (Shahi), who jumped to her death off a nearby bridge after drowning her children. While they stakeout the bridge that night, Sam tells Dean he does not want to return to hunting supernatural creatures. He points out that finding whatever creature killed their mother‚Äîa task their father has dedicated his life to‚Äîwill not bring her back. The two are interrupted by a ghostly woman jumping off the bridge. Sam and Dean later check into a local motel, and discover their father is also renting a room there. They break into it and discover his research scattered all over the room; all his findings point to Constance being a woman in white. When Dean leaves the room to get food, he is arrested by the police, who believe he is connected to the disappearances. At the police station, they show him John's journal, and he notices the message \\"Dean 35-111\\" written inside it. As Dean is interrogated, Sam tracks down Constance's husband (Steve Railsback), and learns the locations of both her grave site and the house in which she drowned their children. Sam then fakes a 911 call so Dean can escape the station. However, Constance targets Sam in the Impala, demanding he take her home. Sam refuses, but she possesses the car so that it drives Sam to her home. Once they arrive at her old house, she attempts to seduce him, but when he resists, she attacks him. Dean forces her to temporarily dissipate by shooting her with rock salt, and Sam uses the opportunity to crash the car into the house. Constance reappears and attacks them, but the spirits of her children confront her. They embrace their mother, causing her to scream in pain as demonic like beings spawn from under her, dragging her down through the floor. It is revealed that the reason she could ‚Äònever go home‚Äô was because she was too afraid to confront her children. Dean deduces John's message was coordinates to where he has headed. Sam still does not want to join the search, so Dean drops him off at his apartment. Lying alone in bed, Sam discovers Jessica pinned to the ceiling with a slash across her stomach. She ignites into flames as Dean breaks in and rescues Sam. While firefighters attempt to put out the inferno, Sam decides to join his brother in the search for their father and the creature that killed their mother and Jessica. Production Development Series creator Eric Kripke had previously written for the WB series Tarzan, and was offered the chance to pitch show ideas to the network. He used the opportunity for Supernatural, a concept he had been developing for nearly ten years. Kripke envisioned Supernatural as a road trip series, deeming it the \\"best vehicle to tell these stories because it's pure, stripped down and uniquely American... These stories exist in these small towns all across the country, and it just makes so much sense to drive in and out of these stories.\\" Though the network rejected his initial pitch‚Äîa tabloid reporter investigates supernatural occurrences throughout the country‚Äîthey were still interested in a series featuring urban legends. Kripke quickly suggested a Route 66-style series, and the network loved it. Filming was greenlit after director David Nutter, who previously had worked with Kripke on Tarzan, signed on.Knight, p.10Knight, p.21 Cast and characters Ackles (left) and Padalecki (right) were the only actors to audition for the lead roles of Dean and Sam Winchester. The pilot stars Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles as Sam and Dean Winchester, whom Kripke likened to Luke Skywalker and Han Solo of Star Wars. Padalecki knew executive producers McG and Nutter, the former convincing him to audition for the role. He was excited to play \\"the reluctant hero\\", and compared Sam to The Matrix's Neo.Knight, p.126 However, Nutter also asked Ackles to audition for the role of Sam.Knight, p.130 Nutter and Kripke found themselves in a predicament, as they felt both actors were great as Sam. To remedy the situation, Warner Bros. president Peter Roth suggested Ackles instead audition for Dean. Kripke agreed, believing Ackles' \\"smart-ass attitude\\" made him \\"born to play\\" the Harrison Ford-like character, and Ackles preferred the character of Dean after reading the script. Both actors were the only ones to audition, and network executives instantly noticed a brotherly chemistry between them.Knight, p.11 Evil Dead-actor Bruce Campbell was Kripke's first choice to portray John Winchester, father of Sam and Dean. However, Campbell was unavailable, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan eventually received the role. With Morgan's scene taking place 22 years before the series, he expected to be replaced by an older actor for subsequent episodes, and was surprised when he was later asked to reprise the role.Knight, p.134 For the role of Constance Welch‚Äîthe Woman in White‚Äîproduction set out to find the \\"perfect actress\\". Nutter, a fan of The L Word, had watched an episode featuring actress Sarah Shahi one night during the casting process. He felt she was \\"really sharp\\" and a \\"fine actress\\", with a \\"seductive quality about her\\". Surprised when she came in to audition the following day, he knew she \\"had the job when she walked in the door\\". Because the scene involving Constance's husband Joseph Welch merely discusses Constance's backstory, the scene hinged on the actors' performances. Seeking a \\"great actor\\", Nutter recalled his previous experience working with Steve Railsback, and offered him the role. Other guest stars include Adrianne Palicki as Sam's girlfriend Jessica Moore, and Samantha Smith as Mary Winchester. The latter felt she landed the part due to her joking around with Nutter during the audition.Knight, p.138 Writing The episode was written by series creator Eric Kripke, who described its creation as a \\"very difficult, birthing process\\" due to the numerous rewrites required. The original version did not feature the Woman in White, and John Winchester died in the teaser. In the revised script, Sam and Dean Winchester were raised by their aunt and uncle instead of their father. Because of this, Sam is unaware that supernatural beings exist, and Dean must convince him of the truth when he asks for help. Kripke realized this made the backstory too complicated, and reworked it with co-executive producer Peter Johnson so that their father raised them to be hunters like him. This decision granted the brothers proficiency in both fighting and swindling people.Knight, pp.8‚Äì10 Other revised concepts included Sam believing Dean to be a serial killer who murdered their father,Knight, p.14 and John dying instead of Sam's girlfriend Jessica. The scene in which the brothers discuss their childhood and delve into their backstory was rewritten 20 to 30 times, and the final version was heavily trimmed. A gas-station scene within the episode was meant to establish what the brothers and the series are about‚Äîbantering, credit card scams, and classic rock; Kripke feared that it would be cut because it was character- based and did not further the episode's plot. He also did not want the series to feature ballad music typical of The WB network, and forced the use of classic rock for the soundtrack by writing the music into the script. For the episode's villain, Kripke used the well-known urban legend of the vanishing hitchhiker, but combined it with the Mexican legend of La Llorona to give the spirit more motivation and characterization.Knight, p.26 The ghost was younger in an earlier version of script, and murdered her parents instead of her children; this was revised to allow for the casting of an older actress. Originally, the studio did not want Kripke to kill Jessica at the episode's end, but rather keep her as a recurring character in the series. Kripke felt this would not fit the series's format, and decided to have her revealed as a demon, with the revelation prompting Sam to join Dean in hunting. However, with only a short amount of screentime available to depict this, Kripke believed it would be a \\"tough aspect to sell\\". Because Luke Skywalker only begins his journey after the deaths of his aunt and uncle, Kripke found it more appropriate for Sam's motivation to be Jessica's death. Thus, the character is killed in the same manner as Sam's mother, making the deaths the \\"right bookends\\".Knight, p.13 Filming Principal photography for the pilot took place in Los Angeles, though subsequent episodes of the series are filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia to save money. The bridge sequences were shot at Lake Piru, near a War of the Worlds filming location, and the library and phone booth scenes were filmed at an elementary school. Triplet babies portrayed Sam in the episode's teaser, and production found it difficult to get them to cry on cue. Though a real house served as the first-story level in the teaser, the upstairs was constructed on a sound stage because of the special effects required for Mary's fiery death. Script rewrites for the opening sequence‚Äîa better introduction for Sam was needed‚Äîrequired reshoots on the set of The O.C. two months after principal photography. Effects To depict the supernatural aspects of the show, the series makes use of visual, special, and make-up effects, as well as stuntwork. Businesses, such as visual effects company Entity FX, were contracted for production of the pilot episode. Subsequent episodes were filmed in Vancouver and required a new crew that works exclusively for the show. Mary Winchester's death scene, which had the character pinned to the ceiling and burning to death, required actress Samantha Smith to lie on a floor with two propane pipes spouting fire approximately five feet away from her on either side. For the actual burning of the character, a fake body the crew named \\"Christina\\" was made out of wire and papier-m√¢ch√©, and was then ignited on a fake ceiling.Knight, p.20 However, the room quickly caught fire, forcing an evacuation. Green screen coincided with the visual effects for the ghostly Woman in White, and executive producer McG chose to make the imagery of her death sequence an homage to Chris Cunningham's Aphex Twin video \\"Windowlicker\\". Japanese horror also influenced the scene, such as the school uniforms worn by the ghost children, the water cascading down the stairs, and the Dark Water elements. Music The episode's synthesized orchestral score was written by Christopher Lennertz, Kripke's friend and next-door neighbor. The two attended USC School of Cinematic Arts together, and worked together on various projects afterwards. Lennertz described Supernatural as \\"one of those dream situations where you get to work with someone who you admire, but also have a relationship with already\\", and noted he and Kripke \\"were already on the same page without even talking about [the series' music]\\". For the scenes involving Mary and Jessica's deaths at the hands of the demon Azazel, Lennertz used a piano solo with discordant notes and reverberations to create a \\"really nasty\\" sounding echo effect. He would later reuse this theme in the season one episode \\"Nightmare\\".Knight, p.78 The episode also included a number of rock songs, which would become a tradition for the series. Kripke wanted to feature the song \\"Enter Sandman\\", but Metallica would not grant permission.  Reception  In its original broadcast, the pilot was viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers. The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Diana Steenbergen of IGN, who was \\"hooked right away\\", gave the pilot episode a score of 8.5 out of 10. She felt it began \\"heartbreakingly\\", and the \\"genuinely scary\\" death scenes of Mary and Jess \\"will haunt...the viewers\\". Steenbergen praised both the writers and the lead actors for making the \\"[exposition scenes] still feel natural, for the most part\\", and noted Ackles and Padalecki were \\"instantly convincing as brothers\\". Also credited for this \\"well paced\\" episode was director David Nutter, who did an \\"excellent job of setting up the atmosphere and tone of the series\\". Likewise, BuddyTV's Don Williams posited, \\"It's about as good as a pilot can get.\\" He ranked it ninth out of his favorite episodes of the first three seasons, believing it introduces the characters \\"in a memorable fashion\\" and \\"wonderfully\\" establishes the show's universe. Robert Bianco of USA Today deemed the series as possibly \\"the simplest and the scariest\\" of the season's new dark shows, and wrote, \\"It wants nothing more than to frighten you ‚Äî and tonight, it does.\\" He noted the episode \\"[pulls] off a few surprises\\" and \\"works its way to an ending that lives up to Dean's 'no chick-flick moments'\\". However, Bianco criticized the \\"pauses for comic relief\\"; he felt Ackles' \\"comic touch\\" was \\"not yet as skillful as it needs to be\\", with Ackles' attempts at being \\"humorously annoying\\" leaving him \\"simply annoying\\". Despite the episode having a somewhat unoriginal villain and a \\"relatively simple\\" solution, Brian Lowry of Variety deemed the series' debut as \\"a promising plunge into the darkness\\". Lowry applauded Ackles, who \\"brings an easygoing charm and engaging wise-ass personality to the absurd notion of traveling the country with a trunk full of wooden stakes and holy water\\". Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times found the first half of the episode \\"quite effective\\", with the \\"camera angles, spooky music and jumpy sequences...[being] as frightening as those found in any horror movie, with an added twist of suspense\\". However, she deemed the depiction of the ghostly villain as \\"pretty silly\\", and noted the second half \\"stops building suspense and turns predictable\\". Calling the series \\"Ghostbusters' Creek\\", Stanley felt the episode \\"reverts to a WB family drama about the bonds between two mismatched brothers and their father\\". Similarly, Matthew Gilbert of the Boston Globe called Ackles and Padalecki \\"generic cuties who hold their lips together tightly, except to utter the word Dude\\". Although Gilbert noted there are a couple \\"moderately creepy\\" twists, he found there to be \\"nothing about the central family story in Supernatural or its bland actors that makes it addictive\\". Work on the pilot episode garnered two Emmy Award nominations in 2006. Lennertz was nominated in the category of \\"Outstanding Music Composition For A Series (Dramatic Underscore)\\", and the sound editors for \\"Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series\\".

It rises on the north-eastern slopes of Mount Cotton and flows directly to the Moreton Bay at Victoria Point. It is long with about of estuarine zone. In the latter, the water depth is typically about one to two m mid-stream, the width is about 20 to 30 m and the tides are semi-diurnal with a range of about two m. The catchment (~ 39 km2 area) is mostly urban in the lower reaches and semi rural/rural residential in the upper reaches. The creek includes several conservation areas such as Eprapah hosting endangered species, e.g. koalas, swamp wallabies, sea eagles. Water quality The water quality and ecology have been closely monitored at Eprapah Creek (Victoria Point, Queensland) over thirty years by Redland Shire Council, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and local community groups. The creek was heavily polluted in 1998 by illegal discharges of tributyl-tin (TBT) and chemical residues. Although the estuarine zone includes two environmental parks, there are some marinas and boat yards, and a major sewage plant discharge that affect the natural system. The upstream catchment has been adversely affected by large-scale poultry farms, wineries, land clearance and semi-urban development. The recent works included the constructions of new shopping centres and residential lots less than 500 metres from the estuary in 2003-04. Turbulent mixing in Eprapah Creek estuary Between 2003 and 2007, a series of field studies were performed in the estuarine zone of Eprapah Creek that is a typical small coastal plain type. The aim of these field studies was to investigate the turbulence and turbulent mixing properties in the estuarine zone. During these studies, high frequency turbulence and physio-chemistry data were collected continuously over a relatively long duration (up to 50 h), and the findings have direct implications on the modelling of small estuaries. The studies showed that the response of the turbulence and water quality properties were distinct under spring and neap tidal forcing and behaved differently in the middle and upper estuarine zones. The behaviour of turbulence properties to spring tidal forcing differed from that observed in larger estuaries and seemed unique to small estuarine systems. An investigation of several key turbulence parameters used in the modelling of estuarine mixing showed that many assumptions used in larger estuaries must be applied with caution or are simply untrue in small estuaries. For example, the assumption that the mixing coefficient parameters are constant over the tidal cycle in a small estuary is simply untrue. These distinctions between the turbulence and mixing properties in small and large estuarine systems highlight the need for the continued study of small estuaries, so this type of system can be properly understood. Like most small subtropical estuaries, Eprapah Creek is characterised by short-lived freshwater flushing, and basically no flow during the dry season. A recent field study highlighted the short-term impact of a rainstorm on a small subtropical estuary. The flushing appeared to be caused primarily by the rainfall runoff from the nearby shopping centres, parkings and roadways. In the estuary, the surface flows were dominated by the freshwater flushing including during the flood tide. Some strong vertical stratification of the water column was observed at all sampling locations, but the longitudinal distributions of dissolved oxygen and turbidity showed a quasi-homogeneous estuarine system, in sharp contrasts with dry weather data sets. The salinity data highlighted the advective diffusion of the freshwater plume. The observed saltwater intrusion data exhibited a dome-shaped intrusion curve, and the data followed an analytical model. The analytical solution provided a simple physical model of the salt dispersion in the alluvial estuary. It showed the significance of density-driven mixing in the upper estuary during wet weather conditions.

It seeks to plan on a longer-term basis than the usual year-to-year, appropriations-based practice, and to integrate diplomacy and development missions under one planning process. It similarly seeks to correlate the department‚Äôs missions with its capacities and identify shortfalls in resourcing. Finally, it is also a precursor to core institutional reforms and corrective changes. The first such review was completed as year 2010 drew to a close. A second such review began being conducted during 2014 and was released in April 2015. Objectives The final report of the QDDR lays out, in the department's own words: *The baseline: An assessment of (1) the range of global threats, challenges and opportunities both today and over the next two decades that should inform our diplomatic and development strategies; and (2) the current status of our approaches to diplomacy and development, with emphasis on the relationship between diplomacy and development in our existing policies and structures. *The ends: A clear statement of our overarching foreign policy and development objectives, our specific policy priorities, and our expected results, with an emphasis on the achievable and not merely the desirable. *The ways: A set of recommendations on the strategies needed to achieve these results, including the timing and sequencing of decisions and implementation. *The means: A set of recommendations on (1) the tools and resources needed to implement the strategy; and (2) management and organizational reforms that will improve outcomes and efficiency. *The metrics: A set of recommendations on performance measures to assess outcomes, and‚Äîwhere feasible‚Äîimpacts. *The links: An assessment of how the results and recommendations of this review fit into broader interagency, whole-of-government approaches, and into the Administration‚Äôs larger foreign policy framework. Announcement and initial reception On July 10, 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced the initiative at a State Department town hall meeting. The most ambitious of Clinton's departmental reforms, it is modeled after the U.S. Defense Department's Quadrennial Defense Review, which Clinton was familiar with from her days as a United States Senator on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Previously the American Academy of Diplomacy had determined that the Secretary of State ‚Äúlacks the tools ‚Äì people, competencies, authorities, programs and funding ‚Äì to execute the President‚Äôs foreign policies.‚Äù More fundamentally, the department did not even have a methodology in place to know how under- resourced it was. She appointed Deputy Secretary of State Jacob Lew, Director of Policy Planning Anne-Marie Slaughter, and the United States Agency for International Development Administrator to undertake the review. At the time of the announcement, that was the Acting USAID Administrator, Alonzo Fulgham. (On November 10, 2009, Rajiv Shah was nominated to be USAID Administrator.) The U.S. Department of Homeland Security also conducts an assessment process, the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, which is similar to the Defense's review. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence also has something of a similar mechanism. However, the State Department has fewer employees available to conduct such an intensive review as the Pentagon; less than a dozen are expected to be assigned to the QDDR staff, while the Defense Department employs about 100 people for theirs. The State Department also has less institutional experience with long-range planning, being more focused towards the management of immediate diplomatic crises, although the State Department created the Policy Planning Staff in 1947 to integrate long-range planning into the policy-making process. The disparity of resources between State and Defense and the allocation thereof raised questions about State's capacity to implement the planned review. Former U.S. Ambassador Ronald E. Neumann said that the QDDR was ‚Äúan intelligent measure‚Äù and that Secretary Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äúfocus on resources is important and has been too often neglected by secretaries of state who focused only on policy. She understood she‚Äôs not going to manage effectively with a busted institution.‚Äù The U.S. Global Leadership Coalition commended the creation of the QDDR, calling it \\"an important step toward elevating and strengthening the civilian-led tools of diplomacy and development.\\" The Project on National Security Reform said it was important for the QDDR to meld a top-down approach to managing resources to a bottom-up approach of examining the needs of each embassy abroad. The Heritage Foundation was skeptical, predicting that \\"the final QDDR product will repeat past mistakes by maintaining a focus on the traditional official government instruments of foreign aid and will fail to achieve the true integration of all the tools of U.S. foreign and security policy.\\" The Cato Institute was also skeptical, saying that the model, the Pentagon's Quadrennial Defense Review, had produced \\"a series of vacuous documents that commingle vague, unsubstantiated claims about great historical shifts underway ... with threat inflation. There is no evidence that these documents have produced much beyond wasted time and effort.\\" The first review The QDDR held its first meetings in October 2009 at the Willard InterContinental Washington, hosted by the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition. There, Deputy Secretary Lew took care to say that the review process was not cover for an attempt by the State Department to absorb USAID. Some 400 people attended, with many confused by the process and uncertain how they could influence it. The first Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review was completed in December 2010 and was entitled Leading Through Civilian Power; it was presented by Secretary Clinton and USAID Administrator Shah, to employees of both organizations gathered at a town hall meeting. The 150-page document outlined three key factors that would affect the State Department in coming years: limited financial resources due to U.S. budgetary constraints and political realities; a rapidly shifting global landscape that features power being spread across many countries and the prevalence of non-national actors; and the ability to respond to problems caused by weak states and incipient or actual conflict with a flexible corps of civilian expertise. The review also stressed one of Clinton's signature issues, the role of women around the world. It mentioned women and girls over a 130 times and embraced what became known as \\"the Hillary Doctrine\\" by saying, \\"The protection and empowerment of women and girls is key to the foreign policy and security of the United States.\\" The review set forth a possible bureaucratic overhaul of the State Department, with a number of goals: * elevation of \\"civilian power\\" * focus on conflict prevention * elevation of U.S. ambassadors in coordinating work of all abroad-tasked U.S. agencies * focus on the issues and needs of particular key 'regional hubs' in the world * defuse crises before violence; team with Defense Department if that fails * give USAID the Obama administration's global health and agriculture initiatives * create an undersecretary for civilian security * create bureaus for energy resources and counterterrorism * create new coordinator position for cyber issues Policy-planning director Anne-Marie Slaughter, the lead architect of the review, said that ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre trying to say to Congress is, we get it. We realize we‚Äôve got to prove to you and to the American people that we are good stewards of your money.‚Äù The U.S. Global Leadership Coalition viewed the release favorably, saying ‚ÄúThe QDDR represents a bold step toward implementing a smart-power foreign policy by elevating our civilian power and ensuring effective, results-driven programs.‚Äù The review would then go to Congress for its review, upon which prospect State Department officials expressed hopefulness; they also wanted Congress to approve making the QDDR a required, regular part of the State Department process. Clinton said, ‚ÄúI am determined that this report will not merely gather dust, like so many others.‚Äù Changes at State In implementing changes under the first review, State expanded the scope of two undersecretaries. The Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights succeeds the Under Secretary for Democracy and Global Affairs with a new Bureau of Counterterrorism (formerly the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism). The Under Secretary for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment succeeds the Under Secretary for Economic, Energy, and Agricultural Affairs and included the new Bureau of Energy Resources. Proposed legislation In June 2012, Senators John Kerry, Ben Cardin, and Marco Rubio introduced the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review Act of 2012, proposed legislation that would update U.S. foreign policy and assistance programs to reflect the ongoing challenges in the world by setting clear diplomatic and development priorities, assuring that U.S. efforts would be effective and efficient, and clarifying the way progress is evaluated. It passed in the Senate during 2012. Kerry tenure Once John Kerry became Secretary of State, speculation began on whether the department would conduct a second QDDR review. In February 2014, Kerry appointed Thomas Perriello to be Special Representative for the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, and then Kerry announced the public launch of the review in April 2014, with the goal being to \\"identify emerging policy and management priorities and the organizational capabilities needed to maximize the impact and efficiency of this nation's diplomacy and development investments.\\" The second review The second Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review was released on April 28, 2015. It outlined four worldwide priorities for the State Department and USAID: * Preventing and mitigating conflict and violent extremism * Promoting open, resilient, and democratic societies * Advancing inclusive economic growth * Mitigating and adapting to climate change References External links * \\"The Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review\\" ‚Äì State Department page Category:Reports of the United States government Category:United States Department of State Category:United States Department of State publications ","title":"Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review"},{"id":"25017954","text":"Ross Goodacre is a former association football player who represented New Zealand at an international level.

Biography A native of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Messmer began his athletic career at Milwaukee East High School. In 1904, Messmer set a national high school record in the discus throw. Messmer enrolled at the University of Wisconsin where he competed in track, football, baseball, swimming, water polo and crew, becoming the first Wisconsin athlete to win nine varsity letters in major sports. He was the captain of both the football and swim teams in 1907. In 1908, he was also selected by Walter Camp as a second-team All-American at the guard position. In a May 1908 meet in Chicago, Messmer threw for a distance of 129 feet, 9 inches (39.54 meters), a distance that would have taken the bronze medal two months later at the 1908 Olympics. He reportedly won every discus competition he ever entered. He qualified for the U.S. Olympic team in 1908 with the best discus throw in the country, but he withdrew from the Olympic team because of a brother's illness. Messmer was also a member of the University of Wisconsin baseball team that toured Japan in 1909. After graduating from the University of Wisconsin, Messmer worked as a surveyor in the Madison area. He later became an architect in Milwaukee and worked on the design and supervised construction of such buildings as the Elks Club and West Allis City Hall, churches, halls, schools, banks, Concordia College and some industrial buildings. He also served as the general superintendent of Milwaukee County construction from 1928 until his retirement in 1956. In 1959, Messmer was chosen unanimously for induction into the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame. The biography of Messmer at the Wisconsin Walk of Fame notes that, in addition to being captain of the football and swim teams, Messmer won three letters in each of track, football and baseball and concludes: \\"John Messmer might have been the most versatile athlete to ever compete at the University of Wisconsin.\\" He was also inducted into the University of Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1993.

It was published by Taiyoh Tosho in Japanese, and was published in English by Digital Manga Publishing in May 2008. Plot The bored young English Lord Edward discovers that unless he is wed by his 26th birthday, the family fortune will pass to another. He had previously given away his family ring, which is traditionally worn by the heir's fianc√©e, two years earlier to a prostitute named Brenda, and resolves to find the woman and hope that she will enter into a sham marriage with him. Satsuki, a Japanese exchange student studying drama, is struggling to make ends meet and works in a pub visited by Brenda, who has become gravely ill. Before she dies, he gives Satsuki a ring, asking him to return it to its rightful owner. Edward and Satsuki meet at the pub where Satsuki works, and Edward asks Satsuki to give Brenda a message. Satsuki goes to tell Brenda but finds that she had died several days earlier. As Brenda is dead, Satsuki later visits Edward at his apartment to deliver the news and return the ring. When he does this, a drunk Edward offers Satsuki ¬£300 per day to pretend to be his fianc√©e. Satsuki at first refuses but later takes him up on his offer as he needs money to stay in school. While pretending to be Edward's fianc√©e, Satsuki comes up against Edward's cousin Angelica, who wants to marry Edward and take control of the family fortune. Angelica does various things to try to ruin their engagement, such as forcing Edward to escort her instead of Satsuki to a party and then throwing wine on Satsuki's dress at the party to prevent her from dancing with Edward in public. Satsuki becomes a wallflower and ends up talking to and dancing with a foreign prince. When Edward sees this, he becomes violently jealous and leaves the party. When they return to the apartment, Edward gets drunk, and in a fit of jealous rage, rapes Satsuki. Here, it is found that Edward has fallen in love with Satsuki. However, after this, Satsuki becomes cold towards Edward, but continues their agreement to teach Edward the lesson that money cannot buy everything. Later on, Satsuki's friend Yohei from Japan visits and confesses his feelings to Satsuki, but Satsuki can only think of Edward. Satsuki realizes that he is in love with Edward. However, after Angelica again tries to ruin the engagement by making Edward believe that Satsuki is cheating on him with Yohei, Edward quits speaking to Satsuki. Due to Angelica's interferences, they decide to move the fake wedding up a month and so Satsuki and Edward marry. Afterward, Satsuki confesses to Edward that he helped Edward, not for the money but because he loves Edward. Edward returns his feelings and the two consummate their marriage. The morning after, they leave for the airport together, and Edward resolves to live without his fortune to be with Satsuki. Reception Rachel Bentham, writing for Active Anime, found the story reminded her of historical romance fiction. Briana Lawrence, writing for Mania Entertainment, felt that the pace of the final chapter was disappointing, but enjoyed the rest of the novel, especially when Satsuki was traumatised by his rape.

Voices is a U.S. nonpartisan, national organization that advocates for the well-being of children at the federal, state and local levels of government. It addresses areas such as early childhood education, health, juvenile justice, child welfare, tax and budget decisions. It was renamed from National Association of Child Advocates in 2003. Voices for America's Children closed its doors in June 2013, although its members group continue their work at the state and local level. In 2014 these members formed a new organization, Partnership for America's Children, www.partnershipforamericaschildren.org. Voices for America‚Äôs Children Closes National Office. Youthtoday.com. History Voices for America's Children began when child advocates from the US met for the first time in 1981 and formed the National Association of State-based Child Advocacy Organization (ACA) in 1984. In 2003, ACA changed its name to Voices for America's Children. In 1996 the National Association of Child Advocates established its annual Florette Angel Memorial Child Advocacy Award in memory of Florette Angel and her efforts to improve the lives of West Virginia children. In 2004, the organization prepared and published a report named ‚ÄúEarly Learning Left Out: An Examination of Public Investments in Education and Development by Child Age\\". The report was based on a comprehensive analysis of public investments in education and child development. It covered three age groups - early years (0-5), school age (6-18) and college age (19-23) - across 12 states. The report was updated the following year and then again in 2010. Voices for America's Children received two grants from Atlantic Philanthropies, a $1.8 million grant in 2006 and a $3 million three-year-grant in 2008. In 2011, after reviewing ten Republican candidates' debates and campaign websites, Voices found that only 2.2% of the debates referenced children-related issues. In 2012 Voices sent letters to Democratic candidate President Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney urging them to clarify their stance on child and family issues and to formally seek the advice of child advocates. In 2013 Voices was dissolved after a vote by the Board of Trustees. In September of the same year President Obama appointed William Bentley, former CEO of Voices, to head Family and Youth Services Bureau.

Inscriptions found at Kudimiyanmalai and Cheranur give graphic descriptions of the invasion and the sacking of Madurai. Kulasekaran and his younger brothers fled Madurai to the Palai (desert wastes) lands. The invaders looted Madurai and distributed the wealth to the destitute.

It operates a regulated electric utility company, Cleco Power, that serves approximately 290,000 retail customers in Louisiana. Cleco also operates an unregulated wholesale electricity business, Cleco Midstream, with approximately 775 megawatts of generating capacity.  History  Cleco's roots go back to the 1906 installation of a 25 kWh Corliss steam-driven generating plant in Bunkie, Louisiana. In 1914, a 50 kWh diesel engine was added to the plant to produce ice and light; and in 1935, the Bunkie plant, called Louisiana Ice & Utilities, reorganized into Louisiana Ice & Electric Company. Because ice was necessary long before electricity, ice manufacturing fostered the early development of the South's electric industry. Small steam or internal combustion electric motors powered the machinery that ran ice plants. Ice companies used power to light the plants and distributed excess energy to nearby homes and businesses. As demand increased, more facilities were needed to supply electricity and, eventually; manufacturing and delivering electricity became more important than making ice. In 1945, the company changed its name to Central Louisiana Electric Company, Inc. (CLECO), and in 1998, to Cleco Corp. (Cleco). On March 28, 2016, the Louisiana Public Service Commission in a 4-1 vote approved the sale of Cleco for $4.9 billion to a foreign purchasing group led by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets, British Columbia Investment Management Corporation, John Hancock Financial, and other infrastructure investors.Louisiana Regulators Approve Cleco Corporation Sale Associated Press, March 29, 2016.

Construction The facility was built and operated by the California State Fish & Game Commission, now known as the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Starting in 1915, the citizens of Independence began a local fundraising drive to purchase a site for a proposed state fish hatchery. $1,500.00 was raised, and an ideal site was purchased on Oak Creek, just north of the town. Fish and Game Commissioner M. J. Connell instructed the design team led by Charles Dean of the State Department of Engineering \\"to design a building that would match the mountains, would last forever, and would be a showplace for all time.\\" The architectural style they chose is Tudor Revival. Construction began in March, 1916, with a final budget of approximately $60,000.00. The walls of the building are constructed using of native granite collected within a quarter mile (400 m) of the site. The walls are two to three feet (600 to 900 mm) thick. The roof is red Spanish tile made in Lincoln, California. Operation A golden trout, California's state fish, caught in the John Muir Wilderness When construction was completed in 1917, it was the largest and best equipped hatchery in California and could produce 2,000,000 fish fry per year. Initially, fish eggs were collected from the Rae Lakes and were transported to the hatchery by mule train. Since 1918, golden trout eggs have been collected from the Cottonwood Lakes. This program is the sole source of California golden trout eggs, currently operated by the nearby Black Rock Fish Hatchery since the closure of Mt Whitney Hatchery in 2008. In July 1931, the Mount Whitney Fish Hatchery and the Colorado Fish Commission traded 30,000 Colorado River cutthroat trout eggs for 25,000 golden trout eggs. The resulting Colorado cutthroat fry were planted in remote High Sierra lakes at very high elevations. Over the following 50 years, the population in Colorado became endangered due to habitat destruction and interbreeding with other species of trout. The cutthroats now living in California remained pure. In 1987, California and Colorado cooperated to transplant 50 genetically pure cutthroats back to a remote lake in Rocky Mountain National Park, where they thrived. Proposed closure In 1996, the California Department of Fish and Game proposed closing the hatchery due to budget cuts. Local and statewide opposition to the closure developed, and instead, a plan was approved to save the facility in order to \\"provide the public with an interpretation of the historical significance of the hatchery, knowledge of the hatchery's function and an understanding of our natural resources\\". Legislation was passed designating the \\"Friends of the Mt. Whitney Fish Hatchery\\" as a private group authorized to lease part of the hatchery in order to maintain and preserve it, in coordination with the State Office of Historic Preservation. Wildfire and mudslide On July 5, 2007, a wildfire burned upstream to the west of the Mount Whitney Fish Hatchery. As a result, a year later, on July 12, 2008, a heavy thunderstorm caused a massive mudslide in the fire-scarred Oak Creek watershed that swept downstream, severely damaging the ponds and water supplies of the hatchery, as well as two employee housing units. The main building escaped major damage. The Friends of the Mt. Whitney Fish Hatchery organized restoration work that allowed the interpretive center and display pond to re-open on May 30, 2009. However, the future of full-scale hatchery production is uncertain. The first group of fish to come out of the hatchery in three years were planted in Diaz Lake, and a Kids Fishing Day was held in May, 2010.

Development In 1926, the design bureau (later OKMO) –ö–ë Orudiyno-Arsenalny Trest (OAT) began work on a \\"Liliput\\" single man light reconnaissance tank. The development team faced several problems, including finding a new chassis and engine. The project was stalled continuously. On March 3, 1928, under the leadership of the head motor lab, AP Kushka involving LY Lalmena, as well as engineers, S. Ginzburg and E. Grote undertook the production of a new draft. As part of a three-year plan to produce a force structure capable of conducting operational maneuver and infantry support, a mechanized and armored force was to be established by December 1930. In 1929 Field Regulation (Polevoi Ustay), declared that future war would be one of maneuver, developing the theory of successive operations by injecting the idea of motorization and mechanization into concepts for future offensive operations. The Ustay enunciated the aim of conducting deep battle to achieve success in penetrating the tactical depth of enemy defenses. In May 1930 the Soviets created their first mechanized support brigade, consisting of 60 tanks and 32 tankettes (tankettes were light tanks armed with heavy machine guns). Chassis and powertrain The T-17 developers utilized the T-16 chassis and powertrain for the base model. The hull was based on the \\"Liliput\\". The power unit used was a 16 hp two-cylinder air-cooled engine. The chain track was made out of rubber and steel. Superstructure and armaments The superstructure, which sat atop the chassis of the T-17 (often referred to as, like its predecessor, \\"Liliput\\"), was riveted to the frame. The driver, located in the hull, also operated a machine gun mounted to the right of the longitudinal axis. Testing With long initial delays, a prototype was ready by the end of 1929. Despite problems, it was tested in January 1930. In June of that year, another test was conducted and showed better mobility than the T-18. Modifications One of the biggest drawbacks in tanks of this era was track failure. Therefore, one of the three tankettes ordered by the summer of 1930, was tested in a different track configuration. This second version of the T-17 had rubber tracks of the K√©gresse type. However, the design was considered impractical, and it was decided to continue work on the full metal track versions, continued with the later production units of the T-18.

Bad Machinery started on 21 September 2009 loosely based on characters and situations from John Allison's previous webcomic, Scary Go Round. New full colour paneled pages appeared four times a week. The story of Bad Machinery picks up three years after the end of Scary Go Round and involves two groups of schoolchildren that investigate mysteries. History After the announcement of the end of Scary Go Round, John Allison answered readers' questions about the \\"new comic\\" in his blog, posted on 2009-09-13. He gave several hints as to the content of the new comic, indicating a preference to move away from writing about the lives of twenty-somethings, and the dispensing of many characters from Scary Go Round. In another post, the title of the new comic was revealed to be Bad Machinery, and each story (with the exception of the preamble) would be 100 pages long. The comic is named after a song by indie band Let's Active. On 21 September 2009, after a one-week hiatus following the end of Scary Go Round, Bad Machinery was launched on the same web site that had previously hosted Scary Go Round, titled Scary Go Round Presents Bad Machinery. On 21 May 2012 Oni Press announced that it would be publishing collections of the Bad Machinery storylines, and the first full-colour paperback, The Case of the Team Spirit, was released in March 2013. Content In Bad Machinery, two groups of child investigators attend the fictional Griswalds Grammar School in Keane End, Tackleford. The groups interact and compete to solve the mysteries, keeping a tally on a wall. They are not always aware that they are both working on the same mystery or dilemma, as they start with different leads. Bad Machinery focuses on humour, with funny and surreal situations, punctuated by moments of action and mystery. Every episode is comedic, and the artist will frequently add visual jokes in the background. Bad Machinery is also proudly British in its sensibilities. Publications  * * Reception Describing Bad Machinery as her favorite webcomic of 2011, Lauren Davis of Comics Alliance praised Bad Machinery for its absurd scenarios, and both she and Hannah Shannon of Bleeding Cool praised the webcomic's humorous dialogues. Shannon stated that the \\"eye candy art\\" of Bad Machinery is her favorite part of the webcomic, pointing out that the large page lay-out of the books presents all the details well. Staff of The A.V. Club noted that Bad Machinery had difficulty finding its footing when it first started. Allison's attempt to differentiate Bad Machinery from Scary Go Round despite the overlap in cast resulted in a \\"bone dry\\" execution. As Allison got a feel for his new, younger cast, \\"the stories became looser and richer.\\" The A.V.

Although often overshadowed in modern historiography by her better-known parents, she is now known to have played an important part in her family's struggles against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd and to have helped to secure the frontline at Shropshire in the run-up to English conquest of Wales. She was the wife and widow of John III FitzAlan, baron of Clun and Oswestry and de jure earl of Arundel. After a lengthy widowhood, she married for a second time and largely disappeared from the records. Family Isabella was born some time after 1247, possibly at Wigmore Castle, Herefordshire, the daughter of Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Mortimer and Maud de Braose. Her father was a celebrated soldier and Marcher baron; and her mother was a staunch royalist during the Second Barons' War who devised the plan for the escape of Prince Edward, the future King Edward I of England, from the custody of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester. She had one sister and five brothers, including Ralph, would-be heir to the family estates, who predeceased his parents, and Edmund Mortimer, 2nd Baron Mortimer. Marriages and issue Before 14 May 1260, Isabella married her first husband, John III FitzAlan, the son and heir of John II FitzAlan, baron of Clun and Oswestry and de jure earl of Arundel, and Maud de Verdun. In due course John the younger would succeed to the baronies of Clun and Oswestry, but as long as the dowager countess of Arundel remained alive the FitzAlans did not possess the complete earldom or its title. Consequently, Isabella Mortimer never held the title of countess of Arundel, which remained until 1282 with Isabella de Warenne, the childless widow of Hugh d'Aubigny (d.1243). Together Isabella Mortimer and John III FitzAlan had at least two children: * Richard Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel (3 February 1267- 9 March 1302), married Alice of Saluzzo, by whom he had issue. * Maud Fitzalan (died after October 1298), married Sir Philip Burnell of Condover, Holgate, Acton Burnell, and Little Rissington, by whom she had issue. Isabella's husband died, aged around 25, in the spring of 1272, leaving underage children. The couple's son Richard FitzAlan was a boy of about five at the time of his father's death and was committed to the wardship of his maternal grandfather, Roger Mortimer of Wigmore. Serious errors in our nineteenth-century sources have led to the enduring misconception that Isabella Mortimer married Ralph d' Ardern soon after the death of John FitzAlan and had three husbands in all. In fact, she remained a widow for over twelve years and was a prominent and active contributor to Marcher society during that time. On 2 September 1285, in a private ceremony at Poling, Sussex, she married, as his second wife, Robert de Hastang. She was initially heavily penalized for having married without royal licence, before it was discovered that her late father had purchased her marriage rights many years earlier from King Henry III, and that she and her new husband had absolved themselves of any wrongdoing under the terms of this agreement, by paying a fine to the executors of father's will.Calendar of Close Rolls,1279-88, p. 451 She does not appear to have had any children from her second marriage.  Widowhood and the Welsh Frontier  It was during her protracted widowhood that Isabella Mortimer's contributions to Marcher society and Anglo-Welsh relations became clear. With dower and other rights, including royal appointments, in several border strongholds, she developed something of a working partnership alongside her father. Together they were responsible for the security of much of the frontier from the lower edge of Cheshire to southern Herefordshire. Among other things, Isabella was charged with victualing Oswestry Castle for the incoming garrison at the start of the Anglo-Welsh war of 1282 and, several years earlier, with overseeing much needed repairs to the same castle. In late 1282, as a second war with Llywelyn ap Gruffudd got under way, Isabella was replaced by her younger brother Edmund in most of her custodial interests, including the frontier fortresses. Although their father was as yet still alive, Edmund was now emerging as the new head of the Mortimer family of Wigmore and the natural leader of the family's war effort. Isabella died before 1 April 1292, on which date her husband was released by the Crown from paying outstanding sums relating to her own economic activities. She is buried with her son in the church at Haughmond Abbey.

Origins The origins of Fraternit√© Notre- Dame are in the reported apparitions of the Virgin Mary in Fr√©chou, France. They were received in 1977 by Jean Marie Kozik, a Frenchman of Polish origin, who was consecrated as a bishop in 1978 by the dissident and excommunicated Vietnamese Archbishop Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ª•c. Rite The general religious practices of followers of Fraternit√© Notre-Dame are in line with other Traditionalist Catholics, who prefer the pre-Vatican II Church, especially the Tridentine Mass in Latin as opposed to the post-Vatican II Mass in vernacular languages. Today Fraternit√© Notre-Dame operates religious and humanitarian missions on four continents. The order operates soup kitchens and weekly food pantries in Paris, New York City, Ulan Bator, Chicago, and San Francisco. Additionally, a hospital for the poor has been opened in Mongolia, and it has also operated humanitarian convoys to benefit those victimized by war in Croatia, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Rwanda. The Fraternit√© opened a new mission in Detroit during the summer of 2018. The mission is in what was Most Holy Name of Jesus parish until 1990, and most recently Shield of Faith Ministries. Chicago In 2000, the movement opened its Mother House for North America in Chicago's Austin neighborhood in the former Gammon United Methodist Church, a structure built by noted Cleveland architect Sidney Badgley and featured in a number of books on Chicago architecture, notably The AIA Guide to Chicago by Alice Sinkevitch (Harvest Books 2004). Fraternit√© Notre-Dame uses the complex as a Novitiate/Seminary for religious friars and future priests, as well as a Novitiate for religious nuns out of the complex. Since then Fraternit√© Notre- Dame nuns have become a fixture at numerous Chicago area farmer's markets selling traditional French pastries to raise funds for the group.

Traditionally, the sweet was offered in a jesa (ancestral rite) and enjoyed on festive days such as chuseok (harvest festival), marriages, or hwangap (sixtieth-birthday) celebrations. In modern South Korea, it is also served as a dessert and can be bought at traditional markets or supermarkets.  Etymology  Yakgwa (; ), consisting of two syllables, yak (; ; \\"medicine\\") and gwa (; ; \\"confection\\"), means \\"medicinal confection\\". This name comes from the large amount of honey that is used to prepare it, because pre-modern Koreans considered honey to be medicinal and so named many honey-based foods yak (\\"medicine\\"). \\"Honey cookie\\" is a common English translation for this confection's name.  History  Yakgwa is a food with a long history. It was made for Buddhist rites during the Later Silla era (668‚Äì935). During the Goryeo era (918‚Äì1392), yakgwa was used for pyebaek (a formal greeting) in the wedding ceremony of Goryeo kings and Yuan princesses. Yakgwa was originally made in the shape of birds and animals, but it became flatter for ease of stacking during the Joseon era (1392‚Äì1897). Each pattern signifies a wish; butterflies represent a happy marriage, bats bring fortune, and pine trees symbolize the beginning of a new year. One would print a lotus for harmony and a pomegranate for fertility. Then, in the Joseon Kingdom, it was simplified into a sphere. However, the balls were not suitable for presenting at the table for ancestral rites. So it transformed into a cube. Eventually, the yakgwa was stylized to take its current shape, round with a rippled edge. In pre-modern Korea, yakgwa was mostly enjoyed by the upper classes, as wheat was a rare and cherished ingredient, and honey was also regarded highly. Today yakgwa is common to serve with tea, but can also be gifts for special occasions.  Preparation and varieties  The dough is made by kneading sifted wheat flour with sesame oil, honey, ginger juice, and cheongju (rice wine). Flours and sesame oil (are rubbed together with hands, and then passed through a mesh sieve. Sugar syrup in soju are added to the resulting flour and sesame oil mixture, which is then kneaded, sheeted, and cut into squares. Sugar syrup is prepared by boiling mixture of sugar and water for 10 min and then starch syrup is added. Yakgwa gets its shape by being pressed into flower-shaped wooden molds called yakgwa-pan (), or flattened with a mallet and cut into squares. Depending on the size, yakgwa is classified into dae-yakgwa (large), jung-yakgwa (medium), and so-yakgwa (small). The ones cut into squares or rectangles are called mo-yakgwa (angular yakgwa). Shaped pieces are then slowly deep-fried at a relatively low temperature, around . The deep-fried cookies are then soaked in honey, mixed with cinnamon powder, and dried, which gives the yakgwa a sweet taste and a soft, moist texture. The treat may also be sprinkled with various topping such as pine nuts or sesame seeds.  Research and further developments  A report released the food science and biotechnology department in Inha University, South Korea researched effects of Jupcheong (soaking syrup) with and without ginger powder in the yakgwa recipe and then letting it store for a few weeks. The dough pieces were deep fried in soy bean oil at 90 to 150 degrees c, soaked in syrup with and without ginger powder, and lastly stored at 30 degrees c in the dark for 8 weeks. It was found that jupcheong especially with ginger could improve the lipid oxidative stability of yakgwa by higher protection of tocopherols and lignans than polyphenols from degradation, and tocopherols were the most important antioxidants in reducing lipid oxidation of yakgwa. With the use of ginger powder instead of the traditional ginger juice used in the recipe, the powder helps support the lipid oxidative in yakgwa. The lipid oxidative in yakwa deteriorates fat and has other health benefits. Additionally, in 2014 the Dong Eui University academic cooperation foundation and Sancheon Korea medicine yakchs patent application for health functional yakgwa. The Korean intellectual released the following abstract, ‚ÄúThe present invention relates to a health functional fried honey cake usingmedicinal plants and a method for manufacturing the same. The health functional fried honey cake according to the present invention is manufactured by being baked in an oven instead of a traditional way using Eucommia, monarchy, Angelica, mulberry leaves, or tea powder, thereby reducing more calories and fat than when fried honey cake is manufactured by the traditional way and improving antioxidant functions, flavor, and health.‚Äù  See also  * List of Korean desserts *  References  Category:Korean desserts Category:Hangwa ","title":"Yakgwa"},{"id":"25018646","text":"Hejiang may refer to: * Hejiang Province, a former province in Northeast China * Hejiang County, in Sichuan, China * Hejiang Subdistrict (ÂêàÊ±üË°óÈÅì), a subdistrict of Shigu District, Hengyang, Hunan.

While he began writing it immediately after finishing Where Have All the Bullets Gone? in 1985, he finished it in a manic two week period in early 1986Spike: An Intimate Memoir, by Norma Farnes. Harper Collins UK, 2011. World War II has ended, Milligan continues NAAFI performances. During this time in Italy and Austria he tours with a large group as one of The Bill Hall Trio. While music and war were backdrops for the first books, music and his relationship with Toni Fontana are here. (A relationship described in longings using tourist- guide Italian, and a repetitive fascination with being called ‚ÄúTerr-ee‚Äù.) The book covers June to September 1946, at which point Milligan is released from service and sails home for England. The text is a fifth shorter than the longest volume Mussolini: His Part in My Downfall. The jokes are sometimes sparse. Unlike the people he occasionally performed with during the war, with whom Milligan later worked or who otherwise became notable, Milligan spends a page suggesting the NAAFI tour group were ‚Äúbloody awful‚Äù, and that ‚Äú...none of them were ever heard of again‚Äù. (p. 111) But he says of Bill Hall: :‚ÄùGod, what a strange man, but a genius of a musician. When he died a few years ago, I realized that a genius could die unsung.‚Äù (p. 37) Italian ballerina Toni Fontana, a member of the group, is Milligan‚Äôs almost exclusive love interest. Milligan‚Äôs Italian is weak, her English is better, but not always up to Milligan‚Äôs verbal horseplay. Jokes need to be explained. Beyond reflections on how wonderful Milligan is, that it‚Äôs too hot, or too crowded, her opinions are little described ‚Äî she says that Mussolini ‚Äúwas not a bad man, just stupid‚Äù. :‚ÄùWere we sure we were in love? The answer seemed to be yes. So, what do we do? Do we get engaged? I think if I had asked her, she would have said yes.‚Äù (p. 109) (Milligan ‚Äú...frequently said she was the love of his life. And they used to meet in Paris right up to the time he became too frail to travel.‚ÄùNorma Farnes, Editor, The Compulsive Spike Milligan, Fourth Estate, London, 2004.) When not with Toni, Milligan plays or listens to music, or reads. ‚Äú‚Ä¶we retire to my room for two hours and play those jazz standards I still love, ‚ÄòGeorgia Brown‚Äô, ‚ÄòPoor Butterfly‚Äô, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs New‚Äô, ‚ÄòSophisticated Lady‚Äô‚Äù (p. 30). There is music on the long bus trips between gigs. :‚ÄùHall produces his violin and plays Italian melodies. The Italians join in. I know this all may sound repetitive, but that‚Äôs how it was. We were all very repetitive.‚Äù (p. 161) Milligan amplifies on a theme from \\"Rommel?\\" \\"Gunner Who?\\" ‚Äî the effect of popular culture on his life expectations: :‚ÄùFor me, the real world didn‚Äôt exist, so I grew up emotionally deformed....I was still wrapped up in the aura of the last film I had seen....The tram, the fog-ridden cold morning outside were all imaginary. They would all disappear when I saw my next Bing Crosby film. Most of my middle life would be spent trying to escape from their cloying influence....It wasn‚Äôt until I saw The Grapes of Wrath that I saw a real film.‚Äù (p. 189) As with earlier volumes, it is not always clear what is contrived. Illustratively, Milligan quotes two diary sentences, then expands them into a page of description (pp. 268-9). Other inserts are definitely contrived, such as quoting Hitler, ‚Äú'You see, you Russian fools? Zey are already starting to like back us Germans!'‚Äù (p. 100).

A group of guests are holding a large party. During the festivity Counciler of Justice Knap argues that the Middle Ages were a time better than their own, more specifically the time of King Hans. Suddenly two fairies arrive, dressed up as house maids. One is old, Dame Care, the other is a minion of Dame Fortune. The dame has brought a pair of galoshes along that can transport whoever wears them to whatever time, place or condition in life that he desires. And his every wish in regard to time and place will be instantly granted. Dame Care predicts that it will nevertheless make the person unhappy, wishing he was back in the present. As the party concludes Councilor Knap decides to go home. He finds the galoshes, puts them on and is sent back to the reign of King Hans. He is not immediately aware of what happened, but does notice that the unpaved streets are full with filth and mud. He notices a procession for the Bishop of Seeland and assumes it's for the bishop from his time period. As he wants to cross the bridge to Palace Square he notices it's gone and ask two men in a boat where the bridge is and that he wants to go to Christian's Harbour on Little Market Street. The men have no idea what he is talking about and Knap has trouble understanding their speech, which he assumes is an accent that belongs to people of Bornholm. As a result, he continues his walk, frustrated that not only the bridge is gone and all the lights are out, but that there are also no cabs to take. He decides to walk back to the East Street, but to his amazement the East Gate is now a meadow. Knap assumes he must be ill and desperately wants to go home, but he can't recognize any of the buildings. As he enters a tavern he tries to find his local paper, but they don't have it. When he notices a woodcut of a meteor over Cologne he wonders where the owners \\"got this rare old print?\\". As he discusses the content he gets into a conversation in Latin with a man who holds a bachelor in theology. They discuss many topics and Knap keeps misinterpreting these medieval topics for events that happened in his own lifetime. For instance, he confuses a remark about the Black Plague with a reference to a cholera epidemic in the 19th century. As the evening continues they all begin to drink more and Knap is repulsed by the vulgar behaviour of the people. He decides to sneak out, but the others pull him back from under the table by his feet, thereby pulling off the galoshes and breaking the spell. Waking up in his own age Knapp assumes it was all a dream and now fancies his own time period as the best. Next, a watchman tries the galoshes on. He wishes to be the lieutenant, because he assumes his life is much better than his. The galoshes do their work and suddenly the watchmen becomes the lieutenant, sitting at his desk. He notices the lieutenant had written a poem called, \\"If Only I Were Rich\\", which confesses that the lieutenant actually feels he is short on money and is lonely as a result. Then he realizes he would rather be a watchman, because he at least has a wife and children who share his joy and sorrows. The galoshes then transform him back into himself. The watchman, still unaware what has happened, watches a falling star. He wishes he could travel to the Moon and suddenly the galoshes send him there at the speed of light. There he meets several Moon men who all wonder whether Earth is inhabited and decide this must be impossible. Back on Earth the lifeless body of the watchman is found and he is brought to a hospital, where they take his shoes off, breaking the spell again. He awakens and declares it to have been the most terrible night he had ever experienced. As the galoshes remain in the hospital one of the young night internes tries them on. His task is to guard the hospital fence, but he wishes to get out for a while, wondering whether he \\"could get his head through the fence and escape.\\" As soon as he thinks this his head is stuck and he's unable to pull it back. He struggles for a while, until he wishes he was free again, which is granted by the galoshes. The next day the intern attends a theatrical play called My Grandmother's Spectacles in Kannike Street. The spectacles in the play are able to let anyone who wears them read the future from people's faces. The internee wishes he had such a pair of glasses and soon enough he has them. As he witnesses into the spectators' on the front row's hearts he notices all kinds of bizarre views. He concludes he must have had too much blood rushing to his head and wishes he could take a Russian steam bath. Suddenly he is indeed there, but fully clothed and scaring off the other people in the room. He has enough sense to pull himself together and tell everybody it's part of a bet. He then returns home and the next day he has a blistered back. Meanwhile, the watchman picks up the galoshes at the hospital and turns them in at the police station where they are accidentally given to a clerk whose galoshes happened to have been lost too. During a walk the clerk meets a friend who is a poet and desires to live his life, for it seems to be much more enjoyable than his. At first the clerk enjoys being a poet full of inspiration. Then he wishes he was a lark, but is caught by a little boy and sold off to a family, where he is put inside a cage. He talks with a canary and parrot, who both lament the days when they were still free. As it so happens the cage door is open and the clerk tries to fly away, but is attacked by a cat. He manages to fly back to his own home, where the spell is broken again. Then the fairy tale concludes with the clerk's neighbour, a theological student, asking for the galoshes. The clerk gives them to him. As the student walks away he wishes he could travel to Switzerland and Italy, whereupon he is on top of the Mont Blanc. In the freezing weather he wishes he was on the other side of the Alps, where he ends up in Italy, near Lake Thrasymene. There he enjoys the beautiful landscapes, but he is confronted with the local people's hunger and poverty. He concludes that it would be better off if his body could rest, while the spirit flies on without it. The galoshes grant his wish and he is now peacefully dead. Andersen concludes with a quote by Solon: \\"Call no man happy until he rests in his grave.\\" Dame Care then tells the other fairy that her predictions have indeed all came true. Though she does grant the student a favor. She takes off his galoshes and takes them back with her, causing him to be brought back to life.

This founding document of the Mexican nation was drafted in the National Palace in Mexico City on September 28, 1821, by Juan Jos√© Espinosa de los Monteros, secretary of the Provisional Governmental Board. Three copies of the act were executed. One was destroyed in a fire in 1909. The other two copies are in the Museo Historico de Acapulco Fuerte de San Diego in Acapulco and in the General Archive of the Nation in Mexico City. The document is wide and high. Background Trigarante Army to M√©xico City. On September 27, 1821, eleven years and eleven days after the Grito de Dolores, the Army of the Three Guarantees headed by Agust√≠n de Iturbide entered Mexico City, concluding the Mexican War of Independence. On September 28, Iturbide installed the Provisional Governing Board, comprising 38 people. The board was chaired by Antonio P√©rez Mart√≠nez y Robles, and Juan Jos√© Espinosa de los Monteros was secretary. The board immediately elected the five members of the Regency of the Empire. On October 13 of the same year, Ram√≥n Guti√©rrez del Mazo, the first political chief of Mexico City, distributed a proclamation with the Declaration of Independence so all the people could read it, especially the courts, governors and military authorities, for them to publish it nationwide. Drafting and signing On the afternoon of September 28, members of the Board met at the National Palace to draft the Declaration of Independence of the newly independent nation. The resulting two documents were drafted in its final form by Juan Jos√© Espinosa de los Monteros, Secretary of the Board. The acts were signed by 33 of the 38 members of the Board and Iturbide as President of the Regency of the Empire. Juan O'Donoj√∫, last Superior Political Chief of New Spain, Francisco Severo Maldonado, Jos√© Domingo Rus, Jos√© Mariano de Almanza and Miguel S√°nchez Enciso did not sign the documents, but in the acts was written: Place of signature Juan O'Donoju and later his signature was added in the printed copies. The signatures of other four members were not added. Juan Jose Espinosa de los Monteros signed twice in each act, once as a member of the Board and the second as secretary, so that the acts contain 35 signatures and the designated to O'Donoj√∫. A copy of the act was for the government and one for the board, the last one was later sent to the Chamber of Deputies. None of the former insurgents‚Äîsuch as Guadalupe Victoria, Vicente Guerrero or Nicol√°s Bravo‚Äîsigned the Declaration of Independence; the reason is unknown but probably because they wanted a Republic not an Empire. Text Entrance of the Trigarante Army by La Garita de Bel√©n to Mexico City. Signatories The following is the list of the people who signed the Declaration of Independence, the names are written like in the acts. Juan O'Donoju did not sign but his name was written in the acts. Of the 38 members of the Provisional Governmental Board only 34 signed the document (including the aforementioned firm O'Donoju).

Provisional Governmental Board ‚Äì first original declaration One copy was given to the Provisional Governmental Board, which was later put on display in the Chamber of Deputies until 1909, when fire destroyed the location. Bravo/Ruiz de Velasco ‚Äì second original declaration The Ruiz de Velasco family were the original owners for 128 years of the Acta de Independencia del Imperio Mexicano de 1821. This document was passed down through generations from Nicol√°s Bravo. On August 22, 1987, Pedro Ruiz de Velasco de la Madrid gave the document as a gift to Mexico. Jos√© Francisco Ruiz Massieu, Governor of Guerrero, accepted this gift and secured this historical document in the Museo Historico de Acapulco Fuerte de San Diego in Acapulco in the State of Guerrero. Regency of the Empire ‚Äì third original declaration A third copy was given to the Regency of the Empire, which remained at the National Palace and was stolen in 1830. Foreign Minister Lucas Alam√°n made this reference about the stolen: Alam√°n wanted to get the record during his tenure as foreign minister but failed even when he offered a lot of money for it. Decades later, the act was acquired by Emperor Maximilian I, although it is unknown how and where he got it. The act contains in the back the figure of the ex libris of Maximilian's library. After Maximilian's execution, Agustin Fischer, confessor of the emperor, took the document out of the country. Some time later, the act appeared in Spain in the library of antiquarian Gabriel S√°nchez. It is also unknown how he got it, but is a fact that the act has in the back the stamp of the Spanish antiquarian library. S√°nchez sold the document to the Mexican historian Joaqu√≠n Garc√≠a Icazbalceta, who preserved it and passed it down to his son Luis Garc√≠a Pimentel. Florencio Gavito Bustillo lived in France and there he was contacted by Luis Garc√≠a Pimentel, who offered to sell him the Declaration of Independence. After buying the act for 10 thousand pesos he returned to Mexico with the intention of delivering the act to the Mexican government himself, but he died of leukemia in 1958. Gavito expressed in his will the wish that the act should be delivered to the president. The Mexican government sent the document for opinions of authenticity. The opinions were ready on November 14, 1961. The ceremony to deliver the act was held on November 21 of the same year. Florencio Gavito Jauregui, son of Gavito Bustillo gave the act to the president Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos. In the ceremony were also Gustavo D√≠az Ordaz, Secretary of the Interior and Jaime Torres Bodet, Secretary of Education. The act was put on display for a while in Chapultepec Castle and then it was withdrawn and sent to the General Archive of the Nation. In 2008, the restoration works on the act began and it was exhibited for a month at the Palace of Lecumberri. In 2010 it was put on display at the National Palace as part of the celebration of the bicentennial of the beginning of Mexico's independence. The National Institute of Anthropology and History was concerned about the exposure of the act and recommended not to expose it to more time because it does not have a special system for that. The act is protected between two flyleaves made with acid-free materials in the vault of the General Archive of the Nation under climate monitoring. Experts of the National Autonomous University of Mexico are working on a system of preservation and exhibition of historical documents in order to permanently exhibit the act in the near future.

The company logo is a turtle with its shell in the shape of a padlock with a mesh cage pattern. History Outpac Designs Limited, makers of Pacsafe, was established in 1998 in Hong Kong by two Australians. Their inspiration behind the original Pacsafe product and travel security products came while travelling in South America, where they saw chicken wire put around bags to protect it against theft. Shortly afterwards, they created the slashproof wire cage system Exomesh, the Pacsafe 85L, big enough to enclose an 85-litre backpack, later adding other sizes. In 2005, Pacsafe locks were made compatible with the Travel Sentry standard used by many international airport security authorities. In 2006, the Citysafe series was added to enhance the women‚Äôs travel bag lineup. By 2012, Pacsafe had expanded their range to include adventure backpacks, urban and leisure bags, women‚Äôs bags, photography bags, luggage and travel accessories that all incorporate anti-theft features.

The regime lasted for only 13 years and had only one king. Founding Since the 1340s, the Mongol-ruled Yuan dynasty began to face numerous crises. The Yellow River flooded constantly, and other natural disasters also occurred. At the same time, the Yuan dynasty required considerable military expenditure to maintain its vast empire. This was solved mostly through additional taxation that fell mainly on the Han Chinese population which constituted the lowest two castes in the four castes of the Yuan dynasty. From this chaos, leaders arose from many places throughout the empire. Zhang Shicheng, who was a salt shipper from Jiangsu province rebelled against the Yuan dynasty in 1353. Zhang with his brother soon conquered Taizhou, Xinghua and Gaoyou in 1353. In 1354 Zhang established Great Zhou and declared himself as king with the era name Tianyou (Â§©‰Ωë). Soon afterward, on the same year Zhang controlled Yangzhou, an important center of salt trade on the Grand Canal, just north of the Yangtze. In 1356 Zhang seized Suzhou, the main hub of transportation and commerce of Jiangnan (the \\"South of the Lower Yangtze\\" region), and made the city his capital. Zhang appointed his brother Zhang Shixin as prime minister and Zhang Shide as General commander. Many ethnic Han Yuan generals submitted to Zhang after he had established the Kingdom of Dazhou.  Economy & culture  cash coin issued by the Kingdom of Dazhou. Kingdom of Dazhou was one of the country's main granaries and also produced over half of all salt in China. Dazhou became the most prosperous kingdom compared to its rivals such as the Yuan, Zhu Yuanzhang and Chen Youliang. Zhang's regime was mostly patterned on the Yuan dynasty model, but made use of some of the earlier traditional Chinese terminology as well. Decline & fall By 1366, Zhu had conquered most of the various rebel kingdoms in the Yangtze region, and in December his army reached Suzhou, capturing it on October 1, 1367, after a 10-month siege.

It is the first of its kind established in China and one of the earliest in Asia. The Centre strives to stimulate critical reasoning about fundamental ethical concerns in contemporary society, to raise awareness of moral values, and to further strengthen the University's commitment to research and whole person education. To accomplish its mission, the Centre has been active in organizing various academic activities, publishing research results in different fields of Applied Ethics and developing a co-operation network with other institutions. Background The development of ethical centre is urgently needed in Hong Kong as it is undergoing unprecedented rapid economic and socio-cultural changes, bringing ethical tension and disorientation. And although similar centres abound in Europe and North America, the results of their research are not always immediately useful to Asian societies in general and Hong Kong in particular. At the same time social-ethical issues relevant to them are not always identical to those in Hong Kong's situation. The centre, while seeking to formulate ethical solutions on the basis of universal principles, aims to be culturally sensitive in its endeavors. Objectives *The Centre is committed to research which covers the whole range of applied ethics. It is particularly concerned with different areas which are of high importance to our society. *The Centre will take keen interest in avoiding any sort of ivory-tower mentality and make sure that its efforts benefit society and public at large. This will be achieved particular by organizing symposia, conferences and individual lectures open to the public and publishing research papers and articles in academic journals and taking up ethical topics in newspapers.

Future applications of epsychology interventions are likely to become increasingly more common in information, organization, and management sciences (e.g. organizational change, conflict management and negotiation skills).

In general, it appears that intensive theory-based interventions that include multiple behaviour change techniques and modes of delivery (e.g. mobile phones and the Internet) are the most effective. More specifically, interventions based on the theory of planned behaviourAjzen, I. (1991). \\"The theory of planned behaviour\\". Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 179‚Äì211. and cognitive-behavioural therapy seem to provide the most promising results. These findings should, however, be interpreted with caution as many research articles fail to report the theoretical underpinnings of epsychology interventions adequately.Walters, S.T., Wright, J.A. & Shegog, R.

Thus, there is a great potential for utilizing epsychology to reach out and deliver prevention and treatment to the public by means of information technology. Information technology has a high scalability and given the usage and population statistics on, for example, Internet technology,Miniwatts Marketing Group (2009). World Internet users and population stats: Internet world stats 30 September 2009. From: http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm.

(2005). \\"Online therapy for addictive behaviours\\". CyberPsychology & Behaviour, 8, 555‚Äì561. Among the first companies to take advantage of the new technological opportunities combined with state-of-the-art psychological research were Health Media in the US (later acquired by Johnson & Johnson) and the privately held Changetech AS in Norway. Epsychology interventions are considered a supplement to existing treatments rather than a substitute, although such interventions can be used as a stand-alone treatment given that they are more cost-effective than standard treatment. Pharmaceutical companies Janssen-Cilag and Novartis were also early out with patient-support programs that came with the patients' medication. The purpose in such programs is primarily to help patients take their medication as prescribed. A lack of medical compliance is a serious health problem even among patients diagnosed with severe and potentially fatal diseases such as cancerAtkins, L. & Fallowfield, L. (2006). \\"Intentional and non-intentional non-adherence to medication amongst breast cancer patients\\". European Journal of Cancer, 42, 2271‚Äì2276. or HIV/AIDS.Stephenson, J. (1999). \\"AIDS researchers target poor adherence\\". Journal of the American Medical Association, 281, 1069. In fact, in one study about 70% of hospital visits for adverse drug reactions were caused by inadequate medical compliance.Senst, B.L., Achusim, L.E., Genest, R.P., Cosentino, L.A., Ford, C.C. et al.

Although patient-support programs may lack in theoretical orientation, it is clear that they try to help patients manage an inherent psychological problem.

Biography Zener was born in 1966 in Astoria, Oregon, to a psychologist father and a violinist mother who played for the San Francisco Symphony. He grew up in the seaside community of Encinitas, California. In 1991 he settled in San Francisco, where he was still living as of 2004. Zener has three children, the first born in approximately 1998, the second in approximately 2002, and the 3rd in 2009. He paints mostly out of a studio in Sausalito. Career Zener's works have been exhibited and sold throughout the United States, and internationally, and are part of a number of prominent private and corporate art collections. In April 2014, Zener became the second artist-in-residence of the Quin Arts Program at the Quin Hotel in New York City. His collection at the Quin included a large format oil painting and 11 resins of his most iconic pieces as well as new work from his annual solo show at Gallery Henoch in Chelsea for the Quin‚Äôs video art wall. Painting style and influences Zener is a self-taught artist. As of 2004 he had created more than 600 works. His paintings, mostly in oil, are in a photorealist or \\"super- realist\\" style Zener describes as \\"Contemporary Renaissance\\". Water paintings In 2003, while living in the Costa Brava region of Spain, Zener became interested in watching bathers, and began a series of paintings of water, and of people interacting with water. Many paintings from this period depict women swimming underwater amidst air bubbles, or diving into the water, and have been described as reminiscent of Hudson River School and Barbizon School painters. For a second, more \\"experimental\\" series of water images, Zener painted over photographic transparencies that had been mounted on a wooden box covered with silver leaf, then covered with resin. Other subjects for Zener have included beach scenes, and businessmen in various unexpected settings, such as by swimming pools or on tightropes.

After the election, the composition of the council was *Conservative 21 *Liberal Democrats 20 *Labour 15 *Independent 1 *Vacant 1 Background Before the election the Liberal Democrats were the largest party on the council with 23 councillors, compared to 19 for the Conservatives, 15 for Labour and there was 1 independent. 7 councillors stood down at the election, Liberal Democrats John Henchley, John Peters and Brian Roberts, Conservatives Richard Blossom, Patrick Johnston and Julian Turner, and Labour's David Enright. The Liberal Democrats targeted Labour held seats in Ashley and St Peter's, while Labour aimed to pick up a seat in Cunningham. As well as the 3 main political parties, voters could also vote for the No Candidate Deserves My Vote! party in some wards, which was standing in order to give voters the chance to register their abstention at the polls. Voting trial A trial took place in Sopwell and Verulam wards under which voters could vote either by internet, phone, post or at the polling station using a touch screen system. The internet voting trial was funded by the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions as part of an attempt to get more people involved in elections. As a result of the trial one of the wards set the fastest declaration time at only 4 minutes after the close of polling. However turnout was actually down from 24.1% to 23.3% in Sopwell ward and down from 41.9% to 38.9% in Verulam ward compared to the last election in 2000. Election result The Conservatives gained 3 seats from the Liberal Democrats in Colney Heath, Harpenden North and Sandridge to become the largest party on the council with 21 councillors. The Liberal Democrats dropped to 20 seats, but did gain an increased share of the votes, while Labour stayed on 15 seats. There also remained 1 independent councillor and one seat was vacant after the death of Verulam Conservative councillor Michael Pugh on 22 April 2002. Overall turnout at the election was 38.22%, up from 33.56% at the 2000 election.

Wu Ming is a collective of five authors founded in 2000. The members were formerly associated with the Luther Blissett Project and wrote the international best- selling novel Q. Manituana is the first episode of an 18th-century pan- Atlantic trilogy which the authors call \\"the Atlantic Triptych\\". All novels will be set in the 1770s, all across the Atlantic Ocean (North America, Europe, the West Indies and Africa), before and during the American Revolution. Setting and plot Manituana is set in the years 1775-1783 in New York's Mohawk Valley, Quebec and London. The novel is divided into three main sections entitled \\"Iroquireland\\", \\"Mohock Club\\" and \\"Cold Cold Heart\\". There are two brief interludes between the sections, entitled \\"The Crossing\\" and \\"The Return\\". Among the numerous real historical characters that populate the book, the most important ones are Joseph Brant, war chief of the Mohawk nation, and Molly Brant, a matron of the Wolf clan in the Iroquois Six Nations. Characters * Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet. Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the northern colonies. * Joseph Brant.

Reactions and interpretations In the springtime of 2007, Manituana reached #4 in the Italian best-seller charts.Reported on Italian daily paper La Stampa on April 7, 2007, article included by Wu Ming on their website. In the following months, it was awarded the Premio Sergio Leone 2007 and the Premio Emilio Salgari 2008. The US, UK, Spanish and French editions were all published in 2009. The novel was translated into English by Shaun Whiteside. In November 2010 the novel was nominated for the International Dublin Literary Award. In an entry on their weblog, Wu Ming wrote that \\"Manituana was written between 2003 and 2007, and it soaked up all the tensions of that period: S11, the Neoconservative hegemony on US foreign policy, the lies on Saddam allegedly keeping weapons of mass destruction hidden in the desert, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, George W.

Film critic and writer Woody Haut wrote that the novel \\"has clear parallels with the war in Iraq, and the pitting of \\"good\\" Muslims against \\"bad\\" Muslims, just as Native Americans were used during the revolutionary period, only for the colonists to exploit and devastate both groups.Woody Haut, \\"Manituana by Wu Ming\\", Woody Haut's Blog, October 30, 2009.\\" Reviewing Manituana on CounterPunch, Ron Jacobs recognized \\"a mirror of this situation in today's manipulations of the indigenous peoples in the lands the west wants as its own today: the Shia vs. Sunni conflict in Iraq and the manipulation of tribal conflicts in Afghanistan are but two examples that come immediately to mind.

Her Mongolian name was Budashiri (; ; or ).  Life  Queen Noguk was born Budashiri, a member of the Yuan dynasty's ruling Borjigin clan and a great-great-great granddaughter of Kublai Khan. Though her birth year is unknown, she is recorded as having married the reformist monarch Gongmin of Goryeo in the Yuan capital of Khanbaliq in 1349, after which she went to live in Goryeo. Queen Noguk's marriage followed a practice established by Kublai Khan, where female members of the Yuan royal clan were married to Goryeo princes in order to maintain Yuan hegemony on the peninsula. By contrast with earlier marriages between the Yuan and Gogryeo, however, Budashiri's marriage to Gongmin was described as happy. Despite the close relationship between King Gongmin and her, they were childless. Queen Noguk became pregnant fifteen years after marriage, but died in 1365 from complications related to the childbirth. After her death, King Gongmin became indifferent to politics and entrusted great tasks to a Buddhist monk, Pyeonjo, who was executed in 1371. King Gongmin was killed in his sleep by Hong Ryun (ÌôçÎ•ú), Choe Man-saeng (ÏµúÎßåÏÉù), and others in 1374.  Legacy  Jongrung, the tomb of Queen Noguk, next to the tomb of King Gongmin. King Gongmin began the construction of a tomb near Kaesong after Queen Noguk's death. The queen was interred under the mound Jongrung, and her husband was later buried under an accompanying mound known as Hyonrung. In 1367, she posthumously received the title \\"princess supreme\\" (, ) ‚Äì typically accorded to aunts of emperors (even though she was not). According to the Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty, the tenth king Yeonsan believed that Queen Noguk had looked similar to his mother, the deposed Queen Yun, so he collected Queen Noguk's portraits at government offices.

The series includes the video games Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, Uncharted: Golden Abyss, and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, as well as a motion comic prequel, Uncharted: Eye of Indra. It primarily focuses on the exploits of treasure hunter Nathan Drake and his associates as they hunt down various mystical artifacts. In Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, he must stop a group of mercenaries from collecting a cursed golden idol known as \\"El Dorado\\" and using it as a biological weapon. In Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, he races a homicidal war criminal to find the powerful and mythical Cintamani Stone in Shambhala. In Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, he competes with a secret order to search for the fabled 'Iram of the Pillars', and in the prequel comic Uncharted: Eye of Indra, he works for an Indonesian crime lord in order to get the money needed to raise the coffin of his supposed relative Sir Francis Drake. Nathan Drake is the primary playable character of the series. He has a shady past, in which he associated with a number of thieves and black market salesmen in order to obtain various valuable items. The development team sought to make him a generally average and likeable character. He is accompanied by a number of characters, the main ones being Elena Fisher and Victor \\"Sully\\" Sullivan. He has had two love interests in the series so far; the aforementioned Elena Fisher, a reporter and now his wife, and Chloe Frazer, another treasure hunter and an old flame, but was involved with Rika Raja in the motion comic. He is also accompanied by his longtime friend, associate, and mentor, Victor Sullivan. A team at Naughty Dog designed the character appearances, and Amy Hennig was the main writer of their personalities and mannerisms. The voice actors were given considerable license to improvise the lines and influence character personality, and also performed the motion capture work for their characters. Many of the characters were meant to highlight different aspects of Drake's personality. Reception to the characters in the series have been fairly positive, with most commentators focusing on the believable nature of the characters and their interactions with each other. The inclusion of strong female characters has also received praise. The voice acting has also received acclaim, including two Interactive Achievement Award nominations. Creation and conception Illustrator and designer Kory Heinzen worked on pre-visualization and concept design for many of the characters in the Uncharted series. Early on, the Naughty Dog development team drew a number of concept sketches depicting characters hanging from cliffs and handling weapons awkwardly; many of these concepts directly translated into the final character products. The more fluid character motions were improvised on a motion capture stage, and were not scripted or drawn beforehand. Amy Hennig, the series writer, designed the character's personalities and mannerisms. The production team sought to capture a certain tone in the character design, and closely studied the pulp adventure genre for inspiration. This included drawing characteristics from Tintin, Doc Savage, and a number of movies. They tried to contrast with other western games, which lead game designer Richard Lemarchand described as \\"overwrought and all a bit emo.\\" The game developers and animators worked closely together to ensure that the expressions and movements of the characters matched with the desired tone of the games. The character designs were kept intentionally simple, as the designers wanted character personality defined by actor performances, rather than \\"trinkets attached to the character model.\\" Focus was instead placed on a realism in the animation to highlight character humanity. A blended animation system developed especially for the game allowed one character animation to begin before the previous one had ended, aiding this realism. The ultimate goal was to make the characters react as if they were real people in a realistic world. To accomplish this, many of the character reactions were conveyed through facial expressions and body language rather than explicit dialog. Hennig believes character emotion grew from the \\"production of the game as if it were a traditional movie or stage play.\\" The two lead actors were cast because of their experience on stage and film works. The cast had a large role in developing the characters. They were allowed to ad-lib dialog and participate in revising the script. The actors also read lines together on a sound stage, allowing them to play off of one another and organically grow the character relationships. Both games used the same actors for both motion capture and voice acting. The actors did a number of read-throughs and practiced to get the motions correct before capturing. Naughty Dog consciously avoided action game stereotypes, including super- powered heroes and overly sexualized female characters. They included a large cast of characters to ensure that the story was character-driven rather than story-driven. Co-president of Naughty Dog Evan Wells stated, \\"I honestly think that the key element, if you really want to boil it down, is characters. People will tell a story, but if it's not a character-driven plot then you are missing something.\\" Many of these characters were specifically designed to highlight different facets of Nathan Drake's personality. Main characters Nathan \\"Nate\\" Drake Nathan \\"Nate\\" Drake is the protagonist of the Uncharted series. Nolan North voices and gave the physical performance capture for Drake. North has had considerable influence in the development of the character, mixing his personality with Drake's. Drake is a playable character in five video games of the series: Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, and Uncharted: Golden Abyss. He is also the protagonist of the motion comic Uncharted: Eye of Indra. Drake is depicted as a professional treasure hunter with a shady background involving various people from the underground illegal goods market. He is highly intelligent, self-educated in history and various languages, and a supposed descendant of Sir Francis Drake. In the first two games, he seeks a mythical treasure. In Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, he uses the diary of Francis Drake to track the mythical El Dorado to a small island in the Pacific Ocean. He and his partner Victor Sullivan discover that El Dorado is actually a large golden statue that curses those who attempt to steal it.Nathan: Of course. 'El Dorado' ‚Äì 'the Golden Man'! Sully, it wasn't a city of gold, it was this. It was a golden idol. [...] I bet the Spanish dragged it out on cut logs. Huh... we're four hundred years late for this party. Nathan: We gotta stop 'em, Sully. They don't know what they're dealing with! Sully: What are you -? Nathan: I don't know how, but that statue destroyed the whole colony, and it killed the Germans too. [...] Sully: You wanna tell me what the hell's going on!? Nathan: Drake didn't want to get the treasure off the island, Sully. He was trying to stop it from leaving! Sully: What? Nathan: It's cursed or something. Sully: Oh, Nate, for God's sake... Drake must stop pirates led first by Gabriel Roman, and later Atoq Navarro and his mercenaries, from using the statue's power to turn people into zombies as a weapon. In the end, Drake succeeds in defeating Navarro, and returns home with Elena and Sullivan, who brought chests of treasure with him. In Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, he is hired by an old friend named Harry Flynn to help him steal an oil lamp from a museum that might point to the location of Marco Polo's lost fleet. When Flynn betrays him, Drake sets out to stop the former's employer and war criminal Zoran Lazareviƒá from discovering the location of Shambhala and the mystical Cintamani Stone. Drake tracks him to a monastery, where he discovers the entrance to Shambhala. Lazareviƒá locates and consumes part of the Tree of Life, but is bested in combat by Drake and killed by the guardians of Shambhala. In Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, Drake, Fisher and Sullivan journey to the lost city of Ubar in order to stop the leader of the old Hermetic Order and her associates from obtaining a psychological weapon from its waters. The game also explores the relationship between Drake and Sullivan, showing their first meeting when a 15-year-old Drake tried to steal a cipher device belonging to Sir Francis Drake. In the conclusion, Drake and Sullivan escape from the ruins of the lost city, Drake reconciles with Elena, and they leave together on Sullivan's new plane. In Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, a now-retired Nathan lives a happy and normal life with Fisher, until his long-lost older brother Samuel, presumed dead in a prison escape, appears and pulls Nathan back into his old life by feeding him a false story of a prison breakout involving notorious drug lord Hector Alc√°zar. Nathan ends up embarking on a globetrotting journey to the mythical lost city of Libertalia in search of Henry Avery's lost treasure, competing with a wealthy and cruel businessman named Rafe Adler, who happens to be a former associate of the Drakes and his associate Nadine Ross, who oversees a private military company.Nathan: ...not a sapphire Against the odds, Nathan manages to kill Rafe, saves his brother, and returns home with Elena. Years later, Nathan and Elena have become famous explorers and have a teenage daughter named Cassie. When Cassie finds relics from his previous adventures, they decide to tell her their stories. Naughty Dog gave Drake a very strong personality, as they did not want him to act blandly. He often thinks out loud, and comments and complains on the absurdity of his situations, a tendency Matt Casamassina of IGN called \\"lighthearted and amusing\\". Drake's appearance is generic, usually appearing in a plain shirt and jeans. This was to make him seem like an \\"ordinary guy\\". Throughout the series, he has various romantic interests. In the first game, there is tension between him and Elena Fisher, a reporter filming a documentary on his findings.Nathan: Sorry you didn't get your story. Elena: Ah, that's all right. There'll be other stories. You still owe me one. Nathan: I'm good for it. In Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, Drake enters an affair with his crime partner Chloe Frazer. However, by the course and end of the game, he has become involved with Elena Fisher again and by Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception he marries her. Elena Fisher Elena Fisher is Nathan Drake's love interest and later wife (having married him in Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception). Emily Rose voices Fisher, and also acted as her motion capture performer. In Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, she can be controlled during one sequence, where she fires a grenade launcher from the back of a personal water craft. She appears in all of the four video games in the series: Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. Elena is a professional journalist, who first focuses on documentary work, and then moves into news broadcast. In the first video game, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, Elena follows Drake, filming a documentary on his archaeological findings. Her network has instructed her to film him while he raises the coffin of Sir Francis Drake from the bottom of the ocean, which he locates from coordinates on a family heirloom ring he wears around his neck.Nathan: Don't I wish. No, this was, ah... this was Francis Drake's ring. I, y'know, kind of inherited it. Elena: \\"Sic parvis magna\\"? Nathan: \\"Greatness from small beginnings\\" ‚Äì it was his motto. Check out the date. Elena: 29th of January, 1596. Nathan: One day after he supposedly died. Elena: Wait, what are these numbers, right here? Nathan: Coordinates. Right off the coast of Panama. Elena: Oh, so that's how you found the coffin. After she and Drake are attacked by pirates and escape, he and Victor Sullivan abandon her to find the lost treasure of El Dorado. Despite Drake's attempts, Fisher manages to find him, but when they attempt to fly to another location, they are shot down by anti-aircraft fire. They meet up with Sullivan, who they thought had been killed.Elena: He's alive. Nathan: Huh. Elena: I don't know, Nate... I mean, how much do you trust this guy? It's not exactly like they're holding him at gunpoint. Nathan: I know. Yeah, it seems weird. But no. Sully's a lot of things, but he's not a back-stabber. Which way were they headed? Elena: Uh... North-ish. Yeah, towards the mountains. Nathan: Okay, it's gotta be the monastery. Let's go. After discovering that the statue is cursed, Drake must stop Gabriel Roman from using its power, and save Elena in the process. After doing so, Fisher, Drake, and Sullivan drive off into the sunset on a boat loaded with several crates of treasure. In Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, Fisher happens across him in Nepal. She now acts as an investigative journalist; she and her cameraman Jeff are attempting to prove that war criminal Zoran Lazareviƒá is alive, contrary to the beliefs of NATO. After Lazareviƒá executes her cameraman, she manages to escape with Drake. She goes ahead of him to a village in Tibet, where she meets Karl Sch√§fer, a German who had led a Schutzstaffel expedition to Shambhala. Drake and Fisher track Lazareviƒá to a monastery, where they find the entrance to Shambhala. Once inside, they discover that the monsters Drake has been seeing in the area are guardians of the city. Lazareviƒá apprehends them, but they escape when the guardians attack. Before he confronts Lazareviƒá, Drake's former partner Harry Flynn almost kills Fisher with a grenade. When Lazareviƒá is confronted, Drake defeats him, and leaves the guardians to kill him while Drake makes his escape. When she recuperates, the two return to the village and begin a relationship. Fisher returns in Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, where it is revealed that she and Drake have married and then separated in the period between the two games. Working on a story in Yemen, she is joined by her ex- husband and Sullivan, and joins their hunt for the city of Ubar. Over the course of the adventures, Drake and Fisher reconcile and resume wearing their wedding rings. In Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, Fisher is still married to Drake, leading a normal life with him at their home. When Drake is offered to do a profitable but illegal salvaging job by his colleague, Fisher encourages him to take the job, with Drake refusing to, insisting he is 'done' with that part of his life. However, the next day, Drake, lies to Fisher. Later, Fisher becomes suspicious and tracks him down, finding Drake looking for clues in Madagascar. Drake introduces Fisher to his brother, Sam, who is in debt to a drug lord. Hurt that Drake lied to her for weeks, Fisher leaves. Eventually, Fisher goes after Drake, and, with the help of Sullivan, finds him, wounded, in the island of the treasure's last sighting. As Fisher tended to Drake's wounds, he tells her everything about himself, such as how he came to know about the lost pirate treasure in his childhood, how his brother supposedly died and why he refused to make a mention of him after that. Afterwards, Fisher aids Drake in rescuing his brother. As they search for Sam, Drake apologizes for having lied to Fisher and confesses he felt afraid that he'd drive her away if he told her the truth, and the two reconcile. When they eventually rescue Sam and leave the island, Fisher and Drake part ways with Sam and Sullivan and return home. Back home, Fisher reveals that she bought the company Drake currently works at so that they can continue having more adventures, claiming to have missed that part of life much to Drake's surprise. Years later, Fisher and Drake have become well-known explorers and have a daughter named Cassandra, who they named after Drake's mother. When Cassandra discovers relics from her parents' adventures, Fisher and Drake decide to tell her about them. Naughty Dog designed Fisher as a sidekick and a romantic interest to Drake, and her personality to complement his. However, she proves just as capable as Drake at gun battles and resourcefulness. Her voice actor, Emily Rose, commented, \\"In the first game, she's a lot younger, she's a lot more naive, and she looks at things as being very possible, and in the second (game), has seen murders and adventure...the way that any person grows, you see that in her. She's a little bit more hesitant, a little more cynical\\". Commentators have mentioned how unusually strong and resilient Fisher is for a female character, and GamesRadar UK called her one of the strongest heroines in video gaming. Victor \\"Sully\\" Sullivan Victor \\"Sully\\" Sullivan is a longtime partner of Nathan Drake and a treasure hunter as well. Sullivan has mentored Drake for some time, and is a father figure for him. Richard McGonagle voices Sullivan for all four games in the series. Sullivan first appears near the beginning of Uncharted: Drake's Fortune when he rescues Drake and Fisher from a pirate attack at sea with his seaplane. Sullivan and Drake quickly abandon Fisher, using a map found in the coffin of Francis Drake to hunt down the treasure of El Dorado. After discovering that the Spanish had removed the statue centuries before, the two come across a U-boat in the middle of the jungle. There, Gabriel Roman takes Sullivan hostage, eventually shooting him.Nathan: UK2642... you got that? [...] It's Kriegsmarine coordinates. I think I know where the Spanish took El Dorado. [...] The problem is, so do the bastards who killed Sully. Damn it! If the Spanish found the treasure, they had to've moved it there, to that island. And Drake followed 'em. Though presumed dead, Sullivan shows up later, and Drake must rescue him from a group of mercenaries, who are forcing him to help them find the statue. Sullivan manages to mislead his captors, allowing him and Drake to escape. The two realize that the statue is cursed, and Sullivan provides cover fire for Drake as he attempts to stop Atoq Navarro, Roman's right-hand man, from taking the statue to sell as a biological weapon. After Drake succeeds, Sullivan arrives in a boat full of several crates of treasure, and picks up Drake and Elena. Sullivan appears briefly near the beginning of the 2009 video game Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. He first shows up to bail Drake out of jail, using the remainder of his fortune and some of his own money to bribe officials into doing so. Afterward, the two go after Zoran Lazareviƒá in Borneo. After destroying the base there, he is not seen again until the final cutscene of the game. He also appears as a playable character in the multiplayer part of the game. He has a major role in Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception where he joins Nathan in the search for Ubar and their close relationship is the main focus of the game; in flashbacks, it is revealed that Sullivan took in a 15-year-old Nathan out of pity, and he was also revealed to have worked for the leader of the Hermetic Order, who he and Drake are currently fighting at the present. He appears in Uncharted: Golden Abyss, set before Drake's Fortune, towards the end where he helps Nathan rescue Marisa Chase. Sullivan returns for a final time in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, where he is revealed to have lost contact with Nate following Ubar. When Drake comes out of retirement to help his long-lost brother Sam, whose life is in danger as he is under the debt of notorious drug lord Hector Alc√°zar, he contacts Sullivan who aids them in searching for Henry Avery's treasure, which Alc√°zar demands and facing fierce competition from Rafe Adler and Nadine Ross, the latter of whom he has history with.At the end of the game he and Sam partner up after Nate and Elena return home and both continue to be in touch with the latter two and by the events of the epilogue, have quit smoking. Sullivan is a business partner of Drake's. He was meant to act, not only as a partner, but as a mentor to the main character, and to provide insight into his criminal activities. In all games, Sullivan wears a guayabera-style shirt with khaki pants and smokes cigars. He is constantly in debt, but is likable enough to convince people to invest in his ventures. In Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, it is revealed that Sullivan used to be in the (likely American) Navy, adding star-based navigation to his wide array of skills. This is also a major plot point in the game, as he is captured for his knowledge of the location of Iram of the Pillars thanks to said skill. =In other media= Stephen Lang played Sully in the 2018 live action fan film. Mark Wahlberg will portray Sully in the upcoming 2021 film adaptation. Chloe Frazer Chloe Frazer is Nathan Drake's other love interest. She appears in the second video game, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, and Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. Claudia Black voices the character. Black's interactions with Drake's voice actor Nolan North played a large role in developing the character. In Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, Frazer begins as a business associate of Drake and Harry Flynn when a benefactor hires the group to steal an oil lamp from a Turkish museum. She and Drake had a romantic relationship sometime before the events of the game, which they covertly resume until Flynn betrays Drake and he ends up in a Turkish jail. Frazer bails him out and joins forces with Drake and Sullivan. She then begins traveling with Flynn and Lazareviƒá, acting as a double agent, and discovers that they are after the fabled city of Shambhala and the Cintamani stone, seeking immortality. Although her loyalty is called into question multiple times over the course of the game, she chooses to help Drake defeat Lazareviƒá in Shambhala.Chloe: (after giving the key to Shambhala to Drake) ...Just... Just do one thing for me. Take that son-of-a-bitch down. Her feelings for Drake are complicated, and she ends up voluntarily ending the relationship once she sees he is in love with Elena Fisher. Chloe returns in Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, working with Drake, Sullivan and Charlie Cutter, acting as getaway driver during their initial confrontation with Katherine Marlowe's secret organization. She travels to Syria in search of the treasured city of Ubar, but drops out of the mission to tend to Cutter after he breaks his leg and can't continue. While not appearing in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, she is briefly mentioned at the start of the game, when Nathan reads a letter of hers stating that if Nate ever needs to return to treasure hunting, she is available. Chloe returns in the game Uncharted: The Lost Legacy as the main protagonist, where she partners with reformed Uncharted 4 antagonist Nadine Ross and Nate's brother Sam Drake in finding the Tusk of Ganesha in India's Western Ghats. Her backstory is also revealed, her father was an Indian treasure hunter who was killed by bandits while he was also in search of the Tusk. Series writer Amy Hennig designed Frazer to act as a foil to Drake, as such, she acts to highlight various parts of his personality. She contrasts to other main characters, and is essentially a darker version of Drake, and the \\"bad girl\\" version of Fisher. Frazer is a professional thief, and often acts impulsively. She looks out for herself above all other people. She is a strong female character, and is very sexually forward compared to other women in video games. Tom Cross of Gamasutra commented that she was perhaps a first in video games as a confident woman every bit the equal of the lead male character. Samuel \\"Sam\\" Drake Samuel \\"Sam\\" Drake is the older brother of Nathan Drake, formerly believed to have died before the events of the first game. He appears in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, and is voiced by Troy Baker and Chase Austin (the latter as teenage Samuel). When they were young, Samuel broke into the orphanage he was thrown out of to get to Nathan and tell him that he is moving out of town for a job. To make up, Samuel led Nathan to the house of Evelyn, a historian who was legally sold their mother's belongings. They attempted to retrieve the items, but were caught. Evelyn called the police before she found out that the boys were the offspring of Cassandra Morgan, a favourite employee of hers. Evelyn collapsed from a lung disease, and the boys were associated with her death. They fled, and Samuel prompted Nathan that they could become explorers under the new surname of Drake, claiming to know some people who could help them with that. It is implied that Samuel, around 19 or 20 years old, was in jail somewhere when Nathan stole Francis Drake's ring in Colombia and first met Sully, harbouring a distrust towards the latter. Samuel supposedly died while he, Nathan and their associate Rafe Adler attempted to find the whereabouts of Henry Avery's Gunsway haul in a Panamanian prison. Nathan and Rafe escaped, while Samuel was shot and presumed dead by the former two. In reality, he was imprisoned indefinitely after his wounds were tended to and his existence was kept secret as punishment due to Rafe having killed the corrupt guard who aided them, unbeknownst to a distraught Nathan. 15 years later, he tracks down a retired Nathan and convinces him to pick up where they left off in the search for the Gunsway haul by feeding Nathan a false breakout story. The story involves notorious drug lord Hector Alc√°zar, who broke Samuel free and demanded half of the treasure of the Gunsway in exchange for his life being spared. These events kick off the main story of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. It is later revealed that Rafe released Samuel with a bribe two years prior, and that Samuel double-crossed Rafe to resume the search with Nathan. After the events of the game, he partners with Sullivan, with whom he mended his trust issues for a job that requires Portuguese language skills, in which Samuel is gifted. Samuel returns in Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, with Baker reprising the role again, where he is revealed to have teamed with Chloe Frazer in finding the Tusk of Ganesh prior to being kidnapped by Asav, the main antagonist of the game, leading to Chloe enlisting the help of Nadine Ross. Throughout the majority of the game, he pretends to be a Hoysala expert for Asav until he is rescued by Chloe and Nadine, the latter of whom he was initially at odds with due to their last encounter in Libertalia and the fact that he and Nathan killed most of the Shoreline men; he eventually partly makes amends with her. He also states that he plans on quitting smoking, which he does eventually by the epilogue of A Thief's End alongside Sully. Nadine Ross Nadine Ross first appears as the secondary antagonist in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. She is voiced and motion-captured by Laura Bailey. During the events of A Thief's End, she is the leader of the South African private military company Shoreline, and forms a partnership with Rafe Adler in finding Henry Avery's lost treasure. They attempt to buy a St. Dismas Cross at an auction in Italy, where she sees Victor Sullivan, with whom she is acquainted. When they fail to acquire the cross due to Nathan Drake cutting off the power, Ross confronts him elsewhere and the two briefly fight, but Nathan escapes with the cross. Adler hacks into Nathan and Sam's phones, using their GPS to track them to Madagascar. Along the way, Ross slowly loses patience with Adler, citing the loss of her troops for something that they may not find, and numerous times advocates for Adler to kill Nathan and Samuel, which he refuses to do. In the game's climax, Ross and Adler succeed in pillaging a portion of Avery's treasure and is content with leaving afterwards, unwilling to risk falling into Avery's traps aboard the ship and even ready to let Samuel and Nathan keep the rest if they can avoid the traps, though Adler coerces her into aiding him by turning her men against her. Aboard the ship, however, a trap is sprung by Samuel himself and the ship begins to sink. Finally fed up of Adler's greed and grudges, Ross betrays Adler and at gunpoint abandons him to die aboard the ship with Nathan and Samuel while she escapes with the rest of her men. Nadine returns in Uncharted: The Lost Legacy after agreeing to partner with Chloe Frazer in helping her find the Tusk of Ganesh in the mountains of India. It is revealed she has left Shoreline following her dispute with Rafe and subsequent betrayal by her lieutenant Orca, although she plans to retake the company once she fulfills her commitment with Frazer. She later finds out Samuel Drake, her former enemy, is also partnered with Frazer, and though initially at odds with him, eventually begins to put the grudge aside and works with him to stop Asav. After finally catching up with Asav, she discovers that Shoreline, now led by Orca, have resorted to working with the insurgent leader by agreeing to offer him munitions in exchange for the Tusk. After helping Chloe force Orca from his helicopter, she remonstrates him for associating with Asav, before shooting him dead in return fire whilst she is saved by Sam. After helping defeat Asav, she tells Chloe and Samuel that she has finally moved on from retaking Shoreline and instead plans to pursue further work in fortune hunting, hinting at more adventures alongside Chloe. Charlie Cutter Charlie Cutter first appears in Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He is a cockney friend of Nate, Sully and Chloe and is also shown to know Elena to some extent when she inquires about his well-being. It is apparent that he suffers from severe claustrophobia, requiring a lot of prompting just to squeeze through tight spaces. He is first introduced as one of Marlowe's henchmen, although it is soon apparent that he was an inside man. He helps Drake, Frazer, and Sullivan in the first part of the game with finding the clues to the location of Ubar, the Atlantis of the Sands. He is injured when jumping off a tower in Syria and tells Nathan to go on and stop Marlowe out of revenge. Despite looking like a blunt, common thug, he appears to be well educated, quoting John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men and correcting Sullivan's mistake when quoting Macbeth. He is voiced by and modeled after Graham McTavish, who previously voiced Lazareviƒá in the second game. Cutter does not appear in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, although he is mentioned by Drake as a trusted associate when he initially tries to decline his brother Sam's request for help. According to Naughty Dog, Cutter was originally supposed to remain by the protagonists' side until the final battle with Katherine Marlowe and Talbot, but McTavish was forced to drop out in order to fly to New Zealand after landing a role in The Hobbit. Cutter's role was therefore reduced to only the first half of the game. Rika Raja Rika Raja appears in the motion comic Uncharted: Eye of Indra. While she never appears in any of the single-player campaign games, she can be purchased as a skin for the Uncharted 2: Among Thieves multiplayer mode. She is voiced by Gwendoline Yeo in the motion comics. Rika saves Nathan's life from two thugs that get in a fight with him in her bar. She then decides to help Drake on his mission to steal the Eye of Indra from Daniel Pinkerton. She double crosses Nathan as well as her older brother Eddy, leaving with the Eye of Indra. Marisa Chase Marisa Chase appears only in Uncharted: Golden Abyss, where she is voiced by Christine Lakin. She is the granddaughter of deceased archaeologist Vincent Perez. She carries a golden amulet, which was very important to her grandfather. She lived her youth with Perez because her parents were shot when she was very young. She, just like Drake, got her climbing, knowledge of ancient artifacts and treasure hunting skills at age of 15. She has a problem trusting people who she doesn't know, and exceptions are displayed through her use of the word \\"partner\\" to refer to close allies. Her biggest difference from Elena is that she never uses a gun, even when she is getting shot at. She survives an RPG shot from antagonist Roberto Guerro during the events of the game. She finally decides to use a gun near the end of the game. Antagonists Atoq Navarro Atoq Navarro is a South American archaeologist and main antagonist of Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, voiced and motion captured by Robin Atkin Downes. At first, he is the lieutenant of Gabriel Roman, and helps him hold Sullivan and Drake hostage. He also leads a team of highly trained mercenaries hired by Roman. Though never made into a chapter, there was a drafted sequence where Nathan and Elena attempt to sneak into an airship to get to an island in search of El Dorado, but the area was infested by Navarro's mercenaries. After killing them, Navarro appears in an armored truck and begins firing at them with a machine gun. Nathan knocks a telephone pole onto his truck using explosive barrels, and escapes on the plane with Elena. Sometime later, he and Roman travel to the island so Roman can find and sell El Dorado for a lot of money, which Sullivan owes him (whom they took with them when Nathan thought he was dead), unaware that Navarro has his own plan of selling it. Eventually, they team up with Eddy Raja, who is also searching for the statue of El Dorado, and try to keep Nathan away from it. When Roman finally has the statue, Navarro reveals that he has planned to double-cross him the whole time. He convinces Roman to open the statue, fully aware it was actually a sarcophagus containing an infected mummy and of the zombification effects the pathogen it contains will have on the man; after that, he kills him with a gunshot to the head. It turns out Navarro planned to take the virus and sell it as a biological weapon to the highest bidder. After he leaves holding Elena at gunpoint, the statue is airlifted by his helicopter. However, the zombified Spaniards of the island, known as \\"Descendants\\", invade the chamber, attacking his mercenaries. Nathan manages to jump onto the airlifted statue. A mercenary notices this, and tries to shoot Drake, but Elena kicks him out of the helicopter, causing him to shoot the pilot and sending the helicopter crashing onto Navarro's boat. An unarmed Nathan fights Navarro, who is armed with his laser sight-equipped SPAS-12. After the fight, Nathan pushes the crashed helicopter into the ocean, with the rope used to airlift the statue wrapping around Navarro's ankle and dragging him into the water.Nathan: Elena! Oh God... Elena. C'mon. Can you stand? Elena: I'm okay... I'm okay. Nathan: Are you all right? Elena: Oh ‚Äì Nate! Nathan turns to see Navarro standing up. Nathan: Watch out. Nathan pushes the helicopter off the side of the platform. Nathan: Adios, asshole. Navarro: Huh? The rope connecting the statue and the helicopter is tangled in his legs and drags him across the floor and into the sea. Elena: Oh my ‚Äì Sully's boat arrives, and they wave to him. Elena: Oh... Quite a day. Gabriel Roman Gabriel Roman is the secondary antagonist of Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, though he is built up to be the main villain until the game's climax. He is voiced by Simon Templeman. Roman first arrives while Drake and Sullivan are exploring the wreckage of a Kriegsmarine U-boat beached in the Amazon Rainforest. Roman, leader of a group of pirates and mercenaries, has loaned Sullivan a large sum of money in the past. Sullivan had called him, assuring him that he would soon find \\"something big\\", and then have the money to pay Roman back. Roman, however, decides to steal the information that Drake and Sullivan have gathered and find the treasure for himself. To force Drake into compliance, Roman holds Sullivan hostage, and eventually shoots him, nearly fatally. Roman discovers the directions to El Dorado, but fails to capture Fisher and Drake.Elena: We're on the trail at the lost treasure of El Dorado and it's brought us here to this tiny island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Roman forces Sullivan to work with him in finding the treasure. Despite numerous warnings that the treasure and the island are haunted,Eddy: It's not just Drake, goddamn it! I'm telling you, this island is cursed! Roman continues to use his men in search of the treasure.Nathan: It's Drake. He never found it. He just... died here. Roman captures Fisher, but Drake and Sullivan catch up to him, just in time to see Roman about to leave with the statue. However, Navarro tells Roman the real treasure is inside the statue. Roman opens the statue to collect the riches inside. As soon as Roman does, he sees that the statue is actually a sarcophagus containing a mummy infected with an airborne mutagenic virus. He slams it shut, but it is too late and he is infected. Angered at this betrayal, Roman savagely charges towards Navarro, who shoots Roman in the head and reveals to Drake that he intended to sell the statue as a weapon the whole time.Nathan: Navarro, that thing wiped out an entire colony. You don't know what you're doing. Navarro: Wrong. I'm the only person on this island who knows what the hell he's doing! [...] You are so pathetic, all of you scrambling around for your petty treasures. Do you have any idea what this is worth, to the right buyer? Gabriel: It's magnificent. The craftsmanship, I've never seen anything like it before. Navarro: That is only a shell. The real treasure of El Dorado lies inside. Open it. Gabriel pries open the statue. There is nothing inside but a rotting corpse. Nathan: My God... Dust billows out from the mouth of the corpse. Gabriel inhales the dust and starts coughing. Navarro: Watch this. Still coughing, Gabriel closes the statue and falls to his knees, gasping for breath. Gabriel: Navarro... Eddy Raja Eddy Raja, voiced by James Sie, is an old rival of Nathan Drake and the leader of a group of Indonesian pirates.Nathan and Elena have just escaped Eddy's clutches. Elena: So who was that guy? Nathan: Just an old business asso ‚Äì OH LOOK OUT! Raja first met Drake before the events of Uncharted: Eye of Indra, where they worked together on a job. Drake double-crosses him, however, and Eddy continues to hold a grudge.Rika: Wow, what did you do to him? Nathan: It was an old job, he was gonna dick me over and I beat him to the punch. Apparently he's not over it yet. Raja again encounters Drake during Eye of Indra, where Drake enlists his help in stealing the valuable Eye of Indra from Daniel Pinkerton. In Drake's Fortune, Eddy and his gang are hired by Gabriel Roman. Raja helps Roman capture Drake, though he and Fisher escape. After large numbers of his men begin mysteriously dying, Raja becomes convinced that the island is cursed, and tries to convince Roman to stop looking for the treasure. When he does so, Roman accuses him of cowardice and fires him; Raja pulls a gun on Roman, but is stopped by Navarro. Raja is next seen looking for the treasure himself, and tries to have Drake killed one last time by sending the last of his men after him and Fisher. When Drake and Fisher find the room where El Dorado is supposedly located, they are followed by Raja and his last surviving pirate, running from a large number of cursed Spaniards. He and Drake briefly work together to fight the creatures while Elena tries to find a way out for them. During the gun battle, Raja takes his opportunity to tell Drake how much he hates him, though it may also be his way of admitting that despite their animosity, he always held a begrudging respect for Drake. Eventually, Raja is dragged down a hole by one of the so-called \\"Descendants\\" after being bitten and is presumed dead. His famous line is \\"Don't mess with Eddy Raja!\\"Nathan: Eddy, get back here. Oh crap. Eddy: Drake, if we don't make it out of here, I just want you to know ‚Äì I hate your guts. Nathan: Yeah, likewise pal. Now let's do this. Zoran Lazareviƒá Zoran Lazareviƒá is the main antagonist of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. He is voiced by Graham McTavish. The majority of the world believes he is dead after a bombing, but he survives with half of his face scarred. Lazareviƒá pays Flynn to betray Drake, tricking him into giving Flynn information on the location of Marco Polo's lost fleet and causing Drake's arrest. In reality, Lazareviƒá wants to possess the mythical Cintamani Stone, which the fleet was supposedly transporting. He discovers that the fleet never had the stone, and dispatches a group of mercenaries to Nepal for clues to the location of the legendary city of Shambhala. He incites a civil war in the region to aid in his search and distract from any possible discovery. In Nepal, Lazareviƒá personally executes Fisher's cameraman Jeff, and follows Drake after he discovers the location of Shambhala's entrance. Lazareviƒá invades the small Tibetan village harboring Drake and Fisher, seeking the key to reveal Shambhala. He kidnaps Sch√§fer and forces him to reveal the general area of the entrance. When Drake and Fisher follow, Lazareviƒá apprehends them and forces Drake to reveal the entrance to Shambhala. There, he drinks the sap of the Tree of Life. He battles Drake with his newfound powers, but is defeated by Drake and beaten by the guardians of Shambhala, supposedly being killed when the temple falls apart. He appears later along with Harry Flynn and Eddy Raja in the online co-op story in Uncharted 3. Lazareviƒá uses a double-barreled shotgun as his main weapon.Lazarevic: You don't have the will. Nathan: Maybe not. But they do. Lazareviƒá was originally meant to be portrayed by Jonathan Banks, but the role ultimately went to McTavish. Harry Flynn Harry Flynn is a longtime business associate of Drake's and an antagonist of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. He is voiced by Steve Valentine. In the second game, he approaches Drake, convincing him to help steal an oil lamp from a Turkish museum for a wealthy client. The two, along with Frazer, plan to keep the lamp for themselves, believing it will lead to the location of Marco Polo's lost fleet and the treasures it holds. In reality, Flynn is working for Lazareviƒá, and betrays Drake, taking the location coordinates and landing Drake in prison.Flynn: Face it, genius. You've been played. He then works with Lazareviƒá in searching for the Cintamani Stone. When Lazareviƒá apprehends Drake, he has Flynn force him to find the location of the entrance to Shambhala. There, Lazareviƒá and his men, Flynn, Drake and company are attacked by the Guardians, where Flynn is gravely wounded due to a gunshot wound from Lazareviƒá, his employer having grown tired of his failures. Flynn ultimately commits suicide with a grenade while attempting to blow up Drake, but severely wounds Fisher instead.Flynn: Parting gift from Lazarevic. Pity he took the pin. Naughty Dog used the dialogue in the game to hint at the relationship between Drake and Flynn, but desired ambiguity regarding the exact nature of their past dealings, and to show what Drake could have become. Flynn mainly served to hint at a darker past where Drake was less heroic. Flynn was not written as a British character; the casting of a British actor was mere coincidence. In the early stages of casting, Graham McTavish was Naughty Dog's first choice for Flynn. However, Valentine's audition caused them to reconsider and McTavish was instead given the role of Lazareviƒá. Lt. Draza Lt. Draza is Zoran Lazareviƒá's right-hand man and an antagonist of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. He is voiced by Michael Benyaer in Uncharted 2 and by Fred Tatasciore in Uncharted 3 multiplayer. Draza is first seen with Lazareviƒá in Nepal, when they first meet Nathan face to face. Lazareviƒá gives him the Phurba from Nate. Later, when Chloe is taken to the train by Flynn, Nathan tries to save her, but runs into Draza, who is in charge of the train. The two fight until Drake knocks out Draza and takes back the Phurba. Draza wakes up and tries to strangle Drake, but is shot dead from behind by Chloe. According to some articles, Draza and Lazareviƒá have known each other for a long time. He uses an M4 carbine (a misnamed Colt Model 723) as his main weapon. Daniel Pinkerton Daniel Pinkerton is the main antagonist of the Uncharted: Eye of Indra motion comic. Fred Tatasciore provides his voice. Pinkerton is an American who has become a crime boss in Indonesia. Pinkerton hires Drake, who is seeking the funds to raise the coffin of Francis Drake, to find the valuable Eye of Indra. After discovering that Pinkerton has unknowingly had the Eye in his safe the whole time, Drake attempts to retrieve it by raiding Pinkerton's home.Drake: He hid [the Eye of Indra] in the statue. The same statue that's in Pinkerton's safe. Rika: You're just going to tell Pinkerton he already has the amulet? Drake: I'm not telling that asshole anything. I'm going to rob him. Pinkerton captures Drake, and tortures him when he refuses to reveal the treasure's location. When Drake eventually reveals the location of the Eye of Indra, Rika Raja shoots and kills Pinkerton, and the two take the Eye of Indra for themselves. Katherine Marlowe Katherine Marlowe is the main antagonist of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. She is the coldly calculating leader of a secret society whose roots date back over four hundred years to the court of Queen Elizabeth I. She has a long-standing rivalry with Nathan Drake over Sir Francis Drake‚Äôs ring ‚Äì something they both contend is rightfully theirs and is also the key to an ancient mystery. Katherine Marlowe is a much more cerebral enemy than Drake has confronted in the past, using both psychological and physical tactics to get what she is after. Marlowe also has the assistance of her team of highly trained agents in this secret society ‚Äì they are far more elusive and dangerous than the hired guns Nathan Drake and Victor Sullivan have faced before. She treats her subordinates with slight disdain, being annoyed with Talbot for hiring Charlie Cutter. Marlowe appears to have studied Nathan's past and reveals that he's not actually the direct descendant of Sir Francis Drake ‚Äì he was merely in an orphanage named after the great explorer. She first meets a teenage Drake in Colombia, forcing him to give her the cipher disk he had just stolen from a museum to her but fails to get Sir Francis Drake's ring when he runs off. Twenty years later, she meets with Drake in an alleyway and steals his ring. However, she soon discovers it's a fake and promptly loses both the disc and the ring when Drake takes both. Marlowe then sends Talbot and her agents to France and Syria, successfully getting the clues to the location of Ubar. She then captures Nathan and Sullivan and leaves for the lost city. Nathan eventually finds her using a winch to drag out King Solomon's hallucinogenic Talisman from the lakes in Ubar and destroys the foundations of the city, causing Marlowe to fall into a pool of quicksand. Though Drake attempts to save her, Marlowe submerges and dies, taking Sir Francis's ring with her. Marlowe is voiced by Rosalind Ayres and appears to be modelled after actress Helen Mirren. In 2013, Liz Lanier of Game Informer included Marlowe among top ten female villains in video games, stating that \\"Marlowe is the definition of a power lady. She runs the Hermetic Order, a secret organization that will do anything to find the Atlantis of the Sands. Marlowe will still take any opportunity to belittle Drake and others that get in her way on a personal level on top of taking violent action.\\" Talbot Talbot is Marlowe's right-hand man and the secondary antagonist of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He is voiced by Robin Atkin Downes. He is the one who hired Charlie Cutter to provide security for the deal in the first level. He has an intense rivalry with Nathan Drake and, according to the developers, acts as the \\"anti-Drake\\", with similar looks and free running skills to rival Drake's own. Talbot is always by Marlowe's side, and later orders Cutter to shoot Nathan and Sullivan. Despite his unassuming appearance, he is an extremely dangerous hand-to-hand combatant, able to use a combat knife with high proficiency as seen in his final confrontation with Drake and Sullivan in the collapsing city of Ubar. He also has a special weapon: a dart gun loaded with a special drug which grants him some hypnotic influence over people (he uses it to make Cutter disarm himself). Despite being treated with near indifference, he appears to care deeply for Marlowe, begging Nathan to save her from being consumed by the quicksand in Ubar, and is driven mad when Drake fails. He tries to murder Drake on top of a collapsing cliff overlooking the Iram of the pillars but is briefly distracted by Sullivan who shoots him in the shoulder with a Walther P99. He is then finally killed by Drake who shoots him in the head before he can crush Sullivan's skull with a rock, leading him to plummet to his death. He is an expert at mind control and seems capable of appearing and disappearing almost at will and surviving being shot at point blank. However, due to his mind tricks, it is difficult to tell for sure if he can appear out of nowhere or disappear at will and sustain much bullet damage. After brainwashing Cutter, he manages to vanish before the rest of the team arrive. Cutter shoots him at point blank, but he does not appear to suffer much from it. He manages to attack Sullivan by surprise on a walkway with no place to sneak behind him. He manages to catch up with Drake and Sullivan when the whole place collapses ‚Äì which is either possible thanks to his free running abilities or his unexplained ability to appear and disappear almost at will. Rameses Rameses, voiced by Sayed Badreya, is an antagonist of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. Shortly after Drake is knocked out by Rameses, he is taken to a shipyard where he is tied to a chair. Rameses demands Drake to tell him where Atlantis of the Sands is located. When Drake tells Rameses that he honestly did not know, Rameses walks out and threatens to interrogate Sullivan. After Drake manages to break free and defeat all of the guards, he climbs onto Rameses' cruise ship. From there he finds a decoy of Sullivan and realizes that he was never there to begin with. Rameses tells him that he lied ‚Äì he is after all a pirate. Drake then shoots him, critically wounding him. After Drake makes his way into the ball room (the ship turned onto its side at this point because it was sinking), Rameses shoots the glass window and causes the rest of the ship to flood, dying in the process. Drake however survives by drifting to shore on a piece of flotsam. Roberto Guerro Roberto Guerro is the main antagonist of Uncharted: Golden Abyss, voiced and motion-captured by JB Blanc. A decade before Golden Abyss, Roberto Guerro was the military dictator of Panama before being overthrown by a coup d'√©tat. He escaped execution by the new regime and, accompanied by loyalists, formed a revolutionary army to hound government forces and eventually regain power. However, Guerro quickly realised that without a good source of funds, he would be unable to compete with the military strength of a new government, so he indulged in abductions and drug running to build up the cash. Shortly before Golden Abyss, Guerro had enough money to equip his army with guns, turrets, vehicles and explosives, but still needed more. He was approached by an archaeologist, Vincent Perez, and his partner Jason Dante, who wished to investigate ruins within Guerro's territory on a potential lead to Quivira, one of the Seven Cities of Gold. Guerro agreed, presumably planning to kill both Perez and Dante when he had the gold, which he would use to fund the revolution. After Perez's disappearance, he allowed Dante to take over the excavation only if he complied with orders. Guerro interrogates both Chase and Dante after he captures Drake. Chase manages to escape with Drake and her amulet. Guerro captures Chase and steals the sword of Stephen from Drake. Drake and Sullivan find the Serpent Temple where Dante's mercenaries and Guerro's thugs are fighting. Guerro critically wounds Chase with an RPG before being thrown off a bridge by Nate. Jason Dante Jason Dante is an old friend of Drake's who halfway helps him find a lost city of Spaniards, and an antagonist of Uncharted: Golden Abyss. He is voiced by Jason Spisak. He has a rivalry with Marisa Chase, and after he betrays Drake, the latter teams up with Marisa to stop Dante and his band of pirates. A Geiger counter in Chase's pack indicates that the gold in the Throne of Gold is radioactive. Dante arrives and reveals he knew about the treasure being radioactive and plans to strip-mine Quivira and litter the gold through the black market. Nathan and Dante get into an intense fist-fight with Nathan coming out on top. Nathan and Chase leave Dante by the Throne of Gold after he refuses Nate's offer to leave with him and Chase. Chase then detonates the bombs in the caverns to seal it. As she and Nathan flee, the caverns begin to collapse, killing Dante and any of his mercenaries still in the cave system. Dante is known for his greed, even while he and Nathan were friends, and it becomes his undoing.UNCHARTED: Golden Abyss for PS Vita ‚Äì Meet Marisa Chase Rafe Adler Rafe Adler is the main antagonist in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. He is voiced and motion- captured by Warren Kole. He is a wealthy businessman and treasure hunter as well as an old acquaintance of the Drake brothers, working with them by infiltrating a Panamanian prison to find clues regarding the whereabouts of legendary pirate Henry Avery's lost fortune. When Vargas, the corrupt prison warden, who was bribed into aiding the trio, demands a share of the treasure, Adler kills him and they attempt to escape the prison pursued by guards. Sam is apparently killed in the ensuing shootout and Nate after briefly working with Adler following the escape eventually loses interest in finding the treasure, forcing Adler to continue alone. Thirteen years later, Adler enlists the help of Nadine Ross and her private military company, Shoreline, to aid in finding the treasure. Adler also discovers that Sam survived and arranges for his release from prison to enlist his aid as well, but he defects and approaches a now retired Nathan, leaving an enraged Adler to search himself. He comes into contact with the protagonists at an auction in Italy, subtly warning Victor Sullivan to stay out of his way, though he fails to obtain the St. Dismas Cross when it is stolen by Sam and Nate. Adler, however, hacks into their phones and uses their GPS to track them to King's Bay, Madagascar where he again tries to force Nate to walk away in exchange for being spared to no avail. Later, on the island in which Libertalia is located, he reveals he had Sam released. After a brief scuffle, Adler forces Sam to lead him to the treasure, though he manages to escape. Adler and Ross eventually reach Avery's ship, though by now, Ross has lost patience with Adler, further exacerbated when he seemingly almost let her die during the scuffle with Sam, and demands that they leave with a portion of the loot, fearing that Avery's ship is rigged with traps. Adler refuses and turns Ross's men against her to coerce her into helping him. Inside the ship, however, a trap is sprung and Adler confronts Nate and an injured Sam inside the brig. Ross, finally fed up betrays Adler and abandons him to die with Nate. In his rage, Adler grabs a sword and duels Nathan, and though he has the upper hand, Nathan unloads a net of heavy treasure onto Adler, crushing and killing him. Hector Alc√°zar Hector Alc√°zar is a drug lord and the false main antagonist in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. He is voiced and motion-captured by Robin Atkin Downes. Initially, Samuel told Nathan that Alc√°zar was his cellmate, and Alc√°zar's men helped break the both of them out of the Panamanian Prison. In exchange, Alc√°zar bargains with Samuel that he has three months to find Avery's treasure. However, it was later revealed that Alc√°zar was killed in a shootout in Argentina six months prior to the current events of Uncharted 4 and Sam's story was a lie to get Nathan to help him find the treasure before Rafe Adler and Nadine Ross. Vargas Vargas, voiced by Hemky Madera, is a minor antagonist in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. He is a corrupt prison guard who first appears in a flashback prior to the events of the present day, where he is bribed into helping the Drake brothers and Rafe in finding Avery's treasure in a Panamanian prison. He is later killed by Rafe when he troubles the treasure hunters by trying to get a cut of their treasure, though not before alerting the guards with gunfire. His death is the reason why Sam spends thirteen years in prison after he was shot during their escape. Gustavo Gustavo, voiced by Alejandro Edda, is a minor antagonist in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End where he appears fighting Nathan in prison. He and his gang later ambush Nathan, Samuel and Rafe after they examine a St. Dismas Cross which Nathan found. He is however interrupted by the prison guards and subdued by Vargas, who was bribed by the treasure hunters to protect them from being harmed by other inmates. Orca Orca, voiced by Gideon Emery, is a mercenary employed by the private military company Shoreline. During Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, he is a lieutenant under the command of Nadine Ross. After their client Rafe Adler finds Captain Avery's treasure on-board his booby- trapped pirate ship, a bribed Orca draws his gun on Ross after she protests Adler on risking further danger in boarding the ship, betraying her command. Orca later appears in Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, taking command of Shoreline after Ross departs from the company, and has struck a deal with an Indian insurgency force headed by Asav. He purchases the Tusk of Ganesh from Asav with a bomb that the insurgent leader (Asav) plans to detonate in a nearby city to ignite a revolution. Orca later gets attacked by Ross and her associate Chloe Frazer inside his helicopter before it crashes to the ground, severely injuring him. After implying that he sold a bomb to Asav and giving up the Tusk, he quickly tries to shoot Ross, but gets killed in return fire after she is saved by Samuel Drake. Asav Asav, voiced by Usman Ally, is the main antagonist of Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. The head of an Indian military insurgency force, he competes with Chloe and Nadine in finding the Tusk of Ganesh in India, and has captured Samuel Drake and used him as a Hoysala expert until Chloe and Nadine rescue him. He manages to capture both Chloe and Nadine within the hidden city of Belur, and threatens to torture Ross and Drake to force Frazer to solve a puzzle that will reveal the Tusk. After taking the Tusk, he leaves a handcuffed Frazer, Ross, and Drake to drown in the Tusk's chamber, which fills with water as Asav and his men make their escape. He is revealed to have Shoreline, Nadine's former paramilitary army, working with him, and later sells them the Tusk in exchange for a bomb that he plans to detonate on a train heading towards a nearby city. He goes insane at the end of the game after his plans of sparking a revolution become compromised by Frazer, Ross and Drake's efforts in stopping the train from reaching the city. After making one last stand in challenging Frazer and Ross to a melee, Asav gets his leg caught underneath the bomb that falls on him as the out-of-control train is headed towards a collapsed bridge. After Frazer and Ross leave, the train falls off into the valley below and explodes, killing Asav. Supporting characters Karl Sch√§fer Karl Sch√§fer is first introduced to when the player arrives in a remote town in the mountains of Tibet in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. He is voiced by Ren√© Auberjonois. At the time of his appearance, he has been living in the village for 70 years. During World War II, he had led an Ahnenerbe expedition to find the entrance of Shambhala. However, afraid of what the Nazis would do with the power found in the Cintamani Stone, Sch√§fer shot and killed all of the members of the expedition but himself.Nathan: Sch√§fer... killed them. When first met, Sch√§fer sends Drake to look for the Cintamani Stone, after explaining what the jewel can do. While he is gone, Lazareviƒá invades the village and kidnaps Sch√§fer, and uses him to tell him where the entrance to Shambala is. Sch√§fer dies of his wounds following his capture, begging Nathan and Elena to stop Lazareviƒá and Flynn and destroy the stone at all costs.Sch√§fer: This monastery hides the secret path to Shambhala. You must get the dagger back, find the secret path, and destroy the Stone before he gets his hands on it. Drake... you have to believe. Drake: Sch√§fer... Elena: Oh, Nate. Elena: We can't just leave him. His namesake is Ernst Sch√§fer, a German explorer who led the 1938-1939 German expedition to Tibet. Tenzin Tenzin is the leader of a remote Tibetan village in the Himalayas in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. He is voiced by Pema Dhondup, with Robin Atkin Downes responsible for his motion capture work. When Drake first wakes up, Tenzin leads him to Fisher and Sch√§fer. He is a Sherpa guide who leads Drake through the mountain passes surrounding the area. There, he helps Drake through various challenges that require more than one person to pass. Despite acting as a guide, Tenzin cannot speak any English. After returning, Drake and Tenzin find that the village has come under attack by Lazareviƒá. The developers felt that the sequences involving Tenzin leading Drake through the cave systems, and then seeing his village burning, would create an emotionally moving experience for the player. Tenzin has a daughter named Pema. He briefly appears in a photo in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, where Drake muses that he misses Tenzin. Jeff Wynis Jeff Wynis first appears in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. He is Elena's cameraman. He is voiced by Gregory Myhre. Wynis, along with Fisher, went to Nepal to prove that Lazareviƒá was alive, running into Nathan and Chloe. They then team up to find Shambala. after Nathan and Chloe investigate a Temple with clues as to where the location of Shambala is, they return to find Wynis injured by a bullet wound to the abdomen. Drake, escorted by Chloe and Fisher, tries to carry Wynis to safety, but they are caught and Lazareviƒá executes Wynis in front of Drake and Elena. Salim Salim appears in Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He is voiced by TJ Ramini. After Drake defeats the henchmen in the desert ghost town, Salim, a Bedouin sheikh, comes to him on horseback and helps him escape. After Drake was rescued, Salim tells him that the Atlantis of the Sands is a dangerous place and that Marlowe cannot be allowed to enter because of the evil within. Drake believes that she could use these powers to control others through fear, realising it was not treasure they were after. When Sullivan is rescued, Salim brings both of them to the open desert where the Atlantis of the Sands is located. Salim heads off and gets separated from Drake and Sullivan because of the heavy sandstorm. After Talbot is defeated and the Atlantis of the Sands collapse, Salim appears in time to save them. Jameson Jameson (first name unknown) appears in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. He is voiced and motion captured by Brandon Scott, and is the owner of a salvage company and Nate's boss. He attempts to persuade Nathan to join him in an illegal expedition in Malaysia, but Nathan politely turns him down. At the game's end, Jameson sells his company to Elena Fisher, who bought it from him with their plunder from Henry Avery's treasure. Evelyn Evelyn is a character that appears in flashback sequences in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. She is voiced and motion captured by Merle Dandridge. She is a celebrated historian and knew and worked with Cassandra Morgan, Nathan and Sam's mother. One night, she caught the two boys breaking into her house when they went to retrieve their mother's belongings, but decided to share with them what their mother found. Just as the police arrive at the scene, Evelyn tells the boys that she will buy them some time, but suddenly collapses. She was a heavy smoker and died from a lung disease, and the boys are associated with her death. Thus she was instrumental in Nathan and Samuel's eventual turn to a life of exploring and treasure hunting and them adopting the Drake surname, in honor of what she and their mother believed and the fact that they could not return to their previous lives. Various artifacts and letters scattered throughout her mansion reveal that she married a Japanese historian named Kenichiro Namba, and the two had a son named Edmund. Having grown obsessed with treasure hunting, she left Edmund to his father, and by the time of Kenichiro's death, Edmund had become resentful of his mother. The foreboding letters appear to be the primary driving force behind Nate balancing his relationship with treasure hunting. Cassie Drake Cassie Drake is the daughter of Nathan and Elena and Sam's niece. She was named after Cassandra Morgan, Nathan and Samuel's deceased mother and her paternal grandmother. She is voiced and motion captured by Kaitlyn Dever. She is playable in the epilogue chapter of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. While wandering around the house looking for her parents, she stumbles across the keys to Nathan's private wardrobe, where she discovers her parents' shady past before they catch her. Cassie demands to know the truth, and Nathan and Elena decide she is old enough to know, and tell her their story. Meenu Meenu is a character that appears in Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, voiced by Tierra Rolls. She is an Indian shopkeeper that first appears in the beginning in her shop where Chloe tries to buy a scarf, she briefly pickpockets a Ganesh Figurine from Chloe as she is giving her a tour but is caught and then helps her board an insurgent van by stalling a soldier. She later appears in the post credits scene of the game having pizza with Chloe, Nadine and Sam as she was promised by the former at the beginning of the game. Reception Matt Casamassina of IGN praised the characters of the Uncharted series for their growth and development, calling them strong characters. He also noted what he found as superior voice work and chemistry between the actors. He commended series writer Hennig for never having the characters say anything unnecessary that did not add to the relationships in the game. GameZone called the characters \\"endearing\\", \\"charming\\", and \\"unforgettable\\", and claimed that they had more personality than characters in most other video games. Ryan Clements of IGN praised the acting, claiming it brought a lifelike quality to the characters. He went on, \\"the sexual tension, detailed character expression, natural voice acting and charming dialogue make... cutscenes a supreme treat to watch.\\" Jeff Haynes said that the game was anchored by the strong characters. Ellie Gibson of Eurogamer said that the characters were easy to sympathize with because they were so realistic. Edge claimed the characters \\"sizzle with zip and pith\\", and praised the believable interactions between them. Ars Technica called the characters \\"oddly human\\" when discussing their realism. Ars Technica's Ben Kuchera also gave the voice acting high marks, claiming it set a new bar for video game voice acting. Johnny Minkley of Eurogamer claimed simply that players will care about the fate of all the characters in the series. Tom Cross of Gamasutra commented that the characters in the Uncharted series were some of the few in video games to portray human sexuality realistically. However, he complained that the roles were predictable when compared to other fictional movie and television roles. He criticized, \\"while Among Thieves creates interesting, fun characters, it still pigeon holes them into stock character story arcs: the good girl, the guy who will become good, and the bad girl, who is allowed to be sexually suggestive because the plot will ultimately remove her as a viable partner for the ultimately good guy.\\" Peadar Grogan of Edge commended the series for including strong female characters. Chris Roper of IGN stated that the characters of Uncharted are all unpredictable, and have a high level of character development. Andrew Reiner of Game Informer found this exploration of character emotion integral to the series story development. The character acting in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves received two nominations at the 13th Interactive Achievement Awards, for the acting of North as Drake and Black as Frazer. They were later nominated in 2011 in the VGA for voice acting. The nominees were North as Drake, Rose as Elena and Black as Chloe.

The temple is dedicated to Chamundeswari Devi, who is a form of Durga / Shakti.The temple is located in kootayanimoodu, Vellanadu panchayat, Thiruvananthapuram district, Kerala and is one of the oldest temples in the state.  Religious context  Chamunda Devi is considered as the wrathful form of Durga, but at the same time, the Goddess is kind to her true devotees. The term 'Chamunda' has been derived from two words, 'Chanda' and 'Munda'. As per the mythological legends, Durga made a goddess with her power, to slay the demons, Chanda and Munda. With her immense power, the Goddess killed the demons. Goddess Durga became happy with the slaughter and blessed the goddess that she would be known and worshipped as Chamunda. In Hinduism, Chamundi, Chamundeshwari and Charchika, is a fearsome aspect of Devi, the Hindu Divine Mother and one of the seven Matrikas (mother goddesses). She is also one of the chief Yoginis, a group of sixty-four or eighty-one Tantric goddesses, who are attendants of Durga. She is closely associated with Kali, another fierce aspect of Devi. She is sometimes identified with goddesses Parvati and Chandi as well. The goddess is often portrayed as haunting cremation grounds or fig trees, and is worshipped by ritual animal sacrifices along with offerings of wine. In the ancient times, human sacrifices were offered, too.

The single runway is 2,400 m, concrete surface. Its ICAO code is VV03. Kien An Airport is located in Ki·∫øn An District, H·∫£i Ph√≤ng, 10 km from Cat Bi Airport to the west. History First Indochina War The airfield was constructed during the French colonial period. The airfield was reportedly constructed over a 2 year period with large amounts of crushed rock being used to build foundations on the marshy land. The first French aircraft to land at Kien An apparently buckled the runway and the project was abandoned by the French. Vietnam War A-4 Skyhawks in October 1967 The base was put into service by the Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF). In July 1966 the National Photographic Interpretation Center reported that Kien An Airfield comprised \\"a 5900 ft x 150 ft, NE/SW, serviceable runway, resurfaced since October 1965. The airfield has a parallel taxiway with two end-connecting links, and a parking apron. An aircraft dispersal area contains seventeen revetted hardstands and eighteen hardstands recessed into the base of a hill at the southeast section of the airfield. Support facilities include one large probable maintenance building (where Hook helicopters are being assembled) and numerous support buildings. A probable ILS is located off the southwest end of the runway. Defenses in the immediate area include at least three eight-gun AAA sites. Aircraft at the airfield include four Hook helicopters without rotors in the process of being assembled, one probable Fresco (this is the first time a jet-type aircraft has been observed at this airfield), three Colt and one Hound.\\" On 14 April 1966 the VPAF deployed MiG-15/17s and at least 4 MiG-21s to Kien An and on 17 April these aircraft engaged United States' aircraft. Due to its proximity to Haiphong, the base was in the restricted area that US forces were prohibited from attacking, allowing the VPAF aircraft there to operate without the threat of air attack. The restricted area around Haiphong was reduced in March 1967 and the first US air attack on the base took place on 23 April 1967. On 19 November 1967 4 MiG-17s deployed from K√©p Air Base to Kien An intercepted a United States Navy strike package near the base, shooting down 2 F-4B Phantom IIs of VF-151. During Operation Linebacker II in December 1972 the base was repeatedly struck by US Navy aircraft causing extensive damage. On 21 December 1972 the AAA defenses at the base shot down A-6 Intruder BuNo 152946 of VA-75 as it made a night attack on the base, both crewmen were killed.

Her music style can be described as a combination of jazz, pop, electronic dance music, latin and world music. Biography The beginning Laroo was born in de Jordaan, Amsterdam, Netherlands as the eldest of four daughters. When she was six the family moved to Den Ilp, a nearby village. A year later she started with general music lessons and lessons on soprano recorder, later also alto recorder at the music school in Purmerend. In Den Ilp she started age 8 to play the cornet in fanfare orchestra . Laroo went in 1971 at age 11 to secondary school: het Zaanlands Lyceum, Zaandam. She switched from recorder to cello and took lessons for 3 years with cellist Olof Groesz, who became cellist of the Metropole Orchestra. When she was fifteen Saskia became interested in learning guitar and self-studied classical and folk music on the instrument for a year. A year later she was introduced to jazz music by the newly founded bigband on her high school and became member of the trumpet section. This bigband was conducted by pianist Jan Molenaar, who is owner of Molenaar Muziekuitgeverij. She got her first lessons in jazz improvisation with this band and heard for the first time bebop trumpet soloing by Peter Kuyt, then age 17 and also member of the bigband's trumpet section. After high school graduation in 1977, Saskia moved back to Amsterdam to study mathematics at the University of Amsterdam, but instead soon got involved in the city's music scene, and switched from cornet to trumpet. A year later she stopped her mathematics study and went to the Muziekpedagogische Academie Alkmaar where she studied for two years with main subject classical trumpet with trumpeter Jan Schut and secondary instruments classical piano and upright bass; then continuied her music studies with focus on improvised music at the Conservatory of Amsterdam, then named Sweelinck Conservatorium. She had trumpet lessons in improvised music with trumpeter Boy Raaijmaker, then member of the Willem Breuker Kollektief, continued her studies classical trumpet with trumpeter Dick Jonker, then member of the Amsterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, took jazz piano lessons and classical upright bass lessons with bassist Hans Krul. In 1982 she was released from the school but took up her studies a year later at the Muziekpedagogische Academie Hilversum, current part of the Conservatory of Amsterdam. There she studied jazz trumpet with trumpeter Ack van Rooyen, and continuied with jazz piano and classical upright bass lessons. In 1985, when she was 25, she graduated as a jazz trumpet music teacher after two years Later years In 1982 she made her first recordings that were released on LP with the band Fra Fra Sound and the reggae band PI Man & Memre Buku. In 1985 she played a solo on the song Don't you leave me Baby for Billy Preston's album: You can't keep a good man down. In 1994 she founded her own record label, Laroo Records. Her first CD album It's Like Jazz(1994), was co-produced by her and Rob Gaasterland, and was released in more than fifteen countries, amongst others in Japan, and speeded up the development of her international career. She toured with her own formations, amongst others with the Saskia Laroo Band, Jazzkia and Duo Laroo/Byrd to countries such as the USA; Canada; South Africa in 1996 and 2007; Brazil, China in 2004 and 2007 and she went for multiple tours to India. She played on international festivals, like the Montreux Jazzfestival in 2006 and again in 2007 after receiving the Montreux Jazz Award. She received in 2010 an Indian peace prize, the Karmaveer Puraskaar of the iCongo organisation in New Delhi, India. In 2013 she recorded a DVD Live in Zimbabwe with her eight piece Saskia Laroo Band at the Harare International Festival of the Artshttp://www.hifa.co.zw. This DVD was released March 28, 2014 and a limited edition on CD on October 15, both in Paradiso, Amsterdam. In 2019 she celebrates 40 years performing live on stage, 25 years her record label Laroo Records and 25 years the Saskia Laroo Band. A new album release Trumpets Around The World is scheduled in the Netherlands for November 1, 2019 in het Concertgebouw, Amsterdam and in the US November 29, 2019 at The Buttonwood Tree, Middletown, Connecticut.  Bands  Laroo's first performances started around 1978 with pop, fusion and dixieland bands. She was part of the all-female band Alice in Dixieland, played around 1981 in the Surinamese band Fra Fra Sound and was part of the free jazz workshop orchestra De Boventoon, she started working with American blues vocalist and saxophonist Rosa King, with Dutch saxophonist Hans Dulfer, and his daughter Candy Dulfer, with Edsel Juliet's group Saljuco, toured with Dutch Connection, an avant- garde project with American conductor/trumpeter/composer Butch Morris, and with Heleen Schuttevaer's all female jazzpop band Five Times A Lady. Later on in her career she performed with jazz greats such as Teddy Edwards and Ernie Andrews and performs currently with Warren Byrd's group The Byrdspeak Ensemble, David Chevan's group The Afrosemitic Experience.

It is one type of dualism, traditionally a type of substance dualism though more recently also sometimes a form of property dualism. Proponents Ren√© Descartes's illustration of dualism. Inputs are passed on by the sensory organs to the epiphysis in the brain and from there to the immaterial spirit. Interactionism was propounded by the French rationalist philosopher Ren√© Descartes (1596‚Äì1650), and continues to be associated with him. Descartes posited that the body, being physical matter, was characterized by spatial extension but not by thought and feeling, while the mind, being a separate substance, had no spatial extension but could think and feel. Nevertheless, he maintained that the two interacted with one another, suggesting that this interaction occurred in the pineal gland of the brain. In the 20th century, its most significant defenders have been the noted philosopher of science Karl Popper and the neurophysiologist John Carew Eccles. Popper in fact divided reality into three \\"worlds\\"‚Äîthe physical, the mental, and objective knowledge (outside the mind)‚Äîall of which interact,Three Worlds by Karl Popper - The Tanner Lecture on Human Values - Delivered by Karl Popper at The University of Michigan on April 7, 1978. and Eccles adopted this same \\"trialist\\" form of interactionism. Other notable recent philosophers to take an interactionist stance have been Richard Swinburne, John Foster, David Hodgson, and Wilfrid Sellars, in addition to the physicist Henry Stapp. In his 1996 book The Conscious Mind, David Chalmers questioned interactionism. In 2002 he listed it along with epiphenomenalism and what he calls \\"Type-F Monism\\" as a position worth examining. Rather than invoking two distinct substances, he defines interactionism as the view that \\"microphysics is not causally closed, and that phenomenal properties play a causal role in affecting the physical world.\\" (See property dualism.) He argues the most plausible place for consciousness to impact physics is the collapse of the wave function in quantum mechanics. The New Catholic Encyclopedia argues that a non-physical mind and mind-body interaction follow necessarily from the Catholic doctrines of the soul and free will.Maher, Michael (1909) \\"The Law of Conservation of Energy\\", Catholic Encyclopedia, vol. 5, pp. 422 ff, http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05422a.htm.  Objections  Problem of causal interaction One objection often posed to interactionism is the problem of causal interaction ‚Äì how the two different substances the theory posits, the mental and the physical, can exert an impact on one another. Descartes' theory that interaction between the mind and the physical world occurred in the pineal gland was seen as inadequate by a number of philosophers in his era, who offered alternate views: Nicholas Malebranche suggested occasionalism, according to which mind and body appear to interact but are in fact moved separately by God, while Gottfried Leibniz argued in The Monadology that mind and body are in a pre-established harmony. On the other hand, Baruch Spinoza rejected Descartes' dualism and proposed that mind and matter were in fact properties of a single substance, thereby prefiguring the modern perspective of neutral monism. Today the problem of causal interaction is frequently viewed as a conclusive argument against interactionism. On the other hand, it has been suggested that given many disciplines deal with things they do not entirely understand, dualists not entirely understanding the mechanism of mind-body interaction need not be seen as definitive refutation. The idea that causation necessarily depends on push-pull mechanisms (which would not be possible for a substance that did not occupy space) is also arguably based on obsolete conceptions of physics. The problem of mental causation is also discussed in the context of other positions on the mind-body problem, such as property dualism and anomalous monism. Compatibility with the conservation of energy A more recent related objection is the argument from physics, which argues that a mental substance impacting the physical world would contradict principles of physics. In particular, if some external source of energy is responsible for the interactions, it would violate the law of conservation of energy.Lycan, William (1996) \\"Philosophy of Mind\\" in The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy, ed. Nicholas Bunnin and E. P. Tsui-James, Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. Two main responses to this have been to suggest the mind influences the distribution but not the quantity of energy in the brain and to deny that the brain is a causally closed system in which conservation of energy would apply.  Causal closure  Taking the argument a step further, it has been argued that because physics fully accounts for the causes of all physical movements, there can be no place for a non-physical mind to play a role. The principle, in slightly different iterations, has variously been called causal closure, completeness of the physical, physical closure, and physical comprehensiveness. This has been the foremost argument against interactionism in contemporary philosophy. Some philosophers have suggested the influence of the mind on the body could be reconciled with deterministic physical laws by proposing the mind's impacts instead take place at points of quantum indeterminacy. Karl Popper and John Eccles, as well as the physicist Henry Stapp, have theorized that such indeterminacy may apply at the macroscopic scale. (See quantum mind.) However, Max Tegmark has argued that classical and quantum calculations show that quantum decoherence effects do not play a role in brain activity. David Chalmers has noted (without necessarily endorsing) a second possibility within quantum mechanics, that consciousness' causal role is to collapse the wave function as per the Von Neumann-Wigner interpretation of quantum mechanics. He acknowledges this is at odds with the interpretations of quantum mechanics held by most physicists, but notes, \\"There is some irony in the fact that philosophers reject interactionism on largely physical grounds (it is incompatible with physical theory), while physicists reject an interactionist interpretation of quantum mechanics on largely philosophical grounds (it is dualistic). Taken conjointly, these reasons carry little force...\\". There remains a literature in philosophy and science, albeit a much-contested one, that asserts evidence for emergence in various domains, which would undermine the principle of causal closure. (See emergentism.) Another option that has been suggested is that the interaction may involve dark energy, dark matter or some other currently unknown scientific process.Robinson, H. (2003) \\"Dualism\\", in The Blackwell Guide to Philosophy of Mind, ed. S. Stich and T. Warfield, Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 85-101. Another possible resolution is akin to parallelism‚ÄîEugene Mills holds that behavioral events are causally overdetermined, and can be explained by either physical or mental causes alone. An overdetermined event is fully accounted for by multiple causes at once. However, J. J. C. Smart and Paul Churchland have argued that if physical phenomena fully determine behavioral events, then by Occam's razor a non- physical mind is unnecessary. Andrew Melnyk argues that overdetermination would require an \\"intolerable coincidence.\\" While causal closure remains a key obstacle for interactionism, it is not relevant to all forms of dualism; epiphenomenalism and parallelism are unaffected as they do not posit that the mind affects the body. Relationship to other positions Four varieties of dualist causal interaction. The arrows indicate the direction of causations. Mental and physical states are shown in red and blue, respectively. Interactionism can be distinguished from competing dualist theories of causation, including epiphenomenalism (which admits causation, but views causation as unidirectional rather than bidirectional), and parallelism (which denies causation, while seeking to explain the semblance of causation by other means such as pre-established harmony or occasionalism). In The Conscious Mind, David Chalmers argued that regardless of the mechanism by which the mental might impact the physical if interactionism were true, there was a deeper conceptual issue: the chosen mechanism could always be separated from its phenomenal component, leading to simply a new form of epiphenomenalism. Later, he suggested that while the causal component could be separated, interactionism was like \\"type-F monism\\" (Russellian monism, panpsychism, and panprotopsychism) in that it gave entities externally characterized by physical relationships the additional intrinsic feature of conscious properties.

When Jason came up with the idea to do a stylized version of a dollar bill with altered and hidden imagery it took a bit of \\"selling\\" to the record label. Stephen loved the idea and sat down with Jason to help expand the idea and bring his vision to life. For the main image on the cover, Jason wanted to feature the band's faces carved over the sculpture of Mount Rushmore with a radio antenna on the top of the mountain spreading the AM Conspiracy message. The photo would appear as part of the engraving on an altered one dollar bill (to symbolize their first album). Stephen used some of the stylized filigrees that appear on the one dollar bill and played into the conspiracy theories regarding hidden imagery that are mixed into the engravings on the original currency design. Stephen and Jason worked together to carry the conspiracy theory imagery throughout the rest of the album artwork including the layout of Washington DC, UFO and alien implants, the Paul McCartney death hoax, the JFK magic bullet theory, the Lincoln assassination, and the faked lunar landing. Gong made a late night call to Stephen immediately after seeing the first draft of the album cover. He was blown away that Stephen was able to take the vision exactly as it appeared in his head several steps further.\\"AM Conspiracy ‚Äì Debut Album Cover\\" f3studios.com.
