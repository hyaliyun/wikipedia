He has created material for, and been involved in, a range of subgenres, including zombie movies (Return of the Living Dead III), classic Creature Features (Amphibious), and supernatural thrillers (Hellgate). Biography John Penney is the son of science fiction writer Raylyn Moore (n√©e Crabbe) and stepson of writer Ward Moore. Ray Bradbury was an old roommate of Ward Moore, and one of the first people to give Penney writing advice when he was a young man. Penny attended UCLA where he studied film and received a degree in English. Penney's first literary agent was H.N. Swanson, the man who represented F. Scott Fitzgerald, Raymond Chandler, William Faulkner and many other giants of 20th century literature. Career Penney started his career as a film editor, with his first job being an assistant editor on The Dorm That Dripped Blood, a film that became embroiled in the infamous Video Nasties case, after it was banned in the UK.Video nasty He went on to work on several independent horror productions, including The Power (1984), as well as Dan O'Bannon's The Return of the Living Dead. It was shortly after this that Penney wrote the screenplay for The Kindred (1987), the process of which made him want to become a full- time writer.http://www.horrorchannel.co.uk/articles.php?feature=8912&category;=5 It was on The Kindred that Penney worked with Psycho screenwriter Joseph Stefano. Afterwards he joined the Screenwriting Guild and sold a script to Warner Brothers. This led to working on several projects within the studio system which did not come to fruition. The independent filmmaker Brian Yuzna was in the process of developing a sequel to The Return of the Living Dead and Penney pitched and idea which he describes as \\"Romeo and Juliet on the run\\".Fangoria Issue #327 October 2013 Yuzna was impressed and they began developing the script, with Penney bringing beat sheets to Yuzna's office every day. The film was released through Trimark Pictures and went on to become a cult classic. The central theme of zombie as main character was new at the time, and has since been utilized by such contemporary films as Warm Bodies (2013) and Life After Beth (2014). During the 1990s and early 2000s, as well as his horror genre work, Penney wrote for television and mainstream movies. In addition to his screenplays, Penney has written short stories that have won him an award from the Adelphi Academy in New York, and have been published in the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. Zyzzyx Road became part of a media frenzy when a misunderstood screening (held for obligatory contractual purposes) was filed as box office, which caused the film press to report it as the \\"lowest grossing film of all time\\" In 2011 Penney wrote and directed the supernatural thriller Hellgate. The film was shot in Thailand and stars Hurt and Cary Elwes. It was awarded the 2011 Best Film at the Bram Stoker International Film Festival in England as well as winning Best Horror Film at the 2011 Fantasy Horror Awards in Italy. Penney's first novel, Truck Stop, was released in 2012. An interview with Penney was published in the October 2013 issue of Fangoria Magazine. The piece, written by Colin McCracken, was a celebration of the 20th Anniversary of Return of the Living Dead III.

Here a licence was confirmed and upheld where two former co-habitees had fallen out and separated; removing from the remaining licensee, in arrears, the extra time to remain afforded by the old Rent Act 1977 type tenancies which he hoped to benefit from. Facts Mikeover Ltd had leased 179 Southgate Rd, London, N1, and then let it out to Mr Brady and Miss Guile. They each signed separate but identical ‚Äòlicence‚Äô agreements allowing them to share for six months for ¬£86.66 a month. After the sixth months expired they were allowed to remain on the same terms. Miss Guile moved out early 1986, telling Mr Ferster, the Mikeover Ltd director, in April 1986. Mr Brady offered to continue to pay ¬£173.32 in rent. Mr Ferster replied ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt accept it. I‚Äôll hold you responsible for your share only.‚Äô But Mr Brady still fell into arrears for his half, and Mikeover Ltd tried to remove him in early 1987. He claimed he had a lease of the flat to get Rent Act protection.HTML Version of Judgment County Court held they had only licences. Judgment Slade LJ held they had only licences. There was exclusive possession in common with the other occupier, but there was no unity of interest, and no joint tenancy, and the limitation on payments to their own shares was pivotal. This meant the arrangements were incapable of creating a joint tenancy because the obligations were not joint. There was no sham. It was established that there must be the four unities present, of possession, interest, title and time, and there was no unity of interest because there was only a several obligation for payment of the rent. That requires the existence of ‚Äòjoint rights and joint obligations‚Äô. Following devoutly the likewise 1989 case of Stribling, Slade LJ added: > Parker LJ with whose judgment Fox LJ and Sir Denys Buckley agreed, said: > :\\"The three licences were in substance and reality just what they purported > to be. The right, specifically given under each of termination on 28 days' > notice by either side, and the provision whereby each was responsible only > for a specific sum which was in fact one third of the total required by the > landlord, are wholly inconsistent with a joint tenancy.\\" The entire > inconsistency with a joint tenancy of a provision rendering each licensee > responsible only for one third of the total required by the landlord was, as > we read Stribling v Wickham, part of the essential reasoning which led this > court to its final decision.

Facts Mr Nathan owned 263-265 Walworth Rd, Southwark, London before 1930, and the London County Council the road. It planned to widen it, encroaching on a strip of land separating his shop from the road. The LCC bought the freehold of the strip, but agreed he could use it until the project went ahead, and he would pay ¬£30 a year in rent ‚Äòuntil the strip of land is needed for road-widening‚Äô. But by 1988 the road had not been widened and the London Residuary Body (LRB), successor of the LCC held it. Prudential Assurance Ltd now held numbers 263-265. LRB pleaded that it could end Prudential's right to use its strip (whereby Prudential paid ¬£30 a year); arguing either the lease it granted in 1930 was invalid or that if the court were to uphold some novel form of limitless tenancy it should be deemed capable of ending (termination) on a year's notice either way. Prudential plead it had a valid limitless tenancy/lease and strictly (outside of say compulsory purchase for wider development) the LRB could only get possession if needed to widen the road. Prudential pointed to the estimated loss/gain of trade from its units ¬£10,000 a year if customers could not cross it. This was the amount of money which LRB might be able to charge it so as to continue to operate its adjoining shop, having a ransom strip if the lease was found to be completely void. Prudential stressed if Nathan had known he would need to pay a market rate access charge to continue to enjoy the pavement/front yard he would never had sold it to the local authority. Prudential begged the court to amend the common law rules rather than rely on the possibility the Law Commission may one day amend it to deal with this unsatisfactory outcome (the voidness of leases not expiring by the effluxion of time). Millett J found in favour of Prudential. LRB used the leapfrog procedure to go directly to the House of Lords, as it wished to challenge the Court of Appeal cases, In re Midland Railway Co‚Äôs Agreement and Ashburn Anstalt v Arnold. Judgment The Court, unanimously, led by Lord Templeman held the tenancy was too uncertain to be effective, and thus had not created a binding lease. Lord Browne- Wilkinson agreed but noted that any successor in title for Mr Nathan would no longer automatically have land that faced the road, which is of commercial importance on such a main road. Nothing could be more unsatisfactory. The Law Commission should look to amend the law.

The ELM327 command protocol is one of the most popular PC-to-OBD interface standards and is also implemented by other vendors. The original ELM327 is implemented on the PIC18F2480 microcontroller from Microchip Technology. ELM327 is one of a family of OBD translators from ELM Electronics. Other variants implement only a subset of the OBD protocols.  Uses  The ELM327 abstracts the low-level protocol and presents a simple interface that can be called via a UART, typically by a hand-held diagnostic tool or a computer program connected by USB, RS-232, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. New applications include smartphones. There are a large number of programs available that connect to the ELM327. The function of such software may include: * Supplementary vehicle instrumentation * Reporting of error codes * Clearing error codes ELM327 Functions: *Read diagnostic trouble codes, both generic and manufacturer-specific. *Clear some trouble codes and turn off the MIL (\\"Malfunction Indicator Light\\", more commonly known as the \\"Check Engine Light\\") *Display current sensor data *Engine RPM *Calculated Load Value *Coolant Temperature *Fuel System Status *Vehicle Speed *Short Term Fuel Trim *Long Term Fuel Trim *Intake Manifold Pressure *Timing Advance *Intake Air Temperature *Air Flow Rate *Absolute Throttle Position *Oxygen sensor voltages/associated short term fuel trims *Fuel System status *Fuel Pressure  Protocols supported by ELM327  The protocols supported by ELM327 are: *SAE J1850 PWM (41.6 kbit/s) *SAE J1850 VPW (10.4 kbit/s) *ISO 9141-2 (5 baud init, 10.4 kbit/s) *ISO 14230-4 KWP (5 baud init, 10.4 kbit/s) *ISO 14230-4 KWP (fast init, 10.4 kbit/s) *ISO 15765-4 CAN (11 bit ID, 500 kbit/s) *ISO 15765-4 CAN (29 bit ID, 500 kbit/s) *ISO 15765-4 CAN (11 bit ID, 250 kbit/s) *ISO 15765-4 CAN (29 bit ID, 250 kbit/s) *SAE J1939 (250kbit/s) *SAE J1939 (500kbit/s)  ELM327 command set  The ELM327 command set is similar to the Hayes AT commands.  Other versions  Typical cheap ELM327 copy without label on the controller The ELM327 is a PIC microcontroller that has been customized with ELM Electronics' proprietary code that implements the testing protocols. When ELM Electronics sold version 1.0 of its ELM327, it did not enable the copy protection feature of the PIC microcontroller. Consequently, anyone could buy a genuine ELM327, and read ELM's proprietary binary microcontroller software using a device programmer. With this software, pirates could trivially produce ELM327 clones by purchasing the same microcontroller chips and programming them with the copied code. ELM327 copies were widely sold in devices claiming to contain an ELM327 device, and problems have been reported with the copies. The problems reflect bugs that were present in ELM's version 1.0 microcode; those making the clones may continue to sell the old version. Although these copies may contain the ELM327 v1.0 code, they may falsely report the version number as the current version provided by the genuine ELM327, and in some cases report an as-yet non- existent version. Released software versions for the ELM327 are 1.0, 1.0a, 1.1, 1.2, 1.2a, 1.3, 1.3a, 1.4, 1.4b, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 only.

Contents The Act's aim is to protect tenants from being ejected from their homes by landlords, unless there has been a court order. Section 3 states that nobody can be forcibly evicted without a court order. The purpose of this section was to prevent aggressive landlords becoming violent. Section 3A states that there are a number of exclusions. These are primarily when a landlord actually resides in the same property as the tenant, or the accommodation falls within the definition of a hostel or hotel. Section 5 states that everyone, whether classified as having a lease or a licence, is required to be given four weeks notice before they are evicted. Any \\"notice to quit\\" has no effect before this time. Failure to respect the act Police have frequently failed to intervene when tenants were forceably removed from their homes without a court order or when tenants' property was removed from their homes and locks changed without a court order. Shelter maintain that in 2016 nearly 50,000 tenants had their belongings removed, and the locks changed by landlords. Over 200,000 tenants were harassed by their landlord and some 600,000 had their landlord enter their home without permission.

There was a clear conflict of interest here, importing a necessity to show that reasonable precautions had been taken to get the best price. The Board advised that although the respondent was free to sell to a company in which he was interested, he had failed to demonstrate he had taken reasonable care in the conduct of the sale.

It affirmed the proposition that a lender (and its agents or receivers) are not required to incur expenses that would likely delay a sale beyond the normal period of marketing. Facts In 1996, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) appointed receivers over 33 properties mortgaged by Silven Properties to it, and proceeded to sell them off. The receivers explored planning and letting out the properties, but decided to sell them straight away. Silven alleged that RBS's receivers were under a duty to maximise the value by getting planning permission for development and letting out of vacant properties. In the Chancery Division, Patten J held that neither the mortgagee nor receiver were required to incur expenses that would likely delay a sale beyond the normal period of marketing. This was supported by the cases of Cuckmere Brick Co v Mutual Finance, Downsview Nominees Ltd v First City Corporation Ltd, and Medforth v Blake. Judgment Lightman J held that RBS had not breached its duty. A duty is owed in equity (rather than tort) but it was not breached on the facts. * The mortgagee is entitled to sell the mortgaged property as it is, but is under no obligation to improve it or increase its value.Silven, par. 16 * The mortgagee is free (in his own interest as well as that of the mortgagor) to investigate whether and how he can \\"unlock\\" the potential for an increase in value of the property mortgaged, but he is likewise free at any time to halt his efforts and proceed instead immediately with a sale.Silven, par. 17 * If the mortgagor requires protection in any of these respects, whether by imposing further duties on the mortgagee or limitations on his rights and powers, he must insist upon them when the bargain is made and upon the inclusion of protective provisions in the mortgage. The one method available to the mortgagor to prevent the mortgagee from exercising his rights is to redeem the mortgage.Silven, par. 18 Impact Silven's reasoning was also held to apply to other forms of mortgages in Den Norske Bank ASA v Acemex Management Company Ltd. which was handed down several days later.

After his return to Albania, he was involved in anti-Zogist and anti-Italian activities; in 1935 he participated in the Fier rebellion against King Zog and shortly after found himself arrested by the authorities. During 1937‚Äì39 Spiro Koleka travelled extensively in Italy while taking an active part in the resistance against the Italian occupation of Albania. Upon the Italian occupation (7 April 1939) he fled to Yugoslavia, but returned to Albania in December 1939. During 1940‚Äì41 he began cooperating with the communist resistance underground while at the same time co-founding and running the Mani and Koleka Engineering Company.

In the capacity of Deputy Prime Minister, Koleka presented in 1952 the very first Five Year Plan for the economy. In 1966, he was again appointed chairman of the State Planning Commission.

Since before anyone can remember, the beaches of \\"El Lorito\\", \\"El Techito\\" and \\"La Pe√±a Larga\\" have provided food sources to populate Pacasmayo. With the available food from the sea and the forests in the arid mountains (close to the river Jequetepeque) which provides carob trees (or locust beans), wool, and diverse species of animals; Pacasmayo (or Pacasca Mayo in Quechuan) was chosen as a settling place for small tribal groups. By order of Virrey Teodoro de Croix in the year 1775, the Spanish conquistadors founded Pacasmayo. Since that time it became an important landing for the Spanish crown. The year of 1871 began the construction of the Pacasmayo dock or \\"muelle de Pacasmayo\\" and the train Pacasmayo-Chilete, which turned into an important Peruvian coastal port. This work of engineering began the golden age of Pacasmayo which lasted until 1967, the year when the railway stopped running. Since that time, the commercial activity has decreased to the point where now the dock, just as the railway station, are historic monuments. They are evidence of a glorious past that brought with it an economic boom to the city. The company ‚ÄúCementos Pacasmayo SA‚Äù (Pacasmayo Concrete Inc.), which began in 1959, quickly became the new axis upon which the economy of the city developed. Its presence promoted the development of many economic services such as businesses that transport heavy loads, banks, and commercial stores. All depended on this central industry. Since the end of the 20th century, the breakwater area, El Faro (The Lighthouse), dominated as the ‚Äúlargest, most navigable wave in the world‚Äù and has gained popularity among water-sport fans. At that beach, one can practice surfing, windsurfing, kitesurfing, and paddle-boarding which promotes the growth of foreign visitors who arrive from diverse parts of the world to enjoy these waves.

It returned one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons, elected by the first past the post voting system. Vacancy Sir Walter Menzies had been Liberal MP for South Lanarkshire since 1906 until he died on 26 October 1913. He had died after a long illness, so the calling of a by-election was not unexpected. Previous result Menzies Candidates *Forty-three-year-old George Morton was selected to defend the seat for the Liberals. He was born in the constituency in the village of Auchengray where his father owned a farm. He was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh, and after training as a lawyer was admitted to the Scottish Bar in 1895. In 1911 he became an Advocate- Depute. *William Watson was a 40-year-old Advocate. Watson was the son of William Watson, Baron Watson, and was educated at Winchester and Jesus College, Cambridge, graduating with a third class degree in law in 1895. He was admitted as an advocate in 1899. *The Labour Party fielded a candidate in the constituency for the first time in Thomas Gibb, a Miner's check-weighman from Cleland, North Lanarkshire. Back in August 1913, the Lanarkshire Miners‚Äô Union decided to select a candidate to contest a future by-election. Unlike most miners unions at the time, the Lanarkshire Union was dominated by Socialists who were not sympathetic to the Liberal Party. A ballot of their members was held and Gibb beat three other candidates to secure the nomination. The Labour Party nationally was attempting to balance the wishes of their partners in parliament, the Liberal Party, with the wishes of Constituency Labour Parties seeking to field candidates in by-elections. No decision had been taken by the Labour Party National Executive when Gibb stated \\"First and foremost, I am a Socialist. If I cannot win South Lanark as Socialist\\" then I won‚Äôt win it at all.\\"Justice, 23 August 1913, page 6 When it became clear in early November that Gibb would stand with the backing of the Scottish Miners‚Äô Federation, the Labour Party decided to endorse him as their candidate. Campaign Polling Day was arranged for 12 December 1913, 47 days after the death of Menzies. This allowed for an unusually long campaign. Watson's task was to become the first Unionist to win here since 1900. Although adopted as the official Labour Party candidate, Gibb's campaign billed him as the \\"Socialist and Labour\\" candidate.Justice, 23 August 1913, page 6 He was also to enjoy the active support of local British Socialist Party branches. He stated his intention to focus his campaign on the issue of poverty. The Liberal Government's National Insurance Act 1911 became an issue in the campaign. The measures of the act were now being implemented with 2.3 million people insured under the scheme for unemployment benefit and almost 15 million insured for sickness benefit. The Unionists had opposed the measure and continued to attack it at by-elections. The Labour Party had given support to the policy when it was introduced but in a number of by-elections since, their candidates had spoken out against it. Tom Gibb was no exception, stating \\"I am no believer in policy of social reform paid for out of the earnings of the workers, such as we have seen illustrated in the Insurance Act. The reform that does not increase the purchasing-power of the workers by transferring to them some of the wealth previously enjoyed by the idle rich is not, in my opinion, a reform. If I believed in reforms of that nature, I would not be a Socialist.\\"Justice, 23 August 1913, page 6 O'Connor Although there were not many Irish voters in the constituency, the Liberal campaign was supported by a visit from T. P. O'Connor the Irish Nationalist MP from Liverpool. The Irish Nationalists were key supporters of the Liberal Government due to the 3rd Irish Home Rule Bill. The issue of Scottish Home Rule entered the campaign through the intervention of the Young Scots. The Liberal Government had introduced a Scottish Home Rule Bill that had passed its second reading in May 1913, despite Unionist opposition. The Young Scots were critical of Gibb's lack of support for the policy. Smillie Leading Labour Party figure, Robert Smillie speaking during the campaign in support of Gibb said any miner who did not vote Labour was a traitor to his class and he threatened those miners who did would be black-legged. Countering for the Liberal campaign, J.M. Robertson argued that anyone voting for Gibb would be the traitor; He argued that Gibb had no chance of success and that any vote for him risked letting in the anti- democratic Tory which would damage the interests of the workers. The Labour Party campaign believed that Gibb could win the election; They hoped that he could secure the votes of the constituency's 3,000 miners as a minimum and with the support of the railwaymen, farm servants and other workmen, he would romp home.Justice, 1 November 1913, page 6 Result The Unionist candidate gained the seat, despite seeing his vote share drop. The Liberals had been denied the seat by the intervention of the Labour candidate. The Labour poll represented barely half the number of miners voters in the constituency and significantly down on their expectations; Lloyd George David Lloyd George the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in a letter to Morton said he \\"regretted the division in the progressive ranks of the electors in the constituency and the only satisfaction reserved for the Labour competitor was that he would possibly succeed in manoeuvering a Liberal constituency into the Tory lobby to vote for land monopoly in Great Britain and to support civil war in Ireland.\\" Aftermath A General Election was due to take place by the end of 1915. By the summer of 1914, the following candidates had been adopted to contest that election. *Unionist Party: William Watson Due to the outbreak of war, the election never took place. For the 1918 elections the constituency was abolished and Watson decided to retire from the House of Commons. Neither Morton nor Gibb stood for parliament again.

He is the creator and co-writer of the TV Series \\"Sport Crime\\". He has played for Italy, Switzerland, and Hungary. He has also played Australian rules football and ice hockey. He has appeared on Eurosport's programs, including Total Rugby. He created and anchored a web show sports program called the Oval Bin, which he hosted with Daniela Scalia.  Television career  Tramontin was on television mostly as a guest, but in 1996 he began studying acting and television writing at the Antenna Cinema school. He worked a year at Canale 5, then at Telepi√π-Sky as a writer and journalist for five years. Although still active in rugby, his television production work had yet to be related to his sport activities. In 2004, Tramontin moved to the newly formed network SportItalia, which partnered with Eurosport. There, he provided commentary on rugby matches, with Pierpaolo Pedroni in the first year, and afterwards with Gianluca Veneziano. He anchored the International Rugby Board (IRB)'s official magazine program, Total Rugby, with Daniela Scalia. The show had been broadcast in over a hundred countries without any anchors, but Tramontin and Scalia changed the format making it into a \\"docu-talk\\". Between 2004-2012, Tramontin averaged five hours of sports commentary a week for Eurosport. The topics featured include: Rugby League State of Origin, National Rugby League, Australian Football League, Cricket Champions League, Field Hockey Euro League, weightlifting, StrongMan, Gaelic Sports and the Spengler Cup ice hockey tournament, the last of which he considers one of the best sports events ever. In 2006, Tramontin became a regular guest on the Swiss National TV RSI lunch-time talk show Mezzogiorno in punto, which was anchored by Fabrizio Casati. In 2007, the show changed its name to Buon Pomeriggio and changed anchors to Sandy Altermatt. Tramontin was the \\"multifaceted talker of sports, music and life in general.\\" He participated in Sport Non Stop, a six-hour Sunday sports show led by Stefano Ferrando. He commentated on the finals for the 2007 and 2011 Rugby Union World Cup for Swiss National TV. Since 2010 he collaborates with Australian radio broadcaster SBS In 2011, Tramontin created and hosted a show called the Oval Bin. It was originally intended to be a television program, but turned into a shortened web show at the last moment for reasons not revealed. Oval Bin was co-anchored by Daniela Scalia and Gianluca Veneziano. In February 2013, Tramontin and Scalia hosted ESP Hockey, a weekly ice hockey magazine show, at Espansione TV The show has focused on the Suisse NLA ice hockey championship, but he has occasionally thrown in references to rugby, Australian football, water polo and other team sports.  Sport Crime  Luca Tramontin in a waterpolo scene During 2013 Luca Tramontin and Daniela Scalia invented and registered a new TV Series called Sport Crime. They kept it hidden until the trailer's shooting took them to Polcenigo (PN), Rovigo (with Rugby Rovigo Delta), Rijeka (with Primorje) and London (at Marylebone Cricket Club Academy of Lord's Cricket Ground). Sport Crime is the first ever series based on real sport, it tells the story of \\"Seam Agency\\", based in Lugano and ready to intervene when an alleged crime or infraction endangers a team, a sport venue or an athlete. Any episode is based on a different sport. Daniela Scalia acts as main character, while Tramontin declares to be still undecided on the matter. The trailer gave evidence that all actors are active or former athletes that often try or re-enact the facts risking their bodies in real actions like smashing tackles, high velocity crashes and bodychecks. Through Sport Crime is a fictional work designed for TV consumption, most of the plots come from the long experience of the authors as sportsmen, coaches, TV commentators, presenters or analysts. The first episode of Sport Crime has been extensively rehearsed in Rijeka (Fiume) e Opatija (Abbazia), with Tramontin e Scalia in most of the real location of the effective shooting that Tramontin gave for \\"nearly imminent\\" in a long interview in the Novi List. The plot runs around the alleged kidnapping of a waterpolo star shortly before Primorje has to face the Champions League semifinals. Tramontin also revealed the surprising connection he has with the Kvarnar area and with Croatian language and culture. On 4 April 2016, at Cannes Mip Festival, Tramontin and Scalia revealed that the TV movie \\"The Legacy Run\\", introducing Sport Crime themes, atmosphere and characters, had been produced and edited. Curiously, no shooting had been done in Italy but only in Switzerland and Croatia with extensive media coverage on national TVs, radio, magazines and newspapers. December 4, 2016, \\"The Legacy Run\\" had its world premier at Swiss national tv reaching share numbers close to the historic \\"Sunday Sport Show /Domenica Sportiva\\". The whole movie had an extremely positive reception.  Sports career  right Tramontin joined 1st division club Rugby Casale in 1985. He played for seven seasons as a second rower. He had a short stint with Occhiali Vogue Belluno, which had reached Serie A, but he returned to Casale after some disciplinary issues. In the 1989 off season, he traveled to play in the New England Rugby Union Cup in Glen Innes, New South Wales, Australia, where he got in touch also with Cricket, Rugby League and Aussie Rules. Then coach Colin Price advised Luca to train twice a week with the local rugby league team in order to improve his deficitary ball handling. In reflecting on his Australian visit, Tramontin said, \\"those awkward hours in the park opened up my mind forever\\" as he would later leave the Rugby Union to play the games he learned down under. In the 1990 off season, after getting the 1st degree, he biked through Thailand and Malaysia for two and a half months, and returned late and underweight to the Casale summer camp. As a result, he had a low rate season where he was relegated to the bench. From 1992-2006, he played on various clubs in Piacenza, Viadana, Brescia, New York City, and three different clubs in Milano. In 2006, Tramontin moved to Bellinzona, Switzerland, where he joined the local rugby club at Ticino at the age of 41, and joined the Hungarian national team, which he qualified through ancestry. He also fulfilled his dream of playing ice hockey, albeit at a very low level; this was documented on his television show, Oval Bin. He joined a rugby club in Lugano and contributed as a starter. He joined the Swiss team for two weekends in Lausanne under Toulosan coach Patrice Philippe. Being over 40 and having an official cap with Hungary, there were hopes that he would be permitted to join. In 2008, Tramontin left rugby union to play Australian rules football (abbreviated as Aussie Rules or Orules) in the summer, and amateur ice hockey in the winter. He participated on AFL Italia for nine caps and was the captain when the national team participated in the 2009 European Cup held in Samobor, Croatia. For the 2010 European Cup, he represented AFL Switzerland as the team made its debut; he served as the team's coach. In 2011, Tramontin was asked to help the Hungarian national rugby team, the Magyar Bulls, who made its first appearance in international competition. He played for the team against the Czech Republic in a match in Kecskem√©t, Hungary. He later decided the commitment was too high as he had been playing for AFL Switzerland and was a television commentator. He has been playing Australian Rules football for the Lugano Bankers, and amateur ice hockey during their off season.  Orules, Rugby/Aussie Rules for disabled  Tramontin started and invented a new formula for disabled people to play full contact oval ball. It has been well documented on TV and media in order to expand the code.http://www.oruleslugano.ch/#!disabili/c1nnd For serious mental and perceptive diseases the game consists in a code half way between rugby and Australian Football, while for medium degree of disability the teams created by Tramontin adopt the Orules/Australian Football rules except for number of players and length of the periods.  Other disabled sports  Tramontin is very close to any form of team sport for disabled people, both organizing or trying to practice himself. right  Ice Hockey  Luca's flirt with Hockey started 3 years before his rugby as a kid supporter of Alleghe Hockey Club, but due to distant ice rinks, parent's split and heavy rugby commitments he never embraced it as a player before 2006. The \\"Genitori\\" GDT Hockey club Bellinzona started in 2006, at amateur level, with 5-6 matches for year, Luca claims to have missed no more than 4 training per year so far, mixing it well with other sport and work commitments. His son Nico plays in the same club as a defensive man. In October 2012 the \\"Genitori\\" organized a tour to Alleghe and Auronzo to have Luca playing against the \\"Old Timers\\", the players he supported as a kid. The event featured the former NHLer Steve McKenna and has been covered by the magazine \\"Oval Bin\\". 2014 Luca played and trained for all the pre-season with Rivera Vikings (Ticino local premiership) featuring also in some games as a defensive and forechecking winger. Eventually he had to leave again, due to the Cannes Film Festival and the imminent start of Sport Crime shooting. Since his move to Switzerland Tramontin co-operates with various Ice-Hockey teams for crossover trainings, both amateur and professional like HC Lugano. He is the father of Novizi's HC Lugano defender Nico.  Football (soccer)  June 2019, national Swiss TV and several media reported that the \\"Sport Crime\\" duo Daniela Scalia and Luca Tramontin have been working since September 2018 coaching FC Lugano Settore Giovanile with techniques and drills partly custom created and partly from rugby. The unprecedented protocol is said immensely useful by neo president and owner Leonid Novoselskyi and coaches of the professional team. 393x393px  Other Sports  WATERPOLO: in his first book Luca tells about some months of waterpolo played in 1986 during a long suspension from rugby for contractual issues. Pictures and words describe a very comical and dangerous debut in the Serie D match Trieste - Belluno. He claim to be no expert, therefore he refuses to embrace the \\"Water Football\\" as one of his commented sports.  Sports History  Tramontin often is called for talking about sports history at universities or venues. Daniela Scalia normally hosts the event with guests. The allure of the events is very straight, more history focused in academic ambient, more colloquial and rich in episodes and humor in public houses.  Personal life  Tramontin was born with a deformity at the right hand. Although he had frequent surgery in his first years, he said that it never affected his sports ability, his social life or guitar playing. He jokes about it on his shows. Tramontin has never received compensation or any kind of support for the deformity on his right hand being the indemnity only for born until 31.12.1965. His family and he paid for all the 16 surgeries, including the 13 skin transplant from the buttock to the fingers. Tramontin was nicknamed \\"Diavolo\\" (Devil) by Pierpaolo Pedroni in 1987. Pedroni was Tramontin's rival on the field, and a good friend and rock buddy off-field. Pedroni has appeared on Tramontin's shows. Tramontin has residences in Bellinzona, Switzerland. Tramontin also plays field hockey, floorball, cricket, tennis, badminton, and swimming. With regards to cricket, he said that he \\"never saw someone bowling worse than me\\". He is a supporter of the Alleghe Hockey club.  Early life  Tramontin was born in Belluno, Italy to Vally Carnio and Elio Tramontin. He lived in Mestre, Venice until the age of 10; he often spent time with his maternal grandmother Elvira, who was a French-raised Hungarian, and grandfather Mario, whom he credits as \\"the biggest influence besides Rolling Stones\\". He and his younger brother Diego often moved several times between mother's and father's house after parents split and spent time in different places in the Belluno area to eventually move back to Mestre. He learned to play rugby and was persuaded to try soccer because of a deformity in his right hand. During the off seasons for rugby, he would play different sports, including swimming, street hockey, basketball, beach volleyball, tennis and badminton. He said there were \\"too many to recall, I just remember I was very limited in everything I practised, but t was good fun and good training for rugby\\". At school, the Tramontin brothers had a reputation of being \\"very bad students\\" and \\"loud pranksters\\" who would \\"rather play rugby and hard rock\\", but \\"eventually blossomed at university\\". Luca played several times against Diego, who would become a professional rugby player, in the Italian 1st division rugby; he claimed it was very ordinary to be physical to each other and stressed that Diego was a much better player than he.  Cooking Show  Admittedly a \\"no-cook\\" that only and highly enjoys food in a healthy manner, Luca has been surprisingly called as a guest in the most known Swiss cook show, \\"Piattoforte\\", the logic of producer Aldina Crespi being to highlight the contrast between the cook, the food loving environment and the natural \\"punk\\" attitude of Tramontin. The show registered high numbers and has been prolonged to 5 days.

L'Acad√©mie Imp√©rial des Sciences, St Petersbourg The fortress served as a Safavid Iranian outpost in the 1650s until the rebellious Georgians captured and demolished it. Only insignificant ruins of the Bakhtrioni fortress have survived. History The name of the Bakhtrioni fortress derives from the former village Bakhtriani near which it was constructed in the 1650s. It was garrisoned by a Qizilbash force left by the Iranian government to reinforce its authority in the area and protect the Turkic nomads transplanted into the Georgian lands. The fortress overlooked a strategic locale, controlling roads to the Greater Caucasus mountains, inhabited by the bellicose Georgian highlanders of Tusheti, Pshavi, and Khevsureti.Kurtsikidze, Shorena and Chikovani, Vakhtang (2002), \\"Georgia's Pankisi Gorge: An Ethnographic Survey\\" , pp. 30-31. Berkeley Program in Soviet and Post-Soviet Studies Working Paper Series. In 1659 the Georgian highlanders moved to join the rebellious people of Kakheti in a surprise attack on Bakhtrioni. In the ensuing battle, the entire Qizilbash force was annihilated and the rebels proceeded to capture another Iranian stronghold, that of Alaverdi. These events are widely acclaimed in folk tradition which has preserved the names of the highlander heroes of the battle of Bakhtrioni such as the Tush Zezva Gaprindauli, the Khevsur Nadira Khosharauli, and the Pshav Gogolauri. It also inspired the late 19th-century Georgian poet Vazha-Pshavela to write his patriotic epic poem Bakhtrioni (1892). Gamkrelidze, Ekaterine (ed., 2008), Der Dichter Vaza- Psavela.

As it affects the duty of mortgagees (secured lenders), to that extent it can be considered within the periphery of English land law also. The tripartite panel at appeal established negligence on the part of the lender or its auctioneer agent. A 2-1 majority directed an enquiry as to damages (as opposed to rough award ordered at first instance) to be carried out. Facts In 1961, Cuckmere Brick Co had received planning permission to build 100 flats each with a garage on a site of near Maidstone, and received ¬£50,000 mortgage financing from Mutual Finance who valued the land accordingly. By 1964, due to cash flow problems arising from other developments in which Cuckmere was involved, planning permission was subsequently received (with Mutual's approval) to build 35 houses, which would have incurred lower construction costs. Construction had still not commenced by 1966, and Mutual exercised power of sale under the mortgage, putting the land up for auction, and advertising that the property had planning permission for the houses, but not the flats. Cuckmere advised Mutual of the oversight, and the latter told the auctioneer to mention it. They got ¬£44,000 at the auction, and Cuckmere argued that it should have been closer to ¬£75,000 had the planning permission been mentioned properly in the advertisement, indeed had its existence, underpinning the bank's own valuation, been imparted to prospective buyers. Cuckmere sued, asking for an account to be taken on the basis that the defendants should be debited with the price which they could and should have obtained for the site. Mutual counter-claimed for the balance of all moneys due under the mortgage with interest after crediting the plaintiffs with the proceeds of the sale. Plowman J found for the plaintiffs on the claim so as to eclipse the value of the counterclaim, accepting credible evidence that ¬£65,000 was the price that could and should have been obtained for the land but for the defendants' default or failure to take reasonable precautions in relation to the sale. Both parties appealed to the Court of Appeal. Judgment The appeal was allowed in part, being sent back to an inquiry as to damages, potentially to lower those awarded. The respondent borrower was awarded of the costs of the appeal. Generally agreeing on the applicable test, two Lord Justices of Appeal saw the case was returned for an inquiry as to damages, on the basis that the price at which the land could probably have been sold was still unclear (one judge used the fading language, \\"at large\\"), the third would have fully upheld the original damages award. Salmon LJ held that Mutual Finance had breached its duty of care to Cuckmere.

Facts Mrs Ellis fell into arrears after her husband left. A credible payment plan for her would have taken 98 years. She applied for suspension of a warrant for possession because she wanted sell the property in three to five years when her children had finished full-time education. To support her application, she gave the opinions of estate agents showing what the likely sale price would be. This was argued to be enough to discharge the debt and therefore the mortgage, balancing the interests of her children and the interest of the lender who was no longer receiving full mortgage instalments. The Judge (at first instance, the court below the appeal made) granted an order to delay.

The equity of redemption means that borrowers are able to sell or obtain new mortgage finance promptly and without impinging on other dependent transactions. Background A person who borrows money that is secured against an interest in land (the mortgagor) has a right to redeem the mortgage on repayment of the principal (sum) (plus interest if required by the deed and permitted by the law, such as in a commercial agreement, plus any arrears). This right was enforced by courts of equity and is the equity of redemption. Courts of equity would not permit restrictions on this right, and \\"[a]ny provision inserted to prevent redemption on payment or performance of the debt or obligation for which the security was given, is what is meant by a clog or fetter upon the equity of redemption and is therefore void\\".Santley v Wilde [1899] 2 Ch 474 per Lord Lindley, cited with approval by Lord Halsbury LC in . It means a person can sell land promptly, or obtain a new mortgage promptly. =Facts= The Federal Hotel, Katanning, 2018 A person entered into a 20-year lease of the Federal Hotel in Katanning, Western Australia in June 1905 and Fairclough purchased the unexpired term of (actual possession not landlord's reversion of) the lease in 1907. Fairclough borrowed ¬£500 from the Swan Brewery Co Ltd, repayable in monthly instalments until May 1925(the rest of the term of the lease less 35 days). The mortgage stated that: #Fairclough could not pay out the loan early without the consent of the Swan Brewery; and #an exclusive dealing clause that Fairclough would only purchase beer from the Swan Brewery. The effect of being tied to the Swan Brewery was that Fairclough could only get a discount of 5% on the price of beer, while a free house could get a 12.5% discount. In late 1909 the Swan Brewery was having difficulty supplying enough beer due to a shortage of casks. Fairclough commenced selling beer from other breweries and in January 1910 sought to repay the debt plus the agreed interest. The Swan Brewery did not consent and insisted that the debt could not be repaid until May 1925.. =Prior actions= The Swan Brewery commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of Western Australia seeking to enforce the exclusive dealing clause and Fairclough made a cross claim seeking equitable relief against the mortgage and damages for the Swan Brewery failing to supply enough beer. Fairclough's damages claim for failing to supply enough beer was settled for ¬£75.. McMillan J held that Fairclough did not need to borrow the ¬£500 but that the Swan Brewery had insisted upon it in order to make sure that the Federal Hotel sold beer exclusively from the Swan Brewery. As there was no mutual benefit for the term of 17.5 years, Fairclough had a right to redeem the mortgage. The Swan Brewery were entitled to damages of ¬£8 for the few weeks between when Fairclough started selling beer from other breweries and when he sought to redeem the mortgage. The Swan Brewery appealed to the Full Court of the Supreme Court. Parker CJ, Burnside and Rooth JJ allowed the appeal, finding that a mortgagor was only entitled to redeem a mortgage only after discharge of all the obligations under the mortgage, which included the exclusive dealing clause. This was a bargain freely entered into, with no question of fraud, duress or unfair dealing. The exclusive dealing clause was a collateral advantage that the Swan Brewery was able to obtain and enforce. Fairclough appealed to the Privy Council. Judgment The advice of the Privy Council was delivered by Lord Macnaghten, which held that there was a broad rule that the right of redemption could not be hampered or crippled, noting that \\"The rule in comparatively recent times was unsettled by certain decisions in the Court of Chancery in England which seem to have misled the learned Judges in the Full Court. But it is now firmly established by the House of Lords that the old rule still prevails and that equity will not permit any device or contrivance being part of the mortgage transaction or contemporaneous with it to prevent or impede redemption.\\" A mortgage cannot be made irredeemable and in this case the provision for redemption was nugatory in that it could only be done at a time when the lease was at the point of expiring. Collateral advantages The House of Lords later held in Kreglinger v New Patagonia Meat and Cold Storage Co Ltd,. that collateral advantages in a mortgage could be and could only be upheld if they are \\"not either (1) unfair and unconscionable, or (2) in the nature of the penalty clogging the equity of redemption or (3) inconsistent with or repugnant to the contractual and equitable right to redeem,\\" There has been some judicial debate in Australia as to the status of the decision in Fairclough v Swan Brewery Co Ltd. Fairclough v Swan Brewery Co Ltd has been cited by the High Court, though not in a way essential to the decision. The Supreme Court of NSW has twice held that while the High Court was bound by the decision at the time it was delivered, the High Court was no longer bound by decisions of the Privy Council nor the Supreme Court of NSW and that there was \\"no reason why ... the courts should not rid us of this vestigial rule\\". per Gzell J. per Barrett J. This approach has been rejected in the Supreme Court of Queensland, where it was held that \\"[g]iven the long established authority on which the traditional approach is based, and its support in the seriously considered dicta of the High Court it should be followed by courts below the High Court\\". per Henry J. =Exclusive dealing= In Australia, most types of exclusive dealing are against the law only when they substantially lessen competition. exclusive dealing.

A letter in the same terms was sent to Mrs Ropaigealach at a different address. The bank wrote again, on 7 November to Mr and Mrs Ropaigealach at their home, the security, 16 Windsor Esplanade. Before the end of the year the bank sold it at auction.EWCA Civ 1960 The Ropaigealachs did not receive the last letter from Barclays (with final demand for payment, as earlier, warning the property would be sold but more imminently) because they were having it renovated and were away. They heard of the impending nature of the sale through a neighbour. Judgment Chadwick LJ gave the leading judgment, he said that it was impossible to be satisfied that Parliament had intended, when enacting section 36 of the Administration of Justice Act 1970, that the mortgagee's common law right to take possession by virtue of his estate should be exercisable only with the assistance of the court. The only conclusion as to Parliament's intention which the court could properly reach was that which could be derived from the circumstances in which the section had been enacted, the statutory context in which it appeared, and the language used, and all pointed in the same direction. This meant there would be no declaration to stop Barclays' repossession (taking place without a court order). The legislation could not be \\"otherwise construed\\", that is interpreted to provide that protection.[2000] QB 263, 283 > It does however strike me as very curious that mortgagors should only have > protection in the case where the mortgagee chooses to take legal proceedings > and not in the case where he chooses simply to enter the property. It was not possible to infer that Parliament intended to cover such a case (i.e. use creative purposive interpretation). Clarke LJ held under statute at the time, borrowers only have protection in the case where the lender has begun legal proceedings and not in the case of arrears where the lender simply has the right reserved where a demand is unpaid and chooses [if legally entitled] to enter. He added > the problem... in a case where the mortgagee has already exercised his power > of sale, without having taken possession...The Law Commission has made > proposals to reform the law in this field. It is for Parliament to decide > whether to accept those or other proposals. Significance The common law doctrine of peaceable entry by a mortgagee into mortgaged premises (allowed by mortgages which exclude section 103 of the Law of Property Act) may have been tempered by #The law of trespass; and #If a private home, incompatibility with Article 8 of the Human Rights Act 1998. The judgment of the Court of Appeal in Ropaigealach may no longer be regarded as good law. An academic practitioner has devoted an article in a land law journal explaining that in a county court action his client-borrowers had, since 1998, sued their mortgagee (secured lender) who have exercised their purported rights to sell their home without any court order. The lender quickly agreed to pay damages and costs to the borrower rather than defend a claim in trespass.\\"Peaceable entry to mortgaged premises: considering the doctrine‚Äôs compatibility with Art 8 HRA.\\" Loveland, I. Conveyancer and Property Lawyer 2014 (5) pp. 381-397. Decisions of the final court of appeal demonstrate that the application of the Convention to the property relations of non-governmental persons is a challenging task, requiring the clearance of multiple hurdles.Modern Studies in Property Law - Volume 3 p.165; Professor Elizabeth Cooke, (Ed.); 2005; Hart Publishing, London and Portland, Oregon In Manchester City Council v Pinnock the Supreme Court eventually accepted that HRA Art 8 created a freestanding statutory defence to a possession claim in respect of a person‚Äôs home. It clarified that the meanings of Art 8 ECHR and Art 8 HRA 1998 Sch.1 in the context of lender's repossession as to a home are identical and therefore perhaps also any sale. It used Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 to interpret a pre-1998 statute purposively.\\"Sorry, we've sold your home: mortgagees and their possessory rights\\" Professor Martin Dixon The Cambridge Law Journal [1998] 58(02):265 - 293 especially at 281 This latter case was made trite law by the European Court of Human Rights in: Kay v United Kingdom [2011] H.L.R. 2 stating: > 68\\\\.

Under section 36 Administration of Justice Act 1970 (as amended), the lender should, for an owner-occupier mortgage borrower facing temporary income difficulties set a clearly sustainable payment plan based on good evidence assessed such as, if proportionate to its own expected interests, to pay off the arrears over all of the remaining term of the mortgage rather than necessarily the shortest payment plan possible. This will spare the high cost and inconvenience to the borrower of the lender's repeated applications to the court for a Final Possession Order if the arrears continue to accumulate on facts where the court is merely likely spread out further the repayment of the arrears. The panel of judges unanimously overturned the courts below and rebuked the parties' repeated applications which resulted in a series of court hearings and orders -- each imposing more affordable payment plans still within the term of the mortgage. It instead issued an eightfold list of criteria for future court cases to look to in assessing what order they will make in relation to arrears, taking into account expert evidence including factors cited by the Council of Mortgage Lenders; the aim being to avoid either side engaging in frequent applications (\\"vexatious litigation\\") or other abuse of judicial process.

He is often called \\"the founder of Derry\\", due to his role in establishing the city.Moore, Norman \\"Henry Docwra\\" Dictionary of National Biography 1885‚Äì1900 Vol.15 p.140 Background He was born at Chamberhouse Castle, Crookham, near Thatcham, Berkshire, into a minor gentry family, the Docwras, who came originally from Yorkshire.McGurk, John Sir Henry Docwra 1564‚Äì1631 ‚Äì Derry's Second Founder Four Courts Press Dublin 2007 p.18 He was the only son of Edmund Docwra MP and his wife Dorothy Golding, daughter of John Golding of Halstead, Essex, and sister of the noted translator Arthur Golding.Some sources refer to his mother as Marjorie Puttenham. His father was a prominent local politician, who sat in the House of Commons as MP for Aylesbury in the Parliament of 1571. He was later obliged by financial difficulties to sell Chamberhouse. The family's money troubles may be the reason why his son pursued a military career.Ford, David Nash Royal Berkshire History The Docwras seem to have lacked influential relatives, and this was to be a considerable difficulty to Henry throughout his career, in an age when family connections were of great importance. Military career After serving for some years as a professional soldier in the Netherlands and France, Docwra, who was still only in his early twenties, was sent by the English Crown to Ireland in about 1584. He was made the constable of Dungarvan Castle, and served under Sir Richard Bingham, the governor of Connaught, in 1586. Bingham besieged Annis Castle near Ballinrobe, and used Ballinrobe as a base from which to attempt to pacify County Mayo. He was unable to subdue the Burke clan, the dominant political force in Mayo, and the campaign ended inconclusively.Moore p.140 =Service with Essex and Vere= Docwra left Ireland around 1590. Like other ambitious young courtiers of the time, he entered the service of the Earl of Essex, the royal favourite, and fought beside him in the war against Spain.McGurk pp.37‚Äì40 He took part in the Siege of Rouen in 1591-2, and in the Capture of Cadiz in 1596 where he was knighted by Essex in person for unspecified \\"acts of valour\\". The following year he saw military service under Sir Francis Vere in Maurice of Nassau's campaigns in Brabant, and spent much of the late 1590s in the Netherlands where he distinguished himself at the Battle of Turnhout. He did not take part in Essex's ill-fated Islands Voyage expedition to the Azores in 1597.McGurk p.41 Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex =Return to Ireland= In 1599, to his \\"unspeakable contentment\\", he was sent back to Ireland to serve with Essex during the Nine Years War, acting as his chief adviser on Irish military affairs. During Essex's disastrous attempts to pacify Ireland, Docwra was mainly occupied with attempting to subdue the O'Byrne clan in County Wicklow.McGurk p.39 He took no part in Essex's controversial negotiations with Hugh O'Neill, who was the overall Irish leader during the Nine Years' War. These negotiations produced a set of terms called the Cessation, which was attacked by Essex's enemies as a total English capitulation to the Irish. The Queen's reaction was to tell Essex sharply that if she had wanted to abandon Ireland altogether, it would hardly have been necessary to send him there. Docwra had returned to England with Essex in the autumn of 1599. In 1600 he was sent back to Ireland as commander of an army of 4000 men and captured the ruined site of Derry in May 1600. Fighting continued until 1603.William Kelly‚Äôs edition of Docwra‚Äôs Derry The Cessation led quickly to Essex's disgrace, and that in turn caused his rebellion against Queen Elizabeth I, which ended with his execution as a traitor in February 1601. Docwra, who had prudently remained in Ireland throughout the crisis, was not suspected of any part in Essex's plotting, and he quickly gained the confidence of Essex's successor as Lord Deputy of Ireland, Mountjoy, although they were later to quarrel over Docwra's policy in Ulster. His biographer remarks that if he was not usually highly regarded as a politician, Docwra did at least have the true politician's instinct for survival.McGurk p.51 Conquest of Ulster In April 1600 Docwra was given an army of 4200 men to subdue Ulster.McGurk p.53 He landed at Carrickfergus, and proceeded to Culmore, where he fortified both the ruined castle there and Flogh, near Inishowen, Donegal. Proceeding to what is now Derry, he fortified the hill, and laid out the first streets of the new city. Further up the River Foyle he fortified Dunnalong, a position dividing Donegal and Tyrone, in July 1600. He constructed Dutch-inspired star-shaped bastion forts, each with a strong earthen rampart, surrounded by a ditch, at the three sites of Culmore, Derry and Dunnalong. He also engaged in several skirmishes with the Irish, reportedly winning their admiration for his courage and cunning, and was severely wounded by Black Hugh O'Donnell, a cousin of Red Hugh O'Donnell, chief of the O'Donnell Clan.McGurk p.76 Throughout his career in Ulster, he showed remarkable skill in fostering divisions in the leading Irish clans, and he gained the support of several prominent Irish chieftains, including members of the dominant O'Neill and O'Donnell clans. His most notable diplomatic coup was to win for the Crown, at least for a time, the loyalty of Niall Garve O'Donnell, cousin and brother-in-law of Red Hugh.McGurk p.92 A charge often levelled against Docwra by his enemies was of his gullibility in believing in the promises of loyalty made by the Gaelic chieftains, and differences over this policy later led to a quarrel between Docwra and Mountjoy. In fact, Docwra, who was a sensible man, had no expectation of any of the chieftains remaining loyal \\"if the Spaniards should approach these shores\\", or if the English suffered any decisive military defeat at the hands of the Irish. His attitude was simply that, so long as it lasted, the support of men like Niall Garve was a political asset which the English should exploit to its fullest extent.McGurk p.146 The winter of 1600/1601 was spent in further military expeditions, and in negotiations with the Irish. In 1602 he secured Dungiven Castle from Donnell Ballagh O'Cahan, the principal vassal or 'uriaght' of Hugh O'Neill. This gave him control of most of what is now County Londonderry, and led O'Cahan to switch sides, depriving O'Neill of a large portion of his remaining force. He joined forces with Mountjoy to finally crush Hugh O'Neill, who made his submission to Mountjoy at Mellifont in March 1603. The military campaign is said to have been one of exceptional savagery, resulting in the death of thousands of Irish civilians.McGurk p.198 On the death of Queen Elizabeth I, it was Docwra's firm action which prevented a rising in the north of Ireland by his chief Irish ally, Niall Garve O'Donnell, who was infuriated at not having been made Earl of Tyrconnell, a title which was instead conferred on his cousin Rory O'Donnell. Niall was, in the short term, persuaded to trust in the promise of further rewards from the Crown. Clearly his loyalty could not be depended on for much longer, but then Docwra had never had any trust in the permanent loyalty of the Gaelic chiefs.Moore, p.140 Founder of Derry This map of Derry c. 1607 is one of the earliest known images of the city. Docwra's reputation as \\"the founder of Derry\\" rests on his early attempts to develop Derry as a city, although in the short term his efforts came to nothing, as it was burnt to the ground in 1608. Docwra had hoped that his services to the Crown in the Nine Years' War would produce rich rewards, and he seems to have set his heart on being created Lord President of Ulster; but he had never been popular, even with his own soldiers. Also, he lacked powerful friends at court, where he was regarded as something of a nuisance. It was said that there was nothing which the Queen and her Council dreaded more than yet another verbose letter from Docwra, angrily replying to any criticism of his conduct. Sir Robert Cecil eventually decided not to trouble the Queen with his letters. He had to be content with being appointed the first governor and provost of Derry. The city's first charter empowered him to hold markets and a fair. It was his duty to appoint the sheriffs, the recorder and the justices of the peace and to hold a county court. Docwra was beginning to tire of life in Ireland, although he did not return to England until 1608. In 1606 he was bought out of his public offices by Sir George Paulet, whose relations with the Irish leaders of Ulster, and particularly the ruler of Inishowen, Sir Cahir O'Doherty, whose loyalty Docwra had sought to win, were far less amicable.New History of Ireland, vol.3 eds. Moody, Martin and Byrne (OUP 1991) p.196 During O'Doherty's subsequent rising in 1608, O'Doherty's foster-father Phelim Reagh MacDavitt killed Paulet in battle and Derry was burned.Docwra's Narrative edited by William P. Kelly 2003 p.2 Docwra's policy of seeking to conciliate the leading Gaelic nobles of Ulster was now utterly discredited. He was accused of neglect of duty and undue leniency towards the native Irish, and retired to England in temporary disgrace. Following the Flight of the Earls, and the O'Doherty rebellion, the English Crown no longer saw any advantage in conciliating the chieftains of Ulster: Docwra's Irish allies were ruined, and many of them, including Donnell O'Cahan, Niall Garve O'Donnell, and his son Neachtain, died as prisoners in the Tower of London. Later career During his retirement in England, Docwra protested bitterly to King James I that he had been unfairly accused of incompetence, and of his meagre rewards for his services to the Crown: in particular he complained of the failure to make him Lord President of Ulster. In 1614 he published his Narrative, which is both a description of, and a justification for, his military actions in Ireland. While obviously self-serving, the Narrative is a valuable source of information for the period.Reprinted 2003, edited by William P. Kelly His decade-long campaign to return to government employment, preferably in Ireland, finally bore fruit. In 1616 he was made Treasurer of War for Ireland and returned to live there. In 1621 he was raised to the peerage, with a modest grant of land at Ranelagh, now a suburb, but then a village on the south side of Dublin city, and another estate at Donnybrook. Despite his title, he was a comparatively poor man, partly because he had not been given the office of Vice-Treasurer of Ireland, which had previously been associated with the office of Treasurer of War, so that Docrwa's income was half what he might have expected. After his death all his colleagues praised him as \\"an honest man who died poor\\".McGurk p.242 As Treasurer he avoided the temptation, to which so many of his contemporaries succumbed, of using his office to enrich himself; in 1618 the Privy Council of England commended him to the Lord Deputy for his care and diligence in carrying out his duties. His one serious fault as Treasurer, it was generally agreed, was his exceptional slowness in compiling his accounts.McGurk p.248 In 1628 he was one of 15 peers empanelled to try Edmond Butler, Lord Dunboyne for manslaughter after Butler had killed his cousin, James Prendergast, in a quarrel over the right of inheritance to an Irish feudal barony. Docwra was the only one to vote \\"guilty\\", and Dunboyne was duly acquitted by 14 votes to 1.Moore, p.140 Docwra died on 18 April 1631 in Dublin, shortly after retiring from his public offices, and was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin.McGurk p.22 His fellow Irish councillors sent a petition to their English colleagues, praising him as \\"an excellent civil servant\\", who died (relatively) poor, and recommended his widow and surviving children to their care.McGurk p.269 Family He married Anne Vaughan, daughter of Sir Francis Vaughan of Sutton- upon-Derwent and his wife Anne Boynton, daughter of Sir Thomas Boynton.McGurk p.20 They had two sons, Theodore and Henry. Theodore, the elder son, succeeded to the barony but died without issue. Little is known of him except that he was obliged to sell his Ranelagh estate and was living in poverty when he died in England in 1647: since his brother Henry had predeceased him, the title became extinct.McGurk p.21 The 1st Baron also had three daughters, Anne, Frances, who died young, and Elizabeth; Anne married Captain Shore of Fermanagh, and Elizabeth married Basil Brooke of Brookeborough.Moore, p.140 Lady Docwra outlived her husband and both of her sons, and survived till 1648: like her elder son she was in a state of some poverty in her later years, despite receiving a legacy from Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork, who had been a close friend and ally of her late husband in his last years.McGurk p.22 Character As a soldier Docwra was brave, skilful and ruthless; the Irish reportedly admired him as \\"an illustrious knight of wisdom and prudence, a pillar of battle and conflict\\".McGurk p.270 He showed considerable skill in negotiating with the Irish clans, and was known for fomenting quarrels among them to strengthen the Crown's position.Moore, p.140 Historians have remarked that the accusations made against Docwra by his political enemies of excessive \\"leniency\\" towards the Irish would have astonished the Irish themselves, thousands of whom are said to have died directly or indirectly as a result of his actions.McGurk p.26 As Treasurer of War, he had his critics, but he also enjoyed an enviable reputation for being diligent, conscientious and upright, if rather slow in conducting business.McGurk p.248 In private life he had a reputation for being honest, public-spirited, and a man of independent judgment. In religious matters he is said, by the standards of the time, to have been tolerant enough. While there is no doubt that English troops who were under his command killed a number of priests, his biographer argues that Docwra neither ordered nor approved of these killings.McGurk p,20 References Category:Barons in the Peerage of Ireland Category:People from Thatcham Category:People from Bradfield, Berkshire Category:People from Derry (city) Category:Irish generals Category:1564 births Category:1631 deaths Category:16th-century Anglo-Irish people Category:People of the Nine Years' War (Ireland) Henry Category:17th-century Anglo-Irish people ","title":"Henry Docwra, 1st Baron Docwra of Culmore"},{"id":"35738349","text":"Glen Martin may refer to: *Glen Martin, New South Wales *Glen W.

He later lived in Vienna (1927) where he studied philosophy before returning to Slovakia, working as a journalist and publishing poetry. In 1930, he moved to Prague where he became a cartoonist.\\"Endre Nemes\\" , Galerie Bel'Art, Stockholm. Retrieved 8 May 2012. Whilst in Prague, he studied at the Prague Art Academy, where he met Peter Weiss and Bernard Reder and collaborated with Jakub Bauernfreund. Nemes held his first exhibition with Jakub Bauernfreund at the Dr. Feigl Gallery. As a Jew, he escaped from Czechoslovakia before World War II, was in Helsinki in 1938, traveled through Finland and Norway, and ended up in Sweden where he held his first solo exhibition in 1941 in Stockholm. Just prior to Weiss's March 1941 exhibition at Masshallen, Brunkebergsplate, Nemes had shown his work at the same venue. He became a Swedish citizen in 1948. From 1947 to 1955, he was director and innovator for Valand School of Fine Arts in Gothenburg. He also worked on sets and costumes for the opera house and the municipal theatre. His fanciful paintings often included harlequins and clocks. Nemes became known for several large public art works and was a pioneer in Sweden in the use of enamels in public art, designing the fa√ßade of the municipal administration building in Alafors and the Zodiak Clock in the center of V√§stertorp. Along with Max Walter Svanberg, C.O. Hult√©n, Adja Yunkers, and Carl O. Svensson, Nemes was a founder of the Minotaur group. In the end of the 1950s, he showed in Zurich and Freiburg, and there was a subsequent retrospective in Lund, Prague, and Salzburg. In 1965, he was awarded a Swedish State stipend and held a notable exhibition at the Drian Galleries in London. His work can be found in the Museum of Modern Art in Stockholm, Philadelphia Art Museum and Brooklyn Museum in the US, the Slovak National Gallery in Bratislava, and the Ferenc Martyn Museum in P√©cs.

By using a variety of treatments, greater improvements are achieved, and, therefore, treatment should not be limited to one method. Furthermore, increasing activity will increase his/her chances of recovery.  Acute recovery  The rehabilitation process following a spinal cord injury typically begins in the acute care setting. Occupational therapy plays an important role in the management of SCI. Recent studies emphasize the importance of early occupational therapy, started immediately after the client is stable. This process includes teaching of coping skills, and physical therapy. Physical therapists, occupational therapists, social workers, psychologists and other health care professionals typically work as a team under the coordination of a physiatrist to decide on goals with the patient and develop a plan of discharge that is appropriate for the patient‚Äôs condition. In the first step, the focus is on support and prevention. Interventions aim to give the individual a sense of control over a situation in which the patient likely feels little independence. As the patient becomes more stable, they may move to a rehabilitation facility or remain in the acute care setting. The patient begins to take more of an active role in their rehabilitation at this stage and works with the team to develop reasonable functional goals. = Respiration = In the acute phase physical and occupational therapists focus on the patient‚Äôs respiratory status, prevention of indirect complications (such as pressure sores), maintaining range of motion, and keeping available musculature active. Depending on the Neurological Level of Impairment (NLI), the muscles responsible for expanding the thorax, which facilitate inhalation, may be affected. If the NLI is such that it affects some of the ventilatory muscles, more emphasis will then be placed on the muscles with intact function. For example, the intercostal muscles receive their innervation from T1‚ÄìT11, and if any are damaged, more emphasis will need to be placed on the unaffected muscles which are innervated from higher levels of the CNS. As SCI patients suffer from reduced total lung capacity and tidal volume it is pertinent that physical therapists teach SCI patients accessory breathing techniques (e.g. apical breathing, glossopharyngeal breathing, etc.) that typically are not taught to healthy individuals. = Functional electrical stimulation = Physical therapists can assist immobilized patients with effective cough techniques, secretion clearance, stretching of the thoracic wall, and suggest abdominal support belts when necessary. The amount of time a patient is immobilized may depend on the level of the spinal cord injury. Physical therapists work with the patient to prevent any complications that may arise due to this immobilization. Other complications that arise from immobilization include muscle atrophy and osteoporosis, especially to the lower limbs, increasing the risk of fractures to the femur and tibia. While passive weight bearing of paralyzed lower extremities appears to be ineffective, stressing the bones through muscular contractions initiated by functional electrical stimulation (FES) has yielded positive results in some cases. The intensity, frequency, and duration of stress to the bones appear to be important determinants of improved bone parameters. Generally, the frequency is effective with three or more weekly exercise sessions. Studies of duration suggest that several months to one or more years of FES are necessary. = Improving locomotor function = Improvement of locomotor function is one of the primary goals for people with a spinal cord injury. SCI treatments may focus on specific goals such as to restore walking or locomotion to an optimal level for the individual. The most effective way to restore locomotion is by complete repair, but techniques are not yet developed for regeneration. Treadmill training, over groundtraining, and functional electrical stimulation can all be used to improve walking or locomotor activity. These activities work if neurons of the central pattern generator (CPG) circuits, which generate rhythmic movements of the body, are still functioning. With inactivity, the neurons of CPG degenerate. Therefore, the above activities are important for keeping neurons active until regeneration activities are developed. A 2012 systematic review found insufficient evidence to conclude which locomotor training strategy improves walking function most for people with spinal cord injury. This suggests that it is not the type of training used, but the goals and the routines that have the biggest impact. Applying spinal cord stimulation (transcutaneous or epidurally) during weight supported walking have been shown to improve locomotor output. =Provision= In the English NHS a serious shortage of specialist beds was identified by a review in December 2016. There were 393 and 54 additional beds were required. Patients waited an average of 52 days for a bed on a specialist ward in 2015-16. This meant patients were ‚Äúinappropriately‚Äù occupying beds at major trauma centres. It was suggested that NHS England‚Äôs specialised commissioning division would be unable to fund the recommendations. According to the Spinal Injuries Association, of 2,494 referrals in 2017-18 to specialist spinal cord injury centres, only 800 were admitted and many more patients were not referred at all.  Post-discharge rehabilitation therapy  Though rehabilitation interventions are performed during the acute phase, recent literature suggests that 44% of the total hours spent on rehabilitation during the first year after spinal cord injury, occur after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Participants in this study received 56% of their total physical therapy hours and 52% of their total occupational therapy hours after discharge. This suggests that inpatient rehabilitation lengths of stay are reduced and that post-discharge therapy may replace some of the inpatient treatment. = Functional independence = Whether patients are placed in inpatient rehabilitation or discharged, occupational therapists attempt to maximize functional independence at this stage. Depending on the level of the spinal cord injury, whatever sparing the patient has is optimized. Bed mobility, transfers, wheelchair mobility skills, and performing other activities of daily living (ADLs) are just a few of the interventions that occupational therapists can help the patient with.Pendleton, H. M., & Schultz-Krohn, W. (2006). Pedretti's occupational therapy: Practice skills for physical dysfunction. (6th ed.). St Louis, MO: Mosby Elsevier. A major problem for spinal cord injury patients is restricted range of motion. Massage therapy has been used to aid in range of motion rehabilitation. Literature has shown that participants with spinal cord injuries that had massage therapy added into their rehabilitation had significant improvement observed by physical therapist in functional living activities and limb range of motion. This could be due to the decrease in H-Reflex amplitudes measured by EMG that is critical for the comfort of spinal cord injury patients for reducing cramps and spasms. ADLs can be difficult for an individual with a spinal cord injury; however, through the rehabilitation process, individuals with SCI may be able to live independently in the community with or without full-time attendant care, depending on the level of their injury. Further interventions focus on support and education for the individual and caregivers. This includes an evaluation of limb function to determine what the patient is capable of doing independently, and teaching the patient self-care skills. Independence in daily activities like eating, bowel and bladder management, and mobility is the goal, as obtaining competency in self-care tasks contributes significantly to an individual's sense of self- confidence and reduces the burden on caregivers. Quality of life issues such as sexual health and function after spinal cord injury are also addressed.  Assistive devices  Assistive devices such as wheelchairs have a substantial effect on the quality of life of the patient, and careful selection is important. Teaching the patient how to transfer from different positions, such as from a wheelchair into bed, is an important part of therapy, and devices such as sliding transfer boards and grab bars can assist in these tasks. Individuals who are able to transfer independently from their wheelchair to the driver's seat using a sliding transfer board may be able to return to driving in an adapted vehicle. Complete independence with driving also requires the ability to load and unload one's wheelchair from the vehicle. In addition to acquiring skills such as wheelchair transfers, individuals with a spinal cord injury can greatly benefit from exercise reconditioning. In the majority of cases, spinal cord injury leaves the lower limbs either entirely paralyzed, or with insufficient strength, endurance, or motor control to support safe and effective physical training. Therefore, most exercise training employs the use of arm crank ergometry, wheelchair ergometry, and swimming. In one study, subjects with traumatic spinal cord injury participated in a progressive exercise training program, which involved arm ergometry and resistance training. Subjects in the exercise group experienced significant increases in strength for almost all muscle groups when compared to the control group. Exercisers also reported less stress, fewer depressive symptoms, greater satisfaction with physical functioning, less pain, and better quality of life. Physical therapists are able to provide a variety of exercise interventions, including, passive range of motion exercises, upper body wheeling (arm crank ergometry), functional electrical stimulation, and electrically stimulated resistance exercises all of which can improve arterial function in those living with SCI. Physical therapists can improve the quality of life of individuals with spinal cord injury by developing exercise programs that are tailored to meet individual patient needs. Adapted physical activity equipment can also be used to allow for sport participation: for example, sit-skiis can be used by individuals with a spinal cord injury for cross-country or downhill skiing. The patient's living environment can also be modified to improve independence. For example, ramps or lifts can be added to a patient's home, and part of rehabilitation involves investigating options for returning to previous interests as well as developing new pursuits. Community participation is an important aspect in maintaining quality of life.  Gait training  Body weight supported treadmill training is another intervention that physiotherapists may assist with. Body weight supported treadmill training has been researched in an attempt to prevent bone loss in the lower extremities in individuals with spinal cord injury. Research has shown that early weight-bearing after acute spinal cord injury by standing or treadmill walking (5 times weekly for 25 weeks) resulted in no loss or only moderate loss in trabecular bone compared with immobilized subjects who lost 7-9% of trabecular bone at the tibia. Gait training with body weight support, among patients with incomplete spinal cord injuries, has also recently been shown to be more effective than conventional physiotherapy for improving the spatial-temporal and kinematic gait parameters. A combination of Body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) and robotic-assisted BWSTT is being implemented into some training programs. The benefits include: (1) assist in reproducing leg movements and optimizing gait pattern (speed, step length, amplitude); (2) training sessions can be prolonged and walking speed can be adjusted, increasing motor outcome; (3) provides consistency of movement, where manual interventions/cues by a trainer may be variable (although a trainer should analyze the gait pattern and outcome measures of the training and supervise training). It is important to note that the patient must be an active participant during the robotic movements and try to move with the robot. This type of training would be implemented during the beginning of rehabilitation and progressed to independent locomotion as improvements are made. However, robotic-assisted BWSTT is expensive and often not affordable by physiotherapy clinics. As an alternative, the development of non-motorized exoskeletons are currently being investigated for patients with incomplete SCI. The development of the exoskeleton locomotor device would provide an inexpensive alternative to the robotic devices. The exoskeleton may be used in areas that can not afford robotic devices, or, in areas that can not provide adequate physiotherapy care. Restorative neurology offers a different paradigm of treating spinal cord injury by focusing on the residual remaining motor control and on the intrinsic function of the sub-lesional spinal cord segments.

Multimers generally range in size from dimers to octamers; however, some companies use even higher quantities of MHC per multimer. Multimers may be used to display class 1 MHC, class 2 MHC, or nonclassical molecules (e.g. CD1d) from species such as monkeys, mice, and humans.  Background  Since T-cell receptors have a low affinity for their MHC counterparts, it was historically problematic to label T cells effectively using single MHC-T-cell interactions.Nepom, Gerald T. \\"MHC Multimers: Expanding the Clinical Toolkit,\\" Clinical Immunology, Vol 6 (2003), pp. 1-4.,Antigen. 106 (2003), pp. 1-4. However, in 1996 it was proposed by John Altman to use a complex of multiple MHC molecules to form a more stable bond between corresponding T-cells.Bakker, Arnold; Schumacher, Tom. \\"MHC Multimer Technology: Current Status and Future Prospects,\\" Current Opinion in Immunology, Vol. 17, No. 4 (August 2005), pp. 428-433.  Production  The most commonly used MHC multimers are tetramers. These are typically produced by biotinylating soluble MHC monomers, which are typically produced recombinantly in eukaryotic or bacterial cells. These monomers then bind to a backbone, such as streptavidin or avidin, creating a tetravalent structure. These backbones are conjugated with fluorochromes to subsequently isolate bound T-cells via flow cytometry.  Potential clinical applications  MHC multimers allow for a previously unattainable level of specificity in antigen- specific T-cell detection and isolation. This ability gives rise to several clinical applications. MHC multimers allow for ex vivo selection and proliferation of T-cells specific to viral or tumor-related antigens, which can then be reintroduced to augment the immune system. MHC multimers can also be used to eliminate graft-originating T-cells on transplant organs, ex vivo. MHC multimers may also be used to eliminate harmful or unwanted T-cells in vivo, such as those that target self cells and lead to autoimmune disease. Cancer immunotherapy and vaccine development can also be largely influenced by this technology.Davis, Mark M.; Altman, John D.; Newell, Evan W. \\"Interrogating the Repertoire: Broadening the Scope of Peptide-MHC Multimer Analysis,\\" Nature Reviews Immunology, Vol. 11, No. 8 (July 15, 2011), pp. 551-558.  Sub-types  = MHC tetramer = MHC tetramers consist of four MHC molecules, a tetramerization agent and a fluorescently labeled protein (usually streptavidin). Streptavidins have also been generated with 6 or 12 binding sites for MHC. MHC tetramers are used to identify and label specific T-cells by epitope specific binding, allowing the antigen specific immune response to be analyzed in both animal model and in human.Erfle V, inventor; 2004 Jul. 15. MHC tetramers. United States patent US 20040137642. MHC tetramers were originally developed using MHC class I molecules for the recognition of cytotoxic T cells, but over the last decade they have allowed for the recognition of CD4 T cells by a wide variety of antigens. Tetramer assays are used for single-cell phenotyping and cell counting, and offer an important advantage over other methods, such as ELISPOT and single-cell PCR because they enable the recovery and further study of sorted cells. As a flow- cytometry-based application, tetramers are also easy to use and have a short assay time, similar to Antibody-based flow cytometry studies. MHC tetramers are used in studies of pathogen immunity and vaccine development, in evaluation of antitumor responses, in allergy monitoring and desensitization studies, and in autoimmunity. They provide an ideal means to characterize the T cells that respond to a vaccine, and they have been used to test T cell responses in many vaccine systems, including influenza, yellow fever,Co, M. D., Kilpatrick, E. D. & Rothman, A. L. Dynamics of the CD8 T-cell response following yellow fever virus 17D immunization\\" Immunology 2009; 128, e718‚Äìe727 tuberculosis,Wei, H. et al. DR*W201/P65 tetramer visualization of epitope- specific CD4 T-cell during M. tuberculosis infection and its resting memory pool after BCG vaccination\\" PLoS ONE 4, e6905 (2009). HIV/SIV and a large number of cancer vaccine trials, including melanoma and chronic myeloid leukemia.Lee, P. P. et al. Characterization of circulating T cells specific for tumor-associated antigens in melanoma patients. Class II tetramers have been used for analysis of a variety of human CD4 T cell responses to pathogens, including influenza A, Borrelia, Epstein-Barr virus, CMV, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, human T-lymphotropic virus 1, hepatitis C, anthrax, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, human papillomavirus, and HIV. Tetramer variants have been developed that, either radiolabelled or coupled to a toxin such as saporin, can be injected into live mice to modulate or even deplete specific T cell populations. Peptide‚ÄìMHC tetramers have also been used therapeutically. For instance, cytomegalovirus-specific T cells have been enriched to high levels of purity using magnetic bead-based enrichment for use as a therapy for stem cell transplant patients. = MHC pentamer = Pentamers consist of five MHC-peptide headgroups, arranged in a planar configuration so that, unlike MHC tetramers, all of the headgroups can contact the CD8+ T cell. The headgroups are connected via flexible linkers to a coiled-coil multimerization domain, which in turn is connected to five fluorescent or biotin tags. Pentamers are available with APC, R-PE, or biotin labelling, and also unlabelled with separate tags for long-term storage. Pentamers offer enhanced brightness and avidity of staining compared with other multimer reagents. MHC pentamers have been used in the detection of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in flow cytometry, and are cited in over 750 peer reviewed publications , including several in the journals Nature and Science. MHC pentamers can also be used in tissue staining, and in magnetic isolation of antigen-specific T cells. While pentamers are licensed for research use only, in 2009 a special dispensation was granted for a team to use them for isolating EBV-specific T cells for mother-daughter transfer, for lifesaving treatment of EBV-associated lymphoma in the daughter. Pentamers are available for antigens from the following disease areas: adenovirus, HCV, malaria, SIV, autoimmune disease, HIV, transplantation antigens, trypanosoma, cancer, HPV, tuberculosis, chlamydia, HTLV, vaccinia, CMV, influenza, VSV, EBV, LCMV, RSV, West Nile virus, HBV, Listeria, Sendai virus, yellow fever. Custom specificity pentamers may also be commissioned. Pentamers are currently used in research by academia, industry and clinicians, and research using pentamers has appeared in the international media on several occasions. = MHC Dextramer = A form of MHC multimer developed and trademarked by the Danish biotechnology company, Immudex in 2002. Dextramer reagents are fluorescently labeled with FITC, PE or APC, and contain MHC molecules attached to a dextran backbone, which are used to detect antigen-specific T-cells in fluid cells and solid tissue samples using flow cytometry. These T-cells contain T-cell receptors (TCR) that recognize a specific MHC-peptide complex displayed on the surface of antigen presenting cells allowing for detection, isolation, and quantification of these specific T-cell populations due to an improved signal-to-noise ratio not present in prior generations of multimers. Dextramers have been developed with a larger number of MHC-peptides for various human, mouse, and rhesus macaque genes involved in diseases including but not limited to: cancer, HIV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), LCMV, human papillomavirus (HPV), BK polyomavirus, HTLV, hepatitis, mycobacterium, and graft-versus-host disease. Dextramer technology is currently used in academic and clinical research due to their increased specificity and binding affinity, which allows for increased avidity for specific T-cells and enhances staining intensity. This advantage is a result of the increased ability of Dextramers to bind multiple times to a single T-cell, improving the stability of this interaction as compared with other multimer technologies such as pentamers and tetramers. Further applications include the ability to isolate antigen specific T-cell populations as well as in situ detection using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for various disease states (e.g. solid tumors). These reagents are therefore important for future drug and vaccine development. Immudex has currently developed a CMV Dextramer assay for exploratory detection and quantification of CD8+ T-cells in blood samples, covering a broad range of epitopes to assist with screening and monitoring CMV progression in future clinical settings.Hadrup SR; Strindhall J; Kollgaard T; et al. \\"Longitudinal studies of clonally expanded CD8 T cells reveal a repertoire shrinkage predicting mortality and an increased number of dysfunctional cytomegalovirus-specific T cells in the very elderly\\". Journal of Immunology, 2006, 176(4), 2645‚Äì2653 Currently Dextramers are only available with MHC class I molecules, and there is future development and research into the applications and production of MHC class II Dextramers.

In December 2006, the Roscommon Hospital Action Committee criticised what it called the \\"fudged language\\" of the Health Service Executive (HSE) on emergency care at the hospital. Later, in August 2010, thousands of people marched through Roscommon to the hospital where they made a human chain. Taoiseach Enda Kenny confirmed the downgrading of emergency services at the hospital while visiting Roscommon to open a constituency office for Denis Naughten on 27 June 2011. He was met by protesters. While campaigning ahead of the general election earlier that year, Kenny had been recorded by a journalist promising emergency care would be kept at the hospital if people voted for Naughten and Frank Feighan. In July 2011, when the downgrading of services had been confirmed and the recording made public, Kenny spoke of his regret for the confusion his words may have caused voters. During July and August 2011, members of the Roscommon Hospital Action Committee protested at Leinster House, at several bridges over the River Shannon, and at a sit-in at the hospital's 24-hour emergency unit. After a woman discovered files containing the personal details of hundreds of patients from the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar, in a bin outside Roscommon Hospital, she gave them to the Roscommon Hospital Action Committee which passed them on to the Data Protection Commissioner.

Founded by E. Paul Breaux, Jr. in 1997, the 100% estate grown winery was one of three United States wineries (and the only Virginia Winery) to be named in the book \\"250 Best Wines 2012\\" by Oz Clarke for their Viognier, which landed at #87 in the publication. Breaux Vineyards is one of Virginia's largest grape growers & suppliers of wine grapes, bulk juice, and bulk wine to other East Coast U.S. wineries. The company logo is a red Crawfish, which pays homage to the Breaux family's Cajun heritage because they are often used in the local Cajun cuisine in Louisiana. History In 1994 the 404 acre property in Loudoun County, Virginia, known as \\"Grand Oak Farm\\" was purchased by E. Paul Breaux, Jr., President and CEO of Sun Realty of Nags Head, Inc. At the time of purchase there were 0.6 acres of Cabernet Sauvignon vines that had been planted in 1985 by David Collins, an independent vineyard consultant and winemaker for Willowcroft Farm Vineyards in Leesburg, Virginia. 2 years later the Breaux family started expanding the vineyard with the assistance of Collins, who would later be hired by Breaux Vineyards to be the head winemaker and vineyard manager. Breaux Vineyards, Ltd. was incorporated in 1997, and the vineyard was expanded from less than 1 acre of cultivated vines in 1996 to 105 acres in 2011. In 2005 E. Paul Breaux, Jr. turned over day-to-day operations to his daughter Jennifer Breaux Blosser and her husband Christopher Blosser, although Breaux maintained the title of CEO for Breaux Vineyards. In the spring of 2011 David Collins left the company to co-found his own project in Rohrersville, Maryland, called \\"Big Cork Vineyards\\". He was replaced at Breaux Vineyards by David Pagan Casta√±o, of Spain. Viticulture The vineyard is a single contiguous property of 105 acres of vines under cultivation for the sole purpose of wine grape production. The soil compositions are mostly Eubanks loam with slopes of varying grades that range between 2 and 15% (57% are 2‚Äì7% grading, and 31% are 7‚Äì15% grading). Eighteen different grape varieties are planted, including 9 white wine grape varieties, and 9 red wine grape varieties. The largest plantings on the property are dedicated to Cabernet Sauvignon (19.5 acres), Vidal blanc (18 acres), and Merlot (17.5 acres). A combination of Lyre and VSP (Vertical Shoot Positioning) vine training systems are used on the property. Breaux Vineyards uses an integrated pest and disease management system due to the demanding and difficult grape growing conditions in Northern Virginia. All vines are maintained and harvested by hand, with mechanization being used for vine spraying and canopy management. Winemaking The winery is equipped with modern winemaking equipment including: 50,000 gallons of wine capacity within their German-manufactured temperature controlled tanks, a full sized Italian bottling line, a large hydraulic bladder grape press, several grape crusher/destemmers, a temperature-controlled grape receiving room/crush pad, and a humidity and temperature-controlled barrel room housing their over 500 wine barrels. Grapes and wines Breaux Vineyards produces between 20-26 wines per year for themselves broken into two types of labels, and potentially many more depending on custom crush contracts where they produce wines for other wineries. The winery currently produces around 12,000 cases (144,000 bottles) per year. = Grapes grown = # Barbera # Cabernet Franc # Cabernet Sauvignon # Chambourcin # Malbec # Merlot # Nebbiolo # Petit Verdot # Syrah # Chardonnay # Muscat blanc # Muscat Giallo # Muscat Orange # Sauvignon blanc # Semillon # Seyval blanc # Vidal blanc # Viognier Awards * Breaux Viognier: 1 of only 3 United States wines to be named to Oz Clarke's list of the \\"250 Best Wines 2012\\", with a placement of #87 in the top 100 section of the publication. * Awarded a Silver Medal at the 2013 \\"Concours Mondial du Sauvignon\\" (translated to 'World Contest of Sauvignon') with the 2012 Breaux Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc, which was the only wine from North America to win a medal in that competition. * Voted in 1st place as \\"Virginia's Favorite Winery\\" in 2011. * Voted in 1st place as \\"Virginia's Favorite Winery\\" in 2010. * Voted in 1st place as \\"Virginia's Favorite Winery\\" in 2009. * Voted in 1st place as \\"Virginia's Favorite Winery\\" in 2008. * Named Best Virginia Winery in 2011 by Northern Virginia Magazine.

Life The cast of Colin McAlpin's opera Robin Hood, at Wellingborough School, 1892. The man in black standing on the right resembles McAlpin. Colin McAlpin was born in 1870, at 15 Gallowtree Gate, Leicester, England. He was the fourth child of a clothier John William McAlpin, and his German wife Marie Louise (n√©e Gerdes). His elder siblings were Kenneth, Donal and Janet, and his younger brothers Alan and John.1871 & 1881 England and Wales Censuses McAlpin published his first composition when he was only 15 and at Wellingborough School: a song called The Cuckoo published in the Midland Musical Journal. At the age of 16 he was admitted to the Royal Academy of Music to study harmony with F. W. Davenport and organ playing with Charles Steggall, and after three years he acquired silver medals in both areas of study. In 1892 Robin Hood, his first dramatic work, was performed at Wellingborough School and that year he was appointed organist and choirmaster at Kensington Presbyterian Church. In 1897, King Arthur, an opera in three acts, commissioned by impresario Herbert Marshall, was performed by the Leicester Philharmonic Society under H. S. Ellis. In that year three of McAlpin's Ten Songs were performed in one of Granville Bantock's concerts for British composers. The Ten Songs were published by Cary & Son, the first of dozens of his pieces to be published by this company. In his thirtieth year McAlpin was appointed organist and choirmaster of Trinity Presbyterian Church Clapham, where his sacred cantata The Prince of Peace had its first performance. He was in 1920 appointed organist and choirmaster of Ealing Presbyterian Church, and in that year his cantata Excalibur was performed in London. In 1903 King Arthur was performed at the Royalty Theatre, London. In the same year his opera in four acts, The Cross and the Crescent, first produced at Covent Garden by the Moody-Manners company, won him the Manners Prize of ¬£250 for the best opera by a British composer,Hubbard and Krehbiel p.348 and it was performed subsequently in Glasgow and Edinburgh. A one-act opera The Vow staged at the Theatre Royal, Nottingham won him the same prize twelve years later. His writings included critical essays published in journals The Musical Times and The Musical Quarterly, and his book Hermaia: a Study in Comparative Esthetics, which his biographer David J. Fisher describes as \\"a remarkable study of comparative aesthetics\\", has been recognised as culturally important. In 1907 McAlpin had his portrait painted by Richard Jack RA, and a bronze bust was sculpted by W. B. Fagan FRBS. He married an artist Susette Peach (1871-1950) in 1899, and they had one son Roderic McAlpin (1907-1965). Colin McAlpin died at Dorking, Surrey, on 13 May 1942.\\"Major events in the life of Colin McAlpin\\", by David J.

Plot Boston Blackie's (Chester Morris) wealthy friend, Arthur Manleder (Lloyd Corrigan), purchases an upscale bookstore from aged Wilfred Kittredge (George M. Carleton), but retains his services as a book expert. However, when Kittredge becomes ill just before an important auction he was to conduct, Blackie proves that he can impersonate him, fooling everyone, including Police Inspector Farraday (Richard Lane). With the assistance of store employee Gloria (Lynn Merrick), Blackie runs the auction without a hitch. The centerpiece is a rare first edition of Charles Dickens' Pickwick Papers, which goes for $62,000. However, the purchaser discovers that the book is a fake and demands his money back. $50,000 had already been sent to the book's owner/forger, Porter Hadley. Blackie tracks him down, but arrives just too late. Hadley's partner, Gloria, finds him packed and ready to leave. She shoots him and takes the money. Blackie hears the gunfire, forcing her to flee; in her haste, the money gets stuck in the other doorway. Blackie takes the envelope of cash. By sheer bad timing, Farraday and Sergeant Matthews (Frank Sully) arrive while Blackie is examining Hadley's body, and arrest him for murder. Blackie has little difficulty escaping. Still unaware of the identity of the real murderer, he takes Gloria into his confidence. He puts the money in the store's safe while she watches with interest. That night, she and her husband, escaped safecracker Jack Higgins (Steve Cochran), break into the shop, but are forced to leave without the cash when Blackie and Arthur arrive. When Jack arranges to meet Blackie, Blackie recognizes him. He agrees to give Higgins half the proceeds, but Blackie's sidekick \\"the Runt\\" (George E. Stone) informs Gloria that he will not be bringing real cash, and that the $50,000 is stashed in Arthur's home safe. Jack and an accomplice tie Blackie up. Jack then leaves to get the money. Blackie gets free, phones Farraday and heads to Arthur's suite. There, he and the Runt capture and bind Jack. Then Blackie forces Gloria to write out a confession, convincing her how coldblooded he can be by pretending to shoot her husband dead (the unseen Runt just knocks him out). Jack regains consciousness and control of the situation, allowing Gloria to burn her confession. When Farraday and his men break in, Blackie presents the inspector with a blank sheet of paper, claiming he switched the pages. Gloria incriminates herself and is arrested and taken away with her husband, Jack Higgins.

Created in 1830, it is currently part of the permanent collection in the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Description In the foreground, there is a boat, floating down the Avon River, right outside Bristol. There is a second boat, further down the river, nearer to the action of the painting. The dark, rocky cliffs on the left are juxtaposed with the light, sheer cliffs on the right, creating a deep contrast for the centre, where the river runs through. The subject of the painting, not in the foreground, is a chunk of limestone being blown off the cliff face, in preparation for the construction of the Clifton Suspension Bridge. Historical information The subject matter was given to Cotman by his friend and patron, Reverend James Bulwer, who lived in Bristol. The view is believed to be one of the last views from this popular vantage point, as the view was lost in 1831, when construction of the Clifton Suspension Bridge started. Cotman's style of watercolor varied from his contemporaries, opting to use watercolors like paint, instead of a tint. He used the paints in unique ways, using the translucent quality of the medium to his full advantage. =Acquisition= The Indianapolis Museum of Art purchased Blasting St. Vincent's Rock in 1999, using the Beeler Fund, the Mr. and Mrs. Spurlock Fund and James E.

Until recently, little was known of his life.See, for example, Matulka, p.xvi. Representative of a class of late medieval \\"humanist knights\\",Gerli. he was associated with the court of Garc√≠a √Ålvarez de Toledo, 1st Duke of Alba and may have been the nephew of the noble Pedro Alvarez Osorio.Gerli. In 1476, he was appointed official chronicler to the monarchs Fernando and Isabella;Gerli. among his other political activities, he may have participated in the civil war of the 1470s and in Grenada.Gerli. He was \\"one of the most widely read Spanish authors in Europe\\",Matulka, page x. unmatched until Miguel de Cervantes started writing 60 years after de Flores died, and the European popularity of his Grisel y Mirabella (which had at least 56 editions in several languages before Cervantes was born)Matulka, p.xi. was on a par with Diego de San Pedro's C√°rcel de amor and Fernando de Rojas's La Celestina.Matulka, p.xi. Works =Grimalte y Gradissa= The work presents itself as a kind of sequel to Giovanni Boccaccio's Elegia di Madonna Fiammetta: a Spanish young lady, Gradissa, is heart-broken over the fate of Boccaccio's Lady Fiammetta (presented as a real person), and she decides to reject the advances of all men, including her noble lover Grimalte. This latter decides to search out Lady Fiammetta, and eventually discovers her. He attempts to reconcile Fiammetta and her lover Panfilo, but is unsuccessful. Fiammetta dies and Panfilo promises to retreat from the world and seek out the wilds of the forest. Grimalte returns to his love Gradissa to attempt his own reconciliation, but she convinces him to seek out Panfilo once more. Grimalte does this, finding Panfilo alone and silent in the forest, and in his turn Grimalte becomes a wild man of the woods, haunted by visions of Fiammetta in hell.Reynier, p.86-90. =Grisel y Mirabella= The story is as follows: The King of Scotland has a daughter, Mirabella (Isabella in other versions), whom he loves so much, that he rejects all suitors for her hand and locks her up in his palace. A young noble, Grisel (Aurelio in other versions) is, however, able to find his way to her and they fall in love. Denounced by a servant, they are both imprisoned, and the king decides to judge them according to a law dictating that the person found more culpable is to be put to death, while the other is to be exiled. When the lovers, under torture, each refuse to inculpate the other, the king decides to organize a judicial debate, the cause of women to be defended by a certain Bra√ßayda (Hortensia in other versions), and the cause of men by a certain Torrellas (Afranio in other versions). After a lengthy debate, the judges find women to be more guilty, and Mirabella is sentenced to be burnt at the stake. As the bonfire is prepared, her lover Grisel throws himself in the fire and the public stops all further action, claiming God has chosen his victim. That night, however, Mirabella throws herself in her father's courtyard to be devoured by his lions. Finally: in an act of vengeance for the death of her daughter, the queen has a false letter sent to the vain Torrellas, the \\"champion of men\\", supposedly by the hand of Bra√ßayda, proclaiming Bra√ßayda's interest in him and inviting him to a secret rendez-vous. At this tryst, the queen and her maidens surprise the man, bind him, gruesomely torture him all night, and finally kill him.Reynier, p.77-83. The early portion of the story has similarities to a tale in Boccaccio's Decameron (\\"The story of Guiscardo and Ghismonda\\", day four, first tale),Matulka, p.45. while the debate on love and a woman or man's guilt echoes a long tradition in late medieval and early Renaissance texts. =El Triunfo de Amor= Juan de Flores is also author of an allegorical vision story, El Triunfo de Amor (The Triumph of Love): Cupid is captured by angry dead lovers and, after a trial, is sentenced to death. He is, however, saved by his supporters, and in return Cupid reverses the roles of love in the sexes, making men virtuous and chaste and making women the ones imploring them for sex.Gerli. =Other works= Three other works have been attributed to Juan de Flores with some certainty:Gerli, for the following. * an epistolary exchange between Tristan and Isolde; * a royal chronicle, Cr√≥nica incompleta de los Reyes Cat√≥licos; * La coronaci√≥n de la se√±ora Gracisla, a work on consolation relating the tale of a maiden at a beauty contest. Translations and influence Grisel y Mirabella was translated into Italian (1521) as Historia de Aurelio et Isabel by a certain \\"Lelio Aletiphilo\\";Matulka, p.169.Reynier, p.76. this translation gave the work a wide dissemination. Grisel y Mirabella was translated into French (1530) as Le Jugement d'Amour or as Histoire d'Aurelio et d'Isabelle.Reynier, p.77. De Flores's novel was popular in England, and had been published in English translation five times between 1556 and 1586. It was one of the sources for Women Pleased, a late Jacobean-era stage play, a tragicomedy, by John Fletcher (1647). Grimalte y Gradissa was translated into French in 1535 by Maurice Sc√®ve as La D√©plourable fin de Flamecte. The influence of Grisel y Mirabella can be seen in Lope de Vega's work La Ley Ejecutada.

Plot The narrator first starts out as a feral Beagle/German Shepherd/terrier mix puppy. A few weeks later, after being nursed by their mother, a feral as well, the dog and his siblings Fast, Sister, and Hungry go outside of their den to explore the woods around them. Soon after, men come and capture them. The dogs arrive at a place called the Yard, where dozens of abandoned dogs reside under the guidance of a gentle old woman whom the narrator calls Se√±ora. The narrator, named Toby by Se√±ora, adjusts to his new lifestyle. One day, many of the newer dogs at the Yard are whisked off to a building (a veterinarian office). A new dog arrives, named Spike, who is very aggressive towards the other dogs. Not long after, animal control agents arrive with orders to shut down the place due to poor sanitation and welfare conditions. Many dogs, including Toby, are subsequently euthanized. Toby is reincarnated as a Golden Retriever puppy and is nursing from a new mother. A few weeks after birth, when Toby and his new brothers and sisters have matured enough, he and the others are allowed to play outside the cage. Toby climbs up onto a table and bites the doorknob, opening the gate to the outside world and leaving him to explore the real world. A truck driver picks up Toby on the road and calls him \\"Fella.\\" The man drives to a bar. After the man has been gone for several hours, Toby begins suffering from heat exhaustion in the cab. However, a woman appears and breaks the car window. She revives Toby with water from a water bottle. The woman brings him to her car and returns home. The woman introduces Toby, renamed Bailey, to her eight-year-old son, Ethan, who is overjoyed to have a puppy of his own. Over the summer, Bailey enjoys himself, playing with Ethan every day. Bailey becomes accustomed to Ethan's school routine and the summer tradition of going to the Farm, where Ethan's grandparents live. Bailey ends up causing trouble at both houses. Over the course of many years, Bailey lives a full life with Ethan. He accompanies Ethan through many difficulties, including arson, causing a permanently injured leg, ending Ethan's athletic career. Ethan goes to live with his grandparents at their farm in Michigan so he can be with his girlfriend Hannah and finish his senior year in high school. Around that time, things are not going well in the family, with Ethan's injury, an eventual breakup with Hannah, and a divorce between Ethan's parents. Soon after moving, Ethan goes off to college, leaving Bailey with infrequent visits from him during the holidays. Bailey's health starts to decline, with him taking naps very often and being weak. Soon, Ethan's mother and grandparents take him to the vet, where he is once again put down. Bailey wakes up once again as a German Shepherd. Bailey, who realizes that he is now a girl, is picked out and named Ellie by a police officer, named Jakob, and trained to be a search-and-rescue dog. Jakob and Ellie find a kidnapped girl but while getting the man into custody he shoots Jakob, injuring him so that he can no longer be a policeman. Ellie then gets put into the care of one of Jakob's colleagues, Maya. After passing of old age, he is reborn but this time as a Labrador Retriever with Wendi, his new owner, who is ecstatic with Bailey, whom she renames Bear. However, she is unable to keep him because of a no-pet rule in her apartment building. Instead, she gives him to her mother, who is dating an alcoholic. The mother's boyfriend, fed up with the dog upon receiving a notice that he needs to provide better living conditions, ditches him on a country road. Bear recognizes his surroundings, having been there before with Ethan. Using the skills he learned as Ellie, Bear is able to trail the scent of one of the farm's animals to the Farm, where Ethan lives.

He is considered to be one of the most important figures in the military history of modern Greece. He is considered to have had a decisive role in the Battle of Bizani during the First Balkan War (1912‚Äì1913), forcing the Ottoman Army to surrender unconditionally. Early life and career Velissariou was born in Ploie»ôti, Romania, to Greek parents from Evia. He spent much of his boyhood in Ploie»ôti. At the age of 19 he joined the Greek Army as a volunteer, while in 1887 he was promoted to Second Lieutenant of Infantry. He acquired his first experience in combat during the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, where he distinguished himself at the battles of Melouna and Derven-Fourkas, covering the Greek positions. In the following years he was posted as gendarmerie commander in the island of Skopelos and in 1909 he participated in the Goudi military coup. First Balkan War With the outbreak of the Balkan Wars, Velissariou was appointed commander in the 3rd Battalion of the 4th Infantry Regiment. At the Battle of Sarantaporo he managed to advance rapidly with his unit against the Ottoman forces and cut their withdrawal, causing general unrest to the enemy. After Sarantaporo he was placed as commander in the 9th Battalion of the 1st Evzone Regiment. Velissariou then was transferred to the Epirus front and was deployed at the east flank, in Aetorachi sector. On February 19, 1913, the Greek headquarters ordered a general attack against the Ottoman fortifications in Bizani, which covered the city of Ioannina. The Evzone battalions of Velissariou and Georgios Iatridis penetrated rapidly north and managed to cut off the only escape route of the enemy troops with the capture of the village of Aghios Ioannis, between Bizani and Ioannina. Soon the Ottoman headquarters in Ioannina, was unable to transmit any communication message to the Ottoman forts, causing major panic.Gedeon (1998), p. 196 At the following night the units of Velissariou and Iatridis managed to capture 37 officers and 935 soldiers in their attempt to withdraw north. As a result, the next day, the Ottoman commander Esad Pasha surrendered, while Velissariou personally led the Ottoman delegation to the Greek headquarters.Gedeon (1998), p. 198 Second Balkan War Painting depicting the battle of Summit 1378, with Velissariou pictured right, among the Evzones. Velissariou participated in the Second Balkan War against Greece's erstwhile ally Bulgaria, initially in the Battle of Lahanas and then in the Battle of Kresna Gorge. After the Greek Army managed to break through the Kresna pass, it captured the town of Simitli, while the battalion of Velissariou, together with other two of the 1st Evzone Regiment, fought at Summit 1378, northeast of Simitli. Although the specific sector suffered constant attacks by the Bulgarian Army, the Evzones managed to repel them. During the conflict of 13‚Äì15 July, the Regiment suffered numerous casualties; Major Velissariou was one of the officers killed.Gedeon (1998), p. 259 He was buried near the battle site.

Instead, however, Gildo proved as execrable a tyrant as his brother, and ruled the province with the iron hand of a despot during twelve long years, in which the Roman government could not muster the will or moral courage to bring him to account.Gibbon, p. 1040 When Theodosius died in 395 and the empire was divided between his sons into East and west, Africa became a part of the western Empire, nominally ruled by Honorius, but really by his energetic and conscientious Vandal minister, Stilicho. Since the latter was not likely to continue tolerating Gildo's abuse, the latter decided to deliver his allegiance to the eastern empire of Arcadius, who, under the influence of his favorite Eutropius, was hostile to Stilicho, and eager to detract from his possessions.Gibbon, p. 1041  African command  Meanwhile, Gildo had fallen out with his younger brother Mascezel, who was forced to flee to Italy for protection, while Gildo ordered the execution of his wife and children at home.Gibbon, p. 1042 Stilicho, who was in search of an able subordinate to lead the expedition to recover Africa from the treacherous Gildo, immediately enrolled Mascezel into his service, entrusting him with the command of the 5,000 Roman legionnaires allocated to put down the revolt. His superior capability, according to a contemporary panegyrist (Claudian), combined with the discipline of the Roman soldiery, secured Mascezel a prompt and easy victory.Gibbon, p. 1043, 1044 According to Paulinus of Milan, Ambrose of Milan appeared to Mascazel in a dream and assured him of his success against his brother. Gildo was defeated in an almost bloodless engagement shortly after Mascezel's landing, and committed suicide in prison after being captured in his flight from the field of battle.Gibbon, p. 1044  Death  After the initial applause which greeted his victory, Mascezel quickly fell out of favor in the court of Honorius.Gibbon, p. 1045 Zosimus described his death as follows:  Sources  *Claudian, The War against Gildo *Paulinus of Milan, The Life of St. Ambrose of Milan *Orosius, History against the Pagans *Zosimus, New History  References  Category:4th-century Romans Category:Roman rebels Category:398 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown Category:4th-century Berber people ","title":"Mascezel"},{"id":"35739040","text":"Rachel Woods (born 15 April 1989) is a Northern Irish politician who has been the Green Party MLA for North Down since 7 October 2019, replacing the party's former leader, Steven Agnew.

The regions of the brain that are involved in language in humans have similar analogues in apes and monkeys, and yet they do not use language. There may also be a genetic component: mutations in the FOXP2 gene prevent humans from constructing complete sentences.  Neurobiological adaptations for language  = Broca's and Wernicke's areas = These regions are where language is located in the brain ‚Äì everything from speech to reading and writing. Language itself is based on symbols used to represent concepts in the world, and this system appears to be housed in these areas. The language regions in human brains highly resemble similar regions in other primates, even though humans are the only species that use language. The brain structures of chimps are very similar to those of humans. Both contain Broca's and Wernicke's homologues that are involved in communication. Broca's area is largely used for planning and producing vocalizations in both chimps and humans. Wernicke's area appears to be where linguistic representations and symbols are mapped to specific concepts. This functionality is present in both chimps and humans; the chimp Wernicke's area is much more similar to its human counterpart than is the Broca's area, suggesting that Wernicke's is more evolutionary ancient than Broca's. = Motor neurons = Sagittal section of human vocal tract In order to speak, the breathing system must be voluntarily repurposed to produce vocal sounds, which allows the breathing mechanisms to be temporarily deactivated in favor of song or speech production. The human vocal tract has evolved to be more suited to speaking, with a lower larynx, 90¬∞ turn in the windpipe, and large, round tongue. Motor neurons in birds and humans bypass the unconscious systems in the brainstem to give direct control of the larynx to the brain.  Theories of language origin  = Gestural origin = The earliest language was strictly vocal; reading and writing came later. New research suggests that the combination of gestures and vocalizations may have led to the development of more complicated language in protohumans. Chimps that produce attention-getting sounds show activation in areas of the brain that are highly similar to Broca's area in humans. Even hand and mouth movements with no vocalizations cause very similar activation patterns in the Broca's area of both humans and monkeys. When monkeys view other monkeys gesturing, mirror neurons in the Broca's homologue activate. Groups of mirror neurons are specialized to respond only to one kind of viewed action, and it is currently believed that these may be an evolutionary origin to the neurons that are adapted for speech processing and production. = Universal grammar = The language bioprogram hypothesis proposes that humans have an innate, cognitive grammatical structure allowing them to develop and understand language. According to this theory, this system is embedded in human genetics and underpins the basic grammar of all languages. Some evidence suggests that at least some of our linguistic capacities may be genetically controlled. Mutations in the FOXP2 gene prevent people from combining words and phrases into sentences. However, these genes are present in the heart, lungs, and brain, and their role is not entirely clear. It is possible that the human capacity for grammar evolved from non-semantic behavior like singing. Birds have the ability to produce, process, and learn complex vocalizations, but the units of a birdsong, when removed from the larger meaning and context of the birdsong as a whole, have no inherent meaning. Early hominids may have evolved capacities for similar, non-semantic purposes, that were later modified for symbolic language.

Milonguero is a term for a skillful and respectful tango dancer who holds a reverence for the type of traditional social tango that is danced at milongas in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The two uses of the term do not coincide: many dancers who are considered to be milongueros do not dance milonguero-style tango. Origin Gustavo Naveira and Giselle Anne Milonguero-style tango, also known as estilo milonguero (in Buenos Aires, known by name Estilo del centro because it originates from downtown milongas where dance floors were crowded) or apilado (piled up, stacked), is a close-embrace style of social tango dancing in which the focus is inward and the leg and arm movements are kept small. The style developed from and is appropriate to crowded dance floors. The term was coined by Buenos Aires-born tango dancer Susana Miller in the 1990s in the process of teaching others the kind of inwardly focused tango dancing that was practiced by veteran dancers in the social dance venues of central Buenos Aires, differentiating it from the more pronounced movements of outer Buenos Aires and other less crowded milongas, and especially to separate it from choreographed stage tango. Style In the milonguero-style embrace, the woman moves her left hand past her partner's right shoulder (where it would be in open embrace) around his neck and back to end up near his left shoulder, depending on the relative heights of the dancers. Her left arm will lie above the man's right arm with no space between them, but she will not hold tension in that arm‚Äîhe should barely feel the weight of her arm. The two faces may touch, they will at least be very close. With a straight back she leans against her partner at a more pronounced angle than his; he leans slightly toward her but may appear to be standing upright. Rhythmically, the two will indulge in small adornments with the feet until just before the next beat, changing weight at the last possible moment. Barbara Garvey, the co- founder of the Bay Area Tango Association based in San Francisco, said that she and her husband Al saw in 1987 that \\"a very simple form of close embrace was prevalent in the center of [Buenos Aires], but not in other barrios.\\" This style was expanded upon by Pedro \\"Tete\\" Rusconi who was the first to teach close embrace in the US, joined by Susana Miller who gave the style its name. In 1994, Daniel Trenner taught at Stanford University's Tango Week, describing the Rusconi/Miller milonguero style as the only authentic Buenos Aires tango. From the late 1980s, a sense of tango community had been growing in the San Francisco Bay Area, and after '94 it adopted an emphasis on milonguero style, along with other forms of close embrace. By the late-1990s a milonga could be found in San Francisco on any night of the week.Cusumano 2008, p. 38 Traveling tango performers would appear at the dance venues after their shows, but they would change from show attire and style to salon-style dancing and more conservative clothing. However, from around 1996 when Madonna was in Buenos Aires making the film Evita, women's dress at milongas grew more sheer and revealing. Also in the late 1990s but in Athens, the term tango milonguero came to represent a movement to recreate in Greece a sense of \\"authentic\\" Buenos Aires, with tango aficionados organizing Argentine-style milongas and encouraging a sense of community among the dancers. Relative to other styles of tango, milonguero style is sometimes viewed as restrictive and limiting, especially in the context of tango nuevo which emphasizes playful exploration and freedom of movement.Klein 2009, pp. 70‚Äì71. On the other hand, milonguero- style dancers may regard with suspicion the nuevo-style introduction of electronic and other non-traditional music to the dance floor. Milongueros decry the sort of exhibitionism demonstrated by large movements and showy dance figures. Nevertheless, some practitioners and teachers have combined milonguero elements with a nuevo outlook to create milonguero nuevo, a blend that is safe for crowded dance floors yet full of playful interaction between the two partners.

The largest source of water pollution in India is untreated sewage. Other sources of pollution include agricultural runoff and unregulated small-scale industry. Most rivers, lakes and surface water in India are polluted due to industries, untreated sewage and solid wastes. The issues = Untreated Sewage = A 2007 study found that discharge of untreated sewage is the single most important source of pollution of surface and ground water in India. There is a large gap between generation and treatment of domestic waste water in India. The problem is not only that India lacks sufficient treatment capacity but also that the sewage treatment plants that exist do not operate and are not maintained. The majority of the government-owned sewage treatment plants remain closed most of the time due to improper design or poor maintenance or lack of reliable electricity supply to operate the plants, together with absentee employees and poor management. The waste water generated in these areas normally percolates into the soil or evaporates. The uncollected waste accumulates in the urban areas causing unhygienic conditions and releasing pollutants that leach into surface and groundwater. A 1992 World Health Organization study reported that out of India's 3,119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial sewage treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities. Downstream, the river water polluted by the untreated water is used for drinking, bathing, and washing. A 1995 report claimed 114 Indian cities were dumping untreated sewage and partially cremated bodies directly into the Ganges River.National Geographic Society. 1995. Water: A Story of Hope. Washington (DC): National Geographic Society Lack of toilets and sanitation facilities causes open defecation in rural and urban pill areas of India, like many developing countries.Fast Facts - Sanitation World Health Organization (2012) This is a source of surface water pollution. thumb Sewage discharged from cities, towns and some villages is the predominant cause of water pollution in India. Investment is needed to bridge the gap between sewage India generates and its treatment capacity of sewage per day. Major cities of India produce 38,354 million litres per day (MLD) of sewage, but the urban sewage treatment capacity is only 11,786 MLD. A large number of Indian rivers are severely polluted as a result of discharge of domestic sewage. The Central Pollution Control Board,a Ministry of Environment & Forests Government of India entity, has established a National Water Quality Monitoring Network comprising 1,429 monitoring stations in 28 states and 6 in Union Territories on various rivers and water bodies across the country. This effort monitors water quality year round. The monitoring network covers 293 rivers, 94 lakes, 9 tanks, 41 ponds, 8 creeks, 23 canals, 18 drains and 411 wells distributed across India. Water samples are routinely analysed for 28 parameters including dissolved oxygen, bacteriological and other internationally established parameters for water quality. Additionally 9 trace metals parameters and 28 pesticide residues are analysed. Biomonitoring is also carried out on specific locations. The scientific analysis of water samples from 1995 to 2008 indicates that the organic and bacterial contamination is severe in water bodies of India. This is mainly due to discharge of domestic waste water in untreated form, mostly from the urban centres of India. = Organic matter = In 2010 the water quality monitoring found almost all rivers with high levels of BOD (a measure of pollution with organic matter). The worst pollution, in decreasing order, were found in river Markanda (490 mg/l BOD), followed by river Kali (364), river Amlakhadi (353), Yamuna canal (247), river Yamuna at Delhi (70) and river Betwa (58). For context, a water sample with a 5-day BOD between 1 and 2 mg O/L indicates a very clean water, 3 to 8 mg O/L indicates a moderately clean water, 8 to 20 indicates borderline water, and greater than 20 mg O/L indicates ecologically-unsafe, polluted water. The levels of BOD are severe near the cities and major towns. In rural parts of India, the river BOD levels were sufficient to support aquatic life.Kaur et al., Wastewater production, treatment and use in India UN Water (Publisher) = Coliform levels = Rivers Yamuna, Ganga, Gomti, Ghaghara River, Chambal, Mahi, Vardha and Godavari, are amongst the other most coliform polluted water bodies in India. For context, coliform must be below 104 MPN/100 ml, preferably absent from water for it to be considered safe for general human use, and for irrigation where coliform may cause disease outbreak from contaminated-water in agriculture. In 2006, 47 percent of water quality monitoring reported coliform concentrations above 500 MPN/100 ml. During 2008, 33 percent of all water quality monitoring stations reported a total coliform levels exceeding those levels, suggesting recent effort to add pollution control infrastructure and upgrade treatment plants in India, may be reversing the water pollution trend. Treatment of domestic sewage and subsequent utilization of treated sewage for irrigation can prevent pollution of water bodies, reduce the demand for fresh water in the irrigation sector and become a resource for irrigation. Since 2005, Indian wastewater treatment plant market has been growing annually at the rate of 10 to 12 percent. The United States is the largest supplier of treatment equipment and supplies to India, with 40 percent market share of new installation. At this rate of expansion, and assuming the government of India continues on its path of reform, major investments in sewage treatment plants and electricity infrastructure development, India will nearly triple its water treatment capacity by 2015, and treatment capacity supply will match India's daily sewage water treatment requirements by about 2020.  The Solution  Water conservation in India is gaining pace. The Ganga rejuvenation efforts by the union government, the Yamuna clean up are some of the government initiated efforts. http://mowr.gov.in/schemes-projects-programmes/programmes/ganga- rejuvenation The Chennai River Restoration trust's efforts to clean the Cooum, Adyar rivers in Chennai and civil society efforts spearheaded by organizations like Environmentalist Foundation of India (E.F.I) to clean lakes and ponds in the country are seen as significant development towards water conservation. https://www.thebetterindia.com/99349/environmentalist- foundation-of-india-fundraiser/ = Other problems = A joint study by PGIMER and the Punjab Pollution Control Board in 2008, revealed that in villages along the Nullah, fluoride, mercury, beta-endosulphan and heptachlor pesticide were more than permissible limit (MPL) in ground and tap water. Plus the water had high concentration of COD and BOD (chemical and biochemical oxygen demand), ammonia, phosphate, chloride, chromium, arsenic and chlorpyrifos pesticide. The ground water also contains nickel and selenium, while the tap water has high concentration of lead, nickel and cadmium. Flooding during monsoons worsens India's water pollution problem, as it washes and moves solid waste and contaminated soils into its rivers and wetlands. The annual average precipitation in India is about 4000 billion cubic metres. From this, with the state of Indian infrastructure in 2005, the available water resource through the rivers is about 1869 billion cubic meters. Accounting to uneven distribution of rain over the country each year, water resources available for utilization, including ground water, is claimed to be about 1122 billion cubic meters. Much of this water is unsafe, because pollution degrades water quality. Water pollution severely limits the amount of water available to Indian consumers, its industry and its agriculture.

Facts The Basingstoke Canal Co gave Hill an exclusive contractual licence in his lease of Aldershot Wharf, Cottage and Boathouse to hire boats out. Hill did so regularly. Mr Tupper also occasionally allowed customers to use his boats by his Aldershot Inn to bathe or fish in the canal. Hill wished to stop Tupper from doing so. He sued Tupper, arguing that his lease gave him an exclusive easement and so a direct right to enforce it against third parties (rather than mere licence).Judgment at bailii.org Judgment Pollock CB held that the contract did not create any legal property right, and so there was no duty on Mr Tupper. If Hill wanted to stop Tupper, he would have to force the Canal Company to assert its property right against Tupper. An easement would not be recognised.(1863) 2 H & C 121, 127 The benefit of an easement must be for the land.

It persuasively confirmed for one of the first times, obiter, that parking a car on land on its own could be the appropriate subject matter for an express easement. It established that an arrangement for a future extension of easement rights over specific other land would require a specific parcel of dominant land too. Simply agreeing that wherever any dominant land is extended (to an incertain extent) the easement on the servient land will be extended (even to a certain degree) is insufficient. Facts The Leicestershire branch of the Co-op sold part of its land to London and Blenheim (\\"L&B;\\") but reserving the right to park cars on the land (i.e. reserving of rights by the Co-op). The agreement provided that if L&B; were to acquire \\"more land\\" or words to that effect, it should tell the Co-op in advance so Co-op could benefit from more parking rights on a pre-agreed basis. Then the Co-op sold its land to Ladbroke. L&B; argued it could serve notice on Ladbroke in place of Co-op (and attempted to do so), L&B; having acquired new land; secondly it denied it now owned further servient land to accommodate Ladbroke's claimed interests under the contract with Co-op. In its view Ladbroke did not have a further easement (rights to bind L&B; to grant more parking) and could not have an easement in the first place. Ladbroke countered that even L&B; were bound by the agreement as it expressly created easements; the fact that its future enhanced parking rights related to uncertain land (therefore in specie) was not an invalid concept in law. Judgment =High Court= Judge Paul Baker QC held the following.[1993] 1 All ER 307, 317 =Court of Appeal= Peter Gibson LJ gave the leading judgment, he agreed that L&B; could not claim a car parking right for additional land, because the alleged dominant tenement was not adequately identified. The reason why there must be a dominant tenement before there can be a grant is because certainty is of prime importance, as said in Ashburn Anstalt v Arnold, a case which concerned a proposed expensive new development in South Kensington.[1993] 4 All ER 157, 163h See also *English land law *English trusts law *English property law References Category:English land case law Category:1993 in case law Category:1993 in British law Category:Court of Appeal (England and Wales) cases ","title":"London and Blenheim Estates Ltd v Ladbroke Retail Parks Ltd"},{"id":"35739376","text":"Andy Roddick was the defending champion, but lost in the quarterfinals.

To honor his major scientific medical contributions, Beh√ßet's disease is often called Adamantiades‚ÄìBeh√ßet's disease after him. Life and scientific contributions He was born to Fotios Adamantiades a teacher in Bursa in Ottoman empire. He became orphaned in an early age and raised by his uncle a metropolitan in Thrace and Turkey. He completed his high school studies in the Illustrious School of the Nation where he graduate with excellent grades in 1892. Then he visited Athens with the intent of becoming an engineer, but the Polytechnic of Athens had stopped its enrollments by the time he got there, so he enrolled in the Medical School instead. He returned in the Ottoman Empire where he practiced as a general practitioner from 1896 until 1911, Then he would travel to Paris where he would specialize in ophthalmology in the hospitals of Quinze Vingt and H√¥tel Dieu until 1914. Upon his return he was drafted by the Ottoman Army because of the outbreak of the First World War. He remained drafted for one year and he was released due to a severe gastrointestinal disease. After the Greco-Turkish War of 1920 he was one of the refugees to come to Greece. There he was appointed head of the Ophthalmology Department of Hippocration Hospital ‚Äì then known as Athens Refugee Hospital ‚Äì in Athens, where he developed significant scientific activities. During the annual meeting of the Medical Society of Athens on November 15, 1930, Adamantiades presented \\"A case of relapsing iritis with hypopyon\\"Adamantiades B. A case of relapsing iritis with hypopyon (in Greek). Archeia Iatrikis Etairias (Proceedings of the Medical Society of Athens) 1930:586‚Äì93 identifying the three major signs of the so-called Adamantiades‚ÄìBeh√ßet's disease and insisting on a single clinical entity. In the same year, his lecture was published in the Proceedings of the Medical Society of Athens, and in 1931 in the French journal Annales d'Oculistique. In the year 1946, Adamantiades defined thrombophlebitis as the 4th major sign of the disease. Later, he presented the first classification of the disease by describing the ocular, mucocutaneous and systemic forms in a review work. He pointed out that the disease can occur for years as a monosymptomatic or oligosymptomatic disorder and that eye involvement and severe prognosis are more common in men than in women. In this work he also proposed the first diagnostic criteria. In addition to Adamantiades‚ÄìBeh√ßet's disease, Adamantiades described the interstitial keratitis in trachomatic patients to be a bacterial infection and classified the epidemic idiopathic hemeralopia. Further pioneer works were those on the marginal corneal degeneration, the posterior vitreous detachment, the measurement of the optic fundi and of the ocular pressure as well as investigations on trachoma, uveitis and the pathogenesis of glaucoma. Adamantiades compiled over 200 scientific papers (mostly in Greek and in French) many of which marked a new stage in his field. He also had a small contribution in the Center of Asia Minor Studies in Athens. He got married in an advanced age and his adopted daughter Ourania Ragkavi became the first female ophthalmologist in Greece.

Facts The company, Linden Mews Ltd, was formed by certain residents of Linden Mews in Notting Hillhttp://www.achurchnearyou.com/church/15543/ Anglican Parish Church of St Matthew, Notting Hill, map to buy the road, where in places the residents regularly historically parked on average one car per house which was all the space available. The exception was nos. 4 and 5 who owned a small garden as separate parcels of land (tenements) for parking beyond the end of the road since 1988 and in 1998 opened up part of the wall, affixing substantial gates to access it more easily. These two residents claimed an easement, and the company counterclaimed trespass seeking an injunction (and failing which an agreement to refrain from parking in the residents' yards at the end of the road in favour of their accepting its proposed levy of parking charges on the road it owned).http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/590.html The company said/argued: #Anything more, for free, than disembarking and unloading in front of their properties was not acceptable to it. #Hypothetically it would allow free access into any garage in any of the houses own plots, were such to exist. #It would require the payment by the various owners of substantial sums for them to park on the [i.e. its] carriageway. #Access of the far two residents' individual plots/\\"parking spaces\\" via the road would break the general principle in Harris v Flower, reaffirmed in Alvis v Harrison (1991) against the implied enlargement of easements not for a change of use of land but rather for additional parcels of land. The two households argued: #Their easement by prescription (passage of time) to access their homes extended to the plots they owned at the end of the road, which they had later acquired. In the court below the judge in the Central London County Court found strongly for the private road company, granting them a restrictive injunction against Das and the other neighbour. Judgment Buxton LJ gave the substantive judgment with which the fellow two judges agreed. He held there was no easement for parking, but the judge had been wrong to award an injunction, and should have considered whether damages in lieu would have been more appropriate, and how much. The case was remitted back to the trial judge for a fresh exercise of his discretion as to whether an injunction should be granted following the guidelines set down by the Court of Appeal. The panel of three judges agreed a dominant owner (the residents) could only as of right use a right of way granted (or relying its period of exercise for obtaining it \\"by prescription\\") for the enjoyment and for the purposes of the dominant tenement. They could not use it for the additional land they acquired. The only automatically permissible enlargement of the dominant tenement would be an expansion of business, otherwise an express grant of easement would need to be negotiated, such as at a market price.

He played minor league baseball in the Tampa Bay Devil Rays (now Rays) organization in 2001. Standing at and weighing , Nash received his nickname due to his size 18 (US) shoes. A high school dropout, Nash was discovered by the Devil Rays while playing in a semi- professional league in Sorrento, Louisiana. His life story seemed so improbable that baseball executives at first thought Nash was a hoax, similar to Sidd Finch. Despite his natural ability, compared to Babe Ruth, and the fictional Roy Hobbs character from The Natural, Nash's legal troubles shortened his professional career. Biography Nash is from Sorrento, Louisiana. His mother abandoned him when he was 12 years old, and his father Charles \\"Tuttie\\" Payton raised him along with his younger sister Joanna in a trailer home. Payton taught Nash to hit as a child using old socks and bottle caps in lieu of baseballs. He was expelled from two schools for fighting, and later dropped out of school altogether after being suspended for a fight in the eighth grade. In 1994 at the age of 12, Nash played in the Dixie Youth Tournament, a Little League tournament in Hammond, Louisiana. Standing and weighing , he struck out 17 of 21 batters he faced with a fastball, and hit two home runs. Tampa Bay Devil Rays scout Benny Latino, a former college player at Southeastern Louisiana University whose hometown is Hammond, watched the game, and made a note to look for Nash in the future, assuming he would be a star in high school. As he did not attend high school, however, Nash fell into obscurity and Latino spent seven years looking for him. In lieu of a high school education, Nash went to work in his cousin's sugar cane fields at age 16 along with his father. He played in exhibitions against local high schools and in a semi-professional baseball league, and attended an open tryout for the Pittsburgh Pirates. At the age of 18, Latino found Nash playing in this semi-pro league, known as the Sugar Cane League, featuring amateurs and ex- minor leaguers. In a game in Tangipahoa, the scout witnessed Toe hitting home runs from both sides of the plate, and throwing from the mound. The Devil Rays brought Nash to their minor league camp in Princeton, West Virginia, for a workout in front of scouting director Dan Jennings. Nash pitched in the high 80s, topping out at . He also hit towering home runs, drawing comparisons to Yankee legend Babe Ruth for his power. After Nash went undrafted in the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft, the Devil Rays signed him for a $30,000 signing bonus. He was assigned to their fall instructional league, where he played in the outfield alongside Josh Hamilton and Carl Crawford. Nash's agent, Larry Reynolds, introduced Nash to his brother Harold Reynolds, an ESPN analyst and former major league infielder, who invited him to a baseball camp in Los Angeles in February 2001. There, Nash worked out with MLB players, including Tony Gwynn, Barry Bonds, Eddie Murray, and Alvin Davis. Harold Reynolds also discussed Nash on television. Officials from other organizations felt that the story reminded them of the hoax of Sidd Finch. Despite legal troubles, including an arrest for felony robbery, Nash reported to spring training with the Devil Rays in 2001. They assigned him to extended spring training, and then to the Princeton Devil Rays of the Rookie-level Appalachian League in 2001, playing alongside future major leaguer Jonny Gomes. In his first season, Nash hit .240 with eight home runs and 29 runs batted in in 47 games played, and was considered a long-term project for the organization due to his lack of formal training. According to Latino, Nash \\"couldn't read, couldn't write...Just wasn't ready to function in society...with an education and social skills of a kid about thirteen years old.\\" Returning to Louisiana after the 2001 season, Nash spent nearly nine months in jail in 2002 for aggravated and statutory rape, after allegedly having sex with a 15-year-old girl. After the aggravated rape charges were dropped, Nash agreed to a plea bargain and was given a 10-year suspended sentence. The Devil Rays released Nash in September 2002, the day after he was released from jail. After being released by the Rays, the Cincinnati Reds signed Nash in the 2002‚Äì03 offseason. The club voided his contract for unspecified legal reasons, believed to be a bar fight for which Nash was arrested. Nash was arrested again in 2005 for a parole violation, and was charged for drug possession, leading him to serve the full 10 years of his previously suspended jail sentence. Nash was released from prison in November 2013. He was arrested again, however, in 2015 on drug charges.http://www.nola.com/crime/baton- rouge/index.ssf/2015/02/former_baseball_player_gregory.html Personal Nash's cousin, former NBA player John \\"Hot Rod\\" Williams, organized the Williams All Stars, the Sugar Cane League team on which Nash played. \\"The Story of Toe Nash\\" was featured on ESPN's SportsCenter on June 27, 2014.

It concerns physically shared amenities with physically divided ownership as to the land or surface on which they rest. Facts Constructed in 1907, numbers 56 and 58 in a semi-detached housing estate were built with a path between them, giving access from a road to the back gardens. The boundary between the two was the mid line of the path. On 14 May 1976 the estate owners sold number 56 to the tenants under the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 section 8 i.e. the lessees (tenants) exercised their rights to leasehold enfranchisement (purchase the freehold underlying their house). The tenants had not required an express right of way be included under LRA 1967, section 10(3)(a). In October 1976 number 58 was also enfranchised. In 2003, the occupants of number 56 sued number 58 for a right of way. The learned judge at first instance rejected the claim that any right appertained to number 56 under the Law of Property Act 1925, section 62(2) because there was no evidence the path was used for gaining access to the back garden at the time of the conveyance. But he accepted an easement over the path should be implied into the 14 May 1976 conveyance under Wheeldon v Burrows because it was necessary for reasonable enjoyment. Judgment Chadwick LJ held that there was no difficulty in implying into each lease the grant and reservation of reciprocal rights to share the pathway. The alternative type of implied easements, under Wheeldon v Burrows, did not apply where between the land conveyed and that retained, there was common ownership, but not common occupation. There needed to be both. Hence it is inapplicable to standard leasehold enfranchisement.

She is the leader of the Green Party, who was a member of the Knesset for the Democratic Union alliance. She came to national prominence as one of the leaders of the 2011 Israeli social justice protests, focusing on housing, public services, income inequality and democracy, and later became spokeswoman of the movement. She was subsequently elected to the Knesset in 2013 as a member of the Labor Party in 2013. The party contested the 2015 elections as part of the Zionist Union alliance, with Shaffir retaining her seat. She was re-elected again in the April 2019 elections, in which Labor ran alone. However, after losing a Labor leadership election to Amir Peretz in June 2019, she left the party and resigned from the Knesset and became head of the Green Movement. Her new party formed the Democratic Union alongside Meretz and the Israel Democratic Party. Shaffir lost her Knesset seat in the 2020 election.  Biography  Shaffir was born in Netanya, Israel, to a family of both Ashkenazi Jewish (Polish- Jewish, Lithuanian-Jewish, and Romanian-Jewish) and Sephardic Jewish (Iraqi- Jewish) descent. At the age of 12, Shaffir's family moved to Pardesiya, a small town in the Sharon area, where her parents had an accounting firm. Shaffir joined HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed (Federation of Working and Studying Youth). After high school, Shaffir worked for a year in Tiberias as a part of a volunteer group affiliated with the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel. She served in the Israel Defense Forces as a cadet in the flight academy of the Israeli Air Force. After five months, she began to write for the IDF magazine, Bamahane. In this position she covered the Israeli disengagement from Gaza and the 2006 Lebanon war. After completing her military service, Shaffir was accepted into the Olive Tree Scholarship Program6 Feb 2009: Column 908, The Olive Tree Trust, Publications.parliament.uk by the City University of London, an initiative to support future leaders who desire to change the status quo of the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. During her studies in London, Shaffir worked as an intern in the British Parliament as part of the Undergraduate ParliaMentors program and was awarded runner up in the JRS Competition for Student Journalists in 2008 for her piece covering Iraqi refugees in England. Shaffir received a B.A in Sociology and Journalism in 2009. Shaffir, who plays the piano, drums, guitar, violin and oud, continued her studies in Israel at the Rimon School of Jazz and Contemporary Music in Ramat-HaSharon for a year. She then enrolled in the M.A program at the Cohn Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Ideas at Tel Aviv University. Shaffir worked as a freelance journalist and an editor for National Geographic, the Ha'ir weekly newspaper, the Mako Magazine and Yedioth Ahronoth internet site Xnet, where she published the first article to appear in the Israeli media about the 2011 Israeli social justice protests.  Social activism  Shaffir, alongside with Daphni Leef and Itzik Shmuli, was a founder, organizer and unofficial leader of the 2011 Israeli social justice protests, when about 400,000 Israelis went to the streets in a series of public demonstrations. On 17 July 2011, Shaffir debated with Likud MK Miri Regev on the current events television program \\"Erev Hadash\\" about the protest against the housing prices. In the following months, she helped found over 120 tent camps throughout Israel, led demonstrations, including the March of the Million,http://www.jpost.com/National-News/March-of-the-Million- Over-460000-protest-across-country and lobbied with members of the Knesset to pursue a social justice agenda. She served as spokesperson for the Israeli media and represented the protest movement in foreign media outlets. In 2012, Shaffir was a keynote speaker at three U.S.-based conferences: J-Street, together with Israeli writer Amos Oz, the Jewish Federations of North America's TribeFest and the Personal Democracy Forum. In February 2012, Shaffir and fellow tent protesters Alon Lee-Green and Yonatan Levi founded the Israeli Social Movement. In August 2012, Shaffir and her colleagues embarked on a tour from the southern sea port of Eilat to Kiryat Shmona on the Lebanese border, to listen to activists and citizens regarding their concerns. Their last status was published in Facebook on 9 September 2012, and a month later Shaffir announced her intent to run for the Knesset as a member of the Labor Party.  Political career  Shaffir with Austrian Prime Minister Sebastian Kurz in Jerusalem, 2016 Shaffir was approached by the Labor Party in May 2012 to join its ranks in preparation for the 2013 general elections held on 22 January 2013. She officially declared her candidacy for the Labor Party list on 12 October 2012. Shaffir placed 9th (moving up to 8th after Amir Peretz's resignation) as a result of the 29 November 2012 primaries, securing her a seat in the Knesset following the 22 January 2013 general elections. After the 13 January 2015 primaries, Shaffir placed second, and so holds the third place on the internal party list (after party leader Isaac Herzog and Shelly Yachimovich). In the combined Labor-Hatnuah party, Shaffir holds the fourth place due to Hatnuah Leader Tzipi Livni's placement behind Herzog. Initially elected at age 27, Shaffir became the youngest female Knesset member in its history.https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/03/stav-shaffir- ayelet-shaked-social-justice-habayit-hayehudi.html/ She was also the MK with the lowest net worth, a total of $20,000, owning neither an apartment nor a car. Zvi Zrahiya, Knesset's youngest lawmaker has net worth of around $20,000, Haaretz, 04.04.13 She was one of eight MKs to forgo their 2015 pay raise calling it \\"distasteful\\" in light of wage stagnation in the Israeli job market. On 2 July 2019, Shaffir ran for the head of the Labor Party, and got 27% of the votes after Peretz, who received 47% of the votes. Shmuli reached third after Shaffir, and got 26% of the votes. = Financial transparency = Shaffir's key accomplishment during her first term was instituting greater financial transparency in the Israeli State budget as a member of the Knesset Finance Committee. In May 2012, Shaffir joined 10,000 protestors demanding that the proposed 2013 Israeli State Budget be made more favorable to middle and lower income Israelis. Shaffir appointed a team of volunteers to investigate the budgetary transfers and eventually brought her concerns to the Supreme Court, which ruled that the Finance Ministry must reach a compromise with Shaffir on a new method for budget transfers by February 2015. Shaffir was an advocate of fair compensation for residents of southern Israel who were most impacted by the 2014 Operation Protective Shield in Gaza. She objected to a political deal to transfer millions of shekels to settlements and nothing to the South. Shaffir got funds allocated to local authorities impacted by rocket fire in the South, but 73 days after Operation Protective Shield began, the funds had yet to be transferred. In response, Shaffir called for a meeting to address the lack of action. Shaffir objected to the transfer of millions of shekels to the World Zionist Organization Settlement Division, which circumvents oversight because legally it is under no obligation to report what it does with government funding. She wrote a letter complaining that Finance Committee Chair Slomiansky should not be allowed to conduct meetings on the World Zionist Organization Settlement Division‚Äôs budget. Shaffir also argued against funding for the Jewish Identity Administration which she considered a ploy to promote a right wing political agenda. Following the dismissal of Finance Minister Yair Lapid by Prime Minister Netanyahu on 2 December 2014, the Finance Committee transferred millions of shekels to the settlements, despite objections by Shaffir. She was repeatedly forcibly removed from Committee meetings for complaining about the lack of clear information about what was being voted on. On 19 February 2015, the World Zionist Organization (WZO) announced that it would end the Prime Minister Office's oversight over the Settlement Division. Shaffir had publicly criticized their secret dealings that included extensive indirect funding for building West Bank settlements. \\"Coupled with reports of possibly illegal abuse of funds, the division has faced calls for reform from both the left and center, especially ahead of the March 17 election.\\" The WZO also said it would increase transparency and make its records public, with the appointment of a special comptroller to look into the division's workings. = Special Committee for the Transparency and Accessibility of Government Information = In July 2015 it was decided that Shaffir would start and chair a new semi permanent committee in parliament, The Special Committee for the Transparency and Accessibility of Government Information (also known as the 'Transparency committee').http://knesset.gov.il/committees/eng/committee_eng.asp?c_id=571 The committee deals with transparency and accountability, open government, open data and e-gov in all branches of government in Israel. = Women rights and freedom of religious practice = Shaffir donned a tallit and joined Women of the Wall in prayer at the Western Wall in Jerusalem in March 2013. Shaffir and her fellow parliamentarians were initially barred from attending ‚Äì according to the police, women wearing tallit were a \\"disturbance of public order\\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/female-israeli-mks-join-women-of- the-wall-no-arrests-for-first-time-in-months.premium-1.508895 ‚Äì but their legal status as legislators forced the police to let them pray. She joined the women in solidarity with their equal right to pray, but also for the broader struggle for freedom of religion in Israel ‚Äì \\"our freedom to live how we want to live, with our own beliefs and our own personal way of practicing Judaism or other religions.\\" In spring 2014, Shaffir traveled to the US as a member of a delegation of female Knesset members studying the role of women in legislatures. When it was reported during the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict that shelters in the city of Ashdod were excluding women from so-called \\"men only\\" shelters, Shaffir filed an urgent complaint with the Religious Affairs Ministry, demanding to put an immediate halt to the segregation. It was promptly ended. = LGBT rights = Shaffir proposed legislation in May 2013 that would allow same-sex couples to get government recognition for civil unions. Despite wide support within the Labor Party and from individual Knesset members from Likud and Hatnua, Yesh Atid blocked the bill in favor of their own civil unions bill. After a Haaretz poll showed support from 70% of Israelis for full and equal rights for the gay community, Shaffir with the help of attorneys and community activists, compiled a list of 12 ways to benefit the LGBTQ community through ministerial regulatory action, sidestepping the need for legislation. These include rules making it easier for same-sex couples to adopt and to enter into surrogacy arrangements. = Socioeconomic justice and peace = Shaffir spoke about connecting socioeconomic issues with the Israeli-Palestinian peace process at the Fall 2013 J Street Conference in Washington, DC. She also spoke to the need for cautious exploration of non-violent means for Israel to resolve its conflict with Iran. In her keynote speech at the 2015 J Street Conference, Shaffir spoke of her vision of an Israel that celebrates diversity and treats the poor with compassion but above all \\"an Israel that does not control millions of Palestinians.\\" Shaffir with MKs Yehiel Bar and Orly Levi launched a lobby for the advancement of fair rent after a report prepared by the Knesset Research and Information Center found that rents across Israel had increased by 49% since 2007. On 13 February 2014, Shaffir proposed legislation to regulate the rental housing market. The Housing Cabinet adopted her proposed fair rental law. = Asylum policy = Shaffir advocated for Israel to adopt a formal asylum policy that distinguishes between refugees and migrants with quotas based on Israel‚Äôs capacity for absorption. She supported the Supreme Court‚Äôs quashing of the 2012 Law for the Prevention of Infiltration (Amendment no. 3) (temporary order), which mandated an almost automatic three-year detention of ‚Äòinfiltrators.‚Äô She said, \\"We are a country based on refugees. My grandmother escaped from Iraq and my grandfather escaped during the Holocaust. It is a country that knows what it means to escape with your life.\\" = OECD Committee on Government Transparency = On 11 February 2017, Shaffir was appointed Chair of the newly established Committee of Government transparency in the OECD organization. The Committee is a joint initiative led by Shaffir, the Israeli Foreign Affairs ministry and the OECD representative in Israel. The first meeting took place in Paris, on 12 February 2017 and had representatives from more than 90 countries. = Democratic Union = In July 2019, Shaffir left the Labor party to run as part of the Democratic Union party, a union of the Green Movement(which Shaffir now leads), Meretz and Israel Democratic Party. She resigned from the Knesset and was replaced by the next person on the Labor list, Merav Michaeli. In December 2019, Shaffir announced that she would be renaming the Green Movement the Green Party, and would run independently in the 2020 elections.  Awards  * On 28 November 2018, Apolitical, a global policy platform in London, included Shaffir in its list of the Hundred Future Leaders: The World‚Äôs Most Influential Young People in Government for 2018, which included among the rest Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Michael Tubbs, Naisula Lesuuda and Sayida Ounissi. Avi Gabbay, the chairman of the Israeli Labor Party, praised Shaffir for her achievement.

In this case there was no remedy for the flooding found to be natural and not recently exacerbated by the defendant. The court attached to the properties an old, 1921, easement of drainage passing both land holdings, in this case two common examples of lowland water engineering, dykes controlled against tides by one-way valves, mentioned in the properties' deeds and, duplicatively, established the right by prescription. The dykes lay in the claimant's own land who had failed to maintain them and failed to account for the flows caused by reduction of water extraction from the lake upstream. The claimant had failed to repair the pump and clear ditches on his own land which had been agreed between the previous owners to give channelled drainage from a lake above. It was for the claimant to recognise the danger posed by its waterline being raised in 1954 by the building up of a weir. Facts Somerleyton's large holdings on the right (and further to the east) as in the 19th century drained via the old pumping windmill site and sluice into the tidal Waveney, passing Green's land at centre and at north A restaurant is today at Priory farm house, St Olaves, Fritton near Great Yarmouth, Mr Green's Farm Green had substantial lower land straddling two, parallel, long- established dykes in St Olaves in the Norfolk Broads. Green admitted he was responsible for keeping the dykes in working order. Water from Lord Someleyton‚Äôs higher land drained into the dykes, and Green brought an action in nuisance to stop flooding happening after a deep winter flood. He attributed the topping of the dykes to the damming with a weir in 1954 of a Middle Ages-enlarged lake (Fritton Decoy) and other features of Somerleyton‚Äôs upper land. Water topped the dykes into Priory Marsh which Green used as summer pasture for his cattle at Priory Farm. Under a 1958 drainage deed, if Green chose to accept his predecessor's burdens under it as to the dyke, then Somerleyton was responsible to renew but not to repair or maintain a 4.5 to 5 ton electric water pump at the bottom of Green's land, but nothing further; its exclusion proviso was extensive such as a breach in the sea wall (below) or exceptional rainfall. The old main drainage channel was long silted up at the tidal sluice which occurred .... within the length which the claimant's predecessors had undertaken to maintain.http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2003/198.html Green's re- amended particulars of claim before the hearings plead that Fritton Lake is not \\"present naturally\\" on the Upper Land...a \\"reservoir\\" which Lord Somerleyton has at all material times \\"maintained\\"; that it is of such a size that it is reasonably foreseeable that water escaping from it is likely to damage Priory Marshes; and that Lord Somerleyton is accordingly liable for the damage to Priory Marshes caused by the flooding, under the rule in Rylands v Fletcher (1868). The judge rejected that claim, and the Court of Appeal refused grounds to appeal against that part of the decision. The trustees of Lord Somerleyton‚Äôs land counterclaimed that they had an easement for the water drainage from a 1921 conveyance by implied reservation, showing it attempted to incorporate a deed of covenant and to bind the property. Green countered (by amended reply and defence to counterclaim) that any such easement would be of a limited nature, and not such as to vest in the upper land owners a general right to discharge water (including, in particular, water emanating from the lake) into the dykes on Priory Marshes. The judge held there was no remedy in nuisance for naturally flowing water, applying Leakey v National Trust [1980]. Judgment Jonathan Parker 's judgment approved by the rest of the panel, held that nuisance could cover floodwater relating to a shared conduit. But Green had not made clear what action they ought to take, nor had he taken action to reduce risk himself. As the downstream owner he had abrogated his responsibilities. Somerleyton's counterclaim was upheld. The provisions in the drainage deed were incorporated by reference into the conveyance to Green - the test in the final court of appeal's decision in Pwllbach Colliery Co Ltd v Woodman was expressly applied (similar to section 54 of the Law of Property Act 1925), and by implication those drainage rights were intended to be proprietary. So Somerleyton did have an easement of drainage. The Court of Appeal held also the defendant's land enjoyed a duplicative easement by prescription, applying the test for that set in Honey v Silversprings [1992] EWHC that the use(r) relied on had the requisite certainty and uniformity to establish a prescriptive right.

It uses a patient's own immune system to target tumor cells in prostate cancer, glioblastomas, and potentially pancreatic cancer. ALECSAT research, directed by Alexei Kirken and Karine Dzhandzhugazyan, has led to several clinical trials.  Method  Blood samples containing the required precursors for CD4+ helper T-cell, CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell, and natural killer (NK) cell are extracted from the patient and activated before being re- administered to the patient to induce anti-tumor activity. These cells are activated in a process called ‚Äúin vitro immunization‚Äù, which allows for selection and expansion of T-cells of varying specificity and has been validated in patients with advanced melanoma skin cancer. In order to have efficient eradication of cancer cells, the immune system cells should be able to both populate in the secondary lymphoid organs for a long-lasting effect and target a shared variety of tumor cells as opposed to one, specific cancer cell. In the ALECSAT method, several different cells are activated to accomplish this. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are activated to target the cells that present proteins characteristic of tumor cells. Some tumor cells, however, do not present an antigen due to lack of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and therefore cannot be recognized by the CTLs. The cells that do not present an antigen are targeted by activated NK cells, leaving little opportunity for any cancer cells to escape. CTLs and NK cells are both effector cells so helper T-cells (Th) are also prepared in order to create memory cells for long term resistance toward tumor cells. T helper 1 (TH1) cells, when injected with overexpressed tumor antigens, have been shown to enhance migration of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) into the draining lymph node in mice, further enhancing immune response through activation of CTLs. Tumor antigens are typically cancer/testis antigens. Chemically inducing this antigen in T-cells by DNA demethylation allows the immune system to recognize a wide range of tumors. This method of activation may be used for the preparation of anti-tumor vaccines or for ex vivo activation of the cytotoxic T-cells which can then be followed by the expansion of T-cells through normal, mature dendritic cells. The latter method is utilized for ALECSAT to treat cancer by adoptive T-cell immunotherapy.  Process  Refer to the adjacent diagram for a depiction the ALECSAT protocol of immunization that occurs over a period of 26 days: The first step is the isolation of the blood into lymphocytes and monocytes. The lymphocytes are frozen and the monocytes are differentiated into dendritic cells. After 6 days, the lymphocytes are mixed with dendritic cells and incubated for eight days. This process creates CD4+ enriched lymphocytes. After this, the lymphocytes are treated for three days in order to induce the expression of CGL antigen. Next, another set of frozen lymphocytes are mixed with the CD4+ expressing CGL antigens and incubated for 11 days. After that, dendritic cells are added to the lymphocytes to induce further lymphocyte proliferation. Lastly, after seven days of culture, the cells are prepared for injection. This whole process takes a total of 26 days. ALECSAT Protocol  Research  Research on adoptive transfer in melanoma patients laid the groundwork for companies focusing on adoptive transfer research in other types of cancer. Research carried out at the Department of Tumour Cell Biology in Copenhagen has shown that CTL clones targeting specific melanoma tumor associated antigens (gp100 and MART-1) can successfully proliferate if melanoma cell lines are carefully preselected. At the same department, the SCID mouse model was demonstrated as ‚Äúan excellent model system‚Äù for studying interaction between tumors and CTLs. Using this model, eradication of a human melanoma tumor by in vitro generating CTL clone was accomplished. In a study run at the University de la Sante, the adoptive transfer of cloned T cells in ‚Äúin vitro immunization‚Äù caused increased frequencies of cancer fighting T cells in 18 out of 35 melanoma patients.

Facts Ms Gillman had taken a seven-year lease of a school built in the back yard of a three-storey building that had a forecourt by the street. It was leased by a third party. The school's lease (and underlying freehold) had a right of way by the building in front of it, but no express right of way over the forecourt in front of that. The building was leased to accountants for 21 years from 1977, and the freehold was bought by Mr Hair in 1985. Gillman claimed that she had been given permission to park her car in the forecourt, and this crystallised into an easement under Law of Property Act 1925, section 62(1) when acting for the school she entered into the lease. Hair before the action denied Gillman the parking space he had earlier allowed on unstated terms. He sought a declaration Gillman would have no such continuing right related to her school. Judgment Judge LJ sitting alone in the High Court held the permission was capable of being an easement, but Law of Property Act 1925, section 62(1) did not apply because here the use was \\"never intended to be on a permanent basis\\". Gillman appealed. Held: that the right, even though precarious, was capable of falling under Law of Property Act 1925, section 62(1): Wright v Macadam [1949] 2 KB 744.

Facts Mrs Edna Crow of Stone House Farm sued Mr Robin Wood of Wether Cote Farm (both in Hawnby) for his sheep straying into her land, alleging cattle/chattel trespass. She lived on a Yorkshire moor, once long in common ownership where sheep had the right to stray, but then parcels were sold off, several maintaining their straying animals such as Wood. From 1966 Crow ceased to keep up a fence. Wood claimed that under an implied grant at common law and Law of Property Act 1925, section 62, she was under a duty to keep up her fences separating her private element of her land from the commons element (for the benefit of those with grazing rights on it).http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1970/5.html Judge awarded ¬£205 damages and an injunction, and Mr Wood appealed.

It concerned a restraint of trade covenant and was unlike the others surrounding it (see purposive interpretation and contextual interpretation) not expressed to bind all heirs and assigns (or other synonyms for successors in title). Facts Morrells of Oxford Ltd trading as Morrells Brewery, were the successors in title to the original purchaser of a pub (i.e. they are the current owners). They sought to enforce a covenant against the developers of adjoining land, who were the successors in title to the local authority and whose registered land referred also to the same deed. In selling this adjoining farmland four decades before, the council had agreed not to allow the (alcohol-) licensing of premises within half a mile of the pub which they licensed and allowed to be built on that basis in the 1960s. The covenant was clear enough to qualify for enforcement if the local authority proposed to breach the covenant by selling alcohol on its own land but they did not and were in the process of selling the land to independent developers who ultimately built the Kassam Stadium of Oxford United FC. The stadium's developer calculated it was a commercial necessity for an on-site alcohol consumption licence to be legally permissible on the site before completing their purchase of the stadium. The relevant, contentious Deed of Conveyance dated to 1962. Morrells argued that it bound and benefitted both sets of successors (respectively) by meeting the requirements of the Law of Property Act 1925, section 79.[2001] 2 WLR 128 Judgment Robert Walker LJ held the purpose of s 79 was to remove the difficulty of expressing an intention to bind successors by allowing in some cases that intention to be presumed unless a contrary intention was apparent. Here the other covenants in the conveyance made it clear they should bind successors. The court held that the absence of such words in the covenant amounted to the contrary intention, that is an intention not to bind successors. The covenant was thus personal in nature (inter partes) and could not be enforced against successors in title. He said that Law of Property Act 1925, section 79 ‚Äòextends the number of persons whose acts or omissions are within the reach of the covenant in the sense of making equitable remedies available, provided that the other conditions for equity‚Äôs intervention are satisfied.‚Äô The section on its own (per se) does not make all covenants bind all successors, it leaves latitude as to construction (wording) as whether certain covenants are to be considered personal, those which are imposed so as not to bind the land itself. He summarised the applicable test for whether a covenant touches and concerns the land: \\"A‚Äôs duty is a duty not to make a particular use of A‚Äôs land; and A‚Äôs duty enhances B‚Äôs Freehold or Lease (i.e. benefits B‚Äôs land); and A‚Äôs duty, when created, is not intended to impose only a personal duty on A.\\" Cases cited =Applied= *Inland Revenue Comrs v Bernstein [1961] Ch 399; [1961] 2 WLR 143; [1961] 1 All ER 341, CA Obiter dictum of Lord Evershed MR ; [1961] Ch 399, 413Index Card: Morrells of Oxford v Oxford United FC Ltd ICLR, London =Considered= *Sefton v Tophams Ltd [1967] 1 AC 50; [1966] 2 WLR 814; [1966] 1 All ER 1039, HL(E) *In re Royal Victoria Pavilion, Ramsgate [1961] Ch 581; [1961] 3 WLR 491; [1961] 3 All ER 83, Ch D *Powell v Hemsley [1909] 2 Ch 252, CA See also *English land law *English trusts law *English property law References Category:English land case law Category:Court of Appeal (England and Wales) cases Category:2001 in British law Category:2001 in case law ","title":"Morrells of Oxford Ltd v Oxford United Football Club"},{"id":"35739632","text":"Slow cinema is a genre of art cinema film-making that emphasizes long takes, and is typically characterised by a style that is minimalist, observational, and with little or no narrative.Steven Rose.

Reception Sight & Sound noted of the definition of slow cinema that \\"The length of a shot, on which much of the debate revolves, is a quite abstract measure if divorced from what takes place within it\\". The Guardian contrasted the long takes of the genre with the two-second average shot length in Hollywood action movies, and noted that \\"they opt for ambient noises or field recordings rather than bombastic sound design, embrace subdued visual schemes that require the viewer's eye to do more work, and evoke a sense of mystery that springs from the landscapes and local customs they depict more than it does from generic convention.\\" The genre has been described as an \\"act of organized resistance\\" similar to the Slow food movement. =Criticism= It has been criticized as being indifferent or even hostile to audiences.

Circumstances of case (1907) On 7 October 1907 in Christchurch, New Zealand, kitchen maid Hobbs gave birth to an infant in the lavatory of the restaurant where she worked. A coworker had noticed her pregnancy for the last three months, but Miss Hobbs appeared shortly after giving birth and stated that she was recovering from cholera. However, there were bloodstains found in the lavatory and the body of a newborn infant was found, wrapped in Miss Hobbs' skirt and clothing underneath a pile of clothes. When questioned by police, Miss Hobbs stated that she was not aware whether the newborn infant was dead or alive, as it had not cried since its birth. Miss Hobbs was tried before the Supreme Court for child murder but the defence argued that the young woman was experiencing anguish, psychological disorientation and intense pain during unassisted childbirth. Furthermore, the infant's father was nowhere to be found. Under such circumstances, the court decided to show leniency toward Hobbs and she was acquitted. She married Samuel Blackburn in 1912 (they later divorced) and died on September 30, 1952, having apparently had no more children.\\"A Charge of Concealment: New Zealand Truth: 23 November 1907Stephen Eldred-Grigg: An 'Ordinary Infanticide': Christchurch Press: 6 May 2006 See also *Winifred Carrick, another New Zealand woman acquitted of killing her child, in 1917. *Infanticide in Nineteenth Century New Zealand References Further reading *Bronwyn Dalley: \\"Criminal Conversations: Gender and Narratives of Child Murder in Nineteenth Century New Zealand\\" in Caroline Dalley and Julie Montgomerie (eds) The Gendered Kiwi: Auckland: Auckland University Press: 1999.

It was also shown at the 2012 San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival, the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival and the 2012 New York Film Festival. The film was selected as the Portuguese entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 86th Academy Awards, but it was not nominated. Plot In the autumn of 1810, the French forces of Marshal Mass√©na are invading Portugal and are temporarily halted by the Anglo- Portuguese army under Viscount Wellington at the Battle of Bussaco. As a bitter winter approaches, Wellington withdraws his troops towards the fortifications he has prepared in secret at the Lines of Torres Vedras. Using a scorched earth defence, he forces the inhabitants to evacuate the land in front of the Lines and destroys all supplies which could be useful to the French. The film illustrates these dramatic events by a series of vignettes which show the effects on combatants, both regular soldiers and guerrillas, and on the civilian population.

The Maya civilization was spread out throughout much of Central America. One of the common links of the Mayan culture of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and Belize is the game played with a rubber ball, about which we have learned from several sources. Maya ballgame was played with big stone courts. The ball court itself was a focal point of Maya cities and symbolized the city's wealth and power. History Ballcourt at Uaxactun, in the Pet√©n Basin region of the Maya lowlands The Maya ball game originated more than 3,000 years ago. The Popol Vuh describes the history of the K'iche' people and their rulers and mentions the important position of the Maya ballgame. Through this ball game, a conflict of the forces of darkness and light is described and enacted. By tradition, the twin brothers Hun Hunaphu and Xbalanque used their time on earth to play ball. Through the noise of the game, the anger of Vucub Came, the master of the underworld, was aroused. A fight ensued, which resulted in the formation of the game. After the game, one of the brothers was decapitated and his head was used as the game ball. From the decapitated trunk of the player, blood escaped in the form of snakes. This blood was taken as a symbol of fertility. This scene is depicted in reliefs on the walls of game courts, such as the most famous example in Chichen Itza in Mexico. Public structure 10px-shaped ball court in Cihuatan site, El Salvador In the highlands of Chiapas and of Guatemala alone, 300 courts have been found. Of these, 85% have been dated in the post-classic period. Only two early classic courts have been reported: Palenque and Copan.Scarborough The playing arena was in the shape of an 10px. High platforms on either side of the court allowed for large numbers of spectators. Arenas were decorated with portable stone court markers known as hacha, usually depicting animals or skulls. The ball court was surrounded by painted murals that depicted Mayan mythology, warriors, captives, rulers, and ceremonies. The ballcourt in Cerros is contemporary and date to the Tulix ceramic phase (100BC-100AD). Both are similar in date to the other major public structures. Both courts at Cerros are oriented N-S and orient to the N-S medial axis of a pyramid. They are also oriented with the W axis of another pyramid, and its associated plaza, appears to intersect the medial axis of the site of the site at a point approximately equidistant from either court.  Religious aspects The Maya ballgame was more than just an athletic event: it was also a religious event of regeneration that was integral to their continued existence. The Maya showed devotion to their gods by playing the game and by sacrifices. Scholars debate about who was subject to ritual killing at ball games and how frequently. Opinions range from \\"The ballgame provided an opportunity to show devoutness to the gods by sacrificing captured kings and high lords, or the losing opponents of the game\\" to \\"the players were most likely not sacrificed.... sometimes a captive might be executed at the game, but [these sacrifices] weren't an integral part of the game. That person would have been expedited [executed] anyway.\\" Thirteen Rabbit's ritual sacrifice shows death by decapitation and disembowelment.Vilcox Looking at sculptural portrayals this was most likely the standard technique used at El Tajin. As trophy heads were popular in Mayan Culture, it follows that they were important in ballgame. Some death heads occurred as figurines; so sacred were the small sculptures that they were preserved and appear as offerings at non-elite burials in Late Classic domestic interments. As stated earlier, decapitation was used as sacrifice at El Tajin. By looking at sculptures at other ballcourts decapitation was also used at Aparicio, Veracruz, and Chichen Itza, Yucatan. Severing of the head is also seen in the Popol Vuh. Some sources say the winning team's captain was decapitated, and at Chichen √¨tza you can barely see that a squash and a couple of snakes representing Kuklkan popped out of the sacrificed captain's head. This was an honor and the captain would have to accept a drink or food item. Game-play Ballcourt goal, Chich√©n Itz√° The rules seem to have changed over the centuries. Certainly two teams played against each other. The number of players varied between 2 and 6 players per team. Sometimes, an additional person is seen in the illustrations, who is believed to be a referee. The game was played for 2 weeks. A rubber ball was always used. Its size and weight varied over the centuries. Most historians assume a weight of and a size of a skittle ball. The existence of a caoutchouc tree was necessary to produce the ball. These trees were found in the tropical regions in the Maya territories. The ball was put in motion by action of the right hip, the right elbow and the right knee and was not permitted to touch the ground. It could be passed from person to person in each team by propulsion by one of the above body parts. The aim was to move the ball back to the opposite team, preferably through the ring. The goal of the opposition (what today might be termed ‚Äòthe defense‚Äô) was to force the offense to lose control and to allow the ball to touch the ground. The stone ring was an innovation of the late-classic and early post-classic periods, as seen in Chi. The usual dress for players is known from iconographic and figural findings. These show leather protection mainly at the hips and the chest, but sometimes also at the knees and the arms, though very seldom at the feet. The clothing was used to protect against the impact of the ball. The protected parts of the body were used to strike the ball. Some players would wear head dresses (like deer heads) for ritual reasons. =Physical aspects of the ballgame= Despite variations in game-play over the centuries, it would appear that the physical loads were most similar to those of soccer or tennis. Most likely the players of ballgame manifested a heart rate and blood pressure responses consistent with physical loads of light/moderate intensity, in the range of 4.5‚Äì5.5 METs. Thus, the cardiovascular demands of popular sports seem to have remained relatively similar through several millennia.

She was born (1892) and married (1919) as Mary Winifred Carrick. Circumstances of case (December 1917) In May 1915, Carrick tried to abandon her infant son Donald Lewis Carrick by leaving him in a hollow tree on the banks of the Avon River in Christchurch, New Zealand. She was located and bail was set at two hundred pounds. She was unable to pay and served a two-year prison sentence. In the interim period, her son had been fostered out to the Burns family in Addington, a suburb of Christchurch.\\"Alleged Abandonment of Child\\" Hawera and Normanby Star: 31 May 1915 Upon her release, Carrick contacted the Burns and spent time with her three-year-old son, although she had stated that she was experiencing financial hardship and could not pay maintenance for her child. On the night of December 10, 1917, Donald went missing. On December 11, he was found amidst potatoes in the Burns family garden at 31 Clifton Street with his head battered in.

As it happened, the jury indeed had doubts about the evidence offered and returned a not guilty verdict, and so Carrick was acquitted of 'wilful murder' of her child.\\"Not guilty\\" Wanganui Chronicle: 20 February 1918Stephen Eldred-Grigg: \\"An 'Ordinary' Infanticide\\" Christchurch Press: 6 May 2006 Carrick married Charles Riley on 2 May 1919 and appears to have died in 1938.

The drug-violence in Nuevo Laredo began back in 2003, when the city was controlled by the Gulf Cartel. Most media reports that write about the Mexican Drug War, however, point to 2006 as the start of the drug war. That year is a convenient historical marker because that's when Felipe Calder√≥n took office and carried out an aggressive approach against the cartels. But authors like Ioan Grillo and Sylvia Longmire note that Mexico's drug war actually began at the end of Vicente Fox's administration in 2004, when the first major battle took place in Nuevo Laredo between the Sinaloa Cartel and Los Zetas, who at that time worked as the armed wing of the Gulf Cartel. When Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, the former leader of the Gulf Cartel, was arrested in 2003, the Sinaloa Cartel, sensing weakness, tried to move in on Nuevo Laredo, unleashing a bloody battle. Los Zetas, however, were successful in expelling the Sinaloa organization out of Nuevo Laredo, and have ruled the city \\"with fear\\" ever since. Nevertheless, the Gulf cartel and Los Zetas broke relations in early 2010, worsening the violence across northeast Mexico. The cartels are fighting for control of the corridor in Nuevo Laredo that leads into Interstate 35, one of the most lucrative routes for drug traffickers. Nuevo Laredo is a lucrative drug corridor because of the large volume of trucks that pass through the area, and the multiple (exploitable) ports of entry. Over 40% of all cargo crossings from Mexico to the United States crosses through the border checkpoints in Nuevo Laredo. It is for the same reason that Tijuana and Ciudad Ju√°rez are so valuable for the drug trafficking organizations. Past incidents in Nuevo Laredo =2003 shootout= At around 3 am on 1 August 2003, the Federal Investigations Agency (AFI) confronted a group of armed men in the streets of Nuevo Laredo. Members of the AFI were staying at a hotel when Juan Manuel Mu√±oz Morales, the attorney general of the city, called for help. He was reportedly being chased by several individuals in a dark-colored truck. Consequently, the AFI officers followed the truck with seven of their vehicles, triggering a shootout between the police officers and alleged drug traffickers. The armed confrontation lasted for more than 40 minutes, provoking \\"panic\\" and turning Nuevo Laredo into a \\"battlefield.\\" The gun detonations were heard throughout most of the city. Some witnesses, who preferred to remain anonymous, claimed that they saw over \\"18 armed men in black with ski-masks.\\" During the chase, five armed men in another vehicle shot at the police convoy. The triggermen in the two vehicles then engaged in a gunfight with the AFI for minutes, but one of the vehicles collided with a police truck. The vehicle the drug traffickers were in then caught on fire, and two of the gunmen were burned to death. The third one died on the sidewalk. According to PGR, the three gunmen that were killed were members of Los Negros, a group of hitmen under the tutelage of Joaqu√≠n Guzm√°n Loera (a.k.a. El Chapo) and of the Ju√°rez Cartel. Rocket-launchers, along with an \\"inexact number of assault rifles,\\" were reportedly used in the attack. In addition, the government agency stated that 198 municipal police officers were to be investigated for possible connections with the Gulf Cartel; Manuel Mu√±oz, the attorney general who was being chased, was detained by the Mexican authorities. It is believed that he had liberated five members of Los Zetas who had been detained during the armed confrontation. According to Esmas.com, this shooting was the first major gunfire in Nuevo Laredo between the Mexican authorities and cartel members in over thirty years. Between 1 January and 1 August 2003, 45 homicides were reported in Nuevo Laredo, along with 40 kidnappings. =El Chapo enters Nuevo Laredo= Mug shot of Joaqu√≠n Guzm√°n Loera, El Chapo. After the apprehension of Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n in 2003, the former leader of the Gulf Cartel, his criminal organization went through a leadership crisis, since there was no visible leader to take the lead of the cartel. Nonetheless, Joaqu√≠n Guzm√°n Loera, the drug boss of the Sinaloa cartel who is best known as El Chapo, \\"broke the rules\\" and penetrated into Tamaulipas. His organization began to kill police officers‚Äîforcing many to take a side with or against him‚Äîand assassinating rival cartel members. The Mexican Armed Forces and the program M√©xico Seguro were unable to put down the violence. For the first time in many years, the Mexican State was limited in its actions‚Äîand even surpassed‚Äîby the criminal organizations. The Sinaloa Cartel stood to its firm intention to become the \\"hegemonic drug trafficking organization in Mexico.\\" And to do so, it had to control the cities along the U.S.-Mexico border. Back in the early 2000s, if a different drug trafficking organization wanted to traffic narcotics through a different corridor, they had to pay a fee to the cartel that controlled it. Hence, it often resulted in a high prize, since Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n \\"knew how much every millimeter in his turf cost.\\" No drug trafficking organization before the Sinaloa cartel had dared to take on the Gulf Cartel. But Juan Jos√© Esparragoza Moreno and El Chapo Guzm√°n were persuasive in moving on into Nuevo Laredo and the rest of Tamaulipas. One of the first steps in the war between the Gulf and Sinaloa cartels began when Arturo Beltr√°n Leyva, alias El Barbas, hired Dionisio Rom√°n Garc√≠a (El Chacho), the leader of a gang who operated in Nuevo Laredo under the permission of Osiel in 2002. Nevertheless, El Chacho turned against the Osiel and the Gulf organization by deciding to work for the Sinaloa cartel and killing a Zeta member. This triggered a series of attacks and executions in Tamaulipas. And, in order to put down the violence, El Barbas sought Arturo Guzm√°n Decena, one of the founders of Los Zetas, and told him that he \\"did not want any problems\\" with the Zetas, and that he would do his best to turn in El Chacho. Guzm√°n Decena accepted his apology, but told him that if anyone from the Sinaloa cartel wanted to traffic drugs inside the Gulf Cartel's territory, they had to be unarmed and under supervision. In May 2002, El Chacho was kidnapped in the city of Monterrey by members of Los Zetas, and eventually found dead in Tamaulipas, bearing signs of torture. El Barbas then asked Osiel if Edgar Valdez Villarreal (La Barbie) could replace El Chacho, and he accepted. Los Zetas, however, were not convinced nor happy with Osiel's decision, because for them, \\"a betrayal is a betrayal.\\" Fifteen days after the capture of Osiel, Valdez Villarreal called Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano (who had taken the lead of Los Zetas after the death of Guzm√°n Decena in 2002) and said: \\"You have a week to leave the territories from Reynosa to Nuevo Laredo.\\" With this, the war had started. 2012 incursions =17 April 2012 massacre= Dismembered remains of 14 men were found in several plastic bags inside a Chrysler Voyager in the border city of Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas on 17 April 2012. All of those killed were between the ages of 30 and 35. Mexican officials stated that they found a \\"messaged signed by a criminal group,\\" but they did not release the content of the note, nor if those killed were members of Los Zetas or of the Gulf Cartel. CNNM√©xico stated that the message left behind by the criminal group said that they were going to \\"clean up Nuevo Laredo\\" by killing Zeta members. The Monitor newspaper, however, said that a source outside law enforcement but with direct knowledge of the attacks stated the 14 bodies belonged to members of Los Zetas who had been killed by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, now a branch of the Sinaloa Cartel. Following the attacks, the Sinaloa cartel's kingpin, Joaqu√≠n Guzm√°n Loera‚Äîbetter known as El Chapo Guzm√°n‚Äîsent a message to Los Zetas that they will fight for the control of the Nuevo Laredo plaza. The message read the following: Nuevo Laredo is considered a stronghold of Los Zetas, although there were incursions by the Sinaloa Cartel in March 2012. Consequently, Los Zetas responded two days later with incursions to Sinaloa, the home state of the Sinaloa Cartel. The Sinaloa Cartel's first attempt to take over Nuevo Laredo happened in 2005, when Los Zetas was working as the armed wing of the Gulf Cartel. ;InSight Crime analysis Front page of the killings in Nuevo Laredo. The \\"40\\" in the message is a reference to Miguel Trevi√±o Morales, a top leader of Los Zetas based in Nuevo Laredo, and longtime adversary of El Chapo Guzm√°n. The \\"H\\" is presumably H√©ctor Beltr√°n Leyva, the last remaining brother of the Beltr√°n Leyva Cartel. The Beltr√°n Leyva organization, unlike the Zetas, has presence in Sinaloa state, and would probably have an easier time attacking the Sinaloa Cartel on its own turf. The message does not mention the fact that the Gulf Cartel is probably supporting the Sinaloa Cartel in carrying out the executions. In addition, the banner suggests that the alliance between Los Zetas and the Beltr√°n Leyva Cartel remains intact as of 2012 despite its losses it lived in 2008. The message also suggests the differences in the modus operandi of Los Zetas and the Sinaloa Cartel, because as authors of InSight Crime allege, the Zetas have a reputation of operating through extortions, kidnappings, robberies, and other illicit activities; in contrast, the Sinaloa Cartel is known simply for drug trafficking. (Both assertions are not wholly true, but often reflect a popular sentiment). Guzm√°n attempted to take over Nuevo Laredo after the capture of the Gulf Cartel leader, Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, in 2003. Nevertheless, Guzm√°n retreated after a few years of bloody turf wars. The Sinaloa Cartel's return to Nuevo Laredo, however, was seen again in March 2012 after Guzm√°n reportedly left several corpses and a message heralding his return. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Nuevo Laredo is the busiest border crossing in terms of truck crossings with over 1.7 million trucks a year, more than double than any other crossing in the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. Nuevo Laredo is the fourth- busiest border crossing in terms of passenger vehicles. Patrick Corcoran of InSight Crime believes that the turf war in Nuevo Laredo will bring a huge wave of violence, but also mentioned that the circumstances have changed since the split of the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas in early 2010. The current alliance between Guzm√°n's Sinaloa Cartel and the Gulf Cartel may successfully extract Los Zetas and give El Chapo the upper hand. And once the Sinaloa Cartel gets established in Nuevo Laredo, it may possibly make moves to control Reynosa and Matamoros, Tamaulipas. ;Investigations On 24 April 2012, the attorney general of the state of Tamaulipas identified 10 of the 14 people killed. In addition, the Mexican authorities stated that those killed had \\"no relationship with the criminal group Los Zetas,\\" and that they were in fact innocent civilians. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection indicated that 7 out of the 14 who were killed were reportedly deported immigrants who were working illegally in the United States. The authorities said that the massacre was carried out to generate \\"psychosis,\\" because there is no concrete evidence of a \\"war between drug cartels\\" nor elements that indicate the presence of a group representing the Sinaloa Cartel in the border city of Nuevo Laredo. Some of the bodies have been returned to their families. The rest of the corpses have not been identified and remain in the Forensic Medical Services (SEMEFO). =4 May 2012 massacre= 23 bodies‚Äî14 of them decapitated and 9 of them hanged from a bridge‚Äîwere discovered in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, in an escalation of brutal violence involving rival drug gangs on the U.S. border. In the first incident, at around 1:00 am on 4 May 2012, nine people were hanged from a bridge on the Mexican Federal Highway 85D with a message left behind by the killers. Horrified motorists encountered the blood-stained bodies of four women and five men hanging off a bridge. The banner left behind reportedly stated that those killed were the perpetrators of the car bomb in the city on 24 April 2012. In addition, the 9 people who were hanged on the bridge were reportedly members of the Gulf Cartel who were killed by Los Zetas for \\"heating up\\" their turf. The message read the following: In the second incident, which occurred hours later, 14 decapitated bodies were abandoned inside a vehicle in front of the Customs Agency; the severed heads were left inside several ice coolers in front of the municipal palace. The Mexican police said the second massacre could have been an act of revenge by the Gulf Cartel to Los Zetas for the earlier killings. Along with the decapitated bodies was a message allegedly signed by Joaqu√≠n Guzm√°n Loera, where he demanded the municipality mayor of Nuevo Laredo, Benjam√≠n Galv√°n, along with other municipal and state leaders and public safety officials to recognize the Sinaloa cartel's presence in the area and stop insisting he is not in the city. The message read the following: Car bomb attacks At around 8:00 a.m. on 24 April 2012 in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, a car bomb exploded outside the city's police department. When the Mexican military arrived at the area of the explosion, they engaged in a confrontation with cartel members who shot them upon their arrival. There was one civilian who was injured as a result of the car bomb. The Blog del Narco credited the attacks to Joaqu√≠n Guzm√°n Loera (a.k.a. El Chapo), who reportedly left another message for Los Zetas about the Sinaloa cartel's incursion in Nuevo Laredo. Car bomb explosion outside the city hall in Nuevo Laredo. In the second incident, suspected members of a drug trafficking organization opened fire at a hotel that the Federal police was using as barracks on 23 May 2012, and then set off a car bomb in front of the police dormitories. A Chevrolet pickup truck exploded at around 5:30 a.m. inside the parking lot of Hotel Santa Cecilia in southern Nuevo Laredo, injuring 2 civilians and 8 police officers. The blast was strong enough to partially damage several rooms in the hotel and a couple of vehicles. Three of the ten police officers were wounded with third degree burns in half of their bodies, while the rest were treated for non-life-threatening wounds. Many residents living in Nuevo Laredo and across the international border in Laredo, Texas were reportedly awaken by the car explosion. Some Laredo residents also began calling 9-1-1 early in the morning as the cartel battles in Nuevo Laredo reached their peak. One resident even said that the explosions in Nuevo Laredo made his house shake across the border. Soon after the attacks, the Mexican Army put up a military checkpoint in the avenue where the hotel is situated. In addition, this attack was the first attack directed to Tamaulipas' new state police force, which took over the duties of the municipal police forces that were considered ineffective and corrupt. The authorities in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas believe that Los Zetas, one of Mexico's most powerful criminal groups, carried out the attack. Los Zetas are known for carrying out a number of attacks, but this one was described as \\"one of the most elaborate.\\" A third car bomb was abandoned on 29 June 2012 in front of the municipal palace at around 11:00 a.m., and exploded just below the office of Benjam√≠n Galv√°n G√≥mez, the mayor of Nuevo Laredo. Explosives were planted inside a gray Ford Ranger pickup truck, damaging more than ten vehicles that were parked near the car bomb and destroying dozens of windows in its surroundings. The detonation was heard on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. Laredo police said they received calls from several residents reporting an explosion, and dispatched officiers to the international bridges in the Texan city. A plume of smoke was seen from the U.S. side too. In addition, seven people who were near the explosion were injured. The Federal police and the Mexican Army cordoned the crime scene, as paramedics stabilized the bystanders and transported them to the nearest hospital. The Mexican authorities believe this car bomb attack was a form of \\"expression\\" by the criminal syndicates who operate in Nuevo Laredo and want to make their presence known. The state of Tamaulipas pledged to intensify the security measures in Nuevo Laredo. Attacks against the media On 19 March 2004, journalist Roberto Javier Mora Garc√≠a was stabbed 26 times outside his home in Nuevo Laredo. On 6 February 2006, two armed men broke into the offices of El Ma√±ana and detonated a grenade. They also shot the outside walls of the installation with AK-47s and AR-15s before fleeing the scene. According to La Jornada, the armed men shot the installation more than 100 times, injuring Jaime Orozco Tey, a journalist. On 30 July 2010, a group of armed men in a vehicle threw a grenade at the offices of Televisa in Nuevo Laredo, damaging two vehicles. On 26 September 2011, Mar√≠a Elizabeth Mac√≠as Castro, an editor of la Primera Hora newspaper, was decapitated; a note was left behind by Los Zetas, claiming responsibility for the killing. The message read the following: \\"For those who don't want to believe, this happened to [Mar√≠a Elizabeth Mac√≠as Castro] because of [her] actions, for believing in the army and the navy. Thank you for your attention, respectfully, Los Zetas. =Attacks against bloggers and social media users= On 13 September 2011, a man and a woman in their early twenties were hanged from a pedestrian bridge in Nuevo Laredo. Their fingers and ears were mutilated, and both bore signs of torture. The signs left behind declared that the pair were killed for posting denouncements of the drug cartel activities on the Internet. The message read: \\"This is going to happen to all of those posting funny things on the Internet,\\" one sign said. \\"You better (expletive) pay attention. I'm about to get you.\\" The killing was carried out by Los Zetas. On 9 November 2011, a blogger was tortured and decapitated for allegedly denouncing against the organized crime groups online. The man killed reportedly used the username \\"Rascatripa\\" in the site known as Nuevo Laredo en Vivo, where civilians post on the activities of Los Zetas. The killers left another message on top of the corpse stating the following: \\"Hello! I'm Rascatripas and this happened to me for failing to understand that I should not report things on social media websites. With this last report I bid farewell to Nuevo Laredo en Vivo.\\" This man was the fourth killed by the cartels for posting against them on the Internet in less than two months. The brutal killings sent \\"shock waves\\" to the online community, and Twitter users from Nuevo Laredo, Reynosa, and the Rio Grande Valley, along with other border communities, issued a joint statement asking for protection in November 2011. The bloggers asked the Mexican government to solve the murders and protect freedom of speech. Even the \\"hacker group\\" known as Anonymous stepped in and gave recommendations to the community in Nuevo Laredo to \\"be careful\\" when denouncing Los Zetas. =Cartels silence the media= In another incident, a group of armed men attacked the offices of El Ma√±ana newspaper at around 23:00 hours on 11 May 2012. The Mexican authorities stated that no one was injured in the 5-minute shootout, but the offices and some vehicles were damaged when bullets impacted from the outside. When the employees of El Ma√±ana heard the detonations, they threw themselves on the floor, while others suffered nervous breakdowns. Some witnesses mentioned that they heard grenade explosions during the attack. In addition, a message was reportedly left behind by the perpetrators. The damage was minimal, but the message was understood. El Ma√±ana took the attack as a warning from the Sinaloa Cartel that it wants coverage claiming that they are taking over Nuevo Laredo and beating Los Zetas, therefore making the Sinaloa cartel look \\"tough\\" and Los Zetas \\"look weak.\\" The problem is that if the journalists decide to favor the Sinaloa cartel or Los Zetas, they will find themselves threatened by one of the cartels. In other words, one cartel threatens if there isn't coverage (Sinaloa cartel) and the other cartel threatens if there is coverage (Los Zetas). Following the attacks, El Ma√±ana declared that it will no longer report on news relating to drug-violence. They may in fact be the first newspaper to publicly step down and stop covering all crime incidents involving stories of mafia groups fighting for control. The day that the editorial stepped down, 49 decapitated bodies were found along a highway near Monterrey, Mexico's third largest city, and just 120 miles south of Nuevo Laredo. Most newspapers covered this incident, but El Ma√±ana did not. Again, on 10 June 2012, El Ma√±ana suffered another grenade attack but only material damages were reported. In response to the attacks, the newspaper issued the following message to the public: Many Mexicans have been relying on social media chatrooms and sites like Facebook and Twitter as traditional media \\"self-censor in the face of cartel violence.\\" Moreover, due to the violent attacks the press has received in Nuevo Laredo, news media have practiced \\"self-censorship,\\" where local journalist prefer to silence the press and refuse to report on important incidents for fears of reprisals by the cartels. Events that would go on the front-page of any newspaper‚Äîmass murders with over six dead, shooting incidents wounding three soldiers‚Äîoften go unreported in Nuevo Laredo. The cartels want the cities they control to appear calm in order to prevent the government from sending federal troops. Consequently, the press, tired of extortions and death threats, prefers to go silent because there is no guarantee for their safety. Attacks against casinos On 21 May 2012, the Mexican authorities were alerted that a casino was on fire in Nuevo Laredo. At around six in the morning, an anonymous call alerted the police that smoke was coming from a building. By 8:00 a.m. the fire had been put down, but a portion of the casino was consumed by the flames. Nonetheless, only material damages were reported. Inside the casino were several containers holding large amounts of gasoline, which helped the authorities conclude that the arson was intentional. The 'Amazonas' casino, as it was known, opened in February 2010; however, it was closed in March 2012 for operating illegally. According to the Blog del Narco, several people from Nuevo Laredo knew that the casino was owned by Los Zetas. The article was also mentioned that the Zetas ordered the closure of another casino known as 'El Juega Juega' to benefit 'Amazonas.' Three days later on 24 May 2012, the 'Maranho' nightclub, considered among the most popular in Nuevo Laredo, was set on fire between 2:00 and 3:00 a.m. And according to unofficial accounts, a group of gunmen were the perpetrators, while some accounts mention that they used grenades and bombs. The nightclub was \\"completely destroyed,\\" but no victims were reported. Other grenade explosions were heard across the border in Laredo, Texas, while the residents turned to #LaredoFollow hashtag on Twitter to report on the violence.

The ship was made famous by Alex Haley's novel, Roots: The Saga of an American Family, in which it brought his ancestor, Kunta Kinte, from The Gambia to the colonial United States.  Construction  Lord Ligonier was originally laid down in 1763. The ship was built for hauling cargo such as slaves, tobacco, spice, and lumber. In June 1765 the ship's owner, Horace Andrews, hired a crew of 40 men and a captain named Davies. The ship had six decks in all, four for carrying slaves and two for hauling spice, lumber, and tobacco. Lord Ligonier was a sailing ship, built to weather Atlantic storms. It could carry 170 slaves, 40 crew members, and various amounts of other cargo. Although it could carry 170 slaves if they were packed in sideways, the ship's capacity was reduced to 140 when they lay on their backs.  1766 voyage and Roots  Lord Ligonier visited the Gambia at least once before the slave trading voyage for which she became famous. In April 1766 she was reported to have returned from there with dispatches from Governor Debatt of Fort James reporting that the French were establishing armed factories on the coast in violation of their treaty undertakings.\\"News\\". St. James's Chronicle or the British Evening Post (London, England), April 24, 1766 - April 26, 1766; Issue 803. Captain Thomas Davis sailed from London on 17 July 1766 and arrived in Africa on 13 September. Lord Ligonier acquired her slaves at the Gambia and sailed from Africa on 5 July 1767. She arrived at Annapolis on 29 September. She had embarked 140 slaves and she arrived with 96. She had left London with 26 crew members and she arrived with 18. She arrived back in London on 25 January 1768. A surviving advertisement records the arrival of the ship with a cargo of slaves at Annapolis in 1767. The ship was the basis for Alex Haley's assertion in his novel, Roots: The Saga of an American Family, that his ancestor, Kunta Kinte, was brought on that voyage. The miniseries based on the book invented a failed slave uprising during the voyage. This is the only voyage of the Lord Ligonier recorded in the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade Database. Fate Lord Ligoniers subsequent fate is unknown. There is proof that it sailed on another slave voyage but nothing is known of it. The ship did not appear in the 1776 volume of Lloyd's Register.

Life Zhuge Xu was from Yangdu County (), Langya Commandery (), which is in present-day Yinan County, Shandong. He was probably a distant relative of other famous Zhuges in the Three Kingdoms period, such as Zhuge Jin, Zhuge Liang and Zhuge Dan, since he shared the same ancestral home as them. He served in the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period. In 255, when the Wei generals Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin started a rebellion in Shouchun (Â£ΩÊò•; present-day Shou County, Anhui), Zhuge Xu was then serving as the Administrator () of Taishan Commandery (Ê≥∞Â±±ÈÉ°; around present-day Tai'an, Shandong). He led troops from Taishan Commandery to assist other Wei imperial forces led by the regent Sima Shi to suppress the rebellion. Zhuge Xu was later promoted to the position of Inspector () of Yong Province in an unknown year. In 263, he participated in the campaign against one of Wei's rival states, Shu. His mission was to lead 30,000 troops to block the Shu general Jiang Wei at a bridge in Yinping () and stop him from reinforcing Yang'an Pass (). When Jiang Wei heard about it, he pretended to launch an attack on Yong Province via Konghan Valley (). Zhuge Xu fell for the ruse, thought that Jiang Wei wanted to attack his base, so he ordered his troops to retreat from Yinping by 30 li. Jiang Wei then seized the opportunity to cross the bridge at Yinping. When Zhuge Xu found out and tried to stop Jiang Wei, he was already one day behind time. Later, the Wei general Zhong Hui advanced south from Yang'an Pass and reached Baishui (). At the time, another Wei general Deng Ai wanted to link up with Zhuge Xu and attack the enemy position at Jiangyou () together, but Zhuge Xu refused and moved to Baishui to join Zhong Hui instead. At Baishui, Zhong Hui accused Zhuge Xu of cowardice, seized command of his troops and sent him as a prisoner back to Yong Province. Zhuge Xu later served in the Jin dynasty (265‚Äì420), which replaced the Cao Wei state in 265 after the regent Sima Yan usurped the throne from the last Wei emperor Cao Huan. He served as Minister of Ceremonies () and Minister of the Guards () under the Jin government.

Directed by Herbert Brenon, the screenplay was written by Elizabeth Meehan and Louis Stevens, based on the play, The Dove by Willard Mack, which was itself based on a magazine article by Gerald Beaumont. The film is a remake of the 1927 silent film, The Dove, starring Norma Talmadge. Plot South of the U.S. border, Don Jos√© Tostado, a Mexican cabellero, falls in love with Dolores Romero, a dance-hall girl. Owning one of the larger ranches in the area, Tostado is not used to people telling him no. When Romero resists his advances, using a fictional boyfriend as her excuse, this only increases his interest in her, and his attempts to win her favor. As part of that attempt, he plans to throw a gala in her honor. Meanwhile, Romero falls for Johnny Powell, a dealer at a nearby casino. She confides in him that she has no interest in Tostado, but doesn't know how to get him to leave her alone. Powell offers to take her away and get married. They make their plans, but before they can carry them out, Tostado learns of them and hatches a plot of his own: he frames Powell for a murder and has him arrested. When Dolores hears that Tostado has paid the jailer to kill Johnny during an escape attempt, she makes a deal with Tostado to give herself to him in exchange for Johnny's life and freedom. Tostado agrees. When Johnny is freed, Dolores makes it clear that she is no longer interested in him, and that she intends to marry Tostado. Dolores leaves with Tostado, heading for his ranch. On the way, she attempts to commit suicide, but is stopped by Tostado, who is startled to discover that she would rather be dead than be stuck with him for the rest of her life. When they arrive back at his hacienda, they are surprised by Johnny, who fights Tostado. When they police arrive, they arrest Johnny, and are ready to execute him summarily, on Tostado's orders. Dolores intercedes on Johnny's behalf, and her pleas have their desired effect. Realizing that he's beaten, Tostado calls off the police, and lets Dolores leave with Johnny. Cast * Dolores del R√≠o as Dolores Romero * Leo Carrillo as Don Jos√© Tostado * Norman Foster as Johnny Powell * Stanley Fields as Mike Marovich * Frank Campeau as Bill * Lucille Webster Gleason as Madame Double Chin * Ralph Ince as O'Grady * Edna Murphy as Madge Production The short story, \\"The Blue Ribbon\\", written by Gerald Beaumont, was printed in Red Book Magazine in their January 1923 issue. Willard Mack used that story as the basis for his play, The Dove, which was produced by David Belasco on Broadway at the Empire Theatre, premiering on August 24, 1925. In the leads were Judith Anderson as Dolores, Holbrook Blinn as Tostado, and William Harrigan as Johnny. In 1927 United Artists purchased the rights to the play, and produced a silent version of Mack's play, The Dove, starring Norma Talmadge, Noah Beery, Sr., and Gilbert Roland. RKO Pictures purchased the rights in 1931. The film was in production from September to November 1931. The film was Dolores del R√≠o's first feature for RKO Pictures. Notes In 1939, RKO would remake the film, this time under the title The Girl and the Gambler, starring Tim Holt as Johnny and Steffi Duna as Dolores. Carillo would reprise his role as the Don, although this time the character's name would be El Rayo.

Early biography Antonin Cloche was from a rich French family. Formation Cloche entered the Dominican Order in the Province of Toulouse. Career Under the masterships of Juan Tom√°s de Rocaberti and Antonio de Monroy Cloche served as the master's envoy to the Kingdom of France. Cloche was unanimously elected master at the Dominican chapter held in 1686 at Rome after the death of the previous master de Monroy. In 1696, Cloche started the process for the canonisation of Pope Pius VPaolo Alessandro Maffei, Vita di S. Pio Quinto, Rome 1712. and soon had a magnificent sarcophagus made for him in the Sistine Chapel in Santa Maria Maggiore by the sculptor Pierre Le Gros the Younger. Shortly before the death of his friend Cardinal Girolamo Casanate in 1700, Cloche set out to build a library for the substantial collection of books he was to leave to the Dominicans. The Biblioteca Casanatense, attached to the Convent of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome, was inaugurated in 1701. Already in 1717 it transpired that the library was too small, so Cloche had an extension built from 1719 but did not live to see its completion in 1721.Gerhard Schuster, Zu Ehren Casanates. P√®re Cloches Kunstauftr√§ge in der Fr√ºhzeit der Biblioteca Casanatense, in: Mitteilungen des Kunsthistorischen Institutes in Florenz 35, 1991, p. 323-336. As master, he was a proponent of popular preaching along the lines of the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament. Jansenism and Gallicanism continued spreading in the French order during his mastership. He lived as a great lord, hosting many ecclesiastical dignitaries at his country house in San Pastore. He died in 1720 aged 92. In his honour, in 1721 his relief portrait by Bernardino Cametti was placed in old entrance to the Biblioteca Casanatense (now no longer part of the library and only accessible through the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva). Patron of the arts Cloche was eager to promote the status of the Dominicans by means of art. His sculptor of choice was Le Gros who was a rising star in 1697-98 when he produced the Sarcophagus for Pope Pius V. It was probably Cloche's secretary, the painter Fr√®re Baptiste Monnoyer, a friend of Le Gros' from student days in Paris, who acted as a go- between. Following Casanate's death, Le Gros was immediately commissioned to create the cardinal's tomb in the Lateran Basilica (1700‚Äì1703) and subsequently his honorary statue in the Biblioteca Casanatense (1706‚Äì1708). When Pope Clement XI offered the many niches in Saint Peter's to the religious orders to erect a statue to their founders, Cloche jumped at the opportunity and commissioned the Statue of Saint Dominic from Le Gros (1702‚Äì1706). No other order saw the necessity to hurry, which made Saint Dominic the very first and for decades the only monumental statue of a founder in Saint Peter's.

During the siege William Pote was taken prisoner and wrote one of the rare captivity narratives that exist from Nova Scotia and Acadia.  Historical context  The conquest of Acadia by Great Britain began with the 1710 capture of the provincial capital, Port Royal (which the British renamed Annapolis Royal. In the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, France formally ceded Acadia to Britain. However, there was disagreement about the provincial boundaries, and some Acadians also resisted British rule. During King George's War, the French began to retake what the British called Nova Scotia with an assault on the capital. There were only two British outposts in the colony: Canso and Annapolis Royal. The French under the command of Devier immediately defeated Canso and then made an unsuccessful attempt on the capital. The French made another attempt on the capital the following year.  Siege  Within days of New England starting to lay siege to Louisbourg, French officer Paul Marin de la Malgue led 200 troops, and hundreds of Mi'kmaq on a three-week siege against the British at Annapolis Royal. This force was twice the size of French officer Duvivier's expedition against Annapolis Royal the previous year. During the siege the English destroyed their own officers fences, houses and buildings that the attackers might be able to use. Marin captured two schooners and took one prisoner. The siege was ended when Marin was recalled to assist with defending the French during the Siege of Louisbourg (1745) and commodore Edward Tyng arrived to raise the siege.  Consequences  Commodor Edward Tyng by Joseph Blackburn During the Siege, the Mi'kmaq and Maliseet took prisoner William Pote and some of Gorham's Rangers. (John Gorham himself was not at Annapolis because he was fighting alongside his father in the Siege of Louisbourg). During his captivity, Pote wrote one of the most important captivity narratives from Acadia and Nova Scotia. While at Cobequid, Pote reported that an Acadian said that the French soldiers should have \\"left their [the English] carcasses behind and brought their skins.\\" The following year, among other places, Pote was taken to the Maliseet village Aukpaque on the Saint John River. While at the village, Mi'kmaq from Nova Scotia arrived and, on July 6, 1745, tortured him and a Mohawk ranger from Gorham's company named Jacob, as retribution for the killing of their family members by Ranger John Gorham during the Siege of Annapolis Royal (1744). On July 10, Pote witnessed another act of revenge when the Mi'kmaq tortured a Mohawk ranger from Gorham's company at Meductic. Martin was not able to assist Louisbourg because the New Englanders stopped him in the Naval battle off Tatamagouche. Grand Pre had been the staging ground for the French and Mi'kmaq sieges of Annapolis Royal. This led Gorham to demand to take control of Grand Pre after the first siege in 1744 and again after the second.Bates, p. 33, 41 The French made one final attempt with the Duc d‚ÄôAnville Expedition to regain Annapolis Royal.

Gubbins (born 27 January 1937) is a British born American chemical engineer who is the W.H. Clark Distinguished University Professor of Chemical Engineering at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering in the chemistry section.  Biography  Keith E. Gubbins was born in Southampton, England, and spent most of his childhood there. He began his academic training at Queen Mary College in the University of London, where he received his BSc in Chemistry with First Class honours in 1958. He went on to receive his PhD degree in Chemical Engineering from King's College at the University of London in 1962. The topic of his doctoral research, which was largely experimental, was the kinetics of reactions in fluidised beds. He then joined the University of Florida in Gainesville as a postdoctoral fellow to work on the mass transport of gases in fuel cells with Robert D. Walker. In 1964 he became an assistant professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Florida, and then moved rapidly through the ranks to become a full professor in 1972. On joining the Florida faculty, he was asked to teach thermodynamics, and this led to his interest in statistical mechanics of fluids. Much of his early interest in statistical mechanics was focused on the diffusion and solubility of gases in electrolyte solutions. While at University of Florida he co-authored, with the late Tim Reed, Applied Statistical Mechanics (McGraw-Hill, 1973), the first such text aimed at practical applications to fluids, with a particular orientation towards chemical engineering. In 1973 very few chemical engineers were aware of the potential of statistical mechanics in their field. It was also during his time at Florida that he began a long and very productive collaboration with Chris Gray and Peter Egelstaff at the University of Guelph in Canada. This began as a result of a sabbatical leave spent with Egelstaff, the leading expert in neutron scattering from liquids, a topic Keith was eager to become familiar with. In 1976 he moved to Cornell University as the Thomas R. Briggs Professor of Engineering, where he spent the next 22 years, serving 7 years as Director of the School of Chemical Engineering there (1983‚Äì1990). At Cornell he was a member of the Graduate Fields of Chemistry, Applied Physics, Applied Mathematics and History of Science, in addition to Engineering. During his period as Director he led a successful effort to raise funds for a renovation of all of the teaching and research laboratories, and was responsible for hiring seven new faculty members. While at Cornell, Keith established a style of conducting research that has become synonymous with him. Using the resources of Cornell and those of various funding agencies he built a vibrant international collaborative laboratory in statistical mechanics and molecular modelling, to which he welcomed many international visiting scientists. It was while at Cornell that he teamed up with a fellow faculty member, William ('Bill') B. Streett, an internationally renowned expert in high-pressure phase equilibria and molecular simulation of fluids. It was from Bill that he learned about the potential of molecular simulation methods. Together they formed a successful joint program involving experimental and theoretical studies of liquid mixtures. In 1998 he moved to North Carolina State University as the W.H. Clark Distinguished University Professor.  Research interests  Following his largely experimental studies in his doctoral and postdoctoral research, his interests turned increasingly to the application of statistical mechanics to problems in chemical engineering and applied physics. Much of chemical engineering involves the handling and processing of dense fluids and liquids, so that a knowledge of their thermodynamic and transport behaviour is essential to design of process equipment. It was to these areas that he addressed himself, and he has been largely responsible for the introduction of statistical mechanics and atomistic simulation methods (Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics) into chemical engineering. His research has focused on the development of reliable predictive methods based in statistical mechanics for phase and chemical equilibria for mixtures; equations of state for complex fluid mixtures, particularly those involving associating liquids and polymers; thermodynamics, transport in interfaces, including small droplets, gas-liquid and liquid-liquid interfaces and nano-porous media; prediction of viscosity, diffusion coefficients, and thermal conductivities; natural gas storage in porous media. Among his most significant contributions are the development of much improved equations of state for complex fluids and fluid mixtures, based on statistical mechanical perturbation theory. During the 1960s Barker, Henderson and others had developed a successful perturbation theory for liquids composed of spherical molecules. While this was a milestone, such simple liquids play very almost no role in chemical engineering processes, which involve mixtures containing molecules that are non-spherical, polar, associating and so on. In 1972 Keith, together with Chris Gray of Guelph, proposed a perturbation theory for liquids of non- spherical molecules, and then applied it to more complex mixtures, including polar liquids. This led to many joint papers over the coming decade in which the theory was tested and successfully applied to a wide range of liquid mixtures. However, there still remained an important limitation, the failure of these existing theories to describe molecular association due to strongly attractive forces, such as hydrogen bonding. In the late 1980s Michael Wertheim developed a highly successful theory for dense fluids in which the molecules exhibited association to form complexing, through hydrogen-bonding, charge transfer and other mechanisms. In 1989 Keith, together with co-workers Walter Chapman, George Jackson and Mac Radosz, proposed an equation of state, which they termed statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT), that combined the merits of Werheim's associating liquid theory with a perturbation treatment that described the non-polar interactions. The theory proved to be both accurate and highly versatile, encompassing mixtures containing non- polar, associating and chain molecules, including polymers. Unlike most existing equations of state at that time, SAFT has a firm foundation in statistical mechanics, and works well for strongly associated liquids. It was quickly embraced by many researchers and industries, who went on to apply it to polymers, liquid crystals, electrolytes, surfactant solutions and interfaces. The SAFT equation is now widely used worldwide, in both industry and academia, and has become the standard approach in describing complex mixtures. He was among the first to realise and exploit the power of statistical mechanical treatments for the adsorption of gases and liquids in nano-porous materials (such as carbons, silicas and metal-organic framework materials). Such adsorption processes are central to many separation and purification processes, as well as catalysis. The density functional theory method developed by Gubbins and coworkers is now universally used in analysing adsorption isotherms to calculate pore size distributions and porosity of nano-porous materials. More recently he has made major contributions to the characterisation of amorphous porous materials through application of statistical mechanical methods, and to the understanding of diffusion processes and chemical reactions in these materials. Keith is the author or co-author of approximately 500 research publications in refereed scientific journals. These, together with his 4 books,Reed, Thomas McKennan, and Keith E. Gubbins. \\"Applied statistical mechanics.\\" (1973). have received more than 36,000 citations.  Awards and recognition  He has received numerous awards for his research.

The conference took place from Monday 26 November to Saturday 8 December 2012, at the Qatar National Convention Centre in Doha. The conference reached an agreement to extend the life of the Kyoto Protocol, which had been due to expire at the end of 2012, until 2020, and to reify the 2011 Durban Platform, meaning that a successor to the Protocol is set to be developed by 2015 and implemented by 2020. Wording adopted by the conference incorporated for the first time the concept of \\"loss and damage\\", an agreement in principle that richer nations could be financially responsible to other nations for their failure to reduce carbon emissions. Background President of the conference Abdullah Bin Hamad Al- Attiyah (center) and Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres (left) at COP18 The United Nations Climate Change Conferences are annual multi-lateral meetings of governments held in different locations around the world under the sponsorship of the United Nations that serve as a forum for countries to discuss climate change matters. The conferences seek to address the threat of global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide. Between 2000 and 2011 carbon dioxide growth in the atmosphere was 20% of the total concentration growth since prehistoric level (391,57 ppm in 2011 and 369,52 ppm in 2000)USE OF NOAA ESRL DATA The concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere has reached 391 ppm (parts per million) NOAA Mauna Loa dataset (reported online at: http://co2now.org/ ) versus the pre-industrial concentration was 280 ppmEtheridge, D.

The conferences are attended by dignitaries and sometimes heads of state from most countries and generally draw significant activity by various environmental advocacy groups. Consequently, the conferences are generally well covered by the world media agencies. The 2012 conference is held at the Qatar National Convention Centre in Doha, and with a projected attendance of 17,000 participants it is expected to be the largest conference to have ever been held in Qatar. The conference is casually called the COP18/CMP 8 conference but these are technically different but closely related and sometimes integrated conferences. In 2012, the UNFCCC conference serves as an umbrella for seven concurrent and interrelated meeting groups collectively called the Doha 2012 UNFCCC conference.https://caps-conference.eu/2012-united- nations-climate-change-conference/ The main conference is also preceded by several topical pre-sessions. Pre-sessions to the 2012 UNFCCC conference # 70th meeting of the Clean Development Mechanism Executive Board (19 to 23 November) # Least Developed Countries Preparatory Meetings (20 to 21 November) # Small Island Developing States Preparatory Meetings (22 to 23 November) # African Group Preparatory Meetings (22 to 23 November) # Informal pre- sessional meeting of Parties to exchange further views on the possible recommendations on loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change(24 November) # G7 & China Preparatory Meetings (24 to 25 November) Concurrent conferences under the umbrella of the 2012 UNFCCC conference The Doha 2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference is an agglomeration of multiple related conferences being conducted roughly in parallel and in a semi-integrated fashion over the two weeks that the conference is in session: # Eighteenth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 18) # Eighth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 8) # Thirty-seventh session of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI 37) # Thirty-seventh session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and TechnologicalAdvice (SBSTA 37) # Seventeenth session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol (second part) (AWG-KP 17.2) # Fifteenth session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the convention (second part) (AWG-LCA 15.2) # First session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (second part) (ADP 1.2) Conference focus The conference focused on five aspects of climate change: * Adaptation ‚Äì social and other changes that must be undertaken to successfully adapt to climate change. Adaptation might encompass, but is not limited to, changes in agriculture and urban planning. * Finance ‚Äì how countries will finance adaptation to and mitigation of climate change, whether from public or private sources. * Mitigation ‚Äì steps and actions that the countries of the world can take to mitigate the effects of climate change. * Technology ‚Äì the technologies that are needed to adapt or mitigate climate change and ways in which developed countries can support developing countries in adopting them. * Loss and damage ‚Äì first articulated at the 2012 conference and in part based on the agreement that was signed at the 2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Cancun. It introduces the principle that countries vulnerable to the effects of climate change may be financially compensated in future by countries that fail to curb their carbon emissions.Roger Harrabin,\\"UN climate talks extend Kyoto Protocol, promise compensation\\", BBC News, 8 December 2012. Retrieved 13 October 2013. Conference structure The conference is generally a two-week conference consisting of the following activities: *Speeches from UN bureaucrats *Speeches from dignitaries and sometimes heads of state *Closed working sessions by various working groups *Open breakouts and working sessions by various working groups *Announcements by countries on a particular position *Announcements of agreements by UN bureaucrats The conference will sometimes see late night (or all night) working sessions when diplomats cannot agree to the terms and conditions of agreements and sometimes staged walk-outs by some parties is not uncommon. The last several conferences of this type have suffered from impasses in the first week and a half of talks, followed by a series of rounds of very late night discussions, sometimes followed by an extension of the conference which finally yields a modest progress agreement. External to the conference, the conference generally attracts well organized protests, rallies and demonstrations by various environmental groups urging the participants to reach agreement on the topic of climate change policy. In recent conferences, some activist groups have given daily informal awards to countries that they see as advancing or detracting from their particular ideological position. Conference outcomes The Conference produced a package of documents collectively titled The Doha Climate Gateway over objections from Russia and other countries at the session. The documents collectively contained: # An eight-year extension of the Kyoto Protocol until 2020 limited in scope to only 15% of the global carbon dioxide emissions due to the lack of participation of Canada, Japan, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, New Zealand and the United States and due to the fact that developing countries like China (the world's largest emitter), India and Brazil are not subject to any emissions reductions under the Kyoto Protocol. # Language on loss and damage, formalized for the first time in the conference documents. # The conference made little progress towards the funding of the Green Climate Fund. Russia, Belarus and Ukraine objected at the end of the session, as they have a right to under the session's rules. In closing the conference, the President said that he would note these objections in his final report. Reaction to the conference outcomes Reaction to the conference outcomes was characterized as \\"modest, at best\\" by NPR. Kieren Keke, Foreign Minister of Nauru and the representative of the Alliance of Small Island States at the conference,\\"Climat : le Qatar arrache un accord √† Doha, Moscou d√©nonce la m√©thode\\", Le Monde, 8 December 2012 was quoted by the BBC as saying, Others like Martin Khor of the South Center, an association of developing nations saw a more positive outcome, specifically regarding the Loss and Damage Mechanism: Jennifer Morgan of the World Resources Institute told NPR about the Loss and Damage Mechanism that: Regarding the path to the $100 billion in Green Climate Fund financing, Jennifer Morgan told NPR the following: Criticisms of the conference and UNFCCC Process The overall umbrella and processes of the UNFCCC and the adopted Kyoto Protocol have been criticized by some as not having achieved its stated goals of reducing the emission of carbon dioxide (the primary culprit blamed for rising global temperatures of the 21st century). At a speech given at his alma mater, Todd Stern ‚Äî the US Climate Change envoy ‚Äî has expressed the challenges with the UNFCCC process as follows, \\"Climate change is not a conventional environmental issue...It implicates virtually every aspect of a state's economy, so it makes countries nervous about growth and development. This is an economic issue every bit as it is an environmental one.\\" He went on to explain that, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is a multilateral body concerned with climate change and can be an inefficient system for enacting international policy. Because the framework system includes over 190 countries and because negotiations are governed by consensus, small groups of countries can often block progress. Participant statements and conference activity =Statement by UN climate chief Christiana Figueres= Governments will decide how and timetable to reach an effective universal climate agreement adopted in 2015 and to enter into force from 2020. Christiana Figueres, the UNFCCC executive secretary: \\"The necessary technology and policy tools are available to governments and societies, but time is very short ‚Äî only 36 months to reach a universal agreement before 2015. What we now need is to urgently implement the decisions that have been taken at the inter- governmental level and to further strengthen actions already under way,\\" she said.Doha conference seeks faster response to climate change Gulf Times =Statement by New Zealand Prime Minister John Key= The New Zealand government said it would not be signing up to a second commitment to the Kyoto Protocol, a decision criticised by the World Wildlife Fund. Prime Minister John Key said New Zealand would not lead the way on climate change, instead opting to be a \\"fast follower\\". =Statement by Philippine Envoy Naderev Sano= The Philippine Government called for urgent action to halt climate change, emphasizing their recent experience with a deadly typhoon and believing that countries may face more extreme weather disturbances frequently if climate change is left unchecked. \\"As we vacillate and procrastinate here, we are suffering. There is massive and widespread devastation back home. Heartbreaking tragedies like this are not unique to the Philippines.\\" said Philippine envoy Naderev Sano, who is a member of the Philippines' Climate Change Commission. =Statement by Japanese Masahiko Horie= \\"Only developed countries are legally bound by the Kyoto protocol and their emissions are only 26% [of global emissions]. If we continue the same, only one quarter of the world is legally bound and three-quarters of countries are not bound at all.\\"\\"UN: methane released from melting ice could push climate past tipping point\\". The Guardian 27 November 2012 =United Nations and UNEP: methane thawing from permafrost= The United Nations gave a strong warning on the threat to the climate from methane in the thawing permafrost. This has not yet been included in models of the future climate. Permafrost contain 1,700 gigatonnes of carbon ‚Äì twice the amount currently in the atmosphere. When it thaws, it could push global warming past one of the key \\"tipping points\\" that scientists believe could lead to runaway climate change. UNEP called IPCC to provide governments with the most up-to-date knowledge in the next IPCC reports next year. Non-participant statements =World Bank= World Bank published a report in November 2012 demanding the moral responsibility to take action on behalf of future generations. 4 ¬∞C warmer world must be avoided ‚Äì we need to hold warming below 2 ¬∞C. Even with the current mitigation commitments there is roughly a 20 percent likelihood of exceeding 4 ¬∞C by 2100.Why a 4 degree centrigrade warmer world must be avoided November 2012 World Bank The World Bank and the International Energy Agency warned that the world is heading for unprecedented warming ‚Äì of between 4 ¬∞C and 6 ¬∞C ‚Äì if trends are not reversed.

New Zealand received two 'Fossil of the Day' awards for \\"actively hampering international progress\\". =Friends of the Earth International= \\"An open letter to governments and their negotiators\\" posted on Friends of the Earth International's website stated, \\"To really address climate change UNFCCC-COP18 should decide to leave under the soil more than 2/3 of the fossil reserves.\\" =Greenpeace= Lauri Myllyvirta from Greenpeace Nordic states that the key reason we are heading for 4 ¬∞C of warming is coal burning. Massive expansion in the use of coal has caused more than two-thirds of the increase in global CO2 emissions in recent years. Also the World Bank made plea for governments to avoid 4 ¬∞C Warmer World. No new coal plants were constructed in Europe after 2007, but 1,200 coal plants are now being planned elsewhere: they can be stopped.Revealed: the coal industry's plan to devastate the climate Greenpeace, 23 November 2012 The EU spent two-thirds of its energy research funding on nuclear technologies in 2011. Some countries maintain direct subsidies to oil consumption and coal mining. Others are providing decisive economic benefits to nuclear, oil and gas installations by legislation socialising the costs of accidents and of decommissioning. According to Greenpeace removing these subsidies and imposing environmental taxes would increase the cost and price of old energy supplies, and make energy efficiency more profitable.Sweden report Greenpeace 12.11.2012 =Keepers of prosperity= Eren Swobodan of the German group \\"Keepers of prosperity - Bewahrer des Wohlstandes\\" criticized the inaction of the German government. He called for crime charges against people who express doubts on the scientific consensus. In an open letter to non-attendees of his group's 2012 meeting he wrote \\"the world can't afford another event like 2004 and 2007\\" and \\"everything has to be done to avoid it\\", but he also added for consideration that \\"they won't make it easy for us\\". According to Swobodan there is time until 2018, anything beyond that would be too late. In a national campaign published by several German newspapers the group showed heartbreaking pictures of children getting a sunburn and some more severe injuries from to the climate change-enhanced sunny weather in many parts of Germany. Although the campaign raised awareness of global warning in Germany and some German speaking parts of France and even 4 TV stations reported about it, some observers doubt whether it would convince enough politicians to \\"do what it takes to make it happen\\".

Exodus to Jazz paved the way for numerous other crossover successes during the '60s (many in the soul-jazz realm), and while that may not be a credibility- boosting trend to start, the music still speaks for itself\\".Ginell, R.

His artistic preoccupations include creative engagement with new technology, music created for non-expert performance and intercultural-interfaith dialogue.  Background and Training  Born in Dunedoo, in Central Western New South Wales, Greg Schiemer attended Holy Cross College, Ryde and finished high school in the Passionist minor seminary at St Ives and at the Sydney Technical College, Ultimo. He completed a B.Mus at Sydney University where he studied composition with Peter Sculthorpe to whom he owes an enduring interest in music from Asia and the world of Harry Partch. Through David Ahern, he discovered experimental music and in particular, the work of Cornelius Cardew and John Cage.Jenkins, John. 22 Contemporary Australian Composers. Melbourne: NMA Publications, 1988. www.rainerlinz.net/NMA/22CAC/schiemer.html The foundations of his work as composer and instrument-builder were laid while he was a musical collaborator of Philippa Cullen. Working with her electronic dance ensemble, he learned the craft of electronics under the tutelage of electronic engineer Phil Connor and organ builder Arthur Spring and between 1972 and 1975 together they built some of the earliest electronic music systems that react to dance movement. Between 1976 and 1981 he worked for Digital Equipment Australia, a division of Digital Equipment Corporation, initially in computer field service and later as senior design technician and in 1999 he was awarded a PhD in electronics from Macquarie University.Schiemer, Greg. MIDI Tool Box: An interactive system for music composition. PhD Thesis, Macquarie University. 1999.  Teaching and Research  He first taught electronic music composition at the Canberra School of Music from 1983, before moving in 1986 to the Sydney Conservatorium. There he mentored musicians working with new technology and participated in the activities of watt, the electro-acoustic group co-founded by composers Martin Wesley-Smith and Ian Fredericks. In 2003 he moved to the University of Wollongong where he supervised postgraduate composers and coordinated interdisciplinary research involving sound across a variety of disciplines within creative arts and informatics. He was also the lead chief investigator for Australian Research Council projects focused on mobile technology,(DP0346291) http://www.arc.gov.au/pdf/2003_DP_Org.pdf haptic instruments(LP0560335) http://www.arc.gov.au/pdf/LP05Rd1_ListingbyState_University.pdf and microtonal performance.(DP0773667) http://www.arc.gov.au/pdf/DP07/DP07_Uni_Wollongong.pdf  Instruments  His electronic instruments include: * Tupperware Gamelan (1977-1983) - a collection of instruments designed to be played by an ensemble of non-expert players. The instruments were so-named because electronics were mounted in plastic kitchenware while gamelan was a metaphor for collaborative musical engagement. They were easy to play and quick to learn and were used principally to accompany dance. They included battery-powered sound sources called UFOs that produce the Doppler effect as a sound source moves. These first appeared in a choreographic project by Yen Lu Wong entitled Between Silence and Light which culminated in a dance performance on the northern boardwalk of the Sydney Opera House accompanied by 4 UFOs, 4 handbells and 12 bamboo poles. The UFOs were precursors of more generic flying instruments, the Pocket Gamelan. * MIDI Tool Box (1984-1996) - a microcontroller system for interactive composition. It grew from live algorithmic compositions Monophonic Variations and Polyphonic Variations which he created as firmware written for the Datum microcomputer and realised in collaboration with electro- percussionist Graeme Leak. The MIDI Tool Box system was used in an interactive broadcast event and in concert performances with remnants of the Tupperware Gamelan as well as performance and installation work created by other composers. The hardware eventually incorporated the A4 audio signal processor developed at the CSIRO Division of Radiophysics and this was used in live concerts in 1995 with Carnatic violinist Krishna Kumar, and in 1996 with veena player Narayan Mani and Bharatnatyam-Kuchupudi choreographer Siri Rama. * Pocket Gamelan (2003-) - a set of microtonal instruments realised as software developed for mobile phones. Inspired by the legacy of Partch, represented in the work of contemporary tuning theorist and microtonal instrument builder Erv Wilson, the Pocket Gamelan was initially developed in the java language and recently migrated to iPhone. It has been used in live performances at international venues for computer music and microtonal music and in collaborations with musicians in Singapore at ISEA2008 and in Indonesia at GAUNG, a cultural workshop convened by the Sacred Bridge Foundation. Leading researchers have acknowledged the role the Pocket Gamelan has played in the development of performance with mobile devices.

Their factory, located in Villa Altagracia, Dominican Republic is the first and only verified Living Wage company of its kind. History The Alta Gracia factory opened in 2010 as a subsidiary of Knights Apparel. The company was founded with the promise to pays its employees a living wage, as established by the Workers Rights Consortium, for adequate food and shelter, which is about three and a half times the average income of apparel workers in the Dominican Republic. This Living Wage, which is established independently by the WRC (Worker's Rights Consortium) is set to provide a family of four the basic needs of housing, food, healthcare etc. The factory employs about 150 unionized people who, in 2013, made about $3 per hour, or $500 per month. This compares to the average wage in Bangladesh of $40 to $64 per month, according to a May 2013 survey reported by Reuters.Jackie Northam. \\"Can This Dominican Factory Pay Good Wages and Make a Profit?\\". NPR. June 30, 2013. Retrieved April 9, 2014. Alta Gracia is located in a former apparel sweatshop, that made baseball caps for Reebok and Nike until 2007. Its owner, BJ+B moved its clothing manufacture operations to Vietnam and Bangladesh where there were lower employment costs. Offering workers a fair wage came as the result of co-founders Donnie Hodge and Joe Bozich's response to student concerns regarding conditions under which collegiate apparel were produced. The Workers Rights Consortium along with student activist groups like the United Students Against Sweatshops, and James Wilkerson, Director of Trademark Licensing and Stores Operations at Duke University, were early leaders in the movement. In 2018, the company was acquired by AG Triada and moved headquarters to Atlanta, GA. Overview Alta Gracia makes collegiate and professional logo apparel, selling at over 700 collegiate bookstores as well as through online retailers such as Fanatics. They are the only Living Wage Verified apparel company.

While the town of G≈Çƒôbokie was captured by the Soviets, they failed at outflanking the Polish defenders. Because of that, the battle, being less decisive than the Soviets hoped for, was both a tactical victory and a strategic defeat for them. Because the Polish defenders did not realise that the town of G≈Çƒôbokie was the focal point of the entire Soviet operation, the battle was initially known in Polish historiography as battle on the Avuta (), after a small tributary of the Dysna River, where most of the fighting actually took place.  Prelude  The town of G≈Çƒôbokie itself (here, view from 1901), badly damaged during World War I, was of little strategic value to either side. In April and May the Polish successful Kiev Offensive reached Kiev and pushed the Red forces south of the Pripet Marshes behind the Dneper. However, Soviet forces evaded encirclement and retreated across the river. Quite unexpectedly to the Poles, on 14 May 1920 the forces of Mikhail Tukhachevsky's Western Front started a major counter-offensive in the northern sector of the front, aimed at G≈Çƒôbokie-≈öwiƒôciany area. The objective of the offensive was to outflank the Poles from the north, along the lines occupied by Lithuanian forces, and push them south-west. The Polish Commander-in-Chief General J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski redirected some forces from the rear and the southern sector of the front and ordered the First Polish Army under Gen. Stanis≈Çaw Szeptycki to immediately counter-attack on both flanks: from Polesia northwards and from the northernmost sector southwards. Despite Polish efforts, the Russian forces broke through towards Igumen and G≈Çƒôbokie. In two weeks Tukhachevsky created a 150 kilometres-deep bulge in Polish lines. To counter the threat, Pi≈Çsudski ordered yet another counter-offensive. The Polish plan demanded that the Soviet 15th Army be rapidly encircled by two pincers in front of G≈Çƒôbokie, while the rest of Soviet forces be pushed back behind Berezina. One pincer was formed by an Operational Group of Gen. Leonard Skierski formed of the bulk of the First and Fourth Armies. It was to attack the Soviets from the south, from Minsk towards Dokszyce and G≈Çƒôbokie. The other group was an ad hoc Reserve Army under Gen. Kazimierz Sosnkowski that was to drive through Pastavy and Duni≈Çowicze, and reach G≈Çƒôbokie as well. The counter-offensive started on 2 June 1920. The Russians offered stiff resistance at the line of 1915 Russian trenches from World War I. Despite heavy resistance, Sosnkowski's group broke through enemy right flank and forced Tukhachevsky to retreat behind the Avuta River. Although bad timing and poor coordination between both Operational Groups prevented the Poles from encircling the Soviets holding ground between G≈Çƒôbokie and Mo≈Çodeczno, Tukhachevsky nevertheless suffered a defeat. His 15th Army lost 12,000 soldiers while the Poles lost less than 4,000. Also, until June 10 the front was yet again stabilised and almost returned to the lines of early May. In late June, Tukhachevsky prepared a plan for a new offensive that was aimed at encircling the Polish 1st Army in the - - G≈Çƒôbokie triangle, thus creating a \\"little Sedan for the White Poles\\". The 15th Army (under August Kork) was to attack the Poles frontally, while the 3rd and 4th Armies were to start a pincer movement around the Polish forces.  Opposing forces  = Soviets = *4th Army **18th Rifle Division **12th Rifle Division **53rd Rifle Division **164th Brigade * 15th Army ** 11th Rifle Division ** 16th Rifle Division ** 33rd Rifle Division ** 54th Rifle Division = Poles = * 1st Army ** 5th Infantry Division (one Bde) ** 8th Infantry Division ** 11th Infantry Division ** 17th Infantry Division (in reserve) ** VII Reserve Brigade  Battle  = July 4 = The northernmost sector of the Polish front was attacked by the 4th Army under Sergeyev. The 18th Rifle Division was to attack the Poles to draw their reinforcements, while the remaining forces (12th and 53rd Rifle Divisions, as well as the 164th Rifle Brigade) was to break through a narrow () strip of land between Daugava River and Yelnya Lake. The bulk of the 4th Army was then to turn south towards Hermanowicze and Szarkowszczyzna, while the cavalry was to push further west, to outflank the Poles and disrupt their rear. To catch up with the enemy, the forces of the 4th Red Army were to cross between 22 and 40 versts (23.5 to 42.7 km) on the first day and between 18 and 24 versts (19.2 to 25.6 km) the second day. The attack, postponed until 8:00 hours due to the morning fog, was reinforced with 70 field guns and 8 pieces of heavy artillery. The Polish line in the area was lightly held by a token force of two battalions from the 33rd Infantry Regiment of the 8th Infantry Division, with one battalion in reserve, deep behind the line and 10 pieces of divisional artillery. By 9:00 the Reds captured the first lines. However, by then the element of surprise was gone. Despite numerical inferiority, the 33rd Regiment counter-attacked several times and the Russian advance stalled until 16:00 hours, when the two Polish battalions withdrew with their heavy equipment. It was not until 18:00 hours that the Russian 4th Army started its forced march towards the Polish rear. The diversionary attack by the 18th Rifle Division was even less successful. Despite heavy losses on both sides, the division was stopped by an infantry brigade from the 10th Infantry Division. The southernmost 3rd Army had equally ambitious aims: by the end of the first day it was to capture Dokszyce some behind Polish line, while on the second day it was to capture the entire Polotsk-Mo≈Çodeczno railway and cut all the retreat routes for the Polish 1st Army. The 3rd Army faced elements of the 11th Infantry Division and a single brigade from the 1st Lithuanian‚ÄìBelarusian Division. Despite huge numerical superiority, by the end of the day the Russians managed to establish isolated bridgeheads across Berezina some behind the Polish trenches, but most of the units covered at most. Both flanks thus failed to achieve their objectives and did not threaten the Polish rear. The Soviet centre was formed by the 15th Army with four rifle divisions spread across a front of . Polish line in this sector was manned by a single brigade of the 5th Infantry Division (the IX Infantry Brigade, 38th and 39th \\"Lw√≥w Rifles\\" Regiments), VII Reserve Brigade and the 11th Infantry Division holding the area north of the Polotsk- Mo≈Çodeczno railway. The entire 17th Infantry Division was held in reserve. During the first day of the offensive the Russian forces south of the railway successfully pushed the Poles back approximately , behind the Mniuta River near the town of Plisa. However, the bulk of the 15th Army fighting north of the railway was less successful. The Polish 10th and 17th Divisions successfully counter-attacked and by the end of the day the Russians gained not more than of land. This success came at a price: the brigade of the 5th Division and the VII Reserve Brigade suffered catastrophic losses and had to be withdrawn from the front. Furthermore, by that point the 1st Army had committed all of its assets and reserves to the fight except for the 8th Infantry Division in the far north. = July 5 = The following day the 4th Army resumed its march on the right flank of the Bolshevik forces, this time practically unopposed as the two battalions it had been facing the previous day withdrew westwards, away from the rest of the 8th Division. Only in the afternoon the remaining two battalions of the division were attacked by the front guard of the Russian force near the village of Pohost. In a series of skirmishes neither side gained an upper hand. However, because of those fights the 12th and 53rd Russian Rifle Divisions stopped their march westwards and faced south, giving the Polish units some badly-needed time to regroup and evade encirclement. Gen. Lucjan ≈ªeligowski withdrew his 10th Infantry Division behind Mniuta River to shorten the line, but the Russian force did not follow. In the centre the Russian offensive slowed down to a crawl. Despite the weakness of the Polish lines, the southernmost Russian divisions (11th and 33rd) pushed only a couple of kilometres forward, while the northern group (16th and 54th Rifle Divisions) did not even reach the new Polish line along the Mniuta River. However, Polish forces were equally exhausted. Despite orders to counter-attack and regain the initiative, the Polish centre remained mostly inactive, with only the Polish 10th Division fighting heavily against the Russian 54th along the Mniuta River in the village of ≈Åu≈ºki. The 3rd Army also slowed down and by noon did not enter into contact with the Polish forces, limiting the battle to sporadic artillery duels. To regain the initiative, around noon the 1st Army ordered a tactical withdrawal to break off from the enemy and mount a renewed counter-offensive. However, not all Polish units received the order simultaneously while the northernmost group under Gen. ≈ªeligowski did not receive it at all. Shortly before 14:00 Gen. RzƒÖdkowski's forces, including the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Division, started a forced march towards Mo≈Çodeczno. The central group under Gen. Jƒôdrzejowski (including 17th Division and the VII Reserve Brigade) was already performing a withdrawal westwards, towards Duni≈Çowicze, when the order reached his headquarters to change the direction and move south, to cover the flank of the Polish 4th Army. By that time Jƒôdrzejowski had already dispatched his supply trains and services westwards. The battered units under Jƒôdrzejowski's command thus started a march along the front of the entire Russian army, under constant artillery barrage, deprived of supplies and even field kitchens. The new orders also exposed the flank of Gen. ≈ªeligowski's forces, still successfully fighting in the north. Despite this obvious mistake, the Russians did not take advantage of the situation and their 4th and 15th Armies remained mostly stationary for the remainder of the day in that sector, which allowed Jƒôdrzejowski's force to reach the new line the next day. The Russian forces, still shaken from their previous defeats, often overestimated the Polish forces they were facing and followed orders reluctantly, which caused further disarray in their ranks. By the end of the day Gen. ≈ªeligowski's group became increasingly exposed to enemy action and enemy patrols started appearing behind his 10th Division, fighting in ≈Åu≈ºki on the Mniuta River. Both his divisions (8th and 10th) were also pressed from the front by the remainder of the 4th Army. Unable to establish contact with his southern neighbours, in the evening ≈ªeligowski also ordered a retreat towards Duni≈Çowicze, where he expected to find the forces of Gen. Jƒôdrzejowski. = July 6 = Overnight the 10th Division reached Mosarz, while the 8th reached Szarkowszczyzna. Unable to find friendly units there, he continued the withdrawal towards Duni≈Çowicze, a town he occupied by the end of the day. With no sign of either friendly or enemy forces, and no pressure from the east, ≈ªeligowski became convinced that his forces are already behind enemy lines and that the Russians are attacking towards south-west, in the direction of Mo≈Çodeczno. Although tempted to attack the centre of what he considered the rear of enemy front, the town of G≈Çƒôbokie which had been abandoned by Polish forces the previous day, eventually he ordered further withdrawal westwards. In reality, the town of G≈Çƒôbokie was free from enemy presence and no enemy units were following Gen. Jƒôdrzejowski's force. Only in the evening was the town captured by a weak Kuban Brigade and front guard of the badly-beaten 54th Rifle Division. Simultaneously the entire Russian force was regrouping for a renewed offensive against what Mikhail Tukhachevsky perceived as the main group of Polish forces due south. By noon of July 7 ≈ªeligowski reached the shores of Myadzel Lake. The pursuing forces, namely the 18th Rifle Division, did not reach that area until the evening of July 10.  Outcome  While the battle for G≈Çƒôbokie proved a tactical victory for the Russian side, it was a strategic defeat. The town was taken, but the basic aims of the entire operation were not met. The Polish 1st Army successfully withdrew and evaded three enemy armies trying to encircle it. Only a small Corps-sized Operational Group of Gen. Lucjan ≈ªeligowski (8th and 10th Infantry Divisions) did not receive the orders to withdraw and offered some resistance before finally breaking off and retreating westwards. The bulk of the 1st Army, namely the Operational Group of Gen. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jƒôdrzejewski, reached Mo≈Çodeczno without further contact with the enemy. In his post-war memoirs E.N. Sergeyev, the commanding officer of the 4th Army, recalled that Tukhachevsky was unaware that his plan failed and after the battle ordered the Poles to be surrounded in the area of Osinogr√≥dek and Kury≈Çowicze, some west of G≈Çƒôbokie, even though the 1st Army had already been withdrawn further west. Despite retaining cohesion, the 1st Army suffered serious losses in manpower and, more importantly, morale. It tried to form a new front line at the line of 1916 German and Russian trenches of World War I, running in front of Wilno (modern Vilnius, Lithuania). However, Hayk Bzhishkyan's Cavalry Corps joined the fight against the battle-weary 1st Army and achieved what the forces of Tukhachevski couldn't. The trench line had to be abandoned, and the 1st Army withdrew further west, to the Grodno-Neman River-Shchara River-Ogi≈Ñski Canal. The Cavalry Corps broke through that line as well in the aftermath of a three- day-long First Battle of Grodno of 20 July 1920. The 1st Army then set up a new defensive line along the Bug River, but its defence was equally unsuccessful. It was not until the victorious Battle of Warsaw of mid-August that the retreat stopped and the Polish forces regained initiative. By the end of October the Poles regained G≈Çƒôbokie and reached more or less the line they had lost in July.

The episode is written by series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss and directed, for the second time in this season, by David Nutter. It premiered on May 13, 2012. The name of the episode comes from Catelyn Stark's assessment of Ser Jaime Lannister: \\"You are a man without honor,\\" after he kills a member of his own family to attempt escape. Plot =In King's Landing= Sansa awakens from a nightmare to find she has had her first period, meaning she can bear Joffrey‚Äôs children. Shae tries to help conceal the blood, but discovers the Hound has seen the sheet. Cersei tells Sansa it will be impossible to love Joffrey, and to find comfort in their children instead. Tyrion tells Cersei his doubts about Joffrey's plan to repel Stannis' fleet. Cersei confesses her belief that Joffrey is punishment for her incest with Jaime. =Beyond the Wall= Jon searches for his companions, and captive Ygritte tells him life would be better with the wildlings. She teases his sexual inexperience, but he rebuffs her advances. Ygritte escapes, and Jon is unable to find her until she reveals he is surrounded by wildlings. =At Harrenhal= Tywin orders Ser Gregor \\"The Mountain\\" Clegane to find Lorch's killer, believing the murder was an attempt on his own life. Dining with Arya, Tywin deduces she is highborn and advises her to hide her status more carefully. =In the Westerlands= Robb hears Alton Lannister's unfavorable reply to the peace terms brought to Cersei and, with his prisons full, orders Alton placed with Jaime. Talisa agrees to accompany Robb to the Crag for medical supplies. Jaime kills Alton to draw the jailer, Torrhen Karstark, into the pen, strangling him before fleeing. Jaime is recaptured, and Lord Rickard Karstark demands his head for murdering his son, but Catelyn delays the execution until Robb's return. Confronting Jaime, Catelyn calls him \\"a man without honor\\", and Jaime bitterly explains the contradictions he faced in his vows as a knight. He provokes Catelyn, who asks for Brienne's sword. =In Qarth= Daenerys has difficulty trusting Xaro, who claims he did not take her dragons. Vowing to find them, Jorah confronts Quaithe, who tells him that the person who stole the dragons is with Daenerys. At a meeting of the Thirteen, Pyat Pree tells Daenerys that he has her dragons in the \\"House of the Undying\\". Xaro proclaims himself King of Qarth as Pree, having multiplied himself around the room, assassinates the remaining Thirteen, and Daenerys flees with Jorah and Kovarro. =At Winterfell= Realizing Osha has fled with Bran, Rickon, and Hodor, Theon beats Lorren for challenging him and hunts for the fugitives against Maester Luwin's wishes, following the trail of Bran and Rickon. They trace them to a farm, where Dagmer finds evidence that the Starks have been there. Returning from the hunt, Theon reveals the charred remains of two children as a public warning.

The band recorded several albums and singles under a number of record labels, including No-Hit Records, Bedrock Records, Wild Wild Records and Get Hip Records. Their final album, Shake Me! was released under Get Hip Records. Former members have been associated with The Bristols and Janey And The Ravemen since the disbanding of the group.  Imperial Wireless years =Formation and first recordings (1992-1995)= The Kaisers began playing early rock and roll classics and after developing their traditional sound further, they established themselves as a band in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1992. The band subsequently signed to the London label No Hit and began working with the music producer Liam Watson at Toe Rag Studios in Shoreditch, London, where they quickly released their first album, Squarehead Stomp!, in 1993. Not long after the promotion of their first record, they made several television appearances‚Äîincluding a spot on the NB Television Show in Scotland. In 1994, In Step With The Kaisers was released, plus an EP called Alligator Stomp!, which included tracks that were not featured on either of the previous albums. To promote the record they appeared on a BBC Radio Scotland program special reviewing The Beatles Biopic Backbeat film. It was on the radio show the Usual Suspects that Miller stated, \\"We're not The Beatles; we're not Gerry & The Pacemakers, we're The Kaisers.\\" The Kaisers also recorded two numbers for the program, \\"Soldier Of Love\\" and \\"Money (That's What I Want)\\", at the BBC Scotland studios. =Cracks emerge= By this point, problems had arisen and bassist John Gibbs had left. The band appointed Matt Curtis as bass player just in time for their appearance on Wire TV for an Edinburgh Festival TV special. A few months later The Kaisers were back in the studio with Watson recording Beat It Up! - arguably their best album and what people would consider to be The Kaisers at their apex. Beat It Up! gathered a storm in the underground market and led to The Kaisers' first US tour, their biggest achievement to date. The tour led to a show at the punk rock club CBGB's. Following another TV appearance for the Good Morning Breakfast Show in the UK and a few appearances around the country, the Kaisers suffered another departure, when Matt Armstrong left on sabbatical. Keith Warwick took his place before a trip to Alkmaar in 1995. Matt Curtis also left soon after in 1995 before getting replaced by Mark Ferrie. Get Hip years =Second US tour and demise of the Kaisers (1995-2002)= Following further personnel changes, only two original members remained‚ÄîGeorge Miller and Johnny Maben. Even though the band's most prolific years had passed, the pair soldiered on with a new album, Wishing Street, and a second US tour. The band's momentum had faltered and the members were involved in side projects. Furthermore, Maben's relocation to London made it inconvenient for the band to record and rehearse. The Kaisers seemed to be recovering when the band was interviewed on The Mark Radcliffe Studio on BBC Radio 2 in 1996. Five tracks were recorded live for the program and the band also appeared on the John Peel show that same year. During the early stage of the band's career, The Kaisers recorded three albums, two extended players (EPs) and two singles over three years. In the period following 1996 the band's work rate slowed down, and The Kaisers recorded two studio albums and a Christmas single over six years (these were not recorded at Toe Rag Studios or produced by Liam Watson, but were instead recorded at Chamber Studios in Edinburgh). By the time of the release of Shake Me!, the Kaisers final album, in 2002, the band was no longer functional. At the completion of the album, the members decided to disband. While an official announcement has not been made, the members of the band have not worked together since 2002.  Discography  *Squarehead Stomp! (1993) *In Step With The Kaisers (1994) *Beat It Up!

It was founded in 1992 in response to the thousands of children who were made orphans by the Afghanistan war and while orphans still remain a priority cause in the organization's work with more than 150,000 sponsored orphans, it has now expanded its fields of action to include six humanitarian fields (shelter, emergency medical response, food aid, WASH and financial aid) and seven development fields (health, education, WASH, food security, financial empowerment, housing and social care). Between 2012 and 2017, Qatar Charity has spent over US$1.3 Billion on humanitarian and development operations and projects which provided relief and assistance to more than 178 million people in over 50 countries. These projects are carried out either directly by Qatar Charity through its 24 subsidiary offices around the world or through partnerships with international or local NGOs or IGOs. In some of the world's most conflict-affected countries such as Yemen and Syria, Qatar Charity ranked among the top contributors (including governments) to humanitarian activities according to the OCHA-monitored Financial Tracking Service.  Management  , Qatar Charity is headed by its president, Hamad bin Nasser al-Thani, and its CEO, Yousef bin Ahmed al-Kuwari.  Major projects  Among QC's major long- term projects are \\"Tayf,\\" a charity program to collect in-kind donations, and the annual \\"Iftar\\" project for the month of Ramadan, which aims to provide meals to thousands of fasting Muslims in targeted countries. In July 2015, Vodafone Qatar and Qatar Charity created a partnership. Employees of Vodafone helped feed workers at camps in the Ras Laffan Industrial City with Iftar meals during Ramadan. Vodafone promised to donate $275 per hour that each employee volunteers. The donations will go to Qatar Charity's Family Sponsorship program. The program helps low-income families throughout the Gulf area. Recently, Qatar Charity has also launched a website (\\"Travel and Aid\\") to attract participation in charitable work. Qatar Charity is at the forefront of relief work in the face of major natural disasters. This was the case in Nepal, where Qatar Charity distributed $100.000 in food, blankets, mattresses and other non-food items including hygiene kits. In Sierra Leone, the charity supported the purchase of vital equipment at an Ebola Treatment Center (ETC) in Lunsar. It also played a part in the 2008‚Äì2009 Gaza Strip aid delivering around $140,000 worth of medical supplies. In other international efforts, it had raised around QAR 2 million as relief for the 2010 Pakistan floods. In Niger, Qatar Charity is supporting local efforts to combat drought and improve the overall desperate conditions in the villages of Sowna and Aichign by funding the installation of modern solar-powered artesian wells. In southern Mali, it opened shelters for displaced children. During 2014, Qatar Charity's long-standing commitment to the people of Somalia was renewed as the charity provided QAR 25.5 million ($7 million) in life-saving relief, recovery and rehabilitation programs and activities. QC launched a project to construct the village of 'Doha Alkhair' in Djibouti at an estimated cost of QAR 4 million in September 2015. One-hundred houses, basic amenities and public utilities were among the planned infrastructure. QC recently sent relief convoys to refugees in South Sudan, and it is currently funding programs in support of Syrian refugees in Lebanon. As of October 2015, the organization has carried out four housing projects in Syria, during which it has repaired and built new villages. The most notable housing project is Al Rayyan, an under-construction village designed to accommodate 7,000 people. QC has also deployed around 400 pre-fabricated housing units in Syria.

The Nectar Trust is the British subsidiary of the Qatar Charity, from which it received more than ¬£28 million in 2016/17. Saleh Mohammed Fahad Gharrab Al-Marri, born in January 1952, is a Qatari national and director and trustee of the Nectar Trust since February 2018. Al-Marri is also the adviser of the executive chairman of the Qatar Charity main organisation. The Emaan Trust of Sheffield lists Aiman Mohammed Ebrahim Saeed as a person with significant control. Saeed was given a suspended 18-month jail sentence and ordered to pay ¬£300 compensation each to seven victims whose stolen phones were found in his possession. The Nectar Trust has also donated over ¬£1.5 million over 2015/16 to the Human Relief Foundation, which was banned by Israel due to its support for Hamas. The Nectar Trust continues to support Muslim Brotherhood groups in Europe, notably UCOII (Italy's main Islamic association) and Fonds de Dotation Passerelles (Passerelles Endowment Fund), a regional French Islamic organisation. British media revealed that the Qatari official who ran the British arm of Qatar Charity also founded an anti-Semitic website. It is worth noting that Qatar Charity has always been cleared from any accusations of support to terrorism by the United Nations https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/06/bound-saudi-arabia-terror- list-170609184543168.html According to Foreign Policy, Osama Bin Laden named the organization ‚Äúone of several charities that were used to fund al Qaeda‚Äôs overseas operations‚Äù. On February 11, 2015, Sudan Tribune reported controversial statements by Yahia Sadam, an official of the Minni Minnawi Sudanese liberation movement who accused Qatar of endorsing the genocide perpetrated by Sudanese militiamen in Darfur by funneling money though the Sudanese branch of Qatar Charity, active in Darfur since 2010. Sadam claimed that Qatar Charity, which had purportedly signed a cooperation agreement with the Sudanese troops, was \\"building housing complexes in remote and isolated areas to harbor and train extremist groups.\\" Those camps are believed to be hosting ISIS fighters, a concern voiced by attendees from the intelligence community at a March 2015 event at the United States Institute for Peace. Cables leaked through WikiLeaks show that Qatar Charity was an organization of concern to the U.S. Government for ‚Äúits suspect activities abroad and reported links with extremists‚Äù and its ‚Äúintent and willingness to provide financial support to terrorist organizations willing to attack US persons or interests.‚Äù These cables were created in 2009, years before Al-Kuwari became CEO of Qatar Charity but controversies surrounding Qatar Charity have persisted under Al- Kuwari's leadership. While Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and other countries in the region designated Qatar Charity as a terrorist organization along with a dozen organizations in the aftermath of the blockade imposed on Qatar in June 2017, the United Nations continues to work with Qatar Charity. It is worth noting that Qatar Charity had won numerous Saudi Arabian awards just months before the feud, among which the 1st prize at the Arab Gulf Programme for Development (AGFUND) for its project in Sudan: 'Promoting Voluntary Return and Peace Building in Darfur' In 2013, while Al-Kuwari was CEO of Qatar Charity, a Washington Institute for Near East Policy report emerged that Qatar Charity assistance had made its way to the Syrian Islamic Front, an umbrella group of powerful jihadist organizations operating in the Syrian Civil War. The Qatar Charity logo reportedly appeared in the video showing Syrian Islamic Front affiliates distributing the Qatar Charity-labelled aid. In 2013, Iranian news agency FARS reported that Qatar had wired $5 billion to Syrian rebel groups through Qatar Charity. In May 2016, Hamad bin Nasser al-Thani, a member of the Qatari royal family, and Yusuf Ahmed Al-Kuwari traveled to Italy, where Qatar Charity reportedly donated 25 million euros over three years for the construction of mosques and Islamic centers. These donations led to questions over how religious instruction will be implemented in the religious centers.

It is renowned for its beauty and diversity, cited by Backpacker magazine as one of the top 25 hiking trails in the United States. The trail offers scenic views, waterfalls, rock formations, and hemlock trees over 200 years old. The trail follows Fiery Gizzard Creek for a time, then ascends to Raven Point which offers a \\"spectacular overlook.\\" From there, the trail runs along the canyon rim to Foster Falls. The trail is part of the South Cumberland State Park. History Various legends explain how the Fiery Gizzard creek, and thereby the trail alongside it, might have gotten its name. One suggests that, while eating a turkey at his camp along the creek, Davy Crockett burned his tongue on a gizzard and spit it into the gorge. Another holds that an Indian chief threw a turkey gizzard into the fire to get the attention of Europeans at a peace conference. A historical marker near the Tracy City terminus recalls a \\"crude experimental blast furnace\\" built by Tennessee Coal and Railroad Company in the 1870s to determine if the coal could produce iron. The furnace, called \\"Fiery Gizzard,\\" burned for three days, producing \\"only\\" , then the stovepipe collapsed. In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) company 1475 established camp near Tracy City where they dug several lakes and worked to prevent forest fires in the surrounding area. The CCC made improvements to the Fiery Gizzard Trail by building steps near the Fruit Bowl rock feature. They also built a pump house above the Blue Hole. The trail, maintained as part of the South Cumberland Recreation Area by the State of Tennessee, goes through the Grundy Forest State Natural Area and through the Foster Falls Wild Area owned by TVA, but half crosses private property, and a large portion of the views from the trail were, in 2010, owned by a timber investment company. The state and a coalition of conservation groups have purchased land to secure the vistas for the future.  Terrain  Diverse rocky formations such as this rock shelter draw hikers to the trail. The Tracy City end of the Fiery Gizzard Trail is accessed via the relatively flat Grundy Forest Day Loop. The loop begins at the Grundy Forest State Natural Area Picnic Shelter, and after just presents hikers with a waterfall. Vestiges of the Civilian Conservation Corps camp S-67 can be seen another half mile down the walk. Hikers can see the confluence of Little and Big Fiery Gizzard Creeks, can cool off in three swimming holes, two with waterfalls. The Fiery Gizzard trail begins roughly midway along the Day Loop, crossing a bridge across Little Fiery Gizzard Creek while the loop continues without crossing the bridge. Sights along the trail begin with a large rock shelter and a five-century-old Hemlock tree, the deep Blue Hole with waterfall, then Sycamore Falls, a \\"superb swimming hole\\" at the base of a fall. The trail then passes through the \\"Fruit Bowl,\\" a pile of house-sized boulders with CCC-built stairs through them. Other features in this portion of the hike include Chimney Rock, a rock column, Black Canyon - so named because of organic stain on the rocks, and Crumbling Bluff - an area \\"honeycombed with pits and small caves.\\" After , the trail begins an arduous climb to Raven Point, \\"possibly one of the most rugged and difficult trails in Tennessee.\\" Raven Point offers a \\"spectacular overlook\\" on a spur off the main trail. Continuing from there, the path mostly follows the flatter top of the Cumberland Plateau, except for a precarious horizontal vertical (each way) dip into Laurel Branch Gorge across myriad rocks that \\"all seem to move as you step on them.\\" There are four camping areas along the hike. A camping permit is required. Visitors are encouraged to leave the place as they found it.  Flora and fauna  The Fiery Gizzard Trail offers hikers views of 636 types of vascular plants including mountain laurel, hemlock trees, beefsteak fungus, violets, Solomon's seals, Hepatica, trillium, dwarf crested iris, reindeer moss, and galax. Myriad animals can also be found along the hike including bumblebees, hummingbirds, rattlesnakes, green snakes, red salamanders, crayfish. The snakes are not a special cause for concern as they are not particularly aggressive. One might even find oneself swimming with a mink at one of the many swimming holes.  Property Access  As of August, 2015, South Cumberland State Park has announced that the trail as it currently exists may have to close. Jim Southard Jr., a private property owner that currently grants access to hikers, intends to sell property in the area and believes that the hikers affect the value of his property. He will no longer grant access to his property on December 1, 2015. He has offered to sell his portion of the trail to the State, and the Friends of South Cumberland are attempting to raise $2 million for the preservation of the current trail. In 2016, a second property owner, Hugh P. Liebert, asked the trail to be removed from his property as well.

It has twelve floors and is high. The ground floor of the building is occupied by Worthington National Bank. The Burk Burnett Building has been listed on National Register of Historic Places since November 12, 1980. History The Burk Burnett Building was designed by Sanguinet & Staats and built in 1914. At the time of construction, it was the tallest building of the city and became the first skyscraper in Fort Worth. It was originally occupied by the State National Bank. The bank was declared bankrupt in 1915, and the building was bought by Samuel Burk Burnett and renamed. The building underwent renovations in 1980 and 1984. In particular, in 1984 the old bank lobby was restored. In 2005, the Worthington National Bank restored the lobby, hiring for this an artist, Xiang Xian. Architecture The Burk Burnett Building was the last of three buildings constructed by Sanguinet & Staats and similar in design. The first two were the ALICO Building in Waco (1911) and the Rand Building in San Antonio (1913). It is built in a neoclassical style. The lower part of the building (two floors) is made of white terracotta and of granite columns, the middle part (eight floors) is of red brick with terracotta layers separating floors, and the top part (two floors) is decorated white terracotta. In 1919, the building in Fort Worth currently known as Hilton Fort Worth Hotel was specifically constructed by Sanguinet & Staats to resemble the Burk Burnett Building.

The structure is the most significant example of the Streamline Moderne style in Santa Rosa, and was the tallest building in the city for many years. History The store was planned to replace a 1907 store owned by Max and Fred Rosenberg that burned in 1936. The design for the new store was carried out by Hertzka and Knowles of San Francisco in 1936, and construction by contractors Moore and Roberts started on January 19, 1937. The store opened on October 27, 1937, along with the Purity grocery store in a one-story section. A model of the building was shown as \\"an exemplar of future architectural technology\\" at the 1939 San Francisco World's Fair. In 1951 Joseph Edward McNeany purchased Rosenberg's for $1.5 million. The store was substantially renovated and expanded in 1964. After modernizing the three- story store it was merged in 1966 with Aldens Inc., a Chicago-based mail order and retail sales subsidiary of Gambel-Skogmo. Under terms of the agreement, McNeany stayed on as a consultant and his son, William, became vice president and general manager of Rosenberg's. It closed in 1988 and was vacant until 1994. That year, the Art Deco Society of California recognized the structure with its Preservation Award in 1988 to encourage the building's owners to save the structure. The city government approved demolition of the store in 1994, but it was subsequently saved when bookstore chain Barnes & Noble leased the space. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 29, 1994. Description Rosenberg's is a two-story structure measuring about by , with an attached by one-story section. The front is dominated by an Art Moderne style marquee and sign that extends beyond the roof, with the main entrance under the marquee. The steel-framed structure is clad with stucco-covered cast in place concrete. The lower level features continuous plate glass display windows, with a curved corner above set apart by string courses or \\"speed lines\\", inset with glass block clerestory windows. Large punched openings with keystone-like vertical stripes define the second floor bays. The marquee section is defined by flanking pylons embracing a tall, glass block window whose surface undulates. A fin or \\"blade sign\\" rises from the top of the window to about above the roof, where it originally carried neon lettering advertising the store. A taller fin is set back and rises much higher, to above the roof. It is translucent, and was internally lighted with green neon. The one-story section is much plainer, with a continuous canopy across the front. The entrance to this section is marked by two arches in the canopy. The interior has a high-ceilinged section overlooked by a mezzanine. Interior columns have capitals resembling Egyptian prototypes. The mezzanine and stair railings are slender horizontal bars with birch handrails.

Already established and recognized for centuries and highly esteemed within the Holy Roman Empire, Mathias Franz together with his equally eminent brothers were each venerated for their own exceptional services to the Bohemian Crown and elevated as the first Counts of Chorinsky on 12 December 1761 by Empress of the Holy Roman Empire and Archduchess Maria Theresa in her sovereignty as Queen regnant of Bohemia. On 3 April 1798 the House of Chorinsky-Ledske were named chief banner-bearers (German Oberst-Erblandpanier- Tr√§ger) of the peerage of Bohemia. = Career = Mathias Franz studied in Olm√ºtz (Olomouc); on 5 April 1743 he was ordained a Roman Catholic priest; later that year he became Canon of the collegiate chapter of St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Br√ºnn (Brno) and in 1752 the Dean.The Diocese of Brno, official website, in Czech.

The coat of arms is often found with a mantel surrounding; a purple cloak with ermine lining, tasselled and fringed with gold (Or) string, and shield supporters being two human male figures. Some variations of the coat of arms are also seen with the addition of the bison horns represented again surmounted above a two-pearled leafed crown resting on a front facing barred Knight‚Äôs helmet with jewelled necklace (a similar blazon as found on the original coat of arms borne prior to addition of the count-coronet ranking post-1761).  Miscellaneous  As name spellings were historically fairly fluid, especially given the different languages used in the region, the main name of \\"Chorinsky\\" is also sometimes found in documents as Chorynski, Chorensky, Chorenski, Chorynsky and Chorinska (the last being a female form), and \\"Ledske\\" is found as Ledska, Ledetz and Letske.

Veseli Castle Veseli castle is located at Veseli nad Moravou. Photos The castle was once part of the count's family estates. It is a private restoration project supervised by the Czech Heritage Institute. Once a former moated 13th century castle, the castle and its estate were inherited in 1731 by Mathias Franz' father, Franz Karl Baron of Chorinsky and Ledske. It was later occupied by descendants of Mathias Franz' brother Franz Johann until April 1945. The estate was then confiscated by the state of Czechoslovakia, and this branch of the family fled to Austria.

Plot  After a successful heist, Franck Adrien and his partner are convicted and sent to prison. Adrien is the only one who knows the location of the stash, and he refuses to tell both his wife and his partner. However, despite his initially aloof relationship with Jean-Louis Maurel, Adrien comes to trust his cellmate and saves him from a savage beating by Russian mobsters. When Adrien's former partner puts him in the prison hospital, Maurel visits Adrien. Although Adrien does not trust Maurel enough to reveal the location of his stash, Adrien gives Maurel a hint to pass along to Anna, Adrien's wife, as Maurel is being released early due to his alleged victim recanting her charges of rape. Adrien's peace of mind is ruined when Manuel Carrega, a member of the National Gendarmerie, visits him and requests information on Maurel, whom he insists is a serial killer and rapist. When the Russian mobsters ambush Adrien in retaliation for his earlier intervention, Adrien overpowers both them and a corrupt guard, and he escapes from the prison by using the guard's uniform. While Adrien attempts to check on his family, he encounters Claire Linn√©, a rising star who has been reassigned to capture him. Gambling that she will not shoot an unarmed man, Adrien flees her custody and attempts to locate his family. Unable to find them, he checks his stash, where he finds his wife's corpse hidden. Using a cell phone, Adrien briefly makes contact with Maurel, who assures him that his daughter Am√©lie is safe ‚Äì but only so long as Adrien stays away, as Christine, Maurel's wife, desires a child. Desperate, Adrien sneaks into Carrega's house and forces him at gunpoint to help him track down Maurel. Carrega reveals that he was dismissed from the Gendarmerie due to his obsession with Maurel, but, using his remaining contacts, he is able to find Maurel's last location. Meanwhile, Linn√© has come under increasing pressure to recapture Adrien now that Maurel has framed him. She hesitates once again when she finds Adrien at Carrega's house, and she is demoted to desk duty. Adrien does not escape unscathed, and he is shot in the side when Carrega returns to rescue him. Carrega is critically injured when he breaks a police barricade, and he urges Adrien to abandon him. Adrien tracks Maurel on foot, and Linn√© researches Adrien, Carrega, and Maurel, whom she comes to believe is responsible for a recent rape. Her superior mocks her \\"feminine intuition\\" and refuses to investigate Maurel, so Linn√© confronts him alone. Adrien and Linn√© converge on Maurel's house at the same time, and Linn√© chooses to trust Adrien over Maurel during a standoff. Maurel wounds Linn√© and chases after Adrien, who has escaped with Am√©lie. Before Maurel can finish off Adrien, Linn√© kills Maurel. However, the father of one of Maurel's victims shoots Adrien in the mistaken belief that Adrien is the rapist. Adrien falls off a cliff and disappears. In the epilogue, Am√©lie receives a letter that is implied to be from her father.

It was founded in 1905 by the Mississippi Conference of the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church. After desegregation of community colleges in the mid-20th century, it had trouble competing and eventually closed in 1982. The campus was listed as a historic site on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 and was acquired by Rust College in 2008. History Intended to train students for agriculture and trades, the school was located on a campus. The Mississippi Conference of the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church founded it in 1905. In January 1906 the first academic session began. Two hundred students were enrolled by May 1906. By 1908 the school had 450 students. By 1912 the college was running an extension program to allow students who didn't have time to attend its regular programs to benefit from the education it provided. According to the Times-Picayune, then president D. C. Potts told a meeting of the Mississippi Colored Methodist Conference in reference to this that \\"an institution [MIC] for which the people were sacrificing ought to be able to help more than the few students who attended its session.\\" After the desegregation of Mississippi community colleges, many students chose to go to other schools. In addition, student expectations were changing. In 1982 the campus closed. In November 1999 the Mississippi Industrial College Alumni Association, Inc. (MICAAI) was organized in order to preserve the campus and buildings, which had been listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

Biography Galuccio was born in Paran√°, Entre R√≠os Province, in 1968. He enrolled at the Institute of Technology of Buenos Aires (ITBA) and graduated with a degree in petroleum engineering in 1994. He joined YPF shortly after graduation, and worked in the Dallas-based Maxus subsidiary following its 1995 acquisition by YPF. He was designated head of operations and development in the firm's Patagonian oil fields division in 1996, and of YPF's oil fields Indonesia in 1998. Galuccio resigned his post following the 1999 acquisition of YPF by Madrid-based Repsol. He joined Houston-based oilfield services firm Schlumberger, and was designated general manager of the firm's operations in Mexico and Central America. This division grew under Galuccio, with whom the Mexican state oil firm Pemex signed numerous oil services contracts. He was named director of the Schlumberger Integrated Project Management (IPM) division in 2005, and in 2011 became the director of Schlumberger Production Management; based in London, the latter was a division created by Galuccio for the oilfield services leader. Governor Sergio Urribarri of Entre R√≠os Province recommended Galuccio to President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner on March 4 as an energy policy adviser; Galuccio's brother, Carlos, had served as director of the Entre R√≠os Industrial Union (the local chapter of the Argentine Industrial Union manufacturers' association). The president interviewed Galuccio on April 4, and following her introduction of a bill in Congress on April 16 to renationalize 51% of YPF, the Schlumberger executive resigned his post.

This approach includes an emphasis on epigenetic causes of adult chronic diseases, including the potential for such environmental causes to influence disease risk across generations. Origin The DOHaD approach originated in studies by David Barker and his colleagues, which showed a strong relationship between infant mortality rates from 1921 to 1925 and ischemic heart disease rates from 1968 to 1978. This led to the fetal origins hypothesis of the origins of adult diseases, which proposed that this relationship was caused by differences in early life nutrition. This in turn led to greater interest in the roles of developmental plasticity and early life environmental exposures in adult disease. The World Congress on Fetal Origins of Adult Disease held two meetings ‚Äì one in 2001 and the other in 2003 ‚Äì summarizing then-new research in these areas. This congress later evolved into the International Society for Developmental Origins of Health and Disease.

It began after the death of Thomas Brooks on August 24, 1896. The Brooks family blamed the McFarlands and from there followed a series of confrontations that culminated in a historic shootout at Spokogee on September 22, 1902. During the shootout, Willis Brooks and two others were killed while a fourth man was seriously wounded. The feud ended about three weeks later, on October 10, 1902, when Jim McFarland was ambushed and killed near his home. According to the author Edward Herring: \\"The deaths of Willis Brooks and Jim McFarland signaled the end of an era when disputes were settled with gun smoke and hot lead. With them also died the old feud.\\" Background ;Brooks Faction In April 1884, Sheriff Alex Heflin decided he had had enough of the Brooks family and he deputized some local men and attempted to make arrests. A gunfight occurred on April 14. Gaines and a citizen named Phillips of the Sheriff's party were killed while Henry and two more deputies were wounded. Henry was hit in one of his legs and after it was amputated he became known as \\"Peg Leg\\" Brooks. The Brooks family then went West. For the next six years they lived in Cooke County, Texas, but, in 1890, Willis II, who was now the leader of the family, moved north to the Chickasaw Nation, in the Indian Territory. He didn't stay for long though; in 1894 he moved his family again. This time to a new settlement known as Dogtown, twenty-five miles west of Eufaula, in the Creek Nation. ;McFarland Faction The McFarland family was smaller than the Brooks, but had an equally questionable history prior to the beginning of the feud in 1896. Jim McFarland was the leader. According to Edward Herring, the Riddles joined the McFarlands because Willis Brooks attempted to have the former \\"driven out of the area,\\" sometime before 1896. The feud The feud began with the death of Thomas Brooks on April 24, 1896. The Brooks family blamed the McFarlands. Willis claimed that Jim enticed his son into committing the crime. From there the situation slowly escalated, both sides vowed to shoot each other on sight. Since both factions weren't above cattle and horse theft, and the Dogtown area was known for being infested with rustlers, it is likely that at least one of the families was involved in stealing livestock from the other. According to Ken Butler, one of Henry's family members lived nearby and delivered him \\"syrup\\" and other food while he was imprisoned. The \\"syrup\\" was actually a certain type of acid that could dissolve metal. Henry applied the acid to the metal bars in his jail cell whenever he could and he hollowed out his peg leg to hide the bottle. ;The railroad and the founding of Spokogee George Sparks, a Fort Smith banker, and Cliff Speer, the owner of a hardware store in Fort Smith, controlled town site privileges along the new railroad, but because it was to pass through Creek territory they were unable to capitalize on their concession. Instead they contracted two Oklahoma attorneys, S. Morton Rutherford, and his young partner, Jesse Hill, to handle it for them. When the fight started, Brooks began hitting Riddle with brass knuckles and knocked him to the ground, so Tyson intervened again to take the weapon away. However, before the fight resumed, John's uncle, Sam Baker, armed himself with his rifle and pointed it at Riddle. Hill, who was standing nearby, pushed Baker's rifle barrel toward the ground and said: \\"Don't act a fool.\\" Baker then released his hold on the rifle, drew his revolver, and pointed it at Hill's face. Rutherford then armed himself and pointed his weapon at Sam while the latter's sixteen-year-old son, Bill, grabbed his rifle and pointed at Rutherford. The situation was very tense for a moment, but the \\"cool headed\\" Cliff Speer managed to diffuse it by slowly lowering Rutherford's rifle barrel and allowing Sam a chance to leave. When Sam was out of firing range, Bill lowered his weapon as well and they both left to tell Willis. Jesse Hill said the following about that day: \\"It was the first and only time I ever looked down a gun barrel.... Willis Brooks and his cohorts, each mounted and armed, rode up to do battle.... Unless something was done to stay the upcoming disaster, potential buyers would not become lot-owners. To my surprise, Rutherford entered the scene. Rutherford addressed the leader of each side in turn, at times bombastically belligerent, at times profanely pacific, but at all times profusely perspiring. He talked the two sides out of battle, but all of this had a bad effect on the crowd.\\" In spite of the interruption, Rutherford and Hill managed to make $14,000, and more over the next few days. After the sale, the new land owners began building houses and businesses, but the town \\"refused to boom\\" because of the feud. Although Spokogee quickly grew to support a population of 150 people, Hill described them as nervous, especially when the McFarland or the Brooks families rode in heavily armed. Hill eventually left town because of the stress, some of which was brought about by George Riddle, who had a bad habit of pulling his gun on anyone over any kind of altercation. ;Gunfight at Spokogee According to Edward Herring, after the July 1 incident, the McFarland faction was ready to kill the Brooks' whenever the opportunity presented itself. The opportunity came on September 22, 1902, after a thunderstorm passed over the area. At the Brooks Ranch the rain scattered some of the cattle and it prevented the men from working the farm. Because of this, Henry \\"Peg Leg\\" Brooks and his nephew, Earl, went out to roundup the livestock while Willis and two of his other sons, Clifton and John, mounted up to ride into town for the mail. Meanwhile, the McFarlands and the Riddles had anticipated their arrival, due to the rain. They came up with a plan to ambush the Brooks' in town, but in a way that made it appear as though it was self-defense. The McFarlands took up positions across the street from the post office and then sent George Riddle out to \\"take care of some errands.\\" However, Riddle's real intention was to confront the Brooks' and provoke a fight. When Willis and his sons rode into town later that morning, they dismounted and tied their horses up in front of the post office. Then, as the three were entering the building, Riddle came out of the door with his mail. The Brooks' immediately began making threats and Riddle said something to this effect: \\"Kill me if you want, I am unarmed and have but one time to die.\\" Herring says that the plan worked perfectly, Willis and his sons cursed Riddle and then drew their weapons on him, but he hastily ran across the street to Rutherford, who was standing in front of his office, and requested protection. According to Ken Butler, Rutherford, who was a United States Marshal, among his other professions, called out to Willis and demanded peace. But before Rutherford could finish his sentence, Willis fired a shot at Riddle with his revolver. The bullet struck Riddle in the head and he fell to Rutherford's feet. George Herring, however, says that Jesse Hill was standing inside Rutherford's office and witnessed Sam McFarland fire the first shots. Though Herring does say that Sam's firing was wild and only intended to taunt the Brooks'. Herring says that Sam's firing scared Riddle and it was at this time that he turned around and fled to Rutherford. No matter which version is true, after hitting George Riddle in the head, Willis \\"wasted precious time\\" by running up to him and shooting him twice more. Someone, possibly Rutherford, then fired on Willis and struck him in his right hip. Willis jumped up into the air and then fell face down into the mud. He got back up a moment later and began firing, but was then hit in the chest and killed. Clifton Brooks was struck multiple times; once in the leg, once in the neck, and once more in the chest, but he was able to survive the initial volley and make a run for it. Alonzo Riddle and Jim McFarland then chased him down on horseback and killed him. John Brooks was shot \\"through and through\\" and found lying near the back door of the post office, having been struck by a steel-jacketed bullet. Immediately after the shooting ceased, Rutherford arrested Jim, Joe, and Alonzo and then delivered them to Deputy Marshal Grant Johnson in Eufaula by wagon. The three men were placed in the Eufaula Jail and went before the county commissioner's court two days later on September 24. All three were charged with murder and released on bonds to await trial. John Brooks was also charged with murder, but he remained in Spokogee because of his critical condition. The town doctor expected John to die of blood poisoning, but he survived and lived into the 1950s. Willis and Clifton were buried in Checotah next to Thomas Brooks, who died in 1896. ;Death of Jim McFarland Less than three weeks after the gunfight at Spokogee, Jim McFarland was killed in an ambush. On October 10, 1902, Jim and his wife were returning home from Weleetka in their buggy, and as they approached a river ford near Old Watsonville, someone opened fire on them with a rifle. One steel-jacketed bullet struck Jim in the back and he died a few minutes later. According to Ken Butler, the first newspaper account of the incident says that Henry \\"Peg Leg\\" Brooks killed Jim near Weleetka, although this was later proven to be false. Henry and Sam Baker were the prime suspects, but there was no evidence and neither of them were arrested. Some local citizens believed that McFarland was killed by a member of his own faction, but in any event, nobody was ever charged for the crime. According to Edward Herring: \\"Most believed he had gotten what he deserved.\\" Aftermath The death of Jim McFarland marked the end of the feud, although some newspaper accounts say that Henry Brooks was killed shortly after. Henry, however, lived until 1920. In 1905, Henry was arrested for stealing horses again and sentenced to ten years in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. When he was paroled on January 10, 1911, Henry went home to Lawrence County, Alabama, where he took care of his aging mother and became a bootlegger. On January 11, 1920, Henry was surrounded at his still by a posse under the command of Sheriff John Robinson. Though he was completely outnumbered, Henry chose to resist and began firing his revolver. The posse then retaliated and struck Henry twelve times. He died about fifteen minutes later. Sam Baker also died violently. In 1911, Sam became involved in a dispute with a Checotah merchant, who shot him in the back one day. Old \\"Jenny\\" Brooks outlived all of her sons. She died on March 29, 1924, at the age of ninety-eight, and is said to have been proud that all of her sons had \\"died like men, with their boots on.\\" As for the McFarland faction; all of those arrested were later acquitted and they continued living in the area. The Fort Smith and Western Railway tracks finally reached Spokogee on April 1, 1903 and soon after the town was renamed Dustin.

He is an emeritus professor of the Australian National University currently affiliated to the Regulatory Institutions Network (RegNet), College of Asia and the Pacific, ANU. He was the founding director of the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research (CAEPR) at the Australian National University (1990 to 2010) and then a research professor there until 2014 when he retired. He is a Fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia and an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand. From 2008 to 2013 he was an Australian Research Council Australian Professorial Fellow. In late 2015 Altman moved to Melbourne to take up an appointment from 1 February 2016 as research professor at the Alfred Deakin Institute for Citizenship and Globalization at Deakin University. Early life Altman was born in Haifa, Israel and attended school in New Zealand. In 1973 he completed a BA in Economics and Philosophy at the University of Auckland and went on to complete a MA (Hons) in Economics. Altman relocated to Australia in 1976. Career In his early career Altman sought to examine Indigenous disadvantage from an economic rather than the then dominant social welfare perspective and to place Indigenous economic development issues in a comparative international context.Altman, J.C. and Nieuwenhuysen, J.P. 1979. The Economic Status of Australian Aborigines, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, pp. xix & 230 (republished in 2006 as a Cambridge paperback). Between 1978 and 1982 Altman completed a PhD in Anthropology at the Australian National University. He used ethnographic methods and comparative analysis from the field of economic anthropology to examine Aboriginal ways of living at remote outstations on Aboriginal-owned land. He undertook fieldwork amongst the Kuninjku people in Western Arnhem Land.Altman, J.C. 1987. Hunter-Gatherers Today: An Aboriginal Economy in North Australia, Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, Canberra, pp. xvi & 251. Throughout the 1980s he undertook a series of research projects about Indigenous engagement with new industries including mining,Altman, J.C. 1983. Aborigines and Mining Royalties in the Northern Territory, Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, Canberra, pp. xvii & 164. tourism,Altman, J.C. 1988.

The Aboriginal Arts and Craft Industry, Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra, pp. xviii & 376. He collaborated with Chris Gregory, an anthropologist at the Australian National University, to theorise and document this methodology.Gregory, C.A. and Altman, J.C. 1989. Observing the Economy, ASA Research Methods in Social Anthropology 3, Routledge, London, pp. x & 252. In 1990, Altman established the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research (CAEPR) at the Australian National University as a multidisciplinary centre to enhance Australia‚Äôs capacity to undertake social sciences research about the economic situation of Indigenous people. He was director of the Centre from 1990 to 2010. Since 2001, he has focused his research on the hybrid economy framework and theory that encompasses the intercultural nature of Aboriginal livelihood approaches particularly in remote regions, the articulations between customary, market and state sectors of remote Aboriginal economies. (Page information missing) Since 2006, Altman shifted his intellectual focus to political ecology and critical development studies. He has been an outspoken critic of policies of the Australian government in Indigenous affairs, labelling them \\"neoliberal assimilation\\" and \\"neo paternalist\\". Since the 2007 Northern Territory National Emergency Response, he has co-edited two books with his partner, anthropologist Melinda Hinkson, criticising the intervention.Altman, J.C. and Hinkson, M.

The parent compound of PSTs, saxitoxin (STX), is a tricyclic perhydropurine alkaloid, which can be substituted at various positions, leading to more than 30 naturally occurring STX analogues. All of them are related imidazoline guanidinium derivatives. Sources NSTX, and other PSTs, are produced by several species of marine dinoflagellates (eukaryotes) and freshwater cyanobacteria, blue-green algae (prokaryotes), which can form extensive blooms around the world. Under special conditions, during harmful algal blooms (HAB) or red tide, all these toxins may build up in filter- feeding shellfish, such as mussels, clams and oysters, and can produce an outbreak of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP).Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC's Laboratory Response to Toxins (accessed: May 8, 2012) Saxitoxin analogues associated to PSP can be divided into three categories: * Carbamate compounds, including saxitoxin, neosaxitoxin and gonyautoxins 1‚Äì4. * N-sulfocarbamoyl compounds, including C and B toxins. * Decarbamoyl compounds with respect to the presence or absence of 1-N-hydroxyl, 11-hydroxysulfate, and 21-N-sulfocarbamoyl substitutions as well as epimerization at the C-11 position. Structure and properties NSTX is quite similar to saxitoxin, like all the neurotoxins associated to PSP, the only difference is that NSTX shows one hydroxyl group bonded to nitrogen \\"1\\", where saxitoxyn contains one hydrogen. This purine is highly hydrophilic and thermostable, it is not destroyed by cooking. Moreover, is very stable in usual storage, specially in acidic condition. Mechanism of action NSTX blocks the extracellular portion, the outer vestibule, of some voltage gated sodium channels in a very powerful and reversible manner, without affection of other ion channels. \\"Voltage-gated\\", also called \\"voltage-sensitive\\" and \\"voltage-dependent\\" sodium channel also known as \\"VGSCs\\" or \\"Nav channel\\" are crucial elements of normal physiology in a variety of animals, including flies, leeches, squid and jellyfish, as well as mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates. This large integral membrane protein plays an essential role in the initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons, myocytes and other excitable cells. Nav channels form the basis for electrical excitability in animals. Nav channels evolved from Ca2+ channels and were present in the common ancestor of choanoflagellates and animals, although this channel was likely permeable to both Na+ and Ca2+. Thus, like many other neuronal channels and receptors, Nav channels predated neurons. Invertebrates possess two Nav channels (Nav1 and Nav2), whereas vertebrate Nav channels are of the Nav1 family. Sodium-channel proteins in the mammalian brain are composed of an association that include one alpha subunit and one or more auxiliary beta subunits. Nine types of alpha subunits have been described (Nav1.1 to Nav1.9), and a tenth related isoform (Nax) may also play some role as a Nav channel. Based in this information, ten Nav classes can be described: Nav1.1 to Nav1.9, and Nax. Former five, but more recently, six neurotoxin receptor sites have been recognized between the seven receptor site located in the vertebrate sodium channel receptor alpha subunit: * Site 1 binds the sodium channel blockers tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin. * Site 2 binds lipid-soluble sodium channel activators such as veratridine. * Site 3 binds alpha-scorpion and sea anemone toxins, which slow sodium channel inactivation. * Site 4 binds beta- scorpion toxins, which affect sodium channel activation. * Site 5 binds the polyether ladder brevetoxins and ciguatoxin. * Site 6 binds delta-conotoxin. * Local anesthetic receptor site binds local anesthetics, antiarrhythmic drugs and antiepileptic drugs NSTX and other site 1 blockers have high affinity (very low dissociation constant) and high specificity for Nav channels. The action of NSTX produces minimal effect on cardiac Nav, where it exhibits about 20‚Äì60 fold lesser affinity than in Nav channels from rat skeletal muscle and rat brain. Most data emphasize the role of \\"STX resistant\\" Nav channel 1.5 in human heart. Toxins such as neosaxitoxin and tetrodotoxin have less affinity for most cardiac Nav channels than for most Nav channels in nerve tissue. Moreover, NSTX is so active on nerve Nav channel than is roughly a million- fold more potent than lidocaine. Effects on human This mechanism of action can produce two well known kinds of effects in human: =Toxic effect, associated to plasmatic levels of NSTX= It can be approximately described using one of the classical model of neurotoxic disease, known from ancient times as red tide, the most harmful algal bloom (HAB). This well known clinical model is the \\"paralytic shellfish poisoning\\".FAO FOOD AND NUTRITION PAPER 80. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Chapter 2. Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP). Rome, 2004(accessed: May 6, 2012) Of course, there are great differences between different algal blooms, (accessed: May 9, 2012) (accessed: May 11, 2012) because of the mix of species included in each HAB, usually related to environmental conditions; because of the levels and quality of PSTs produced in each HAB, that may be modulated by concurrent microorganism; and, last but not least, because of the specific properties of each kind of PST, for example: * Brevetoxins are lipid-soluble (hydrophobic) polyether marine toxins; their predominant effect is excitatory (blocked by tetrodotoxin), mediated by the enhancement of cellular Na+ influx; and bind to site 5 on Nav (like ciguatoxin). * Tetrodotoxin (TTX) toxicity is associated with marked and surprising cardiovascular effects (i.e.: hypotension and bradycardia). Those effects are unexpected because of notorious TTX-resistance observed in vertebrate cardiac Nav channel. Moreover, this characteristic of the mammalian cardiac Nav channel is attributed to the cardiac predominance of the TTX-resistant Nav channel isoform (Nav1.5). On the contrary, as presumed on physiologyc basis, NSTX produces just mild and transient cardiovascular abnormalities during experimental intoxication (there are no data on pure NSTX clinical toxicity). * STX has two positive charges, in contrast to TTX's single charge and GTX2/3, a naturally occurring STX congener with a net +1 charge. In view of their rather different structures, it is not surprising that STX and TTX bind in a different fashion to VGSCs. In fact, when Phe 385 near the selectivity filter of Nav1.2 is mutated to Cys, the channel's affinity for TTX is reduced 3,000-fold, whereas that for STX is reduced (only) 340-fold. * There are very limited data on the relative potency of different PSTs, and developing alternative methods to animal bioassays for marine-toxin detection is an urgent need. In spite of its heterogeneous and poorly understood epidemiology, the clinical picture of PSP could be useful to anticipate clinical effects of systemic NSTX. * In the most frequent and benign situation, the patient suffers just mild, short-lived paresthesias of the mouth or extremities. * In moderate cases perioral tingling progressing to numbness spreading to face and neck can be observed.Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning. Fleming LE. Last updated: May 7, 2008 (accessed: May 8, 2012) * In severe cases, patient can suffer apnea secondary to motor block, requiring mechanical ventilation. Usually, the victims of mild and severe acute intoxications eliminate the toxin in urine during the first 24 hours after ingestion, and improve to full recovery in the first day of intrahospital care (when vital support is provided in a timely manner).(accessed: May 8, 2012) When outbreaks of PSP occur in remote locations, where medical assistance is limited, reported lethality is under 10% in adults, but can reach 50% in children younger than six years old. This difference could be secondary to dissimilar doses and composition of involved mixes of PSTs; delay in medical support; or some kind of susceptibility of children. More recent information suggest that lethality could be around 1% of symptomatic patients, including cases where air transportation was required from remote locations of Alaska. Electrophysiologic observations demonstrated sub clinical abnormalities lasting for some days or weeks after clinical recovery . Some evidence suggest the presence of metabolic pathways for the sequential oxidation and glucuronidation of PST in vitro, both being the initial detoxication reactions for the excretion of these toxins in humans. Forensic analysis of fatalities after severe cases, conclude that PSP toxins are metabolically transformed by humans and that they are removed from the body by excretion in the urine and feces like any other xenobiotic compound. Considering the heterogeneous nature of toxins mixes contained in contaminated bivalve molluscs, the safe limit of toxin content in shellfish adequate for human ingestion is expressed in \\"saxitoxin equivalents\\". According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and European Parliament, this limit is 80 microgram of saxitoxin equivalent per 100 gram of mussel meat (each mussel weights around 23 g).FAO Food and Nutrition Paper 80. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Chapter 8. Risk Assessment. Rome, 2004. (accessed: May 6, 2012) (accessed: May 6, 2012) The U.S. Food and Drug Administration extends the same definition to \\"fish\\" quality, but the term \\"fish\\" refers to fresh or saltwater fin fish, crustaceans, other forms of aquatic animal life other than birds or mammals, and all mollusks; and incorporate the use of \\"ppm\\" as another measure for saxitoxin equivalent concentration in mentioned foods.U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guidance, Fourth Edition, November 2011. Chapter 6: Natural Toxins (p. 99‚Äì112). (accessed: May 6, 2012) Paradoxically, the chronic and/or repeated exposure to marine seafood toxins, which is a much more realistic phenomenon, has not been fully examined.Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Marine Biotoxins and Harmful Algae: A National Plan. Chapter II. THE TOXINS. Risk Assessment. (accessed: May 8, 2012) One study in rats exposed to chronic (12 weeks) NSTX administration demonstrated some reduction in water and food intake, and a mild degree of transient cholestasis, probably associated to fasting, without other abnormalities. =Anesthetic effect, produced by local infiltration of NSTX= This action has been demonstrated in animals and humans. The medical use of the NSTX anesthetic effect is supported by three reasons: #NSTX anesthetic duration: #* Any current available local anesthetic hardly produces clinical effects 12 hours after a single injection. (accessed: May 10, 2012) Then, in cases of severe or prolonged pain, some patients need repeated injections, catheters, pumps and opioids to feel comfortable, with different kinds of side effects, costs and risks. #* On the other hand, NSTX local infiltration produces long lasting anesthesia, well over all the current available local anesthetics. Some investigations demonstrated anesthetic effect lasting over one week after single injection in rodents, using extended release formulation, without histologic or functional sequelae. #* Additionally, two human reports demonstrated strong potentiation between NSTX anesthetic effect, bupivacaine and epinephrine. #NSTX local safety: #* All available local anesthetic are associated with local damage in different models. This undesired effect could be enhanced by sustained release formulations. #* On the contrary, several investigations show local safety of saxitoxin-related neurotoxins, including very sensitive models, and there is no reason to presume otherwise for NSTX. #NSTX systemic safety: #* In spite of advances of ultrasound guided injections, acute systemic local anesthetic toxicity is still an unsolved clinical problem, and can produce devastating consequences, related to the neurologic and cardiovascular effects of all available local anesthetics. #* Otherwise, clinical experience and animal models shows the relative safety of accidental and experimental NSTX intoxication (when appropriate support therapy is provided in a timely manner). (accessed: May 8, 2012) #* Recent investigation in sheep shows a safe limit, due to motor block, over 1 ¬µg/kg for intravenous injection of NSTX, with full recovery after a brief course of mechanical ventilation. #* Regarding systemic safety, saxitoxins diffuse through the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, but, because of Nav channel specificity, acute toxicity is associated to a very low risk of seizures. This establishes an important difference with current local anesthetic toxicity. #* As could be predicted from its ion channel selectivity, NSTX intoxication clinical picture is almost devoid of arrhythmias, establishing another difference with available local anesthetic's numerous cardiac effects. #* And last but not least, some degree of improving in therapeutic index of NSTX can be observed when is mixed with bupivacaine and/or epinephrine. In conclusion, NSTX is a well defined molecule with a long-lasting and sometimes dangerous relationship with human subjects. Recent investigations suggest a clinical application as a new local anesthetic that sounds \\"too good to be true\\", but more investigation is required.

It is currently in the permanent collection at the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Description The subject appears to be a young saleswoman, observed in a Parisian hat shop. She is seen from above and behind, and her back is straitlaced and proper. Her hair is tied in a tight bun at the base of her skull, and her straight bangs are over her eyes. Her jacket is a deep blue and is the focal point of the drawing. She looks impatient, her arms crossed and her nose up in the air, and she seems to be absorbed in herself, paying little to no attention to the customers around her. Historical information According to Mary Cassatt, Degas' prot√©g√©e and friend, Degas often asked her to pose for him after going with her to the dressmaker's or the milliner's. He often asked her to assume a role or a stance he saw while out with her, especially if the pose was difficult. This separated Degas from the other Impressionists of the time, as working in a studio is decidedly not spontaneous.

It was released for iOS devices on the App Store on September 1, 2011, and has been ported to other systems. It was released online as a Flash version on May 11, 2012; on Android on September 28; on PlayStation Portable (via PlayStation Network, ported by Beatshapers) on November 20 in North America and November 21 in Europe; on BlackBerry PlayBook on December 13, 2012; on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita (via PlayStation Network, ported by Big Ant Studios) on December 21 in Europe and December 31 in North America; on BlackBerry 10 on March 6, 2013; and on Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 on June 5. It was also released on PlayStation 4 on April 26, 2016. There is also a real-time tabletop adaptation of the game by Lucky Duck Games. The game features the same protagonist from Age of Zombies and Monster Dash, Barry Steakfries, who the player controls as he steals a jet pack from a top-secret laboratory. The game has been met with very favorable reviews, and has won numerous awards. Gameplay Barry flies through a volcano. Below him is a scientist. In front of him is an electric zapper. The game uses a simple, one-touch system to control the jetpack; when the player presses anywhere on the touchscreen, the jetpack fires and Barry rises. When the player lets go, the jetpack turns off, and Barry falls. Because he is continually in motion, the player does not control his speed, simply his movement along the vertical axis. The objective of the game is to travel as far as possible, collect coins, and avoid hazards such as zappers, missiles and high-intensity laser beams. Contact with any of such obstacles would result in instant death, although Barry's body will tumble and slide for an additional distance upon dying. As the player travels, golden coloured \\"Spin Tokens\\" occasionally appear, which the player can collect. At the end of each run, these spin tokens are used in a slot machine (one token gives one spin) which can award the player various prizes, including coins, additional spin tokens, a head- start, a player revival, and explosives that can propel the player's body for an additional distance after death. If the player does not wish to spin the slot, they can cash in all remaining spin tokens for 50 coins each. Rainbow- coloured boxes with gears can also be found throughout the game. When touched by the player, these boxes provide Barry with a vehicle which lasts until he hits an obstacle. The available vehicles are \\"Bad As Hog\\" (a chopper), \\"Mr. Cuddles\\" (a mecha dragon), \\"Crazy Freaking Teleporter\\" (a teleport device), \\"Gravity Suit\\" (the suit used by Gravity Guy, providing the same ability), \\"Profit Bird\\" (a bird-shaped plane which ejects banknotes), \\"Lil' Stomper\\" a mech suit, and \\"Wave Rider\\" (a jet ski). Also available until January 1, 2014 is \\"Sleigh of Awesome\\" (a sleigh drawn by two reindeer). These vehicles are also available in Magnetic and Golden upgrades that can be purchased for coins in \\"The Stash\\" (the in-game store). In a later update, the \\"Strong Arm Machine\\" (S.A.M.) was introduced. The only obstacles faced while wearing the S.A.M. are missiles, which the player must deflect with its arm. This vehicle, unlike the others, is only available after the player has collected three puzzle pieces, spelling \\"SAM\\", in one day. If the player activates the S.A.M. five days in a row, a special costume is made available. The Stash also sells aesthetic upgrades such as character outfits and different jetpacks. Most of these items do not alter the gameplay in any way, though alternative jetpacks can be useful in achieving some of the missions (such as travelling a distance without harming any scientists). Limited use utilities are also for sale, as are gadgets and vehicle upgrades. Gadgets provide permanent enhancements for the player, but Barry can have only two gadgets equipped at any one time, however, they can purchase an item that permanently increases that number to 3. Players can also access their profile from within The Stash, view achievements on Game Center or Google Play Games, and purchase coins with real world money. At any time in the game, the player is provided with three missions, such as high-fiving (running past) a certain number of scientists, avoiding coins for a set distance, flying close to a certain number of zappers, or having a near miss with a set number of missiles. Each individual mission carries one to three stars, depending on its difficulty. When each mission is completed, the stars are added to the player's experience level and a fresh mission appears (unless the player has enough missions to make it past level 15). Once the number of stars required for the experience level are obtained, the player's level increases and a coin reward is given. Once the highest level is reached, the player is given the choice of either playing the game without any more missions, or trading the level 15 stars to start the game with new missions. The level titles (e.g. \\"Graduate\\", \\"Ninja\\") remain the same, but the level numbers increase, so a player will start from level 16 with the title \\"Badger\\". If the player cashes in their stars, they are also given one of 125 badges selected at random, showing that the complete set of missions have been achieved. Players can cash in stars multiple times once they reach the title \\"Barry\\", to collect more badges and reach a higher level number. Mission unlocks are available in The Stash, which allow the player to get the stars for a mission without completing the mission through gameplay, at the cost of 500 coins per star.  Jetpacks  = Non Event/Non Limited Time Jetpacks = The game features twenty six unique unlock-able jetpacks that are not associated with any given event or limited time deal. These include: * Angel Wings * Flying V Jetpack * Twister Jetpack * Teddy Jetpack * Snow Machine Jetpack * Water Jetpack * Traditional Jetpack * Shark Head Jetpack * Steam Powered Jetpack * Red Barry Jetpack * Rainbow Jetpack * Party Jetpack * Big Bertha * Machine Gun Jetpack * Leaf Blower Jetpack * Laser Jetpack * Jack-O-Lantern Jetpack * Helicopter Jetpack * Gold Platinum MGJP * Gold Plated Shark Head Jetpack * Golden Piggy Pack * DIY Jetpack * Deck The Halls * Chrome Plated Afterburner * Bubble Gum Jetpack * Blast Off Jetpack = Other = * Random Jetpack - This is not so much as a Jetpack as it is an ability that, when equipped will choose at random a jetpack that you own and have Barry use it next round. * Amped Up '85 Guitar Jetpack - This jetpack could only be obtained through purchasing the Future Forever Pack from the 2015 Back to the Future Event. Synopsis Barry Steakfries works as a salesman for a gramophone-making company, but the business is about to go bankrupt due to low sales. One day, as he walks down a street, sad because of the low sales, he finds one of the \\"top secret\\" laboratories of Legitimate Research, and sees the Machinegun jetpack inside. Dreaming of using the jetpack to do good, Barry bursts through the wall of the laboratory and steals the experimental jetpack from the clutches of the scientists, thus beginning the game. Development and release The game was titled Machine Gun Jetpack during development. It was released on the App Store on September 1, 2011. Subsequent upgrades included add-ons such as different jetpacks, utilities and gadgets to assist the player, as well as providing support for the Retina Display. The game was launched on Facebook as a Beta on May 11, 2012. It was subsequently ported to Android devices, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, BlackBerry PlayBook, BlackBerry 10 and Windows Phone 8. Reception and awards Jetpack Joyride received predominantly positive reviews. The iOS version holds an aggregate score of 90 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 27 reviews, and 93.00% on GameRankings, based on ten reviews. The PSP version holds a score of 78.50% on GameRankings, based on four reviews. IGN's Justin Davis scored the iOS version 9 out of 10, calling it \\"the most addictive game from Halfbrick after the seminal Fruit Ninja\\", praising the random levels (\\"Halfbrick smartly included the perfect amount of randomness, to keep Joyride spicy. Players never quite know where the next missile will come from, or how the next set of lasers will be configured. It makes narrow escapes feel exhilarating\\"), boosts, and, especially, the \\"one more game\\" element of the three mission system. He was less impressed with the PSN version, scoring it 7.4 out of 10. He was critical of the lack of an online leaderboard (arguing \\"this makes Jetpack Joyride a high score game without any actual online competition\\") and the lack of HD graphics for the Vita and PlayStation 3, concluding that \\"Jetpack Joyrides inferior visuals, lack of online leaderboards and higher price tag make it inferior to the iOS and Android experience.\\" Eurogamer's Kristan Reed scored the game 8 out of 10, writing \\"Jetpack Joyride is further evidence of Halfbrick's unseemly knack for producing games designed to test both the battery life of handheld gaming platforms and the sanity of players. Needless to say, both run out eventually.\\" Destructoid's Nick Chester scored it 9 out of 10, arguing that in the crowded field of endless runners, \\"Jetpack Joyride is comfortably the best in its class.\\" He was particularly impressed with the mission system, depth of extra features and responsive controls, calling the game \\"a hallmark of excellence [...] a supreme title.\\" TouchArcade's Eli Hodapp scored it 5 out of 5 and called it a game \\"you simply must own.\\" Carter Dobson of 148Apps also scored it 5 out of 5, calling it \\"one of the best endless games on the App Store.\\" AppSpy's Andrew Nesvadba also awarded a score of 5 out of 5, writing \\"While touch-to-fly style endless games are nothing new, Jetpack Joyride trumps them all by packing together gorgeous designs with fun gameplay and replay value that's bursting at the seams.\\" AppSmile cited it as \\"a terrific example of iDevice gaming done just right.\\" Pocket Gamer's Mark Brown scored it 9 out of 10, giving it a \\"Gold Award\\" and praising the gameplay, graphics and depth; \\"Jetpack Joyride is simplistic fun, but Halfbrick's suite of bonuses, unlockables, leaderboards, and achievements makes it near irresistible.\\" It was awarded \\"Best App Ever 2011\\" by 148Apps, and won Pocket Gamer's \\"Best Action/Arcade Game of the Year 2012\\", \\"iPhone/iPod Touch Game of the Year 2012\\" and \\"Overall Game of the Year 2012\\" awards. It was also nominated for \\"Best Casual Game\\" at the 2012 International Mobile Gaming Awards, losing to Sprinkle, and it was the runner-up \\"iPhone Game Of The Year\\" on the App Store's \\"App Store Rewind 2011\\", losing to Tiny Tower.

History  The newspaper was born from an idea of Sidney Sonnino and Antonio Salandra, two political exponents of the Historical Right, and in particular representatives of the component of Conservative liberalism. The two founders chose together the name of the newspaper and its editor; after consulting with Luigi Albertini, director of the Corriere della Sera, the choice fell on Alberto Bergamini, who had demonstrated strong organizational skills.Official site of Senato della Repubblica Italiana In 1901 the editor Alberto Bergamini created the \\"la Terza Pagina\\" (\\"Third Page\\"), featuring essays in literature, philosophy, criticism, the arts, and politics by eminent intellectuals, including Alessandro D'Ancona, Giuseppe Chiarini, Domenico Gnoli, Raffaele De Cesare, Antonio Fogazzaro, Luigi Capuana, Luigi Pirandello, Cesare De Lollis, Attilio Momigliano, Salvatore Di Giacomo, Alfredo Panzini, Pasquale Villari and Benedetto Croce. The upscale press quickly followed suit with their own versions. The death of founder Sydney Sonnino in 1922 and a violent Black shirt attack on Bergamini that forced him to resign in 1923, had a devastating impact. The newspaper never recovered its prestige.Frank J. Coppa, ed., Dictionary of Modern Italian History (1995), pp 43, 184-85, 409 Folco Testena served as the editor-in-chief of Il Giornale d'Italia in the 1930s. Until his editorship the paper was a patriotic and monarchist publication. Then it became a supporter of the fascist regime in Italy. The paper had its headquarters in Rome. The magazine with the same name, an organ of the political movement Pensionati uomini vivi, is an unrelated publication.

He is the older brother of San Diego Padres pitcher Drew Pomeranz. Professional career Pomeranz was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the second round of the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft out of Houston High School in Germantown, Tennessee. Pomeranz made his professional debut with Rookie League Johnson City, where in 4 appearances, he was 1-1 with a 6.14 ERA. In his first full season, Pomeranz pitched with Single-A Peoria, where in 17 starts, he was 12-4 with a 3.55 ERA, striking out 88 in 101.1 innings. His 12 victories were the most in the Cardinals minor league system in 2004. Pomeranz began 2005 with High-A Palm Beach, where he pitched well in 8 starts before earning a promotion to Double-A Springfield, where he didn't pitch as well in 18 starts.

Based on trends in economic development, population growth, and land use, China's natural landscape will experience significant and increasing pressures well into the future. Urbanization China has four times the population of the U.S., within roughly the same area. With 1.3 billion inhabitants, 20% of the world's population lives in China. While the rate of population growth has been declining for decades, the total number of inhabitants has been growing and is expected to do so through 2030. China's urban population is growing rapidly; between 1950 and 2009, the percentage of the population living in urban areas quadrupled from 14% to 48%. Meanwhile, the rural population is declining, opening the landscape in areas that are not urbanized. The forests and farming land of eastern China support far more people and major cities than do the grasslands, deserts, and high mountain regions of the west. Cultivated land The vast majority of China's cultivated land lies in eastern China. Nearly all of the arable land, totaling 122 million hectares or 13% of the country, is cultivated. To ensure adequate food production, the government has identified a minimum threshold or ‚Äúredline‚Äù of 120 million hectares of cultivated land. Chinese law also requires a one-to-one replacement (in quantity and quality of farmland that is converted to other uses). These policies, combined with development and other land use pressures, are shifting the location of farmland. Some cultivated lands are being newly created from other uses such as forestry, grasslands, and wetlands while existing cultivated lands are being converted to other uses such as built-up areas, forests, and grasslands Livestock grazing Livestock grazing occurs throughout China and is possibly the most common use of grasslands. China is the world's largest producer of sheep and goats, and the fourth largest producer of cattle. Livestock grazing is a major driver of grassland degradation in China. The government has instituted a variety of programs to combat desertification, which has slowed to 3,000 km2 per year. Forest uses Since the late 1950s, China's forests have experienced several periods of significant deforestation, which contributed to related environmental disasters such as the Yangtze River flood in 1998. In response, the Central Government has attempted to restore forest cover by investing upwards of 1 trillion RMB into six forest conservation programs, the most significant of which include Grain to Green (1999‚Äì2016) and the Natural Forest Protection Program (NFPP) (1998‚Äì2020). These programs combine afforestation efforts (primarily in northern China) and timber harvesting bans or limits to restore forest cover. Forest cover was 20% as of 2008; the Central Government aims to achieve 23% forest cover by 2020, and 26% by 2050. Mining and Energy Development China has one of the largest mining sectors in the world and is the world's largest energy producer. Energy production is on the rise, which will impact biodiversity as China constructs more mines, oil and gas wells, dams and hydropower stations, wind farms, pipelines, and other infrastructure. In particular, western and central China will experience increasing energy development because they hold many untapped and lesser tapped oil and gas fields, coal reserves, and areas with the highest potential for wind and solar energy production Transportation China is expanding its road and rail networks, investing 5 trillion RMB to construct 40,000 km of railroads by 2020. The vast majority of planned and existing transit is located in eastern China. Secondary road construction is more of an emphasis in western China. The rail network is expanding nationwide to connect most cities with populations of at least 200,000.

Also included are accounts of Sadrist-organized protests and other forms of collective actions intended to influence domestic and international policymakers in Iraq, foreign nations, and international institutions. There is a continuing focus on the activities of the Mumahidun, the social and cultural wing of Al-Sadr's office which was borne out of Sadrist efforts to transition former Jaysh Al-Mahdi members into more mainstream functional roles. Absent from the section are reports of armed actions taken by Sadrist-affiliated groups against Iraqi security forces or United States forces in Iraq. =Iraq News= The Iraq News section of the website includes reporting and commentary on politics and economic development throughout the country. The section highlights Sadrist officials' roles in Iraq's political process and events in southern Iraq in particular. Stories about problems associated with uneven development in the Iraqi housing, agricultural, and oil sectors are covered regularly, and Sadrist actions to rectify shortcomings in these areas are detailed accordingly. Violence in the form of bombings, assassinations, and kidnappings are reported along with condemnations by the High Board for Politics of Al-Sadr's Office. Arrests of members of Sadrist groups have been criticized as arbitrary detentions. The section tackles issues of corruption in the Iraqi government. The persistent electrical power shortfalls in southern Iraqi provinces are addressed by the site's staff. =Arab and World News= The Arab and World News section of Al- Sadr online covers world events significant to the Sadrist Movement and to Shia Muslims. The site publishes stories relaying Iranian government statements on the efforts of the United States and some European nations to halt the Iranian nuclear program. The site's staff has made concurrent efforts in this forum to counter accusations that the Sadrist Movement is overly compliant with Iranian political demands, even renouncing Iranian statements regarding Iraqi sovereignty issues on occasion. There are stories critical of Israel and Arab countries with which it maintains relations. The site gives ample coverage to movements demanding greater rights for Shia minorities in nations such as Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Yemen. The activities of affiliated political organizations such as Hezbollah are related in this section as well. The site has documented the Arab Spring series of revolutions with stories supportive of dissidents, with those from Syria being the notable exception. =Religious Opinions= The Religious Opinions column of Al-Sadr online is the official medium for broadcasting Muqtada Al-Sadr's controversial fatwa-like rulings on religious, social, and political issues. Al-Sadr has attained the clerical position of Hojatoleslam, which does not qualify him to render religious opinions (perform Ijtihad) as would an Ayatollah in the traditions of Shia Islamic jurisprudence. Al-Sadr has asserted wide latitude to interpret the previous rulings of his father, Muhammad Muhammad Sadeq Al- Sadr and relate them to contemporary issues. Despite the opposition of many Shia institutions, Muqtada Al-Sadr's rulings are widely accepted by his youthful following. The rulings, which are generally initiated by queries from Al-Sadr followers, provide religious justification for resistance against United States forces in Iraq as well as purging Ba'athist elements from the government. The rulings also clarify Al-Sadr's positions with respect to his support for the State of Law Coalition led by Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki. Since 2010, Al-Sadr has taken on social and cultural issues more frequently, with statements advocating restrictions on mixing of genders and prohibition of alcohol among those posted by Al-Sadr Online. =Other Media= Features unique to the Arabic language version of the site include links to affiliate media organizations, video clips of Sadrist commemorations and other events of note, and features on Shia Islamic philosophy. In addition, there are sections detailing the activities of international Sadrist Movement offices. An Interviews and Investigations column posts exchanges with key figures in Iraqi society and examines post-conflict lives of Iraqi citizens. Trends in Reporting and Commentary =Iraq War Era= The early years of Al-Sadr Online coincided with the fallout from the Charge of the Knights operation in Basra and other areas of southern Iraq, during which Sadrist militias were expelled from urban areas. During this period, Sadrist Movement leaders shifted the priorities of the organization, transitioning former Jaysh Al- Mahdi fighters into roles supporting the Mumahidun, the social and cultural wing of the party. The reporting on the website reflected this shift, as the activities of the Muhamidun were given ample space on its pages. The movement was also experiencing challenges with breakaway factions such as Asa'ib Ahl Al-Haq, and anti-dissident commentary became more prevalent. Reports on United States Forces' presence in Iraq were harshly critical. The site also provided guidance and context to Sadrist political activities during the run-up to the Iraqi parliamentary elections of 2010 and afterward as political blocs negotiated leadership positions in the government. =United States Forces Withdrawal from Iraq= As United States Forces withdrew from Iraq, Al-Sadr Online addressed a number of challenges and opportunities facing the movement. Negotiations for continuing U.S. military presence in the country failed to establish a status of status of forces agreement which would allow continued cooperation. Al-Sadr Online portrayed residual U.S. political and economic influences in the country as an enduring threat to Iraqi sovereignty. At the same time, the site outlined the Sadrist Movement's plans for demobilizing the armed Promised Day Brigades while maintaining a capability to activate militia members in cases of threats to the organizations agenda. The withdrawal also allowed the Sadrist Movement to renew calls for release of militia members from prisons, and the site's staff wrote pieces advocating for their pardons. Al-Sadr Online began to emphasize coverage of Sadrist education and community service projects during this time period. =Post-War= The Arab Spring uprisings commencing in early 2011 opened up a new front in the media campaign of the Sadrist Movement. Al-Sadr Online generally was supportive of the rebels in the affected countries for a variety of reasons. Bahrain's sizable Shia minority looked to Iraq for support for its demands for greater political access, and Al-Sadr Online responded with favorable portrayals of Bahraini protesters. The Muammar Qaddafi regime in Libya was suspected of ordering the killing of Muqtada Al-Sadr's relative Musa Al-Sadr, and Libyan rebels received favorable coverage from the site's writers. The insurgency in Yemen included Shia Huthi rebels from the northwestern region of the country, and protesters of the Ali Abdullah Saleh regime received favorable treatment by Al-Sadr Online. The Hosni Mubarak regime's relations with Israel and tense relationship with Iran earned it negative coverage from Al-Sadr Online as Egyptian security forces attempted to quell demonstrations. As demonstrations were violently suppressed in Syria, however, Al-Sadr Online took a different tone similar to that of the Syrian government, pushing for dialogue and resisting calls for regime change. Aside from the Arab Spring coverage, Al- Sadr Online highlighted the Sadrist Movement's efforts to reach out to other religious groups in Iraq, featuring meetings at Christian churches, Mandaean gatherings, and events in Sunni and Kurdish regions. Al-Sadr Online has documented the role that Muqtada Al-Sadr has staked out as an intermediary between Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki and Sunni and Kurdish politicians threatening secession of northern provinces from Iraq. =References= External links * Al-Sadr Online Category:2008 establishments in Iraq Category:Internet properties established in 2008 Category:Iraqi journalism organizations Category:Iraq War Category:Occupation of Iraq Category:Politics of Iraq Category:Arabic-language websites Category:Iraqi websites ","title":"Al-Sadr Online"},{"id":"35742006","text":"Fussell is a surname.

One of many versions of the subject painted by Cranach, this one, created in 1532, is now in the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Description The bottom half of the painting is crowded with figures, all symbolically arranged to the left and the right of Christ. On the right is the Virgin Mary, who is held by John the Evangelist, and Mary Magdalene is holding onto the Cross. The Good Thief and Longinus gaze directly at him, alluding to their salvation. There is a sharp contrast to those on the right, which includes Roman soldiers who are avoiding his gaze and the Impenitent thief, depicted as bald and bloated. Behind them are contemporary figures, who are considered unenlightened, as they have not yet borne witness to Christ. The painting emphasizes Jesus Christ's sacrifice, and uses the witnesses to show recognition of the event of his death as a clear reference to new Lutheran theology; sinful mankind is only redeemed through Christ, not through the Catholic church. Historical information Cranach was the court painter to the electors of Saxony in Wittenberg, an area in the heart of the emerging Protestant faith. His patrons were powerful supporters of Martin Luther, and Cranach used his art as a symbol of the new faith. Cranach made numerous portraits of Luther, and provided woodcut illustrations for Luther's German translation of the Bible. Crucifixion should be seen through the lens of this new reformed religion. =Acquisition= The Indianapolis Museum of Art purchased the painting in 2000, using funding from the Clowes Collection.

It was shot between 1997 and 1999 in Canada, the United States, Switzerland and India, and is a \\"fragmented narrative\\" that shows what people do to discover themselves and find happiness. The film was screened at film festivals in a number of countries across the world, including Canada, Switzerland, the United States, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Japan, Australia and South Africa. It won several awards, including the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television's 2003 Genie Award for \\"Best Documentary\\".  Synopsis  Gambling, Gods and LSD is a \\"travel diary\\" that loosely documents director Peter Mettler's \\"introspective journey\\" through four countries: Canada, the United States, Switzerland and India. The film consists of four segments, each showing what people do to discover themselves and find happiness. The first segment takes place in Mettler's hometown of Toronto where he interviews John Paul Young about finding God. Mettler also visits the Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship Church who chant, dance and roll on the floor of an airport hangar where they believe Jesus once visited. In the next segment petroglyphs and snakes are observed in Monument Valley in Southwestern United States, and time is spent in Las Vegas, where gamblers are scrutinized at their slot machines and poker tables. Here Mettler also interviews a sex toy salesman who promises clients a \\"non-chemical induced illusion of their fantasy\\" with his orgasmatron (sex chair) and other devices. In the third segment, Mettler interviews the Swiss scientist who discovered LSD, Albert Hofmann, who bemoans the fact that Timothy Leary's \\"flamboyant ... overly simplifi[cation]\\" of the drug made doing serious research on it \\"impossible\\". Hofmann also explains his theory of \\"horizontal genetics\\" which suggests that human individuality does not exist. In Z√ºrich Mettler interviews a couple addicted to heroin, visits \\"poodle racers\\" and a techno rave. The last segment is filmed in Bombay (now Mumbai), and in Hampi, former capital of the ancient Vijayanagara Empire in Southern India. The scenes here include following a pilgrimage ceremony that culminates in dar≈õana (\\"looking at a deity\\"), and a visit to the Bombay Laughing Club where members find solace in laughing and making faces at one another.  Background  Mettler came to prominence in 1982 when the Toronto Festival of Festivals screened his first full-length film, Scissere. He started contemplating Gambling, Gods and LSD in 1988, but it was only after he finished Picture of Light in 1994 that he started working on the project full- time. Filming began in late 1997 and finished in early 1999. Mettler usually travelled on his own, doing all the interviewing, camera work and directing himself, with the occasional help of locals in some of the cities. He spent close to two years on the road, and said that no retakes were done and no multi-camera setups were used. The film was unscripted‚ÄîMettler said, \\"[it] was making itself while I acted as a medium\\". Mettler approached Gambling, Gods and LSD with four themes in mind: \\"transcendence, the denial of death, our relationship to nature and the illusion of safety\\". He investigated the fringe cultures of Toronto, Las Vegas, Zurich and Southern India, and said the film is about finding what people's addictions are, what they do to escape reality and give meaning to their lives. Mettler said this endeavor turned out to be his own escape and addiction. Mettler began editing the film in early 1999 outside Zurich with Roland Schlimme (Manufactured Landscapes, Act of God). More than 50 hours of film, and hundreds of hours of video were shot to produce the final three-hour cut, which he said was like \\"composing a piece of music\\". Fifty-two hours of assembled edit was unreleased, from which Mettler believes another film could be culled. Gambling, Gods and LSD does not conform to any of the traditional documentary genres. Mettler said that the film \\"is in part about the breaking down of categories or prejudices ... It invites the viewer to go on a journey, to actively participate in the making of meaning and the opening of senses ... [and] make associations between what they see and their own personal experience\\". The title of the film came from a list of peak experiences, addictions and escapes he had been investigating. Mettler has cited Andrei Tarkovsky and Michelangelo Antonioni as film directors who have influenced him.  Reception  Stephen Lan, writing in Take One: Film & Television in Canada, commended director Mettler's \\"three-hour epic\\" for making viewers \\"think for themselves\\". Lan described Gambling, Gods and LSD as a \\"visual and aural enigma\\" and said that it is \\"boldly unique\\" because of its elusiveness, prompting audiences to form their own interpretations and decide for themselves what the film is all about. He said that in spite of the film's \\"elliptical non-narrative structure\\" and \\"multiplicity of layers\\", it does not feel longer than most feature-length films, and \\"deserves ... several viewings, each bound to provide drastically new and different insights\\". In a review of the film at Montreal's 2002 Festival du nouveau cin√©ma (where it won the \\"Best Documentary Award\\"), Donato Totaro said Gambling, Gods and LSD is a \\"fragmented narrative\\" and \\"a modern variant of the wonderful, old tradition of the city film\\". He compared the film to Man with a Movie Camera (1929, Dziga Vertov), Koyaanisqatsi (1982, Godfrey Reggio) and Baraka (1992, Ron Fricke). In Exclaim!, Michelle Devereaux called the film a \\"heady, transfixing meditation on the idea of meditation and transcendence itself\\". While Time Out found the film \\"a little pretentious\\", it said it is \\"compelling, exhilarating, funny, imaginative and ... wise\\". Jamie Russell at BBC Online said the film is \\"agonisingly tedious viewing\\" and that it \\"mimics the mind- altering, flattened out monotony of an acid trip\\". He complained that the point of the film's \\"unrelated segments\\" are never explained, and felt that the nature shots separating these segments are \\"nothing but marking time for the sake of it\\".

The film was directed by Chris James Thompson and stars Andrew Swant as Dahmer in fictionalized re-enactment segments which are interwoven with interviews of the medical examiner assigned to the case (Jeffrey Jentzen), the lead detective (Pat Kennedy), and Dahmer's next door neighbor (Pamela Bass). The film premiered at the 2012 SXSW film festival under the title Jeff, where it received positive reviews and obtained sales representation from Josh Braun at Submarine Entertainment. The film also played at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival in Toronto, the Independent Film Festival of Boston, and the Maryland Film Festival in Baltimore. The documentary was picked up by IFC Films who re-titled it The Jeffrey Dahmer Files. Jonathan Sehring, President of Sundance Selects/IFC Films, said: ‚ÄúChris James Thompson has made one of the creepiest documentaries of the year that lingers in the mind long after the film has ended. He‚Äôs approached the well-known subject of Jeffrey Dahmer in a new and inventive way that managed to completely unnerve us.\\" The film was released theatrically and on Video On Demand through IFC on February 15, 2013, followed by a DVD release. The film was later released through Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and Google Play. The film was shot in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on Super 16 mm film over the course of three years. It was executive produced by Chris Smith (director of American Movie), Barry Poltermann, and Jack Turner. Plot synopsis In 1991, Jeffrey Dahmer was arrested in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and sentenced to 957 years in prison for murdering 17 men and boys and dismembering their bodies. Jeff explores the city of Milwaukee by meeting those surrounding Dahmer during and after his hidden spree. Recollections from Milwaukee Medical Examiner Jeffrey Jentzen, Police Detective Patrick Kennedy, and neighbor Pamela Bass are interwoven with archival footage and everyday scenes from Dahmer‚Äôs life, working collectively to disassemble the facade of an ordinary man leading an ordinary existence. Critical response The film received generally positive reviews, many of them praising the director's restraint. Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times called the film \\"a meditation on perversion as hypnotic as it is repulsive\\" and labeled it a \\"Critics' Pick\\". Mark Olson of the Los Angeles Times called the film \\"quietly unnerving.\\" John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter said that ‚ÄúJeff stands apart from the true-crime pack\\" and called Swant‚Äôs portrayal of Dahmer \\"eerily convincing.‚Äù John Gholson of Movies.com said ‚ÄúI‚Äôd go so far as to say that Jeff is one of the greatest serial killer movies ever made.‚Äù Owen Gleiberman, writing for Entertainment Weekly, said the film was \\"for hardcore Dahmer obsessives only.

These advances include: An approach that specifically addresses a 'hard-to-treat' or resistant client; A scientific understanding that supports a process for 'spontaneous change'; Unifying behavioral, cognitive, and psychodynamic orientations under a single umbrella theory; A science-based model showing how treating secondary non-criminogenic behaviors (i.e.: anger, low self-esteem, poor social skills, etc.) will impact primary targeted (volatile) criminogenic behaviors (i.e.: violence, problem sexual behavior (PSB), fire setting, etc.) In addition, paradox psychology 'solves the mystery' regarding the counter-intuitive nature of paradoxical interventions. In doing so, the approach represents the logical extension of attachment theory as described by Bowlby and Ainsworth. While there are many treatment theories that address separate aspects of behavior, emotions, and thinking, this approach focuses on the obvious fact that human's entire existence is a 'living paradox'. This paradox is evidenced by the fact that we live in an animal body, but we walk upright with our 'mind in the clouds'; our DNA is programmed to function via instinct, yet we prefer to assert free-will; we are smart enough to 'know better', but quite often repeat past mistakes. As such, it could be argued that the study of 'man as a paradox' is most closely aligned with our 'essence' as a human being. Master therapists While the paradoxical method was documented by Adler as early as the 1920s, its counter- intuitive style has always been difficult to explain. Adler once described the method as \\"spitting in the patient's soup\\"; meaning that the method had the ability to impact behavior without 'convincing or rewarding' the patient to change. From the 1960s through the 1980s many 'master therapists' incorporated the method with great success. They include: Milton Erickson, Viktor Frankl, Jay Haley, Salvador Minuchin, Fritz Perls, and others. The method proved to have a consistent ability (as described by many for) 'amazing results' with clients who presented a wide range of disruptive behavioral issues. Research Unbiased research indicates that behavioral, cognitive, and psychodynamic methods show success rates that are statistically equal when working with motivated clients. Paradoxical interventions were shown to have the highest success rate with oppositional and treatment-resistant clients.Sheras, P. L. & Jackson, S. R.

Journal of Counseling Psychology, 37, 363-370Beuter, Moleiro, & Talebi (2002) Resistance in Psychotherapy: What conclusions are supported by research, Journal of Clinical Psychology, 58 (2), 207-217 Scientific and evidenced based Even though the method was documented to be successful when working with treatment-resistance, paradoxical interventions lost favor in the late 1980s and '90s. This was due to the fact that the psychology field desired to present itself as science oriented, and pushed for 'evidence based' approaches. Since the underlying theory and mechanism for the paradoxical approach had remained an 'unsolved mystery', there was no way to promote the method in a concise and logical manner. However, more recently, Eliot P. Kaplan, PhD has been able to provide a simple scientific framework that provides a grounded understanding for this seemingly complicated approach. In his work treating adolescents with problem sexual behaviors (PSB), he has been able to show that a basic orbits-gravity model allows us to unravel the puzzling nature of the approach. The model identifies the process between repetitive energy / behavior (orbits) and the strength of attachment (force of gravity) as gauged through the therapeutic alliance. The model incorporates this scientific construct to identify the 'active ingredient' that allows the method to be consistently effective in disarming and bypassing treatment resistance. An exciting aspect of the approach is the humor and absurd quality of counter-intuitive interventions. It is often this unexpected humor that 'breaks-through' the client's usual attempts to keep the clinician at a distance and defend against treatment. Some of the better known interventions include: Prescribing the symptom; predicting behavior and outcomes; exaggerating symptomatic behavior; symptom planning and scheduling, etc. Reverse psychology Those who lack knowledge as to the depth of paradoxical interventions have tended to dismiss the approach simply as reverse psychology. While a paradoxical intervention and reverse psychology may seem similar on the surface, their underlying intent and direction are very different. In reverse psychology the clinician hopes to manipulate the client to follow his planned and preset agenda. (He tells the client to 'go left' with the 'plan' the client will resist his directive and 'go right'.) However, a 'pure' paradoxical intervention seeks to only strengthen the alliance without an ulterior motive. This is done with the understanding, that by 'shifting gravity-attachment' the client will spontaneously make changes of his own desire and free-will. (Here the clinician expresses unconditional positive regard. He acknowledges that the client's habitual pattern is to 'go left', and truly accepts that the client will most likely do this pattern in the near future. However, paradoxically now that the client's behavior has been predicted and the future outcome has been accepted, the client is in a position to make a 'free-will choice' to undo the forecasted behavior.) The difference here is that paradoxical interventions support the client's ability to take responsibility for his own actions, while reverse psychology focuses on the ability of the clinician to 'trick' the client ‚Äì a subtle but important difference. The advantage of the method is the ability to approach the client in a non-confrontational and non-threatening manner in such a way that it 'forces' the treatment-resistant client to take responsibility for his habitual reactions and patterns. Paradoxical interventions should not be used to directly target dangerous or criminogenic behaviors. In such situations clinicians need to use strategic interventions that target secondary non- criminogenic behaviors, but as a result will impact primary targeted volatile behavior.

Today a part of the Gisborne Region, the county was constituted on 10 December 1918. The area had previously been a part of Cook County, and became a part of the county again when the two councils were amalgamated on 1 April 1964. History Uawa County (constituted on 10 December 1918) made two attempts to secede from Cook County: in 1885 (with Waimata and Waiapu) and in 1909, when a separate county (Takirau County) was proposed. Although taxpayers had complained about the lack of infrastructure, a proposal to raise NZ¬£25,000 for roads and bridges was rejected in October 1910 by the slender margin of votes below the required three-fifths majority. The first council comprised: *Arakihi Riding: C. E. Smith, J. A. Moore and D. H. Hawkins *Tauwhareparae: F. Hutchinson and J. McNeil *Hauiti: E. B. Boland *Mangatuna: J. S. Paterson At the first meeting on May 12, 1919, Boland was elected chairman. One of the council's earliest decisions was that the county should secede from Gisborne Harbour District. A flat-bottomed boat was used to carry passengers across the Uawa River. Cattle from stations on their way to Gisborne were swum over, with residents who owned boats assisting. In 1883 a cable ferry, attached to an overhead cable and operated by a windlass was begun with W. Lockwood Sr. in charge. Between 1885 and 1893 the ferryman was Enoch Kirk, who was credited with ferrying 2,400 sheep in four hours. The ferry could carry a coach and five horses. At first, a whaleboat was used for passengers and light cargo at Tolaga Bay under the direction of Lockwood, J. A. Moore, H. Glover and W. E. Holder. Oil launches were later used. The first bridge over the Uawa River was built in 1905 at a cost of ¬£6,000. For two years, toll charges were levied (sixpence per person and a shilling for each horse), with W. E. Holder the first custodian. On 12 May 1916, a flood‚Äîthe first of thirteen in twelve months‚Äîcaused a portion of the bridge to subside. Two more bridges were destroyed during a flood in January 1917. Another flood on 4 February 1917 (when of rain fell in 18 hours) did further damage. So great was the rush of water that a bank over high formed at the mouth of the river. Until a new bridge was built, ferry service resumed. Another bridge was washed away by a flood in February 1938; however, a concrete bridge had just been completed and it was opened for traffic within 12 hours. When the county was established, the coastal road between Gisborne and Tolaga Bay and a new bridge over the Pakarae River were under construction. In 1922, taxpayers approved a ¬£104,000 bond for road and bridge construction (including the metalling of the Uawa portion of the Gisborne-Tolaga Bay highway and improvements to the section linking Uawa and Waiapu). A crushing plant was installed at Mangatuna, and a fleet of five trucks acquired. Local officials included: ;Chairmen: *E. B. Boland (1919‚Äì30) *J. McNeil (1930‚Äì43) *H. R. Irving (1943‚Äìunknown) ;Engineers: *J. P. Guthrie (1919‚Äì30) *G. W. King (1930‚Äì38) *C. Percy (1939‚Äìunknown) ;County clerks: *F. T. Robinson (1919‚Äì24) *H. L. Tempest (1924‚Äì47) *A. B. Smith (1947‚Äì48) *R. Tregurtha (1948‚Äìunknown) Early settlers Andrew Reeves (born at Moffatt, Dumfriesshire in 1832) reached Wellington in 1857, bought a horse and rode to the Hawke's Bay region. There, he was a manager for Purvis Russell and in 1863 bought a property near Wairoa. Reeves and his wife went to Tolaga Bay in December 1865, and were the first Europeans to settle there permanently. For many years, Reeves leased a total of . He had trouble obtaining title to Wharekaka, but his rights were upheld in court. Reeves was long the only Justice of the Peace at Tolaga Bay, and held a seat on the Cook County council for several terms. He died on 5 November 1903. For her service in the early days treating the sick, Margaret (Granny) Lockwood of Tolaga Bay was long remembered by many east-coast families. She attended cases from Pakarae to Waipiro Bay, and her skills as a midwife were renowned. A daughter of Robert Espie and Ani Umutopua, Lockwood was born at Mawhai in 1839. Her first husband was Abraham Moore of Auckland. After his death she married his partner, William Lockwood (born in Rhode Island), and in 1875 they moved to Tolaga Bay. Granny Lockwood died on 15 December 1932, leaving over 100 descendants. Captain William Henry Glover (called \\"Karawa\\" by the MƒÅori) was born in Newcastle upon Tyne. Before settling at Tolaga Bay in 1855, he had a store at Waipare. He was the district's first sheep farmer (1864) and its first publican (1866). His daughter Lucy married Edward Robson, who held a seat on the Cook County council for several years. His son Henry (1857‚Äì1942) was a noted boatman. Captain Glover died on 24 November 1881. Edward Murphy (born 1845 at St. Kilda, Victoria) obtained a lease of Paremata (Tolaga Bay) in 1873 and was appointed a Justice of the Peace at that time. With his family, he returned to Australia in 1882; in 1884, he returned and settled in Panikau (then undeveloped), making his home at Manutuke. In 1891, Murphy became an original lessees of Tauwhareparae. For a number of years, he served on the Cook County Council. Among Murphy's gifts was the Bethany (Edward Murphy Memorial) Hospital at Gisborne, which was opened on 14 December 1920. He died in Auckland on 27 June 1919. Henry Williams (born in Wales in 1845) migrated with his parents to Australia in 1853. He came to Wellington in 1865, and was apprenticed in the tannery business. In 1875 Williams moved to Poverty Bay, where he was a shopkeeper and butcher. Four years later he moved to Tolaga Bay, settling about seven miles upriver and opening a general store and butcher shop with a partner (J. Morris). In the early 1880s he acquired Taumatarata, which was then undeveloped. He added Waiomoko to this holding, and named his entire property Waiomoko. Williams moved to Gisborne in 1912, and died on 26 October 1934. Edward Brabazon Boland began his public service in 1907, when he was elected to represent the Tolaga Bay riding on the Cook County council. He was the first chairman of the Uawa County Council and the Tolaga Bay Harbour Board. Michael (Micky) Mullooly lived in Tolaga Bay. Born in Ireland in 1836, he tried his luck in the Ballarat gold fields and at Gabriel's Gully. Mullooly served in the East Cape War, and was a guard on the Chatham Islands when Te Kooti and his group escaped. In 1873 he opened the Sea View Hotel at Tolaga Bay, providing his guests with simple, adequate accommodation. One morning a guest complained that his boots were not cleaned, although he left them outside his bedroom door. Mullooly could hardly believe that anyone would have taken the risk of losing his footgear. ‚ÄúYou are very lucky,‚Äù he told him, ‚Äúthat you found them there in the morning!‚Äù What he had in mind was that some of his patrons were noted for their light-fingered habits. Mullooly was described as ‚Äúa little man who revelled in litigation, but was apt to grasp at the shadow and lose the substance.‚Äù His guests could depend on being regaled with his version of his latest battle in the courts. Mullooly died on 13 June 1912. 1875 to 1945 The site of Tolaga Bay township was bought by the Crown on 10 March 1875 for ¬£505. At the time, it was covered with gorse. In 1904, the name \\"Buckley\\" (after Sir Patrick Buckley, colonial secretary in the Seddon cabinet) was given to the township; however, residents continued to use the name \\"Tolaga Bay\\" (which Captain James Cook gave to the adjacent inlet). Major roads bear names commemorating the navigator's visit. With 52 European residents (and the same number in the surrounding area), Tolaga Bay was the largest European settlement on the east coast in 1875. The 1926 population of Uawa County in 1926 was Europeans, 1,074 and Maoris, 592. In 1945 there were 749 Europeans and 754 Maoris, with an additional 3 percent absent due to the war. The gross capital value of the county in 1945 was ¬£1,257,536. A tragedy occurred on 11 June 1887, when Mrs. Enoch Kirk and three of her children were being brought ashore from the SS Australia. Harry Glover was in charge of the surfboat, with Rawiri and Ropihana Tautau and Harry Hiutau the crew. Inside the shoal, the boat was capsized by a wave. Glover got Mrs. Kirk ashore, but she died; Rawiri Tautau survived. A boat, manned by Constable M. G. Stagpoole, Joe James and Sam Gilman, attempted to rescue the others but also capsized; Gilman swam ashore. The constable lashed Hiutau to his upturned boat, and they were picked up by a boat sent from the Australia. In addition to Mrs. Kirk and her children‚ÄîNellie (age nine), Ralph (age two) and Maud (age one)‚ÄîJoe James and Ropihana Tautau also died. Stagpoole was awarded a silver medal by the Royal Humane Society of Australasia. On 25 January 1923 taxpayers in the Tolaga Bay harbour district, by a vote of 115‚Äì22, authorised a bond not exceeding ¬£100,000 for a reinforced concrete wharf area for coastal vessels. The wharf and jetty are long, and their depth at low tide is . The first harbourmaster was J. M. Fraser.

Mobile application testing can be an automated or manual type of testing. Mobile applications either come pre-installed or can be installed from mobile software distribution platforms. Global mobile app revenues totaled 69.7 billion USD in 2015, and are predicted to account for US$188.9 billion by 2020. Bluetooth, GPS, sensors, and Wi-Fi are some of the core technologies at play in wearables. Mobile application testing accordingly focuses on field testing, user focus, and looking at areas where hardware and software need to be tested in unison. Key challenges for mobile application testing * Must be downloadable: The application must be obtainable for the particular platform, generally from an app store. * Diversity in mobile platforms/OSes:There are different mobile operating systems in the market. The major ones are Android, iOS, and Windows Phone. Each operating system has its own limitations. * Device availability: Access to the right set of devices when there is an ever-growing list of devices and operating system versions is a constant mobile application testing challenge. Access to devices can become even more challenging if testers are spread across different locations. * Mobile network operators: There are over 400 mobile network operators in the world; some are CDMA, some GSM, and others use less common network standards like FOMA, and TD-SCDMA. * Scripting: The variety of devices makes executing a test script (scripting) a key challenge. As devices differ in keystrokes, input methods, menu structure and display properties single script does not function on every device. * Test method: There are two main ways of testing mobile applications: testing on real devices or testing on emulators. Emulators often miss issues that can only be caught by testing on real devices, but because of the multitude of different devices in the market, real devices can be expensive to purchase and time-consuming to use for testing. * Compatibility: It is necessary to test the compatibility; suppose an application can work on the high resolution and it doesn't work on the lower resolution. * Should be able to pick up the phone: While executing the app application should be able to pick up a call. * Variety of mobile devices: Mobile devices differ in screen input methods (QWERTY, touch, normal) with different hardware capabilities. Types of mobile application testing * Functional testing ensures that the application is working as per the requirements. Most of the tests conducted for this is driven by the user interface and call flow. * Laboratory testing, usually carried out by network carriers, is done by simulating the complete wireless network. This test is performed to find out any glitches when a mobile application uses voice and/or data connection to perform some functions. * Performance testing is undertaken to check the performance and behavior of the application under certain conditions such as low battery, bad network coverage, low available memory, simultaneous access to the application's server by several users and other conditions. Performance of an application can be affected from two sides: the application's server side and client's side. Performance testing is carried out to check both. * Memory leakage testing: Memory leakage happens when a computer program or application is unable to manage the memory it is allocated resulting in poor performance of the application and the overall slowdown of the system. As mobile devices have significant constraints of available memory, memory leakage testing is crucial for the proper functioning of an application * Interrupt testing: An application while functioning may face several interruptions like incoming calls or network coverage outage and recovery. The different types of interruptions are: :* Incoming and outgoing SMS and MMS :* Incoming and outgoing calls :* Incoming notifications :* Battery removal :* Cable insertion and removal for data transfer :* Network outage and recovery :* Media player on/off :* Device power cycle :An application should be able to handle these interruptions by going into a suspended state and resuming afterwards. * Usability testing is carried out to verify if the application is achieving its goals and getting a favorable response from users. This is important as the usability of an application is its key to commercial success (it is nothing but user friendliness). Another important part of usability testing is to make sure that the user experience is uniform across all devices. This section of testing hopes to address the key challenges of the variety of mobile devices and the diversity in mobile platforms/OS, which is also called device fragmentation. One key portion of this type of usability testing is to be sure that there are no major errors in the functionality, placement, or sizing of the user interface on different devices. * Installation testing: Certain mobile applications come pre- installed on the device whereas others have to be installed by the store. Installation testing verifies that the installation process goes smoothly without the user having to face any difficulty. This testing process covers installation, updating and uninstalling of an application * Certification testing: To get a certificate of compliance, each mobile device needs to be tested against the guidelines set by different mobile platforms. * Security testing checks for vulnerabilities to hacking, authentication and authorization policies, data security, session management and other security standards. * Location testing: Connectivity changes with network and location, but you can't mimic those fluctuating conditions in a lab. Only in Country non-automated testers can perform comprehensive usability and functionality testing. * Outdated software testing: Not everyone regularly updates their operating system. Some Android users might not even have access to the newest version. Professional testers can test outdated software. * Load testing: When many users all attempt to download, load, and use an app or game simultaneously, slow load times or crashes can occur causing many customers to abandon your app, game, or website. In-country human testing done manually is the most effective way to test load. * Black box testing doesn't include the internally coding logic of the application. The tester tests the application with functionality without peering with internally structure of the application. This method of test can be applied virtually to every level of software testing: unit, integration, system and acceptance. * Crowdsourced testing: In recent years, crowdsourced testing has become popular as companies can test mobile applications faster and cheaper using a global community of testers. Due to growing diversity of devices and operating systems as well as localization needs, it is difficult to comprehensively test mobile applications with small in-house testing teams. A global community of testers provides easy access to different devices and platforms. A globally distributed team can also test it in multiple locations and under different network conditions. Finally, localization issues can be tested by hiring testers in required geographies. Since real users using real devices test the application, this is more likely to find issues faced by users under real world conditions.

Severe Setbacks at Outset NB: This section is derived from text in available here at the New Zealand Electronic Text Centre. Matakaoa County was formed in 1919, and the first council meeting was held on 22 May 1920. George Kirk (chairman of Waiapu County) was appointed chairman. His associates were: C. I. B. Beckett, K. F. Reed, W. F. Metcalfe, A. E. Kemp, W. Walker, R. T. Kohere, H. McClutchie and A. L. Allan. The first clerk was A. Whitehead (later a Judge of the Native Land Court). Mr. Metcalfe succeeded Mr. Kirk as chairman in 1921, and, five years later, Mr. Reed took over the position. Upon Mr. Reed's death in 1929 Mr. Kemp became chairman. In 1921 D. J. McNaught was appointed clerk. Early in its career the county suffered heavy setbacks. It assumed a liability of NZ¬£15,000 (being part of the Waiapu County's main road and bridges loan) and another of ¬£1,200 in connection with the Te Araroa jetty. Anticipating that the wharfage dues that would be provided by a freezing works that had just been built at Hicks Bay would meet the loan charges, it borrowed ¬£30,000 and built a wharf there. However, the works was closed after the 1925‚Äì6 season. By then, the county had also raised several small loans for road works. The county's revenue was further adversely affected during the depression in the late 1920s and early 1930s. 40% of the county had not left the natives' hands, and only 20% was European freehold. As many of the residents were unable to meet their rating obligations, the council, in 1932, sought guidance from the Government. On 1 May 1933, the county was placed under C. H. Bull, of Gisborne, as commissioner, but the council was retained as a consultative body. Upon Mr. Bull's death in 1944 D. E. Chrisp, Gisborne, became commissioner, and, in 1946, his term was extended until 1950. The capital value of the county in 1946 was ¬£586,298, compared with ¬£1,045,712 in 1920. In 1878 there were 9 Europeans at Horoera, 6 at Te Araroa, and 3 at Matakaoa. The European population of the county in 1926 was 539 and the natives numbered 963. In 1945 the figures were 303 and 1,547 respectively, plus 3% as an allowance for residents away on war service. Biographical information NB: This section is derived from text in available here at the New Zealand Electronic Text Centre. Dr. Tutere Wi Repa (born at Pahaoa, Bay of Plenty) was a son of Ropiha Wi Repa and Ropata Wahawaha. He was educated at Te Kaha Native School and Te Aute College. A scholarship enabled him to enter the Medical School at Otago University. With Sir Peter Buck, a fellow-student, he shared pioneer Maori honours in graduating for the medical profession. He represented Te Aute, Otago University and Poverty Bay at Rugby and was prominent in tennis and other sports. Not only was he an excellent debater, but he was also a gifted writer on Maori history, customs and problems. After practising in the Dunedin Hospital and at Gisborne he moved to Te Araroa, where he ministered to the needs of widely scattered native communities, and where many of his well- earned fees could never be collected.

As a senior partner of Fowell, Mansfield and Maclurcan (and from 1971, Fowell, Mansfield, Jarvis and Maclurcan), he designed or directed the design of a wide range of building types, from individual houses to important infrastructure projects. Early years He was the eldest son of Winifred Kenna and Charles Dansie Maclurcan.http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=950087 His grandmother, Hannah Maclurcan, was the author of \\"Mrs. Maclurcan's Cookbook\\" and owned the Wentworth Hotel. Charles Maclurcan (1889-1957) was an electrical engineer and he used the flat roof of the Wentworth Hotel for his pioneering experiments in wireless transmission. Donald Maclurcan was educated at OLSH in Bowral, New South Wales and at Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview, where he completed his education in 1936. With the exception of English, his academic record was ordinary, despite his intelligence: he simply was not interested. His school books were strewn with drawings and at the early age of 12 he declared that he wanted to be an architect. His most memorable achievement at school in fact was the notoriety he attracted when, with two friends, he hung a dummy in 1934 over the newly completed Sydney Harbour Bridge which prank garnered news paper coverage. Expulsion was avoided due to the intervention of one Jesuit father who liked him. Wartime After leaving school, he attended the Sydney Institute of Technology in Ultimo to study architecture. In 1938, he met his future wife, Margaret Davis. In 1939, he enlisted in the Militia as a despatch rider and whilst unofficially engaged to Margaret, any thought of marriage was placed in abeyance. In 1941, he joined the AIF as a Sapper Second Lieutenant and departed for the Middle East on the Queen Mary in September. On his return in March, 1942, he married Margaret at St. Mary's Cathedral, during 10 days leave. He then departed for New Guinea soon becoming a Captain in the 2nd/14th Field Company. In New Guinea, he worked in Port Moresby then walked from Kokoda to Soputa, supervising the maintenance of the roads and bridges whilst being bombed by the Japanese. In 1944, he returned to Australia and collapsed on the Parade ground with malaria, weighing less than 7 stone. Invalided out of the army just when he was to be promoted to Major, he resumed his studies with great energy, completing the final 18 months of the course in 6 months. In doing so, he developed an ulcer. Architectural career After graduation, he joined the architectural firm of \\"FowellJoseph Charles Fowell and Mansfieldhttp://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/mansfield-john-leslie-stephen-11054\\" becoming a named partner in June 1946. As a senior partner for 30 years he designed and/or directed the design of a wide range of building types, from individual houses to important infrastructure projects. He developed special expertise in the aesthetics of civil engineering structures and matters concerning visual environment. As a result, he directed the firm's many consultancies to government authorities such as the Snowy Mountains Engineering Authority, the NSW Departments of Main Roads and Railways, the State Electricity Commission and the Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board. He was Chairman of the National Parks Advisory Committee of Architects (1966 to 1976), a member of the NSW State Pollution Control Commission and the Australian Government's Advisory Committee for Expo 74, held in Spokane, USA. He travelled extensively in Europe in 1952 on general architecture studies, in 1960 to the USA on major dams and power stations and in 1967 to both Europe and USA researching road bridges, expressway interchanges and underground rail systems. Other achievements He was also President of the Illuminating Engineers (NSW then Australia)http://www.iesanz.org/about/history/ in 1952, a member of the Catholic Building and Finance Committee and the first Chairman of the newly formed Zoological Parks Board of NSW from 1973 to 1976, in which capacity he visited major zoos around the world in 1973 to study their design and administration. In 1975, in recognition of these achievements, he was appointed an OBE. Some years earlier, he was recognised by the Catholic Church for his advisory work by being appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Gregory. Throughout his career, he also pursued other activities with the same determination he applied to his work.

At the same time, he owned a succession of sports cars, including 4 Bristols, an Aston Martin, MGs, and a Riley. He drove them all like there was no tomorrow and maintained many of them himself, applying his significant mechanical skills. As a young boy, he sailed with his brothers, Douglas and Robert, in a small vessel off Pittwater. This was the start of his other major sporting interest. In 1959, he purchased the 28 foot Daydream, \\"Mirrabooka\\" and immediately began competitive racing. He graduated to the 31 foot \\"Mhairi Dhu\\" in 1962, then launched the 34 foot \\"Morag Bheag\\" in 1969. He continued to race until 1990 culminating with the recognition of \\"Yachtsman of the Year\\" at the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron Annual Prize Giving. He sailed with fierce skill, loved to win but was always generous in his acknowledgment of the skill of his competitor if he was beaten. Retirement In 1983, he retired at the age of 65 and thereafter would say he \\"used\\" to be an architect, filling his time making exquisite ship models. All of his attention to detail, dexterity and love of the sea came into play and for the next 10 years he produced about 15 models. In 1987, he was commissioned to build a model of the Endeavour for the Bi-Centenary, which is now in the National Museum in Canberra.http://www.nma.gov.au/collections-search/display?irn=27894 He was delighted to receive a tax credit in lieu of payment. When he was approached to apply his skills to commercial model making, his sense of fairness prevailed and he refused, saying that the work should be directed to those who built models for a living, not a retired gentleman like himself. He was also an accomplished painter and a few privileged friends were given beautiful water colours of their yachts, painted by him in his annual Christmas sojourn to Pittwater on the family yacht. He remained married to Margaret for 57 years until his death in 1999 and they had 4 children; Charles, Lyndal, Barbara and John.

This term was used by Candace West and Don Zimmerman in their article \\"Doing Gender\\", published in 1987 in Gender and Society. According to this paper, an individual's performance of gender is intended to construct gendered behavior as naturally occurring. This fa√ßade furthers a system through which individuals are judged in terms of their failure or success to meet gendered societal expectations, called the accountability structure. The concept of doing gender was later expanded by authors such as West and Fenstermaker in the book Doing Gender, Doing Difference. Concept The concept of \\"doing\\" gender came from conversations of gender from sociology and gender studies. The specific term \\"doing gender\\" was used in West and Zimmerman's article by the same title, originally written in 1977 but not published until 1987. West and Zimmerman illustrate that gender is performed in interactions, and that behaviors are assessed based on socially accepted conceptions of gender. Rather than focusing on how gender is ingrained in the individual or perpetuated by institutions, West and Zimmerman emphasize the interactional level as a site where gender is invoked and reinforced. They begin by differentiating sex from sex category and gender. In this piece, sex is the socially agreed upon criteria for being male or female, usually based on and individual's genitalia at birth or chromosomal typing before birth. Sex category is the assumed biological category, regardless of the individual's gender identification. This is \\"established and sustained by the socially required identificatory displays that proclaim one's membership in one or the other category\\". Gender, in this context, is the degree to which an actor is masculine or feminine, in light of societal expectations about what is appropriate for one's sex category. Doing gender according to West and Zimmerman \\"is to advance a new understanding of gender as a routine accomplishment embedded in every day interaction\\". Essentially, West and Zimmerman argued that gender is something that humans created. As humans, we have categorized and defined many aspects of life. If someone was not in favor of their gender role or did something that was not deemed \\"correct\\" for that gender this person would be committing an act of social deviance. Gender is described as 'omnirelevant,' as it is apparent and relevant in almost every interaction. In their article, West and Zimmerman use examples such as bathrooms, sports, coupling, conversations, professions and the might have been division of labor to illustrate the ways in which gender is prevalent in many taken for granted activities. West and Zimmerman employ the example of a professional woman in a male-dominated field, through which it becomes apparent that the woman will have to make decisions as to whether or not she should engage in \\"unfeminine\\" behavior that would otherwise be an integral part of her identity. Another component of this theory is gendered assessment of behavior. In the above example, the woman is engaging in behavior that will be assessed as either masculine or feminine by her co-workers. According to West and Zimmerman, this woman will be evaluated based on how her actions compare to accountability standards of the sex category she belongs to. Deviations from these expectations do not have an immediate effect on the accountability structure itself. Instead, failures to meet these standards are attributed to the individual rather than to the rigidity of recognized categories. With this theory, West and Zimmerman stress the importance of social interaction in maintaining the gender structure. Because individuals \\"do\\" and assess gender in interaction, gender is visible in a wide variety of activities such as conversation. Foundations The idea that gender is something that individuals actively 'do' was largely inspired by the social psychological approach taken by Erving Goffman (1976) in Gender Display.(p. 129) Goffman theorizes that humans make the assumption that each has an \\"essential nature,\\" which can be interpreted by reading \\"natural signs given off or expressed by them\\" (p. 75). One of the most basic natures that can be assumed from interpreting these signs is one's masculinity or femininity. Not only is gender often determined by others relatively easily, but this determination often establishes the ways in which individuals interact with one another. Goffman asserts that, because we habitually function within such scripts, they are taken to be further evidence of essential natures. He coins the term \\"gender display\\" as a way to conceptualize the ways in which individuals act in a gender appropriate manner. However, these performances are optional and vulnerable to disturbance, as inappropriate gender display can just as easily be invoked as socially accepted ones. Goffman asserts that there is a \\"scheduling\\" of gender displays around activities, so that the activities themselves are not interrupted by gender displays. For instance, colleagues may interact in a gendered manner during their lunch hour, rather than while they are working together on a project. West and Zimmerman take issue with this piece of Goffman's perspective, claiming that this masks the ways in which gender displays permeate nearly all social situations in that individuals cannot avoid being interpreted as masculine or feminine.  In the media  Media has a powerful influence over many aspects of modern life. The way gender is expressed and perceived by audiences varies from culture to culture. The language within a culture as \\"the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis [states], notes how language influences our perceptions and thus shapes our reality.\\" As language evolves within a culture and new language is added, the gender identities are influenced and categories change. The influence of language and the significance it has often communicated over media and the gender categories people use to place gender roles in, may change or add new categories. There are other areas that gender roles and differences stem from, \\"some researchers suggest that gender differences result from a variety of factors including socialization and biology‚Ä¶gender roles are often manifested through communication and culture (Goffman, 1976; Lauzen et al., 2008; Wanta & Legett, 1989; Williams & Best, 1990; Wood, 2009).\\" Gender is something that is always out there whether we are mindful of it or not: \\"Gender identity and gender roles are a significant part of everyday life.\\" On top of this, gender roles help us make sense of our environment, they influence relationships and our own views. Since the social aspect of life is such an essential part and needs to be fulfilled, we are exposed to gender roles frequently and sometimes unconsciously, absorbing it if it fits with the category that society has influenced us to perceive it as. \\"In contemporary media and culture, women's and men's social desirability and gender often been defined in terms of their bodies. For women this has often involved comparing themselves to and even replicating the 'thin ideal'.\\" These views like the 'thin ideal' are reinforced through media with advertising, actors, and Photoshop touchups. On the other end, men have been shown images of being extremely fit and muscular, usually in a pose that expresses power, and the cultures values of what 'masculinity' is for a culture. \\"Gender-based definitions of success frequently revolve around presenting or developing their bodies as strong, youthful, active and physically dominant.\\" These roles are promoted by society, with visual displays and traits assigned to specific gender roles. \\"Goffman (1976) accounts for these traits in his research of magazine and newspaper photography, finding women to be pictured in more submissive positions while men are depicted in more elevated positions.\\" These depictions of gender are growing in certain trending shows and movies. Lauzen and colleagues (2008) examined gender roles in television, \\"they found male characters on prime time television were more likely to inhabit work roles, including blue collar, white collar, and extracurricular activities, while women were portrayed in more interpersonal roles involving romance, friendship, and family.\\" The way gender roles are portrayed in TV can spill into everyday life. Another area that 'doing gender' is being expressed is in video games: \\"Female characters are represented as highly sexualized while male characters possess exaggerated strength, are hyper masculine, aggressive, and, with the exception of showing hostility, lack emotion.\\" The way gender roles are represented in video games adds another influence that society has to take in and this can make people think that these fictional depictions can be obtained. This then creates perspectives used to categorize gender roles and as we see others 'doing gender' we want to believe that we should be looking like these characters in games or actors in advertisements and T.V. \\"A number of studies, for example, have demonstrated extensive 'gender-swapping' in 'avatar' creation for online gaming and in text based CMC.\\" The increase in video games and in especially online environments allow people to step into other gender roles, by 'doing gender' that may be different in how they present themselves in real life. These online environments allow users to shape their roles in gender. =Social media and dating = The rise of social media networks allows people to communicate globally and manage how others perceive them and how they choose to express their gender. The increase of digital content in today's technology has influences over gender roles, \\"Digital formats‚Ä¶represent exciting possibilities for individuals who can explore the freedom of presenting a physical self that might differ from the one they present or perform in everyday life or form socially-defines expectations.\\" People will put themselves into a role to look as though they fit in and to avoid embarrassment in case they violate a social norm. Responses and critiques Judith Butler has written extensively on this topic, using the term \\"gender performativity\\". She explains the same idea of doing gender by explaining gender as a set of performative actions that people learn and attempt to recreate through actions and presentation. The concept of doing gender has been critiqued by scholars who assert that it does not take human agency and acts of resistance into account. In order to illustrate the possibility of change, several works have been published in which researchers claim to document an 'undoing' or 'redoing' of gender. Francine M. Deutsch, in \\"Undoing Gender\\" (2007), examines how the concept of doing gender has been employed in research. Deutsch uses examples of studies that use West and Zimmerman's work to illustrate how normative gender ideals are apparent in a variety of contexts. This, she argues, contributes to the invisibility of gender transgression and does not work towards West and Zimmerman's goal of eliminating gender inequity. In order to facilitate the undoing of gender, Deutsch suggests that \\"The study of the interactional level could expand beyond simply documenting the persistence of inequality to examine (1) when and how social interactions become less gendered, not just differently gendered; (2) the conditions under which gender is irrelevant in social interactions; (3) whether all gendered interactions reinforce inequality; (4) how the structural (institutional) and interactional levels might work together to produce change; and (5) interaction as the site of change\\" (p. 114). By focusing on these areas, Deutsch asserts, it is easier to find practical solutions to problems cause by gender inequity. Catherine Connell (2010) presented the idea of \\"redoing gender\\" as well as \\"doing transgender\\" in her work, \\"Doing, Undoing or Redoing Gender?: Learning from the Workplace Experiences of Transpeople\\". Connell posits that transpeople may redo gender by altering normative ideas of gender in their interactions, but may simultaneously participate in the doing of gender in other ways. Connell coins the term \\"doing transgender\\" in order to provide a way to examine how transpeople must make sense of the disconnect between sex, gender and sex category, which they may obscure or actively express in interactions. In January 2009, the academic journal Gender and Society published a West and Zimmerman Symposium, in honor of the concept of doing gender. Nine short articles were composed for the symposium, including a piece by West and Zimmerman. Several authors argued that the doing gender framework did not allow for agency, intent or consciousness. Other authors argued that biology needed to be focused on when considering doing gender, in order to understand what role the body plays in gender assessment. West and Zimmerman responded with an article titled \\"Accounting for Doing Gender\\", in which they restated their original argument, with an emphasis on accountability. In this, they argued, the doing gender framework does not hide agency, but contextualizes it. Because individuals' gender will be interpreted based on the accountability structure, the effectiveness of their resistance may not serve to \\"undo\\" gender. The authors contend that gender may be \\"redone\\" but never \\"undone\\", as accountability structures may change but gender will not disappear. The 'doing gender' framework, developed by West and Zimmerman, is highly influential in housework research.Brines, J. (1994). Economic dependency, gender, and the division of labor at home. American Journal of sociology, 100(3), 652-688.Greenstein, T. N. (2000). Economic dependence, gender, and the division of labor in the home: A replication and extension. Journal of Marriage and Family, 62(2), 322-335.Kolpashnikova, K. (2018). American househusbands: New time use evidence of gender display, 2003‚Äì2016. Social Indicators Research, 140(3), 1259-1277.  Doing difference  Doing difference is a concept that grew out of the authors' earlier idea of \\"doing gender\\", presented at the American Sociological Association in 1977 by Candace West and Don Zimmerman and published in Gender and Society in 1987. In 1995, Candace West and Sarah Fenstermaker sought to extend the idea of gender as an ongoing interactional process into the realms of race and class. They begin by asserting that the intersection of these three fundamental ways to categorize social difference cannot simply be thought of in a mathematical or even strictly hierarchical sense. That is, simply plugging in these concepts as variables in a multiple regression model to predict life success in a particular society provides a simplified way to look at their relative effects, but would fail to provide an adequate basis for even understanding, lesser yet altering systemic inequalities based on race, class, and gender. For instance, poor black women in the United States face immense social disadvantages, but to place them at the bottom of some abstract listing of vulnerable populations tells us little about how race, class, and gender interacted in their biography and social milieu to constrain and direct their lives. Their analysis of these core differences from the standpoint of ethnomethodology turns the focus away from individual characteristics. Instead, they are understood processually as \\"emergent properties of social situations\\" which simultaneously produce systematically different outcomes for social groups and the rationale for such disparities. The authors assert that the reason race and class were not adequately considered in earlier works is because the feminist movement has historically been the province of white middle class women in the developed world who were not sufficiently affected or attuned to the nature of these corollary oppressions. Furthermore, few women outside this privileged lot were able to gain access to institutions of higher education, which might have permitted them to engage in the academic discourse and activity about such shortcomings. Even if they had, the gatekeepers within the academy and at leading journals made this unlikely process even more difficult. Perhaps overt racism and classism (and sexism) is less apparent today in these institutions, but the tendency remains for those in positions of power to view the world in a way that discounts the experience of marginalized groups. The central theme of \\"difference\\" here is meant to illustrate how the concepts of race and gender have been falsely conceived as biologically bound predictors of behavior and aptitude among those who are a certain skin color or sex. The commonalities within these somewhat arbitrary categories often exaggerated and the behavior of the most dominant group within the category (e.g. rich white men or women) becomes idealized as the only appropriate way to fulfill one social role. This conceptualization is then employed as a means of excluding and stigmatizing those who do not or cannot live up to these standards. This process of \\"doing difference\\" is realized in constant interpersonal interactions that reaffirm and reproduce social structure. Experiencing the world through the interaction of these \\"essentialized\\" characteristics and especially through dominant group's frame of reference (power interests) produces a pattern of thought and behavior that reproduces these social inequalities. Social science research has rendered dubious any claim that race can simply be conflated with color, or gender with genitalia, or even class with paychecks. Class may not seem as prone to ideas about natural social differentiation, but within capitalist societies, it is often assumed that one's economic situation is a more or less direct indication of one's capacity to achieve. Since women and people of color taken are more often poor, natural disadvantage is at least tacitly assumed by many. Given the general observation that powerful groups seem to rely heavily on these ideas of natural subordination, many liberationist thinkers came to the conclusion that this essentialism would be a prime rhetorical vehicle to subvert. Thus, the deconstruction of role theory and functionalism within sociology was a central theme from the 1960s onward. This still left a somewhat gaping theoretical vacuum, one that continues to be felt by people struggling with this challenge to fundamentally alter their social cosmology. Social constructionism has assumed the major explanatory role in these discussions by positing that the meanings of these supposedly ascribed statuses are in fact situationally dependent on the sort of social context in which we employ them. That is, race, class, and gender aren't just objective scientific facts, but dynamic processes of culturally constructing cues for moral behavior (for which one can be held personally accountable) in a particular circumstance. It is these constantly occurring processes, not some divinely decreed grand plan, which reproduces social structure. Individuals \\"do difference\\" when they acknowledge (knowingly or unknowingly) how their categorization renders them socially accountable to acting in a particular way in a situation. However, when individuals recalibrate \\"doing difference\\" to produce alternative ways to conceptualize interaction patterns, it amounts to social change.

On 20 June 1264, Pope Urban IV ordered the chapter in Magdeburg to accept Eric as a canon, however, the chapter ignored this order. Later attempts to gain a foothold in the archbishopric were also unsuccessful. On 1 May 1272, archbishop Conrad II of Magdeburg created a defensive alliance with the Princes of Werle, Rugia and Mecklenburg, against the Margraves of Brandenburg. After Conrad II died in 1272, a split occurred in the cathedral chapter in Magdeburg. One party preferred Eric, who was supported by his brother Margrave Otto and his cousin Duke Albert of Brunswick. The other party preferred Canon Burchard of Querfurt. The two parties were at the brink of war when a settlement was reached: neither candidate was elected, instead the post was offered to G√ºnther I of Schwalenberg. Peace, however, did not last long. War soon broke out between the newly elected archbishop and Margrave Otto IV, who was defeated and captured in the Battle of Frohse on 10 January 1278. The feud against Magdeburg continued after his release. Eric was finally elected in 1283, after G√ºnther had abdicated in 1278 and his successor, Bernard of W√∂lpe, resigned in 1282. He only held the archbishop's chair for twelve years; however, this period turned out to be highly significant for the constitutional history of the city. There were many feuds early in his reign, and fighting them was expensive. The citizens of Magdeburg were initially unhappy with his election, because they viewed him as the brother of the bellicose Margrave; the city had often suffered hardships during his many wars. In 1284, Eric had to combat a revolt by ministeriales in his territory. He called in assistance from his brother. The revolt was quenched. However, Otto demanded he be compensated for the cost incurred, and Eric had to pledge Lusatia to him. His subjects changed their view of him when events began to unfold. When Eric was taken prisoner in 1284 during the siege of Harlingberg castle in the Duchy of Brunswick, the citizens of Magdeburg paid his ransom. Several years later, Eric concluded an alliance at the Diet in Erfurt with Bishop Siegfried II of Hildesheim and other princes to maintain the public peace in the area. When this alliance attacked Harlingberg again in 1291, they were successful and the castle was conquered and destroyed. The many feuds and the resultant financial difficulties gave the citizens of Magdeburg, who were struggling for greater independence, the opportunity to purchase several important privileges from the archbishop. In a deed dated 17 January 1292, he undertook to not use the property of the cathedral chapter or to citizens of Magdeburg to pay the cost of a feud. Instead, if war threatened, he would, with permission of the chapter and the citizens, levy a tax, which would not exceed the subject's ability to pay. In later years, the city acquired other important benefits. In 1293, the larger guilds objected the large influence the nobility had on the city government. After these guilds did well in the council elections, the council sought to shift power from the magistrates to the council. All sorts of allegations were made against the magistrates and it came to violent scenes between the magistrates and the council. The council impounded the book in which all land transfers were registered and demanded that it be kept under auspices of the Burding, the citizen's council, rather than under the auspices of the Burgrave's court and the Schulthei√ü. The key of the book was taken away from the magistrates. In the following year, the archbishop gave in to these demands. Duke Albert I of Saxony sold the post of Burgrave of Magdeburg for 900 Marks to Eric, who was reimbursed by the city. Eric undertook to enfeoff the same person with the posts of Burgrave and Schulthei√ü. Lay magistrates were to be selected by the city council and the five guild masters and their selection confirmed by the archbishop. Conveyancing would henceforth be done in the Burgrave's court. Later that year, the city also purchased the post of Schulthei√ü. Thus, the city council found itself in a significantly different position: they now needed to realize their newly gained powers vis-√†-vis the magistrates. In March 1295, the city council transferred jurisdiction of real estate and inheritance cases to the Burgrave's court, allowing the magistrates to focus on criminal offences. The magistrates objected to this transfer. The city council also used its privilege to select new magistrates, ignoring objections from the old magistrates who were still in office. Archbishop Eric did what he could to combat feuds and brigandage. He made some large donations to various religious institutions, in particular to Lehnin Abbey, where the Ascanian margraves were buried.

Its purpose is to conduct research in the history of both Italy and Germany, and investigate particularly the German- Italian relations in a wider international context from medieval times to the present day.http://www.dhi-roma.it/ueber_uns.html?&L;=24  Institute  The \\"Deutsche Historische Institut in Rom\\", short DHI Rome, was founded as \\"Prussian Historical Station\\" in 1888 after the opening of the Vatican Secret Archives. It conducts historical basic research, promotes young academics and is a services facility. As such, the DHI Rome supports German scientists and institutions in their relevant research and promotes the cooperation of German, Italian and international historians. In 1960 a Department of Music History was created at the institute, working on the musical cultures of Germany and Italy as well as their relationships in the music history of Europe. Traditionally, guests, scholarship recipients and research fellows of the German Historical Institute in Rome work in the Vatican Secret Archives and the Vatican Library. Since the 1960s, they focus increasingly on further church and state archives and libraries situated in Rome. The director sides with an Academic Advisory Board. The DHI Rome was included in the Max Weber Stiftung ‚Äì Deutsche Geisteswissenschaftliche Institute im Ausland (Max Weber Foundation ‚Äì German Humanities Institutes Abroad) (founded in 2002 in Bonn), together with further humanities institutes of the Federal Republic of Germany.  Projects  The Institute frequently organizes scientific conferences, colloquials and presentations on topics of Italian history and music history as well as the German-Italian relations. It issues several scholarships annually for young Ph.D. and post-doc scholars in the fields of history and music history. German scientists may apply for a one-year guest professorship granted once annually. Several internships of six weeks each are directed at students of history or music history, who focus on German-Italian relations or Italian (music) history. A course of Roman studies in autumn and a course of music history in the spring grants students insights in local history and monuments.  Publications  The DHI Rome issues several editions since 1892, reflecting the institute's spectrum of research. They include: = Editions und regesta = ; Repertorium Germanicum The Repertorium Germanicum is a collection of regesta, gathering all \\"German\\" topics in the Vatican registers and cameral stock from the Great Schism to the reformation (1378‚Äì1517) since 1897. ; Repertorium Poenitentiariae Germanicum In addition to the Repertorium Germanicum, the RPG (issued since 1998) offers a fundamental source edition for German history of the late Middle Ages. ; Nuntiaturberichte aus Deutschland Since 1892, a collection of historical sources concerning the Papal diplomacy of the 16th and 17th centuries. ; Instructiones Pontificum Romanorum This is a source collection of the instructions for the papal nuncios and delegates at European courts, issued since 1984. ; Concentus musicus A gathering of musical monuments selected and edited by the Department of Music History since 1973.

She won an apology and compensation from the government when she was in her eighties, wrote a book about her experiences, and spent the latter part of her life campaigning for an apology and restitution for all women who had been incarcerated under the law that imprisoned her. Early life Demerson was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. After her parents divorced, she lived in Toronto with her mother in a rooming house on Church Street. Her mother supported them by managing the rooming house and reading tea leaves in the parlour under the name \\"Madam Alice\\". Her father remained in Saint John, where he was a restaurateur. At the age of 18, she met Harry Yip in a Yonge Street cafe where he worked as a waiter. Finding him handsome, she attracted his attention and they began dating and she soon moved in with him. When her father found out that she was involved with a Chinese man, he took a train from Saint John to Toronto in order to seek the intervention of the Toronto Police. \\"Incorrigibile\\" Demerson, a white Canadian of European ancestry, was arrested at the home of her fianc√©, Harry Yip, by two constables after they entered the apartment with her father yelling \\"that's her\\". Pregnant with Yip's baby, she was convicted of being \\"incorrigible\\" under an 1897 law the Female Refuges Act. It allowed the government to arrest and institutionalize women between the ages of 16 and 35 for behaviour such as promiscuity, pregnancy out of wedlock, and public drunkenness. It was not repealed until 1964. Demerson was incarcerated at the Mercer Reformatory for Women in Toronto for a period of ten months. While incarcerated she gave birth to her son, Harry Jr., who at three months was taken away from her until her release. She was also subjected to several involuntary medical procedures by a 'reformatory' doctor, a leading eugenics practitioner searching for evidence of physical deficiencies contributing to the moral defectives of \\"unmanageable women\\".http://www.carillon.uregina.ca/10.24.02/story15.htm Upon her release from the Andrew Mercer Reformatory for Women in 1940, she married her fianc√©, Yip, but the marriage ended in divorce three years later. She said that her son was subjected to constant racist insults and she moved to Hong Kong with him, hoping to shield him from bigotry. However, she found herself in financial distress and sent him back to Toronto to live with her father who, unable to care for him, gave him up to foster care. He became estranged from his mother and drowned in a swimming accident at the age of 26. Demerson returned to Canada and settled in Vancouver where she remarried and had a daughter and a son. After separating from her second husband she raised those two children as a single parent and worked as a secretary in government and legal offices until her retirement. Lost Canadian Her marriage with Yip had committed an act which she soon found had stripped her of her Canadian citizenship under the 1946 Canadian Citizenship Act, in which woman who married a non-Canadian were deemed to have taken their husband's citizenship. However, an application for Chinese citizenship was denied by Chinese embassy officials and she remained officially stateless until 2004. Under the terms of the 1947 Citizenship Act a woman who applied to have her citizenship returned would receive it. Velma Demerson applied on November 13, 1948. She was finger- printed and given a \\"Declaration of Intention\\" to sign. This was an incorrect form signed by at least four persons. She was denied citizenship. Lawsuit After retiring, she moved back to Toronto in the late 1980s and began searching through government documents and researching her case in order to come to terms with what had happened to her in her youth. She ultimately sought out paralegal Harry Kopyto who became interested in her case and conducted legal research into the Female Refuges Act under which she imprisoned, and came to the conclusion that as a provincial law, it violated the Constitution by legislating in criminal law, which is an exclusively federal responsibility. In 2002, she sued the Ontario government for $11 million for pain and suffering during her incarceration. The Ontario Superior Court refused to hear the case, citing that the Ontario government is immune to lawsuits stemming from incidents prior to 1964. In late 2002 however, she settled out of court, receiving an apology from the Attorney-General of Ontario and financial compensation in an undisclosed amount from the provincial government. Demerson was one of the only survivors who, 60 years after her incarceration at the Andrew Mercer Reformatory in 1939, received compensation from the Ontario government. She was 81 by then. In 2018, MP Hedy Fry apologised to her on behalf of the Canadian government for the loss of her citizenship. Demerson return to Vancouver and died there in 2019. Books In 2004, she wrote a book about the events, Incorrigible, a part of the Life Writing Series from Wilfrid Laurier University Press. In 2002, she was awarded the J.S. Woodsworth Prize for anti-racism by the New Democratic Party of Canada. She wrote a second book in 2017, Nazis in Canada, 1919-1939: A Satirical Novel Based on Actual Characters, a satirical novel based on her experiences in the Andrew Mercer Reformatory for Women. She returned to British Columbia in 2018 and died in a Vancouver hospital on May 13, 2019, at the age of 98.

Generally, 3D bioprinting utilizes the layer-by-layer method to deposit materials known as bioinks to create tissue-like structures that are later used in medical and tissue engineering fields. Bioprinting covers a broad range of biomaterials. Currently, bioprinting can be used to print tissues and organs to help research drugs and pills. However, emerging innovations span from bioprinting of cells or extracellular matrix deposited into a 3D gel layer by layer to produce the desired tissue or organ. In addition, 3D bioprinting has begun to incorporate the printing of scaffolds. These scaffolds can be used to regenerate joints and ligaments. Process Bioprinting of 3D Convoluted Renal Proximal Tubules on Perfusable Chips 3D bioprinting generally follows three steps, pre-bioprinting, bioprinting, and post-bioprinting. = Pre-bioprinting = Pre-bioprinting is the process of creating a model that the printer will later create and choosing the materials that will be used. One of the first steps is to obtain a biopsy of the organ. Common technologies used for bioprinting are computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To print with a layer-by-layer approach, tomographic reconstruction is done on the images. The now-2D images are then sent to the printer to be made. Once the image is created, certain cells are isolated and multiplied. These cells are then mixed with a special liquefied material that provides oxygen and other nutrients to keep them alive. In some processes, the cells are encapsulated in cellular spheroids 500Œºm in diameter. This aggregation of cells does not require a scaffold, and are required for placing in the tubular-like tissue fusion for processes such as extrusion. = Bioprinting = In the second step, the liquid mixture of cells, matrix, and nutrients known as bioinks are placed in a printer cartridge and deposited using the patients' medical scans. When a bioprinted pre-tissue is transferred to an incubator, this cell-based pre-tissue matures into a tissue. 3D bioprinting for fabricating biological constructs typically involves dispensing cells onto a biocompatible scaffold using a successive layer-by- layer approach to generate tissue-like three-dimensional structures. Artificial organs such as livers and kidneys made by 3D bioprinting have been shown to lack crucial elements that affect the body such as working blood vessels, tubules for collecting urine, and the growth of billions of cells required for these organs. Without these components the body has no way to get the essential nutrients and oxygen deep within their interiors. Given that every tissue in the body is naturally composed of different cell types, many technologies for printing these cells vary in their ability to ensure stability and viability of the cells during the manufacturing process. Some of the methods that are used for 3D bioprinting of cells are photolithography, magnetic bioprinting, stereolithography, and direct cell extrusion. = Post- bioprinting = The post-bioprinting process is necessary to create a stable structure from the biological material. If this process is not well- maintained, the mechanical integrity and function of the 3D printed object is at risk. To maintain the object, both mechanical and chemical stimulations are needed. These stimulations send signals to the cells to control the remodeling and growth of tissues. In addition, in recent development, bioreactor technologies have allowed the rapid maturation of tissues, vascularization of tissues and the ability to survive transplants. Bioreactors work in either providing convective nutrient transport, creating microgravity environments, changing the pressure causing solution to flow through the cells, or add compression for dynamic or static loading. Each type of bioreactor is ideal for different types of tissue, for example compression bioreactors are ideal for cartilage tissue.  Bioprinting approach  Researchers in the field have developed approaches to produce living organs that are constructed with the appropriate biological and mechanical properties. 3D bioprinting is based on three main approaches: Biomimicry, autonomous self-assembly and mini-tissue building blocks. = Biomimicry= The first approach of bioprinting is called biomimicry. The main goal of this approach is to create fabricated structures that are identical to the natural structure that are found in the tissues and organs in the human body. Biomimicry requires duplication of the shape, framework, and the microenvironment of the organs and tissues. The application of biomimicry in bioprinting involves creating both identical cellular and extracellular parts of organs. For this approach to be successful, the tissues must be replicated on a micro scale. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the microenvironment, the nature of the biological forces in this microenvironment, the precise organization of functional and supporting cell types, solubility factors, and the composition of extracellular matrix. =Autonomous self-assembly= The second approach of bioprinting is autonomous self-assembly. This approach relies on the physical process of embryonic organ development as a model to replicate the tissues of interest. When cells are in their early development, they create their own extracellular matrix building block, the proper cell signaling, and independent arrangement and patterning to provide the required biological functions and micro- architecture. Autonomous self-assembly demands specific information about the developmental techniques of the tissues and organs of the embryo. There is a \\"scaffold-free\\" model that uses self-assembling spheroids that subjects to fusion and cell arrangement to resemble evolving tissues. Autonomous self- assembly depends on the cell as the fundamental driver of histogenesis, guiding the building blocks, structural and functional properties of these tissues. It demands a deeper understanding of how embryonic tissues mechanisms develop as well as the microenvironment surrounded to create the bioprinted tissues. =Mini-tissue= The third approach of bioprinting is a combination of both the biomimicry and self-assembly approaches, which is called mini tissues. Organs and tissues are built from very small functional components. Mini-tissue approach takes these small pieces and manufacture and arrange them into larger framework.  Printers  A 3D bioprinter Akin to ordinary ink printers, bioprinters have three major components to them. These are the hardware used, the type of bio-ink, and the material it is printed on (biomaterials). \\"Bio-ink is a material made from living cells that behaves much like a liquid, allowing people to 'print' it in order to create the desired shape. To make bio-ink, scientists create a slurry of cells that can be loaded into a cartridge and inserted into a specially designed printer, along with another cartridge containing a gel known as bio-paper.\\" test In bioprinting, there are three major types of printers that have been used. These are inkjet, laser-assisted, and extrusion printers. Inkjet printers are mainly used in bioprinting for fast and large-scale products. One type of inkjet printer, called drop-on-demand inkjet printer, prints materials in exact amounts, minimizing cost and waste. Printers that utilize lasers provide high-resolution printing; however, these printers are often expensive. Extrusion printers print cells layer-by-layer, just like 3D printing to create 3D constructs. In addition to just cells, extrusion printers may also use hydrogels infused with cells.  Applications  There are several applications for 3D bioprinting in the medical field. An infant patient with a rare respiratory disease known as tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) was given a tracheal splint that was created with 3D printing. 3D bioprinting can be used to reconstruct tissue from various regions of the body. Patients with end- stage bladder disease can be treated by using engineered bladder tissues to rebuild the damaged organ. This technology can also potentially be applied to bone, skin, cartilage and muscle tissue. Though one long-term goal of 3D bioprinting technology is to reconstruct an entire organ, there has been little success in printing fully functional organs. Unlike implantable stents, organs have complex shapes and are significantly harder to bioprint. A bioprinted heart, for example, must not only meet structural requirements, but also vascularization, mechanical load, and electrical signal propagation requirements. Israeli researchers constructed a rabbit-sized heart out of human cells in 2019. Impact 3D bioprinting contributes to significant advances in the medical field of tissue engineering by allowing for research to be done on innovative materials called biomaterials. Biomaterials are the materials adapted and used for printing three-dimensional objects. Some of the most notable bioengineered substances are usually stronger than the average bodily materials, including soft tissue and bone. These constituents can act as future substitutes, even improvements, for the original body materials. Alginate, for example, is an anionic polymer with many biomedical implications including feasibility, strong biocompatibility, low toxicity, and stronger structural ability in comparison to some of the body's structural material. Synthetic hydrogels are also commonplace, including PV-based gels. The combination of acid with a UV-initiated PV-based cross-linker has been evaluated by the Wake Forest Institute of Medicine and determined to be a suitable biomaterial. Engineers are also exploring other options such as printing micro-channels that can maximize the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen from neighboring tissues. In addition, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency aims to print mini organs such as hearts, livers, and lungs as the potential to test new drugs more accurately and perhaps eliminate the need for testing in animals.

The sole example flew in the early 1960s in the United States. Design and development Bede aircraft was formed to develop an STOL aircraft of novel construction, incorporating boundary layer control. They placed the design study with the Department of Aerodynamics at the University of Maryland. The boundary layer was controlled with a suction system via 160,0000 upper wing and aileron surface holes, with diameters ranging from 0.020 to 0.029 in (0.51 - 0.74 mm). Aluminium honeycombs were used throughout the fuselage as structural elements. The XBD-2 was powered by a pair of flat- six piston engines mounted inside the fuselage, driving a single pusher configuration propeller, turning within a circular shroud. The wing of the XBD-2 had an aspect ratio of 9 and 5¬∞ of dihedral. It was built around an aluminium box spar, was aluminium skinned and carried sealed all-metal ailerons. A 14 in (356 mm) Joy blower pulled air through the pinholes in the surfaces, venting it in the fuselage to cool the engines. Sealed flaps smoothly changed the wing camber and increased its area by about 15% when extended. Apart from its use of aluminium honeycomb, the front part of the flat-sided fuselage was conventional, with a cabin with space to seat four, though mostly filled with instrumentation. Aft, two 145 hp (108 kW) Continental O-300 engines were mounted one above the other. They drove the rear propeller shaft through ten V-belts via Sprag clutches to avoid engine speed synchronisation problems. The rear fuselage tapered to a vertical wedge with the propeller shaft emerging at its top. The circular shroud was attached to the fuselage by the fixed triangular fin mounted on the top of the fuselage, the triangular tailplane and a short boom at the bottom. The propeller rotated close to the shroud's leading edge; the shroud was intended partly to reduce propeller tip losses and also to act in the place of conventional stabilizing surfaces. The fin resumed above the shroud and carried the top of a high aspect ratio rudder behind the shroud's trailing edge, its bottom end attached to the tailboom, with a midpoint cutout to allow for elevator movement. The elevator was supported by tailplane extensions beyond the shroud, similar to that of the fin. Structurally, the shroud was a glass-fibre shell surrounding an aluminium spar and filled with polyurethane foam. The control surfaces were conventionally constructed from aluminium sheet. The XBD-2 had a fixed tricycle undercarriage, with wheels enclosed in fairings. The main legs were glass-fibre cantilevers, unusual at the time. After the XBD-2 first flew on 26 July 1961 it was flight tested and slightly modified to simplify future production. It was intended to lead to the BD-3, which would have been a six-seater with bigger engines, more use of honeycomb panels, retracting undercarriage and a laminar flow wing, but this was not built.

The buildings were part of the Hollandse Waterlinie, a defensive line around Amsterdam to protect the city from foreign invaders. The Oranje-Nassau Kazerne was built in the years 1810-1813 between the 17th-century bastions Outewaal and Oosterbeer to house the city's infantry garrison and the troops manning the defenses around the city.\\"Oranje-Nassau Kazerne\\", Stelling van Amsterdam (Dutch) The windmill De Gooyer on the bastion Oosterbeer had to be moved because the barracks took away too much wind.

After the Netherlands were annexed by Napoleon's French Empire, Napoleon ordered the construction of a large building that could not only house 2,400 garrison troops, but would also be imposing enough to express the magnificence of his empire to the citizens of Amsterdam. In 1810, Marshall Oudinot laid the first stone for the barracks, originally called the Quartier Saint-Charles. The design by the city architect Abraham van der Hart and the French artillery officer Picot de Maras was based on the Vauban barracks, which had no corridors; instead the soldiers' living quarters could be reached only through internal doors and staircases. The city was obliged to pay for the construction of the building. The costs amounted to 58,000 guilders for the purchase of the terrain and to pay damages to two millers, plus 701,888 guilders for the construction itself ‚Äî a massive amount of money in those days. Every citizen of Amsterdam was ordered to pay 5% of the rental worth of his house. Those who refused to pay, had to give room and board to French soldiers instead. Oranje-Nassau Kazerne toren 1, a new building on the former barracks compound In 1813 the barracks were complete. However, not long after, the French withdrew from the Netherlands. The building was renamed Oranje- Nassau Kazerne, after the House of Orange-Nassau which in 1814 became the royal house of the Netherlands. The coat of arms of Napoleon on the central pediment of the building was replaced with the coat of arms of the House of Orange-Nassau. On the pediments on the two sides of the buildings, the French eagle was replaced with the Dutch lion. The barracks were subsequently used to house the Dutch 7th Infantry Regiment, but the building was found to be too humid and drafty, and in 1830 it was declared unsuitable for housing. From 1839, it was used to house animals from the adjacent Artis zoo. Around 1860, the Dutch national government took over the building from the city. It was used to store artillery and military vehicles and, from 1892, to house the carrier pigeons of the military carrier pigeon service (Militaire Postduivendienst, later renamed Rijkspostduivenstation). During the 20th century, the building again served as barracks for infantry troops. This was also where the young men of Amsterdam who were called up for military service underwent their physical examinations. = Apartment and office building= The building received rijksmonument status in 1970. It was used as a barracks until 1987, when the last troops left the building. Plans were made to demolish the building, which had an unstable foundation that was estimated to cost 5 million guilders to restore. Following protests from local residents and the historic preservation society Monumentenzorg, new plans were presented to restore the building and convert it to apartments and offices. Architects from six countries worked together in the middle of 1988 under the coordination of Atelier PRO to create a new design based on six apartment towers. In 1989, the building was handed back to the city by the Dutch government, and about 150 government-funded rental apartments were constructed in the building. Additional windows were added in order to bring more light into the building. Also, some 3000 m¬≤ of office space was created on the ground floor and in the basement. In 1990, the first apartments were complete.

It originated in the late Middle Ages and was formally disbanded when the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in 1806. Map of the Wetterau by Matth√§us Merian  Prelude  Until the days of the Hohenstaufen, the Wetterau area was characterized by on the one hand a number of royal possessions, on the other hand a large number of small-scale territories held by counts or knights and imperial cities. When the Hohenstaufen and M√ºnzenberg families had died out by 1255, the various political forces in the Wetterau area became more apparent, in particular the large countly families of Hanau, Eppsten, Falkenstein and Isenburg-B√ºdingen. Other forces in the area were the Burgraviate of Friedberg, the Kaiserpfalz at Gelnhausen, associations of the lower nobility, Free Courts (in particular the court at Kaichen) and the cities of Friedberg, Frankfurt, Wetzlar and Gelnhausen. Since there was no dominant power and the area was located in the field of tension between the Landgraviate of Hesse and the Archbishopric of Mainz, the King retained his formative influence and his role as an alliance partner of the various counts longer than in other areas. The King was represented by a Landvogt until at least 1419. His area of responsibility reached further south and west than the later association of imperial counts. The Vogt was usually a member of one of the leading families of the area and would use his position to pursue his own territorial interests. The Late Medieval Perpetual Public Peace policy initially led to mixed alliances of higher and lower nobility in the Wetterau, including local knights, lords and counts. These associations formed the nucleus of the area's regional identity in a time of increasing distance between the social classes. Four stabilizing elements can be discerned during the transition from the late Middle Ages to the early modern era: * The four imperial cities. In the long term, only Frankfurt remained significant; * A group of knights and other noblemen, concentrated around Friedberg Castle and the Kaiserpfalz in Gelnhausen; * A number of Ganerbschaft arrangements, where noble families jointly held an undivided inheritance. These included the Reifenberg, Kronberg, Falkenstein, Lindheim, Dorheim and Staden families, and partially overlapped with the group mentioned previously; * The Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts, which overlapped with the two groups mentioned previously.  History  = Beginnings = The association was founded in 1422, as a successor organization to the imperial bailiff and the Perpetual Public Peace alliances. The trigger was probably a conflict between the Counts of County of Katzenelnbogen and the Landgraves of Landgraviate of Hesse when the latter attempted to expand its territory at the expense of the former and other counts and lords in the region. Among the initial members were: * Counts ** Katzenelnbogen (until 1479) ** Nassau-Dillenburg (joined in 1436) ** Nassau- Weilburg ** Rieneck ** Solms ** Wertheim ** Ziegenhain * Lords ** Eppstein ** Hanau ** Isenburg Although the counts and lords in the area bounded by the Rhine, the Main, the Vogelsberg mountains and the Rothaar range were all trying to create a common political organisation, the boundary of the area was blurred, both territorially and in terms of responsibilities. Neither the legal status of the Association, nor the territorial boundaries of the individual principalities were defined with any degree of precision. In 1479, the counts of Katzenelnbogen died out and their territory fell to Hesse. Nassau took over the lead of the Wetterau Association. In 1495, the alliance between Nassau, Solms, and Hanau (which had been raised to a County in 1429) was renewed and strengthened by the accession of the noble families Reifenberg, Kronberg, Falkenstein, Lindheim, Dorheim and Staden. However, these families left the association a short time later, to form the Middle Rhine canton of the Association of Imperial Knights. At the Diet of Worms in 1495, the Association was given a single vote in the Imperial Diet, to be shared among its members. From 1512, the Association regularly sent a representative to the Diet. = Second phase (1525-1575) =  Internal organization  No later than 1525 an area crystallized in the Wetterau and Westerwald areas, where almost all land was held by immediate counts. From 1540, a permanent director of the association was active. In 1565, the covenant was renewed by: * Nassau * Solms * Hanau-M√ºnzenberg * Hanau- Lichtenberg (for the district of Babenhausen) * Wittgenstein * Sayn * Stolberg-K√∂nigstein * Isenburg * Leiningen-Westerburg * Wied From the mid-16th Century, the counts all tried to form proper states out of their territories. They ran into the limits of what was politically feasible. They were hampered by a number of issues: their territories were small, neighbouring princes held customs and escort rights, parts of their territories were fiefs held from the same princes, and they were therefore considered vassals of those princes. As these issues made full statehood an unfulfilled dream, the Wetterau Association aimed to compensate the shortcomings of its members. The associations provided swift resolution for internal conflicts, and a coordinated approach to foreign threats. The association created and maintained a single economic and monetary space, with uniform policing and a uniform legal code (the Law Codes of Solms). Regulations pursuant to this uniformity were adopted by the association and then promulgated by each count in his own county, just like regulations adopted by the Emperor, the Diet, or the Imperial Circle. This promulgation was considered an important expression of sovereignty. The ability to keep the peace was seen as an expression of sovereign power. In the 16th century, the Wetterau Association was the main organizing power opposing the expansionist policies of the Landgrave of Hesse. This was achieved in close cooperation with the House of Habsburg, in spite of the religious differences that occurred after 1517.  Reformation  During the early phase of the Reformation, the counts used the circumstance to begin taxing the clergy. It wasn't until the 1530 that the counts began to issue Church Orders to organise the local church in their respective counties. Shortly before the Schmalkaldic War, the Association dropped its neutral stance on the issue and committed clear to the Augsburg Confession. When Emperor Charles V prepared for war, the Counts felt forced to support the apparently stronger Protestant side, at least verbally, as its leader, Landgrave Philip I of Hesse, was their neighbour. During the war, the Counts remained neutral and hesitated long, before deciding in 1547 to support the Emperor, who was already winning the war. In the meantime, they rejected federal proposals and implemented the Augsburg Interim only nominally and -- like almost all Protestant states -- in practice prevented its implementation. = Third phase: between 1576 and the Thirty Years' War =  Internal organization  In 1576, the internal organization of the Association was reformed significantly. A treaty of correspondence stipulated that one of the participating counts, to be elected annually, would act as spokesman and representative of the Association. The spokesman would decide when and where the Association would meet, and set the agenda. This made it much more likely that a decision could be made, as the representatives of the counts could be briefed beforehand on the issues that would be discussed at the meeting.

The mausoleum, built in the first half of the 14th century is partially demolished and has a cylindrical form with twelve semicircular facets. The mausoleum, which has a circular form in the inner part, is 30 meters high. Two minarets having quadrangular foundation in the lower part are located about 30 meters far from the mausoleum. The minarets of the ensemble belong to the 12th century. Garabaghlar Mausoleum is a complex including a tomb, two minarets and ruins of this monument locating between them. History of the minarets is dated back approximately to the late XII and early 13th centuries. Structure of a portal connecting two minarets of the mausoleum is the structure of the 14th century. There is a name of Goday khatun on this little portal. It is considered that this Goday khatun was Abaqa Khan‚Äôs (1265-1282) wife. It can make a conclusion that an architect, who set before himself a goal of building in honor of Gaday khatun within the new complexes built in the 12th‚Äì13th centuries, built this monument then. If it's true then it's possible that this building was built in honor of Goday khatun. The history of the monument and its minarets can be also dated back to the 12th century ‚Äì during the reign of Abu Said Bahadur khan (1319-1335) for its style and construction methods. Architectural characteristics The main characteristics of tower-shaped tombs can be seen in Garabaghlar mausoleum. The mausoleum is divided into two parts ‚Äì a burial vault in lower part and upper overground part. The burial vault's plan is similar to Barda mausoleum. The overground part of Garabaghlar mausoleum is very interesting for its architectural structure. A trunk of the mausoleum standing on a stone pedestal is originated from connection of 12 semicylinders. The mausoleum is distinguished from other mausoleums located in Azerbaijan for architectural structure of its trunk. There is a boom with calligraphically written inscription on the top of the trunk as in Barda mausoleum. This inscription on Garabaghlar mausoleum was written with letters of white color and its background was made of blue frieze. Four portals of the upper chamber are effectively allotted. Lancet arches with stalactitical infillings are centers of the southern, western and eastern portals. Slats with inscriptions written in neskh and stylized kufi are included into composition of portals. Stylized ornaments of plants dominate in the southern and western parts, but ornaments of the eastern part are geometric. Trunks of columns and their cubic capitals are also covered with composite mosaic. A complicated system of stalactites underline a line of archivolt, infilling the space of an arched niche. Golden glaze is sparingly interspersed with ornamental patterns of the portal, which is not met in the area of the mausoleum anymore. Thanks to the deep niches in sides of a central square, the burial vault of the mausoleum has taken the form of an equal-ended cross. It was covered with mirrored groin vault. Walls are encased with two rows of thoroughly drafted stone plates over which oversails brick placement of cushions. The upper chamber is a straight 12 edged dimension of oversailed proportions. Rectangular niches on the walls are framed by more narrow equilateral niches. Top of the 12 edged trunk is surrounded by two-layered stalactite corbel, used as a crossover to the inner cupola, which is folded by stone blocks. Foundations of two minarets attached to portal are prolonged rectangular prisms. Facades of the foundations are treated with patterned placing framed with trilobite equilateral arch. Not tall, octahedral bulk is used as a pedestrian to cylindrical trunks of the minarets built of circle brick. Narrow bricks with turquoise glaze were put to vertical junctures of placing. Image of the placing gets across an Arabic ligature, beginning in the trunk of one of the minarets and finishing in the other. The inscription is written in accurate kufi script, which is similar to inscription on Momine Khatun Mousileum's frame board. Terra-cotta colored letters were placed against a turquoise background ‚Äì this method is relatively rare in architecture found in Azerbaijan dating to the Middle Ages. Fa√ßade ornament of Garabaghlar Mausoleum consists of repeating words - ‚ÄúThere is no God but God, and Muhammad is His prophet. May God bless him‚Äù Top of the minarets are heavily demolished. Narrow spiral stairs built of simple tablet bricks (20x20x5) wave within the minarets. There are saved remains of imposts of arches and found out multiple remains of walls in different levels of masonries of the mausoleum's minarets. There was a significantly bigger portal in the place of existing one, about which evidence fragments of masonry, which oversails the bay between minarets. Glaze with mosaic patterns yields to glaze of the minarets and mausoleum in quality and its background is black. Glaze is covered with grid of capillary cracks and weakly connected to a crock. Motifs of ornaments of the mausoleum's decoration aren‚Äôt met in decors of the minarets‚Äô portal. Remains of an inscription written in neskh indicates about an order of construction of the mausoleum and name ‚Äú‚Ä¶Jehan Gudi-khatun‚Äù. Perhaps, there is mentioned Kufi-khatun, one of the wives of Hulaku khan, mother of Tekuder ‚Äì Sultan Ahmad. Excavations of 1940, found out walls of a building a band of which's placing is dated back to the same time with the placing of the minarets. Configuration of a plan and dimensions of premises reminds of khanega. Walls of the building are detached far from the mausoleum. Post stamp (2008) Peculiarities of architectural structure of the mausoleum indicate that masters of various architectural professions were involved in its construction. Despite a generality of the composition and architectural appearance of the portals, detailed representation of the arches‚Äô archivolts is also original. There are patterns which aren‚Äôt met in other portals. Ligatures common for style are differently interpreted and placed on planes; decorations included in images of the ligatures are diverse; butts of the ornament's band are authorized differently, which are common for some portals for their images. Characterizing architecture of the mausoleum, its corrugated surface, determining architectural expressiveness of its appearance in a significant level should be especially mentioned. This method acquired extremely wide propagation both timely and territorially. This method was initially met and widely used mainly in pre-feudal defense constructions of Trans-Caspian. Distribution of this method to memorial (Mausoleums of Garabaghlar, Radkan and Kishmar) and cultic (Jar-Kurgan) constructions dates back to the earlier time. Barda mausoleum is the most similar to Garabaghlar mausoleum by analogy.

It is thought to be a conjunction of two words, minang (\\"victorious\\") and kabau (\\"buffalo\\"). The legend told the story of a territorial dispute between the local West Sumatran people and a neighbouring invading prince. The invading prince and his troops were somehow traditionally associated with Javanese Majapahit kingdom. To avoid a battle, the local leader proposed a fight to the death between two water buffalo to settle the dispute. The prince agreed and set forward his largest, meanest, most aggressive buffalo. The locals set forth a hungry baby buffalo with its small horns ground to be as sharp as knives. Seeing the adult buffalo across the field, the baby ran forward, hoping for milk. The big buffalo saw no threat in the baby buffalo and paid no attention to it, looking around for a worthy opponent. But when the baby thrust his head under the big bull's belly, looking for an udder, the sharpened horns punctured and killed the bull, and the local people won the contest and the dispute, and thus named their tribe \\"Minangkabau\\" after the victorious buffalo to mark this important event. The moral of the story set an example of the use of wisdom and strategy to avoid war and violence. It also celebrated the intelligence and victory of Minangkabau people.  Buffalo symbolism  Kerbau or water buffalo is an important domesticated animal in Minangkabau culture. It can be employed to work the paddy fields in rice agriculture as well as provides milk and meat. The importance of buffalo as cultural symbol is also can be found in other Indonesian traditions, such as Torajan culture. Buffalo, especially its horns are important cultural symbol in Minangkabau culture. The roofline of traditional houses in West Sumatra, called Rumah Gadang (Minangkabau, \\"big house\\"), curves upward from the middle and end in points, in imitation of the water buffalo's upward-curving horns. The fabrics of Minangkabau women's headdresses are also folded and formed to imitate the buffalo's horn.  Historical record  The first mention of the name Minangkabau as Minanga Tamwan, is in the late 7th century Kedukan Bukit inscription, describing Sri Jayanasa's sacred journey from Minanga Tamwan accompanied with 20,000 soldiers heading to Matajap and conquering several areas in the southern of Sumatra.R.

He received several awards from the Indonesian government, including the title National Hero of Indonesia in 1964. Born in Purworejo, Dutch East Indies, Oerip exhibited leadership skills from an early age. As his parents wanted him to become a regent, after elementary school Oerip was sent to the School for Native Government Employees in Magelang. His mother died during his second year at the school, and Oerip left to undertake military training in Meester Cornelis, Batavia (modern-day Jatinegara, Jakarta). Upon graduating in 1914, he became a lieutenant in the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army; during almost 25 years of service he was stationed on three different islands and promoted several times, eventually becoming the highest-ranking Native officer in the country. Oerip resigned from his position in about 1938 after a disagreement with the regent of Purworejo, where he had been stationed. He and his wife Rohmah then moved to a village near Yogyakarta, where they established a large garden and villa. After Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands in May 1940 Oerip was recalled to active duty. When the Empire of Japan occupied the Indies less than two years later, Oerip was arrested and detained in a prisoner-of-war camp for three and a half months. He spent the rest of the occupation at his villa. On 14 October 1945, several months after Indonesia proclaimed its independence, Oerip was declared the chief of staff and interim leader of the newly formed army. Working to build a united force from the fractured former military groups in the country, Oerip received little oversight owing to irregularities in the chain of command. On 12 November 1945 General Sudirman was selected as leader of the armed forces, while Oerip remained as chief of staff. The two oversaw almost three years of development during the Indonesian National Revolution, until Oerip resigned in early 1948 because of the political leadership's lack of trust in the army. His health deteriorated; he was already suffering from a weak heart, and he died of a heart attack a few months later. He was posthumously promoted to full general.  Early life  The Soemohardjo family home in Sindurjan Oerip Soemohardjo was born Moehammad Sidik (\\"Little Muhammad\\") in his family's home in Sindurjan, Purworejo, Dutch East Indies (a colony of the Netherlands), on 22 February 1893. He was the first son born to Soemohardjo, a headmaster and son of a local Muslim leader, and his wife, the daughter of Raden Tumenggung Widjojokoesoemo, the regent of Trenggalek; the family later had two more sons, Iskandar and Soekirno, as well as three daughters. The boys were raised partly by servants, and at a young age Sidik began showing leadership qualities, commanding groups of neighbourhood children in fishing and games of football. The brothers attended the school for Javanese headed by their father, and as a result received special treatment; this led to them becoming complacent and frequently misbehaving. In his second year of school, Sidik fell from a candlenut tree and lost consciousness. After he awoke, his mother sent a letter to Widjojokoesoemo, who decided that Sidik's name was the cause of his misbehaviour. In reply, Widjojokoesoemo wrote that Sidik should be renamed Oerip, which means \\"alive\\". When he recovered fully, his family decided that the newly renamed Oerip ‚Äì who continued to misbehave ‚Äì should study at the local Dutch School for Girls (); the schools for boys were full and they hoped that the girls' school would improve Oerip's skill in Dutch, the language of the regime, as well as his temperament. After a year in the girls' school, in which Oerip became calmer, he was sent to a Dutch-run school for boys. However, his academic results continued to be poor. Beginning in his final year of elementary school, he often visited his friend's father, an ex-soldier who had served in Aceh for twenty years, to listen to the old man's stories, which inspired Oerip to join the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (, or KNIL). After passing an exam for would-be state employees and several months of preparations, Oerip moved to Magelang in 1908 to attend the School for Native Government Employees (, or OSVIA); his parents intended for him to become a regent like his grandfather. The following year his brothers joined him. After his mother died in 1909, Oerip sank into a months-long bout of depression and became withdrawn. After finishing the year at OSVIA, he decided to enrol at the military academy in Meester Cornelis, Batavia (modern-day Jatinegara, Jakarta). He went there directly from Magelang, and told his brothers to inform their father, who disapproved of his son's choice. Soemohardjo initially attempted to bribe his son with 1,000 gulden to return to OSVIA, but eventually agreed to pay for Oerip's tuition. After his training, during which he found military life enjoyable, Oerip graduated from the academy in October 1914 and became a second lieutenant in the KNIL.  Royal Netherlands East Indies Army  After several days visiting his father in Purworejo, Oerip returned to Meester Cornelis where he took up a posting to Battalion XII. Even though he was the smallest man in the unit and the only native, he was placed in a position of leadership. A year and half later he was sent to Banjarmasin, Borneo. After a period patrolling the jungles outside Puruk Cahu and Muara Tewe, he was sent to Tanah Grogot, followed by Balikpapan. While stationed there Oerip was promoted to first lieutenant but faced discrimination as a native in the Dutch forces. In Banjarmasin he had convinced his commander to strike an ordinance forbidding non-Dutch officers from joining the football team, and by 1917 Oerip had received equal legal status with Dutch officers. After Balikpapan Oerip was further sent to Samarinda, Tarakan, and ultimately Malinau. In Malinau, Oerip patrolled the border between the Dutch East Indies and the British-controlled Kingdom of Sarawak (part of modern-day Malaysia); he also worked to prevent conflicts and headhunting among Dayak tribes. One day, seven years after arriving in Borneo, Oerip returned from patrol to find his home had been burned down. Upon the recommendation of a passing doctor, Oerip went back to Java, via Tarakan and Surabaya, to Cimahi, where he spent several months in recovery from fatigue. Fully recovered, in 1923 Oerip was stationed in his hometown, Purworejo. In September 1925 Oerip was transferred to Magelang to serve in the (Foot Marshalry), a gendarmerie. Initially known to avoid women and under pressure to marry quickly, in Magelang Oerip became involved with Rohmah Soebroto, the daughter of his former Javanese and Malay language teacher Soebroto and a distant relative of female emancipation figure Kartini. The pair were engaged on 7 May 1926 and married on 30 June of the same year. Also in Magelang, Oerip took on his father's name, which he used as a family name for dealing with the Dutch. Afterwards he began referring to himself by the full name of Oerip Soemohardjo, although others continued to call him Oerip. The year after his marriage, Oerip and his wife were stationed in Ambarawa, where Oerip was tasked with rebuilding a previously disbanded unit. While training local recruits in place of the Dutch commander who had yet to arrive, Oerip was promoted to captain. After the Dutch commander arrived, in July 1928 Oerip was given a year's leave, which he used to travel throughout Europe on a sightseeing trip with his wife. Upon his return to the Indies, he was stationed at Meester Cornelis. In Meester Cornelis, Oerip began running training exercises; while stationed in Batavia, his father died. In 1933, he was sent to Padang Panjang in Sumatra to deal with unrest that had already killed several Dutch officers. His time in Padang Panjang passed uneventfully, and in July 1935 he was given leave to go to Europe again. He was also promoted to major at that time, which made him the highest-ranking native officer in the KNIL. The following year, upon his return to the Indies, he was stationed in Purworejo. In mid-1938, after a disagreement with the local regent, Oerip was told to transfer to Gombong; he refused, then left the KNIL and moved to his parents-in-law's home in Yogyakarta.  Civilian life and Japanese occupation  In Yogyakarta, the unemployed Oerip took up orchid gardening. Soon after arriving, he and his wife bought a villa in Gentan, north of the city. Although the villa was small, the couple used its of land to open a large flower garden, with their income subsidised by Oerip's pension from the KNIL. At his villa, named KEM (for , or \\"Purity and Bravery\\"), Oerip often received guests, both military and civilian, from whom he received information about current events and to whom he gave advice regarding military matters and politics. In 1940, the pair adopted a four-year-old Dutch girl named Abby from an orphanage in Semarang. Shortly thereafter, on 10 May 1940, when Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands, Oerip was recalled to active service. Three days after reporting to Colonel Pik in Magelang, he went to the KNIL headquarters in Bandung, where he was the first retired officer to report. Afterwards, he and his family ‚Äì who had joined him ‚Äì were transferred to Cimahi, where Oerip was tasked with establishing a new battalion depot. Several native officers were stationed in northern parts of the Indies during 1941 in preparation for an expected attack by the Empire of Japan, although Oerip stayed in Cimahi. After the Japanese occupied the Indies in early 1942, Oerip was held in a mixed prisoner of war camp in Cimahi. Upon his release three and a half months later, Oerip refused an offer to form a new, Japanese- backed police force and returned to KEM, where he and his wife rented paddy fields to grow rice while continuing to operate their flower garden. To protect their land, they surrounded their property and home with a high bamboo fence. Although no longer active in the military, Oerip occasionally received former KNIL members, including Abdul Haris Nasution and Sunarmo, who brought news of events outside the village. The couple continued their work, harassed and surveilled by the Japanese and pro-Japanese Indonesians, until the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in early August 1945 signified that Japan would soon withdraw. It was during this period that Oerip began having heart problems.  Indonesian National Revolution and death  The first dedicated TKR headquarters, in Gondokusuman, Yogyakarta; it is now the Dharma Wiratama Museum. After the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence on 17 August 1945, Oerip and his family left KEM for Rohma's parents' home in Yogyakarta. When the People's Safety Body (, or BKR) was formed on 23 August, Oerip led a group of military commanders who petitioned for it to be set up as a national military formation; a separate group, led by politician Oto Iskandar di Nata, wanted the BKR to fulfil the functions of a police organisation. The political leadership, consisting of President Sukarno and Vice President Mohammad Hatta, agreed to a compromise: it became a police-style organisation, but most of its members had served in the military, either with the Defenders of the Homeland (, or PETA) or the Heih≈ç. On 14 October 1945 ‚Äì nine days after the Indonesian National Armed Forces was formally established ‚Äì Oerip was declared its Chief of Staff and interim leader, and left immediately for Jakarta. In a cabinet meeting the following day, he was ordered to build a national army, headquartered in Yogyakarta, in preparation for an expected assault by Dutch troops coming to reclaim the Indies. He departed for Yogyakarta on 16 October, and arrived the following day. He first established the headquarters in a room at Hotel Merdeka, which he used until the Sultan of Yogyakarta Hamengkubuwono IX donated land and a building for the army to use. With the BKR scattered under independent leadership throughout the country, the newly formed People's Security Army ( or TKR, now known as the ) drew officers mainly from the native members of the former KNIL. However, these officers were poorly received by Indonesian nationalists, who viewed them as mercenaries for having served in the Dutch forces. Meanwhile, rank and file members of the TKR were drawn from numerous groups, including former PETA, current Pemuda (young Indonesian revolutionaries), and the BKR. Although Oerip set out a command structure, in reality the army's hierarchy was provisional and depended heavily on the strength of local units. Following a government decree on 20 October Oerip became subordinate to both the acting Minister of Defence Soeljoadikoesoemo and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces Soeprijadi. However, neither man showed up to assume his duties. Soeprijadi, a PETA soldier who had led an uprising against Japanese forces in Blitar in February 1945, was thought dead. While Soeljohadikosomo's position remained unfilled, the guerrilla leader Moestopo declared himself Minister of Defence. As such, Oerip had little oversight and felt pressured to quickly establish a stable command structure. On 2 November, he appointed leaders for military operations in various parts of the country: Didi Kartasasmita for western Java, Soeratman for central Java, Mohammad for eastern Java, and Soehardjo Hardjowardojo for Sumatra; each of these sub-commanders was given the rank of major general. Oerip also began appropriating weapons to different TKR commands. He took confiscated Japanese weapons from well-equipped forces and distributed them as needed. However, the results were less successful than he had hoped. PETA had been organised locally during the Japanese occupation, and as such its members were unable to accept a centralised leadership. General Sudirman was elected as leader of the TKR on 12 November 1945. He kept Oerip as his chief of staff. On 12 November 1945, at the first general meeting of army leadership, General Sudirman ‚Äì the leader of the Fifth Division in Purwokerto, who had two years military experience and was 23 years younger than Oerip ‚Äì was elected leader of the army following two deadlocked votes. In the third round, Oerip had 21 votes to Sudirman's 22. Divisional commanders from Sumatra, who had voted unanimously, swayed the vote in Sudirman's favour; Oerip had lost votes because some of the division leaders distrusted his history with the KNIL and the oath he had taken to the Dutch motherland upon graduation. Although Sudirman was surprised at his selection and offered to surrender the leadership position to Oerip, the meeting did not allow it; Oerip himself was glad to no longer be in charge of the army. Sudirman kept Oerip, by then a lieutenant general, to serve as chief of staff under him. While Sudirman remained unconfirmed, Oerip remained de jure leader; however, the Indonesian journalist Salim Said writes that Oerip's orders were at times unintelligible owing to the leader's poor command of Indonesian and often ignored unless approved by Sudirman. When General Sudirman was approved on 18 December, he began working to consolidate and unite the army. Meanwhile, Oerip handled day- to-day organisational and technical issues. Many of the details, such as company uniforms, he left to regional commanders. However, to deal with more important issues, such as establishing a military police and preventing enemy paratroopers from landing, he passed edicts that applied nationally. Together, Sudirman and Oerip were able to address many of the differences between former KNIL and PETA troops. The government also renamed the army twice in January 1946, first to the People's Safety Army (), then to the Republic of Indonesia Military Forces(, or TRI). On 23 February 1946, Oerip was appointed head of the 11-member Committee to Reorganise the Army (), formed by presidential decree. After four months of discussion, on 17 May the committee gave its recommendations to Sukarno. Oerip was set to handle day-to-day operations of a downsized army, while the Ministry of Defence was given greater bureaucratic power. Sudirman was kept as commander of the young armed forces. As Minister of Defence Amir Sjarifuddin began establishing pro-leftist groups within the military, Oerip became distrustful of the political leadership and vehemently decried the government's attempts to use soldiers' political affiliations to control the military. Still, he and Sudirman continued to work to ensure that paramilitary troops (), which had arisen from the general populace, were included in the military. This was realised on 3 June 1947, when the government declared the union of the laskar and TRI into a new military organisation, the Indonesian National Armed Forces (, or TNI). Meanwhile, Oerip established a military academy in Yogyakarta. Oerip's grave in Yogyakarta To meet the Dutch threat, Oerip intended to attack while the former colonists were still consolidating their forces, a plan that was quashed by the government's attempts at diplomacy. He preferred guerrilla tactics to formal military conflicts, once telling a subordinate that the best attack would be one with a hundred snipers hidden behind enemy lines. Oerip was strongly against the Renville Agreement, an ultimately unsuccessful treaty that led to the withdrawal of 35,000 troops from western Java and the formalisation of the Van Mook Line between Dutch and Indonesian forces. He saw the agreement, ratified on 17 January 1948, as a stalling tactic, giving the Dutch the chance to strengthen their forces. Meanwhile, Amir Sjarifuddin ‚Äì by then also serving as prime minister ‚Äì began culling the army, predominantly keeping leftist-leaning troops. Disgusted with what he perceived as the government's lack of trust in the military, Oerip tendered his resignation, although he continued to serve as an advisor to the Minister of Defence, Vice President Hatta. After several months of growing steadily weaker and undergoing treatment from Dr Sim Ki Ay, on the evening of 17 November 1948 Oerip collapsed and died from a heart attack in his room in Yogyakarta. After a night-long viewing he was buried the next day in Semaki Heroes' Cemetery and posthumously promoted to general. When Sudirman threatened to resign in 1949, he blamed Oerip's death ‚Äì as well as his own tuberculosis ‚Äì on the government's inconsistency during the revolution. Oerip was survived by his wife and adopted daughter. Abby died of malaria in January 1951, and Rohmah died on 29 October 1977 in Semarang; she was buried in Ungaran.  Legacy  Oerip on a 1993 Indonesian stamp Oerip received numerous awards from the national government posthumously, including the Bintang Sakti (1959), Bintang Mahaputera (1960), Bintang Republik Indonesia Adipurna (1967), and Bintang Kartika Eka Pak√ßi Utama (1968). On 10 December 1964 he was declared a National Hero of Indonesia through Presidential Decree 314 of 1964. Sudirman was also declared a National Hero by the same decree. On 22 February 1964 the Indonesian military academy in Magelang dedicated a memorial to him, which described the military leader as \\"a son of Indonesia who valued work over words, who prioritised his Duty over his wants.\\" The academy's Catholic chapel also includes a dedication to him from 1965, prompted by a discussion between Rohmah and a missionary friend of hers. Several streets are named after Oerip, including in his hometown of Purworejo, nearby Yogyakarta, and the capital at Jakarta.

The number of antisemitic incidents rose sharply after the 1998 Russian financial crisis, the devaluation of the ruble, and the ensuing economic hardships affecting a broad segment of the general population. High-profile antisemitic voices have included several Russian Communist public figures such as Nikolai Kondratenko, a former governor of Krasnodar Krai. He claimed the Kremlin was controlled by Jews and Zionists, to blame for the demise of the Communist Party, the Chechen conflict and other problems. He formed an alliance with local Cossacks and was said to believe that an international Jewish conspiracy rules the world.Georgy Lesskis, \\"A chauvinist at the Helm in Krasnodar\\", Diagnosis, December 1997 p.2 Other high- profile figures have included deputies of the State Duma from the CPRF such as Albert Makashov and Viktor Ilyukhin. On November 1998 the State Duma considered and rejected a measure to denounce Makashov. In late December 1998 Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Russian Communist Party, was under pressure to publicly censure the bigoted statements of his comrades and did indeed denounce antisemitism, but at the same time labeled Zionism \\"a blood relative of fascism\\".Washington Post, November 8, 1998 Since the mid-2000s incorporation of antisemitic discourse into the platforms and speeches of nationalist political movements in Russia has been reported by human rights monitors in Russia as well as in the press. Antisemitic slogans and rhetoric in public demonstrations are frequently reported, most of them attributed to nationalist parties and political groups such as \\"Rusoslav Orthodox\\". Member of Duma Vladimir Zhirinovsky is known for antisemitic speeches. In 2001, 98 United States Senators penned a letter to President Putin, expressing concern about popular antisemitism, radical extremists (such as former Klansman and Grand Wizard David Duke) in the Russian Federation. In January 2005 a group of twenty Members of Duma published a statement accusing Jews of being anti- Christian, inhumane, committing ritual murder and that \\"the entire democratic world today is under the financial and political control of international Jewry\\". On June 9, 2005, Russian Orthodox Patriarch Alexei II addressed the international conference of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in Cordoba, Spain, to declare that the Russian Orthodox Church shares concerns over \\"incidents of antisemitism, xenophobia and other forms of racism\\".

They were recently signed under Warner Music Philippines. Background Originally named after where Relly and Regie Mangubat lived, near Marikina, as The Marikina Sound Machine, they later changed their name to Stonefree. The band started in 1995 after the Mangubat brothers decided to form a band, adding Valera and Tanoja to the group, all hailing from UP Diliman. Contrary to what most people believe, Stonefree is not named after Jimi Hendrix's song but rather a selection made out of a list of other names. They also stress that the name Stonefree also connotes that rock bands need not the typical \\"rockstar\\" attitude to succeed. During their college heyday in UP, they had regular gigs on local bars performing songs from their influences like Matchbox 20, Jars of Clay and Incubus to name a few. They also performed at events like the San Miguel Oktoberfest, NU Summer Shebang, Pulp Summer Slam, Winston Tour, Rockista, 99.5 RT Ripe Tomatoes, NU Rock Awards, and MTV Music Summit. They got their break in 2002 after joining Monster Radio RX 93.1's band competition, The RX Band Breakout. Although they did not win, their single \\"Listen\\" became a hit and even became Monster Radio RX 93.1 OPM Song of the Year and placed at #3 on 103.5 K-Lite's Yearend Countdown in 2003. The success of \\"Listen\\" gave them the start they needed to self-produce a 4-track EP, also entitled Listen, on July 23, 2004. The singles from their EP became hits of their own, \\"Listen\\" was a theme on an ABC-5 TV show called Singles. \\"Kapag Nawala Ka\\", their second single, gained radio success too. \\"Baka Naman\\" and \\"Listen\\" were also included in a couple of compilation CDs. This success led them to a record deal under Warner Music Philippines where they released their debut album, Hibiscus (named after the street where their rehearsal studio is at), on August 19 of the same year. The album was produced by Louie Talan and mastered by Imago's Zach Lucero. Rivermaya's Mark Escueta was among their guest performers on the album. The album received success all over the nation as their singles \\"Ikot\\" and \\"Sayang\\" peaked at various radio countdowns in the Philippines with the latter nominated in the 19th Awit Awards for Best Performance by a New Group. \\"Langit\\" was also featured in the Pinoy Big Brother DVD. The album also received many praises, Magic 89.9 gave it a perfect rating, boosting its sales. Not only were they radio friendly, but they also got featured on several TV shows even before the release of their debut album. Their videos proved to have a lasting mark even on local music stations where they also received success on the MYX Daily Countdown and MTV Diyes. Following their success was the release of their sophomore album, DeLorean on March 17, 2007. \\"Anghel\\" was their carrier single and also received success on both radio and local music channels. In mid 2010, the lead drummer and bassist, Relly and Regie, left the band. The band was then joined by Billy Reyes (Kikomachine) on guitars, Jody Salas (the Brew) on bass, and Nico Pineda (Chubibo) on drums. They recorded a third record, Providence. They were later joined by Shan Regalado (Mayonaise) in drums. In 2014, Stonefree briefly reunited with the original members, Relly and Regie, for a reunion gig. Vocalist Miro Valera competed in The Voice of the Philippines (season 2) where in he became a finalist. Influences Grunge is what they consider to be their greatest influence. Although traces of other genres (funk, jazz, pop) may be heard on their albums, the band looks up to Radiohead, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam, Goo Goo Dolls, Stone Temple Pilots and Matchbox 20 to name a few, whose songs they usually performed when they were just starting out.

Because he was both born and died before his father's ascension as King, in 1811, he was never Prince Royal of Haiti, nor was he ever heir apparent to the throne.  Early life  He was born in 1794 in Cap-Fran√ßais (Le Cap), Saint-Domingue, now known as Cap-Ha√Øtien, Haiti, as the first child and eldest son of Henri Christophe, a Field General and former slave, and Marie-Louise Coidavid, the daughter of a black hotel owner. Although not yet royalty, Christophe had big plans for his son and wanted him to follow in his footsteps. In a conversation with a friend, Christophe once proudly said of his infant son: \\"Never have I seen a finer baby than my little Francois-Ferdinand. He is strong and strapping, like me. He recognized me. He caught hold of my finger and smiled. He is the image of me!\\"  Education and death  When he was the appropriate age, Christophe started making plans for Fran√ßois-Ferdinand's education. He wanted his son to be a military man, like he was. As a young boy, Fran√ßois-Ferdinand was sent by his father to France, more specifically to Paris, where Christophe hoped that his son would receive a sturdy, military education. Instead, the Parisians, freshly defeated by the Haitian armies led by Christophe, in numerous battles, took Fran√ßois-Ferdinand out of school and made him a hostage. Christophe, learning of this situation, demanded explanations. The French promised that his son would receive a liberal education; instead, they placed Fran√ßois-Ferdinand in an orphans' asylum in Paris. On October 7, 1805, the 11-year-old boy died at the Orphans' Hospital of Paris. Both the circumstances of his death and his burial place are unknown. Even after Christophe became King Henri I of Haiti, he remained heartbroken because of his son's death. His official historian, forced to make constant references to the boy's lonely death in France, referred to Fran√ßois- Ferdinand with the title of prince, though he was never entitled to use it during his lifetime.

He wished the university to establish a Sanskrit professorship to assist in the conversion of the people of British India to Christianity, and his bequest was also used to fund scholarships in Sanskrit at Oxford. The first two professors were elected by Oxford graduates, as the university's statutes provided: Horace Hayman Wilson won by a narrow majority in 1832, and the 1860 election was hotly contested, as the rivals each claimed to be best at fulfilling Boden's intentions and presented different views about the nature and purpose of Sanskrit scholarship. Reforms of Oxford implemented in 1882 removed all mention of Boden's original purpose from the statutes, removed the power to elect the professor from graduates, and gave the holder of the professorship a fellowship at Balliol College, Oxford. Four of the first five professors were born in British India or had worked there. To date, Sir Monier Monier-Williams (professor 1860‚Äì99) has held the chair the longest, although a deputy was appointed to carry out his teaching duties for the last 11 years of his life. The current holder (), Christopher Minkowski, was appointed in 2005 and is the eighth Boden professor. His predecessor, Richard Gombrich, has said that he had to fight to ensure that he was replaced on retirement; his view was that Oxford retained the chair in Sanskrit because it was the last such position in the United Kingdom. Foundation Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Boden, after whom the professorship in Sanskrit at the University of Oxford is named, served in the Bombay Native Infantry of the East India Company from 1781 until his retirement in 1807. He moved to Lisbon, Portugal, for the sake of his health, and died there on 21 November 1811. His daughter Elizabeth died in August 1827, and Boden's will provided that his estate should then pass to the University of Oxford to establish a professorship in Sanskrit. His purpose, as set out in his will dated 15 August 1811, was to convert the peoples of India to Christianity \\"by disseminating a knowledge of the Sacred scriptures among them\\". Elizabeth was buried in a vault at Holy Trinity Church, Cheltenham, where a memorial stone sets out an extract from Boden's will about the bequest, and records that Boden's estate was worth about ¬£25,000 in 1827. The university accepted Boden's bequest in November 1827, and the first professor was elected in 1832. His bequest is also used to fund the Boden Scholarship, awarded \\"for the encouragement of the study of, and proficiency in, the Sanskrit Language and Literature\\". Elections =Election of 1832= The first and second Boden professors were chosen by Convocation (which at that time was the main governing body of the university, comprising all who had graduated with a master's degree or a doctorate). In 1832, the voters had a choice of two candidates: Horace Hayman Wilson and William Hodge Mill. Wilson, a surgeon by training, worked in India for the East India Company and was involved in various scholarly and educational activities. Mill had been principal of Bishop‚Äôs College, Calcutta, since 1820. Despite his abilities as a scholar, Wilson was seen by some in the university as too close to Hindu leaders to be appointed to a post which had the purpose of helping to convert India to Christianity, and his links to the theatrical world in Calcutta were considered to be disreputable. Nevertheless, he defeated Mill by 207 votes to 200 when the election was held on 15 March 1832. Another candidate, Graves Haughton (a professor at the East India Company College), had earlier withdrawn from the election in favour of Wilson (one of his former pupils) as they had many friends in common and he did not want to split their loyalties. For his \\"candid and honourable conduct\\" throughout the election he received a written address of appreciation signed by two hundred members of the university, including professors and the heads of seven of the colleges. =Election of 1860= After Wilson's death in 1860, there was a contest between Monier Williams and Max M√ºller to succeed him. Williams was an Oxford-educated Englishman who had spent 14 years teaching Sanskrit to those preparing to work in British India for the East India Company. M√ºller was a German-born lecturer at Oxford specialising in comparative philology, the science of language. Williams laid great stress in his campaign on Boden's intention that the holder should assist in converting India through dissemination of the Christian scriptures.Beckerlegge, pp. 333‚Äì334. M√ºller's view was that his work was of great value to missionaries, and published testimonials accordingly, but was also a worthy end in itself.Beckerlegge, pp. 334‚Äì335. The rival campaigns took out newspaper advertisements and circulated manifestos, and different newspapers backed each man. The election came at a time of public debate about Britain's role in India particularly after the Indian Rebellion of 1857‚Äì58, in particular whether greater efforts should be made to convert India or whether to remain sensitive to local culture and traditions.Beckerlegge, pp. 186, 201. Although generally regarded as superior to Williams in scholarship, M√ºller had the double disadvantage (in the eyes of some) of being German and having liberal Christian views.Dowling, p. 164. Some of the newspaper pronouncements in favour of Williams were based on a claimed national interest of having an Englishman as Boden professor to assist with the work of governing and converting India. As the religious historian Gwilym Beckerlegge has stated, \\"voting for the Boden Chair was increasingly taking on the appearance of being a test of patriotism.\\"Beckerlegge, p. 196. At the end of the hard-fought campaign, Williams won by a majority of over 220 votes. Duties and regulations The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge Act 1877 continued a process of reform imposed by Parliament that had begun in the middle of the 19th century, and empowered a group of commissioners to lay down new statutes for the university and its colleges. The commissioners' powers included the ability to rewrite trusts and directions attached to gifts that were 50 years old or more. The statutes governing the Boden chair were revised by the commissioners in 1882; there was no mention thereafter of Joseph Boden's original proselytising purpose. The professor was required to \\"deliver lectures and give instruction on the Sanskrit Language and Literature\\", to contribute towards the pursuit and advancement of knowledge, and to \\"aid generally the work of the University.\\" He had to provide instruction for at least four days each week during at least twenty-one weeks each year, without further fee, to all students who had given him \\"reasonable notice\\" of attending, and to deliver public lectures. Instead of election by Convocation, the new statutes provided that the electors would be the Secretary of State for India, the Corpus Christi Professor of Comparative Philology, the Sanskrit Professor at the University of Cambridge, someone nominated by Balliol College and someone nominated by the university's governing body.Statutes, pp. 90‚Äì91. Revisions by the commissioners to the statutes of Balliol College in 1882 provided that the Boden professor was to be a Fellow of the college from then onwards.Statutes, p. 194 and p. 213. Further changes to the university's internal legislation in the 20th and early 21st centuries abolished specific statutes for the duties of, and rules for appointment to, individual chairs such as the Boden professorship. The University Council is now empowered to make appropriate arrangements for appointments and conditions of service, and the college to which any professorship is allocated (Balliol in the case of the Boden chair) has two representatives on the board of electors. In 2008, Richard Gombrich said that he had had to \\"fight a great battle\\" in 2004 to ensure that another Boden professor was appointed to succeed him on his retirement, and credited his victory to the university's realisation that it was the last chair in Sanskrit left in the United Kingdom.

He published articles in the journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, of which he was secretary for 21 years. Opposing compulsory Christian tuition for Indian students, he favoured traditional Indian education mixed with studies of the English language and Western learning, although he regarded Indian culture as inferior to that of the Western world. He arrived in Oxford in 1833 after his election in 1832, but moved to London in 1836 to be librarian at East India House, the company's headquarters, travelling back to Oxford as necessary to carry out his duties. He held both positions until his death in 1860. - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  align=\\"center\\"1860‚Äì99 Balliol and University colleges Balliol (from 1882) Williams (who became Sir Monier Monier-Williams in 1887) was born in India, the son of an army officer. Educated in England, he trained for the East India Company's civil service at the company's college, but news of the death of his brother in battle in India prompted him to return to Oxford and study Sanskrit with Wilson, winning the Boden scholarship. Graduating in 1844, he was professor of Sanskrit, Persian and Hindustani at the company's college until 1858, when it closed after the Indian rebellion. As Boden professor, he wanted to create stronger links between India and England with the creation of a specialist institute at Oxford. His advocacy and fundraising at home and overseas led to the Indian Institute opening in 1884 (completed 1896), and he gave about 3,000 manuscripts and books to its library. He retired from teaching in 1887; Arthur Macdonell was appointed as his deputy in 1888 and in due course succeeded him. - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  align=\\"center\\"1899‚Äì1926 University of G√∂ttingen, Corpus Christi College, and University of Leipzig Balliol Macdonell was born in India, where his father was a colonel in a local regiment, and lived there until he was six or seven. He spent several school years in Germany before studying Sanskrit and comparative philology at G√∂ttingen University. He studied literae humaniores (classics) at Oxford, also winning scholarships in German, Chinese and Sanskrit. After lecturing in German and Sanskrit at Oxford and obtaining his doctorate from Leipzig, he was appointed as deputy to Monier-Williams in 1888, succeeding him in 1899. Macdonell developed the library and museum of the Indian Institute, raised funds in India for a scholarly edition of the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata, and helped the Bodleian Library acquire many Sanskrit manuscripts. His main scholarly interest was Vedic Sanskrit, producing books on its mythology and grammar, and editions of some Vedic texts. - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  align=\\"center\\"1927‚Äì37 Trinity College Balliol Thomas read classics and Indian languages at Cambridge then spent six years teaching before becoming assistant librarian, later the librarian, of the India Office. After 24 years as librarian, arranging and studying the many books and manuscripts the India Office had acquired, he spent 10 years as Boden professor. His main scholarly interests were in philology (the study of language in written historical sources), but he also studied Buddhism, Jainism, philosophy, logic and myth. He also helped produce the standard translation of Harshacharita, a 7th- century Sanskrit biography. - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  align=\\"center\\"1937‚Äì42 New College Balliol After winning the Boden scholarship, Johnston served in the Indian Civil Service from 1909 to 1924, acquiring a knowledge of Indian language and culture which he improved on his return to England. He also learnt some Tibetan and Chinese to use sources in those languages. His writings drew upon his practical knowledge of Indian life. His main work was an edition and translation of Buddhacarita (\\"Acts of the Buddha\\") by the 2nd-century author A≈õvagho·π£a, published between 1928 and 1936. As Boden professor, he helped to catalogue the Bodleian Library's Sanskrit manuscripts and to improve the Indian Institute's museum. The Times described his death as \\"a heavy loss ... to Sanskrit studies everywhere.\\" - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  align=\\"center\\"1944‚Äì76 Christ's College, Cambridge, and the School of Oriental Studies, London Balliol Burrow studied classics and oriental languages at Cambridge, spending one year of his doctorate (on Prakrit, a language from central Asia) in London. After two further years of research in Cambridge, he was assistant keeper in the Department of Oriental printed books and manuscripts at the British Museum for seven years, where he studied Dravidian languages, which thereafter was his main area of research and publication. As Boden professor, he taught Sanskrit, Pali and Prakrit; according to his successor, Richard Gombrich, Burrow may never have set any of his students the task of writing an essay. On field trips to India, he helped to record previously unstudied Dravidian languages. Gombrich described him as \\"amiable but socially passive and taciturn\\", and as \\"a single-minded scholar of great learning\\". - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  align=\\"center\\"1976‚Äì2004 Magdalen College and Harvard University Balliol Gombrich, the son of the art historian Sir Ernst Gombrich, was a Fellow of Wolfson College and university lecturer in Sanskrit and Pali from 1965 to 1976, when he was appointed to succeed Thomas Burrow. On his retirement in 2004, he helped to establish the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies, an institution affiliated to the university. He was its first academic director (2004‚Äì09) and thereafter was appointed its President. He served as general editor of the Clay Sanskrit Library. His writings include Buddhist Precept and Practice (1991), How Buddhism Began (1996) and various journal articles on Buddhist and other topics. - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  align=\\"center\\"2005 onwards Harvard College, University of Delhi and Harvard University Balliol Minkowski obtained a diploma in Hindi from the University of Delhi and his PhD in Sanskrit and Indian Studies from Harvard.

She is best known as the founder of Miles Films, previously Miles Productions, which she co-manages with Indonesian filmmaker Riri Riza. Through Miles Films, she has produced several critically and commercially successful films, including Petualangan Sherina (Sherina's Adventure; 2000), Ada Apa dengan Cinta? (What's Up with Love?; 2002), Gie (2005), and Laskar Pelangi (The Rainbow Troops; 2008). Early life Lesmana was born in Jakarta to musician Jack Lesmana and his wife Nien. Her younger brother is jazz pianist Indra Lesmana. At the age of five, she entered kindergarten at Cikini School; her primary and middle school education were conducted at the same institution. As a child, Lesmana wanted to be either a scientist or detective, and was often at the top of her class. She later recalled that seeing George Lucas' Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (1977) \\"blew [her] off [her] feet\\" and may have inspired her to go into film making. At the age of 16, Lesmana wrote her first song, which her brother Indra used to gain a scholarship to a music school in Australia. As Indra was still a teenager, the family moved to Australia with him in 1979. Lesmana continued her education there; although she had previously studied English in Indonesia, she found difficulty with the Australian accent. She also started watching films regularly. After her second year in Australia, Lesmana transferred from a public school to the Australian International Independence School. After her graduation, the Lesmana family returned to Indonesia. She enrolled at the Jakarta Art Institute in 1983, graduating in 1985. Her first experience with film producing was a public service announcement made at the request of Garin Nugroho. On 14 February 1990, Lesmana married former teen idol, actor Mathias Muchus; the couple have two sons, Galih Galinggis and Kafka Keandre. Throughout the early 1990s Lesmana continued writing songs, including some for her brother and one for Chrisye's 1993 album Sendiri Lagi (Alone Again). In 1995 she established a film production company, Miles Productions, which was later renamed Miles Films. In 1996 she directed a successful documentary serial entitled Anak Seribu Pulau (Children of a Thousand Islands). Film career In 1999 Lesmana made her feature film debut with Kuldesak, which she co-directed with Riza Mantovani, Riri Riza and Nan Triveni. The following year she produced Petualangan Sherina (Sherina's Adventure). At the time, the Indonesian film industry was in decline, and several filmmakers ridiculed the efforts, saying that the films could not be profitable; both were nevertheless successful. In 2002 Lesmana released Ada Apa dengan Cinta? (What's Up with Love?), serving as co-producer with Riza. Iwan Setiawan, writing in The Jakarta Post, describes these films as having jump-started the industry's recovery. Mira Lesmana (left) with fellow director and producer Riri Riza in 2013 Lesmana produced Gie, a biopic of activist Soe Hok Gie, in 2005. Although a critical success, it did not break even. The following year Lesmana was a founding member of the Indonesian Film Society (), which worked to change censorship laws in the country. The group's petitions were ultimately unsuccessful. Also in 2006 she produced Garasi (Garage), a film starring Aries Budiman, Ayu Ratna, and Fedi Nuril. The cast reunited to form the band Garasi in 2007, which was one of the first acts signed to Lesmana's new recording company Miles Music. That year she produced 3 Hari Untuk Selamanya (3 Days for Forever); the film's soundtrack was produced by Float, another band on Miles Music. In 2008 Lesmana produced the film Laskar Pelangi (Rainbow Troops), an adaptation of Andrea Hirata's 2007 novel of the same name. That same year she continued to pressure for new film censorship laws, which ended with the government passing a new law in 2009. The following year she produced Sang Pemimpi (The Dreamer), a sequel to Laskar Pelangi based on the novel of the same name. In 2010 Lesmana wrote twenty songs for a musical stage adaptation of Laskar Pelangi, a project that also involved Erwin Gutawa, Jay Subiyakto, and Hartandi. Atambua 39¬∞ Celsius, a film about refugees who live in Atambua, commenced filming in 2012. The film was partially funded through crowd-funding and had its world premiere at the Tokyo International Film Festival. The following year, she released Sokola Rimba which won Best Film at the Maya Awards. Lesmana‚Äôs most expensive production to date was Pendekar Tongkat Emas (The Golden Cane Warrior; 2014), a martial arts film directed by Ifa Isfansyah. Starring Eva Celia, Nicholas Saputra, and Reza Rahadian, it had an estimated budget of 25 billion rupiah. In 2016, Lesmana produced Ada Apa dengan Cinta? 2 (What's Up with Love? 2;), a sequel to Ada Apa dengan Cinta. Like its predecessor, the film was a hit with audiences, and as of June 2016 had been watched by more than 3.6 million people. Also in the same year, Lesmana released Athirah (Emma' (Mother)), a film inspired by the life of Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla‚Äôs mother. The film won both the Citra Award and Maya Award for Best Film and had been screened at several international film festivals to positive reviews.

He designed the body, engine, chassis, suspension and fully engineered the Aston Martin DBR1, winner of the 1959 24 Hours of Le Mans. Early life Brian Clayton & Ted Cutting (cap) testing with DP215 in 1962/3 at Chalgrove a disused RAF airfield Cutting was born in Clapham, London and educated at Kingston Technical School. Career Cutting began his career aged 15 as a draughtsman with the KLG spark plug company. In 1946 he joined the Allard Motor Company where he designed his first complete car and in 1949 moved to Aston Martin. On joining Aston Martin he took part in the DB2 re- design and worked with Eberan von Eberhorst on DB3, DB3S and DP Lagonda V12 cars. In 1955 became Chief Designer for racing cars, producing the DBR1, DBR2 and DBR3 sports racing cars and the DBR4 and DBR5 Formula One cars. In 1961 he became Chief Designer for the Company with Tadek Marek the Chief Engineer and Harold Beech the Technical Director, all working together under John Wyer and ultimately David Brown. From 1962 as Chief Designer his Project racing cars DP212, DP214 and DP215 were conceived purely as prototype racing cars, particularly for long distance races, unique vehicles to gain maximum publicity. DP215 was recorded at on the Mulsanne Straight in practice at Le Mans and remains the fastest 6 cylinder front engine Aston ever made. After leaving Aston Martin in the early 1960s, he joined the Glacier Bearing Company designing large bearings for steam turbines and was named on Company patents. In 1966 he joined the Ford Motor Company as a race car design engineer and initially began work on the GT40 racing project with John Wyer at Advanced Vehicles in Slough. Circumstances changed so he was asked to join Ford of Britain in advanced chassis engineering at the beginning of the Capri project and then working through advanced pre-production on all car models up to the Granada, introducing many innovations along the way. During the latter stages of his career at Ford he was engaged in working at relationships within the Governments of Europe and The Common Market on the development international motor vehicle construction law. He remained with the company until his retirement in 1985. Retirement During retirement he was often engaged as a consultant on technical and legal matters including a return to Aston Martin advising Victor Gauntlett on several projects. As an automotive engineer he was extremely proud to have been made an associate member of the British Racing Drivers Club and a full Fellow of The Institution of Mechanical Engineers, he wrote many technical papers and automotive articles with lectures that were always informative and entertaining. In 2008 Stuart Bailey and Brian Joscelyne, both creative professionals and active members within the Aston Martin Owners Club, persuaded Cutting to verbally record his story and put the record straight for the Club archives, as he had been reluctant to write an autobiography. From these extensive audio tapes when transcribed, they formed the basis of a book covering eight decades, which once Cutting personally edited and gave access to his previously written articles, documents, illustrations and many original photos, a comprehensive book under his total control was produced, with his full consent to publish just prior to his demise. The 268 page book (self published), titled Cutting Edge Conversations includes a DVD of a full IMECHE lecture on Racing Astons in 2003 given by Cutting. The limited edition, heavy A4 volume is exclusive to the Aston Martin Heritage Trust.

French sources refer to her as Temaeva, and one Australian newspaper called her Te Maere, while her tombstone in Rimatara gives her name as Tamaeva. Biography Her father was King Tamaeva III of Rimatara, an island kingdom which also controlled the neighboring coral atoll of Nororotu (or √éles Maria), a claim it disputes with the neighboring kingdom of Rurutu. She was born during the period of westernization of the island and the Christian conversion of the islanders to the Protestant faith. Sources differ on her actual age and her date of birth, although it is certain that Tamaeva was only a teenager at the time of her death, which would place her birth in the early 1870s. Because of her youth and inexperience, her aunt Heimataura served as regent. She had a close relationship with the neighboring island of Rurutu, which was also ruled by an adolescent monarch, King Teuruarii IV. They would also share the same positions as the last independent rulers in the Austral Islands outside the sphere of French colonial control. Hearing reports that the neighboring Cook Islands had been declared a protectorate of the British, a nation considered more friendly than the French due to the islands' adherence to the Protestant faith, the queen decided to ally herself with Great Britain. On 27 November 1888, the monarchs of both islands visited Rarotonga to ask for British protection against further French aggression. They sent a formal petition to Queen Victoria seeking protectorate status for the two kingdoms. The request was ultimately refused.French Polynesia ‚Äì Britannica Online Encyclopedia The efforts of the two were in vain because the French responded immediately to what they presumed to be a threat to their interests in the Pacific. On 29 March 1889, the French warship Dives landed on Rimatara with the colonial governor of French Oceania, √âtienne Th√©odore Lacascade, on board, and he had Rimatara and √éles Maria declared a French protectorate.. The French version of the story was that the Queen and chiefs had personally petitioned Governor Lacascade to take over the islands, but British sources believed the whole affair to be largely contrary to the desire of the majority of the islanders. As a sign of the newly declared protectorate, the French tricolor was added to the canton of the kingdom's flag in 1891. In 1892, French Protestant missionary Fr√©d√©ric Vernier of the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society described Queen Tamaeva as \\"a girl of sixteen or seventeen years\\". During his stay, he witnessed the restoration and reopening of the church in the capital, Amaru, which was celebrated with much fanfare. She died on 12 November 1892 and was succeeded by her aunt who reigned as Tamaeva V. Her remains were interred in the Royal Sepulchre at the Cemetery of Amaru, outside the settlement facing the sea; she was laid to rest beside other members of the Tamaeva royal line.

His appearances for Glamorgan were limited in his capacity as a full-time school teacher. Before World War I, his teaching commitments limited his appearances in the Minor Counties Championship to just seventeen.

Cording assisted Glamorgan for two further seasons, making eighteen further first-class appearances, the last of which came against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane, Sheffield. In his nineteen first-class appearances, he scored a total of 498 runs at an average of 16.60, with a high score of 101. This score, which was his only first-class century, came against Worcestershire at St Helens, Swansea, in 1921.

The Corporation had the task of growing the ancient Sussex market town of Crawley from a population of 9,000 to 40,000 by the early 1960s, expanding its commercial and industrial base and developing a balanced, socially cohesive community. A master plan supplied by planning consultant Anthony Minoprio would guide the Corporation's work. The \\"energy and enthusiasm\\" of its chairman Thomas Bennett helped it meet many of its targets early, and it was formally dissolved in 1962. Its assets passed to the Commission for New Towns in that year; they are now owned privately or by the local authority, Crawley Borough Council. The Corporation was based at Broadfield House, a 19th-century villa in the south of the town. Professionals and specialists from many fields were employed: architects, engineers, designers, legal and financial experts were all involved during its 15-year existence. A committee headed by Bennett took overall charge. Wide-ranging powers were granted‚Äîfrom physically preparing the land to examining financial contracts‚Äîand in return the Corporation was expected to transform the \\"designated area\\" into a viable regional centre and community. Problems faced by the Development Corporation included labour and materials shortages, a lengthy legal battle against the designation order, the resignation of the original master plan designer, complaints from residents about its far-reaching powers (including some high-profile challenges), and the position of the designated area across the boundaries of several local authorities, making negotiations more complex. Nevertheless, the Corporation was able to drive the New Town's rapid postwar growth and transformation; population targets were regularly revised upwards because of Crawley's success in attracting people and jobs, and the town now houses 100,000 people. History =Background= The public inquiry into Crawley's New Town designation took place at the Montefiore Institute in November 1946; meanwhile, the committee which became the Development Corporation had already been formed. By the early 1930s, the market town of Crawley and the adjacent villages of Ifield and Three Bridges were beginning to merge, and low-quality ribbon development stretched into the surrounding countryside towards Tinsley Green and the new Gatwick Aerodrome, northwards along the London Road and west of Ifield towards Horsham. This was of great concern to West Sussex and East Sussex county councils, and the national government was also aware of the problem. After the Town and Country Planning Act 1932 extended the scope of urban planning in the United Kingdom, a group of people representing various local and wider interests began to meet regularly in Crawley with the aim of improving the area's future development. As their influence grew, they successfully argued for Crawley to be governed by a single local authority: until that time, 1945, the area was controlled by three county councils and three parish councils. Meanwhile, the national government was making several proposals which together paved the way for the concept of New Towns. The Barlow Commission (1940) argued for the mass movement of people and jobs from cities to new satellite towns; the Scott Committee (1941) specified more details about how such towns should develop; and the Uthwatt Committee (1942) discussed how land and buildings could be compulsorily purchased. Patrick Abercrombie's Greater London Plan of 1944 proposed taking 1 million residents out of London. One third were to be rehoused in ten new towns in a ring about from the city. In 1945, Lord Reith and his committee described how these towns would be developed: they were intended to be \\"self-contained and balanced communities for work and living\\". Following the passing of the New Towns Act 1946 in April of that year, sites had to be found: two locations south of London (Crowhurst and Holmwood, both in Surrey) were rejected, and the Minister of Town and Country Planning Lewis Silkin selected Crawley as the site for a \\"twin-centred town [... with] an eventual population of 30,000 to 40,000\\". On 10 July 1946, Silkin met officers from the various local authorities that governed the Crawley area. He explained his choice of Crawley as a New Town; no objections were raised in the meeting, but the mood from some groups and members of the public was less enthusiastic and a public inquiry had to be held. The proceedings, on 4‚Äì6 November 1946 at Montefiore Hall in Three Bridges, held up the official New Town designation until 9 January 1947, and two further legal challenges meant no work could take place until December 1947. =Creation of the Corporation= In October 1946, Lewis Silkin set up an informal committee to run the affairs of the proposed Crawley New Town. In February 1947, shortly after the official designation of New Town status, the group was formalised and renamed Crawley Development Corporation. It had to \\"design, build and administer a self-contained industrial town of 50,000 within 15 years, and weld this on to the existing scattered haphazard development\\" around Ifield, Crawley and Three Bridges. It was permitted to compulsorily purchase any land or property within the \\"designated area\\", employ any staff it needed to carry out professional, administrative and clerical duties, and subcontract building and other manual work if it preferred not to employ such workers directly. The national government would finance it as required through 60-year loans. In return, the Corporation would have to build residential, industrial, commercial, civic and service buildings and all the infrastructure needed for the new town: electricity (including street lighting), gas, water, drainage and sewerage, and new road connections. It would be responsible for all the houses it built, in terms of both maintenance and finance: it could provide subsidies and charge rents as it saw fit. Governance was outside the Corporation's remit: Crawley Urban District Council, created in 1956 to cover the whole of the designated area, was responsible for matters of local governance. Before the creation of this single local authority, parts of the New Town area were controlled by Horsham Rural District Council (in West Sussex), Cuckfield Rural District Council (East Sussex) and Dorking and Horley Rural District Council (Surrey). When the Corporation was created in February 1947, its chairman was Sir Wilfred Lindsell. He asked town planner Thomas Wilfred Sharp to prepare a draft master plan, which he delivered on 1 March 1947. Within months, both men had left the Corporation: Lindsell was considered \\"not dynamic enough\\" by Lewis Silkin, and Sharp resigned shortly after submitting his plan and some additional research. Local historian Peter Gwynne described this as \\"an extraordinary decision [...] which was never properly explained\\". Anthony Minoprio was appointed as consultant planner instead; by June 1947 he had prepared a new draft plan (approved and published in December 1947) and Silkin had taken on a new chairman, Thomas Bennett. Also in 1947, the Corporation acquired Broadfield House. Originally a 19th-century villa in extensive grounds, the building was used as a country club until its closure in that year. The Corporation had already decided to operate temporarily from London while searching for suitable premises in Crawley, rather than building new offices. When the building came on the market in late 1947, the Corporation bought it, refitted it and on 23 August 1948 opened it as its headquarters. Ancillary buildings were put up in the grounds in mid-1949. =Crawley New Town develops= the West Green neighbourhood was the first residential street built by the Development Corporation. Under Bennett's chairmanship, the Development Corporation consisted of about 90 employees led by a committee of unelected members: Bennett himself, Sir Edward Gillett, Caroline Haslett, Ernest Stanford, Lawrence Neal, E.W. Passold, D. Bolton, Mr Lewis and Alderman James Marshall. Each had a specialism: Bennett was an architect, Gillett a surveyor, and Lewis (a former Barclays Bank chairman) looked after the financial side; Marshall had been Mayor of Croydon, Bolton once led London County Council, and Stanford chaired Crawley Parish Council. Dame Caroline Haslett, educated locally, was a pioneering electrical engineer and writer, and was the British Electricity Authority's first female member. The technicians, surveyors, architects and other professionals employed by the Corporation were organised by Colonel C.A.C. Turner, its chief executive until 1959. Delays caused by materials shortages in the straitened postwar economy meant that the first two years of its existence were given over to planning, but work began in earnest in 1949. Minoprio updated his draft plan, and the Corporation signed off A Master Plan for Crawley New Town in early 1949. The new town's chief architect until May 1952, when he left to become City Architect of Birmingham, was Alwyn Sheppard Fidler. Throughout 1948, planning took place for the industrial estate, the town centre and the first residential neighbourhood, West Green. Minoprio took charge of the detailed planning of the new town centre, to be based on the existing High Street, while responsibility for the other areas was devolved to Development Corporation staff. In the same year, work started on the sewerage system and New Town's industrial estate (later named Manor Royal), and the first residential street was built. The Corporation looked at bids from 11 companies for the contract to lay out and build Smalls Mead, a street of terraced houses near Crawley Hospital. Early problems included design mistakes in some of the houses, lack of accommodation for builders and inadequate supplies of materials (rationing was still in place, and New Towns received no preferential treatment), but the 34 houses, built by the Hoad and Taylor company for ¬£45,220, were ready by the end of the year. The Corporation \\"intended to preserve the character of the High Street as far as possible\\" when building the new town centre. A site was designated, consisting of open fields off the Three Bridges Road and the ancient High Street at the west end. Nevertheless, it caused controversy and faced challenges to its plans. It used its compulsory purchase powers to buy 76 shops and other buildings on and near the High Street in 1950 and immediately leased them back to their previous owners for 21 years. This bred insecurity, as business owners could be forced to leave at short notice; some compulsorily purchased shops were, however, never demolished. An impassioned statement to the Corporation by Daisy Warren, a hardware shop owner, was widely publicised at the time. Meanwhile, the compensation policy for farmland bought by the Corporation and reclassified as building land was causing frustration among landowners. The government- sanctioned policy allowed the Corporation to profit from its acquisitions. When land was bought east of the High Street in preparation for the new town centre, farmer James Lee took direct action: he built his activist profile by occupying and being evicted from several farms in quick succession, then he became nationally famous for driving his tractor from Crawley to Buckingham Palace as a protest at being \\"cheated\\" by the Corporation. Provision of housing by the Corporation Most of the Corporation's housing stock consisted of \\"Group I\\" houses. Many were terraced or semi-detached, as here at Paddockhurst Road in Gossops Green. Few flats were built by the Development Corporation; the Sunnymead flats in West Green were among the first. From the time it was established, one of Crawley Development Corporation's main aims was to house former Londoners who were moving to work in the New Town. The master plan aimed to build nine self-contained residential neighbourhoods (later increased to ten, and with three more added since) which would be \\"small socially mixed residential areas, each with [their] own individuality and [their] own centre, in order to promote neighbourliness and the social development of the town\\". As far as possible, the new housing was to be fitted round the existing development in Three Bridges, Crawley and Ifield, which by the time of Minoprio's report consisted of about 2,600 houses. The Corporation carried out a survey of the local housing stock in 1947. As early as 1946, the government was insistent that Crawley New Town should be predominantly for people moving out of substandard housing in London. In a report that year, Lewis Silkin stated that East and West Sussex County Councils would have to make their own provision for housing for tenants on their waiting lists. The main qualification for a Crawley Development Corporation house was proof of employment in Crawley, so the Corporation's provision of housing was closely linked with its early and rapid development of the Manor Royal industrial estate. Local people who had longstanding links with the Crawley area were disappointed with the Corporation's inability to build houses for them, and this continued to be a problem throughout the Corporation's existence. The county councils and rural district councils (and later, the Urban District Council) provided some new houses when they could, as they had before the New Town existed. To meet Minoprio's plans for a balanced community, several types of housing were designed by the Development Corporation's architects between 1947 and 1949. Group I (\\"Housing Manual Standard\\") houses were to form 80% of the town's housing stock. They would mostly be terraced, with some semi- detached houses; designs with between one and five bedrooms were produced; and they would all be for rent only. Group II (\\"Intermediate Standard\\") houses would make up 15% of the New Town's accommodation. Mostly semi-detached, they would be for rent or for sale at ¬£2,000 to ¬£2,500. Group III houses would be larger detached properties for managers and executives. Most would be sold at between ¬£3,000 and ¬£5,000, but again some could be rented. From mid-1949, 105 Group I houses were put up in the first New Town neighbourhood, West Green, and over the next year work began on houses from all three categories. Variation in design and style was encouraged by the Corporation, but it had the power to vet and approve all designs and could also allow outside architects to provide them. Overall, this central approval process brought about homogenisation: \\"most of the houses in the town are characteristic of public housing of the 1950s\\", featuring red-brick walls, exterior cladding, tiled roofs of varying steepness, and occasional use of concrete. The Corporation planned to build more low-rise flats than were eventually provided: there was intended to be an 85%‚Äì15% split between houses and flats, but this was revised downwards because most incoming Londoners asked for houses. The two earliest neighbourhoods, West Green and Northgate, have the most flats. Houses were built as part of carefully planned self-contained neighbourhoods. The master plan included nine: four adjacent to the town centre and inside an inner ring road and five beyond this. The Corporation completed the construction of all nine (although the ninth, Gossops Green, was unfinished as at 1962), and started work on a tenth. The inner neighbourhoods were West Green (built 1949‚Äì54), Northgate (1951‚Äì55), Three Bridges (1952‚Äì55) and Southgate (eastern part 1955‚Äì57; the western section was delayed until after the Development Corporation era). Langley Green, the first of the outer ring of neighbourhoods, was built in 1952‚Äì56; Pound Hill was partly built up in 1953‚Äì56; Ifield dates from 1954 to 1957; Tilgate was developed between 1955 and 1958; and Gossops Green dates from 1956 to 1961. Land east of Tilgate that was designated in the master plan as \\"reserve residential\\" was laid out with utilities from 1960; the Corporation had erected about 500 houses in the neighbourhood, named Furnace Green, by the time of its dissolution. The Corporation aimed to act responsibly in its provision of housing. It tried to ensure that two neighbourhoods were under construction at all times so that new residents did not all have to life in the same part of town. Corporation staff visited new residents to ensure they were adapting to live in their new houses. Houses and roads were sympathetic to the topography of the area where possible: old trees were kept, streets followed the lie of the land and houses were set back behind grassed areas or placed at an angle. People moving from London often wanted to move several generations of their family to Crawley; so bungalows and (from the 1960s) old people's homes were provided. The Corporation succeeded in its aim of moving people out of London: by 1966, when the population was about 60,000, 73% of residents had moved from the city in the last 20 years. Only 11% were long-term Crawley residents who already lived in the town in 1947. Its intention of ensuring a balanced social mix in each neighbourhood, by building houses of various grades and statuses in close proximity, was less successful: some neighbourhoods have developed distinct characters, such as middle-class (Pound Hill) and working-class (Langley Green). Provision of industry and employment by the Corporation The Corporation built many factories to a standard design in the 1950s on the Manor Royal industrial estate. Jobs as well as people were to be moved out of London to the New Towns, and another of Crawley Development Corporation's main tasks was to select firms that were suitable to be moved to the town. This needed to be done quickly to ensure varied employment was available for the thousands of new residents: the government wanted people to live and work in Crawley rather than commuting out to London or elsewhere. Companies were encouraged, not forced, to relocate: the Corporation attempted to provide excellent conditions for industry to thrive, such as a well laid out (and in its own words \\"unusually attractive\\") industrial estate, good transport links and a range of factory sizes. About two years (1947‚Äì49) were spent on designing the Manor Royal estate. The policy succeeded: hundreds of London- based companies asked to move, and the Corporation was able to select the most suitable to ensure a range of industries and company sizes. It tried to prevent any single trade becoming dominant, and was partly successful; but Crawley did develop into a centre for the electronics and engineering industries, and by the late 1950s one in ten of the town's workers were employed by the A.P.V. Company (previously based in Slough and Wandsworth, and specialising in large machinery and metalworking). About of land in the north of the designated area was devoted to industry in the masterplan, and more land was held in reserve east of the London‚ÄìBrighton railway line. The site was close to the stations at Gatwick and Three Bridges; there was space for sidings and goods facilities; major roads were nearby; and the prevailing southwesterly winds would keep pollution away from residential areas. The Corporation built small factories to a standard design from 1950, and also offered custom-designed larger units for major companies. Land was also offered on a leasehold basis to firms if they wanted to build their own premises. Factories of different sizes were planned to be distributed throughout the Manor Royal estate, although in reality larger factories tended to cluster near the main roads. Commercial development was slow during the Development Corporation era. There was only of office space by 1962, when the Commission for New Towns took over responsibility; in the next three years, office accommodation increased sixfold. Early corporate headquarters included the Westminster Bank's administration centre in Station Way (1963). All office space completed by the Corporation passed to the control of the Commission for New Towns in 1962. =Gatwick Airport= By 1964, soon after the Corporation's dissolution, the industrial estate about supported about 16,000 jobs: the master plan had anticipated half that number. Labour shortages were frequent. From the 1960s, these were exacerbated by competition from the reopened and greatly enlarged Gatwick Airport, which stood next to the industrial estate and which offered high wages for semi-skilled and unskilled jobs‚Äîa threat anticipated by Thomas Bennett in the 1950s. In the 1940s and early 1950s, the Corporation expected no development to take place at the modest aerodrome, and even stated in September 1949 that it expected it to be decommissioned as an airport. In 1950, though, the government announced that it would be redeveloped as London's second airport; the Corporation retreated on its initial opposition‚Äîbased principally on the effect the airport would have on local industry‚Äîand the scheme was agreed in 1954. The aerodrome closed between 1956 and 1958, and was extended and rebuilt as an international airport. One of the Corporation's last acts was to build hundreds of cheap houses for airport workers. Provision of utilities and services by the Corporation The Development Corporation led the way in establishing the Weir Wood Reservoir, which serves the town's water needs. Crawley Development Corporation assumed responsibility for several public services in the town, and made an extensive study of its requirements in 1947‚Äì48. One of its conclusions was that every service would need to be provided at town, not neighbourhood, level. On 20 November 1948, the Ministry of Health designated the Corporation as a local water authority, and its chief engineer was put in charge of drainage provision. Working with other local water authorities, it established the Weir Wood Joint Water Board with the aim of building a large reservoir near Forest Row. Weir Wood Reservoir opened in 1954 and continues to supply Crawley's water needs. The Corporation also became a designated sewage authority on 2 April 1948, and used land it bought at Roll's Farm near Tinsley Green (one of its first actions after its creation in 1947) to build a sewage works which became operational in 1952. Crawley Urban District Council took over the Corporation's responsibilities in 1961. Electricity provision was the responsibility of parish councils and local electricity providers such as SEEBOARD, but the Development Corporation set up a committee to bring them all together and ensure the town's needs were met efficiently. It also provided all street lighting in the town, and undertook a study into a concept called \\"whole-town heating\\" which had been tried in Stevenage, Britain's first postwar New Town. The master plan made provision for a new hospital to replace Crawley Hospital in West Green. Despite support from the Corporation and Crawley Urban District Council, the regional health authority decided that the existing hospital should be extended and modernised instead. The Corporation had no responsibility for health clinics: these were built by West Sussex County Council, as were the police and fire stations. Later years and dissolution In 1959, the Corporation's chief executive Colonel Turner left. A year later, Thomas Bennett‚Äîwho with his \\"enthusiasm and energy ... left his stamp on the town\\"‚Äîresigned. Within 13 years, he had carried out his aim of turning Minoprio's master plan into reality. \\"Inflexible, dogmatic and highly successful\\", his influence ensured that the 15-year growth and other targets set in 1947 were met or exceeded. Few major projects remained, and the local council was able to take responsibility for the remaining needs of the developed community, which by the early 1960s had grown to 59,000 people. The New Towns Act 1959 created a national Commission for New Towns, whose responsibilities were similar to those of the original Development Corporations; accordingly in 1962, Crawley Development Corporation was wound up and the Commission acquired its assets. It was also granted some of the Corporation's former powers. The form and function of modern Crawley are closely linked with the Development Corporation's actions during its 15-year existence. The layout of the urban area conforms closely to the master plan, and Crawley's continuing status as an important regional commercial and industrial centre is attributable to the work done by the Corporation in attracting outside firms and providing suitable sites for them. Other aims have not been met so successfully. The Corporation originally aimed to define a firm boundary for the urban area, preventing additional development and preserving the green belt (whose extent was marked on the master plan). Since 1962, the original nine residential neighbourhoods have become 13 with the addition of Furnace Green, Broadfield, Bewbush and Maidenbower, and the rapid growth of Gatwick Airport from the late 1950s meant that more land was needed for its dependent industries. The airport, previously in Surrey, was brought within Crawley's boundary in 1974, extending the urban area northwards. Coat of arms Crawley Development Corporation was granted a coat of arms in 1951. Its official heraldic description is \\"Or, on a fesse gules between three crows sable, three chevronels interlaced argent, all within a bordure azure charged with sixteen martles or\\". The crows relate to the etymology of Crawley's name: by the 5th century, the area was known as Crow's Leah‚Äîa crow-infested clearing. The martlet, a mythical swallow-like bird with no feet, has been an emblem of Sussex since the 17th century or earlier. Elements from the coat of arms were used in some of the street names of the Broadfield neighbourhood when it was built in the 1970s.

This placed Hibbert in conflict with his own party leadership as he continued to argue his position during the campaign.\\"The Contest At Chorley.\\" Times [London, England] 15 Feb. 1913: 10. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 7 Mar. 2014. There was a large number of Roman Catholics among the electorate, thought to number up to 4,000. However, not many were Irish, so may not have been so automatically disposed to support for the Liberals Third Irish Home Rule Bill currently being passed by the House of Commons. The Unionists attempted to retain their support through their defence of the denominational schools system. The Liberals were considering introducing an education bill to enable the establishment of non-denominational schools.\\"The Issues At Chorley.\\" Times [London, England] 17 Feb. 1913: 8. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 7 Mar. 2014. About 2,300 trade union members were among the electorate. There was not a strong tradition of trade union support for the Liberals in this part of Lancashire. Liberal MP Clement Edwards a barrister with a history of working for the trade union movement, was leading a Liberal campaign to win over Lancashire trade unionism. He worked with a local trade union defence committee to get posters displayed that criticised the Unionist Party opposition to the Trade Unions (No.2) Bill.\\"The Issues At Chorley.\\" Times [London, England] 17 Feb. 1913: 8.

It was opened in 2004 and, with around 300,000 visitors per year ( 2008), is one of the most popular national park centres in Germany. Its aim is to provide information on the unique characteristics of the park while instructing visitors how to avoid damaging the ecology of the park. The centre offers an interactive exhibition, a multi-vision theatre, and other activities in the outdoor area. It is named after the nearby chalk cliffs of K√∂nigsstuhl. The operator of the centre is the Nationalpark-Zentrum K√∂nigsstuhl Sassnitz GmbH, whose members are the World Wildlife Fund of Germany and the town of Sassnitz.  History and creation of the centre  Because of the fascination of the imposing chalk rocks in the 19th century, there was an interest in creating visitor facilities in this location. In 1835, an inn was built in a wooden, Swiss style under the direction of Karl Friedrich Schinkel. After this building had burned down and been rebuilt several times, it was decided in 1893 to build a stone hotel which served as an inn and post office. This building still exists today and has part of the National Park Centre. During the Second World War, around 1943, the building was used as a hospital. Later, it was occupied by the Red Army. Even the East German navy (Coastal Border Brigade) used this building subsequently as a barracks. Other bunkers and a guard tower were erected on the site. In 1990, the East Germany's Council of Ministers, declared the area a national park. Until 1999, the area lay fallow and the buildings fell into ruins. In 2000, the guard tower and barracks (except one) were demolished. The World Wildlife Fund of Germany, the state of Mecklenburg- West Pomerania, and the town of Sassnitz founded a company, the Stubnitzhaus Sassnitz GmbH, to establish a nature information centre. In March 2004, the K√∂nigsstuhl National Park Centre was opened.  Objective  The West Pomerania National Park Authority is responsible for the Jasmund National Park. The staff of the National Park Authority work to protect the park and its visitors; they look after the visitor facilities (paths, steps, etc.) and visitor safety, as well as running environmental education projects. The K√∂nigsstuhl National Park Centre works in a complementary fashion to provide information and to engage visitors in the natural beauty of the park. A central focus of the Park Centre is to give visitors the opportunity to experience nature and to enjoy peaceful recreation, without nature suffering as a result. The Centre pursues a unified approach to environmental protection. Environmental protection is a factor in the recruitment of all staff, and also covers all aspects of the Center, such as its construction materials, the operation of the restaurant, and paper used for print media in the office.  Visitor services  = K√∂nigsstuhl observation platform = The viewing platform on the K√∂nigsstuhl Within the grounds of the National Park Centre is the K√∂nigsstuhl, one of the most impressive cliffs on R√ºgen's chalk coastline. On the top of the cliff is a viewing platform, accessible via a few steps. Below this platform is a protected passage grave dating from the Bronze Age. = Interactive exhibition = The 2,000-square-metre exhibition, with its theme of a \\"journey through time\\", starts in prehistoric times and has displays such as aquariums and an exhibit of an iceberg glacier. = Multivision cinema = A 180¬∞ film, projected onto four screens, provides a sense of the beauty of Jasmund National Park. Large-format photographs alternate with moving images, and produce a feeling of flying over the park. The actors are children from the island of R√ºgen. The snail-shaped auditorium seats about 70 visitors. The aim of the film is to raise awareness of Jasmund and the national park concept on an emotional level. = Outdoor area = An outdoor area of 28,000 square metres provides other attractions for children and adults, such as a climbing forest, a ground-nesting bird's nest with giant eggs, and an exhibition about the painting Chalk Cliffs on R√ºgen (Kreidefelsen auf R√ºgen) by the artist Caspar David Friedrich. = Walks = The park includes hiking trails and cycle paths. The National Park Centre offers free, guided walks. In addition, there are themed walks, which are based on the seasons.  Special features  = Disabled-friendly = The National Park Centre is wheelchair-accessible. Lifts allow disabled and wheelchair access to all rooms of the exhibition, all attractions in the outdoor area are wheelchair-accessible with the exception of the K√∂nigsstuhl, and the parking lot shuttle bus is low-platform. For blind visitors, \\"Jasmund, Chalk Cliffs by the Sea\\" (Nationalpark Jasmund, Kreidefelsen am Meer) is available in Braille. One region that is not accessible to wheelchairs is the passage grave. It sites immediately below the steps leading to the viewing platform and cannot be altered because structural changes would jeopardise the historic preservation of the grave. = Zero emission concept = The National Park Centre K√∂nigstuhl was designed as a zero-emission building. Power is supplied by a photovoltaic system. Since the Centre is located in one of the sunniest places in Germany, the plant can produce up to . A geothermal system was installed in the outside area of the National Park Centre to use the earth's warmth to extract energy for heating, air conditioning and hot water. New technologies have been utilised to promote the sustainable management of drinking water, and the drainage system is governed by a strict separation of waste water by its degree of pollution. Wastewater is discharged by gravity to a fat separator and then sent for pre-treatment at a sewage treatment plant. The cleaned water meets the standards of the EU Bathing Water Directive, and the purified water is used only for non-drinking purposes, such as flushing toilets.  Getting there / National park trails  The car park for the National Park Centre is at Hagen, which is about 3 miles from the K√∂nigsstuhl. Visitors continue to the park by shuttle bus or on a hiking trail. Other car parks are located in Sassnitz am Wedding and at the entrance to National Park next to Stubbenkammerstra√üe. The most important public road in the national park runs from Sassnitz via Hagen and Nipmerow to Lohme, and cuts through the park in a north-south direction. This road has a branch near the Hagen Tree House to Stubbenkammer and the National Park Centre. From 9:30 am‚Äì6:00 pm, this road is closed to general traffic. It is open only to cyclists, coaches, buses, disabled vehicles, delivery and refuse vehicles, and vehicles of the National Park Service. There are 4 descents from the clifftop path to the beach: wooden steps on the shore of the Hanke between Lohme and the K√∂nigsstuhl, by the K√∂nigsstuhl going towards the Victoria viewpoint (closed since the Wissower Klinken collapsed), on the Kieler Ufer, and at the Hengst. There are two other descents on the National Park boundary, one at Sassnitz am Wedding and the other in Lohme.

This very large aquatic beetle is found in the Palearctic and is known by the common name great silver water beetle.Karaouzas, I., et al. (2014). Contribution to knowledge of the distribution of the rare great silver water beetle Hydrophilus piceus (Linnaeus, 1758) (Coleoptera, Hydrophilidae) in Greece. Polish Journal of Entomology 83(2) 99‚Äì107. Description This beetle is among the largest aquatic insects. Adults can reach up to in length and in width. The larvae is up to long. The body of adults is black with a greenish or olive sheen. It has protruding eyes and reddish-black antennae. Biology museum specimen) Larvae This beetle lives in aquatic environments. In some regions it can be found in lakes and ponds. In Greece it can be found in lagoons and estuaries. It has been found at elevations of up to . In Great Britain it lives in ditches with thick vegetation in marshy areas. The beetle is omnivorous but favors plant material. It can live for up to 3 years but most individuals die after breeding during their first year. The larvae feed on freshwater snails of the family Lymnaeidae, drilling holes into the shells to feed on the animals. The grubs can then reach 7 centimeters long before pupating in the mud. In the spring, the adult female spins a cocoon, fills it with eggs, and sets it afloat. Distribution This beetle is native to the western Palearctic realm, where it occurs throughout much of Eurasia, its distribution extending from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean, North Africa, and Russia, and as far east as India and China. Its distribution is not continuous because it has been extirpated from some areas; it is considered to be extinct in Norway and Luxembourg, for example. It is rare in some regions, being found only in specific and relictual habitat types. References External links *Hydrophilus piceus.
