Within a few years, the Colony had housing, a forge, a warehouse, sawmill and wharf. In 1623, the Colony became the Province of Avalon when Calvert's grant was confirmed by King Charles I of England, growing to a population of 100 by 1625. Wynne was dismissed that year, probably because he lacked the skills to govern a growing Colony of that size and because Calvert himself wanted to govern the colony directly.

Taxonomy The Sri Lanka bush warbler has sometimes been placed in the genus Bradypterus and a 2018 study confirms that it is a sister to the clade that contains the Bradypterus and Megalurus warblers; it appears to be closely related to that genus, but differs in structure (relatively shorter-tailed and longer-billed), plumage (unmarked) and song. It is monotypic.http://ibc.lynxeds.com/species/sri-lankan-bush-warbler-elaphrornis- palliseri The species is named after the collector Captain Edward Palliser (1826-1907). Edward and his brother Fred Palliser were both collectors in Sri Lanka. The species was described by Kelaart but published by Edward Blyth in 1851. Distribution The Sri Lanka bush warbler is a bird of dense forest undergrowth, often close to water. It is found in the highlands of central Sri Lanka, usually above 1200 m. The nest is built in a shrub, and two eggs are laid. Description This is a medium-large warbler at 14 cm. The adult has a plain brown back, pale grey underparts, a broad tail and short wings. There is a weak supercilium, and the throat is tinged orange. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds lack the throat colouration. The Sri Lanka bush warbler is a skulky species which can very difficult to see. Perhaps the best site is Horton Plains National Park. It keeps low in vegetation, and, like most warblers, it is insectivorous. Males are often only detected by the loud song, which has an explosive queet.

In 1900 the vast majority of the Free Church of Scotland joined with the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland to form the United Free Church of Scotland (which itself mostly re-united with the Church of Scotland in 1929). The House of Lords judged that the minority continuing after the 1900 union were entitled to all the assets. While the denomination clearly had a starting date, in their own eyes their leaders had a legitimate claim to an unbroken succession of leaders going all the way back to the Apostles. The minority of the Free Church of Scotland who continued outside the union of 1900, retained the title the Free Church of Scotland. Origins Signing The Deed Of Demission Hugh Miller is at the end of the table taking notes leaning on his top hat. The Free Church was formed by Evangelicals who broke from the Church of Scotland in 1843 in protest against what they regarded as the state's encroachment on the spiritual independence of the Church. Leading up to the Disruption many of the issues were discussed in Hugh Miller's widely circulating newspaper The Witness. Robert Candlish was influential perhaps second only to Thomas Chalmers in bringing about the Disruption. The Disruption of 1843 was a bitter, nationwide division which split the established Church of Scotland. It was larger than the previous historical secessions of 1733 or 1761. The evangelical element had been demanding the purification of the Church, and it attacked the patronage system, which allowed rich landowners to select the local ministers. It became a political battle between evangelicals on one side and the \\"Moderates\\" and gentry on the other. The evangelicals secured passage by the church's General Assembly in 1834, of the \\"Veto Act\\", asserting that, as a fundamental law of the Church, no pastor should be forced by the gentry upon a congregation contrary to the popular will, and that any nominee could be rejected by majority of the heads of families. This direct blow at the right of private patrons was challenged in the civil courts, and was decided (1838) against the evangelicals. In 1843, 450 evangelical ministers (out of 1,200 ministers in all) broke away, and formed the Free Church of Scotland. Thomas Chalmers, the Free Church's first Moderator Dr. Welsh, the Church of Scotland's Moderator, who preached, read a Protest and walked out. Led by Dr. Thomas Chalmers (1780‚Äì1847), a third of the membership walked out, including nearly all the Gaelic-speakers and the missionaries, and most of the Highlanders. The established Church kept all the properties, buildings and endowments. The seceders created a voluntary fund of over ¬£400,000 to build 700 new churches; 400 manses (residences for the ministers) were erected at a cost of ¬£250,000; and an equal or larger amount was expended on the building of 500 parochial schools, as well as a college in Edinburgh. After the passing of the Education Act of 1872, most of these schools were voluntarily transferred to the newly established public school-boards.Stewart J. Brown, Thomas Chalmers and the godly Commonwealth in Scotland (1982)T. M. Devine, The Scottish Nation (1999) ch 16 Chalmers' ideas shaped the breakaway group. He stressed a social vision that revived and preserved Scotland's communal traditions at a time of strain on the social fabric of the country. Chalmers's idealised small equalitarian, kirk-based, self-contained communities that recognised the individuality of their members and the need for co-operation. That vision also affected the mainstream Presbyterian churches, and by the 1870s it had been assimilated by the established Church of Scotland. Chalmers's ideals demonstrated that the church was concerned with the problems of urban society, and they represented a real attempt to overcome the social fragmentation that took place in industrial towns and cities.S. Mechie, The church and Scottish social development, 1780‚Äì1870 (1960) Nature =Finances= before its own churches were built. The first task of the new church was to provide income for her initial 500 ministers and places of worship for her people. As she aspired to be the national church of the Scottish people, she set herself the ambitious task of establishing a presence in every parish in Scotland (except in the Highlands, where FC ministers were initially in short supply.) Sometimes land owners were less than helpful such as at Strontian, where the church took to a boat. The building programme produced 470 new churches within a year and over 700 by 1847. Manses and over 700 schools soon followed. This programme was made possible by extraordinary financial generosity, which came from the Evangelical awakening and the wealth of the emerging middle class. The church created a Sustentation Fund, the brainchild of Thomas Chalmers, to which congregations contributed according to their means, and from which all ministers received an 'equal dividend'. This fund provided a modest income for 583 ministers in 1843/4, and by 1900 was able to provide an income for nearly 1200. This centralising and sharing of resources was previously unknown within the Protestant churches in Scotland, but later became the norm. =\\"Send back the money\\" campaign= In their original fundraising activities the Free Church sent \\"missionaries\\" to the United States, where they found some slave- owners particularly supportive. However, the church having accepted ¬£3,000 in donations from this source, they were later denounced as unchristian by abolitionists. When Frederick Douglass arrived in Scotland he became a vocal proponent of the \\"Send back the money\\" campaign which urged the Free Church to return the ¬£3,000 donation. In his autobiography \\"My Bondage and My Freedom\\" Douglass (p. 386) writes: \\"The Free Church held on to the blood-stained money, and continued to justify itself in its position ‚Äî and of course to apologize for slavery ‚Äî and does so till this day. She lost a glorious opportunity for giving her voice, her vote, and her example to the cause of humanity ; and to- day she is staggering under the curse of the enslaved, whose blood is in her skirts.\\" Douglass spoke at three meetings in Dundee in 1846. In 1844, long before Douglass' arrival, Robert Candlish had spoken against slavery in a debate about a man named John Brown. In 1847 he is quoted as saying, from the floor of the Free Church Assembly: > \\"Never, never, let this church, or this country, cease to testify that > slavery is sin, and that it must bring down on the sinners, whether they be > in Congress assembled, or as individuals throughout the land, the just > judgement of Almighty God.\\" Not all American Presbyterians shared his anti-slavery view, although some did both in the north and the south. Presbyterian thinker B. B. Warfield regarded the integration of freed slaves as one of the largest problems America had ever faced. An official letter from the Free Church did reach the Assembly of the Southern Presbyterian Church in May 1847. The official Free Church position was described as being \\"very strongly against slavery\\". =Theology= New College, Edinburgh from Princes Street Gardens Great importance was attached to maintaining an educated ministry within the Free Church. Because the established Church of Scotland controlled the divinity faculties of the universities, the Free Church set up its own colleges. New College was opened in 1850 with five chairs: Systematic Theology, Apologetics and Practical Theology, Church History, Hebrew and Old Testament, and New Testament Exegesis. The Free Church also set up Christ's College in Aberdeen in 1856 and Trinity College in Glagow followed later. The first generation of teachers were enthusiastic proponents of Westminster Calvinism. For example, David Welsh was an early professor. James Buchanan followed Thomas Chalmers as professor of Systematic Theology when he died in 1847. James Bannerman was appointed to the chair of Apologetics and Pastoral Theology and his The Church of Christ volumes 1 and 2 were widely read. William Cunningham was one of the early Church History professors. John \\"Rabbi\\" Duncan was an early professor of Hebrew. Other chairs were added such as the Missionary Chair of Duff. This position was subsequently abandoned, as theologians such as A. B. Bruce, Marcus Dods and George Adam Smith began to teach a more liberal understanding of the faith. 'Believing criticism' of the Bible was a central approach taught by such as William Robertson Smith and he was dismissed from his chair by the Assembly in 1881. Attempts were made between 1890 and 1895 to bring many of these professors to the bar of the Assembly on charges of heresy, but these moves failed, with only minor warnings being issued. In 1892 the Free Church, following the example of the United Presbyterian Church and the Church of Scotland, and with union with those denominations as the goal, passed a Declaratory Act relaxing the standard of subscription to the confession. This had the result that a small number of congregations and even fewer ministers, mostly in the Highlands, severed their connection with the church and formed the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland. Others with similar theological views waited for imminent union but chose to continue with the Free Church. =Activity= Sea of Galilee Hospital. Opened in 1893 following work which originated with Robert Murray M'Cheyne and Andrew Bonar. The Free Church of Scotland became very active in foreign missions. Many of the staff from the established Church of Scotland's India mission adhered to the Free Church. The church soon also established herself in Africa, with missionaries such as James Stewart (1831-1905) and with the co-operation of Robert Laws (1851-1934) of the United Presbyterian Church, as well as becoming involved in evangelisation of the Jews. Her focus on mission resulted in one of the largest missionary organisations in the world. Preachers like William Chalmers Burns worked in Canada and China. Alexander Duff worked in India and can be seen behind Hugh Miller in the Disruption Painting signing Missions in Bengal. There were missions related to the Free Church and visited by Duff at Lake Nyassa in Africa and in the Lebanon. The early Free Church was also concerned with educational reform including setting up Free Church schools. Members of the Free Church also became associated with the colonisation of New Zealand: the Free Church offshoot the Otago Association sent out emigrants in 1847 who established the Otago settlement in 1848. Thomas Burns was one of the first churchmen in the colony which developed into Dunedin. The importance of Home Missions also grew, these having the purpose of increasing church attendance, particularly amongst the poorer communities in large cities. Thomas Chalmers led the way with a territorial mission in Edinburgh's West Port (1844- ), which epitomised his idea of a \\"godly commonwealth\\". Free churchmen were at the forefront of the 1859 Revival as well as of the Moody and Sankey's campaign of 1873‚Äì1875 in Britain. However, Chalmers's social ideas were never fully realised, as the gap between the church and the urban masses continued to increase. Towards the end of the 19th century, Free Churches sanctioned the use of instrumental music. An association formed in 1891 to promote order and reverence in public services. In 1898 it published A New Directory for Public WorshipCompare: which, while not providing set forms of prayer, offered directions. The Free Church took an interest in hymnology and church music, which led to the production of its hymnbook. Unions and relationships with other Presbyterians Timeline showing the evolution of the churches of Scotland from 1560 From its inception, the Free Church claimed it was the authentic Church of Scotland. Constitutionally, despite the Disruption, she continued to support the establishment principle. However some joined the United Presbyterian Church in calling for the Disestablishment of the Church of Scotland. In 1852 the Original Secession Church joined the Free Church; in 1876 most of the Reformed Presbyterian Church followed suit. However, a leadership-led attempt to unite with the United Presbyterians was not successful. These attempts began as early as 1863 when the Free Church began talks with the UPC with a view to a union. However, a report laid before the Assembly of 1864 showed that the two churches were not agreed as to the relationship between state and church. The Free Church maintained that national resources could be used in aid of the church, provided that the state abstain from all interference in its internal government. The United Presbyterians held that, as the state had no authority in spiritual things, it was not within its jurisdiction to legislate as to what was true in religion, prescribe a creed or any form of worship for its subjects, or to endow the church from national resources. Any union would therefore have to leave this question open. At the time this difference was sufficient to preclude the union being pursued. In the following years the Free Church Assembly showed increasing willingness for union on these open terms. However, the 'establishment' minority prevented a successful conclusion during the years between 1867‚Äì73. After negotiations failed in 1873, the two churches agreed a 'Mutual Eligibility Act' enabling a congregation of one denomination to call a minister from the other. During this period the antidisestablishmentarian party continued to shrink and became increasingly alienated. This decline was hastened when some congregations left to form the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland in 1893. Starting in 1895, union began to be officially discussed once more. A joint committee made up of men from both denominations noted remarkable agreement on doctrinal standards, rules and methods. After a few concessions from both sides, a common constitution was agreed. However, a minority in the Free Church Assembly protested, and threatened to test its legality in the courts. The respective assemblies of the churches met for the last time on 30 October 1900. On the following day the union was completed, and the United Free Church of Scotland came into being. However, a minority of those who dissented remained outside the union, claiming that they were the true Free Church and that the majority had departed from the church when they formed the United Free Church. After a protracted legal battle, the House of Lords found in favour of the minority (in spite of the belief of most that the true kirk is above the state) and awarded them the right to keep the name Free Church of Scotland, though the majority was able to keep most of the financial resources.

They ran a specific recruitment campaign to get Free Church ministers to go to New Zealand. Moderators in New Zealand included: *Gordon Webster (1898) Prince Edward Island, Canada, retains a number of Free Churches of Scotland affiliated with the Synod in Scotland as missionary churches.

The large enclave of Free Church of Scotland congregations has been attributed to a religious revival under the preaching of Rev. Donald MacDonald. The extant Church of Scotland congregations of Prince Edward Island, Canada, continue to adhere to a simple form of worship with a focus on a biblical exegesis from the pulpit, singing of the Psalms and biblical paraphrases without accompaniment or choir, led by a chanter, and prayer.

Geography There are several different landforms in the park that have taken millions of years to form, and give it a diversity not seen in any other national park in Canada. Sediment left by an ancient inland sea 500-200 million years ago had since become pressed into layers of rock. These layers were stacked about deep and are peppered with fossils, remnants of these ancient sea beds. As the continents shifted, the North American and Pacific Plates collided, the force of which pushed the layers of rock upwards. Ridges of rock bent and broke, leaving behind the ranges seen today. This same action also caused volcanic activity, sending molten lava into but not through the sedimentary rock. While there are no volcanoes in the park, towers of heated rock called igneous batholiths were sent upwards, pushing the sediment further up. The top layer of sedimentary rock was eventually eroded away, resulting in granite towers that form the Ragged Range. Over the last 2 million years, glaciers have covered most of North America, creating most of the land formations seen today. While previous ice ages affected the park area, the most recent, the Wisconsin Ice Age (85,000-10,000 years ago) touched only the most western and eastern parts of the park. This has left many geological features in the park much more time to develop than most of North America had. The central feature of the park is the South Nahanni River which runs the length of the park, beginning near Moose Ponds and ending when it meets the Liard River near Nahanni Butte. The South Nahanni is a rare example of an antecedent river. The mountains rose slowly enough, and the river was powerful enough that the river maintained its course over its history, meaning it has the same path today as it did before the mountains rose. As the river was meandering, the canyons it carved also meander. Most visitors only visit the portions from Virginia Falls (Nailicho) down. There are four main canyons that line the South Nahanni River, named by prospectors, numbering them as they travelled up the river. The fourth canyon, also called Painted Canyon or Five Mile Canyon due to its length, begins with Virginia Falls, and was created as the falls eroded the limestone surrounding the river, working its way upstream. Third canyon runs through Funeral Range, around long. Because its walls are composed of a stratum of shale, sandstones and limestone this canyon has long slopes instead of steep, flat walls like the lower canyons. Big Bend, a point where the river does a 45 degree turn, marks the end of Third and the beginning of Second Canyon. At long, it runs through the Headless Range. The final canyon is considered the most beautiful. Beginning after Deadmen Valley, First Canyon boasts the highest, most vertical walls, cutting through very resistant limestone. It ends near Kraus Hotsprings, making it about long. Following this, the river slows and braids into different channels, passing through the park boundary, and coming together again near the village of Nahanni Butte. Soon after the town, the South Nahanni River joins the Liard River. Notable mountains in the park include Mount Nirvana (), officially an unnamed peak, which at is the highest mountain in the Northwest Territories. Slightly further north lies Mount Sir James MacBrien (), the territories second highest peak at , and Lotus Flower Tower (, ) both of which form part of the Cirque of the Unclimbables (). Virginia Falls Virginia Falls and Mason's Rock At Virginia Falls or Nailicho in Dene (), the river plunges in a thunderous plume. Including the Sluice Box Rapids above the falls, it is more than twice the height of Niagara Falls. In the centre of the falls is a dramatic spire of resistant rock, called Mason's Rock after Bill Mason, the famous Canadian canoeist, author, and filmmaker. The falls were initially located downstream at the east end of Fourth Canyon, and over the centuries carved through the limestone rock that surrounds the river. This continuous erosion shifted the falls upstream and created the Fourth Canyon. Due to the mist, the immediate vicinity of the falls is home to several rare orchid species.Canadian Heritage Rivers System UNEP-WCMC Protected Areas Programme - Nahanni National Park There is a proposal to rename the falls after former Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre Trudeau. Downstream from the falls, there are many notable rapids on the river including Figure Eight, George's Riffle, and Lafferty's Riffle. Rabbitkettle Hotsprings Third Canyon, Nahanni River The Rabbitkettle (Gahn√Æhthah) Hotsprings and tufa mounds () are the largest of tufa mounds in Canada. The largest of the mounds, the North Mound, is high and across. The source of the springs comes from deep in the Earth's crust, near the base of the granite batholiths that form the Ragged Range. The volcanic activity that raised the mountains still heats the water deep below the surface of the Earth. The heated water percolates upwards, dissolving calcium carbonate from limestone deposits on its way by. When it reaches the surface springs, the water cools and the calcium carbonate particles are released. These microscopic particles settle to form porous calcite rims around the pools of water. These pools range in size from that of a bathtub to that of a fingernail. This process takes a great deal of time, and it is believed that the mounds themselves are around 10,000 years old, their creation beginning at the end of the last ice age. These rare and fragile features are protected as a Zone 1, Special Preservation Area, and all visitors must be accompanied by Parks Canada staff in order to minimize impact and visitors to the North Mound are required to be barefoot.Rabbitkettle hotsprings, Nahanni National Park Reserve, N.W.T.; a hydrogeological study. Flora and fauna The park's sulphur hot springs, alpine tundra, mountain ranges, and forests of spruce and aspen are home to many species of birds, fish and mammals. The park lies within three of Canada's ecozones, the Taiga Cordillera in the west, the Taiga Plains in the east and a small southern portion in the Boreal Cordillera.Nahanni National Park Reserve of Canada According to Parks Canada there are 42 mammal, 180 bird, 16 fish and a few amphibian species found in the park.Nahanni National Park Reserve of Canada Wildlife In the State of the Park Report 2009 the NWT government showed ten species that the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) had listed as special concern, threatened, or endangered that Nahanni National Park Reserve provides seasonal and year-round habitat for. These include common nighthawk, grizzly bear, olive-sided flycatcher, peregrine falcon, rusty blackbird, short-eared owl, wood bison, woodland caribou, wolverine and yellow rail. In addition the bull trout (Dolly Varden) and the Nahanni aster are listed but without a status and the Canada warbler and western toad are listed as possibly existing in the park.State of the Park Report 2009 Mammal species found in the park include; black bear, timber wolf, moose, shrew, vole, Arctic ground squirrel, marmot, mink, beaver, pine marten, lynx, snowshoe hare, river otter, muskrat, and red fox. Birds include the American kestrels, bald and golden eagles, loons, red-necked grebes, sharp-shinned hawks and trumpeter swans. It also includes the only known nesting site of the whooping crane. Fish found in the park include, Arctic grayling, burbot, inconnu, lake trout, lake chub, lake whitefish, longnose dace, longnose sucker, mountain whitefish, northern pike, round whitefish, slimy sculpin, spoonhead sculpin, spottail shiner and trout-perch. The diverse range of soils offers several specialized and uncommon habitats. More than 700 species of vascular plants and 300 species of both bryophytes and lichen can be found in the park, giving it a richer variety than any other area in the NWT. Nahanni aster is a very rare subspecies of aster found only in the Park. History The Gate, Second Canyon Mason's Rock in the centre of Virginia Falls The Dene, sometimes called Slavey, peoples have used the lands around Nahanni National Park Reserve for thousands of years. The first human occupation of the area is estimated to have occurred 9,000-10,000 years ago. Evidence of prehistoric human use has been found at Yohin Lake and a few other sites within the park. The local oral history contains many references to the Naha tribe, a mountain-dwelling people who used to raid settlements in the adjacent lowlands. These people are said to have rather quickly and mysteriously disappeared. First contact with European fur traders expanding into the region occurred in the 18th century, and was increased with Alexander Mackenzie's exploration of the Mackenzie River (Deh Cho), and building of trading posts at Fort Simpson and Fort Liard. At both of these John McLeod, a Scottish explorer of the area, was to serve as manager.Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography online During the 19th century, most Dene families left their nomadic lifestyles and settled into more permanent communities, often close to the trading posts. Permanent settlements were established at locations such as Nahanni Butte, Fort Liard and Fort Simpson. In the late 19th century, the Mountain Indians of the Nahanni region would travel down the Nahanni River each spring in mooseskin boats to trade the winter take of furs. These boats, based on the York boats used by the Hudson's Bay Company, were up to in length. Constructed from six to ten untanned moose hides sewn together and stretched over a spruce pole frame, these boats would transport entire families, their dogs and cargo of furs down the river during high water. Upon arrival the boat was dismantled and the hides traded along with the furs. Following a visit to the forts, these people would return to the high country with only what they could carry on their pack dogs. The stories of the Naha, and dangerous landscape that they inhabited, grew in stature with the Klondike Gold Rush as some explorers attempted to use the Nahanni as a path to the famous gold fields of the Yukon, or to try and make their fortune on the Flat and South Nahanni Rivers. Although no significant gold was found, legends of haunted valleys and lost gold emerged after the headless corpses of M√©tis prospectors Willie and Frank McLeod were found around 1908. The Lost McLeod Mine, a legendary lost mine somewhere in the park, is supposed to have been where the two brothers found their gold.Lost Bonanzas of Western Canada, Volume 1 by Garnet Basque In the years that followed, mysterious deaths of other prospectors added to the legends. The names of park features such as Deadmen Valley, Headless Creek, Headless Range and the Funeral Range, bear testimony to these stories and legends. In later years Albert Faille was a prospector in the area and met writer Raymond M. Patterson. The latter's works brought minor fame to Faille.Cultural Heritage In 1947 author Pierre Berton was sent by The Vancouver Sun to cover the north. He, along with pilot Russ Baker, flew up the Headless Valley. In 1964, explorer parachutist Jean Poirel from Montreal jumped at its source north of Yellowknife, followed by his teammate Bertrand Bordet. Jean Poirel imagined the idea of going down the river with inflatable dinghies. During the following four consecutive expeditions in the valley Jean Poirel discovered more than 250 caverns. The most important contained 116 Dall sheep‚Äôs skeletons (carbon-14 dated to 2500 years BC); Jean Poirel named it \\"Valerie Cavern\\" after his daughter. He took topographic notes and drew detailed maps, paving the way for the park's creation. During his last expedition in 1972, he escorted Pierre Trudeau, who came in person to evaluate this superb and fascinating region.Jean Poirel Explorateur Montr√©alaisAdventurer returns after 35 years to challenge the Nahanni =Park history= Originally established in 1972, by then Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau, the park was in area. The park was in \\"reserve\\" status pending settlement of outstanding Aboriginal land claims in the region.

In a novel form of cooperation between federal government and native groups, the Naha Dehe Consensus Team was formed in June 2000 by Canada and the Dehcho First Nations.Managing Nahanni Their original main tasks included: # prepare an Ecological Integrity Statement, # complete a review of the Park Management Plan, # prepare an Interim Park Management Arrangement, and # prepare a Memorandum of Understanding Respecting Park Expansion. In 2003, these were completed and the purpose of the team changed, now dealing with cooperative management issues, according to the Interim Park Management Arrangement, until the Dehcho Process is completed.Greater Nahanni Ecosystem On 9 June 2009 the Government of Canada, with the Dehcho First Nations, announced legislation that will increase the area of Nahanni National Park to cover , including 91% of the Greater Nahanni ecosystem in the Dehcho Region and most of the South Nahanni River watershed. The new park area is estimated to be the home of around 500 grizzly bears, two herds of woodland caribou, as well as species of alpine sheep and goats and other species. The new boundary will include the highest mountains and largest ice fields in the Northwest Territories. With the expansion of the park there have been several added designated landing sites. Because most access to the park is done by aircraft and air access is restricted in the park, there are set places aircraft can land. Before the expansion these were limited to Virginia Falls and Rabbitkettle Lake. Now there are five more: the Bunny Bar, Island Lake, Honeymoon Lake, Glacier Lake, and Seaplane Lake. However, only Virginia Falls and Glacier Lake are designated for day use visitation, meaning all other sites require visitors to stay overnight in the park.Parks Canada. 2010. Nahanni National Park Reserve of Canada Naha Dehe Management Plan. A visitor centre in Fort Simpson features displays on the history, culture and geography of the area. The park was among the world's first four natural heritage locations to be inscribed as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO in 1978. The South Nahanni River achieved Canadian Heritage River status in 1987. Presently around 800‚Äì1000 people visit the park every year, most of which are overnight visitors who travel down the South Nahanni. The park is open year-round, but most visitors come in June, July, and August. Virginia Falls is the only area of the park where a reservation is required, which must be done months in advance to prevent overcrowding. For safety reasons, all visitors must register with park officials upon entering the park boundaries, and deregister within 24 hours of leaving. There is a park office in Nahanni Butte at the end of the river, where visitors can deregister. The only practical way to get to Nahanni National Park is by floatplane or by helicopter, usually from Fort Simpson but other communities and locations offering a gateway into the park include: Watson Lake, Muncho Lake, Fort Nelson and Inconnu Lodge. Some people do hike in from the Nahanni Range Road at Tungsten to the west of the park. In 2007 the park was voted one of the Seven Wonders of Canada in a competition sponsored by CBC Television's The National and CBC Radio One's Sounds Like Canada.Final Online Results: The Seven Wonders of Canada The park was the subject of a short film in 2011's National Parks Project, directed by Kevin McMahon and scored by Shad, Jace Lasek and Olga Goreas. In fiction The area was featured in Sick Heart River, a fictional river in the Nahanni area, by John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir who was the Governor General of Canada. Buchan had not visited the Nahanni but had travelled down the Mackenzie and wanted to visit the area. The River, a book by Cheryl Kaye Tardif, is based on stories and legends from the area.

According to the 2016 Statistics Canada census, its population is 414.Population and dwelling counts Seventeenth century settlement Ferryland was originally established as a station for migratory fishermen in the late 16th century but had earlier been used by the French, Spanish, and Portuguese. By the 1590s it was one of the most popular fishing harbours in Newfoundland and acclaimed by Sir Walter Raleigh. Ferryland was called \\"Farilham\\" by the Portuguese fishermen and \\"Forillon\\" by the French‚Äîit later became anglicized to its current name \\"Ferryland.\\" (This should not be confused with the Forillon National Park in Quebec, which still keeps its French name.) The land was granted by charter to the London and Bristol Company in the 1610s and the vicinity became the location of a number of short-lived English colonies at Cuper's Cove, Bristol's Hope, and Renews and adjoined the colony of South Falkland. In 1620 the territory was granted to George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore who had obtained the holdings from William Vaughan. Calvert appointed Edward Wynne to establish a colony which became the first successful permanent colony in Newfoundland growing to a population of 100 by 1625. In 1623, Calvert's grant was confirmed and expanded. The Charter of Avalon was granted to Lord Baltimore by James I. Dated 7 April 1623 it created the Province of Avalon on the island of Newfoundland and gave Baltimore complete authority over all matters in the territory. That same year Baltimore chose Ferryland as the principal area of settlement. In the 1660s, the colony was attacked by the Dutch. The town was destroyed by New France in the Avalon Peninsula Campaign (1696). Virtually forgotten for centuries, excavations of the original settlement began in earnest in the late 1980s and continue to this day.Colony of Avalon Historic designations The site of the 17th-century Colony of Avalon was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1953. It was also designated a Municipal Heritage District in 1998. The Historic Ferryland Museum was designated a Municipal Heritage Site in 2006.

Many of his writings were too nicely adapted to the needs of his own day to justify the expectation that they would long survive it, but few men exercised more religious influence in their own generation, especially on young men. His sermon \\"The Greatest Thing in the World\\" remains popular in Christian circles.  Early life  Drummond was born at Park Place in Stirling, the son of William Drummond (d.1888) a seedsman and founder of Drummond Seeds, and his wife, Jane Campbell Blackwood (d.1910). His early education was at Stirling High School and Morrison's Academy. Drummond was educated at Edinburgh University, where he displayed a strong inclination for physical and mathematical science. The religious element was an even more powerful factor in his nature, and he entered the Free Church of Scotland. While preparing for the ministry, he became for a time deeply interested in the evangelizing mission of D.L. Moody and I.D. Sankey, where he was active for two years. Theologically, Drummond was significantly influenced by the Reveil movement in Reformed Protestantism.  Career  In 1877 he was lecturer on natural science in the Free Church College on Lynedoch Street in Glasgow, which enabled him to combine all the pursuits for which he felt a vocation. Drummond advocated for theistic evolution.Lightman, Bernard. (2010). Darwin and the Popularization of Evolution. Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London 64 (1): 5-24. His studies resulted in his writing Natural Law in the Spiritual World, the argument being that the scientific principle of continuity extends from the physical world to the spiritual. Before the book was published in 1883, an invitation from the African Lakes Company took Drummond to Central Africa. In 1880 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir Archibald Geikie, William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, John Gray McKendrick, and Sir Robert Christison. On his return in the following year he found himself famous. In 1884 he was a guest at Haddo House for a dinner hosted by John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair in honour of William Ewart Gladstone on his tour of Scotland. Large bodies of serious readers, among the religious and the scientific classes alike, discovered in Natural Law the common ground they needed; and the universality of the demand proved, if nothing more, the seasonableness of its publication. Drummond continued to be actively interested in missionary and other movements among the Free Church students. In 1888 he published Tropical Africa, a valuable digest of information.Review, Anti-Slavery Reporter, May‚ÄìJune 1888, p.82 In 1890 he travelled in Australia, and in 1893 delivered the Lowell Lectures in Boston. He had meant to keep them aside for mature revision, but an attempted piracy compelled him to hasten their publication, and they appeared in 1894 under the title of The Ascent of Man. Their object was to ratify altruism or, the disinterested care and compassion of animals for each other, important in effecting the survival of the fittest, a thesis previously maintained by philosopher Professor John Fiske.  Personal life  A bachelor, Drummond never married and had no children. In this late stage of his life he lived at 3 Park Circus in Glasgow.Glasgow Post Office Directory 1895-96  Death  Drummond's health failed shortly afterwards ‚Äì he had suffered from bone cancer for some years, and he died on 11 March 1897 whilst travelling in Tunbridge Wells. His body was returned to Holy Rude Cemetery in Stirling for burial with his parents. The grave, marked by a large distinctive red granite Celtic cross, stands just north-east of the church. In 1905 a medallion plaque to his memory was erected in the Free Church College in Edinburgh, sculpted by James Pittendrigh Macgillivray.

Negation normal form is not a canonical form: for example, a \\\\land (b\\\\lor \\\\lnot c) and (a \\\\land b) \\\\lor (a \\\\land \\\\lnot c) are equivalent, and are both in negation normal form. In classical logic and many modal logics, every formula can be brought into this form by replacing implications and equivalences by their definitions, using De Morgan's laws to push negation inwards, and eliminating double negations. This process can be represented using the following rewrite rules (Handbook of Automated Reasoning 1, p. 204): :\\\\begin{align} A \\\\Rightarrow B ~&\\\\to~ \\\\lnot A \\\\lor B  \\\\lnot (A \\\\lor B) ~&\\\\to~ \\\\lnot A \\\\land \\\\lnot B  \\\\lnot (A \\\\land B) ~&\\\\to~ \\\\lnot A \\\\lor \\\\lnot B  \\\\lnot \\\\lnot A ~&\\\\to~ A  \\\\lnot \\\\exists x A ~&\\\\to~ \\\\forall x \\\\lnot A  \\\\lnot \\\\forall x A ~&\\\\to~ \\\\exists x \\\\lnot A \\\\end{align} [In these rules, the \\\\Rightarrow symbol indicates logical implication in the formula being rewritten, and \\\\to is the rewriting operation.] Transformation into negation normal form can increase the size of a formula only linearly: the number of occurrences of atomic formulas remains the same, the total number of occurrences of \\\\land and \\\\lor is unchanged, and the number of occurrences of \\\\lnot may double. A formula in negation normal form can be put into the stronger conjunctive normal form or disjunctive normal form by applying distributivity. Repeated application of distributivity may exponentially increase the size of a formula. In the classical propositional logic, transformation to negation normal form does not impact computational properties: the satisfiability problem continues to be NP-complete, and the validity problem continues to be co-NP-complete. For formulas in CNF, validity problem is solvable in polynomial time, and for formulas in DNF, the satisfiability problem is solvable in polynomial time. Examples and counterexamples The following formulae are all in negation normal form: :(A \\\\vee B) \\\\wedge C :(A \\\\wedge (\\\\lnot B \\\\vee C) \\\\wedge \\\\lnot C) \\\\vee D :A \\\\vee \\\\lnot B :A \\\\wedge \\\\lnot B The first example is also in conjunctive normal form and the last two are in both conjunctive normal form and disjunctive normal form, but the second example is in neither. The following formulae are not in negation normal form: :A \\\\Rightarrow B :\\\\lnot (A \\\\vee B) :\\\\lnot (A \\\\wedge B) :\\\\lnot (A \\\\vee \\\\lnot C) They are however respectively equivalent to the following formulae in negation normal form: :\\\\lnot A \\\\vee B :\\\\lnot A \\\\wedge \\\\lnot B :\\\\lnot A \\\\vee \\\\lnot B :\\\\lnot A \\\\wedge C References * Alan J.A.

History The Avalon Peninsula was one of the first European-inhabited areas in North America. In 1497 the Bristol Guild of Merchants financed a voyage by John Cabot to Newfoundland, where he is reported to have landed at Cape Bonavista.\\"John Day letter to the Lord Grand Admiral, Winter 1497/8\\", The Smugglers' City, Dept. of History, University of Bristol Breton, Basque, and Portuguese fishermen spoke of \\"a land of codfish\\". They were familiar with the Avalon Peninsula where many would set up temporary shelters to dry fish. =The London and Bristol Company= In the early 17th century English merchants began to take an interest in the Newfoundland fishery. The Bristol Society of Merchant Venturers established the London and Bristol Company (the Newfoundland Company) in 1608 and sent John Guy, to locate a favourable location for a colony. The first permanent English settlement was established at Cuper's Cove in 1610. The company was granted a charter by James I on 2 May 1610 giving it a monopoly in agriculture, mining, fishing and hunting on the Avalon Peninsula. They retained exclusive rights until 1616 when the Crown began to grant lands to others. =Lord Baltimore= Sir George Calvert acquired a large land holding on the peninsula. and hired an agent Captain Edward Wynne to set up headquarters in Ferryland. The initial colony grew to a population of 100, becoming the first successful permanent settlement on Newfoundland island. In 1620 Calvert obtained a grant from Sir William Vaughan for all of the land that lay north of a point between Fermeuse and Aquaforte to as far north as Caplin Bay (now Calvert) on the southern shore of the Avalon Peninsula. In 1623, Calvert was given a Royal Charter extending the Royal lands and granting them the name the Province of Avalon \\"in imitation of Old Avalon in Somersetshire wherein Glassenbury stands, the first fruits of Christianity in Britain\\".Kevin Major, As Near to Heaven by Sea: A History of Newfoundland and Labrador, 2001, The charter created the province as a palatinate in which Calvert had absolute authority. Calvert wished to make the colony a refuge for Roman Catholics facing persecution in England. In 1625 Calvert was elevated to the Peerage of Ireland as The 1st Baron Baltimore. A series of crises and calamities led Calvert to quit the colony in 1629 for \\"some other warmer climate of this new world\\", which turned out to be Maryland, though his family maintained agents to govern Avalon until 1637, when the entire island of Newfoundland was granted by charter to Sir David Kirke and The 3rd Marquess of Hamilton (who was later created The 1st Duke of Hamilton). Lord Baltimore's son, Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, fought against the new charter, and in 1660 gained official recognition of the old Charter of Avalon, but never attempted to retake the colony. The site of the colony was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1953 It was also designated a Municipal Heritage District in 1998.

Its highest peak is Mount Olympus (), also known as Chionistra (), at , which hosts the Sun Valley and North Face ski areas with their five ski lifts. The Troodos mountain range stretches across most of the western side of Cyprus. There are many mountain resorts, Byzantine monasteries, and churches on mountain peaks, and nestling in its valleys and mountains are villages clinging to terraced hills. The area has been known since antiquity for its mines, which for centuries supplied copper to the entire Mediterranean. In the Byzantine period it became a centre of Byzantine art, as churches and monasteries were built in the mountains, away from the threatened coastline. The mountains are also home to RAF Troodos, a listening post for the NSA and GCHQ. The name Troodos probably comes from one of two sources: either + ( + ), referring to the three roads that lead to the mountain, or + + ( + + ), meaning the mountains of Adonis. Geology of Troodos Picture of a campsite in Troodos in 1900 Kalidonia river The Troodos mountains are known worldwide for their geology and the presence of an undisturbed ophiolite sequence, the Troodos Ophiolite. These mountains slowly rose from the sea due to the collision of the African and European tectonic plates, a process that eventually formed the island of Cyprus. The slowing and near-cessation of this process left the rock formations nearly intact, while subsequent erosion uncovered the magma chamber underneath the mountain, allowing a viewing of intact rocks and petrified pillow lava formed millions of years ago, an excellent example of ophiolite stratigraphy. The observations of the Troodos ophiolite by Ian Graham Gass and co-workers was one of the key points that led to the theory of sea floor spreading. Climate Churches Chapel of the Saint Mary near Klirou village Panagia Forviothissa in Asinou village The region is known for its many Byzantine churches and monasteries, richly decorated with murals, of which the Kykkos monastery is the richest and most famous.

He had a difficult probationary period, being refused by 23 churches. In 1864 he became minister of Renfield Free Church, Glasgow, where he worked for twenty-five years. In 1889 he was appointed professor of New Testament Exegesis in the New College, Edinburgh, of which he became principal on the death of Robert Rainy in May 1907. He became part of the United Free Church of Scotland on its formation in 1900, and in 1901 was elected Moderator of its General Assembly in 1902. He declined the position, stating that \\"he cannot see his way to undertake the duties\\". It was assumed he felt that being a neutral moderator, he would not be able to express his opinions on certain doctrinal points due to be discussed. In later life he lived with his children and grandchildren in a huge Georgian townhouse, 23 Great King Street, in Edinburgh's Second New Town.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory, 1905-6 On 26 April 1909, he died in Edinburgh. He was buried in the Dean Cemetery. The grave lies in the eastern part of the original north extension. He is buried with his wife and youngest son, Francis Palliser Dods (1879-1910). Family In 1871, he married Catherine Swanston (1844-1901), daughter of James Swanston. They had three sons and one daughter. Their eldest son, an advocate, was also named Marcus Dods. His sister Mary Frances Dods married the antiquarian Rev George Wilson of Glenluce. Works Throughout his life, both ministerial and professorial, he devoted much time to the publication of theological books. Several of his writings, especially a sermon on Inspiration delivered in 1878, incurred the charge of unorthodoxy, and shortly before his election to the Edinburgh professorship he was summoned before the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland, but the charge was dropped by a large majority, and in 1891 he received the honorary degree of DD from Edinburgh University. He edited Johann Peter Lange's Life of Christ in English (Edinburgh, 1864, 6 vols.), Augustine's works (1872‚Äì1876), and, with Alexander Whyte, Clark's Handbooks for Bible Classes series. In the Expositors Bible series he edited Genesis and 1 Corinthians, and he was also a contributor to the 9th edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica and Hastings' Dictionary of the Bible. He published a translation of Augustine's City of God in 1871.

The term is believed to be derived from the Old Norse , meaning 'to grumble or growl'. English cur In England the cur, also called the drover's dog, was a distinct breed of dog used by cattle drovers, they are now extinct. The cur was described by Ralph Beilby and Thomas Bewick in their 1790 work A general history of quadrupeds, as well as by Sydenham Edwards in his 1800 Cynographia Britannica, as dogs principally used by drovers to drive cattle. Curs were described as heelers, nipping the heels of cattle to make them move and ducking below the subsequent kick, they were said to be common in England, particularly the North of England, but were virtually unknown in the rest of the United Kingdom. The cur was described as being larger, stronger and longer legged than shepherd's collies with shorter and smoother coats; in colour they were generally black, brindled or grizzled with a white neck and legs and occasionally a white face, they had some feathering on their legs and half-pricked ears. A defining characteristic of the cur was many were born with short, stumpy tails, which gave the appearance of their having been docked. Edwards described the breed's ancestry as likely a mixture of collie, lurcher, English Mastiff or Great Dane. Their character was described as cunning, clever, ever busy and restless; it was said they could differentiate their master's cattle from those of strangers and they would separate the strange cattle from their master's herds. It is uncertain when or why the breed became extinct, it likely disappeared in the mid-19th century. Some modern writers believe it was the cur, not the collie, that was crossed with the dingo to create the now-extinct Halls Heeler in Australia, making the cur an ancestor of both the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog, the latter inheriting the cur's bobtail. American curs The Catahoula Leopard Dog, a recognized cur breed In the United States, the term cur is also used to describe a distinctive type of short-haired dog that is used for both hunting and herding, the type was developed in the Southern United States. When describing these dogs, the term is actually an abbreviation of cur-tailed, as in a dog with a naturally occurring bobtail like that of the extinct English cur; many of the earlier examples of this type had a bobtail and some still do. A number of cur breeds have been standardised within the United States, some have been recognised by the United Kennel Club; these breeds include the Black Mouth Cur, the Blue Lacy, the Catahoula Leopard dog, the Mountain Cur, the Stephens Cur, the Treeing Cur, and the Treeing Tennessee Brindle. These versatile dogs are used in a number of roles: for herding livestock, as well as trailing and locating lost livestock in thick scrubland; and in hunting a variety of game, including squirrels, opossums, raccoons, feral pigs, cougars, and American black bears, locating game both by sight and scent. While distinctive, American curs vary greatly in size; the various breeds and strains can be from in height, and in weight.

Personal life  Barbara Deming was born in New York City. She attended a Friends (Quaker) school up through her high school years. Deming directed plays, taught dramatic literature and wrote and published fiction and non-fiction works. On a trip to India, she began reading Gandhi, and became committed to a non-violent struggle, with her main cause being Women's Rights. She later became a journalist, and was active in many demonstrations and marches over issues of peace and civil rights. She was a member of a group that went to Hanoi during the Vietnam War, and was jailed many times for non-violent protest.Andrejkoymasky.com Deming died on August 2, 1984. = Relationships = At sixteen, she had fallen in love with a woman her mother's age, and thereafter she was openly lesbian. She was the romantic partner of writer and artist Mary Meigs from 1954 to 1972. Their relationship eventually floundered, partially due to Meigs's timid attitude, and Deming's unrelenting political activism. During the time that they were together, Meigs and Deming moved to Wellfleet, Massachusetts, where she befriended the writer and critic Edmund Wilson and his circle of friends. Among them was the Qu√©b√©cois author Marie-Claire Blais, with whom Meigs became romantically involved. Meigs, Blais, and Deming lived together for six years.Andrejkoymasky.com In 1976, Deming moved to Florida with her partner, artist Jane Verlaine. Verlaine painted, did figure drawings and illustrated several books written by Deming. Verlaine was a tireless advocate for abused women.  Life's work  Deming openly believed that it was often those whom we loved that oppressed us, and that it was necessary to re-invent non-violent struggle every day. It is often said that she created a body of non-violent theory, based on action and personal experience, that centered on the potential of non-violent struggle in its application to the women's movement. * Deming, Barbara: Prison Notes.

He served as president of the Royal Institute of British Architects from 1882 until 1884, and was knighted in 1886. His most recognised work, Tower Bridge, was completed posthumously. Biography Caversham Park Leadenhall Market Temple Bar Memorial Tower Bridge The son of David Jones, attorney, by Sarah Lydia Shephard, Jones was born at 15 Size Lane, Bucklersbury, London. He was articled to John Wallen, architect and surveyor, of 16 Aldermanbury, and subsequently in 1841-42 travelled to Italy and Greece studying ancient architecture.Dictionary of National Biography 1885‚Äì1900 In 1843 he commenced practice as an architect at 16 Furnival's Inn, Holborn. Beginning with Cardiff Town Hall (c. 1850-53) and Caversham Park (from c. 1850), he designed and carried out many buildings of importance, soon concentrating on London. He was surveyor for the Duke of Buckingham's Tufnell Park estate, for the Barnard estate, and the Bethnal Green estate. On 26 February 1864 he was elected architect and surveyor to the City of London, succeeding James Bunstone Bunning. Jones completed projects begun by his predecessor, such as the City Lunatic Asylum at Dartford, and was in charge of several renovations and additions to the Guildhall. He designed and built some of London's most famous markets, in particular Smithfield, Billingsgate and Leadenhall. He also designed the memorial at Temple Bar, replacing Wren's arch which was a notorious traffic obstacle. Jones' final legacy is one of the most recognised buildings in the world, Tower Bridge. It was designed in collaboration with the civil engineer John Wolfe Barry, who was brought in as an expert to devise the mechanism for the bascule bridge. Following Jones' death during the initial stages of construction, the execution lay in the hands of Barry. Jones became an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1842, a fellow in 1855 and served as the Institute's president from 1882 to 1883. He was knighted on On 30 July 1886. He was a freemason, and from 1882 until his death was Grand Superintendent of Works. Jones married Ann Elizabeth Patch, the daughter of John Patch, a barrister, on 15 April 1875. He died at 30 Devonshire Place, Portland Place, London, on 21 May 1887, and was buried in West Norwood Cemetery on 27 May.

Biographical details are almost entirely lacking, but like Cipriani he was brought, or attracted, to England by Robert Adam after his famous continental tour. He worked so extensively for the Adams', and his designs are so closely typical of much upon which their reputation rests, that it is impossible to doubt his influence upon their style. His range, like theirs, was catholic. He designed furniture, mantelpieces, ceilings, chandeliers, doors and mural ornament with equal felicity, and as an artist in plaster work in low relief he was unapproached in his day. He delighted in urns and sphinxes and interlaced gryphons, in amorini with bows and torches, in trophies of musical instruments and martial weapons, and in flowering arabesques which were always graceful if sometimes rather thin. The centre panels of his walls and ceilings were often occupied by classical and pastoral subjects painted by Cipriani, Angelica Kauffman or her husband Antonio Zucchi, and sometimes by himself. These nymphs and amorini, with their disengaged and riant air and classic grace, were not infrequently used as copies for painting upon that satinwood furniture of the last quarter of the 18th century which has never been surpassed for dainty elegance, and for the popularity of which Pergolesi was in large measure responsible; they were even reproduced in marquetry. Some of this painted work was, apparently, executed by his own hand; most of the pieces attributed to him are remarkable examples of artistic taste and technical skill. His satinwood table-tops, china cabinets and side-tables are the last word in a daintiness which here and there perhaps is mere prettiness. Pergolesi likewise designed silver plate, and many of his patterns are almost instinctively attributed to the brothers Adam by the makers and purchasers of modern reproductions. There is, moreover, reason to believe that he aided the Adam firm in purely architectural work. In later life Pergolesi appears, like Angelica Kauffman, to have returned to Italy. Pergolesi wrote Designs for Various Ornaments on Seventy Plates, published between 1777 and 1801.

It is one of the world's largest brands of surfwear and boardsport-related equipment. The parent company changed its name in March 2017 from Quiksilver, Inc. to \\"Boardriders, Inc.\\", and is the owner of the brands Quiksilver, Roxy and DC Shoes.Quiksilver, Inc. renamed Boardriders, Inc. In 2018, Boardriders acquired Billabong International Limited, gaining the Billabong, Element, Von Zipper, RVCA and XCEL brands. Quiksilver manufactures and commercialises a wide range of products that include sportswear (swimsuits), clothing (t-shirts, polo shirts, flannels, jackets, hoodies, pants, shorts), footwear (sneakers, sandals), accessories (hats, backpacks, wallets). -The company also produces a line of apparel for young women, under the Roxy brand. Another line of apparel for women is under the brand Quiksilver Women. In 2013, Quiksilver initiated a turnaround plan after suffering financial losses for six years. However, by September 2015, the company filed for bankruptcy. After emerging from bankruptcy in early 2016, the company once again became privately held, with Oaktree Capital Management as the majority shareholder. Recent corporate history Quiksilver purchased Skis Rossignol for $560 million in 2005, but sold Rossignol on 12 November 2008 for $37.5 million (30 million euros) in cash and a $12.5 million note (10 million euro). Quiksilver owned golf-equipment maker Cleveland Golf up until 31 October 2007, when it sold the company to a Japanese sporting goods company. In 2009, Moody's included Quiksilver on its Bottom Rung list of companies most likely to default on its debt. As of 2013, Quiksilver operated 834 Of these 834 stores, 540 are owned by the company and the rest operate under licensing agreements. stand-alone stores in major cities across Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific, Europe, North and South America, Asia and Africa. At that time, there were two types of Quiksilver-operated stores, known as either \\"Boardriders Club\\" or \\"Factory\\" stores. Their products were also sold in many other outlets across the world, such as PacSun, the Fells Point Surf Company and the Ron Jon Surf Shop. With PacSun's decline in retail prominence, Quiksilver and other brands suffered diminished sales. In addition, the company operated a number of separate Roxy and Quiksilver Youth stores. As of 2013, the company had lost financially for six years and initiated a turnaround plan in an attempt to resolve this. In September 2015, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Co-founder and CEO of Quiksilver Bob McKnight stepped down as CEO on 11 January 2013. He then acted as Executive Chairman, until retiring in October 2014. Andy Mooney, who was formerly chairman of Disney Consumer Products, served as CEO from 2013 to 2015. Mooney stepped down as the CEO of Quiksilver and was replaced in March 2015 by longtime Quiksilver employee Pierre Agnes to restructure the brand. In 2015, Pierre Agnes was promoted from president to CEO. Quiksilver emerged from bankruptcy in early 2016, and the company once again became privately held, with Oaktree Capital Management as the majority shareholder. By the end of 2016, their retail presence had significantly diminished after restructuring by Oaktree. The company's name was changed in March 2017 to Boardriders, Inc., and it is the owner of the Quiksilver, Roxy and DC Shoes brands. Boardriders purchased Billabong International Limited in 2018. On 30 January 2018, the global CEO of Boardriders, Pierre Agnes, was declared missing after his sailboat washed ashore without him near Biarritz, France, after he radioed in to delay his return in thick fog conditions. A search operation by air and sea was launched the same day. The search was called off a few days later, as he was declared lost at sea and presumed dead. Dave Tanner, the company's former chief turnaround officer, became CEO on 6 February 2018. Boardriders, Inc. currently owns the following brands: Quiksilver, Roxy, DC Shoes, Billabong, Element, Von Zipper, RVCA and XCEL. Roxy In 1990, Quiksilver launched its sister brand for young women, Roxy. The brand was shuttered after the 1991 surf industry crash but revived by Bob McKnight and Danny Kwock in 1992, signing Lisa Andersen in 1993. It was differentiated from the main Quiksilver line \\"for fear it would damage the men's brand\\", according to Randy Hild, the company's senior vice president of marketing. Roxy was chosen because it sounded like a punk band or club (likely Roxy Music and The Roxy respectively), and is also the name of the daughters of both CEO Bob McKnight and founder Alan Green. About 30% of Quiksilver's sales come from the Roxy line. Since inception, Roxy has grown to be the largest action sport fashion apparel company for young women. In addition to apparel, it now also produces accessories, homewares, hard goods (snow and surf), wetsuits, footwear, books and perfumes. It has sub-brands for its children's ranges, Roxy Girl and Teenie Wahine. In the spring of 2013, the \\"DVF loves Roxy\\" collection was released as a one-time limited edition collaboration line of swim and beach wear as well as accessories.  Brand image  The Quiksilver brand's logo, designed in 1973 by founders Alan Green and John Law, was inspired by Japanese painter Hokusai's woodcut, The Great Wave off Kanagawa. It depicts a large wave with a mountain on a red background. The Roxy logo consists of two copies of the Quiksilver logo, one reflected, forming a heart.

It is also equal to the sum of average variable costs (total variable costs divided by Q) and average fixed costs (total fixed costs divided by Q)Average costs may be dependent on the time period considered (increasing production may be expensive or impossible number in the short term, for example). Average costs affect the supply curve and are a fundamental component of supply and demand. Short-run average cost A U-shaped short-run Average Cost (AC) curve. AVC is the Average Variable Cost, AFC the Average Fixed Cost, and MC the marginal cost curve crossing the minimum points of both the Average Variable Cost and Average Cost curves. Short-run costs are those that vary with almost no time lagging. Labor cost and the cost of raw materials are short-run costs, but physical capital is not. An average cost curve can be plotted with cost on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis. Marginal costs are often also shown on these graphs, with marginal cost representing the cost of the last unit produced at each point; marginal costs in the short run are the slope of the variable cost curve (and hence the first derivative of variable cost). A typical average cost curve has a U-shape, because fixed costs are all incurred before any production takes place and marginal costs are typically increasing, because of diminishing marginal productivity. In this \\"typical\\" case, for low levels of production marginal costs are below average costs, so average costs are decreasing as quantity increases. An increasing marginal cost curve intersects a U-shaped average cost curve at the latter's minimum, after which the average cost curve begins to slope upward. For further increases in production beyond this minimum, marginal cost is above average costs, so average costs are increasing as quantity increases. For example: for a factory designed to produce a specific quantity of widgets per period‚Äîbelow a certain production level, average cost is higher due to under-used equipment, and above that level, production bottlenecks increase average cost. Long-run average cost Long-run average cost is the unit cost of producing a certain output when all inputs, even physical capital, are variable. The behavioral assumption is that the firm will choose that combination of inputs that produce the desired quantity at the lowest possible cost. A long-run average cost curve is typically downward sloping at relatively low levels of output, and upward or downward sloping at relatively high levels of output. Most commonly, the long-run average cost curve is U-shaped, by definition reflecting economies of scale where negatively sloped and diseconomies of scale where positively sloped. If the firm is a perfect competitor in all input markets, and thus the per-unit prices of all its inputs are unaffected by how much of the inputs the firm purchases, then it can be shownGelles, Gregory M., and Mitchell, Douglas W., \\"Returns to scale and economies of scale: Further observations,\\" Journal of Economic Education 27, Summer 1996, 259-261.Frisch, R., Theory of Production, Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1965.Ferguson, C. E., The Neoclassical Theory of Production and Distribution, London: Cambridge University Press, 1969. that at a particular level of output, the firm has economies of scale (i.e., is operating in a downward sloping region of the long-run average cost curve) if and only if it has increasing returns to scale, the latter being exclusively a feature of the production function. Likewise, it has diseconomies of scale (is operating in an upward sloping region of the long-run average cost curve) if and only if it has decreasing returns to scale, and has neither economies nor diseconomies of scale if it has constant returns to scale. With perfect competition in the output market the long-run market equilibrium will involve all firms operating at the minimum point of their long-run average cost curves (i.e., at the borderline between economies and diseconomies of scale). If, however, the firm is not a perfect competitor in the input markets, then the above conclusions are modified. For example, if there are increasing returns to scale in some range of output levels, but the firm is so big in one or more input markets that increasing its purchases of an input drives up the input's per-unit cost, then the firm could have diseconomies of scale in that range of output levels. Conversely, if the firm is able to get bulk discounts of an input, then it could have economies of scale in some range of output levels even if it has decreasing returns in production in that output range. In some industries, long-run average cost is always declining (economies of scale exist indefinitely). This means that the largest firm tends to have a cost advantage, and the industry tends naturally to become a monopoly, and hence is called a natural monopoly. Natural monopolies tend to exist in industries with high capital costs in relation to variable costs, such as water supply and electricity supply.  Relationship to marginal cost  When average cost is declining as output increases, marginal cost is less than average cost. When average cost is rising, marginal cost is greater than average cost. When average cost is neither rising nor falling (at a minimum or maximum), marginal cost equals average cost. Other special cases for average cost and marginal cost appear frequently: * Constant marginal cost/high fixed costs: each additional unit of production is produced at constant additional expense per unit. The average cost curve slopes down continuously, approaching marginal cost. An example is hydroelectric generation, which has no fuel expense, limited maintenance expenses and a high up-front fixed cost (ignoring irregular maintenance costs or useful lifespan). Industries with fixed marginal costs, such as electrical transmission networks, may meet the conditions for a natural monopoly, because once capacity is built, the marginal cost to the incumbent of serving an additional customer is always lower than the average cost for a potential competitor. The high fixed capital costs are a barrier to entry. * Two popular pricing mechanisms are average cost pricing (or rate of return regulation) and marginal cost pricing. A monopoly produces where its average cost curve meets the market demand curve under average cost pricing, referred to as the average cost pricing equilibrium. * Minimum efficient scale: Marginal or average costs may be nonlinear, or have discontinuities. Average cost curves may therefore only be shown over a limited scale of production for a given technology. For example, a nuclear plant would be extremely inefficient (high average cost) for production in small quantities. Similarly, its maximum output for any given time period may essentially be fixed, and production above that level may be technically impossible, dangerous or extremely costly. The long run elasticity of supply are higher, as new plants could be built and brought on-line. * Zero fixed costs (long-run analysis) and constant marginal cost: since there are no economies of scale, average cost is equal to the constant marginal cost.  Relationship between AC, AFC, AVC and MC  1\\\\. The Average Fixed Cost curve (AFC) starts from a height and goes on declining continuously as production increases. 2\\\\. The Average Variable Cost curve, Average Cost curve and the Marginal Cost curve start from a height, reach the minimum points, then rise sharply and continuously. 3\\\\. The Average Fixed Cost curve approaches zero asymptotically. The Average Variable Cost curve is never parallel to or as high as the Average Cost curve due to the existence of positive Average Fixed Costs at all levels of production; but the Average Variable Cost curve asymptotically approaches the Average Cost curve from below. 4\\\\. The Marginal Cost curve always passes through the minimum points of the Average Variable Cost and Average Cost curves, though the Average Variable Cost curve attains the minimum point prior to that of the Average Cost curve.

Personal life A descendant of one of the first settlers to America, Philippe de la Noye (Delano) (1602‚Äì1681) Jane Delano attended Cook Academy, a Baptist boarding school in her hometown then studied nursing at the Bellevue Hospital School of Nursing in New York City, where she graduated in 1886. Professional life She started work in 1888 at a Jacksonville, Florida, hospital treating victims of a yellow fever epidemic. There, she demonstrated her superior executive and administrative skills and developed innovative nursing procedures for the patients under her care. Leaving Florida, Jane Delano then spent three years nursing typhoid patients at a copper mine in Bisbee, Arizona until accepting an appointment as the Superintendent of Nurses at University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Chief Executives of the American Red Cross Department of Nursing (1918). Delano is in the center. In 1898, during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Jane Delano became a member of the New York Chapter of the American Red Cross and served as the secretary for the enrollment of nurses. In 1902 she returned to Bellevue Hospital in New York City as the director of the Training School for Nurses where she remained until 1909 when she was made Superintendent of the United States Army Nurse Corps. During this time, her invaluable contributions to her profession resulted in her being named president of the American Nurses Association and chair of the National Committee of the Red Cross Nursing Service. A leading pioneer of the modern nursing profession, Delano almost single-handedly created American Red Cross Nursing when she united the work of the American Nurses Association, the Army Nurse Corps, and the American Red Cross. Through her efforts, emergency response teams were organized for disaster relief and over 8,000 registered nurses were trained and ready for duty by the time the United States entered World War I. During the course of the War, more than 20,000 of her nurses played vital roles with the United States military. For her contributions during the war she was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal by the Secretary of the Army. Death Delano reburial, 1920, Arlington National Cemetery Jane Delano died in France while on a Red Cross mission, expiring at Base Hospital No. 8 in Savenay of Loire-Inferieure, and was interred in a cemetery in the Loire Valley.Base Hospital No. 8 was fourteen miles from the Port of St. Nazaire. The mission was to participate in and represent the American Red Cross at the preliminary conference of Red Cross workers and health experts of the world being held at Cannes. Awarded the Distinguished Service Medal posthumously, the year following her death her remains were brought back to the United States by the Army Quartermaster Corps and re-interred in the nurses section at Arlington National Cemetery. At the top of the hill overlooking the nurses section is a bronze memorial to Jane Delano and the 296 nurses who lost their lives during World War I. Military funeral services, prior to burial, were held Saturday, September 18, 1920. A number of representatives of the American Red Cross, Army officers of the Army Medical Corps, and a delegation of uniformed nurses attended the funeral. A detachment of Army troops and a military band from Fort Myers acted as an escort for the body when it was taken to the grave from the vault at Arlington Cemetery. All present stood silent as \\"taps\\" was given over the grave of Miss Delano.Military Funeral For Red Cross Nurse Head. Associated Press. Washington. Sept. 18, 1920. Delano has been honored many times for her dedication to humanity. She was named to the American Nurses Association Hall of Fame and at Schuyler County Hospital in Dix, New York there is a Jane Delano Memorial with a display of personal items including a number of her awards and medals. In 1990, the National Nursing Advisory Committee formed the \\"Jane Delano Society\\" to ensure active nursing involvement at all levels of the Red Cross and to preserve artifacts that document the history of Red Cross nursing.

Candlish. 9 Randolph Crescent, Edinburgh Rev Robert Smith Candlish DD (23 March 1806 ‚Äì 19 October 1873) was a Scottish minister who was a leading figure in the Disruption of 1843. He served for many years in St. George's Free Church in Edinburgh's New Town. Life He was born at 11 West Richmond StreetEdinburgh Post Office Directory 1805/6 in Edinburgh, the son of James Candlish (1760-1806), a lecturer in Medicine who died soon after he was born. He was raised by his mother, Jane Smith (1768-1854).Inscription on grave of Rev Robert Candlish She moved to Glasgow soon after her husband's death and survived by running a boarding house at 49 Virginia Street.Glasgow Post Office Directory 1816 The building was then a new building. It survives but is now a little dilapidated. In 1820 he began studying Divinity at Glasgow University, where he graduated in 1823. During the years 1823‚Äì1826 he went through the prescribed course at the divinity hall, then presided over by Rev Dr Stevenson McGill. On leaving, he accompanied a pupil as private tutor to Eton College, where he stayed two years. In 1829 Candlish entered upon his life's work, having been licensed to preach during the summer vacation of the previous year. After short assistant pastorates at St Andrew's Church, Glasgow, and then the parish church of Bonhill in Dunbartonshire, he became assistant minister to Mr. Martin of St George's, Edinburgh. He attracted the attention of his audience by his intellectual keenness, emotional fervour, spiritual insight and power of dramatic representation of character and life. His theology was that of the Scottish Calvinistic school, and he gathered round him one of the largest congregations in the city. In 1840 he was living at 9 Randolph Crescent in Edinburgh's West End, a huge terraced townhouse.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1840-41 Candlish took an interest in ecclesiastical questions, and he soon became involved in the struggle which was then agitating Church of Scotland. His first Assembly speech, delivered in 1839, placed him among the leaders of the party that afterwards formed the Free Church, and his influence in bringing about the Disruption of 1843 was inferior only to that of Thomas Chalmers. He took his stand on two principles: the right of the people to choose their ministers, and the independence of the church in things spiritual. On his advice Hugh Miller was appointed editor of the Witness and Miller wrote much of the weekly copy. Following the Disruption Candlish was one of the Free Churchmen who spoke in England, explaining the reason why so many had left the Established Church. He was actively engaged at one time or other in nearly all the various schemes of the church, but particularly the education committee, of which he was convener from 1846 to 1863, and in the unsuccessful negotiations for union among the non-established Presbyterian denominations of Scotland, which were carried on during the years 1863-1873. Candlish was the Free Church Moderator at the Assembly of 1867. He was succeeded in 1868 by Rev William Nixon.Ewing, William Annals of the Free Church In 1841 the government nominated Candlish to the newly founded chair of Biblical criticism in the University of Edinburgh. However, owing to the opposition of Lord Aberdeen,Hansard, House of Lords 22 March 1841.Hansard, House of Lords 29 April 1841. the presentation was cancelled. In 1847 Candlish, who had received the degree of D.D. from Princeton, New Jersey, in 1841, was chosen by the Assembly of the Free Church to succeed Chalmers in the chair of divinity in the New College, Edinburgh. After partially fulfilling the duties of the office for one session, he was led to resume the charge of St George's, the clergyman who had been chosen by the congregation as his successor having died before entering on his work. In 1851 he established a Gaelic Church on Cambridge Street.By The Three Great Roads, In 1862 he succeeded William Cunningham as principal of New College with the understanding that he should still retain his position as minister of St George's. Death The grave of Rev Robert Candlish, Old Calton Cemetery, Edinburgh Candlish died at home, 52 Melville StreetEdinburgh Post Office Directory 1873 in Edinburgh in 1873. As the Free Church lost the right to burial in the traditional parish burial grounds, Candlish is buried in the non-denominational Old Calton Burial Ground. He lies in the southern extension, just south-east of the Martyr's Monument. Family He was married to Jessie Brock (1813-1894) around 1838. Several of their children died in childhood.Inscription on grave of Robert Candlish His most notable child was James Smith Candlish, a leading Calvinist theologian. Works Candlish made a number of contributions to theological literature. In 1842 he published the first volume of his Contributions towards the Exposition of the Book of Genesis, a work which was completed in three volumes several years later. In 1854 he delivered, in Exeter Hall, London, a lecture on the Theological Essays of the Rev. F. D. Maurice, which he afterwards published, along with a fuller examination of the doctrine of the essays. In this he defended the forensic aspect of the gospel. A treatise entitled The Atonement; its Reality, Completeness and Extent (1861) was based upon a smaller work which first appeared in 1845. In 1864 he delivered the first series of Cunningham lectures, taking for his subject The Fatherhood of God. Published immediately afterwards, the lectures excited considerable discussion on account of the peculiar views they represented. Further illustrations of these views were given in two works published about the same time as the lectures, one a treatise On the Sonship and Brotherhood of Believers, and the other an exposition of the first epistle of St John.

According to legend the first settlers named the village \\"Mahm√ªe√Æ\\" because it was in on open and flat ground. The word Mahmuei is a derivation of the word Mahmah which according to Dehkhoda Dictionary means a flat plain. Official statistics for Mahmuei in 1996 estimated a population of 695 people (185 houses and 223 families)..Ludwig W. Adamec, Historical Gazetteer of Iran. Vol.2, Meshed and Northeastern Iran. Graz:Academische Druck,1981.p.460 At the 2006 census, its population was 726, in 243 families. The inhabitants are Shiite Muslims speaking a local dialect of Persian. Most of the population is engaged in agriculture. Major products of Mahmuei are saffron (Za\`fer√¢n) and barberry (Zereshk) that are cultivated for exporting. Beet and wheat are cultivated as well. Grapes, black plume, apricots, melons, watermelons, almonds and pistachios are produced for local use. Before 1950, opium was also cultivated. Prior to digging the first deep well about 1980s, dry farming was the only agricultural method. Today, in addition to a string of underground aqueducts (Qan√¢t), there are two networks of piped water and 23 electric and diesel deep wells for field irrigation. Modern facilities include an electricity network since 1986, health-care, telephone (just one line since 1996,tel: +98 056 2533 -3400), drinking water since 1998, unrefined piped water, asphalt roads, a rural cooperative, an Islamic council, elementary school and a boarding middle school. History of Mahmuei There is a shrine in the village cemetery where a pious man known as √Çq√¢ye M√Ær-Abb√¢ss, a descendant of Muhammad (Seyyed), was buried 70 years ago. The natives respect the shrine and dedicate money to it for obtaining their wants. About 1920s, at the time of making grape syrup (sh√Ære-ye angoor) via boiling grape juice, somebody said to him \\"you are not a descendant of The Prophet.\\" M√Ær-Abb√¢ss became annoyed and stepped into the huge fire that was lighted for boiling grape juices. He sat in the midst of the fireplace (Golkhan) to prove miraculously that he was a descendant of Muhammad. He stayed in the fireplace for a while and did not go out till some villagers entreated him to go out. After that event, the villagers believed and respected him and built a monument on his grave..\\"ŸÅÿ±ŸáŸÜ⁄Ø ÿ¨ÿ∫ÿ±ÿßŸÅ€åÿß€å€å ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ÿ¢ÿ®ÿßÿØ€åŸáÿß\\"ÿå ÿ≤€åÿ± ŸÜÿ∏ÿ± ÿ≠ÿ≥€åŸÜÿπŸÑ€å ÿ±ÿ≤ŸÖ ÿ¢ÿ±ÿßÿå ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜ: ÿ≥ÿßÿ≤ŸÖÿßŸÜ ÿ¨ÿ∫ÿ±ÿßŸÅ€åÿß€å€å ⁄©ÿ¥Ÿàÿ±ÿå 1329ÿå ÿ¨ 9ÿå ÿµ 410 Since 1950, many people emigrated from Mahmuei to city areas, especially to Tehran and Mashad.

In each frame, 100 samples are generated from the distribution, shown in red. Centered on each sample, a Gaussian kernel is drawn in gray. Averaging the Gaussians yields the density estimate shown in the dashed black curve. In probability and statistics, density estimation is the construction of an estimate, based on observed data, of an unobservable underlying probability density function. The unobservable density function is thought of as the density according to which a large population is distributed; the data are usually thought of as a random sample from that population. A variety of approaches to density estimation are used, including Parzen windows and a range of data clustering techniques, including vector quantization. The most basic form of density estimation is a rescaled histogram.  Example of density estimation  Estimated density of p (glu  diabetes=1) (red), p (glu  diabetes=0) (blue), and p (glu) (black) Estimated probability of p(diabetes=1  glu) Estimated probability of p (diabetes=1  glu) We will consider records of the incidence of diabetes. The following is quoted verbatim from the data set description: :A population of women who were at least 21 years old, of Pima Indian heritage and living near Phoenix, Arizona, was tested for diabetes mellitus according to World Health Organization criteria. The data were collected by the US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. We used the 532 complete records. In this example, we construct three density estimates for \\"glu\\" (plasma glucose concentration), one conditional on the presence of diabetes, the second conditional on the absence of diabetes, and the third not conditional on diabetes. The conditional density estimates are then used to construct the probability of diabetes conditional on \\"glu\\". The \\"glu\\" data were obtained from the MASS package of the R programming language. Within R, \`?Pima.tr\` and \`?Pima.te\` give a fuller account of the data. The mean of \\"glu\\" in the diabetes cases is 143.1 and the standard deviation is 31.26. The mean of \\"glu\\" in the non-diabetes cases is 110.0 and the standard deviation is 24.29. From this we see that, in this data set, diabetes cases are associated with greater levels of \\"glu\\". This will be made clearer by plots of the estimated density functions. The first figure shows density estimates of p(glu  diabetes=1), p(glu  diabetes=0), and p(glu). The density estimates are kernel density estimates using a Gaussian kernel. That is, a Gaussian density function is placed at each data point, and the sum of the density functions is computed over the range of the data. From the density of \\"glu\\" conditional on diabetes, we can obtain the probability of diabetes conditional on \\"glu\\" via Bayes' rule. For brevity, \\"diabetes\\" is abbreviated \\"db.\\" in this formula. : p(\\\\mbox{diabetes}=1\\\\mbox{glu}) = \\\\frac{p(\\\\mbox{glu}\\\\mbox{db.}=1)\\\\,p(\\\\mbox{db.}=1)}{p(\\\\mbox{glu}\\\\mbox{db.}=1)\\\\,p(\\\\mbox{db.}=1) + p(\\\\mbox{glu}\\\\mbox{db.}=0)\\\\,p(\\\\mbox{db.}=0)} The second figure shows the estimated posterior probability p(diabetes=1  glu). From these data, it appears that an increased level of \\"glu\\" is associated with diabetes. = Script for example = The following R commands will create the figures shown above.

Application and Purpose  A very natural use of density estimates is in the informal investigation of the properties of a given set of data. Density estimates can give valuable indication of such features as skewness and multimodality in the data. In some cases they will yield conclusions that may then be regarded as self-evidently true, while in others all they will do is to point the way to further analysis and/or data collection. Histogram and density function for a Gumbel distribution A calculator for probability distributions and density functions An important aspect of statistics is often the presentation of data back to the client in order to provide explanation and illustration of conclusions that may possibly have been obtained by other means. Density estimates are ideal for this purpose, for the simple reason that they are fairly easily comprehensible to non-mathematicians. More examples illustrating the use of density estimates for exploratory and presentational purposes, including the important case of bivariate data.Geof H., Givens (2013). Computational Statistics. Wiley. p. 330. . Density estimation is also frequently used in anomaly detection or novelty detection: if an observation lies in a very low-density region, it is likely to be an anomaly or a novelty. * In hydrology the histogram and estimated density function of rainfall and river discharge data, analysed with a probability distribution, are used to gain insight in their behaviour and frequency of occurrence.An illustration of histograms and probability density functions An example is shown in the blue figure.

The family lived at 28 Montrose Street. One of his uncles was George Rainy, the noted slave plantation owner and personality involved in the Highland Clearances. Robert initially studied Medicine at Glasgow University to follow his father's career. However his interests turned to the church, which had been the path of his grandfather, Rev George Rainy (1734‚Äì1810) of Sutherland, in northern Scotland. He was caught by the evangelical fervour of the Disruption of 1843, and moved to Edinburgh to train as Free Church minister at the New College.Ewing, William Annals of the Free Church He was ordained by the Free Church at Huntly in Aberdeenshire in 1851 and then in 1854 moved to the Free High Church in Edinburgh (occupying the north-east section of New College). In 1862 he was elected Professor of Church History in the same college. In 1874 he was made Principal of the college in succession to Robert Candlish, and was subsequently known as Principal Rainy.Free Church Monthly Jan 1907 At this time he lived at 8 Rosebery Crescent in Edinburgh's West End.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1875 He had come to the front as a champion of the Liberal Party in the Union controversy within the Free Church, and in combating Dean Stanley's Broad Church views in the interests of Scotch evangelicism. From 1875 he became one of the leading figures of the Free Church. He guided it through the controversies as to Robertson Smith's heresies, as to the use of hymns and instrumental music (a large part of the church preferring unaccompanied singing), and also to the Declaratory Act. In this he was one of the figures who brought to a successful conclusion the union of the Free Church of Scotland and United Presbyterian Churches, and threw the weight of the newly united church on the side of freedom of Biblical criticism. He was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland in 1887 in succession to Rev Alexander Neill Somerville and was succeeded in turn by Rev John Laird in 1888. Following the Union of 1900 he left the Free Church of Scotland to join as leader of the United Free Church of Scotland serving as its first Moderator. Though not a great scholar he was eminent as an ecclesiastical statesman, and his influence was far-reaching.

Edmund Calvert Lynch attended the Boys' Latin School of Maryland in Baltimore and graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1907. Merrill and Lynch Edmund Lynch met Charles E. Merrill when Lynch was a stockbroker on Wall Street. In 1907, Merrill moved into Lynch's room at the YMCA's boarding house while trying to find a place to live in New York City. The two men shared their ideas of starting a brokerage, and became great friends. On October 15, 1914, Charles E. Merrill and Lynch started Merrill Lynch. Lynch was especially known for helping create, finance, and broker many large chain-stores in the United States, including S.S. Kresge Corporation (now Kmart), J. C. Penney, and Safeway Inc. Lynch also purchased the pioneering French movie company Path√© Exchange in 1921, and later rebranded it to Keith-Orpheum (RKO Pictures).  Predicting the 1929 Stock Market Crash  Edmund C. Lynch gained special notoriety when he foresaw the impending Wall Street Crash of 1929, and advised Merrill Lynch's clients to sell many of their stock holdings in 1928. As many Americans were enjoying the soaring stock market in 1928, Lynch was convinced a disaster was near. His famous letter to all of Merrill Lynch's clients warned: > Now is the time to get out of debt. We think you should know that with a few > exceptions all the larger companies financed by us today have no funded > debt. This is not the result of luck but of carefully considered plans on > the part of their managements and ourselves to place these companies in an > impregnable position.

Lynch's concern for the bullish stock market was so strong that he went to the White House in 1928 and warned President Calvin Coolidge of his intuition. During his meeting with the President, Lynch famously even offered to make President Coolidge a partner of his firm, but the President turned down his offer. When later asked of his incredible foresight in 1933, Lynch told the New York Times, \\"The lesson that I had learned--when stocks are too high they come down--stood me in good stead in 1928-29.\\" It is estimated that Lynch's intuition saved his clients over $83 million. Personal life Edmund Lynch married Signa Janney Fornaris in 1923 with whom he had three children: Vernon, Edmund Calvert Jr. (who later joined his father's firm), and Signa Janney.

Raised in Scotland, Neill taught at several schools before attending the University of Edinburgh in 1908‚Äì1912. He took two jobs in journalism before World War I, and taught at Gretna Green Village School in the first year of the war, writing his first book, A Dominie's Log (1915), as a diary of his life there as head teacher. He joined a Dresden school in 1921 and founded Summerhill on returning to England in 1924. Summerhill gained renown in the 1920s‚Äì1930s and then in the 1960s‚Äì1970s, due to progressive and counter- culture interest. Neill wrote 20 books. His top seller was the 1960 Summerhill, read widely in the free school movement in the 1960s onwards. Early life and career Alexander Sutherland Neill was born in Forfar, Scotland, on 17 October 1883 to George and Mary Neill. He was their fourth son; one of the eight surviving children out of 13. He was raised in an austere, Calvinist house with values of fear, guilt, and adult and divine authority, which he later repudiated. As a child, he was obedient, quiet, and uninterested in school. His father was the village dominie (Scottish schoolmaster) of Kingsmuir, near Forfar in eastern Scotland, and his mother had been a teacher before her marriage. The village dominie held a position of prestige, hierarchically beneath that of upper classes, doctors, and clergymen. As typical of Scottish methods at the time, the dominie controlled overcrowded classrooms with his tawse, as corporal punishment. Neill feared his father, though he later claimed his father's imagination as a role model for good teaching. Scholars have interpreted Neill's harsh childhood as the impetus for his later philosophy, though his father was not shown to be harsher to Allie (as Neill was known) than to anyone else. Neill's mother (n√©e Sutherland Sinclair) insisted on high standards for her family, and demanded comportment to set the family apart from the townspeople. Children usually left the local school for Forfar Academy at the age of 14, and with his father a teacher, Neill was especially expected to do so. Instead of wasting time and money, Neill went to work as a junior clerk in an Edinburgh gas meter factory. His parents took pity on his hatred of the job, homesickness, and its low pay, and so Neill became an apprentice draper in Forfar. He found the work stultifying and came home after a foot inflammation. Neill tried to take an examination that would raise his pay grade, but could not bring himself to study. Now 15, his parents decided to make him his father's assistant \\"pupil teacher\\". The children liked Neill, though he received poor marks from a school inspector. He taught a wider range of topics as his self-confidence grew, and he developed an interest in mathematics from the Forfar Academy maths master. After four years, he tried for teacher training college, but came nearly last in his class. He continued as a pupil teacher in Bonnyrigg and Kingskettle, where he found the teachers' instruction militant and loathsome. He stayed in Kingskettle for three years, during which he learned Greek from a local priest, an experience that increased his interest in academicism and sublimated his interest in priesthood into a desire to attend university. After studying with the priest and the Forfar math master, Neill passed his university entrance exam and preliminary teacher's certification. Neill became an assistant teacher at the Newport Public School in the wealthy Newport-on-Tay, where he learned to dance and appreciate music and theatre. He also fell in love, and Margaret became an obsession of his. He adopted progressive techniques at this school, and abandoned the tawse for other forms of establishing discipline. Neill was friendly and relaxed with his pupils, and described his two years there as \\"the happiest of [his] life thus far\\". He finished his university entrance exams and received his full teaching certification. In 1908, at the age of 25, Neill enrolled in the University of Edinburgh. He began as an agriculture student, at his father's behest for a well-salaried career, but switched to English literature by the end of his first year. Neill was excluded from cultural events due to his lack of funds, but participated in sports, showed interest in the military, and wrote for The Student (the university magazine) and the Glasgow Herald. He became the student paper's editor during his last year, which opened Neill to a world of culture. He also felt more confident to pursue women. In his editorials, Neill criticized the tedium of lectures and the emphasis on tests instead of critical thinking. He began to develop his thoughts about the futility of forced education, and the axiom that all learning came from intrinsic interest. Neill graduated in 1912 and began to edit encyclopedias and similar reference books. He took a new job as art editor of the Piccadilly Magazine, but its operations were halted by the 1914 onset of World War I, in which he served as an officer in the army. He returned to Scotland, working as a head teacher at Gretna Green School during the first year of the war. The diary he wrote for this year was published as a book, A Dominie's Log, in November 1915 by Herbert Jenkins, and received good reviews for its humour and narrative style. Neill was invited to join a progressive school in Dresden in 1921. The school moved to a monastery near Vienna in 1923, where the townspeople did not receive it well. He moved to England in 1924 and started Summerhill in Lyme Regis, where the name came from the estate. Summerhill School Summerhill, 1993The school picked up some notoriety and the average enrolment was 40 pupils. In 1927, it moved to Leiston, where it remained. Neill credited Summerhill's environment instead of himself for the school's reformatory successes. Neill used to offer psychoanalytic therapy (\\"private lessons\\", since he was not a licensed therapist) for children who arrived as delinquents from other institutions, but later found love, affirmation and freedom to be better cures. The Summerhill classroom was popularly assumed to reflect Neill's anti-authoritarian beliefs, though their classes were traditional in practice. Neill did not show outward interest in classroom pedagogy, and was mainly interested in student happiness. He did not consider lesson quality important, and thus there were no distinctive Summerhillian classroom methods. Leonard Waks wrote that, like Homer Lane, Neill thought all teaching should follow student interest, and that teaching method did not matter much once student interest was apparent. In a review of an algebra lesson taught by Neill as recounted through Herb Snitzer's Living at Summerhill, Richard Bailey described Neill's teaching technique as \\"simply awful\\" for his lack of student engagement, inarticulate explanations, and insults directed at students. Bailey criticized Neill's absolution of responsibility for his pupils' academic performance, and his view that charismatic instruction was a form of persuasion that weakened child autonomy. Ronald Swartz referred to Neill's method as Socratic, about which Bailey disagreed. Neill was not religious. Despite this, he would flippantly remark that Summerhill was the only Christian school in England when its philosophy was compared with that of Christ. Neill saw the doctrine of \\"original sin\\" as a means of control and sought a world ruled by love and self-examination. Like Freud, he felt that children who were denied understanding of their sexuality in their youth became adults who were similarly fearful of their own sexuality. Philosophy Neill felt that children (and human nature) were innately good, and that children naturally became just and virtuous when allowed to grow without adult imposition of morality. Children did not need to be coaxed or goaded into desirable behaviour, as their natural state was satisfactory and their natural inclinations \\"in no way immoral\\". If left alone, children would become self-regulating, reasonable and ethical adults. Together with Homer Lane, Neill supported personal freedoms for children to live as they please without adult interference, and called this position \\"on the side of the child\\". Neill's practice can be summarised as providing children with space, time, and empowerment for personal exploration and with freedom from adult fear and coercion. The aim of life, to Neill, was \\"to find happiness, which means to find interest.\\" Likewise, the purpose of Neill's education was to be happy and interested in life, and children needed complete freedom to find their interests. Neill considered happiness an innate characteristic that deteriorated if children were denied personal freedom. Such unhappiness led to repressed and psychologically disordered adults. He blamed a \\"sick and unhappy\\" society for widespread unhappiness. Neill claimed that society harboured fears of life, children and emotions that were continually bequeathed to the next generation. He felt that children turned to self-hate and internal hostility when denied an outlet for expression in adult systems of emotional regulation and manipulation. Likewise, children taught to withhold their sexuality would see such feelings negatively, which would fuel disdain for self. Neill thought that calls for obedience quenched the natural needs of children. Moreover, their needs could not be fulfilled by adults or a society that simultaneously prolonged their unhappiness, although perhaps a school like Summerhill could help. As for \\"interest\\", Neill felt it came organically and spontaneously as a prerequisite for learning. Neill considered forced instruction (without pupil interest) a destructive waste of time. Earlier in his career, he wrote that human interest releases emotions that otherwise congests a person. He added that education's role is to facilitate that release, with Summerhill actualizing this concept. Neill never defines \\"true interest\\" and does not account for the social influences on child interest. Bailey felt that this omission discredits Neill's position against external influence. Bailey also cited \\"adaptive preferences\\" literature, where human interests change based on their surroundings and circumstances, as evidence of how intrinsic interest can be externally influenced. Bailey also dubbed Neill's views on intelligence as \\"innatist\\" and fatalist ‚Äì that children had naturally set capabilities and limitations. Neill saw contemporary interventionist practice as doing harm by emphasising conformity and stifling children's natural drive to do as they please. Neill did not identify with the progressive educators of his time. They advocated far gentler authority in child-rearing, which Neill considered more insidious than overt authority and altogether unnecessary. All imposed authority, even if meant well, was unjustified. He felt that adults asserted authority for its feelings of power, and that this motive was a type of repression. In Neill's philosophy, the goal was maintenance of happiness through avoidance of repressive habits from society. Despite Neill's common citation as a leader within progressive education, his ideas were considerably more radical, and he was called an extremist by other radicals. Unlike Friedrich Fr√∂bel, Neill did not view children with romantic innocence. He saw their animalistic traits as qualities to be \\"outgrown with time and freedom\\". Neill also considered his role in providing emotional support. Emotional education trumped intellectual needs, in Neill's eyes, and he was associated with anti-intellectualism. In actuality, he had a personal interest in scholarship and used his autobiography near the end of his life to profess the necessity of both emotion and intellect in education, though he often took jabs at what he saw to be education's overemphasis on book-learning. Neill felt that an emotional education freed the intellect to follow what it pleased, and that children required an emotional education to keep up with their own gradual developmental needs. This education usually entailed copious amounts of play and distance from the adult anxieties of work and ambition. Neill was influenced by Sigmund Freud's theories of psychoanalysis, Homer Lane's interpretation of Freud, and later, by the unorthodox sexual theories of Wilhelm Reich. The reverence for Reich appears in the abundant correspondence between them.Documented in Record of a friendship: The correspondence between Wilhelm Reich and A. S. Neill, 1936‚Äì1957 (Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 1981). Neill accepted Reich's claims about cosmic energy and his utopian ideas on human sexuality. In Reich's view, \\"discharge\\" of sexual energy leads to happiness, whereas lack of such discharge leads to unhappiness and \\"rigidity\\". Although not a trained therapist, Neill gave psychoanalytic private lessons to individual children, designed to unblock impasses in their inner energies. Neill also offered body massage, as suggested by Reich. Neill later found that freedom cured better than this therapy. Richard Bailey placed Neill alongside William Godwin, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Voltaire, and Robert Owen in Thomas Sowell's \\"unconstrained vision\\" tradition, where human potential is naturally unlimited and human development is dependent on environment and not incentives. Bailey also compared Neill's thoughts on coercion to those of Godwin, who felt that regulation through reward and punishment stunted growth. Neill saw moral instruction as a wedge between natural instinct and conformity and thought children were best off without it. Neill trusted the natural inclinations of children and saw no need to externally and purposefully influence their behaviour. Denis Lawton likened Neill's ideas to Rousseauan \\"negative education\\", where children discover for themselves instead of receiving instruction. Neill is commonly associated with Rousseau for their similar thoughts on human nature, although Neill claimed to not have read Rousseau's Emile, or On Education until near the end of his life. John Cleverley and D. C. Phillips declared Neill \\"the most notable figure in the Rousseauean tradition\\", and Frank Flanagan credited Neill with actualising what Rousseau envisaged. Marc-Alexandre Prud-homme and Giuliano Reis found the comparison \\"inappropriate\\" on the basis of Rousseau's views on gender. Peter Hobson found Neill's philosophy of education incomplete, oversimplified, without a \\"coherent theory of knowledge\\", and too dependent on his experience instead of philosophical position. When presented with Hobson's position, four experts on Neill and Summerhill considered his assertions \\"irrelevant\\". Joel Spring likened Neill's views on the family to that of Mary Wollstonecraft, in that the parents would share power equally. =Freedom, not licence= When Neill said children should be free, he did not mean complete freedom, but freedom without licence‚Äîthat everyone can do as they like unless such action encroaches upon another's freedom. As such, adults could and should protect children from danger, but not trample their self-regulation. Neill emphasised that adult removal from child affairs was distinct from disregard for their security. He felt that children met their own limits naturally. Neill believed in equal rights between parents and children, and that undesirable \\"disciplined\\" or \\"spoiled\\" homes were created when those rights were imbalanced. He felt it unnecessary to fulfil all of childhood's requests and had great disdain for spoiled children. Summerhill children were naturally restricted by the school's limited teaching expertise and low funds. Bailey wrote that Neill did not have full faith in self-regulation due to his emphasis on the necessity of making specific environments for children. Robin Barrow argued that Neill's idea of self-regulation was contradictory, when its intent was, more simply, the extent to which children need to abide by external restraints. Bailey added that children cannot know the extent to which dull and unknown subjects can be exciting without guidance. He felt that Neill's belief in children's innate and realistic wisdom did not accommodate human characteristics \\"such as error, prejudice, and ignorance\\", ascribed genius-level intelligence to children, and did not consider social aspects in child decision-making. =Self-governance= Self-governance was a central idea to Summerhill, and is perhaps its \\"most fundamental feature\\". Summerhill held a weekly general meeting that decided the school's rules and settled school disputes, where every member of the community‚Äîstaff and student alike‚Äîhad a single vote. Almost everyone in the school attended the meeting, and children always held the majority. Meetings were managed by an elected Chairperson. At times, the school had over 200 rules. Summerhill sought to produce individualists conscious of their surrounding social order, and Neill chose the self-governance of Homer Lane's Little Commonwealth for the basis of that lesson. The general meeting replaced teacher authority with communal control, which freed teachers from their roles as disciplinarians and instructed children in the role of democratic participation and the role of rules. Additionally, reports of teacher‚Äìstudent disputes were rare. Neill felt that the community's authority never created resentment in those subject to sanctions. Sven Muller contended that the meeting was more useful than discipline for creating civic-minded citizens. An ex-pupil recalled some of the wild ideas Neill would propose at the meeting, and while the students would vote him down, she later recounted how the exercise was also intended as a lesson for the staff on the power of the meeting and communal authority. Neill considered self-governance \\"the most valuable asset in education and life\\" and the general meeting \\"more important than all the textbooks in the world\\". On occasion, Neill exercised unilateral decision-making as the owner of the school, despite his emphasis on the authority figure-less nature of the school. Instances include when he once made a decision after the group's discussion protracted, and when he once asserted himself dictator. Ultimately, the school's freedom was Neill's to structure. Writings Neill wrote 20 books in his lifetime. His style was simple and friendly, unlike didactic literature from the era. His topics included the balance of authority and the thoughts‚Äìfeelings relationship. =Summerhill= The 1960 release of Summerhill catapulted Neill into the public view. Richard Bailey described its result as \\"an American cult\\" of Summerhillian schools and their support organizations. The book sold well and made Neill into a figurehead of new interest in education. Bailey added that the unpretentious book's message was easier to impart than Deweyan thought, and that its release inspired Neill's education critic contemporaries as to the viability of their ideas. Reception and legacy Critics regard Neill's influence and importance with mixed opinion. Supporters counted Neill amongst the world's most influential educationists. UNESCO listed Neill within its 100 most important educationists worldwide. The Times Educational Supplement listed him in its 12 most important British educationists of the millennium. Herb Kohl declared Neill \\"one of the greatest democratic educators of the last century\\" in 2005. Academics and teachers cited Summerhill as the common ancestor for free schools, and Neill was poised to become a public figure during Summerhill's heyday in the 1970s. Its detractors do not classify Summerhill as a school. Max Rafferty called Summerhill \\"a caricature of education\\" and felt threatened by the implications of \\"the spread of Neill's hedonism to the majority of the next generation\\". Others criticized Neill for his progressive ideals despite agreement on his critique of traditional schools, and bemoaned his \\"outdated radicalism\\" and \\"dangerously enthusiastic following in teaching training institutions\\". Richard Bailey wrote that Summerhill received most of its public attention in the 1920s to 1930s and in the 1960s to 1970s, which were milieux of social change (progressivism and the counterculture, respectively). Neill was known in British education circles by the 1920s and was \\"probably Britain's first educational celebrity\\" in the 1930s, though he was not driven by his reception. Journal reviews called Neill \\"the most popular writer on education today\\" and said of his works, \\"Nearly all the more alive and up-to- date teachers in Britain have read and argued about his notions\\". He was known via his books as a figure in the new psychoanalysis. The accessible 1960 Summerhill crowned Neill the leader of a new avant-garde education and he became symbolic of the rebel decade. Neill is generally associated with democratic schools as a leader in its tradition. H. A. T. Child associated Summerhill with the Bedales School, Alfred the Great, and Child's Dartington Hall School, and David Gribble wrote about schools around the world following Neill's teachings in 1998. Timothy Gray linked the release of Summerhill with the rise of writers Herb Kohl, Jonathan Kozol, Neil Postman, and Ivan Illich. Scholars debate whether Neill fits best in a progressive or more radical tradition. Few of Neill's acolytes continued his work after his death. His family maintained Summerhill, with Neill's daughter as its headmaster . Others influenced by Neill included John Aitkenhead, Michael Duane, and R. F. Mackenzie. Richard Bailey wrote that Maria Montessori and Rudolf Steiner's followers were more evangelical in character, and that Neill deterred would-be devotees. He specifically discouraged American association with his school in both name and likeness. By 1972, Ray Hemmings wrote that Neill's ideas were misinterpreted in the hands of other schools. Hemmings found Neill to have moderate influence on state schools in areas such as teacher‚Äìstudent interactions. Neill's views on sexuality and non-compulsory lessons did not have widespread acceptance. Herb Snitzer said that Neill \\"influenced thousand of teachers\\". Both George Dennison and Bailey felt Neill's influence to not be easily measurable, with Dennison adding that non-Summerhill schools continue to adopt Neillian thought. Neill was awarded three honorary degrees: a master's and two honorary doctorates. One doctorate was from the Newcastle University in 1966. He was reportedly very proud of the awards.

Previously William Law had given his allegiance to the House of Stuart and is sometimes considered a second-generation non-juror (an earlier generation of non-jurors included Thomas Ken). Thereafter, Law first continued as a simple priest (curate) and when that too became impossible without the required oath, Law taught privately, as well as wrote extensively. His personal integrity, as well as his mystic and theological writing greatly influenced the evangelical movement of his day as well as Enlightenment thinkers such as the writer Dr Samuel Johnson and the historian Edward Gibbon. In 1784 William Wilberforce (1759‚Äì1833), the politician, philanthropist and leader of the movement to stop the slave trade, was deeply touched by reading William Law's book A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life (1729). Law's spiritual writings remain in print today. Early life Law was born at Kings Cliffe, Northamptonshire, in 1686. In 1705 he entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge as a sizar, where he studied the classics, Hebrew, philosophy and mathematics. In 1711 he was elected fellow of his college and was ordained. He resided at Cambridge, teaching and taking occasional duty until the accession of George I, when his conscience forbade him to take the oaths of allegiance to the new government and of abjuration of the Stuarts. His Jacobitism had already been betrayed in a tripos speech. As a non-juror, he was deprived of his fellowship. For the next few years Law is said to have been a curate in London. By 1727 he lived with Edward Gibbon (1666‚Äì1736) at Putney as tutor to his son Edward, father of the historian, who says that Law became the much- honoured friend and spiritual director of the family. In the same year he accompanied his pupil to Cambridge and lived with him as governor, in term time, for the next four years. His pupil then went abroad but Law was left at Putney, where he remained in Gibbon's house for more than 10 years, acting as a religious guide not only to the family but to a number of earnest-minded people who came to consult him. The most eminent of these were the two brothers, John and Charles Wesley, John Byrom the poet, George Cheyne the Newtonian physician, and Archibald Hutcheson, MP for Hastings. The household dispersed in 1737. Law by 1740 retired to Kings Cliffe, where he had inherited from his father a house and a small property. There he was joined by Elizabeth Hutcheson, the rich widow of his old friend (who recommended on his death-bed that she place herself under Law's spiritual guidance) and Hester Gibbon, sister to his late pupil. For the next 21 years, the trio devoted themselves to worship, study and charity, until Law died on 9 April 1761. Bangorian controversy and after The first of Law's controversial works was Three Letters to the Bishop of Bangor (1717), a contribution to the Bangorian controversy on the high church side. It was followed by Remarks on Mandeville's Fable of the Bees (1723), in which he vindicated morality; it was praised by John Sterling, and republished by F. D. Maurice. Law's Case of Reason (1732), in answer to Tindal's Christianity as old as the Creation is to some extent an anticipation of Joseph Butler's argument in the Analogy of Religion. His Letters to a Lady inclined to enter the Church of Rome are specimens of the attitude of a High Church Anglican towards Roman Catholicism. Writings on practical divinity A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life (1729), together with its predecessor, A Practical Treatise Upon Christian Perfection (1726), deeply influenced the chief actors in the great Evangelical revival.In A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life Law urges that every day should be viewed as a day of humility by learning to serve others. Foster, Richard J., Celebration Of Discipline, San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1988, p.131. John and Charles Wesley, George Whitefield, Henry Venn, Thomas Scott, and Thomas Adam all express their deep obligation to the author. The Serious Call also affected others deeply. Samuel Johnson,\\"I became a sort of lax talker against religion, for I did not think much against it; and this lasted until I went to Oxford, where it would not be suffered. When at Oxford, I took up Law's Serious Call, expecting to find it a dull book (as such books generally are), and perhaps to laugh at it. But I found Law quite an overmatch for me; and this was the first occasion of my thinking in earnest of religion after I became capable of rational inquiry.\\", Samuel Johnson, recounted in James Boswell's, Life of Johnson, ch. 1. Gibbon, Lord Lyttelton and Bishop Home all spoke enthusiastically of its merits; and it is still the work by which its author is popularly known. It has high merits of style, being lucid and pointed to a degree. In a tract entitled The Absolute Unlawfulness of the Stage Entertainment (1726) Law was agitated by the corruptions of the stage to preach against all plays, and incurred some criticism the same year from John Dennis in The Stage Defended. His writing is anthologised by various denominations, including in the Classics of Western Spirituality series by the Catholic Paulist Press. Mysticism B√∂hme's cosmogony or the Philosophical Sphere or the Wonder Eye of Eternity (1620). In his later years, Law became an admirer of the German Christian mystic Jakob B√∂hme. The journal of Law's friend John Byrom mentions that, probably around 1735 or 1736, the physician and Behmenist George Cheyne had drawn Law's attention to the book Fides et Ratio, written in 1708 by the French Protestant theologian Pierre Poiret. It was in this book that Law came across the name of the mystic Jakob B√∂hme. From then on Law's writings such as A Demonstration of the Errors of a late Book (1737) and The Grounds and Reasons of Christian Regeneration (1739), began to contain a mystical note. In 1740 appeared An Earnest and Serious Answer to Dr. Trapp and in 1742 An Appeal to All that Doubt. The Appeal was greatly admired by Law's friend George Cheyne, who wrote on 9 March 1742 to his good friend, the printer and novelist Samuel Richardson: \\"Have you seen Law's Appeal ... it is admirable and unanswerable\\". John Byrom wrote a poem based on An Earnest and Serious Answer, which was found among the manuscripts of Samuel Richardson after his death in 1761. Law's mystical tendencies caused the first breach in 1738 between Law and the practical-minded John Wesley after an exchange of four letters in which each explained his own position. After eighteen years of silence Wesley attacked Law and his Behmenist philosophy once again in an open letter in 1756 in which Wesley wrote: Lime Grove Putney (1846), home of the Gibbon family where William Law walked with John Byrom and other friends. > I have scarce met with a greater friend to darkness except 'the illuminated > Jacob Behmen'. But, Sir, have you not done him an irreparable injury? I do > not mean by misrepresenting his sentiments; (though some of his profound > admirers are positive that you misunderstand and murder him throughout) but > by dragging him out of his awful obscurity; by pouring light upon his > venerable darkness. Men may admire the deepness of the well, and the > excellence of the water it contains: But if some officious person puts a > light into it, it will appear to be both very shallow and very dirty. I > could not have borne to spend so many words on so egregious trifles, but > that they are mischievous trifles: ... bad philosophy has, by insensible > degrees, paved the way for bad divinity.J. Wesley, Works, Vol. IX, pp. > 477-478. Law never responded to this open letter, though he had been deeply upset, as was testified by John Byrom. After seven years of silence Law further explored B√∂hme's ideas in The Spirit of Prayer (1749‚Äì1750), followed by The Way to Divine Knowledge (1752) and The Spirit of Love (1752‚Äì1754). He worked on a new translation of B√∂hme's works for which The Way to Divine Knowledge had been the preparation. Samuel Richardson had been involved in the printing of some of Law's works, e.g. A Practical Treatise upon Christian Perfection (second edition of 1728), and The Way to Divine Knowledge (1752), since Law's publishers William and John Innys worked closely with Samuel Richardson. Title page of the Johann Georg Gichtel (1638‚Äì1710) edition of 1682, printed in Amsterdam. Law had taught himself the \\"High Dutch Language\\" to be able to read the original text of the \\"blessed Jacob\\". He owned a quarto edition of 1715, which had been carefully printed from the Johann Georg Gichtel edition of 1682, printed in Amsterdam where Gichtel (1638‚Äì1710) lived and worked.This edition is the Theosophia Revelata. Das isst: Alle G√∂ttliche Schriften des Gottseligen und hocherleuchteten Deutschen Theosophi Jacob B√∂hmens, 2 Vols., Johann Otto Gl√ºssing, Hamburg, 1715. After the death of both Law and Richardson in 1761, Law's friends George Ward and Thomas Langcake published between 1764 and 1781 a four-volume version of the works of Jakob B√∂hme. It was paid for by Elizabeth Hutcheson. This version became known as the Law- edition of B√∂hme, even though Law had never found the time to contribute to this new edition.This William Law edition is available online, see http://www.jacobboehmeonline.com/william_law. As a result of this it was ultimately based on the original translations made by John Ellistone and John Sparrow between 1645 and 1662, with only a few changes. This edition was greatly admired by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Blake. Law had found some illustrations made by the German early B√∂hme exegetist Dionysius Andreas Freher (1649‚Äì1728) which had been included in this edition. Upon seeing these symbolic drawings Blake said during a dinner party in 1825 \\"Michel Angelo could not have surpassed them\\". =Law's Admiration for Isaac Newton and Jakob B√∂hme= Law greatly admired both Isaac Newton, whom he called \\"this great philosopher\\" and Jakob B√∂hme, \\"the illuminated instrument of God\\". In part I of The Spirit of Love (1752) Law wrote that in the three properties of desire one can see the \\"Ground and Reason\\" of the three great \\"laws of matter and motion lately discovered [by Sir Isaac Newton]\\". Law added that he \\"need[ed] no more to be told that the illustrious Sir Isaac [had] ploughed with Behmen's heifer\\" which had led to the discovery of these laws. Law added that in the mathematical system of Newton these three properties of desire, i.e. \\"attraction, equal resistance, and the orbicular motion of the planets as the effect of them\\", are treated as facts and appearances, whose ground appears not to be known. However, Law wrote, it is in \\"our Behmen, the illuminated Instrument of God\\" that: > Their Birth and Power in Eternity are opened; their eternal Beginning is > shown, and how and why all Worlds, and every Life of every Creature, whether > it be heavenly, earthly, or hellish, must be in them, and from them, and can > have no Nature, either spiritual or material, no kind of Happiness or > Misery, but according to the working Power and State of these Properties. > All outward Nature, all inward Life, is what it is, and works as it works, > from this unceasing powerful Attraction, Resistance, and Whirling.\\"William > Law, Works, 9 volumes, (reprint of the Moreton ed., Brockenhurst, Setley, > 1892-93 which was a reprint of London edition of 1762), Wipf and Stock > Publishers, Eugene, Oregon, U.S.A., 2001, Vol. VIII, pp. 19-20. Aldous Huxley quotes admiringly and at length from Law's writings on mysticism in his anthology The Perennial Philosophy, pointing out remarkable parallels between his ( Law's ) mystical insights and those of Mahayana Buddhism, Vedanta, Sufism, Taoism and other traditions encompassed by Leibniz's concept of the Philosophia Perennis.

It is also known as Picpoule (with various variations of spelling (Piquepoul, Picpoul), although it is in fact unrelated to the Picpoul of the Languedoc) as well as Gros Plant and Enrageat blanc. Folle blanche is an offspring of Gouais blanc, with the other parent so far unidentified.IFV: Le Folle blanche B , accessed 2010-11-24 It has been mostly replaced by its hybrid offspring Baco blanc due to phylloxera damage. Baco blanc (also known as Baco 22 A) is a cross of Folle blanche and the Vitis riparia √ó Vitis labrusca hybrid Noah. Folle blanche is also the parent of the very hardy and disease-resistant Baco 1 (or Baco noir), a cross of Folle blanche and a Vitis riparia variety. Baco noir and Baco 22 A, like Folle blanche and their other parents, produce a very acid wine. This makes them more suited to distillation than less acidic grapes. Folle blanche is used in the Loire Valley area and in Brittany around Nantes to produce Gros Plant du Pays Nantais, a very dry and often tartly acidic wine that pairs well with shellfish.Vall√©e de Loire: Les c√©pages du Val de Loire There it is used both in the production of table wine as well as eau de vie. History Gouais blanc, one of the parent varieties of Folle blanche. The first recorded mentioning of Folle blanche was in 1696 when the grape was documented as one of the varieties growing in the Charente- Maritime department. Here the grape has had a long history being used in the production of Cognac and Armagnac. The name Folle is a feminine derivative of the French word fou which means \\"mad\\" with ampelographers speculating that this could be a reference to the grapevine's tendency to being highly productive and grow vigorously where ever it is planted. Several of Folle blanche's synonyms also seems to make similar allusions such as Gros Plant (\\"big vine\\") which was first used for the grape in 1732 in the Loire- Atlantique department and Enrageat (from the French enrag√©) that has been a common synonym for Folle blanche in Southwest France since at least 1736.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 358-359, 630-633, Allen Lane 2012 DNA analysis in the late 20th and early 21st century has concluded that Folle blanche is likely one of the numerous offspring vines of Gouais blanc, though the second parent is currently unknown. In 2001, French ampelographer Guy Lavignac theorized that Folle blanche likely originated in either the Landes or Gers departments of Southwest France due to the proliferation of offspring and sibling varieties of Folle blanche in those regions. Historically, Folle blanche was planted along the western coast of France from the Loire Valley down through Gascony by Dutch wine merchants who used it in the production of eau de vie. After the phylloxera epidemic of the 19th century, plantings of Folle blanche declined as wine growers switched to heartier, more rot resistant varieties such as the Baco blanc grape in the Cognac and Armagnac regions. This trend continued throughout most of the 20th century and into the 21st century as plantings of Folle blanche steadily declined from in 1958 to in 2009. =Relationship to other grapes= Baco noir, one of the offspring grape varieties of Folle blanche created by Fran√ßois Baco. Through its offspring relationship with the Hunnic grape Gouais blanc, Folle blanche is at least a half-sibling of numerous grape varieties including Aubin vert, Bachet noir, Knipperl√©, Montils, Peurion, Roublot, Dameron, Balzac blanc and Genouillet. American ampelographer Linda Bisson classifies Folle blanche as a member of the Folle ampelographic group with strong similarities and potential genetic relationship with fellow Folle grapes Meslier-Saint-Fran√ßois and Petit Meslier. The rare Bordeaux wine grape Merlot blanc is a natural crossing of Folle blanche and Merlot that was discovered in 1891. Other grapes that have a parent-offspring relationship with Folle blanche include Monbadon, also known as Burger in California, which is believed to be a crossing of Folle blanche and Ugni blanc and Jurancon blanc, which is believed to be a crossing of Folle blanche with Pru√©ras At one point Folle blanche was thought to be a color mutation of Jurancon noir (which is also known as Folle noire) but DNA analysis in 2009 showed that the black berried Jurancon grape was actually an offspring of Folle blanche through a natural crossing with Malbec. Additionally, Fuella nera (another grape known under the synonym Folle noire) was once speculated to have been a color mutation but DNA evidence has shown that is not the case. Folle blanche has been used to breed a number of new varieties including Baco blanc (with Noah) and Baco noir (with an unknown Vitis riparia species) with both made by grape breeder Fran√ßois Baco as well as Folignan which was created in 1965 at the Institut national de la recherche agronomique (INRA) as a crossing with Ugni blanc. =Confusion with other varieties= Due to its complex genetic relationship with numerous varieties, Folle blanche is often mistaken for grape varieties that share some familial relationship such as its half-sibling Knipperl√©. The synonyms Piquepoul used in the Gascony region and Piquepoul du Gers used in the Lot-et-Garonne department lead to confusion with the Rhone wine grape Piquepoul blanc but DNA analysis has shown no close relationship with the two varieties. Viticulture Grape leaf from a Folle blanche vine. While Folle blanche can be a very productive, mid-ripening and high yielding variety, it is highly susceptible to a number of viticultural hazards including downy mildew, mites and black rot. The early budding nature of the vine also makes it susceptible to spring time frost damage while the very compact clusters makes the berries susceptible to fungal infections like botrytis bunch rot. Wine regions A glass of Gros Plant du Pays Nantais made from Folle blanche (Gros Plant). In 2009, there was of Folle blanche growing in France, most of it in the Pay Nantais region (overlapping the Muscadet region) of the Loire Valley where it is used to make the Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e (AOC) wine Gros Plant du Pays Nantais. While the grape's use in Cognac and Armagnac has largely fallen out of favor in preference to Baco blanc, some producers in Armagnac make a varietal brandy out of the grape. Outside France Folle blanche is grown in the Basque Country where it is known as Mune Mahatsa and is sometimes blended with Hondarribi Zuri (Courbu blanc). In the Catalan wine region of Spain it is used by some brandy producers. In California there are a few limited plantings of the variety. Styles According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Folle blanche tends to produce rustic base wines with high levels of acidity. Synonyms Over the years, Folle blanche has been known under a variety of synonyms including:Folle Blanche , Vitis International Variety Catalogue, accessed 2010-11-24 References Category:White wine grape varieties ","title":"Folle blanche"},{"id":"554721","text":"A small hole broken through a window pane. A Hertzian cone also known as Coney Joney is the cone produced when an object passes through a solid, such as a bullet through glass. More technically, it is a cone of force that propagates through a brittle, amorphous or cryptocrystalline solid material from a point of impact. This force eventually removes a full or partial cone in the material.\\"Purdue University - Study on Hertzian cone crack\\" This is the physical principle that explains the form and characteristics of the flakes removed from a core of tool stone during the process of lithic reduction.

Although it might not be agreed by all, natural phenomena which have been grouped with the Hertzian cone phenomena include the crescentic \\"chatter marks\\" made on smoothed bedrock by glacial ice dragging along boulders at its base, the numerous crescentic impact marks sometimes seen on pebbles and cobbles, and the shatter cones found at bolide impact sites.

The War of the Oranges (; ; ) was a brief conflict in 1801 in which Spanish forces, instigated by the government of France, and ultimately supported by the French military, invaded Portugal. It was a precursor to the Peninsular Wars, resulting in the Treaty of Badajoz, the loss of Portuguese territory, in particular Olivenza, as well as ultimately setting the stage for the complete invasion of the Iberian Peninsula by French forces.  Background and development  In 1800, First Consul Bonaparte and his ally, the Spanish prime-minister and Generalissimo Manuel de Godoy, ultimately demanded Portugal, the last British ally on the continent, to break her alliance with Britain. Portugal refused to cede, and, in April 1801, French troops arrived in the country. They were bolstered by Spanish troops under the command of Manuel de Godoy. Godoy had, under his command, the Spanish Army of Extremadura, with five divisions. The Spanish attack to Portugal started on the early morning of the 20 May, and focused on the Portuguese border region that included the main Garrison Town and Fortifications of Elvas and the smaller fortified towns of Campo Maior, Oliven√ßa (Olivenza in Spanish) and Juromenha. The main force of the Spanish Army advanced to Elvas, while two divisions advanced to Campo Maior and another division advanced to Oliven√ßa and Juromenha. Without having their fortifications complete and defended only by a few hundred soldiers, most of the militias, Oliven√ßa and nearby Juromenha quickly surrendered to the Spanish forces. The Portuguese garrison of Campo Maior - under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Dias Azevedo - resisted the assault for 17 days, forcing the Spanish to maintain two entire divisions in its siege. The main Spanish force - under the direct command of Godoy - tried to assault Elvas but was easily repelled by the strong Portuguese garrison commanded by General Francisco de Noronha. The Spanish troops then withdrew to a safe distance from the fortress, with Godoy not daring to attack it again until the end of the war. The war entered in a stalemate, with most of the Spanish forces hold in sieges of fortresses and the rest not being able to face the blockade made by the main core of the Portuguese Army, in order to advance further inside Portugal. Despite this, Godoy picked oranges from the outside of Elvas and sent them to the Queen of SpainH. V. Livermore: Portugal: A Traveller's History, p. 26 with the message that he would proceed to Lisbon. Thus, the conflict became known as the \\"War of the Oranges\\". On 6 June 1801 Portugal agreed to the tenets of the Treaty of Badajoz. Portugal agreed to close its ports to English ships, to give commercial concessions to France, to cede Olivenza to Spain and to pay an indemnity. On 29 September 1801 Portugal agreed to both maintaining the tenets of the Treaty of Badajoz and the alterations made to it, which were all embodied within the Treaty of Madrid. In response, from July 1801 until the signing of the Peace of Amiens in 1802, a British force of 3,500 men under Colonel William Henry Clinton occupied the Portuguese island of Madeira in the North Atlantic Ocean. Intended to forestall any French or Spanish attack on the island, the occupation took place with the tacit consent of the Portuguese. Aftermath After the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, in which the Franco-Spanish fleet lost to Britain, the government of Portugal restored relations with its old ally. This led France to declare the Peace of Badajoz treaty cancelled, again marching on Portugal and invading it, starting the Peninsular War, that lasted from 1807 to 1810. The French invasion forced the transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil in 1807, with Rio de Janeiro becoming the capital of the Portuguese Monarchy. From Rio de Janeiro, the Portuguese monarch denounced the Treaty of Badajoz as having been signed under coercion, declaring it \\"null and ineffective\\". Later on, the Treaty of Vienna - signed by Spain in 1817 - stated clearly that the winning countries are to \\"endeavour with the mightiest conciliatory effort to return Oliven√ßa to Portuguese authority\\". Outcome After the Napoleonic Wars, and the Congress of Vienna, neither Spain nor Portugal gave back the territories acquired both in America (Eastern Missions) and the Peninsula (Oliven√ßa); the latter remaining an issue with the Portuguese government (see Question of Oliven√ßa).

It is often blended with grapes such as Grenache and Carignan to add softness and bouquet.Jancis Robinson, Vines, Grapes & Wines Mitchell Beazley 1986 It has many synonyms, of which perhaps the most confusing is its sale as a table grape called 'Oeillade', although it is different from the \\"true\\" Oeillade which is no longer cultivated. In South Africa, it was known as \\"Hermitage\\", hence the name of its most famous cross Pinotage. History Cinsaut appears to be an ancient variety that may have originated in the H√©rault, but could equally have been brought by traders from the eastern Mediterranean. Distribution and wines =Algeria= Cinsaut is popular in Algeria for its drought resistance, and is used to make large volumes of wine. =Australia= Cinsaut is grown under a variety of names such as Black Prince, Blue Imperial, Oeillade and Ulliade. =France= Cinsaut is the fourth most widely planted grape variety in France, and is especially important in Languedoc-Roussillon. It is also widely used for ros√© wines in Provence. =Italy= Cinsaut vines. Known as Ottavianello, there is one tiny DOC devoted to Cinsaut - Ostuni Ottavianello, with a total production of less than 1000 cases a year.Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari e Forestale, Banca Dati Vini DOC, DOCG :: Ostuni Ottavianello ) However, Cinsaut has long been used in Apulian blends and has also begun to attract the attention of winemakers interested in reviving old varieties.Accademia dei Racemi at diwinetaste.com =Lebanon= Cinsaut is an important component in the blend of Lebanon's Chateau Musar. =Morocco and Tunisia= As in Algeria, Cinsaut is popular in Morocco and Tunisia for its drought resistance. =South Africa= A lot of Cinsaut is grown in South Africa much of which is blended with Cabernet Sauvignon. It holds a special place in the country's viticulture alongside Pinot noir as one of the parents of Pinotage. Of all the grape varieties planted in the Cape, Cinsault has claimed a significant \\"Cinderella\\" turnaround in recent history. Historically, it was favored for its heat tolerance and productivity to be used in bulk blends but winemakers of late have been experimenting with the grape. Many new labels can be found on the market offering crunchy red berry flavors at low alcohols, it is still a very useful blending component with other Rhone varietals, while also adding some fruity brightness to Cabernet Sauvignon. =United States= The oldest continuous Cinsaut vineyard is said to be the Bechtold vineyard in Lodi, California, which was planted in 1885 by Joseph Spenker. Some Cinsaut is planted in California as Black Malvoisie. Cinsaut is planted in the North Coast AVA in California, most specifically in the Red Hills Lake County AVA. Cinsaut is planted in the Yakima Valley AVA in Washington. Cinsaut is planted in Texas, specifically in the Texas High Plains A.V.A. Vine and Viticulture The vine can produce heavy crops, but wines are much better if yields are controlled. Cinsaut is very drought resistant but can be susceptible to disease, so appreciates a dry climate. It produces large cylindrical bunches of black grapes with fairly thick skins.

The territories are: the Northern Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico (which, in Spanish, officially calls itself the 'Free Associated State of Puerto Rico'). The definition of Commonwealth according to current U.S. State Department policy (as codified in the department's Foreign Affairs Manual) reads: \\"The term 'Commonwealth' does not describe or provide for any specific political status or relationship. It has, for example, been applied to both states and territories. When used in connection with areas under U.S. sovereignty that are not states, the term broadly describes an area that is self-governing under a constitution of its adoption and whose right of self-government will not be unilaterally withdrawn by Congress.\\" Current commonwealths =Commonwealth of Puerto Rico= Of the current U.S. insular areas, the term was first used by Puerto Rico in 1952 as its formal name in English (\\"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\\"). The formal name in Spanish for Puerto Rico is Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico (\\"Free Associated State of Puerto Rico\\"). The United States acquired the islands of Puerto Rico in 1898 after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. In 1950, Congress enacted legislation (P.L. 81-600) authorizing Puerto Rico to hold a constitutional convention and in 1952, the people of Puerto Rico ratified a constitution establishing a republican form of government for the island. Puerto Rico's political relationship with the U.S. has been a continuing source of debate in Puerto Rico, the United States Congress, and the United Nations. The issue revolves around whether Puerto Rico should remain a U.S. territory, become a U.S. state, or become an independent country. The debate has spawned several referenda, presidential executive orders and bills in the U.S. Congress. Ultimately the U.S. Congress is the only body empowered to decide the political status of Puerto Rico, as stated under the Territorial Clause. Despite the Spanish translation of the term \\"commonwealth\\", Puerto Rico's relationship with United States is not a Compact of Free Association (which is the case for the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, and the Marshall Islands). As sovereign states, these islands have full right to conduct their own foreign relations, while the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is part of the United States as a territory. The territory was organized by the Foraker Act in 1900, which was amended by the Jones‚ÄìShafroth Act in 1917. The drafting of the Constitution of Puerto Rico by its residents was authorized by Congress in 1951, and the result approved in 1952. The government of Puerto Rico has held several referenda with the options of U.S. statehood, independence, and commonwealth; the commonwealth option won on multiple plebiscites held in 1967, 1993, and 1998.December 2005 report of the President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status In 2012, 54% of the voters did not wish to continue the present territorial status. Of the non-territorial statuses, becoming a U.S. state got 61.16% of the votes, Sovereign Free Associate State got 33.34% and Independence got 5.49%. Puerto Ricans have United States citizenship and vote for a Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, with voice but without vote, in the United States House of Representatives. With the exception of federal employees (such as employees of the United States Postal Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and servicemen in all branches of the military), residents of Puerto Rico generally do not pay federal income taxes (with the exception of Social Security and Medicare taxes) and Puerto Rico has no representation in the Electoral College that ultimately chooses the U.S. president and vice president. Puerto Rico has sports sovereignty, with its own national team at the Olympics and at other international competitions. Puerto Rico also participates in different international organizations such as the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA) (associate member), the Organization of Ibero-American States (full member), and the Ibero-American Summit (associate member). =Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands= In 1976, Congress approved the mutually negotiated Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) in Political Union with the United States. Prior to November 28, 2009, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) did not apply in the CNMI. Rather, a separate immigration system existed in the CNMI. This system was established under the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America (\\"Covenant\\"), which was signed in 1975 and codified as 48 U.S.C. ¬ß 1801. The Covenant was unilaterally amended by the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 (CNRA) approved by the U.S. Congress on May 8, 2008, thus altering the CNMI's immigration system. Specifically, CNRA ¬ß 702(a) amended the Covenant to state that \\"the provisions of the 'immigration laws' (as defined in section 101(a)(17) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(17))) shall apply to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.\\"2 Further, under CNRA ¬ß 702(a), the \\"immigration laws,\\" as well as the amendments to the Covenant, \\"shall ... supersede and replace all laws, provisions, or programs of the Commonwealth relating to the admission of aliens and the removal of aliens from the Commonwealth.\\" Transition to U.S. Immigration Law began November 28, 2009 in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). CNMI's immigration laws have been replaced by the INA and other U.S. immigration laws. =Representation in Congress= U.S. insular areas are not afforded direct representation in the federal legislature, either in the Senate or in the House of Representatives. Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution provides that each U.S. State is entitled to two Senators, but makes no provision for representation of insular areas in the Senate. Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution apportions seats in the House of Representatives among the U.S. States by population, with each State being entitled to at least one Representative, but makes no provision for representation of insular areas in the House. Insular areas are, however, afforded limited representation in the House by a Delegate who may vote in committee but not on the House floor.; Resident Commissioner; election '. Former commonwealth =Commonwealth of the Philippines= The Commonwealth of the Philippines was an insular area that held commonwealth status from November 15, 1935 until July 4, 1946.

He is a former member of the rock band Kiss from 1982 until mid-1984 during the band's transition out of their 1973‚Äì1983 makeup period. Vincent was the last member to wear a unique makeup/costume configuration, as the character of the Ankh Warrior (a design created by Paul Stanley), until he and the band were first shown without the makeup during an interview on MTV in September 1983. He also was the leader of his own band, Vinnie Vincent Invasion. Early life Vincent John Cusano was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the son of Theresa \\"Terri\\" (Ferraro) and Alfonso Cusano, musicians. Both of his parents were of Italian descent. He picked up the guitar at an early age and was inspired by bluegrass and rock and roll. Cusano's first introduction to working with internationally renowned artists was working with Felix Cavaliere (mostly widely known from The Rascals and their hit \\"Good Lovin' ‚Å†\\") as part of the band \\"Treasure\\". This resulted in an album of the same name being released on Epic Records in 1977. It was recorded in New York City at Sound Ideas recording studios In 1980, Vincent moved to Los Angeles, California where he became a staff songwriter for the television series Happy Days and Joanie Loves Chachi. Many of the series songs were written on Vincent's acoustic guitar while sitting at the Cunninghams' kitchen table on the Happy Days set, during off-time from the show's rehearsal schedule. Vincent has said the times of working at the Paramount lot were genuinely \\"happy days\\". According to the site \\"Kiss Related Recordings\\", Vincent has played with Dan Hartman as well as the bands Hunter, Warrior, Hitchhikers and Heat going as far back as 1970. Career =Kiss= \\"The Ankh Warrior\\" After being introduced to the band by songwriter Adam Mitchell, Vincent was brought in as the replacement for guitarist Ace Frehley. Vincent's personality meshed well with Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, thus enabling him to play lead guitar on six of the nine tracks on the Creatures of the Night album as well as co-writing three. After a disappointing Creatures of the Night/Tenth Anniversary tour, that finished on a high at what ended up being the \\"last\\" makeup show (and Kiss' largest crowd attendance) at Maracan√£ Stadium, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil, Vincent returned to the studio with Kiss to record the Lick It Up album. His work was productive, yielding eight co-writes out of the ten songs on the album (a record for any member until Bruce Kulick's nine on Carnival of Souls and Stanley's ten on Monster). Though contributing to Creatures of the Night as a session player before being named as Frehley's replacement in December 1982, Vincent, for all the public knew, was the official guitarist in Kiss and played all the lead guitar tracks on Lick it Up. In what was a frequent occurrence for former guitarist Frehley, a \\"ghost player\\" was asked to play on the album, with Rick Derringer recording the solo on the opening track. right Though the band seemed to have renewed vigor on stage, all was not well. Vincent's refusal to sign the employment contract strained the relationship with Simmons/Stanley. Due partly to disputes over what his role in the band was and his pay would be (some reports indicated that Vincent had asked for, and was flatly denied, a percentage of the band's gross profits), and despite the exhortations of both Simmons and Stanley, all through his tenure with the band Vincent refused to sign any contract, making his employment unofficial. This ultimately led to Vincent leaving the band after the North American leg of the \\"Lick It Up\\" tour.Black Diamond: The Unauthorized Biography of KISS  Dale Sherman  1997 After the Lick It Up Tour ended in March 1984, Vincent was terminated from the band, and replaced by Mark St. John. Despite parting on bad terms, Vincent was later utilized by Kiss as a songwriter on the 1992 album Revenge, contributing to the songs \\"Unholy\\", \\"Heart Of Chrome\\" and \\"I Just Wanna\\". Vincent again fell out of favor with Simmons and Stanley, as they claimed that Vincent again began \\"making all kinds of crazy demands and pulling the same kind of crazy stuff all over again\\". =Vinnie Vincent Invasion= Following his departure from Kiss in mid-1984, Vincent used his money that he made from his tenure in the band to take a long vacation and traveled the world for a full year visiting places like Tahiti, Philippines, Mozambique, India and Europe, including a visit to the small town Mora in Dalarna, Sweden. Then he formed the band Vinnie Vincent Invasion with, among others, former Journey singer Robert Fleischman in the mid-1980s and released two studio albums: Vinnie Vincent Invasion in 1986 and All Systems Go in 1988. The band broke up in 1989. After that, the band's singer Mark Slaughter and bassist Dana Strum formed Slaughter. =Later career= In 1996, Vincent released a solo EP from the studio sessions he did in 1990 (some say 1989‚Äì91), called Euphoria, once again with Robert Fleischman on vocals. Vincent, as well as playing all the guitars, played bass and did the drum programming under the guise of \\"V. Meister\\". Andre LaBelle provided drum tracks to the CD but they were replaced by Vincent's drum programming. LaBelle can be heard on various tracks on the bootleg Guitarmaggedon/Guitars from Hell CD that featured five more songs than the Euphoria EP. A tribute album entitled Kiss My Ankh: A Tribute To Vinnie Vincent was released by SplitScreen Entertainment on August 27, 2008. The album consists of new recordings of songs from Vincent's careers with Kiss and the Vinnie Vincent Invasion. Featured artists include Steve Brown of Trixter, Troy Patrick Farrell of White Lion, T.J. Racer of Nitro, Mike Weeks of Robert Fleischman's band, Sheldon Tarsha of Adler's Appetite, Chris Caffery of Savatage and Trans-Siberian Orchestra, Ryan Roxie from the Alice Cooper band and rock and roll comic C.C. Banana, who performs a parody of the Kiss song \\"Unholy\\" (rewritten as a roast of Danger Danger vocalist Ted Poley). =Appearances in 2018‚Äì2019= After 22 years of being off the radar, Vinnie Vincent agreed to appear at the 2018 Atlanta Kiss Expo in January. Vincent fulfilled his commitment and appeared at the sold-out expo. He said he considers Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley family, wishing them nothing but the best. After some e-mail exchanges with Gene Simmons, Vincent agreed to appear with Simmons on stage in April 2018 which was the first time they have met in person in over two decades. He also gave an exclusive interview to Eddie Trunk for Sirius XM, which was his first in over two decades, and held multiple question-and-answer sessions with fans. On February 16, 2018, it was announced via Facebook that Vinnie would appear at the Days of the Dead convention in Charlotte, North Carolina in May 2018. Vinnie Vincent's first concert in 30 years was scheduled for December 7, 2018 at Graceland, in Memphis, Tennessee. However these shows were postponed until February 8‚Äì9, 2019 in Nashville, before being cancelled. Vincent then announced another show in Nashville called \\"Speedball Jamm\\", which was scheduled for June 7, 2019. This show was ultimately cancelled. Two months later, Vincent hosted Vinnie Vincent's Birthday Bash on August 10th in Nashville, TN, followed by Vinnie Vincent's Merry Metal Christmas on December 14‚Äì15, 2019. Personal life Vincent was married to AnnMarie Peters, and has twin daughters with her. AnnMarie was murdered in 1998, after she and Vincent had divorced.

He wrote the lyrics for the anthem of the Dominion and later Province of Newfoundland, \\"Ode to Newfoundland\\". Early life and education Known as Cavendish Boyle, he was born in Barbados into an ancient British family, the son of Capt. Cavendish Spencer Boyle and Rose Susan Alexander, daughter of Lt-Col. C. C. Alexander. He was the grandson of Sir Courtenay Boyle and the great-grandson of the Seventh Earl of Cork and Earl of Orrery. His elder brother, Sir Courtenay Edmund Boyle, was also a civil servant who served as Permanent Secretary to the Board of Trade. Boyle was educated in London at Charterhouse, and later studied colonial administration and law. Career Sheet music produced for the debut of \\"Ode to Newfoundland\\" in 1902. Boyle joined the British Colonial Office and was made magistrate in the Leeward Islands in 1879. He served as Colonial Secretary in Bermuda from 1882 to 1888 and in Gibraltar from 1888 to 1894. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint John (CMG) in 1889, and granted a knighthood in the same order in the 1897 Diamond Jubilee Honours. In 1894 he moved to British Guiana, where he was Government Secretary and acted as Governor several times. In March 1901, he was appointed Governor of Newfoundland, where he arrived in St. Johns in mid- June. He stayed as such until 1904, and wrote poems to the island's rugged beauty including the Ode to Newfoundland which was adopted as the dominion's national anthem. As governor, Boyle donated a trophy, the Boyle Challenge Cup, to the Newfoundland Hockey League. He continued his colonial career with a posting as the 19th Governor of Mauritius from 20 August 1904 to 10 April 1911, after which he retired to Brighton, England. Personal life In 1914, Boyle married to Judith Louise Sassoon , daughter of Reuben David Sassoon (1835-1905). They had no children. He died in London in 1916 after undergoing an operation. His widow, who was 25 years his junior, lived to be 90, dying in 1960.

Mezz Mezzrow Biography]. He is well known for organizing and financing historic recording sessions with Tommy Ladnier and Sidney Bechet. He also recorded a number of times with Bechet and briefly acted as manager for Louis Armstrong. Mezzrow is equally well remembered as a colorful character, as portrayed in his autobiography, Really the Blues (which takes its title from a Bechet composition), co-written with Bernard Wolfe and published in 1946. Music career Along with his other white counterparts, such as Eddie Condon and Frank Teschemacher, Mezzrow would visit the Sunset Caf√© to learn from and listen to Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five. He admired Armstrong so much that after the release of \\"Heebie Jeebies\\", he, along with Teschemacher, drove 53 miles to Indiana in order to play it for Bix Beiderbecke. Mezzrow organized and took part in recording sessions involving black musicians in the 1930s and 1940s, including Benny Carter, Teddy Wilson, Frankie Newton, Tommy Ladnier and Sidney Bechet. Mezzrow's 1938 sessions for the French jazz critic Hugues Panassie involved Bechet and Ladnier and helped spark the \\"New Orleans revival\\". In the mid-1940s Mezzrow started his own record label, King Jazz Records, featuring himself with groups, usually including Sidney Bechet and often including the trumpeter Oran \\"Hot Lips\\" Page. He also played on six recordings by Fats Waller. He appeared at the 1948 Nice Jazz Festival, following which he made his home in France and organized many bands that included French musicians like Claude Luter and visiting Americans, such as Buck Clayton, Peanuts Holland, Jimmy Archey, Kansas Fields and Lionel Hampton. With ex-Basie trumpeter Buck Clayton, he made a recording of the Louis Armstrong's \\"West End Blues\\" in Paris in 1953. Personal life P√®re-Lachaise Cemetery. Mezzrow became better known for his cannabis proliferation than his music. In his time, he was so well known in the jazz community for selling marijuana that Mezz became slang for marijuana, a reference used in the Stuff Smith song, \\"If You're a Viper\\". He was also known as the Muggles King, the word muggles being slang for marijuana at that time; the title of the 1928 Louis Armstrong recording \\"Muggles\\" refers to this. Armstrong was one of his biggest customers.Rogovoy, Seth (2015). \\"The Original Rachel Dolezal Was a Jew Named Mezz Mezzrow\\". Forward, June 26. p. 16. A letter from 1932, written by Armstrong, demonstrates this relationship; while in England, Armstrong details in this letter about where and how Mezzrow should send marijuana. Record producer Al Rose was critical of Mezzrow's musicianship, saying that in his opinion \\"he wasn't a very good clarinetist,\\" but praised him for his willingness to help other musicians in need, citing \\"his generosity and his total devotion to the music we call jazz.\\" Mezzrow praised and admired the African-American style. In his autobiography, Really the Blues, he wrote that from the moment he heard jazz he \\"was going to be a Negro musician, hipping [teaching] the world about the blues the way only Negroes can.\\" Mezzrow married a black woman, Mae (also known as Johnnie Mae), moved to Harlem, New York, and declared himself a \\"voluntary Negro\\". He believed that \\"he had definitely 'crossed the line' that divided white and black identities\\".Wald, Gail. Crossing the Line: Racial Passing in Twentieth- Century Literature and Culture. Quoted by Rogovoy, p. 16. In 1940 he was arrested in possession of sixty joints while trying to enter a jazz club at the 1939 New York World's Fair, with intent to distribute. When he was sent to jail, he insisted to the guards that he was black and was transferred to the segregated prison's black section. In Really the Blues, he wrote: Mezzrow was lifelong friends with the French jazz critic Hugues Panassi√© and spent the last 20 years of his life in Paris. Eddie Condon said of him (We Called It Music, London; Peter Davis 1948), \\"When he fell through the Mason-Dixie line he just kept going\\".

Background The British had supported the \\"fugitive\\" Peshwa Raghunathrao in the First Anglo- Maratha War, continued with his \\"fugitive\\" son, Baji Rao II. Though not as martial in his courage as his father, the son was \\"a past master in deceit and intrigue\\". Coupled with his \\"cruel streak\\", Baji Rao II soon provoked the enmity of Yashwant Rao Holkar when he had one of Holkar's relatives killed. The Maratha Empire at that time consisted of a confederacy of five major chiefs: the Peshwa (Prime Minister) at the capital city of Poona, the Gaekwad chief of Baroda, the Scindia chief of Gwalior, the Holkar chief of Indore, and the Bhonsale chief of Nagpur. The Maratha chiefs were engaged in internal quarrels among themselves. Lord Mornington, the Governor-General of British India had repeatedly offered a subsidiary treaty to the Peshwa and Scindia, but Nana Fadnavis refused strongly. In October 1802, the combined armies of Peshwa Baji Rao II and Scindia were defeated by Yashwantrao Holkar, ruler of Indore, at the Battle of Poona. Baji Rao fled to British protection, and in December the same year concluded the Treaty of Bassein with the British East India Company, ceding territory for the maintenance of a subsidiary force and agreeing to treaty with no other power. The treaty would become the \\"death knell of the Maratha Empire\\". War Battle of Assaye 1st Battalion 8th Regiment of Native Infantry charge at the cannon, led by Captain Hugh Macintosh This act on the part of the Peshwa, their nominal overlord, horrified and disgusted the Maratha chieftains; in particular, the Scindia rulers of Gwalior and the Bhonsale rulers of Nagpur and Berar contested the agreement. The British strategy included Wellesley securing the Deccan Plateau, Lake taking Doab and then Delhi, Powell entering Bundelkhand, Murray taking Badoch, and Harcourt neutralizing Bihar. The British had available over 53,000 men to help accomplish their goals. In September 1803, Scindia forces lost to Lord Gerard Lake at Delhi and to Arthur Wellesley at Assaye. On 18 October, British forces took the pettah of Asirgarh Fort with a loss of two killed and five wounded. The fort's garrison subsequently surrendered on the 21st after the attackers had erected a battery. British artillery pounded ancient ruins used by Scindia forces as forward operating bases, eroding their control. In November, Lake defeated another Scindia force at Laswari, followed by Wellesley's victory over Bhonsale forces at Argaon (now Adgaon) on 29 November 1803. The Holkar rulers of Indore belatedly joined the fray and compelled the British to make peace. Conclusion On 17 December 1803, Raghoji II Bhonsale of Nagpur signed the Treaty of Deogaon. in Odisha with the British after the Battle of Argaon and gave up the province of Cuttack (which included Mughal and the coastal part of Odisha, Garjat/the princely states of Odisha, Balasore Port, parts of Midnapore district of West Bengal). On 30 December 1803, the Daulat Scindia signed the Treaty of Surji-Anjangaon with the British after the Battle of Assaye and Battle of Laswari and ceded to the British Rohtak, Gurgaon, Ganges-Jumna Doab, the Delhi-Agra region, parts of Bundelkhand, Broach, some districts of Gujarat and the fort of Ahmmadnagar. The British started hostilities against Yashwantrao Holkar on 6 April 1804. The Treaty of Rajghat, signed on 24 December 1805, forced Holkar to give up Tonk, Rampura, and Bundi.

His work can be heard on the band's 1984 album Animalize. St. John died suddenly under murky circumstances in early April 2007, several months after being badly beaten during a brief stay in an Orange County jail. Career =Prior to Kiss= Before joining Kiss, St. John was a well-known and respected teacher, and a guitarist for the Southern California cover band Front Page. After leaving Kiss, he formed a band called White Tiger, featuring David Donato (lead vocals), his brother Michael Norton (bass/backing vocals), and Brian James Fox (drums). Demos that the band had recorded with producer Andy Johns and guitarist Neil Citron, prior to St. John joining, apparently led to Donato's equally short tenure with the band Black Sabbath. =Kiss= St. John was with Kiss only a short time but was featured on the album Animalize, the second album of the non- makeup period. This turned out to be one of Kiss' most successful studio albums, aside from those made by the original lineup. St. John's only video appearance with Kiss is in the video for the hit single \\"Heaven's on Fire\\". During the sessions for the album, which was recorded in mid-1984, St. John clashed with the other members of the band. According to Paul Stanley, they had difficulty putting together solos, with Stanley saying that St. John had trouble playing the same thing twice. Stanley also said that he had to dub in certain parts during St. John's solos to make them work better with the song. St. John developed reactive arthritis, which caused his hands and arms to swell. He was all but unable to perform live as a member of Kiss, and played only two full shows and one partial show during the Animalize tour, with Bruce Kulick playing the rest.Gooch and Suhs, Kiss Alive Forever, pp. 145‚Äì146. St. John was officially replaced by Kulick on December 8, 1984.Gooch and Suhs, \\"Kiss Alive Forever\\", p. 146. He is the only member of Kiss not to appear on any album front cover, as the Animalize cover features only a tapestry of animal prints. However, he is posing with the rest of the band on the album's back cover. =After Kiss= In January 1985 St. John teamed up with vocalist David Donato and drummer Barry Brandt of Angel to work on developing some demo ideas. By March he was playing live again, appearing at an all-star jam session at the FM Station Club. The lineup included Rudy Sarzo and Tommy Aldridge (Kiss Revolution, April/May 1985). St. John also performed at a sold- out audience at a benefit jazz concert for Greenpeace. Some of the legendary jazz musicians playing alongside St. John included the Steve Hooks Band, Stu Nevitt (Shadowfax), Slyde Hyde (Tom Scott/Supertramp), Al Aarons (Count Basie), plus other special all-star guests. St. John and Donato soon formed White Tiger. They had written most of the material for the album by mid-1985 and set out to complete a lineup with which to record. The band also included St. John's younger brother, Michael, on bass, but was completed with the addition of Brian James Fox on drums. While the independent release did well on that level selling some 50,000 copies, and the band gigged around California, White Tiger joined up with Garry Lane owner of Logic Productions who promoted many top bands in LA. St. John and Lane became good friends meeting for a second time at Trojan Studios in Garden Grove, California. That is where St. John and Lane came up with the idea to play the legendary club known as The Hot Spot located in Huntington Beach, California owned by Gennie Gromet who was the ex-wife of Dick Dale from the band Dick Dale and the Del- Tones. The band didn't manage to break and split while working on demos for a second album in 1988. St. John teamed up with Jeff Scott Soto in 1988 to make a demo. St. John also did some session work performing lead guitar on \\"Livin' for My Lord\\" on Ken Tamplin's 1990 album, Axe to Grind. Tamplin is an inspirational Christian rocker more famed for his involvement in the band Shout. Tamplin has also co-written material with Gene Simmons of Kiss. St. John also worked with former Knight Rider star David Hasselhoff, even appearing in his video, \\"Is Everyone Happy\\". St. John made a demo in 1990 with fellow former Kiss member Peter Criss. This band, known as the Keep, became what was essentially White Tiger, with Criss replacing Brian Fox on drums, and David Donato replacing original vocalist David MacDonald. This lineup performed live just once, on May 2, 1990 at a drum clinic at the Guitar Center music store in Lawndale, California. When the band started shopping their demo (credited as Peter Criss) around the response was universally negative. One cassette demo to circulate simply featured \\"Love for Sale\\", \\"Long Time\\", and \\"All Night Long\\", though they had also covered Lee Michaels' 1971 hit \\"Do You Know What I Mean\\", and had other original material such as \\"Between the Lines\\". By early 1991, the difficulty shopping the demo, and St. John's need to get on with making a living, led to friction between Criss and him, and he left the band (which eventually became Criss). He was in a short-lived band with Phil Naro called the Mark St. John Project that released a limited edition EP in 1999, and he also made an appearance at a Kiss expo in New Jersey. He later released an all-instrumental CD in 2003 called Magic Bullet Theory. In later years, St. John did not make many public appearances. Declining health and death Beginning on September 14, 2006, St. John was incarcerated for several days at Theo Lacy Jail in Orange County, California, after being charged with possession of unspecified drug paraphernalia, attempted destruction of evidence, and resisting arrest. He was initially housed at the facility's D Barracks, a medium-security dormitory for nonviolent offenders. He was later moved to F-West Barracks after telling guards he had stolen crackers from another inmate's property box and was in fear for his safety. A guard allegedly conspired with a group of inmates to have St. John assaulted for the transgression, and subsequently St. John was brutally beaten and stabbed with pencils by a group of up to 20 inmates. The guard was later placed on paid leave pending an investigation into this and other violent incidents inside the jail. In an interview with the OC Weekly, a fellow inmate described St. John's encounter: > He got caught stealing something. I guess he did that somewhere else in the > jail, but we found out about it somehow. . . . The Kiss guy got beat up > pretty bad. His girlfriend, who said he was unrecognizable after the vicious beating, believed the incident was directly responsible for his untimely death several months later. A couple of days before the beating, St. John told her that he had \\"snitched\\" on a drug dealer several years earlier, and he believed he was certain to be attacked if this became known by the other inmates. For the next several months after leaving Theo Lacy Jail, St. John suffered severe headaches and body aches and many times told his girlfriend that the chronic ailments were absolutely the result of the beating at Theo Lacy. While it's not known what medical attention he received inside the jail, after his release he refused to see a doctor due to having no medical insurance, and thus his health deteriorated. St. John died on April 5, 2007, due to what the coroner described as a brain hemorrhage brought on by an accidental overdose of methamphetamine. Friends claimed that St. John was never the same after the beating and would not discuss his brief time at Theo Lacy Jail. Another friend stated that St. John fell deep into depression and drug addiction after being released, selling all his outfits, and mowing lawns and doing roofing to afford a drug habit that spiraled out of control.

Peter Blake was a son of Sir Richard Blake and wife Gyles Kirwan.Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd, editor, Burke's Irish Family Records (London, U.K.: Burkes Peerage Ltd, 1976), Blake, page 120. Blake started out as a clerk in the Bank of Ireland but lasted only 18 months before resigning and commencing a cadetship in the Irish Constabulary in 1857. He became a special inspector two years later. In 1876, he was appointed Resident Magistrate to Tuam, an especially disturbed district in the west of Ireland, where he was noted as judicious and active. In 1882, he was promoted to Special Resident Magistrate. Early colonial services In 1884, Blake was made Governor of Bahamas, a position he held until 1887. He was appointed to Queensland in 1886 but resigned without entering the administration, following an imbroglio between Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Knutsford, and the premier of Queensland, Sir Thomas M'Ilwraith, on the appointment. In 1887, he moved to Newfoundland, where he was governor until the end of 1888, being knighted on 7 November that year. In 1889 he became the Captain-General and Governor of Jamaica. His term was extended in 1894 and 1896, at the request of Legislature and public bodies of the island, until 1897. Governor of Hong Kong On 25 November 1898, Blake was appointed Governor of Hong Kong, a position he held until November 1903. Five months before he arrived in Hong Kong, the British Government negotiated an agreement with the Imperial Chinese Government allowing the Hong Kong Government to lease the New Territories for 99 years. During Blake's tenure, he sent in administrators to the New Territories (Tai Po Village) to assert control. The residents of the area organised a tough resistance movement, which was subdued with the use of British troops under Commander Gascoigne, killing about 500 Hong Kong-Tai Po villagers. Blake left Hong Kong immediately after he attended the laying of the foundation stone of the Supreme Court building (Legislative Council of Hong Kong from 1985 to 2011) on 12 November 1903. Post-Hong Kong Blake was appointed Governor of Ceylon at the end of his tenure in Hong Kong in 1903, and he served in that capacity until 1907. This was his last post in the Colonial Service. A freshly retired Blake impressed George Morrison with his bitterness at not landing a Privy Council sinecure in gratitude for his 41 years' public service. The Blakes retired to Myrtle Grove in Youghal, County Cork, where they both died and were buried.Independent article by Patrick Cockburn Personal life Blake married twice: Jeannie Irwin in 1862 (she died in 1866), and Edith Bernal Osborne in Ireland, on 7 February 1874 (she was the daughter of MP Ralph Bernal Osborne). He had two sons, and one daughter Olive, who married John Bernard Arbuthnot. During his period as Governor of The Bahamas, a watercolour of his three children, Children Under a Palm, was painted by Winslow Homer. The painting was subsequently featured on the BBC TV programme, Fake or Fortune?

The war left the Company in control of most of India. It began with an invasion of the Maratha territory by British East India Company troops, and although the British were outnumbered, the Maratha army was decimated. The troops were led by the Governor General Hastings (no relation to Warren Hastings, the first governor-general of Bengal) supported by a force under General Thomas Hislop. Operations began against the Pindaris, a band of Muslim mercenaries and Marathas from central India. Peshwa Baji Rao II's forces, supported by those of Mudhoji II Bhonsle of Nagpur and Malharrao Holkar III of Indore, rose against the East India Company. Pressure and diplomacy convinced the fourth major Maratha leader, Daulatrao Shinde of Gwalior, to remain neutral even though he lost control of Rajasthan. British victories were swift, resulting in the breakup of the Maratha Empire and the loss of Maratha independence. The Peshwa was defeated in the battles of Khadki and Koregaon. Several minor battles were fought by the Peshwa's forces to prevent his capture. The Peshwa was eventually captured and placed on a small estate at Bithur, near Kanpur. Most of his territory was annexed and became part of the Bombay Presidency. The Maharaja of Satara was restored as the ruler of his territory as a princely state. In 1848 this territory was also annexed by the Bombay Presidency under the doctrine of lapse policy of Lord Dalhousie. Bhonsle was defeated in the battle of Sitabuldi and Holkar in the battle of Mahidpur. The northern portion of Bhonsle's dominions in and around Nagpur, together with the Peshwa's territories in Bundelkhand, were annexed by British India as the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories. The defeat of the Bhonsle and Holkar also resulted in the acquisition of the Maratha kingdoms of Nagpur and Indore by the British. Along with Gwalior from Shinde and Jhansi from the Peshwa, all of these territories became princely states acknowledging British control. The British proficiency in Indian war-making was demonstrated through their rapid victories in Khadki, Sitabuldi, Mahidpur, Koregaon, and Satara. The Marathas and the British Map of India after the Second Anglo-Maratha War, 1805 The Maratha Empire was founded in 1674 by Shivaji of the Bhosle dynasty. Common elements among the citizens of Chatrapati Shivaji's Maratha Empire were the Marathi language, the Hindu religion, a strong sense of belonging, and a national feeling. Shivaji led resistance efforts to free the Hindus from the Mughals and Muslim Sultanate of Bijapur and established rule of the Hindus. This kingdom was known as the Hindavi Swarajya (\\"Hindu self- rule\\") in the Marathi language. Shivaji's capital was located at Raigad. Chatrapati Shivaji successfully defended his empire from attacks by the Mughal Empire and his Maratha Empire went on to defeat and overtake it as the premier power in India within few decades. A key component of the Maratha administration was the council of eight ministers, called the Ashta Pradhan (council of eight). The senior-most member of the Ashta Pradhan was called the Peshwa or the Mukhya Pradhan (prime minister). =Growing British power= While the Marathas were fighting the Mughals in the early 18th century, the British held small trading posts in Mumbai, Madras and Calcutta. The British fortified the naval post of Mumbai after they saw the Marathas defeat the Portuguese at neighbouring Vasai in May 1739. In an effort to keep the Marathas out of Mumbai, the British sent envoys to negotiate a treaty. The envoys were successful, and a treaty was signed on 12 July 1739 that gave the British East India Company rights to free trade in Maratha territory. In the south, the Nizam of Hyderabad had enlisted the support of the French for his war against the Marathas. In reaction to this, the Peshwa requested support from the British, but was refused. Unable to see the rising power of the British, the Peshwa set a precedent by seeking their help to solve internal Maratha conflicts. Despite the lack of support, the Marathas managed to defeat the Nizam over a period of five years. During the period 1750‚Äì1761, British defeated the French East India Company in India, and by 1793 they were firmly established in Bengal in the east and Madras in the south. They were unable to expand to the west as the Marathas were dominant there, but they entered Surat on the west coast via the sea. The Marathas marched beyond the Indus as their empire grew. The responsibility for managing the sprawling Maratha empire in the north was entrusted to two Maratha leaders, Shinde and Holkar, as the Peshwa was busy in the south. The two leaders did not act in concert, and their policies were influenced by personal interests and financial demands. They alienated other Hindu rulers such as the Rajputs, the Jats, and the Rohillas, and they failed to diplomatically win over other Muslim leaders. A large blow to the Marathas came in their defeat on 14 January 1761 at Panipat against a combined Muslim force that gathered defeating Marathas led by the Afghan Ahmad Shah Abdali. An entire generation of Maratha leaders lay dead on the battlefield as a result of that conflict. However, between 1761 and 1773, the Marathas regained the lost ground in the north. =Anglo-Maratha relations= The Maratha gains in the north were undone because of the contradictory policies of Holkar and Shinde and the internal disputes in the family of the Peshwa, which culminated in the murder of Narayanrao Peshwa in 1773. Raghunathrao was ousted from the seat of Peshwa due to continuing internal Maratha rivalries. He sought help from the British, and they signed the Treaty of Surat with him in March 1775. This treaty gave him military assistance in exchange for control of Salsette Island and Bassein Fort. The treaty set off discussions amongst the British in India as well as in Europe because of the serious implications of a confrontation with the powerful Marathas. Another cause for concern was that the Bombay Council had exceeded its constitutional authority by signing such a treaty. The treaty was the cause of the start of the First Anglo-Maratha War. This war was virtually a stalemate, with no side being able to defeat the other. The war concluded with the treaty of Salabai in May 1782, mediated by Mahadji Shinde. The foresight of Warren Hastings was the main reason for the success of the British in the war. He had destroyed the anti-British coalition and created a division between the Shinde, the Bhonsle, and the Peshwa. The Marathas were still in a very strong position when the new Governor General of British controlled territories Cornwallis arrived in India in 1786. After the treaty of Salabai, the British followed a policy of coexistence in the north. The British and the Marathas enjoyed more than two decades of peace, thanks to the diplomacy of Nana Phadnavis, a minister in the court of the 11-year-old Peshwa Sawai Madhavrao. The situation changed soon after Nana's death in 1800. The power struggle between Holkar and Shinde caused Holkar to attack the Peshwa in Pune in 1801, since the Peshwa sided with Shinde. The Peshwa Baji Rao II fled Pune to safety on a British warship. Baji Rao feared loss of his own powers and signed the treaty of Bassein. This made the Peshwa in effect a subsidiary ally of the British. In response to the treaty, the Bhonsle and Shinde attacked the British, refusing to accept the betrayal of their sovereignty to the British by the Peshwa. This was the start of the Second Anglo-Maratha War in 1803. Both were defeated by the British, and all Maratha leaders lost large parts of their territory to the British. =The British East India Company= The British had travelled thousands of miles to arrive in India. They studied Indian geography and mastered local languages to deal with the Indians. At the time, they were technologically advanced, with superior equipment in several critical areas to that available locally. Chhabra hypothesizes that even if the British technical superiority were discounted, they would have won the war because of the discipline and organization in their ranks. After the First Anglo-Maratha war, Warren Hastings declared in 1783 that the peace established with the Marathas was on such a firm ground that it was not going to be shaken for years to come. The British believed that a new permanent approach was needed to establish and maintain continuous contact with the Peshwa's court in Pune. The British appointed Charles Malet, a senior merchant from Bombay, to be a permanent Resident at Pune because of his knowledge of the languages and customs of the region. Prelude The Maratha Empire had partly declined due to the Second Anglo-Maratha War. Efforts to modernize the armies were half- hearted and undisciplined: newer techniques were not absorbed by the soldiers, while the older methods and experience were outdated and obsolete. The Maratha Empire lacked an efficient spy system, and had weak diplomacy compared to the British. Maratha artillery was outdated, and weapons were imported. Foreign officers were responsible for the handling of the imported guns; the Marathas never used their own men in considerable numbers for the purpose. Although Maratha infantry was praised by the likes of Wellington, they were poorly led by their generals and heavily relied on mercenaries (known as Pindaris). The confederate-like structure that evolved within the empire created a lack of unity needed for the wars. Mountstuart Elphinstone At the time of the war, the power of the British East India Company was on the rise, whereas the Maratha Empire was on the decline. The British had been victorious in the previous Anglo-Maratha war and the Marathas were at their mercy. The Peshwa of the Maratha Empire at this time was Baji Rao II. Several Maratha leaders who had formerly sided with the Peshwa were now under British control or protection. The British had an arrangement with the Gaekwad dynasty of the Maratha province of Baroda to prevent the Peshwa from collecting revenue in that province. Gaekwad sent an envoy to the Peshwa in Pune to negotiate a dispute regarding revenue collection. The envoy, Gangadhar Shastri, was under British protection. He was murdered, and the Peshwa's minister Trimbak Dengle was suspected of the crime. The British seized the opportunity to force Baji Rao into a treaty. The treaty (The Treaty of Pune) was signed on 13 June 1817. Key terms imposed on the Peshwa included the admission of Dengle's guilt, renouncing claims on Gaekwad, and surrender of significant swaths of territory to the British. These included his most important strongholds in the Deccan, the seaboard of Konkan, and all places north of the Narmada and south of the Tungabhadra rivers. The Peshwa was also not to communicate with any other powers in India. The British Resident Mountstuart Elphinstone also asked the Peshwa to disband his cavalry. =Maratha planning= Ruins of the old palace at Raigad fort The Peshwa disbanded his cavalry, but secretly asked them to stand by, and offered them seven months' advance pay. Baji Rao entrusted Bapu Gokhale with preparations for war. In August 1817, the forts at Sinhagad, Raigad, and Purandar were fortified by the Peshwa. Gokhale secretly recruited troops for the impending war. Many Bhils and Ramoshis were hired. Efforts were made to unify Bhonsle, Shinde, and Holkar; even the mercenary Pindaris were approached. The Peshwa identified unhappy Marathas in the service of the British Resident Elphinstone and secretly recruited them. One such person was Jaswant Rao Ghorpade. Efforts were made to secretly recruit Europeans as well, which failed. Some people, such as Balaji Pant Natu, stood steadfastly with the British. Several of the sepoys rejected the Peshwa's offers, and others reported the matter to their superior officers. On 19 October 1817, Baji Rao II celebrated the Dassera festival in Pune, where troops were assembled in large numbers. During the celebrations, a large flank of the Maratha cavalry pretended they were charging towards the British sepoys but wheeled off at the last minute. This display was intended as a slight towards Elphinstone and as a scare tactic to prompt the defection and recruitment of British sepoys to the Peshwa's side. The Peshwa made plans to kill Elphinstone, despite opposition from Gokhale. Elphinstone was fully aware of these developments thanks to the espionage work of Balaji Pant Natu and Ghorpade. Burton provides an estimate of the strength of various Maratha powers in or around 1817: He estimated the various Maratha powers totals to 81,000 infantry, 106,000 horse or cavalry and 589 guns. Of these the Peshwa had the highest number of cavalry at 28,000, along with 14,000 infantry and 37 guns. The Peshwa headquarters was in Pune, which was the southernmost location amongst the other Maratha powers. Holkar had the second largest cavalry, amounting to 20,000, and an infantry force of 8,000. His guns totaled to 107 guns. Shinde and Bhonsle had similar numbers of cavalry and infantry, with each having 15,000 and 16,000 cavalry, respectively. Shinde had 16,000 infantry and Bhonsle, 18,000. Shinde had the larger share of guns amounting to 140 whereas Bhonsle had 85. Holkar, Shinde and Bhonsle were headquartered in Indore, Gwalior and Nagpur respectively. The Afghan leader Amir Khan was located in Tonk in Rajputana and his strength was 12,000 cavalry, 10,000 infantry and 200 guns. The Pindaris were located north of the Narmada valley in Chambal and Malwa region of central India. Three Pindari leaders sided with Shinde, these were Setu, Karim Khan and Dost Mohammad. They were mostly horsemen with strengths of 10,000, 6,000 and 4,000. The rest of the Pindari chiefs, Tulsi, Imam Baksh, Sahib Khan, Kadir Baksh, Nathu and Bapu were allied with Holkar. Tulsi and Imam Baksh each had 2,000 horsemen, Kadir Baksh, 21,500. Sahib Khan, Nathu and Bapu had 1,000, 750 and 150 horsemen. Commencement Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley, who rapidly expanded the Company's territories with victories in the Anglo-Maratha Wars The Peshwa's territory was in an area called the Desha, now part of the modern state of Maharashtra. The region consists of the valleys of the Krishna and Godavari rivers and the plateaus of the Sahyadri Mountains. Shinde's territory around Gwalior and Bundelkhand was a region of rolling hills and fertile valleys that slopes down toward the Indo-Gangetic Plain to the north. The Pindari territory was the valleys and forests of the Chambal, the north western region of the modern state of Madhya Pradesh. It was a mountainous region with a harsh climate. The Pindaris also operated from Malwa, a plateau region in the north west of the state of Madhya Pradesh, north of the Vindhya Range. Holkar was based in the upper Narmada River valley. The war was mostly a mopping-up operation intended to complete the expansion of the earlier Anglo-Maratha war, which was stopped due to economic concerns of the British. The war began as a campaign against the Pindaris. Seeing that the British were in conflict with the Pindaris, the Peshwa's forces attacked the British at 16:00 on 5 November 1817 with the Maratha left attacking the British right. The Maratha forces comprised 20,000 cavalry, 8,000 infantry, and 20 guns whereas the British had 2,000 cavalry, 1,000 infantry, and eight guns. On the Maratha side, an additional 5,000 horse and 1,000 infantry were guarding the Peshwa at Parvati Hill. The British numbers include Captain Ford's unit, which was en route from Dapodi to Khadki. The British had also asked General Smith to come to Khadki for the battle but they did not anticipate he would arrive in time. Three hills in the region were the Parvati Hill, the Chaturshringi Hill, and the Khadki hill. The Peshwa watched the battle from the Parvati Hill whereas the British East India Company troops were based on the Khadki hill. The two hills are separated by a distance of four kilometres. The river Mula is shallow and narrow and could be crossed at several locations. A few canals (nallas in Marathi) joined the river and though these were not obstacles, some of them were obscured due to the vegetation in the area. The Maratha army was a mix of Rohillas, Rajputs, and Marathas. It also included a small force of the Portuguese under their officer, de Pinto. The left flank of the Maratha army, commanded by Moropant Dixit and Raste, was stationed on the flat ground on which the University of Pune stands today. The centre was commanded by Bapu Gokhale and the right was under Vinchurkar. British troop movements began on 1 November 1817 when Colonel Burr moved his forces towards what is now Bund Garden via the Holkar Bridge. The Maratha were successful initially in creating and exploiting a gap in the British left and centre. These successes were nullified by the Maratha horses being thrown into disarray by a hidden canal and the temporary loss of command by Gokhale, whose horse was shot. The Marathas were rendered leaderless when Moropant Dixit on the right was shot dead. The British infantry advanced steadily, firing volley after volley, causing the Maratha cavalry to retreat in a matter of four hours. The British soon claimed victory. The British lost 86 men and the Maratha about 500. =The Pindaris= Location of Malwa in an 1823 depiction of India. Malwa was the headquarters of some of the Pindaris in the early 19th century After the second Anglo-Maratha war, Shinde and Holkar had lost many of their territories to the British. They encouraged the Pindaris to raid the British territories. The Pindaris, who were mostly cavalry, came to be known as the Shindeshahi and the Holkarshahi after the patronage they received from the respective defeated Maratha leaders. The Pindari leaders were Setu, Karim Khan, Dost Mohammad, Tulsi, Imam Baksh, Sahib Khan, Kadir Baksh, Nathu, and Bapu. Of these, Setu, Karim Khan, and Dost Mohammad belonged to Shindeshahi and the rest to Holkarshahi. The total strength of the Pindaris in 1814 was estimated at 33,000. The Pindaris frequently raided villages in Central India. The result of the Pindari raids was that Central India was being rapidly reduced to the condition of a desert because the peasants were unable to support themselves on the land. They had no option but to join the robber bands or starve. In 1815, 25,000 Pindaris entered the Madras Presidency and destroyed over 300 villages on the Coromandel coast. Another band swept the Nizam's kingdom while a third entered Malabar. Other Pindari raids on British territory followed in 1816 and 1817. Francis Rawdon-Hastings saw that there could not be peace or security in India until the predatory Pindaris were extinguished. =British planning= To lead an army against the Pindaris in the hope of engaging them in a regular battle was not possible. To effectively crush the Pindaris, they would have to be surrounded so that they could have no means of escape. Francis Rawdon-Hastings obtained authority from the British government to take action against the Pindaris while performing diplomacy with the principal Maratha leaders to act in concert with him. The Pindaris continued to have the sympathy of almost all the Maratha leaders. In 1817 Rawdon-Hastings collected the strongest British army which had yet been seen in India, numbering roughly 120,000 men. The army was assembled from two smaller armies, the Grand Army or Bengal army in the north under his personal command, and the Army of the Deccan under General Hislop in the south. The British plan was to normalize relations with the Shinde, Holkar, and Amir Khan. The three were known to be well disposed towards the Pindaris and harboured them in their territories. Shinde was secretly planning with the Peshwa and the Nepal Ministry to form a coalition against the British. His correspondence with Nepal was intercepted and presented to him in Durbar. He was forced to enter into a treaty by which he pledged to assist the British against the Pindaris and to prevent any new gangs being formed in his territory. Diplomacy, pressure, and the treaty of Gwalior kept Shinde out of the war. Amir Khan disbanded his army on condition of being guaranteed the possession of the principality of Tonk in Rajputana. He sold his guns to the British and agreed to prevent predatory gangs from operating from his territory. The army for the war was composed of two armies, the Grand Army or the Bengal Army with a strength of 40,000 troops and the Army of the Deccan with a strength of 70,400. The Grand Army was divided into three divisions and a reserve. The left division was led by Major General Marshall and the central division was under Francis Rawdon-Hastings. The reserve was under General Ochterlony. The second army, the Army of the Deccan was composed of five divisions. The divisions were led by General Hislop, Brigadier General Doveton, General Malcolm, Brigadier General Smith, Lieutenant Colonel Adams. The Army of Deccan comprised 70,400 troops, bringing the total strength of the entire composite British East India Company army to 110,400. In addition the Madras and Pune residencies each had two battalions and a detail of an artillery unit. The Madras residency had an additional three troops of the 6th Bengal Cavalry. In October and early November, the first division of the Grand Army was sent to Sind, the second to Chambal, the third to Eastern Narmada. The reserve division was used to pressurise Amir Khan. The effect of the dispatching of the first and second divisions was to cut off Shinde from his potential allies. He and Amir Khan were thus pressured into signing a treaty. The first and third division of the army of the Deccan were concentrated at Harda to hold the fords of the Narmada. The second division was used placed at Malkapur to keep a watch on the Berar Ghats. The fourth division marched to Khandesh occupying the region between Pune and Amravati (Berar) administrative divisions whereas the fifth division was placed at Hoshangabad and the reserve division was placed between the Bhima and Krishna rivers. =Attack on the Pindaris= The attack on the Pindaris was carried out as planned. The Pindaris were attacked, and their homes were surrounded and destroyed. General Hislop from the Madras Residency attacked the Pindaris from the south and drove them beyond the Narmada river, where governor general Francis Rawdon-Hastings was waiting with his army. Karim Khan surrendered to the British and was given lands in Gorakhpur. The principal routes from Central India were occupied by British detachments. The Pindari forces were completely broken up, scattered in the course of a single campaign. They made no stand against the regular troops, and even in small bands they were unable to escape the ring of forces drawn around them. The Pindaris rapidly dispersed over the country. The Pindari chiefs were reduced to the condition of hunted outlaws. The desperate Pindaris expected the Marathas to help them, but none dared to give them even a place of shelter for their families. Karim and Setu had still 23,000 men between them but such a force was no match for the armies that surrounded them. In whatever direction they turned they were met by British forces. Defeat followed defeat. One gang made their escape to the south, leaving all their baggage behind them. Many fled to the jungles and perished. Others sought refuge in the villages, but were killed without mercy by the villagers who had not forgotten the sufferings they had been inflicted upon by the Pindaris. The Pindari chiefs Karim Khan and Wasil Mohammed had been present with their Durras at the battle of Mahidpur. Since by this time the Maratha powers had been reduced significantly, the pursuit of Setu and the other leaders was resumed with vigor. All the leaders had surrendered before the end of February and the Pindari system and power was brought to a close. They were removed to Gorakhptir where they obtained grants of land for their subsistence. Karim Khan became a farmer on the small estate he received beyond the Ganges in Gorakpur. Wasil Mohammed attempted to escape. He was found and committed suicide by taking poison. Setu, a Jat by caste, was hunted by John Malcolm from place to place until he had no followers left. He vanished into the jungles of Central India in 1819 and was killed by a tiger. =Flight of the Peshwa= On the orders of Elphinstone, General Smith arrived in Yerwada near Pune on 13 November at the site of the present Deccan College. Smith and his troops crossed the river on 15 November and took up positions at Ghorpadi. On the morning of 16 November, the Marathas were engaged in a battle with the British. While the Maratha generals such as Purandare, Raste, and Bapu Gokhale were ready to advance on to the British forces, they were demoralized after learning that the Peshwa and his brother had fled to Purandar. A force of 5,000 additional Marathas was located at the confluence of two rivers‚Äîthe Mula and the Mutha‚Äîunder the leadership of Vinchurkar, but they remained idle. Bapu Gokhale retreated to guard the Peshwa in flight. The next morning, General Smith advanced towards the city of Pune and found that the Peshwa had fled towards the city of Satara. During the day Pune surrendered, and great care was taken by General Smith for the protection of the peaceful part of the community. Order was soon re-established. The British forces entered Shanivar Wada on 17 November and the Union flag was hoisted by Balaji Pant Natu. However the saffron flags of the Peshwa were not removed from Kotwali Chavdi until the defeat of Baji Rao at Ashti; it might seem that the British still believed that the war was not raised by Baji Rao but he was forced to do so under pressure from Bapu Gokhle, Trimabkji Dengle and Moreshwar Dikshit. The Peshwa now fled to the town of Koregaon. The Battle of Koregaon (also known as the battle of Koregaon Bhima) took place on 1 January 1818 on the banks of the river Bhima, north west of Pune. Captain Stauton arrived near Koregaon along with 500 infantry, two six-pounder guns, and 200 irregular horsemen. Only 24 of the infantry were of European origin; they were from the Madras Artillery. The rest of the infantry was composed of Indians employed by the British. The village of Koregaon was on the north bank of the river, which was shallow and narrow at this time of year. The village had a fortified enclosure constructed in the standard Maratha fashion. Stauton occupied the village but was unable to take the fortified enclosure, which was occupied by the Marathas. The British were cut off from the river, their only source of water. A fierce battle ensued that lasted the entire day. Streets and guns were captured and recaptured, changing hands several times. Baji Rao's commander Trimabkji killed Lt. Chishom thereby avenging the death of Govindrao Gokhle, the only son of Bapu Gokhle. The Peshwa watched the battle from atop a nearby hill about two miles away. The Marathas evacuated the village and retreated during the night. The British lost 175 men and about a third of the irregular horse, with more than half of the European officers wounded. The Marathas lost 500 to 600 men. When the British found the village evacuated in the morning, Staunton took his battered troops and pretended to march on to Pune, but actually went to Shirur. The first authentic information about the Koregaon battle shows that it was a narrow escape rather than a heroic victory for the British. \\"Accounts have been received from Lt Col Burr, dated the 3rd(January, 1818), intimating that Capt. Staunton, commanding the 2nd battalion 1st regiment of Bombay Native Infantry, had been fortunately able to commence his march back to Seroor, with 125 wounded, having buried 50 at Goregaum (sic), and left 12 or 15 there, badly wounded; that the Peshwa had proceeded Southward, General Smith in pursuit, which had probably saved the battalion.\\" \\"Interesting Intelligence from the London Gazette\\" (June 1818) page 550. After the battle the British forces under general Pritzler pursued the Peshwa, who fled southwards towards Karnataka with the Raja of Satara. The Peshwa continued his flight southward throughout the month of January. Not receiving support from the Raja of Mysore, the Peshwa doubled back and passed General Pritzler to head towards Solapur. Until 29 January the pursuit of the Peshwa had not been productive. Whenever Baji Rao was pressed by the British, Gokhale and his light troops hovered around the Peshwa and fired long shots. Some skirmishes took place, and the Marathas were frequently hit by shells from the horse artillery. There was, however, no advantageous result to either party. On 7 February General Smith entered Satara and captured the royal palace of the Marathas. He symbolically raised the British flag. The next day, the Bhagwa Zenda ‚Äîthe flag of Shivaji and the Marathas‚Äî was raised in its place. To gain the support of the population, the British declared that they would not interfere with the tenets of any religion. They announced that all Watans, Inams, pensions, and annual allowances would be continued provided that the recipients withdrew from the service of Baji Rao. During this time Baji Rao remained in the vicinity of Solapur. On 19 February, General Smith got word that the Peshwa was headed for Pandharpur. General Smith's troops attacked the Peshwa at Ashti en route. During this battle, Gokhale died while defending the Peshwa from the British. The Raja of Satara was captured along with his brother and mother. The Maratha king, first imprisoned by Tarabai in the 1750s had lost power much earlier but was reinstated by Madhav rao Peshwa in 1763 after Tarabai's death. Since then the king had retained a titular position of appointing the Peshwas. The Emperor Alamgir II in his farman to the Peshwa had complimented them for looking after the Chhatrapati family.Bharat Itihas Sanshodhan mandal Quarterly July 1920 The Chhatrapati declared in favour of the British and this ended the Peshwa's legal position as head of the Maratha confederacy, this was done by a jahirnama which stated Peshwas were no longer the head of the Maratha confederacy. However Baji Rao II challenged the jahirnama of removing him from his position as Peshwa by issuing another jahirnama removing Mountstuart Elphinstone as British Resident to his state. The death of Gokhale and the skirmish at Ashti hastened the end of the war. Soon after this Baji Rao was deserted by the Patwardhans. By 10 April 1818, General Smith's forces had taken the forts of Sinhagad and Purandar. Mountstuart Elphinstone mentions the capture of Sinhagadh in his diary entry for 13 February 1818: \\"The garrison contained no Marathas, but consisted of 100 Arabs, 600 Gosains, and 400 Konkani. The Killadar was a boy of eleven; the real Governor, Appajee Punt Sewra, a mean-looking Carcoon. The garrison was treated with great liberality; and, though there was much property and money in the place, the Killadar was allowed to have whatever he claimed as his own.\\" On 3 June 1818 Baji Rao surrendered to the British and negotiated the sum of eight lakhs as annual maintenance. Baji Rao obtained promises from the British in favor of the Jagirdars, his family, the Brahmins, and religious institutions. The Peshwa was sent to Bithur near Kanpur. While the downfall and banishment of the Peshwa was mourned all over the Maratha Empire as a national defeat, the Peshwa seemed unaffected. He contracted more marriages and spent his long life engaged in religious performances and excessive drinking. =Events in Nagpur= Sitabardi fort today Battle of Kirki, 1817 Madhoji Bhonsle, also known as Appa Saheb, consolidated his power in Nagpur after the murder of his cousin, the imbecile ruler Parsoji Bhonsle. He entered into a treaty with the British on 27 May 1816. He ignored the request of the British Resident Jenkins to refrain from contact with Baji Rao II. Jenkins asked Appa Saheb to disband his growing concentration of troops and come to the residency, which he also refused to do. Appa Saheb openly declared support for the Peshwa, who was already fighting the British near Pune. As it was now clear that a battle was in the offing, Jenkins asked for reinforcements from nearby British East India Company troops. He already had about 1,500 men under Lieutenant-Colonel Hopentoun Scott. Jenkins sent word for Colonel Adams to march to Nagpur with his troops. Like other Maratha leaders, Appa Shaeb employed Arabs in his army. They were typically involved in holding fortresses. While they were known to be among the bravest of troops, they were not amenable to discipline and order. The total strength of the Marathas was about 18,000. The Residency was to the west of the Sitabardi hill, a hillock running north‚Äìsouth. The British East India Company troops occupied the north end of the hillock. The Marathas, fighting with the Arabs, made good initial gains by charging up the hill and forcing the British to retreat to the south. British commanders began arriving with reinforcements: Lieutenant Colonel Rahan on 29 November, Major Pittman on 5 December, and Colonel Doveton on 12 December. The British counterattack was severe and Appa Saheb was forced to surrender. The British lost 300 men, of which 24 were Europeans; the Marathas lost an equal number. A treaty was signed on 9 January 1818. Appa Saheb was allowed to rule over nominal territories with several restrictions. Most of his territory, including the forts, was now controlled by the British. They built additional fortifications on Sitabardi hill. A few days later Appa Saheb was arrested. He was being escorted to Allahabad when he escaped to Punjab to seek refuge with the Sikhs. They turned him down and he was captured once again by the British near Jodhpur. Raja Mansingh of Jodhpur stood surety for him and he remained in Jodhpur, where he died on 15 July 1849 at 44 years of age. =Subjugation of Holkar= Map of India after the Third Anglo-Maratha War, 1819 Holkar was offered terms similar to those offered to Shinde; the only difference was that Holkar accepted and respected the independence of Amir Khan. The Court of Holkar was at this time practically nonexistent. When Tantia Jog, an official of the Holkar, urged acceptance of the offer he was suspected of being in collusion with the British. In reality he made the suggestion because he was aware of the power of the British as he had seen their armies in action when he had commanded a battalion in the past. Holkar responded to the Peshwa's call for insurrection against the British by initiating a battle in Mahidpur. The battle of Mahidpur between Holkar and the British was fought on 21 December 1817. The charge on the British side was led by Malcolm himself. A deadly battle ensued lasting from midday until 3:00 am. Lieutenant General Thomas Hislop was commander in chief of the Madras army. Hislop came in sight of the Holkar army about 9:00 am. The British East India Company's army lost 800 men but Holkar's force was destroyed. The British East India Company's losses were 800 killed or wounded but Holkar's loss was much larger with about 3,000 killed or wounded. These losses meant Holkar was deprived of any means of rising in arms against the British, and this broke the power of the Holkar dynasty. The battle of Mahidpur proved disastrous for the Maratha fortunes. Henry Durand wrote, \\"After the battle of Mahidpur not only the Peshwa's but the real influence of the Mahratta States of Holkar and Shinde were dissolved and replaced by British supremacy.\\" Although the power of the Holkar family was broken, the remaining troops remained hostile and a division was retained to disperse them. The ministers made overtures of peace, and on 6 January 1818 the Treaty of Mandeswar was signed; Holkar accepted the British terms in totality. Holkar came under British authority as an independent prince subject to the advice of a British Resident. End of the war and its effects The Nassak Diamond was seized from the Peshwa by the British and sent to London At the end of the war, all of the Maratha powers had surrendered to the British. Shinde and the Afghan Amir Khan were subdued by the use of diplomacy and pressure, which resulted in the Treaty of Gwailor on 5 November 1817. Under this treaty, Shinde surrendered Rajasthan to the British and agreed to help them fight the Pindaris. Amir Khan agreed to sell his guns to the British and received a land grant at Tonk in Rajputana. Holkar was defeated on 21 December 1817 and signed the Treaty of Mandeswar on 6 January 1818. Under this treaty the Holkar state became subsidiary to the British. The young Malhar Rao was raised to the throne. Bhonsle was defeated on 26 November 1817 and was captured but he escaped to live out his life in Jodhpur. The Peshwa surrendered on 3 June 1818 and was sent off to Bithur near Kanpur under the terms of the treaty signed on 3 June 1818. Of the Pindari leaders, Karim Khan surrendered to Malcolm in February 1818; Wasim Mohammad surrendered to Shinde and eventually poisoned himself; and Setu was killed by a tiger. The war left the British, under the auspices of the British East India Company, in control of virtually all of present-day India south of the Sutlej River. The famed Nassak Diamond was acquired by the Company as part of the spoils of the war. The British acquired large chunks of territory from the Maratha Empire and in effect put an end to their most dynamic opposition. The terms of surrender Malcolm offered to the Peshwa were controversial amongst the British for being too liberal: The Peshwa was offered a luxurious life near Kanpur and given a pension of about 80,000 pounds. A comparison was drawn with Napoleon, who was confined to a small rock in the south Atlantic and given a small sum for his maintenance. Trimbakji Dengale was captured after the war and was sent to the fortress of Chunarin Bengal where he spent the rest of his life. With all active resistance over, John Malcolm played a prominent part in capturing and pacifying the remaining fugitives. The Peshwa's territories were absorbed into the Bombay Presidency and the territory seized from the Pindaris became the Central Provinces of British India. The princes of Rajputana became symbolic feudal lords who accepted the British as the paramount power. Thus Francis Rawdon-Hastings redrew the map of India to a state which remained more or less unaltered until the time of Lord Dalhousie. The British brought an obscure descendant of Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha Empire, to be the ceremonial head of the Maratha Confederacy to replace the seat of the Peshwa. An infant from the Holkar family was appointed as the ruler of Nagpur under British guardianship. The Peshwa adopted a son, Nana Sahib, who went on to be one of the leaders of the Rebellion of 1857. After 1818, Montstuart Elphinstone reorganized the administrative divisions for revenue collection, thus reducing the importance of the Patil, the Deshmukh, and the Deshpande. The new government felt a need to communicate with the local Marathi-speaking population; Elphinstone pursued a policy of planned standardization of the Marathi language in the Bombay Presidency starting after 1820.

The scythed chariot was a war chariot with scythe blades mounted on each side. It was employed in ancient times. History The scythed chariot was a modified war chariot. The blades extended horizontally for about to each side of the wheels. The Greek general Xenophon (430‚àí354 BC), an eyewitness at the battle of Cunaxa, tells of them: \\"These had thin scythes extending at an angle from the axles and also under the driver's seat, turned toward the ground\\". Serrated bronze blades for chariot wheels have also been excavated from Zhou-era pre-imperial Chinese sites. Dismissing completely 17th to 19th century ideas of a Canaanite, Assyrian, Indian or Macedonian origin, Historian Alexander K. Nefiodkin challenges Xenophon's attribution of scythed chariots to the first Persian king Cyrus, pointing to their notable absence in the invasion of Greece (480‚àí479 BC) by one of his successors, Xerxes I. Instead, he argues that the Persians introduced scythed chariots sometime later during the Greco-Persian Wars, between 467 BC and 458 BC, as a response to their experience fighting against Greek heavy infantry. =Persian wars= The scythed chariot was pulled by a team of four horses and manned by a crew of up to three men, one driver and two warriors. Theoretically the scythed chariot would plow through infantry lines, cutting combatants in half or at least opening gaps in the line which could be exploited. It was difficult to get horses to charge into the tight phalanx formation of the Greek/Macedonian hoplites (infantry). The scythed chariot avoided this inherent problem for cavalry, by the scythe cutting into the formation, even when the horses avoided the men. A disciplined army could diverge as the chariot approached, and then re-form quickly behind it, allowing the chariot to pass without causing many casualties. War chariots had limited military capabilities. They were strictly an offensive weapon and were best suited against infantry in open flat country where the charioteers had room to maneuver. At a time when cavalry were without stirrups, and probably had neither spurs nor an effective saddle, though they certainly had saddle blankets, scythed chariots added weight to a cavalry attack on infantry. Historical sources come from the infantry side of such engagements i.e. the Greek and Roman side. Here is one recorded encounter where scythed chariots were on the winning side: > The soldiers had got into the habit of collecting their supplies carelessly > and without taking precautions. There was one occasion when Pharnabazus, > with 2 scythed chariots and about 400 cavalry, came on them when they were > scattered all over the plain. When the Greeks saw him bearing down on them, > they ran to join up with each other, about 700 altogether; but Pharnabazus > did not waste time. Putting the chariots in front, and following behind them > himself with the cavalry, he ordered a charge. The chariots dashing into the > Greek ranks, broke up their close formation, and the cavalry soon cut down > about a hundred men. The rest fled and took refuge with Agesilaus, who > happened to be close at hand with the hoplites.Xenophon, Hellenica > IV,1,17-19. The only other recorded example of their successful use seems to be when units of Mithradates VI of Pontus defeated a Bithynian force on the River Amnias in 89 BC. (Appian) =Roman encounters= The statue Boadicea and Her Daughters near Westminster Pier shows British Celtic queen Boudica in a scythed chariot as commissioned by Prince Albert and executed by Thomas Thornycroft (completed in 1905). Despite these shortcomings, scythed chariots were used with some success by the Persians and the kingdoms of the Hellenistic Era. They are last known to have been used at the Battle of Zela in 47 BC. The Romans are reported to have defeated this weapon system, not necessarily at this battle, with caltrops. On other occasions the Romans fixed vertical posts in the ground behind which their infantry were safe (Frontinus Stratagems 2,3,17-18) There is a statement in the Scriptores Historiae Augustae Severus Alexander LV that he captured 1,800 scythed chariots. This is universally regarded as false. Late in the Imperial period, the Romans might have experimented with an unusual variant of the idea that called for cataphract-style lancers to sit on a pair or a single horse drawing a \\"chariot\\" reduced to a bare axle with wheels, where the blades were only lowered into the fighting position at the last moment. This would have facilitated manoeuvring before battle. This at least is a reasonable interpretation of the rather enigmatic De rebus bellicis section 12-14. =Saharan tribes= In the northern Sahara nomadic tribes called Pharusii and Nigrites used scythed chariots c. 22 AD, as Strabo reports: \\"They have chariots also, armed with scythes.\\" Strabo, Geography, XVII.iii. =Celtic Britain and Ireland= Regarding the Roman conquest of Britain, contemporary Roman geographer Pomponius Mela mentions: > They make war not only on horseback but also from 2 horse chariots and cars > armed in the Gallic fashion ‚Äì they call them covinni ‚Äì on which they use > axles equipped with scythes.Pomponius Mela, 3,52 (c. 44 AD). No one knows how much value to give to this statement. There is the deep suspicion that it reflects Claudian propaganda to add glory to the Roman invasion of Britain by making the Britons more sophisticated than they were. There is no accepted archaeological evidence concerning scythed chariots. There are some large heavy scythe blades from late Roman Britain which are too unwieldy for a man to use. Da Vinci's Scythed Chariot However, a scythed chariot appears in The Cattle-Raid of Cooley (T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge), the central epic of the Ulster cycle of Early Irish literature.Scythed chariot, from The Cattle-Raid of Cooley (T√°in B√≥ C√∫alnge) =Leonardo da Vinci= One of Leonardo da Vinci's ideas was a scythed chariot.

Duncan developed the story from the character of Mark, who is involved in the kidnapping plan and is based on the first boyfriend of Duncan's oldest daughter. Mr. Griffin was based on the personality of a teacher one of Duncan's daughters had in high school. In 2010, the novel was reissued with changes to modernize the content. The book won several awards and honors, including the 1982 Massachusetts Children's Book Award and the 1982‚Äì1983 Alabama Camellia Children's Choice Book Award. Killing Mr. Griffin was adapted into a television film of the same name that aired on NBC on April 7, 1997. The film starred Jay Thomas, Amy Jo Johnson, Mario Lopez and Scott Bairstow, and was first released on DVD and VHS on March 7, 2000. Plot Brian Griffin is a strict high school English teacher at Del Norte High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico, who never accepts late homework and is demanding of his students. When Mark Kinney, one of the students in his class, plagiarizes a paper, Mr. Griffin makes him beg to be allowed back into the class. However, instead of allowing him back in, Mr. Griffin decides to make him repeat the class next semester. Fellow students in the class he is repeating include David Ruggles, Jeff Garrett and Betsy Cline. Susan McConell is an A+ student on average, but is constantly receiving below average B's in his class. Mark suggests kidnapping Mr. Griffin, and convinces David, Jeff, and Betsy to join in on the plan as a way of scaring him and getting revenge because they feel he has treated them poorly. The group decides to use Susan, who is least willing to participate in the plot, to distract Mr. Griffin by requesting a conference with him after school. Since Susan is one of his better-performing students with a serious approach to her studies, Mr. Griffin willingly does so, allowing her to walk him to his car afterwards. Jeff, David, and Mark forcefully place a bag over Mr. Griffin's head and tie him up, replacing the bag with a blindfold as they take him to a remote spot in the mountains. Betsy, thanks to a speeding ticket, arrives in the parking lot after the boys have left with Mr. Griffin. Susan was supposed to ride with Betsy but does not want any further part in the scheme, and Betsy leaves without her. Mark tells Mr. Griffin to beg, but he refuses, so the students decide to leave him alone there until midnight. Susan and David defy the group and go check on Mr. Griffin. The two find him dead as a result of coronary arrest after being unable to take his medication for angina. Mark convinces the rest of the group to cover up the death. He instructs Susan, who was the last one known to the police to see Mr. Griffin, to tell them Mr. Griffin kept looking at his watch during the conference and left with a pretty woman. Jeff, Mark, and David bury the body in the mountains. Betsy and David also drive Mr. Griffin's car to the airport, but the officer who gave Betsy a ticket sees her there. Worried that the officer might later identify the car as Mr. Griffin's, Jeff and Betsy move the car into Jeff's garage so he can repaint it before they hide it elsewhere. Mark's ex-girlfriend, Lana Turnboldt, has a picnic with her fianc√© at the secluded place in the mountains, where they discover Mr. Griffin's medicine bottle. The police investigate, and find Mr. Griffin's body buried nearby. However, police do not find the ring Mr. Griffin was wearing when he died as David had taken it. Irma Ruggles, David's paternal grandmother who lives with him, discovers the ring and refuses to give it back to him, believing the ring to be that of David's father who had left him. David tells Susan he took the ring and his grandmother found it, but they are unsuccessful at retrieving it from her, so Susan tells Mark about the situation because she feels he would know what to do. Irma Ruggles is later murdered, and a neighbor refers to the suspect as a boy in a brown sweater. Susan makes the connection, knowing that Mark has a brown sweater he wears all the time, and that Mark would stop at nothing to get what he needed ‚Äì in this case, the ring. Susan plans to tell the police all that the group has done. Before she can inform the police, Mark, Jeff, and Betsy tie Susan up, and Jeff and Betsy leave to hide Mr. Griffin's car. Mark sets her curtains on fire, but Susan is saved by Kathy Griffin,In the first edition of the novel her name is spelled Kathy, which is the spelling used here. The 2010 revised edition of the novel () spells her name Cathy. Mr. Griffin's wife, who came over to her house with a detective for an interview. The detective catches Mark as he attempts to leave the house through a window. Several days later, Susan's mother tells her that all of those involved will face varying criminal charges, with her lawyer attempting to get Susan off with no charges in exchange for testimony. Mark will face three trials, one each for the deaths of Mr. Griffin and David's grandmother, and one for the attempted murder of Susan. Mrs. Griffin leaves Susan a note that her husband had written before his death, praising Susan for her work and recognizing her potential. Characters *Mr. Griffin ‚Äì The former assistant professor of the University of Albuquerque who obtained his master's degree in English from Stanford University. He became a high school English teacher because he felt high schools were lacking good teachers. He is married to Kathy Griffin, who is expecting their first child. *Susan \\"Sue\\" McConnell ‚Äì A junior who was a straight-A student before taking Mr. Griffin's class, where she is earning B's. She has a crush on David. *Mark Kinney ‚Äì A mentally unstable teen who exhibits many of the signs of psychopathy. He was adopted by his aunt and uncle after his father was killed in a fire and his mother told him she never wanted to see him again. *Jeff Garrett ‚Äì A basketball player at Del Norte High School who is dating Betsy. *Betsy Cline ‚Äì The head cheerleader, Jeff's girlfriend, and the only child of the county commissioner, Harold Cline and his wife Liz. She is in love with Mark, yet he is uninterested in her. *David \\"Dave\\" Ruggles ‚Äì The senior class president who lives with his mother and grandmother. Many readers have asked Duncan whether he is Mr. Griffin's son, which is not stated in the book, and Duncan confirmed this is not true. Background The story developed from the character of Mark, who is based on the first boyfriend of Duncan's oldest daughter. Duncan says he \\"was a very sick young man, and he was the most charming young man you could ever meet\\", but that it \\"wasn't until things got very bad that we discovered he was the kind of guy who would swerve in the road to run over a dog.\\" She began to wonder what might happen if a charismatic teenage psychopath was placed in a high school setting and the young people he would attract as followers. 'Then I thought \\"What could he make them do?\\" The book moved from there.' Mr. Griffin was based on the personality of a drama teacher one of Duncan's daughters had in high school who \\"was very strict and demanded that her students do the best work they were capable of doing\\", but for whom Duncan's daughter was later grateful. Duncan wanted the character to be symbolic of a teacher who is not appreciated at the time but later is. Killing Mr. Griffin was first published in April 1978 by Little, Brown and Company in hardcover. In October 2010, Little, Brown reissued the novel in paperback with updates to modernize some of the content. Killing Mr. Griffin, along with I Know What You Did Last Summer and Don't Look Behind You, were the first group of 10 different titles that were updated and reissued with these changes. An audiobook was released by Listening Library in 1986, and another, read by Ed Sala, was released by Recorded Books in 1998. A reviewer from AudioFile felt that Sala's narration was effective, although occasionally he \\"seems to lose concentration and expression.\\" A 2010 audiobook, narrated by Dennis Holland, was published by Hachette Audio and features the modernized text. Major themes In the letter Mr. Griffin wrote for Susan, he comments, \\"It is indeed the little deaths, the small daily rejections of our well meant offerings that render the soul lifeless.\\" Duncan refers to this as one of the main themes in the novel, adding that the students \\"were killing [Mr. Griffin]'s soul before they killed him physically.\\" Killing Mr. Griffin also explores the downsides of peer pressure. Due to Susan's desire for peer acceptance, she becomes involved in the plan to kidnap Mr. Griffin. The group has to deal with a result they did not anticipate for the kidnapping ‚Äì Mr. Griffin's death. They have to cover up the crime while preventing Susan from revealing to the police what they have done. Reception Killing Mr. Griffin has received several honors and awards. In 1978, Killing Mr. Griffin was selected as an American Library Association (ALA) Best Book for Young Adults. It was nominated for the 1981 California Young Reader Medal in the Young Adult category and in 1982 it won the Massachusetts Children's Book Award. It was also given the 1982‚Äì1983 Alabama Camellia Children's Choice Book Award in the grade 7‚Äì9 category. However, some people have objected to including Killing Mr. Griffin in schools and libraries; the novel was 64th in ALA's list of most frequently challenged books from 1990‚Äì1999, and 25th in its list of most challenged/banned books from 2000‚Äì2009. According to the ALA, Killing Mr. Griffin was the fourth most challenged book of 2000 for \\"violence and sexual content\\". Drew Stevenson, writing for School Library Journal, stated that \\"skillful plotting builds layers of tension that draws readers into the eye of the conflict\\" and that the ending \\"is nicely handled in a manner which provides relief without removing any of the chilling implications.\\" Zena Sutherland from Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books commented that the \\"end is logical, the construction of the plot and the relationships among the well-drawn characters is solid, and the story has pace and suspense.\\" The New York Timess Richard Peck felt that the book's value \\"lies in the twisted logic of the teen‚Äêagers and how easily they can justify anything\\", but that \\"the plot descends into unadulterated melo-drama.\\" He stated that Killing Mr. Griffin 'becomes \\"an easy read\\" when it shouldn't', although \\"there's veracity unto the end: the parents are the last to lose their innocence.\\" Adaptation The book was adapted into a television film of the same title which first aired April 7, 1997, on NBC. It received a Nielsen rating of 10.7 and was viewed in 10.4 million households. The film starred Scott Bairstow as Mark Kinney, Amy Jo Johnson as Susan McConnell, Mario Lopez as David Ruggles, and Jay Thomas as Mr. Griffin, and was directed by Jack Bender. Maitland McDonagh from TV Guide gave the film two stars out of four, stating \\"this tale wraps serious issues ‚Äî peer pressure and the desire for social acceptance ‚Äî in an entertaining crime- thriller tale that never seems entirely outlandish.\\" She thought the story's rhythm was \\"disrupted by commercial-television pacing\\", but felt the cast, especially Johnson, delivered a strong performance. Killing Mr. Griffin was first released on VHS and DVD on March 7, 2000.

Birgeneau physicist and university administrator. He was the ninth chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley from 2004-13, and the fourteenth president of the University of Toronto from 2000-04. Biography The first from his family to finish high school, Birgeneau graduated from St. Michael's College School in Toronto. He received a B.Sc in mathematics in 1963 from St. Michael's College in the University of Toronto, where he also met his wife Mary Catherine; they have four children. Birgeneau received his Ph.D in physics from Yale University in 1966 for thesis titled Magnetic Interactions in Rare-Earth Insulators under the supervision of Werner P. Wolf. He spent a year each on the faculties of Yale and the University of Oxford. From 1968 to 1975, he worked at AT&T; Bell Laboratories. =MIT= He then joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a professor of physics. During his 25 years at MIT, he served as Chair of the Physics Department and ultimately as Dean of Science. =University of Toronto= He was then appointed to serve as the President of the University of Toronto, a role he held from 2000 to 2004. Birgeneau appointed Shirley Neuman as Vice President and Provost (chief academic officer) in July 2002, but she resigned on February 2, 2004, after just 19 months on the post. It was reported that Neuman‚Äôs head-strong approach alienated her from colleagues and students, and there were also tensions between Birgeneau and herself.} He left the University of Toronto after only four years of his term (despite the fact that his five-year term had been extended to seven years on his own request), causing a flurry of controversy with his abrupt departure. =UC Berkeley= He was recommended to the UC Board of Regents by Robert Dynes, then President of the UC system and a former colleague of Birgeneau when both worked at AT&T; Bell Laboratories. Birgeneau has used his platform as Chancellor to make contributions to several political debates. On June 14, 2007, Birgeneau joined the President of Columbia University in condemning Britain's University and College Union for boycotting Israeli academics and academic institutions and insisting that any boycott include their universities. Citing the \\"likely\\" threat to California's academic competitiveness if Proposition 8 were passed, Birgeneau urged the UC Berkeley community to vote against a 2008 state ballot measure which would eliminate the right of gays and lesbians to marry. During the 2011-2012 academic year, he sent campus wide messages in support of the California Dream Act, which allows undocumented students to qualify for financial aid, the reform of Proposition 13, which would close corporate property tax loopholes passed by voters in the late 1970s and reallocate that funding to social services, including higher education, and the repeal of Proposition 209, which would reenact affirmative action and significantly increase diversity in the nation's public higher education institutions. Also during the 2011-2012 academic year, Birgeneau unveiled Berkeley MCAP, the Middle Class Access Plan, a new financial aid model that caps the total annual cost of an eligible students' education - from tuition and fees to expenses including room, board and books - at 15 percent of the family's total income. Families with incomes from $80,000 to $140,000 and assets typical of that range are eligible for the program, which will provide grants beginning with the fall 2012 semester. While the UC-wide Blue and Gold program aids lower-income families, this is the first program of its kind in the system to benefit the middle class. It also served as impetus for the statewide Middle Class Scholarship program, announced by California Assembly Speaker John Perez. Birgeneau was succeeded by Nicholas Dirks as chancellor of UC Berkeley on June 1, 2013.  References External links *Official site of Chancellor Robert J.

Early life Known as \\"Sandy\\", he was born on 7 October 1788 in Scotland. He was the eldest son of merchant Thomas Bannerman (1743‚Äì1820) and his wife, Jean (n√©e Simson) Bannerman (1745‚Äì1817), who married in 1779. His younger brother, Thomas, was the father of Sir George Bannerman, 10th Baronet and grandfather of Sir Alexander Bannerman, 11th Baronet. His maternal grandfather was George Simson of Hazlehead. His paternal grandparents were Aberdeen merchant Alexander Bannerman and Margaret (n√©e Burnett) Bannerman. His uncle was Sir Alexander Bannerman, 6th Baronet. Bannerman was a prominent businessman in his hometown of Aberdeen managing the family wine business as well as having a hand in trading and whaling. Bannerman served as the city's provost and in 1837, was elected dean of Marischal College, Aberdeen. Career Alexander Bannerman joined the town council of Aberdeen in 1811. He was a reformer, challenging the long-standing oligarchy led by James and Gavin Hadden, and was instrumental in establishing an elected trust to manage the new Aberdeen Harbour.Fry, Michael (2013), A New Race of Men: Scotland 1815 - 1914, Birlinn, Edinburgh, pp. 137-143 In 1832 he became Member of Parliament (MP) for Aberdeen in the British House of Commons, sitting as a Radical, and remained an MP until his retirement in 1847. Together with his wife, Margaret Gordon the granddaughter of former Governor Walter Patterson, Bannerman returned to the colony of her birth, when he took up the appointment in 1851 as governor of Prince Edward Island. On this occasion he was made a Knight Bachelor. Bannerman instituted responsible government on the island but was removed in 1854 due to political unrest in which he favoured the Reformers. Subsequently, he was governor of the Bahamas until 1857, when he returned north to become governor of Newfoundland, the second governor since responsible government had been granted. He clashed with John Kent, the premier of Newfoundland, who he felt was corrupt. Bannerman accused Kent's government, as did Bishop Mullock, of using relief aid as patronage and also accused Kent of being unreasonable in negotiations with France over the French Shore. In 1861, after Kent had accused Bannerman of conspiring with the courts and opposition Conservative Party of Newfoundland against a proposal to reduce the salaries of judges, Bannerman dismissed the Kent government and appointed the leader of the opposition, Hugh Hoyles as the new Premier. Kent's Liberal Party of Newfoundland defeated the Conservative government in a Motion of No Confidence resulting in an election campaign that was fought along sectarian lines with Catholics largely voting Liberal and Protestants largely voting Conservative. The Protestant Conservative Party of Newfoundland narrowly defeated Kent's Liberals. Extensive rioting led to disputed results, with the Conservatives having a majority of only two until in a peaceful by-election Harbour Grace returned two Conservatives. Bannerman' initial action in dismissing Kent had been rash and the Colonial Office told him so, but Hoyles, the new Premier, moved towards non-sectarian government, both bishops called for order, and the politics of class replaced the politics of religion. Bannerman resigned as governor in 1864 and returned to England. Personal life In 1825, Bannerman married Margaret Gordon, a daughter of Guthrie Gordon, Esq. Lady Bannerman, as she was known, was born in Charlottetown on Prince Edward Island, and was a granddaughter of Walter Patterson who had been the Island's first governor. She was later identified as \\"Carlyle's first love\\" by her biographer, who tells of the young schoolmaster Thomas Carlyle, in Kirkcaldy, Scotland, \\"who was attracted by her intelligence and wit.\\" Her family considered Carlyle as an unsuitable marriage prospect, and she eventually married Bannerman, a distant cousin. While in England, he caught a cold and, in his enfeebled state, fell down a flight of stairs causing his death on 30 December 1864 in Mayfair, London aged 76. =Legacy= Bannerman Park in St. John's commemorates his name in Newfoundland.

Following creation of Texas Air, controlled by Jet Capital in mid-1980, Texas Air launched the first new airline under deregulation, New York Air, late that year. New York Air was designed as a competitor against Eastern Airlines in the shuttle markets of New York-Washington-Boston and went on to become a successful carrier in the Northeast with its low-cost, high-quality service.

The story is set in the fictional Hotel Mon Signor in Los Angeles on New Year's Eve. Tim Roth plays Ted, the bellhop and main character in the frame story, whose first night on the job consists of four very different encounters with various hotel guests. The film received negative reviews from critics who praised the segments directed by Rodriguez and Tarantino but heavily criticized the segments by Anders and Rockwell. Plot On New Year's Eve, bellhop Sam (Marc Lawrence) of the Hotel Mon Signor briefs his replacement, Ted (Tim Roth). The film's animated opening credits, inspired by the cartoons of The Pink Panther Show, feature the scat song \\"Vertigogo\\" by Combustible Edison. =Honeymoon Suite ‚Äì \\"The Missing Ingredient\\"= *Written and directed by Allison Anders Ted assists a group of unusual women with their luggage, which he brings to the Honeymoon Suite. He learns they are a coven of witches, attempting to reverse a spell cast on their goddess, Diana (Amanda De Cadenet). The ritual requires them each to place an ingredient into a large cauldron; however, one (Ione Skye) has still to retrieve her ingredient ‚Äì semen ‚Äì with one hour left. She seduces Ted and they have sex in the cauldron. He leaves and they complete the ritual, and Diana emerges from the cauldron. After Ted's service in the honeymoon suite, a party guest from another room (Lawrence Bender) calls the front desk for some ice. He is unsure which floor he is on, but eventually directs Ted to Room 404. =Room 404 ‚Äì \\"The Wrong Man\\"= *Written and directed by Alexandre Rockwell At Room 404, Ted finds himself in a fantasy hostage situation. Sigfried (David Proval) maniacally accuses Ted, whom he calls Theodore, of having slept with his wife Angela (Jennifer Beals). Ted is forced at gunpoint to participate in the scenario, uncertain what is real. He becomes stuck in the bathroom window as the party guest appears in the window above, uttering the word \\"ice\\" and vomiting. Ted escapes, just as another guest (Paul Skemp) arrives, looking for Room 404, and is greeted by Sigfried in the same manner. =Room 309 ‚Äì \\"The Misbehavers\\"= *Written and directed by Robert Rodriguez A husband (Antonio Banderas) and wife (Tamlyn Tomita) leave for a New Year's Eve party, tipping Ted $500 to keep an eye on their children, Sarah and Juancho (Lana McKissack and Danny Verduzco). Ted instructs the children to stay in their room; when he leaves, they vandalize the room, exploding a bottle of champagne. They call Ted for toothbrushes, and he tries unsuccessfully to put them to bed. He leaves but is summoned back to find the room in further chaos: a painting has been turned into a dartboard with lipstick and a syringe, Juancho has a cigarette, Sarah has a bottle of liquor, the television is set to an adult channel, and the children have found a dead prostitute (Patricia Vonne) in the box spring. Sarah stabs Ted in the leg with the syringe when he repeatedly uses the word \\"whore\\" and Juancho accidentally sets the room on fire. Their father returns, carrying his passed-out wife, and asks Ted, \\"Did they misbehave?\\" The sprinkler system activates while everyone stands still. Unsettled, Ted calls his boss Betty (Kathy Griffin) to quit. After a conversation with Margaret (Marisa Tomei), he gets Betty on the phone and tries to quit, but receives a call from the hotel penthouse. Betty convinces him to stay and tend to the guests. =Penthouse ‚Äì \\"The Man from Hollywood\\"= *Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, adapted from \\"Man from the South\\" by Roald Dahl The penthouse is occupied by famous director Chester Rush (Tarantino) and his friends, including Angela. They request a block of wood, a doughnut, a ball of twine, three nails, a club sandwich, a bucket of ice, and a hatchet \\"as sharp as the Devil himself\\". Ted is invited to join their challenge: Chester's friend Norman (Paul Calder√≥n) has bet he can light his Zippo cigarette lighter ten times in a row; if Norman succeeds, he will win Chester's car, but if he fails, his pinky will be cut off. Ted, asked to \\"wield the hatchet\\" should Norman fail, tries to leave, but Chester offers $100 up front and another $1,000 to perform his assigned role.

It is an important building in the history of modern architecture, known for its simple form and its spectacular use of extravagant materials, such as marble, red onyx and travertine. The same features of minimalism and spectacular can be applied to the prestigious furniture specifically designed for the building, including the iconic Barcelona chair. It has inspired many important modernist buildings. Concept Mies and Reich were offered the commission of this building in 1928 after his successful administration of the 1927 Werkbund exhibition in Stuttgart. The German Republic entrusted Mies with the artistic management and erection of not only the Barcelona Pavilion, but for the buildings for all the German sections at the 1929 International Exhibition. However, Mies had severe time constraints‚Äîhe had to design the Barcelona Pavilion in less than a year‚Äîand was also dealing with uncertain economic conditions. In the years following World War I, Germany started to turn around. The economy started to recover after the 1924 Dawes Plan. The pavilion for the International Exhibition was supposed to represent the new Weimar Germany: democratic, culturally progressive, prospering, and thoroughly pacifist; a self-portrait through architecture. The Commissioner, Georg von Schnitzler said it should give \\"voice to the spirit of a new era\\". This concept was carried out with the realization of the \\"Free plan\\" and the \\"Floating roof\\". Building Plan of the Barcelona Pavilion Mies's response to the proposal by von Schnitzler was radical. After rejecting the original site for aesthetic reasons, Mies agreed to a quiet site at the narrow side of a wide, diagonal axis, where the pavilion would still offer viewpoints and a route leading to one of the exhibition's main attractions, the Poble Espanyol. The pavilion was to be bare, with no exhibits, leaving only the structure accompanying a single sculpture and specially-designed furniture (the Barcelona Chair). This lack of accommodation enabled Mies to treat the Pavilion as a continuous space; blurring inside and outside. \\"The design was predicated on an absolute distinction between structure and enclosure‚Äîa regular grid of cruciform steel columns interspersed by freely spaced planes\\". However, the structure was more of a hybrid style, some of these planes also acted as supports. The floor plan is very simple. The entire building rests on a plinth of travertine. A southern U-shaped enclosure, also of travertine, helps form a service annex and a large water basin. The floor slabs of the pavilion project out and over the pool‚Äîonce again connecting inside and out. Another U-shaped wall on the opposite side of the site also forms a smaller water basin. This is where the statue by Georg Kolbe sits. The roof plates, relatively small, are supported by the chrome-clad, cruciform columns. This gives the impression of a hovering roof. Robin Evans said that the reflective columns appear to be struggling to hold the \\"floating\\" roof plane down, not to be bearing its weight. Mies wanted this building to become \\"an ideal zone of tranquillity\\" for the weary visitor, who should be invited into the pavilion on the way to the next attraction. Since the pavilion lacked a real exhibition space, the building itself was to become the exhibit. The pavilion was designed to \\"block\\" any passage through the site, rather, one would have to go through the building. Visitors would enter by going up a few stairs, and due to the slightly sloped site, would leave at ground level in the direction of the Poble Espanyol. The visitors were not meant to be led in a straight line through the building, but to take continuous turnabouts. The walls not only created space, but also directed visitor's movements. This was achieved by wall surfaces being displaced against each other, running past each other, and creating a space that became narrower or wider. Another unique feature of this building is the exotic materials Mies chooses to use. Plates of high-grade stone materials like veneers of Tinos verde antico marble and golden onyx as well as tinted glass of grey, green, white, as well as translucent glass, perform exclusively as spatial dividers. Because this was planned as an exhibition pavilion, it was intended to exist only temporarily. The building was torn down in early 1930, not even a year after it was completed. However, thanks to black-and-white photos and original plans, a group of Catalan architects reconstructed the pavilion permanently between 1983 and 1986. Sculpture The Pavilion was not only a pioneer for construction forms with a fresh, disciplined understanding of space, but also for modelling new opportunities for an association of free art and architecture. Mies placed Georg Kolbe's Alba (\\"Dawn\\") in the small water basin, leaving the larger one all the more empty. The sculpture also ties into the highly reflective materials Mies used‚Äîhe chose the place where these optical effects would have the strongest impact; the building offers multiple views of Alba. \\"From now on, in the sense of equality for juxtaposing building and visual work, sculptures were no longer to be applied retrospectively to the building, but rather to be a part of the spatial design, to help define and interpret it. To the day, one of the most notable examples is the Barcelona Pavilion\\". Interventions programme Since the Pavilion's reconstruction in the 1980s, the Mies van der Rohe Foundation has invited leading artists and architects to temporarily alter the Pavilion. These installations and alterations, called \\"interventions\\", have kept the pavilion as a node of debate on architectural ideas and practices. The list of invited people includes architects Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa who added spiral acrylic interior walls, artist Ai Weiwei who refilled two pools with coffee and milk, Andr√©s Jaque who revealed the pavilion's so far disregarded basement and its role in hiding the daily making of the site's experience, Enric Miralles, Antoni Muntadas who brought to the pavilion the smell of the MoMA archives where its memory is preserved and Jordi Bernad√≥ who removed the pavilion's glass doors.

A non-blocking algorithm is lock-free if there is guaranteed system-wide progress, and wait-free if there is also guaranteed per-thread progress. \\"Non-blocking\\" was used as a synonym for \\"lock-free\\" in the literature until the introduction of obstruction-freedom in 2003. The word \\"non-blocking\\" was traditionally used to describe telecommunications networks that could route a connection through a set of relays \\"without having to re-arrange existing calls\\", see Clos network. Also, if the telephone exchange \\"is not defective, it can always make the connection\\", see nonblocking minimal spanning switch.  Motivation  The traditional approach to multi-threaded programming is to use locks to synchronize access to shared resources. Synchronization primitives such as mutexes, semaphores, and critical sections are all mechanisms by which a programmer can ensure that certain sections of code do not execute concurrently, if doing so would corrupt shared memory structures. If one thread attempts to acquire a lock that is already held by another thread, the thread will block until the lock is free. Blocking a thread can be undesirable for many reasons. An obvious reason is that while the thread is blocked, it cannot accomplish anything: if the blocked thread had been performing a high- priority or real-time task, it would be highly undesirable to halt its progress. Other problems are less obvious. For example, certain interactions between locks can lead to error conditions such as deadlock, livelock, and priority inversion. Using locks also involves a trade-off between coarse- grained locking, which can significantly reduce opportunities for parallelism, and fine-grained locking, which requires more careful design, increases locking overhead and is more prone to bugs. Unlike blocking algorithms, non- blocking algorithms do not suffer from these downsides, and in addition are safe for use in interrupt handlers: even though the preempted thread cannot be resumed, progress is still possible without it. In contrast, global data structures protected by mutual exclusion cannot safely be accessed in an interrupt handler, as the preempted thread may be the one holding the lock -- but this can be rectified easily by masking the interrupt request during the critical section. A lock-free data structure can be used to improve performance. A lock-free data structure increases the amount of time spent in parallel execution rather than serial execution, improving performance on a multi-core processor, because access to the shared data structure does not need to be serialized to stay coherent. Guillaume Mar√ßais, and Carl Kingsford. \\"A fast, lock-free approach for efficient parallel counting of occurrences of k-mers\\". Bioinformatics (2011) 27(6): 764-770. \\"Jellyfish mer counter\\".  Implementation  With few exceptions, non-blocking algorithms use atomic read-modify-write primitives that the hardware must provide, the most notable of which is compare and swap (CAS). Critical sections are almost always implemented using standard interfaces over these primitives (in the general case, critical sections will be blocking, even when implemented with these primitives). Until recently, all non-blocking algorithms had to be written \\"natively\\" with the underlying primitives to achieve acceptable performance. However, the emerging field of software transactional memory promises standard abstractions for writing efficient non-blocking code. Much research has also been done in providing basic data structures such as stacks, queues, sets, and hash tables. These allow programs to easily exchange data between threads asynchronously. Additionally, some non-blocking data structures are weak enough to be implemented without special atomic primitives. These exceptions include: * a single-reader single-writer ring buffer FIFO, with a size which evenly divides the overflow of one of the available unsigned integer types, can unconditionally be implemented safely using only a memory barrier * Read- copy-update with a single writer and any number of readers. (The readers are wait-free; the writer is usually lock-free, until it needs to reclaim memory). * Read-copy-update with multiple writers and any number of readers. (The readers are wait-free; multiple writers generally serialize with a lock and are not obstruction-free). Several libraries internally use lock-free techniques, libcds - C++ library of lock-free containers and safe memory reclamation schema liblfds - A library of lock-free data structures, written in C Concurrency Kit - A C library for non-blocking system design and implementation but it is difficult to write lock-free code that is correct.Herb Sutter. Herb Sutter. Herb Sutter. \\"Writing a Generalized Concurrent Queue\\". Herb Sutter. \\"The Trouble With Locks\\".  Wait-freedom  Wait-freedom is the strongest non-blocking guarantee of progress, combining guaranteed system-wide throughput with starvation-freedom. An algorithm is wait-free if every operation has a bound on the number of steps the algorithm will take before the operation completes. Anthony Williams. \\"Safety: off: How not to shoot yourself in the foot with C++ atomics\\". 2015\\\\. p. 20. This property is critical for real-time systems and is always nice to have as long as the performance cost is not too high. It was shown in the 1980s that all algorithms can be implemented wait-free, and many transformations from serial code, called universal constructions, have been demonstrated. However, the resulting performance does not in general match even na√Øve blocking designs. Several papers have since improved the performance of universal constructions, but still, their performance is far below blocking designs. Several papers have investigated the difficulty of creating wait-free algorithms. For example, it has been shown that the widely available atomic conditional primitives, CAS and LL/SC, cannot provide starvation-free implementations of many common data structures without memory costs growing linearly in the number of threads. But in practice these lower bounds do not present a real barrier as spending a cache line or exclusive reservation granule (up to 2 KB on ARM) of store per thread in the shared memory is not considered too costly for practical systems (typically the amount of store logically required is a word, but physically CAS operations on the same cache line will collide, and LL/SC operations in the same exclusive reservation granule will collide, so the amount of store physically required is greater). Wait-free algorithms were rare until 2011, both in research and in practice. However, in 2011 Kogan and Petrank presented a wait-free queue building on the CAS primitive, generally available on common hardware. Their construction expanded the lock-free queue of Michael and Scott, which is an efficient queue often used in practice. A follow-up paper by Kogan and Petrank provided a method for making wait-free algorithms fast and used this method to make the wait-free queue practically as fast as its lock-free counterpart. A subsequent paper by Timnat and Petrank provided an automatic mechanism for generating wait-free data structures from lock-free ones. Thus, wait-free implementations are now available for many data-structures.  Lock-freedom  Lock-freedom allows individual threads to starve but guarantees system-wide throughput. An algorithm is lock-free if, when the program threads are run for a sufficiently long time, at least one of the threads makes progress (for some sensible definition of progress). All wait-free algorithms are lock-free. In particular, if one thread is suspended, then a lock-free algorithm guarantees that the remaining threads can still make progress. Hence, if two threads can contend for the same mutex lock or spinlock, then the algorithm is not lock-free. (If we suspend one thread that holds the lock, then the second thread will block.) An algorithm is lock-free if infinitely often operation by some processors will succeed in a finite number of steps. For instance, if N processors are trying to execute an operation, some of the N processes will succeed in finishing the operation in a finite number of steps and others might fail and retry on failure. The difference between wait-free and lock-free is that wait-free operation by each process is guaranteed to succeed in a finite number of steps, regardless of the other processors. In general, a lock-free algorithm can run in four phases: completing one's own operation, assisting an obstructing operation, aborting an obstructing operation, and waiting. Completing one's own operation is complicated by the possibility of concurrent assistance and abortion, but is invariably the fastest path to completion. The decision about when to assist, abort or wait when an obstruction is met is the responsibility of a contention manager. This may be very simple (assist higher priority operations, abort lower priority ones), or may be more optimized to achieve better throughput, or lower the latency of prioritized operations. Correct concurrent assistance is typically the most complex part of a lock-free algorithm, and often very costly to execute: not only does the assisting thread slow down, but thanks to the mechanics of shared memory, the thread being assisted will be slowed, too, if it is still running.  Obstruction- freedom  Obstruction-freedom is the weakest natural non-blocking progress guarantee. An algorithm is obstruction-free if at any point, a single thread executed in isolation (i.e., with all obstructing threads suspended) for a bounded number of steps will complete its operation. All lock-free algorithms are obstruction-free. Obstruction-freedom demands only that any partially completed operation can be aborted and the changes made rolled back. Dropping concurrent assistance can often result in much simpler algorithms that are easier to validate. Preventing the system from continually live-locking is the task of a contention manager. Some obstruction-free algorithms use a pair of \\"consistency markers\\" in the data structure. Processes reading the data structure first read one consistency marker, then read the relevant data into an internal buffer, then read the other marker, and then compare the markers. The data is consistent if the two markers are identical. Markers may be non- identical when the read is interrupted by another process updating the data structure. In such a case, the process discards the data in the internal buffer and tries again.

It was reclassified as a Naval Sea Frontier base in 1943.military-technology.com A new naval auxiliary air station (NAAS) was established in April 1944. The naval section base and the NAAS supported the Atlantic Fleet during World War II. Both were closed after the war. In June 1948, Mayport was reestablished as a naval outlying landing field. The base area was increased to and the runway was extended in the mid 1950s. became the first capital ship to use the new aircraft carrier basin in October 1952. The base was renamed back to a Naval Auxiliary Air Station in July 1955. The naval station was extended to accommodate more ships, sailors and their families and redesignated as a naval air station in 1988. NS Mayport has grown to become the third-largest naval surface fleet concentration area in the United States. The station has a busy harbor capable of accommodating 34 ships and an runway capable of handling most aircraft in the Department of Defense inventory. Naval Station Mayport is also home to the Navy's United States Fourth Fleet, reactivated in 2008 after being deactivated in 1950. The base has historically served as the homeport to various conventionally powered aircraft carriers of the United States Atlantic Fleet, including (1960‚Äì1971), (1956‚Äì1977), (1977‚Äì1993), (1957‚Äì1994), and, most recently, (1995‚Äì2007). With the decommissioning of all conventionally-powered aircraft carriers by the U.S. Navy, no carriers are presently assigned to Mayport. However, both houses of Congress have passed legislation authorizing about US$75 million for dredging and upgrades at NAVSTA Mayport to accommodate a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier.\\"Congress okays plan to upgrade Mayport\\", Jacksonville Transportation Examiner, October 23, 2009. On January 29, 2010, the Quadrennial Defense Review Report stated that a nuclear aircraft carrier would be homeported at NAVSTA Mayport. The action will help protect the fleet against a potential terror attack, accident or natural disaster, because all east coast aircraft carriers are currently based at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, according to the report. West coast aircraft carriers are split between Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego, California, Naval Base Kitsap and Naval Station Everett in Washington state and one carrier assigned to the Forward Deployed Naval Force (FDNF) homeported at Naval Base Yokosuka, Japan. In 2009 Robert Gates, Secretary of Defense, stated, \\"Having a single (nuclear carrier) homeport has not been considered acceptable on the west coast and should not be considered acceptable on the east coast.\\" The decision was opposed by elected officials in Virginia, who would lose 3,500 sailors and their dependents, $425 million in revenue each year, and most importantly, 6,000 support jobs. The Hampton Roads Chamber of Commerce estimated the loss at 11,000 jobs and $650 million per year. Infrastructure changes and facility construction at Mayport are estimated to take five years and cost over half a billion dollars. The 2011 budget commits $590 million during the fiscal years from 2011 to 2019, so a carrier may not move to Mayport until 2019.http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2012-02-13/story/no-carrier-mayport- near-future-if-all However, an amphibious group is coming sooner. relocated to Mayport in December 2013 and and also switched their homeports to the naval station in August 2014.http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=78108 The Virginia congressional delegation has fought the loss of even one of NAVSTA Norfolk's aircraft carriers boost to their economy by citing other areas such as shipbuilding to spend the Navy's tight budget.

Name The English name Valentia Island (also spelled Valencia Island) doesn't come exactly from the Spanish city of Valencia, but from a settlement on the island called An Bhaile Inse or Beal Inse (\\"mouth of the island\\" or \\"island in the mouth of the sound\\"), which in turn could have been reinterpreted as similar to the Spanish town by Englishmen and Spaniards sailors and settlers alike (there is a grave marker to Spanish sailors lost at sea in the Catholic cemetery at Kylemore). History Telegraph Field, Valentia Island: Foilhommerum is the site of the first permanent communications link between Europe and the Americas. In October 2002, a memorial to mark the laying of the transatlantic cable to Heart's Content, Newfoundland was unveiled atop Foilhommerum Cliff. Made of Valentia slate and designed by local sculptor Alan Ryan Hall, the memorial marks the importance of the site to telegraph communications with North America from 1857 forward and to accurately linking longitude measurements in North America to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich in 1866. Valentia was the eastern terminus of the first commercially viable transatlantic telegraph cable.The Atlantic Cable, Smithsonian Institution, USA. The first attempt in 1857John R. Isaac, 1857 ‚Äî Laying the Atlantic Telegraph Cable from Ship to Shore, History of the Atlantic Cable & Undersea Communications. to land a cable from Ballycarbery Strand on the mainland just east of Valentia Island ended in disappointment. After subsequent failures of cables landed at Knightstown in 1858 and Foilhommerum Bay in 1865, the vast endeavor finally resulted in commercially viable transatlantic telegraph communications from Foilhommerum Bay to Heart's Content, Newfoundland in 1866. Transatlantic telegraph cables operated from Valentia Island for one hundred years, ending with Western Union International terminating its cable operations in 1966. Prior to the transatlantic telegraph, American longitude measurements had a uncertainty with respect to European longitudes. Because of the importance of accurate longitudes to safe navigation, the U.S. Coast Survey mounted a longitude expedition in 1866 to link longitudes in the United States accurately to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. Benjamin Gould and his partner A. T. Mosman reached Valentia on 2 October 1866. They built a temporary longitude observatory beside the Foilhommerum Cable Station to support synchronized longitude observations with Heart's Content, Newfoundland. After many rainy and cloudy days, the first transatlantic longitude signals were exchanged between Foilhommerum and Heart's Content on October 24, 1866. Saturday, May 21st 1927, Charles A. Lindbergh, on his solo flight from New York to Paris make his first landfall in Europe over Dingle Bay and Valentia island. On the 1927 Mercator chart used by the famous pilot, it was labeled Valencia. In 1993 an undergraduate geology student discovered fossilised tetrapod trackways, footprints preserved in Devonian rocks, on the north coast of the island at Dohilla (). About 385 million years ago, a primitive vertebrate passed near a river margin in the sub-equatorial river basin that is now southwestern Ireland and left prints in the damp sand. The prints were preserved by silt and sand overlying them, and were converted to rock over geological time. The Valentia Island trackways are among the oldest signs of vertebrate life on land. Places of interest right The combined features and history of the island make it an attractive tourist destination, easily accessible from the popular Ring of Kerry route. *Geokaun Mountain and Fogher Cliffs : the highest mountain on Valentia Island and the sea cliffs of on its northern face. *On the northeast of the island stands Glanleam House amid sub-tropical gardens. Protected by windbreaks from Atlantic gales and never touched by frost, these gardens provide the mildest microclimate in Ireland. Starting in the 1830s, Sir Peter George Fitzgerald, the 19th Knight of Kerry (1808‚Äì1880), planted these gardens and stocked them with a unique collection of rare and tender plants from the southern hemisphere, normally grown under glass in Ireland. The gardens are laid out in a naturalistic style as a series of walks. There are plants from South America, Australia, New Zealand (the tallest tree ferns in Europe), Chile and Japan. The gardens are memorialized in a selected golden-variegated Luma apiculata \\"Glanleam Gold\\" that originated as a sport in the garden. The gardens are open to the public. *The slate quarry which reopened in 1998 provided slates for the British Houses of Parliament. *The island also hosts a heritage centre which tells the story of the geology, human, natural and industrial history of the island, with exhibits on the Cable Station, the Marine Radio Station and the RNLI's Valentia Lifeboat Station. *The Telegraph Field (or Longitude Field) is the site of the first permanent communications link between Europe and North America Transatlantic telegraph cables operated from Valentia Island from 1866.

Valentia Island is, on average, the wettest weather station in Ireland. Valentia Island sits on the eastern edge of the Atlantic Ocean. Despite it being on the same latitude as St. Anthony in Newfoundland on the opposite side of the Atlantic Ocean, it enjoys much milder winters thanks to the moderating effect of prevailing west or south west winds, and the effects of the warming Gulf Stream current. Snow and frost are rare, and because of this the island can support many sub- tropical varieties of plants. Sport Valentia Young Islanders GAA is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club. Valentia is a popular fishing location, and Valentia waters hold the Irish records for conger eel, red sea bream, Ray's bream and lesser spotted dogfish. Notable people * Helen Blackburn who was a leading women's rights campaigner in England was born here in 1842. * Valentia was considered home to Mug Ruith, a powerful blind druid in Irish mythology. * The O'Sullivans, headed by the O'Sullivan Beare, owned much of Valentia until the 17th century. * The noted naturalist Maude Jane Delap lived and worked in Knightstown, carrying out important research into the marine life surrounding Valentia and identifying many new species. * Valentia is the home of former Gaelic footballer, Mick O'Connell and the birthplace of John J \\"Sc√©ilig\\" O'Kelly, leader of Sinn F√©in from 1926. * Gaelic footballer Ger O'Driscoll was born on Valentia Island. * The American solo rock climber Michael Reardon died on 13 July 2007 at the Fogher Cliffs of Valentia Island when he was swept out to sea following a successful climb. * Gerald Spring Rice, 6th Baron Monteagle of Brandon was brought up on the island, as were many other members of the Spring Rice family.

All three thresher shark species have been listed as vulnerable to extinction by the World Conservation Union since 2007 (IUCN). All are popular sport fish. In addition, they are hunted for their meat, livers (for shark liver oil), skin (for leather), and fins for use in shark-fin soup. Thresher shark jumping in Costa Rica They do not appear to be a threat to humans. Taxonomy The genus and family name derive from the Greek word alopex, meaning fox. As a result, the long-tailed or common thresher shark, Alopias vulpinus, is also known as the fox shark. The common name is derived from a distinctive, thresher-like tail or caudal fin which can be as long as the body of the shark itself. =Species= The three extant thresher shark species are all in the genus Alopias. The possible existence of a hitherto unrecognized fourth species was revealed during the course of a 1995 allozyme analysis by Blaise Eitner. This species is apparently found in the eastern Pacific off Baja California, and has previously been misidentified as the bigeye thresher. So far, it is only known from muscle samples from one specimen, and no aspect of its morphology has been documented. * Alopias pelagicus H.

The megamouth shark (Megachasma pelagios) was placed as the next-closest relative to these taxa, though the phylogenetic position of that species has yet to be resolved with confidence. Cladistic analyses by Compagno (1991) based on morphological characters, and Shimada (2005) based on dentition, have both corroborated this interpretation. Within the family, an analysis of allozyme variation by Eitner (1995) found the common thresher is the most basal member, with a sister relationship to a group containing the unrecognized fourth Alopias species and a clade comprising the bigeye and pelagic threshers. However, the position of the undescribed fourth species was only based on a single synapomorphy (derived group-defining character) in one specimen, so some uncertainty in its placement remains. Distribution and habitat Although occasionally sighted in shallow, inshore waters, thresher sharks are primarily pelagic; they prefer the open ocean, characteristically preferring water and less. Common threshers tend to be more prevalent in coastal waters over continental shelves. Common thresher sharks are found along the continental shelves of North America and Asia of the North Pacific, but are rare in the Central and Western Pacific. In the warmer waters of the Central and Western Pacific, bigeye and pelagic thresher sharks are more common. A thresher shark was seen on the live video feed from one of the ROVs monitoring BP's Macondo oil well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico. This is significantly deeper than the 500m previously thought to be their limit. A bigeye has also been found in the western Mediterranean, and so distribution may be wider than previously believed, or environmental factors may be forcing sharks to search for new territories. Anatomy and appearance Small purple colored thresher caught at Pacifica Pier, California Named for their exceptionally long, thresher-like heterocercal tail or caudal fins (which can be as long as the total body length), thresher sharks are active predators; the tail is used as a weapon to stun prey.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHoCCPsRuhg The thresher shark has a short head and a cone-shaped nose. The mouth is generally small, and the teeth range in size from small to large. By far the largest of the three species is the common thresher, Alopias vulpinus, which may reach a length of and a mass of over . The bigeye thresher, Alopias superciliosus, is next in size, reaching a length of 4.9 m (16 ft); at just 3 m (10 ft), the pelagic thresher, Alopias pelagicus, is the smallest. Thresher sharks are fairly slender, with small dorsal fins and large, recurved pectoral fins. With the exception of the bigeye thresher, these sharks have relatively small eyes positioned to the forward of the head. Coloration ranges from brownish, bluish or purplish gray dorsally with lighter shades ventrally. The three species can be roughly distinguished by the primary color of the dorsal surface of the body. Common threshers are dark green, bigeye threshers are brown and pelagic threshers are generally blue. Lighting conditions and water clarity can affect how any one shark appears to an observer, but the color test is generally supported when other features are examined. Diet The thresher shark mainly feeds on pelagic schooling fish such as bluefish, juvenile tuna, and mackerel, which they are known to follow into shallow waters, squid and cuttlefish. Crustaceans and occasionally seabirds are also taken. The thresher shark stuns its prey using its elongated tail as a weapon. Behavior Thresher sharks are solitary creatures which keep to themselves. It is known that thresher populations of the Indian Ocean are separated by depth and space according to sex. Some species however do occasionally hunt in a group of two or three contrary to their solitary nature. All species are noted for their highly migratory or oceanodromous habits. When hunting schooling fish, thresher sharks are known to \\"whip\\" the water. The elongated tail is used to swat smaller fish, stunning them before feeding. Sometimes the thresher shark will slice the fish in half before eating.Oliver SP, Turner JR, Gann K, Silvosa M and D'Urban Jackson T (2013) \\"Thresher sharks use tail-slaps as a hunting strategy\\" PLoS ONE, 8 (7): e67380. Thresher sharks are one of the few shark species known to jump fully out of the water,using their elongated tail to propel them out of the water, making turns like dolphins; this behavior is called breaching. Endothermy Two species of the thresher have been identified as having a modified circulatory system that acts as a counter- current heat exchanger, which allows them to retain metabolic heat. Mackerel sharks (family Lamnidae) have a similar homologous structure to this which is more extensively developed. This structure is a strip of red muscle along each of its flanks, which has a tight network of blood vessels that transfer metabolic heat inward towards the core of the shark, allowing it to maintain and regulate its body heat. Reproduction No distinct breeding season is observed by thresher sharks. Fertilization and embryonic development occur internally; this ovoviviparous or live-bearing mode of reproduction results in a small litter (usually two to four) of large well-developed pups, up to 150 cm at birth in thintail threshers. The young fish exhaust their yolk sacs while still inside the mother, at which time they begin feasting on the mother's unfertilized eggs; this is known as oophagy. Thresher sharks are slow to mature; males reach sexual maturity between seven and 13 years of age and females between eight and 14 years in bigeye threshers. They may live for 20 years or more. In October 2013, the first picture of a thresher shark giving birth was taken off the coast of the Philippines. Fisheries Thresher sharks are classified as prized game fish in the United States and South Africa. Common thresher sharks are the target of a popular recreational fishery off Baja, Mexico. Status Because of their low fecundity, thresher sharks are highly vulnerable to overfishing. All three thresher shark species have been listed as vulnerable to extinction by the World Conservation Union since 2007 (IUCN).

Their lyrical emphasis on themes of romance, depression, and death resulted in the nickname \\"the Drab Four\\" (in homage to the Beatles' \\"Fab Four\\" moniker). The band went Platinum with 1993's Bloody Kisses, and Gold with 1996's October Rust, and gained a fanbase through seven studio albums, two best-of compilations, and concert DVDs. On April 14, 2010, Steele died, reportedly from heart failureTYPE O NEGATIVE Keyboardist Confirms PETER STEELE's Death ‚Äì Apr. 15, 2010 at blabbermouth.net brought on by an aortic aneurysm. Hickey and Kelly stated in a November 2010 interview with French music magazine Rock Hard that Type O Negative had broken up following Steele's death. (Interview with Kenny Hickey, Johnny Kelly and Matt Brown, November 27, 2010) History =Origins (1980s‚Äì1991)= Former Carnivore frontman Peter Steele, along with childhood friends Sal Abruscato, Josh Silver, and Kenny Hickey, formed Type O Negative and signed to Roadrunner Records. Shortly after signing in 1991 the band released their debut, Slow, Deep and Hard. =Slow, Deep and Hard and The Origin of the Feces (1991‚Äì1992)= Type O Negative's first album, Slow Deep and Hard, incorporated dragging Black Sabbath-esque dirge riffs, maniacal hardcore outbursts, and droning industrial and gothic atmospheres. The songs were long, multi-part theatrical epics, with lyrics loosely surrounding a story involving a man enacting revenge on a cheating girlfriend before ultimately contemplating his actions and committing suicide. They began creating a new album that was supposed to be live. The subsequent 1992 album was entitled The Origin of the Feces and a warning label was put on the album cover: \\"Not Live at Brighton Beach\\". The album contains faux-live recordings of songs from Slow, Deep and Hard, as well as previously unreleased songs such as \\"Are You Afraid\\" and \\"Hey Pete\\" (a cover of Jimi Hendrix's \\"Hey Joe\\" with altered lyrics) and Black Sabbath's \\"Paranoid\\". =Bloody Kisses and October Rust (1993‚Äì1998)= Type O Negative's third album, Bloody Kisses, was released in 1993 to critical and listener acclaim, and eventually became the first record for Roadrunner to reach certified Platinum status in the US. Bloody Kisses mostly addressed loneliness and heartbreak, with songs like \\"Too Late: Frozen\\", \\"Blood & Fire\\" and \\"Can't Lose You\\". The organ-driven \\"Set Me on Fire\\" is vintage 1960s garage rock, while \\"Summer Breeze\\" covered the 1972 Seals and Crofts hit. \\"Christian Woman\\" and \\"Black No. 1 (Little Miss Scare- All)\\" became the most popular tracks, after having been edited down to radio- friendly lengths (the album versions were 9 and 11 minutes long respectively). In order to promote the album, Type O Negative embarked on a two-year world tour. During this time, the band was featured on MTV, VH1, and in Rolling Stone. In the midst of this media blitz, drummer Sal Abruscato quit the band to join another Brooklyn quartet, Life of Agony. Johnny Kelly, the band's drum technician, was therefore hired as a full-fledged member. Bloody Kisses was re-released a year after the original release in a limited-edition Digipak form, including eight of the musical tracks from the original (omitting the \\"filler\\" tracks) and the previously unreleased \\"Suspended in Dusk\\". Type O's October Rust picked up where Bloody Kisses left off, exploring themes of sex, nature and sensuality, first in a humorous sense on the single \\"My Girlfriend's Girlfriend\\" and then taken much darker with \\"Love You to Death\\". This record also saw a cover of Neil Young's \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" as well as the fan favorite, semi-serene \\"Green Man\\". While not quite as successful as Bloody Kisses, the album was certified Gold in the US, and was the first Type O Negative album to enter the top half of the Billboard Top 200, debuting at No. 42. =World Coming Down and The Least Worst of Type O Negative (1999‚Äì2001)= With the completion of another successful world tour, writing for a fifth album began. In the period immediately following the release of October Rust, resulting in 1999's World Coming Down (working titles included Prophets of Doom and Aggroculture).World Coming Down debuted at No. 39 on the Billboard Top 200 charts. World Coming Down featured a much darker, bleak tone than its predecessors, having been written after a series of deaths in frontman Peter Steele's family. A best of album followed in 2000, entitled The Least Worst of Type O Negative. Although most songs appear on previous albums, many are unreleased remixes or B-sides of previously released singles. Along with these songs are some unreleased numbers from the World Coming Down sessions, the band's cover of \\"Black Sabbath\\" by Black Sabbath (Peter Steele's version with different lyrics, written from the perspective of Satan), and a cleaner version of \\"Hey Pete\\" (originally released on the mock live album The Origin of the Feces). =Life Is Killing Me and Dead Again (2002‚Äì2009)= Type O Negative's sixth studio album, Life Is Killing Me (originally called The Dream Is Dead after the closing song), was released in 2003. For this album, the band picked up the pace of their sound from the dirgeful slowness of World Coming Down. Songs such as \\"Todd's Ship Gods (Above All Things)\\", \\"(We Were) Electrocute\\", and \\"I Don't Wanna Be Me\\" convey the band's classic elements of melody, though the song lengths were much shorter on this outing, the longest being the 7 and a half-minute \\"How Could She?\\", a list of female character names from television shows. The album includes a humorous cover of the song \\"Angry Inch\\" from the musical Hedwig and the Angry Inch, detailing a sex change operation gone terribly wrong. Type O then left Roadrunner for SPV Records and released Dead Again in 2007. Dead Again debuted at No. 27 in the United States, the band's highest chart debut to date. They also continued to tour through October of that year, including a performance at the Rock am Ring festival in N√ºrburgring, Germany. =Peter Steele's death and the end of Type O Negative (2010)= On April 14, 2010, frontman and bassist Peter Steele died, reportedly from heart failure. The following statement concerning Steele was released April 15 on the band's official website: In a November 2010 interview with Rock Hard magazine, Johnny Kelly and Kenny Hickey confirmed that following Steele's death, Type O Negative had split-up. Roadrunner Records released a box set of all the band's albums (with the exception of Dead Again) for Back to Black Friday 2011, a spinoff of Record Store Day, on November 25, 2011. Each vinyl cover has no text and The Origin of the Feces uses its original cover art. The box set also contains various bumper stickers related to the band.  Influences  Steele cited Black Sabbath and the Beatles as main influences on Type O Negative. Other influences are Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Judas Priest, and AC/DC, and gothic rock/post-punk bands such as Joy Division, Cocteau Twins, Christian Death, Bauhaus, The Sisters of Mercy, Killing Joke, The Psychedelic Furs, Clan Of Xymox and Dead Can Dance. In a 1999 interview, Steele also cited Laibach, Devo and Depeche Mode as influences. In another interview, in 2003, he also expressed his appreciation for shoegaze acts like Lush and Curve and for the new romantic band A Flock Of Seagulls. Soundtracks and covers Type O Negative's songs have appeared in numerous motion pictures, including \\"Blood and Fire (Out of the Ashes Remix)\\" on the 1995 Mortal Kombat movie soundtrack (also on the bonus CD of Life is Killing Me), \\"Love You to Death\\" in Bride of Chucky, \\"Everyone I Love Is Dead\\" in Faust: Love Of The Damned, \\"(We Were) Electrocute\\" in Freddy vs. Jason, and \\"Summer Breeze\\" in I Know What You Did Last Summer. As a result of Howard Stern being a self-professed fan, Private Parts: The Album contains \\"Pictures of Matchstick Men\\" with the band playing music and Ozzy Osbourne on vocals. \\"Haunted\\" also appears on The Blair Witch Project \\"soundtrack CD\\" (the album's concept was to contain songs from \\"a tape that was found in the woods with the students' gear\\"). In 1998, Arrow Videos made their own version of the 1922 classic horror film Nosferatu, by simply overdubbing the silent film with a soundtrack consisting entirely of Type O Negative tracks, taken from the first four albums. This version is now on DVD from DigiView Entertainment, a company that makes budget-priced DVDs. It also has an introduction by actor David Carradine. In other media, the computer game Descent 2 features a shortened, instrumental version of the track \\"Haunted\\". Additionally, Descent 2: The Vertigo Series contains a full-length version of the instrumental; the compilation Duke Nukem: Music to Score By features \\"Cinnamon Girl (Extended Depression Mix)\\"; \\"Love You to Death\\" in the computer game Blood; \\"Out of the Fire\\" from the Life is Killing Me bonus CD was a theme created for wrestler Kane, but was never used. The opening two seconds of \\"I Don't Wanna Be Me\\" were used as a frequent sample in Grand Theft Auto IV, on the Liberty Rock Radio Station, and 2012 video game The Darkness II features Type O Negative's \\"Black No. 1\\" in its multiplayer lobby, played at random amongst other songs. Type O Negative performed and recorded numerous covers. The Doors' \\"Light My Fire\\" has been covered live numerous times, mostly during the 1990s. Steele has described the song as \\"probably the greatest song ever written\\" before apologizing for having \\"destroyed it\\". Seals and Crofts' \\"Summer Breeze\\" appears on Bloody Kisses, and Neil Young's \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" appears on October Rust. The tongue-in-cheek \\"Angry Inch\\" (from Hedwig and the Angry Inch) appears on Life is Killing Me. World Coming Down includes a Beatles medley consisting of \\"Day Tripper\\", \\"If I Needed Someone\\", and \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\". Other covers include a rendition of Black Sabbath's \\"Paranoid\\" and \\"N.I.B.\\"; Status Quo's \\"Pictures of Matchstick Men\\" with Ozzy Osbourne, two versions of \\"Black Sabbath\\" (one with the original lyrics and one rewritten by Peter Steele to be from Satan's perspective), Jimi Hendrix's \\"Hey Joe\\" (rewritten as \\"Hey Pete\\"); the Beatles' \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\", Deep Purple's \\"Highway Star\\" and Creedence Clearwater Revival's \\"Bad Moon Rising\\". A medley of Santana's \\"Evil Ways\\", \\"Oye Como Va\\", and \\"Black Magic Woman\\" are also available on the CD accompanying the DVD Symphony for the Devil.

She was commissioned in 1930, originally classified a light cruiser because of her thin armor but later reclassified a heavy cruiser because of her 8-inch guns. During World War II she served in the Pacific and was sunk by Japanese torpedoes during the Battle of Tassafaronga on 30 November 1942. She was named after the city of Northampton, Massachusetts, the home of former President Calvin Coolidge.  Construction  Northampton was laid down on 12 April 1928, by Bethlehem Steel Corp.'s Fore River Shipyard, Quincy, Massachusetts; launched on 5 September 1929; sponsored by Grace Coolidge (wife of the former President); and commissioned on 17 May 1930, Captain (later Vice Admiral) Walter N. Vernou in command.  Inter-war period  Northampton in 1930. Joining the Atlantic Fleet, Northampton made a shakedown cruise to the Mediterranean during the summer of 1930, then participated in the fleet training schedule which took her to the Caribbean, the Panama Canal Zone, and, occasionally, into the Pacific for exercises with other cruisers and ships of all types. Redesignated CA-26 in 1931 in accordance with the London Naval Treaty, she operated primarily in the Pacific from 1932, homeported at San Pedro, and later at Pearl Harbor. Northampton was one of six ships to receive the new RCA CXAM radar in 1940.  World War II  USS Northampton of the Enterprise task force enters Pearl on 8 December 1941. Northampton was at sea with Admiral William Halsey, Jr. in task force during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, returning to port the next day. On 9 December, the force sortied to search northeast of Oahu, then swept south to Johnston Island, then north again to hunt the enemy west of Lisianski Island and Midway Atoll. On 11 December, was damaged when it collided with Northampton during underway refueling. Through January 1942, Northampton joined in such searches until detached with to bombard Wotje on 1 February. The bombardment not only demolished buildings and fuel dumps on the island, but also sank two Japanese ships. A similar assault was fired against Wake Island on 24 February when, despite serious enemy counterfire, the guns of Northampton and her force started large fires on the island and sank a dredge in the lagoon. As Northampton retired from the island, enemy seaplanes, landbased planes, and patrol craft attacked, but all were destroyed or repulsed. On 4 March, the force launched aircraft for a strike on Marcus Island, then turned east for Pearl Harbor. Early in April, Enterprises task force, including Northampton, sortied once again, and joined force for the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo 18 April. Once again the ships replenished at Pearl Harbor, then sailed for the Southwest Pacific, arriving just after the battle of the Coral Sea. Returning to Pearl Harbor, Northampton prepared for the action soon to come at the battle of Midway, when she screened Enterprise. On 4‚Äì5 June, the American carriers launched their planes to win a great victory, turning the Japanese back in mid-Pacific, and dealing them a tremendous blow by sinking four carriers. Throughout the Battle of Midway, Northampton protected her carrier and with her returned undamaged to Pearl Harbor on 13 June. In mid-August, Northampton sailed for the Southwest Pacific to join in the Guadalcanal operation. She patrolled southeast of San Cristobal, where on 15 September her force was attacked by submarines, which sank and damaged , and another torpedo hit badly damaged only off Northamptons port beam. Now sailing with Hornet, Northampton screened the carrier during attacks on Bougainville Island on 5 October. During the battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October, which took place without surface contact with the enemy, Northampton went to the aid of Hornet, mortally wounded by enemy aircraft, and provided antiaircraft cover while attempting to take the stricken carrier in tow. Obviously doomed, the carrier was later sunk by destroyer torpedo and gunfire, and the American force retired to the southwest. = Loss at the Battle of Tassafaronga = Northampton attempting to tow Hornet during the battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October 1942 Northampton next operated with a cruiser-destroyer force, to prevent the Japanese from reinforcing their troops on Guadalcanal. The Battle of Tassafaronga began 40 minutes before midnight on 30 November, when three American destroyers made a surprise torpedo attack on the Japanese. All American ships then opened fire, which the startled enemy did not return for seven minutes. Two of the American cruisers took torpedo hits within the space of a minute, and 10 minutes later, another was hit, all being forced to retire from the action. Northampton and , with six destroyers, continued the fierce action. Close to the end of the engagement, Northampton was struck by two torpedoes, which tore a huge hole in her port side, ripping away decks and bulkheads. Flaming oil sprayed over the ship; she took on water rapidly and began to list. Three hours later, as she began to sink stern-first, she had to be abandoned. So orderly and controlled was the process that loss of life was surprisingly light. Most of the survivors were picked up within an hour by destroyers of Task Force 67. About 40 crewmen spent the rest of the night in two life rafts. Those survivors were later rescued by torpedo boat PT 109 and landed on Tulagi Island. U. S. Navy archives contain a photo of PT 109 entering the anchorage at Tulagi, her topside crowded by Northampton survivors, some of them seriously wounded or dying. Five months after this battle PT 109 got a new skipper: Lt.jg John F. Kennedy. It was a tactical defeat, as three cruisers had been severely damaged and Northampton lost in exchange for the loss of only one Japanese destroyer; nevertheless the Japanese had been denied a major reinforcement. The senior officer killed on Northampton during the battle of Tassafaronga was Chief Engineer, Commander (select) Hilan Ebert of Alliance, Ohio. Ebert was awarded the Navy Cross. In honor of Commander Ebert, the destroyer escort was launched 11 May 1944 by Tampa Shipbuilding Co., Inc., Tampa, Florida; sponsored by the widow of Commander Ebert; Mrs. Hilan Ebert. Commanding officer of the ship, Captain Willard A. Kitts survived the sinking and was also decorated the Navy Cross for handling the evacuation of Northampton. rescued survivors of Northampton, ingeniously using cork-floated cargo nets to take great groups of them from the water.  Awards  Northampton received six battle stars for World War II service.  In fiction  Northampton plays a prominent role in Herman Wouk's novel War and Remembrance as Victor Henry's first seagoing command in many years. The ship's operations in the book are identical to those in its real life. The novel includes a discussion of the design compromises imposed on the Northampton-class by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. The ship also figured prominently in the War and Remembrance (miniseries). Northampton was also used as a reference in the 1937 film Navy Blue and Gold, in which James Stewart played a seaman who was stationed on Northampton before being awarded an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis. Stewart's character mentioned that he played football for Northampton, and that it was the fleet football champion.

The larger of the two is Skellig Michael (also known as Great Skellig) which, together with Little Skellig, is at the centre of a Important Bird Area established by BirdWatch Ireland in 2000. Skellig Michael is also famous for an early Christian monastery that is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Little Skellig The smaller of the two islands is Little Skellig (Sceilig Bheag in Irish).logainm.ie () It is Ireland's largest northern gannet (Morus bassanus) colony with almost 30,000 pairs, and is closed to the public. It is also one of the world's largest, and is of international importance. The island is tall and is approximately east- northeast of Skellig Michael. Skellig Michael Also known as Great Skellig (Sceilig Mhich√≠l in Irishlogainm.ie), this is the larger of the two islands, with two peaks rising to over above sea level. With a sixth-century Christian monastery perched at above sea level on a ledge close to the top of the lower peak, Great Skellig is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Birdwatch Ireland were concerned that the Irish government allowed filming on a seabird sanctuary without third party consent. During the 2014 nesting season, black- legged kittiwake chicks in nests were swept into the sea by the downdraught from a helicopter and devoured by gulls.Star Wars: Habitats directive ‚Äòbreached‚Äô on Skellig Michael, The Irish Times, 17 December 2015 Wildlife Both of the Skellig islands are known for their seabird colonies, and together comprise one of the most important seabird sites in Ireland, both for the population size and for the species diversity. Among the breeding birds are European storm petrel (Hydrobates pelagicus), northern gannet, northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), common guillemot (Uria aalge), razorbill (Alca torda) and Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) (with 4,000 or more puffins on Great Skellig alone). Red-billed chough (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) can also be seen. The surrounding waters have abundant wildlife with many Grey seal (Halichoerus grypus). Basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus), minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), dolphin (Delphinidae), beaked whale, and leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) have also been recorded. The islands have many interesting recreational diving sites due to the clear water, an abundance of life, and underwater cliffs down to 60 meters (200 feet). Filming location The final scene of Star Wars: The Force Awakens was shot on Skellig in July 2015, with additional filming taking place there in September 2015 for the following film in the series, Star Wars: The Last Jedi. The remains of the Skellig Michael monastery appear in the film, representing an ancient Jedi temple. Earlier, the Skellig Islands served as a location in the Werner Herzog 1976 movie Heart of Glass, where the islands feature in one of the prophecies by the seer Hias. Certain scenes from the 2012 movie Byzantium were also filmed here.

Malcolm (born February 2, 1947) is an activist with a long career in American politics, particularly in political fundraising. She founded EMILY's List in 1985 and served as its president until 2010. Her great-grandfather is A. Ward Ford, an IBM founder.  Early life  Malcolm grew up in Montclair, New Jersey, the daughter of parents who met while working in the sales department at IBM.Spake, Amanda. \\"Women Can Be Power Brokers, Too\\", The Washington Post, June 5, 1988. Accessed December 3, 2017. \\"When Ellen Malcolm was growing up, she did not have a sense that she was richer than her friends in Montclair, N.J., an upper-middle-class suburb of New York City.... Malcolm's parents met while they both worked at IBM. Her father, William Reighley, was a salesman, and her mother, Barbara, was 'the assistant service gal' with the sales department.\\" After her father died when she was 8 months old, she became the heir to an IBM fortune, which she was to inherit at age 21. Malcolm attended Montclair Kimberley Academy, graduating in the class of 1965. Upon entering Hollins College, an all women‚Äôs school, in 1965 Malcolm says she was \\"apolitical\\" and didn't even realize the country was at war. She went to work for the campaign of Eugene McCarthy in 1968. McCarthy was a democratic and anti-war senator for the state of Minnesota. After he won the popular vote in the Democratic presidential primary, Malcolm was eager to become more involved in politics. Malcolm cites the Vietnam War, the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the riots that followed, the assassination of Robert Kennedy and the counterculture of the 60's as the factors that led to her political awakening. Though both of her parents, and much of her community was Republican, Malcolm says the turmoil of the time was shocking, and she felt compelled to help make a change. In the summer of 1968 she began volunteering at the Manpower Development Program in Newark. After graduating from Hollins College in 1969, she worked for Common Cause in the 1970s.  Political activism  Malcolm began working for Common Cause in the very early stages of the organization. She was charged with overseeing a number of volunteers who were putting pressure on representatives to end the Vietnam War. Malcolm credits her time at Common Cause with teaching her the \\"nuts and bolts\\" of campaigning. Malcolm became the press secretary of the National Women's Political Caucus after leaving Common Cause. Through her work at the NWPC, she came to know Lael Stegall, the development director for the organization. Stegall expressed her interest to advise wealthy philanthropic women on where to direct their money. Malcolm, inheriting her fortune at age 21, was just such a woman. Malcolm's interest in giving money to worthy non- profits conflicted with her desire to advance her career based on her own merit, rather than her deep pockets. With Stegall as the executive director, together they started the Windom Fund in 1980. After leaving the NWPC in 1979, Malcolm found work as the press secretary for Esther Peterson, who was then the special assistant for consumer affairs for the Carter administration. Malcolm cites both Peterson and Millie Jeffries, the head of the NWPC, as major influences on her political beliefs. In 1982, Malcolm became involved with the campaign of Harriet Woods, a Democratic woman running for a spot in the US Senate. Woods lost the seat due to running out of funds a few weeks before the election, causing her television ads to lose air time. Because of her involvement in the campaign, Malcolm discovered that not a single woman had been elected to the US Senate, instead they had all been appointed. Malcolm identified the main cause of this to be insufficient funds for women's campaigns. In 1983, Malcolm hosted a breakfast for a small number of women that she knew were interested in political activism. Together, they identified a clear goal: use early funds or seed money to elect a woman to the US Senate. This was the beginning of EMILY's List (Early Money Is Like Yeast), which Malcolm founded in 1985. EMILY's list effectively set up a donor network composed mostly of women who, in exchange for their money, got information about whom to vote for from people they knew had similar interests to themselves. These interests were clear: elect pro-choice democratic women to public office. In 2007, she served as co-chair of Hillary Clinton's election campaign, and in 2010 she was appointed to the National Park Foundation Board of Directors. Malcolm served as president of America Coming Together from 2003-04. Currently, Malcolm serves on the board of EMILY's list, the National Partnership for Women and Families, and the National Park Foundation.  Books  Malcolm, along with Craig Unger, wrote When Women Win: EMILY's List and the Rise of Women in American Politics, published in 2016.  Accolades  She was named one of the Women of the Year by Glamour (1992), one of America's most influential women by Vanity Fair (1998), one of the 100 Most Important Women in America by Ladies' Home Journal (1999), one of Time magazine‚Äôs 50 Women Who Made American Political History (2017), and Most Valuable Player by the American Association of Political Consultants, and given the Margaret Sanger Award by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

Petty officer third class shares the same pay grade as senior airman in the Air Force, which no longer has an NCO rank corresponding with E-4. History Unlike seaman and lower ranks, a sailor's advancement to petty officer third class is not automatic given time in service, but is also contingent on performance evaluations by their superiors and rate examinations (tests of specialty knowledge), except for certain technical ratings which carry automatic advancement to PO3 after successful completion of that rating's \\"A\\" school and fulfillment of time in rate requirements. The advancement cycle is currently every six months. Only a certain number of billets (job openings for a given rank) open up biannually and all seamen compete for promotion. The top scorers are chosen for advancement, but only in sufficient numbers to fill the billets available. Petty officers serve a dual role as both technical experts and as leaders. Unlike the sailors who rank below them, there is no such thing as an undesignated petty officer. Every petty officer has both a rank and rating (job, similar to an MOS or AFSC in other branches). The rank and rating combined are known collectively as a sailor's rate. A petty officer's full title is a combination of the two. Thus, a petty officer third class who has the rating of Aviation Structural Mechanic is called an Aviation Structural Mechanic Third Class. The term petty officer is only used in abstract, the general sense, when referring to a group of petty officers of different ratings, or when the petty officer's rating is unknown. Each rating has an official abbreviation, such as AM for aviation structural mechanic. When combined with the petty officer level, this gives the shorthand for the petty officer's rank, such as AM3 for aviation structural mechanic third class. It is common practice to refer to the petty officer by this shorthand in all but the most formal correspondence, such as printing an inscription on awards. Often the petty officer is referred to by the shorthand designation, without using the surname. Thus AM3 Anderson would be called AM3. To address a petty officer, one would say, \\"Petty Officer Smith\\", \\"Smith\\", or \\"sailor\\", the latter two forms being acceptable for use by those equal or greater in rank than the petty officer. It is uncommon to address a petty officer as simply \\"petty officer\\" the way one might address an NCO in the Army as \\"sergeant\\". It is also acceptable, though archaic, to address a petty officer or chief petty officer of any grade as \\"Mister Smith\\" or \\"Miss Smith\\". In the modern navy, however, the use of \\"miss\\" or \\"mister\\" is common only in reference to junior commissioned officers or warrant officers. The rate insignia for a petty officer third class is a white perched eagle and one specialty mark (rating) above a chevron. On dress uniforms the symbol for the petty officer's rating is placed between the two. On the dress white uniform, the eagle, rating, and chevron are navy blue. This has led to the eagle, and even the entire rating badge, being commonly referred to as \\"the crow\\". On the dress blue uniform, the eagle and rating are white, and the chevron is red. The insignia worn on working uniforms, such as coveralls and the naval working uniform, and metal rank devices, like those worn on the collar of the naval service uniform, have the rating symbol omitted. When a sailor is promoted to petty officer third class, it is traditional for sailors already holding that or a higher enlisted rank to \\"tack on the crow\\". Originally this custom involved a recently promoted sailor's fellow petty officers taking turns stitching the new rank insignia on the sailor's uniform, the rushed needlework referred to as \\"tacking\\". More recently the custom has taken on a different form, being done with a gesture ranging from a light tap to a hard punch over the new petty officer's sleeve insignia. This, however, has lately been deemed \\"hazing\\", and as such individuals involved in this practice can be subject to disciplinary action. This disciplinary action often includes the individual being demoted. The \\"tacking on of the crow\\" has also been known to cause serious injury. It is not just patches that are \\"tacked on\\", but also metal insignia in the chest area that have sharp attachment pins, such as the insignia for surface warfare or submarine service. A hard enough punch can cause the attachment points to pierce a sailor's skin. Commanding officers are also known to direct the ship corpsman to perform physical exams for possible abuse and to report all injuries to newly promoted personnel, so punishment cannot be avoided. High year tenure The U.S. Navy's high year tenure policy has made the good conduct variation for a petty officer third class all but obsolete. Among enlisted sailors 12 consecutive years of good conduct (categorized as no court-martial convictions or non-judicial punishments) entitles the sailor to wear a good conduct variation of their rank insignia, with the normally red chevrons under the specialty mark and perched eagle worn as gold and the eagle itself worn as silver. However, the high year tenure initiative mandates that a petty officer third class may only have ten years of service. If a PO3 fails to make petty officer second class within those ten years, the petty officer is involuntarily separated for not meeting advancement requirements. This same restriction has been imposed upon the ranks of petty officer second class and first class, allowing 16 years of service to a PO2 before advancement must be attained, and 22 years of service to a petty officer first class. All of these initiatives, however, may be waived in the event the sailor holds critical training qualifications, Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) job codes, or special clearances. Today the few instances in which a PO3 has gold chevrons are usually instances in which a sailor has previous military service. The single gold chevron is extremely rare, but can still be found in Navy uniform shops. All U.S. Coast Guard petty officers wear red chevrons and red service stripes until the rank of chief petty officer, who wear gold chevrons and service stripes. Royal Navy In the British Royal Navy and the navies of many other Commonwealth nations, the equivalent rank is \\"able seaman\\", although this rank is considered junior to the nearest equivalent ranks of corporal or bombardier in the other military branches.

Description Bores occur in relatively few locations worldwide, usually in areas with a large tidal range (typically more than between high and low tide) and where incoming tides are funneled into a shallow, narrowing river or lake via a broad bay. The funnel-like shape not only increases the tidal range, but it can also decrease the duration of the flood tide, down to a point where the flood appears as a sudden increase in the water level. A tidal bore takes place during the flood tide and never during the ebb tide. Undular bore and whelps near the mouth of Araguari River in northeastern Brazil. The view is oblique towards the mouth from airplane at approximately altitude.Figure 5 in: A tidal bore may take on various forms, ranging from a single breaking wavefront with a roller ‚Äì somewhat like a hydraulic jump ‚Äì to undular bores, comprising a smooth wavefront followed by a train of secondary waves known as whelps. Large bores can be particularly unsafe for shipping but also present opportunities for river surfing. Two key features of a tidal bore are the intense turbulence and turbulent mixing generated during the bore propagation, as well as its rumbling noise. The visual observations of tidal bores highlight the turbulent nature of the surging waters. The tidal bore induces a strong turbulent mixing in the estuarine zone, and the effects may be felt along considerable distances. The velocity observations indicate a rapid deceleration of the flow associated with the passage of the bore as well as large velocity fluctuations. A tidal bore creates a powerful roar that combines the sounds caused by the turbulence in the bore front and whelps, entrained air bubbles in the bore roller, sediment erosion beneath the bore front and of the banks, scouring of shoals and bars, and impacts on obstacles. The bore rumble is heard far away because its low frequencies can travel over long distances. The low-frequency sound is a characteristic feature of the advancing roller in which the air bubbles entrapped in the large-scale eddies are acoustically active and play the dominant role in the rumble-sound generation. Etymology The word bore derives through Old English from the Old Norse word b√°ra, meaning \\"wave\\" or \\"swell.\\" Effects Tidal bores can be dangerous. Certain rivers such as the Seine in France, the Petitcodiac River in Canada, and the Colorado River in Mexico to name a few, have had a sinister reputation in association with tidal bores. In China, despite warning signs erected along the banks of the Qiantang River, a number of fatalities occur each year by people who take too much risk with the bore. The tidal bores affect the shipping and navigation in the estuarine zone, for example, in Papua New Guinea (Fly and Bamu Rivers), Malaysia (Benak at Batang Lupar), and India (Hoogly bore). On the other hand, tidal bore-affected estuaries are rich feeding zones and breeding grounds of several forms of wildlife. The estuarine zones are the spawning and breeding grounds of several native fish species, while the aeration induced by the tidal bore contributes to the abundant growth of many species of fish and shrimps (for example in the Rokan River). The tidal bores also provide opportunity for recreational inland surfing. =Scientific studies= Scientific studies have been carried out at the River Dee in Wales in the United Kingdom, the Garonne and S√©lune in France, the Daly River in Australia, and the Qiantang River estuary in China. The force of the tidal bore flow often poses a challenge to scientific measurements, as evidenced by a number of field work incidents in the River Dee, Rio Mearim, Daly River, and S√©lune River. Rivers and bays with tidal bores Rivers and bays that have been known to exhibit bores include those listed below. =Asia= * Ganges‚ÄìBrahmaputra, India and Bangladesh * Indus River, Pakistan * Sittaung River, Burma * Qiantang River, China, which has the world's largest bore, up to high, traveling at up to * Batang Lupar or Lupar River, near Sri Aman, Malaysia.

Launched in 1932, she completed a number of training and goodwill cruises in the interwar period before seeing extensive service during World War II, beginning with the Battle of the Coral Sea in 1942, where she escorted the aircraft carrier and picked up survivors from the sunken carrier . She screened for Yorktown again in the Battle of Midway, picking up her survivors as well. She then supported the carrier during the initial phase of the Guadalcanal Campaign later that year, and was torpedoed during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. The torpedo inflicted heavy damage which put her out of action for six months as she was repaired in Sydney, Australia, and later San Diego, California. Returning to combat in mid-1943, Portland saw action in many of the major engagements of the Pacific War, conducting shore bombardments in support of campaigns at the Aleutian Islands, Gilbert and Marshall Islands, Mariana Islands, and New Guinea. She was involved in the October 1944 Battle of Leyte Gulf, engaging Japanese ships in the decisive Battle of Surigao Strait. She then conducted shore bombardments at Lingayen Gulf and Corregidor Island, and in 1945 supported landings during the Battle of Okinawa until the end of the war. Following World War II, Portland accepted the Japanese surrender in the Caroline Islands and then undertook several Operation Magic Carpet cruises to bring U.S. troops home. She was decommissioned in 1946 and scrapped by 1962. In her extensive service she accrued 16 battle stars, making her one of the most decorated ships in the U.S. fleet.  Design and construction  Portland was the lead ship of the third class of \\"treaty cruisers\\" to be constructed by the United States Navy following the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, following the two vessels of the ordered in 1926 and the six vessels of the ordered in 1927. Ordered for the U.S. Navy in Fiscal Year 1930. Portland was originally designated as a light cruiser, because of her thin armor, and given the hull classification symbol CL-33. She was reclassified a heavy cruiser, because of her 8-inch guns, with the symbol CA-33 on 1 July 1931, in accordance with the London Naval Treaty. Portland was designed for a standard displacement of , and a full-load displacement of . However, Portland only displaced when completed. In 1943, a light tripod was added forward of the second funnel on the ship, and a prominent fire-control director was installed aft. Her four Parsons GT geared turbines each drove a propeller shaft using steam provided by eight Yarrow boilers. Portlands power plant generated and she had a designed maximum speed of . The ship reached, however, on sea trials. She rolled badly until fitted with bilge keels. Portland was designed for a range of at . The ship was armed with a main battery of nine Mark 9 8\\"/55 caliber guns arrayed in three triple mounts, a superfiring pair forward and one aft. She was armed with eight 5\\"/25 caliber guns for anti-aircraft defense, and she also had two QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss saluting guns. In 1945, her anti-aircraft defenses were upgraded, receiving 24 Bofors 40 mm guns which were arranged in four quad mounts and four twin mounts. Portland was also upgraded with seventeen Oerlikon 20 mm cannons. She was originally designed with of armor for deck and side protection, but during construction her armor was increased. As completed, the ship was protected with of belt armor which increased to around the magazines. Her armor was between and thick on the transverse bulkheads, while armor on her main deck was thick. Armor on her barbettes was thick, armor on her gunhouses was thick, and armor on her conning tower was thick. Additionally, the Portland-class cruisers were designed with space to be outfitted as fleet flagships, with accommodations for an Admiral and his staff to operate. The class also featured two aircraft catapult amidships, and she could carry four aircraft which were stored in a hangar. Her total crew complement varied, with a regular designed crew complement of 848, a wartime complement of 952, and a complement 1,229 when the cruiser was operating as a fleet flagship. Portland was laid down by Bethlehem Steel at its Quincy Shipyard on 17 February 1930. The machinery was provided by the builders. Portland was launched on 21 May 1932 and commissioned on 23 February 1933. She was the first ship named for the city of Portland, Maine, and sponsored by the daughter of Mayor Ralph D. Brooks of Portland, and with Captain Herbert F. Leary as her first commander. Her sailors would later nickname her \\"Sweet Pea.\\"  Service history  St. John's Bridge, Portland, Oregon, in the 1930s Departing Boston on 1 April 1933, the cruiser arrived Gravesend Bay, New York late in the day on 3 April. The next evening, she was dispatched on her first assignment to the scene of the airship , which had crashed at sea. Thirty six minutes after receiving the message, she was underway and en route to the crash site. She was the first Navy vessel on scene, and began coordinating the search and rescue effort with other ships arriving. In spite of her efforts, 73 were killed in the crash, including Admiral William Moffett, Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics. Portland steamed from San Diego, California, on 2 October 1935 along with , which was carrying President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The president spent much of his trip fishing with his party. After visiting Panama and several other ports, the two ships steamed to Charleston, South Carolina, where the President disembarked. Portland spent the remainder of the interwar era with the Scouting Force, Cruiser Division 5 and later in the United States Pacific Fleet conducting peacetime training and a number of goodwill missions. She crossed the equator for the first time on 20 May 1936 during fleet maneuvers. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, Portland was two days away, en route to Midway Atoll as part of a carrier group escorting aircraft carrier . From December 1941 to 1 May 1942, she operated between the West Coast, Hawaii, and Fiji on patrol. = Battle of Coral Sea = Portland joined Task Force 17 (TF 17), commanded by Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher and centered around the carrier escorted by Portland as well as cruisers and plus the destroyers , , , , , and and oiler and Tippecanoe. TF 17 departed Tongatabu on 27 April en route to the Coral Sea. On the morning of 1 May, TF 17 joined with Task Force 11 (TF 11) about northwest of New Caledonia. TF 17 completed refueling the next day, but TF 11 reported that they would not be finished fueling until 4 May. Fletcher elected to take TF 17 northwest towards the Louisiades. At 17:00 on 3 May, Fletcher was notified that a force of Japanese troops had been sighted at Tulagi the day before, approaching the southern Solomons. TF 17 changed course and proceeded at towards Guadalcanal to launch airstrikes against the Japanese forces at Tulagi the next morning. On 4 May, from a position south of Guadalcanal (), TF 17 launched airstrikes against Japanese forces off Tulagi. After recovering its aircraft late in the evening of 4 May, TF17 retired towards the south. The next morning, TF 17 rendezvoused with TF 11 and Task Force 44 (TF 44) at a predetermined point south of Guadalcanal (). Prompted by reports the Japanese would attack Port Moresby, the force moved to the Louisiades to engage the Japanese the next day. Portland was assigned to Task Group 17.2 under Rear Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid together with cruisers , , Astoria, Chester, and five destroyers from Destroyer Squadron One. She screened for Yorktown throughout the operation, including during Japanese air attacks on the two carriers on 8 May. Following the battle, she was to escort the damaged Lexington, but after fires on that carrier became uncontrollable she was abandoned and sunk. Portland took on 722 of her survivors. She suffered no casualties herself, though at least four of her sailors were transferred to the Neosho shortly before the battle and were lost when that ship was sunk. = Battle of Midway = Portland, right, transfers survivors of to , left, on 7 June 1942, following the Battle of Midway. After brief repairs at Tongatabu, Portland took on a new commander, Captain Laurance T. DuBose. She then steamed for Pearl Harbor escorting Yorktown, before heading to Midway Atoll to set a trap for Japanese forces attacking there. On 4 June, after Dive-Bombers from carriers Yorktown and had sunk three Japanese carriers, aircraft from Japanese carrier Hiry≈´ responded with an attack on Yorktown that afternoon. Portland was to her port, providing anti-aircraft defense along with cruisers and . A Japanese air attack came at 14:00 and another after 16:30, and Yorktown was struck several times with torpedoes. With increasing damage, the carrier was abandoned and its survivors picked up by five destroyers and then transferred to Portland. In all, 2,046 of Yorktown's crew transferred to the cruiser. She then steamed toward Pearl Harbor and met the submarine tender and transferred the Yorktown survivors aboard her on 6 June. During 7 June she searched for downed naval aviators and the next day joined the group of carrier . They steamed for the Aleutian Islands to counter a Japanese force there but were recalled to Pearl Harbor two days later. View of the damaged stern of the USS Portland (CA-33) after the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on 13 November 1942. = Guadalcanal campaign = Portland accompanied the invasion fleet to Guadalcanal, escorting Enterprise. She remained off the coast protecting the landings at Tulagi and Guadalcanal from 7‚Äì9 August. In this duty, she missed the Battle of Savo Island and withdrew two days later following Enterprise. She then remained in the area to support the Guadalcanal operations and to protect communications lines for the attacking forces. Sutherland dry dock in Sydney, Australia, in December, 1942, to repair damage suffered during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. Remaining with Enterprise, she later participated in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons. On 24 August she was posted to air defense to the port of Enterprise, and though she and her sisters were able to down a number of Japanese aircraft, the carrier was hit at 18:34. She continued to protect the carrier through 25 August, when Allied forces prevented reinforcement of Japanese units in the Solomons by a large naval armada under Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. Following the battle she escorted Enterprise to Pearl Harbor and was then ordered on a secret mission to the Gilbert Islands to conduct a raid on Tarawa with light cruiser . She took aboard Rear Admiral Mahlon S. Tisdale and was designated Task Unit 16.9.1. Between 14:10 and 14:51 on 15 October she attacked Japanese ships near the island, damaging a transport and a destroyer and suffering one damaged aircraft before she withdrew and rejoined the Enterprise task group near the Solomons. She then steamed south to take part in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands as one of the escorts for Enterprise. The carrier came under heavy air attack at 10:12 on 24 October, and Portland suffered her first wartime damage as one of her guns exploded in firing and again when one of her AA guns depressed too low and damaged the splinter shield, injuring 19 officers and enlisted men. In heavy fighting Enterprise was hit once but Portland and the task group shot down several aircraft. At 11:53 the bridge lost control of steering, and before it could regain control, a Japanese submarine was spotted. The submarine struck Portland with three torpedoes, but none detonated, likely because the submarine had fired too close and they had no time to arm. Two weeks later, she participated in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal from 12‚Äì15 November, which resulted in heavy damage to both forces but broke up the determined Japanese effort to disrupt the landing of 6,000 American troops on Guadalcanal, to bombard Henderson Field, and to land 7,000 reinforcements of their own. At the outbreak of the battle, Portland was escorting a convoy traveling to Guadalcanal from New Caledonia as part of Task Force 67. After a four-day journey they arrived and began to offload supplies on 12 November and were countered by a Japanese air attack of 46 aircraft. That night, she was among a force of five cruisers and eight destroyers under Daniel J. Callaghan which steamed to counter an approaching Japanese force. They spotted a Japanese force of two battleships, one cruiser and eleven destroyers and immediately opened fire, sinking the . Shortly thereafter, Portland was struck by a torpedo fired by either the destroyer or the destroyer at 01:58, causing heavy damage to her stern. The torpedo struck the starboard side, which blew off both inboard propellers, jammed the rudder five degrees to starboard, and jammed her Number Three turret in train and elevation. A four degree list was quickly corrected by shifting ballast, but the steering problem could not be overcome and the ship was forced to steam in circles to starboard. The blast disrupted her steering column, forcing her to steer in a circle. At the end of her first circle, she fired on the battleship , with her forward turrets. The Japanese ship returned fire, but all salvos passed over the cruiser. In the four six-gun salvos returned by Portland, she succeeded in starting fires in the Japanese ship. At dawn, she was one of three U.S. ships still too damaged to withdraw on her own power. Then again at 06:30, still circling, Portland opened fire on the abandoned hulk of the destroyer at a range of . After the sixth salvo, Y≈´dachi exploded, rolled over, and sank within five minutes. She was eventually able to correct the steering problem and withdraw on her own power. She later received a Navy Unit Commendation for her actions in the battle. She suffered 18 killed, 17 wounded in the battle. With the assistance of Higgins boats, a YP, and a tug, Portland anchored at Tulagi on 14 November. From there, she was towed to Sydney, Australia, by the tugboat and escorted by the destroyers and for preliminary repairs prior to overhaul in the United States. She arrived at Sydney 30 November but did not enter drydock until 24 December after Chester and New Orleans were repaired. During this time the crew was given extended shore leave. Two of the ship's sailors died in accidents during this leave. She left Australia after preliminary repairs, escorted by destroyer . Following short stops at Samoa and Pearl Harbor, the ship arrived at Mare Island Navy Yard on 3 March 1943. =1943‚Äì1944= Portland wearing Camouflage Measure 32, Design 7D in 1944. After operational training in southern Californian waters, Portland steamed for the Aleutians late in May, arriving on 11 June and bombarding Kiska on 26 July. After covering a reconnaissance landing on Little Kiska on 17 August, she called at Pearl Harbor on 23 September, there to San Francisco in early October, then back to Pearl Harbor in mid-October. From November 1943 to February 1944, Portland participated in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaigns. She bombarded Tarawa on 20 November supporting landings there for several days. She was lightly damaged by a friendly depth charge when a nearby destroyer erroneously detected a Japanese submarine. In December 1943 she moved to the Marshall Islands escorting the new Essex-class carrier . While Lexington came under air attack, none of the Japanese planes came within range of Portland and she did not open fire. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 25 December, and went into drydock to repair her rudder and propellers. After repairs, she joined Task Group 51 under Rear Admiral Harry W. Hill for an attack on Darrit, steaming for that island on 23 January and arriving 30 January. After shelling the island for 30 minutes, it was discovered no Japanese were ashore. She then moved to support operations on Eniwetok Atoll on 8 February, providing shore bombardment on Parry Island ahead of landings which took place on 19 February. She then screened carriers conducting airstrikes at Palau, Yap, Ulithi, and Woleai between 30 March and 1 April. She then joined with a carrier force assigned to cover the landings around Hollandia and Tanahmerah on New Guinea, which took place from 21‚Äì24 April. She steamed northward with the carrier force and struck Truk with five other cruisers and destroyers. Portland then bombarded Satawan in the Nomei Group. Following this series of operations, Portland returned to Mare Island for a more extensive overhaul, which was completed in August. She returned to the western Pacific for shore bombardments of Peleliu from 12‚Äì14 September. The cruiser supported the landing on Peleliu on 15 September, providing artillery to support the advance of Allied forces. She provided gunfire support at Peleliu through 29 September, and then steamed for Seeadler Harbor, Manus Island in the Admiralties. =Battle of Leyte Gulf = Portland next joined Cruiser Division 4 for the next major campaign against the Philippines. She arrived off Leyte on 17 October, entering the Gulf the next day, and began two days of shore bombardments to prepare for the troop landings there. On the night of 24 October, a strong Japanese force consisting of two battleships, one heavy cruiser, and four destroyers headed for Surigao Strait with the apparent intent of raiding shipping in Leyte Gulf. The Japanese force advanced in rough column up the narrow strait during darkness, but was met with a large U.S. force of cruisers, destroyers and battleships, including Portland. She and her sisters steamed across the top of the strait, crossing the T of the Japanese force. The Japanese were first met by PT boats, then in succession by three coordinated destroyer torpedo attacks, and finally by devastating gunfire from American battleships and cruisers disposed across the northern end of the strait. Portland took the under fire, scoring four hits on her at 04:02, striking the compass platform and AA defense center. She continued firing on the Mogami for ten minutes She continued to fire on the stranded Mogami until 05:30, striking several hits, including on the ship's bridge. The Battle of Surigao Strait was a decisive defeat for the Japanese force, with most of its ships being destroyed. =1945= leading , , Portland, and into Lingayen Gulf in January 1945. From 3 January to 1 March 1945, Portland participated in the operations at Lingayen Gulf and Corregidor. Arriving off Lingayen Gulf on 5 January, and bombarding the vicinity of Cape Bolinao, she entered the Gulf the same day and commenced bombardment of the eastern shore but discontinued immediately when a large wave of Japanese kamikaze planes approached. Portland entered Manila Bay on 15 February, and bombarded the south shore of Corregidor in preparation for landings there. She returned to Leyte Gulf on 1 March for repairs and replenishment, having seen five months of continuous action. From 26 March to 20 April, she joined Task Force 54 (TF 54), which conducted shore bombardments of Okinawa in support of the Allied landings during the Okinawa campaign. The Japanese air arm had been decimated by this point in the war, and the lack of trained and experienced pilots led to the most extensive deployment of the kamikaze; Portland endured 24 air raids, shot down four Japanese aircraft, and assisted in downing two others. From 8 May to 17 June, she supported ground forces on Okinawa providing artillery support for ground forces, departing on 17 June for maintenance at Leyte before returning to Buckner Bay on 6 August, where she remained conducting shore bombardments until the end of the war. Post-war Mainmast and bridge shield from USS Portland, on display at Fort Allen Park. With the termination of hostilities, Portland was designated flagship of Vice Admiral George D. Murray, Commander Mariana Islands, who was to accept the surrender of the Carolines. The ship steamed to Truk Atoll and there Murray, acting for Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, accepted the formal capitulation of the senior Japanese military and civilian officials in ceremonies aboard Portland. She was then selected for Operation Magic Carpet duty, and returned to Pearl Harbor from 21‚Äì24 September embarking 600 troops for transportation to the United States. She crossed the Panama Canal on 8 October and arrived at Portland, Maine, for Navy Day celebrations on 27 October. She then conducted two trans-Atlantic crossings in November and December, bringing troops home from the European Theater. She reported on 11 March 1946 to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for inactivation and assignment to the Reserve Fleet. She decommissioned at Philadelphia Navy Yard on 12 July 1946 and was maintained in the United States Reserve Fleet. While she was identified as one of the few ships that fought through the entire war and not missed any major battle, no attempt was made to save her as a museum ship at either Portland, Maine, or Portland, Oregon. She was struck from the Navy List on 1 March 1959 and sold to Union Minerals and Alloys Corp. in New York on 6 October. She was scrapped at Wainwright Shipyard in Panama City, Florida, during 1961 and 1962. Her tripod mast was preserved at Fort Allen Park, Portland. She received 16 battle stars for World War II service, making her among the most decorated US ships of World War II.

They are operated in present-day service as moving examples of living history, as opposed to static exhibits. The majority of restored trains are operated at heritage railways and railway museums, although they can also be found on the main lines or branch lines of the commercial working railway, operated by specialist railtour companies or museum groups. For authenticity, the location/route of preserved trains is often chosen to match the original trains used. In the United States Eureka & Palisades No. 4, an example of a restored train in the United States. The restoration of historic railway equipment has gained importance in the United States, primarily because of a large amount of steam locomotives and cabooses donated by railroads to cities and museums, many of which have been displayed in parks for many years. Often these restoration projects are accomplished by a local railroad club or chapters of a national organization. Examples of major projects accomplished by clubs are D&RGW; 315, which was displayed in the city park in Durango, Colorado, until removed by the Durango Railway Historical Society and restored to operation, as well as D&RGW; 223, which was displayed at Liberty Park in Salt Lake City, Utah until moved to Ogden and restored by the Golden Spike Chapter of the Railway & Locomotive Historical Society.

While these names generally referred to the entire Upper Mississippi River watershed, French colonial settlement was concentrated along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers in what is now the U.S. states of Illinois and Missouri, with outposts in Indiana. Explored in 1673 from Green Bay to the Arkansas River by the Canadien expedition of Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette, the area was claimed by France. It was settled primarily from the Pays d'en Haut in the context of the fur trade. Over time, the fur trade took some French to the far reaches of the Rocky Mountains, especially along the branches of the broad Missouri River valley. The French name, Pays des Illinois, means \\"Land of the Illinois [plural]\\" and is a reference to the Illinois Confederation, a group of related Algonquian native peoples. Up until 1717, the Illinois Country was governed by the French province of Canada, but by order of King Louis XV, the Illinois Country was annexed to the French province of Louisiana, with the northeastern administrative border being somewhat vaguely on or near the upper Illinois River. The territory thus became known as \\"Upper Louisiana.\\" By the mid-18th century, the major settlements included Cahokia, Kaskaskia, Chartres, Saint Philippe, and Prairie du Rocher, all on the east side of the Mississippi in present-day Illinois; and Ste. Genevieve across the river in Missouri, as well as Fort Vincennes in what is now Indiana. As a consequence of the French defeat in the French and Indian War in 1784, the Illinois Country east of the Mississippi River was ceded to the British and became part of the British Province of Quebec; the land west of the river was ceded to the Spanish (Luisiana). During the American Revolution, Virginian George Rogers Clark, led the Illinois campaign against the British. Illinois Country east of the Mississippi River along with what was then much of Ohio Country, became part of Illinois County, Virginia, claimed by right of conquest. The county was abolished in 1782. In 1784, Virginia ceded its claims. Part of the area was incorporated in the United States' Northwest Territory. The name lived on as Illinois Territory between 1809 and 1818, and as the State of Illinois after its admission to the union in 1818. The residual part of Illinois Country west of the Mississippi was acquired by the United States in the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Location and boundaries 1681 map of the New World: New France and the Great Lakes in the north, with a dark line as the Mississippi River to the west and the mouth of the river (and future New Orleans) then terra incognita The boundaries of the Illinois Country were defined in a variety of ways, but the region now known as the American Bottom was nearly at the center of all descriptions. One of the earliest known geographic features designated as Ilinois was what later became known as Lake Michigan, on a map prepared in 1671 by French Jesuits. Early French missionaries and traders referred to the area southwest and southeast of the lake, including much of the upper Mississippi Valley, by this name. Illinois was also the name given to an area inhabited by the Illiniwek. A map of 1685 labels a large area southwest of the lake les Ilinois; in 1688, the Italian cartographer Vincenzo Coronelli labeled the region (in Italian) as Illinois country. In 1721, the seventh civil and military district of Louisiana was named Illinois. It included more than half of the present state, as well as the land between the Arkansas River and the line of 43 degrees north latitude, and the country between the Rocky Mountains and the Mississippi River. A royal ordinance of 1722‚Äîfollowing the transfer of the Illinois Country's governance from Canada to Louisiana‚Äîmay have featured the broadest definition of the region: all land claimed by France south of the Great Lakes and north of the mouth of the Ohio River, which would include the lower Missouri Valley as well as both banks of the Mississippi. A generation later, trade conflicts between Canada and Louisiana led to a more defined boundary between the French colonies; in 1745, Louisiana governor general Vaudreuil set the northeastern bounds of his domain as the Wabash valley up to the mouth of the Vermilion River (near present-day Danville, Illinois); from there, northwest to le Rocher on the Illinois River, and from there west to the mouth of the Rock River (at present day Rock Island, Illinois). Thus, Vincennes and Peoria were near the limit of Louisiana's reach; the outposts at Ouiatenon (on the upper Wabash near present-day Lafayette, Indiana), Checagou, Fort Miamis (near present-day Fort Wayne, Indiana) and Prairie du Chien operated as dependencies of Canada. This boundary between Canada and the Illinois Country remained in effect until the Treaty of Paris in 1763, after which France surrendered its remaining territory east of the Mississippi to Great Britain. (Although British forces had occupied the \\"Canadian\\" posts in the Illinois and Wabash countries in 1761, they did not occupy Vincennes or the Mississippi River settlements at Cahokia and Kaskaskia until 1764, after the ratification of the peace treaty.) As part of a general report on conditions in the newly conquered lands, Gen. Thomas Gage, then commandant at Montreal, explained in 1762 that, although the boundary between Louisiana and Canada wasn't exact, it was understood the upper Mississippi above the mouth of the Illinois was in Canadian trading territory. Distinctions became somewhat clearer after the Treaty of Paris in 1763, when Britain acquired Canada and the land claimed by France east of the Mississippi and Spain acquired Louisiana west of the Mississippi. Many French settlers moved west across the river to escape British control. On the west bank, the Spanish also continued to refer to the western region governed from St. Louis as the District of Illinois and referred to St. Louis as the city of Illinois. Exploration and settlement Map of western New France, including the Illinois Country, by Vincenzo Coronelli, 1688 The first French explorations of the Illinois Country were in the first half of the 17th century, led by explorers and missionaries based in Canada. √âtienne Br√ªl√© explored the upper Illinois country in 1615 but did not document his experiences. Joseph de La Roche Daillon reached an oil spring at the northeasternmost fringe of the Mississippi River basin during his 1627 missionary journey. In 1669‚Äì70, Father Jacques Marquette, a missionary in French Canada, was at a mission station on Lake Superior, when he met native traders from the Illinois Confederation. He learned about the great river that ran through their country to the south and west. In 1673‚Äì74, with a commission from the Canadian government, Marquette and Louis Jolliet explored the Mississippi River territory from Green Bay to the Arkansas River, including the Illinois River valley. In 1675, Marquette returned to found a Jesuit mission at the Grand Village of the Illinois. Over the next decades missions, trade posts, and forts were established in the region.Native Americans-Historic:The Illinois-Society, The French Illinois State MuseumJacques Marquette 1673  Virtual Museum of New France Canadian Museum of History By 1714, the principal European, non-native inhabitants were Canadien fur traders, missionaries and soldiers, dealing with Native Americans, particularly the group known as the Kaskaskia. The main French settlements were established at Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and Sainte Genevieve. By 1752, the population had risen to 2,573.Guy Fr√©gault, Le Grand Marquis: Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil et la Louisiane (Montreal, 1952), pp. 129‚Äì130 From the 1710s to the 1730s, the Fox Wars between the French, French allied tribes and the Meskwaki (Fox) Native American tribe occurred in what is now northern Illinois, southern Wisconsin, and Michigan, in particular, over the fur trade. During the conflict, in what is now McLean County, Illinois, French and allied forces won a consequential battle against the Meskwaki in 1730. =Fort St. Louis du Rocher= French explorers led by Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle built Fort St. Louis on a large butte by the Illinois River in the winter of 1682. Called La Rocher, the butte provided an advantageous position for the fort above the river. A wooden palisade was the only form of defenses that La Salle used in securing the site. Inside the fort were a few wooden houses and native shelters. The French intended St. Louis to be the first of several forts to defend against English incursions and keep their settlements confined to the East Coast. Accompanying the French to the region were allied members of several native tribes from eastern areas, who integrated with the Kaskaskia: the Miami, Shawnee, and Mahican. The tribes established a new settlement at the base of the butte known as Hotel Plaza. After La Salle's five-year monopoly ended New France governor Joseph-Antoine de La Barre wished to put Fort Saint Louis along with Fort Frontenac under his jurisdiction. By orders of the governor, traders and his officer were escorted to Illinois. On August 11, 1683, LaSalle's armorer, Pierre Prudhomme, obtained approximately one and three-quarters of a mile of the north portage shore. During the earliest of the French and Indian Wars, the French used the fort as a refuge against attacks by Iroquois, who were allied with the British. The Iroquois forced the settlers, then commanded by Henri de Tonti, to abandon the fort in 1691. De Tonti reorganized the settlers at Fort Pimitoui in modern-day Peoria. French Map of North America 1700 (Covens and Mortier ed. 1708) -- \\"PAYS DES ILINOIS\\", near center French troops commanded by Pierre De Liette occupied Fort St. Louis from 1714 to 1718; De Liette's jurisdiction over the region ended when the territory was transferred from Canada to Louisiana. Fur trappers and traders used the fort periodically in the early 18th century until it became too dilapidated. No surface remains of the fort are found at the site today. The region was periodically occupied by a variety of native tribes who were forced westward by the expansion of European settlements. These included the Potawatomi, Ottawa, and Ojibwe. On April 20, 1769, an Illinois Confederation warrior assassinated Chief Pontiac while he was on a diplomatic mission in Cahokia. According to local legend, the Ottawa, along with their allies the Potawatomi, attacked a band of Illini along the Illinois River. The tribe climbed to the butte to seek refuge from the attack. The Ottawa and Potawatomi continued the siege until the Illini tribe starved to death. After hearing the story, Europeans referred to the butte as Starved Rock. =Fort de Chartres= curtain and gatehouse of Fort de Chartres On January 1, 1718, a trade monopoly was granted to John Law and his Company of the West (which was to become the Company of the Indies in 1719). Hoping to make a fortune mining precious metals in the area, the company with a military contingent sent from New Orleans built a fort to protect its interests. Construction began on the first Fort de Chartres (in present-day Illinois) in 1718 and was completed in 1720. The original fort was located on the east bank of the Mississippi River, downriver (south) from Cahokia and upriver of Kaskaskia. The nearby settlement of Prairie du Rocher, Illinois, was founded by French-Canadian colonists in 1722, a few miles inland from the fort. Thomas Hutchins map of settlements in the Illinois Country in 1778 The fort was to be the seat of government for the Illinois Country and help to control the aggressive Fox Indians. The fort was named after Louis, duc de Chartres, son of the regent of France. Because of frequent flooding, another fort was built further inland in 1725. By 1731, the Company of the Indies had gone defunct and turned Louisiana and its government back to the king. The garrison at the fort was removed to Kaskaskia, Illinois in 1747, about 18 miles to the south. A new stone fort was planned near the old fort and was described as \\"nearly complete\\" in 1754, although construction continued until 1760. The new stone fort was headquarters for the French Illinois Country for less than 20 years, as it was turned over to the British in 1763 with the Treaty of Paris at the end of the French and Indian War. The British Crown declared almost all the land between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River from Florida to Newfoundland a Native American territory called the Indian Reserve following the Royal Proclamation of 1763. The government ordered settlers to leave or get a special license to remain. This and the desire to live in a Catholic territory caused many of the Canadiens to cross the Mississippi to live in St. Louis or Ste. Genevieve. The British soon relaxed its policy and later extended the Province of Quebec to the region. The British took control of Fort de Chartres on October 10, 1765 and renamed it Fort Cavendish. The British softened the initial expulsion order and offered the Canadien inhabitants the same rights and privileges enjoyed under French rule. In September 1768, the British established a Court of Justice, the first court of common law in the Mississippi Valley (the French law system is called civil law). After severe flooding in 1772, the British saw little value in maintaining the fort and abandoned it. They moved the military garrison to the fort at Kaskaskia and renamed it Fort Gage. Chartres' ruined but intact magazine is considered the oldest surviving European structure in Illinois and was reconstructed in the 20th century, with much of the rest of the Fort. =Agricultural settlement= According to historian, Carl J. Ekberg, the French settlement pattern in Illinois Country was generally unique in 17th- and 18th-century French North America. These were unlike other such French settlements, which primarily had been organized in separated homesteads along a river with long rectangular plots stretching back from the river (ribbon plots). The Illinois Country French, although they marked long-ribbon plots, did not reside on them. Instead, settlers resided together in farming villages, more like the farming villages of northern France, and practiced communal agriculture.Ekberg (2000), p. 28-32 After the port of New Orleans, along the Mississippi River to the south, was founded in 1718, more African slaves were imported to the Illinois Country for use as agricultural and mining laborers. By the mid-eighteenth century, slaves accounted for as much as a third of the population.Ekberg (2000), p. 2-3 =Other settlements= *In 1675, Jacques Marquette founded the mission of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin at the Grand Village of the Illinois, near present Utica, Illinois, which was destroyed by Iroquois in 1680. Fort Pimiteoui (Old Peoria) circa 1702 *Peoria was at first the southernmost part of New France, then the northernmost part of the French Colony of Louisiana, and finally the westernmost part of the newly formed United States. Fort Crevecoeur was first founded in 1680. Another fort, often called Fort Pimiteoui, and later Old Fort Peoria, was established in 1691.The First European Settlement in Illinois French interests dominated at Peoria for well over a hundred years, from the time the first French explorers came up the Illinois River in 1673 until the first United States settlers began to move into the area around 1815. A small French presence persisted for a time on the east bank of the river, but was gone by about 1846. Today, only faint echoes of French Peoria survive in the street plan of downtown Peoria, and in the name of an occasional street, school, or hotel meeting room: Joliet, Marquette, LaSalle. *The Mission of the Guardian Angel was established near the Chicago portage between 1696-1700. Church of the Holy Family in Cahokia *Cahokia, established in 1696 by French missionaries from Quebec, was one of the earliest permanent settlements in the region. It became one of the most populous of the northern towns. In 1787, it was made the seat of St. Clair County in the Northwest Territory. In 1801, William Henry Harrison, then governor of Indiana Territory, enlarged St. Clair County to administer a vast area extending to the Canada‚ÄìUS border. By 1814, the county had been reduced to almost the size of the present St. Clair County, Illinois. The county seat was shifted from Cahokia to Belleville. On April 20, 1769, the great Indian leader Chief Pontiac was murdered in Cahokia by a chief of the Peoria. *Kaskaskia, established in 1703, was at first small mission station for the French. It flourished to become capital of the Illinois Territory, 1809‚Äì1818, and the first capital of the state of Illinois, 1818-1820. The French built a fort here in 1721, which was destroyed in 1763 by the British. (The fort was situated above what was then the lower course of the Kaskaskia River, but became the new channel of the Mississippi in 1881.) During the American Revolutionary War, General George Rogers Clark took possession of the village in 1778. The residents rang the church bell in celebration, and it became known as the \\"liberty bell\\". (It had been sent in 1741 by King Louis XV.) Flooding and a lateral shift of the river channel in 1881 cut off the old settlement from the mainland of Illinois and destroyed some of the village and its archaeology. Much of the village cemetery was transferred to the higher ground of Fort Kaskaskia State Park across the river. Today visitors can reach the remnants of Kaskaskia only by a bridge and road from the Missouri side. In the Great Flood of 1993, the Mississippi submerged all but a few rooftops and the steeple of the Catholic Church of the Immaculate Conception, built in 1843 and moved brick by brick to the new location on Kaskaskia Island about 1893. *In 1720, Philip Francois Renault, the Director of Mining Operations for the Company of the West, arrived with about 200 laborers and mechanics and 500 African slaves from Saint-Domingue to work the mines. However, the mines yielded only unprofitable coal and lead, providing insufficient revenues for the Company of the West to survive. In 1723, Renault, with his workers and slaves, established the village St. Philippe (on the Bottoms down from the present-day unincorporated community of Renault, Illinois in Monroe County, Illinois.) It was about 3 miles north of Fort de Chartres. This is the first record of African slaves in the region. Some of the French farmers also used slaves for labor, but most families held only a few, if any. The village quickly produced an agricultural surplus, with its goods sold to lower Louisiana, as well as to settlements less successful than those in the Illinois Country, such as Arkansas Post. *The original Ste. Genevieve was established around 1750 along the western banks of the Mississippi River. The village consisted of mostly farmers and merchants of French-Canadian descent from the settlements on the east side. Despite flooding, the town remained in that location until the great flood of 1785 destroyed much property. The villagers decided to move the entire village to higher ground about two miles north and half a mile back from the river floodplain. The city has retained the most buildings of French Colonial architecture in the US. *The French established Fort Orleans in 1723 along the Missouri River near Brunswick, Missouri. *Fort Vincennes, on the Wabash River, later known as St. Vincennes and eventually Vincennes, Indiana, was established in 1732. The British renamed it Fort Sackville after their capture of it in the French and Indian War (also known as the Seven Years' War.) George Rogers Clark renamed it Fort Patrick Henry, for the Governor of Virginia, when he took it in the American Revolution. Although part of the original expansive Illinois Country, as part of the Northwest Territory, it became the seat of a separate county. *The French built Fort de L'Ascension (later, de Massiac) on the Ohio River in 1757 near the present Metropolis, Illinois. *St. Louis was founded in 1764 by French fur traders. In 1765, it was made the capital of Upper Louisiana; and after 1767, control of the region west of the Mississippi was given to the Spanish. In 1780, St. Louis was attacked by British forces, mostly Native Americans, during the American Revolutionary War.Usgennet.org Attack On St. Louis: May 26, 1780. British province of Quebec Following the British occupation of the east bank of the Mississippi in 1764, some Canadien settlers remained in the area, while others crossed the river, forming new settlements such as St. Louis. Illinois Country under American control Map of British America's Province of Quebec and the Illinois Country (center-left) under the Quebec Act of 1774. During the Revolutionary War, General George Rogers Clark took possession of the part of the Illinois Country east of the Mississippi for Virginia. In November 1778, the Virginia legislature created the county of Illinois, comprising all of the lands lying west of the Ohio River to which Virginia had any claim, with Kaskaskia as the county seat. Captain John Todd was named as governor. However, this government was limited to the former Canadien settlements and was rather ineffective. For their assistance to General Clark in the war, settled Canadien and Indian residents of Illinois Country were given full citizenship. Under the Northwest Ordinance and many subsequent treaties and acts of Congress, the Canadien and Indian residents of Vincennes and Kaskaskia were granted specific exemptions, as they had declared themselves citizens of Virginia. The term Illinois Country was sometimes used in legislation to refer to these settlements. Much of the Illinois Country region became an organized territory of the United States with the establishment of the Northwest Territory in 1787. In 1803, the old Illinois Country area west of the Mississippi was gained by the U.S. in the Louisiana Purchase.

It is equivalent to the rank of sergeant in the Army and Marine Corps, and staff sergeant in the Air Force. Overview Similar to petty officer third class, advancement to petty officer second class is dependent on time in service, performance evaluations by superiors, and rate (technical specialty) examinations. The advancement cycle is currently every 6 months. Only a certain number of billets (job openings for this rate) open up biannually and all third-class petty officers compete. The top scorers are chosen for advancement, but only in sufficient quantities to fill the billets available. Job description Petty officers serve a dual role as both technical experts and as leaders. Unlike the sailors below them, there is no such thing as an \\"undesignated petty officer.\\" Every petty officer has both a rate (rank) and rating (job, similar to an MOS in other branches). A petty officer's full title is a combination of the two. Thus, a petty officer second class, who has the rating of interior communications electrician would properly be called an interior communications electrician second class. The term petty officer is, then, only used in abstract, the general sense, when referring to a group of petty officers of different ratings, or when the petty officer's rating is unknown. Often, the petty officer is just referred to by the shorthand designation, without using the surname. Thus EM2 Reyes would just be called EM2. A petty officer second class may be generically referred to as PO2 when the sailor's rating is not known, although some prefer to be called simply \\"Petty Officer (Martinez).\\" To address a petty officer, one would say, \\"Petty Officer Meyer\\", \\"Meyer\\", or \\"Sailor\\" (the latter two forms being acceptable for use by those equal or greater in rate than the Petty Officer unless in a familiar setting, such as by those who work closely with the Petty Officer). It is uncommon to address a petty officer as simply \\"Petty Officer\\", the way one might address an NCO in the Marine Corps as \\"Sergeant\\". Also acceptable, but archaic, would be to address a petty officer or chief petty officer of any grade as \\"Mister Meyer\\" or \\"Ms. Meyer\\". The use of \\"Ms.\\" or \\"Mister\\" is commonly only in reference to junior commissioned officers or warrant officers. Short form naming Each rating has an official abbreviation, such as GM for gunner's mate, BU for builder, or BM for boatswain's mate. When combined with the petty officer level, this gives the shorthand for the petty officer's rate, such as IT2 for \\"information systems technician second class\\". It is common practice to refer to the petty officer by this shorthand in all but the most formal correspondence (such as printing and inscription on awards). Unlike most rates, the Aircrew survival equipmentman rate uses their former title of parachute rigger for abbreviation and are still referred as PRs and parachute riggers in the military community after undergoing a rating name change in 1986. Promotion system The Navy uses promotion points that they call \\"final multiple score\\" system, which considers the whole person by calculating a candidate's performance, experience, and knowledge into the individual's final multiple score. To advance a candidate must meet the time in rate eligibility, pass the advancement test, and have a final multiple higher than the minimum required to advance. Among enlisted sailors, 12 consecutive years of good conduct (categorized as no court-martial convictions and no non-judicial punishments) entitles the sailor to wear a good conduct variation of their rate insignia: the chevrons which are normally red are replaced with gold. The perched eagle remains silver. However, the high year tenure initiative mandates that a petty officer second class may only have 16 years of service. If a PO2 fails to make petty officer first class within that time, the petty officer is involuntarily separated for not meeting advancement requirements. However, this may be waived in the event the sailor holds a critical rate, Navy Enlisted Classification or security clearance. Uniform All U.S. Coast Guard petty officers wear red chevrons and red service stripes, until the rate of chief petty officer, where both chevrons and service stripes are gold. In the US Navy, all petty officers wear red stripes and chevrons until they reach 12 consecutive years of service with good conduct (as determined by eligibility for the Navy Good Conduct Medal as its criteria).

History  In 2002 plans were ratified by the Welsh Assembly to create two 'super' schools in Wrexham, with an emphasis on vocational education. Opposition to the plans was received from parents, with a petition of over 1000 signatures was delivered to the Wrexham County Council in April 2002. Nearby Yale College, which was to offset the some costs of the project by buying the Groves school and selling land, dropped out. By late 2003 it became apparent that the original ¬£12 million budget for upgrades would fall short by about ¬£10 million because inflation was not accounted for in estimates. Nonetheless, the county council approved overspends allowing the schools to be upgraded as planned. Both of the new schools serve around 2500 pupils age 11 through to 16. Three secondary schools were merged into two schools: Rhosnesni (formerly known as St. David's School), and Ysgol Clywedog (formerly known as Bryn Offa). The third school, Groves, was used as a temporary site for Rhosnesni, Ysgol Clywedog and another local school, St Joseph's Catholic High School, while improvements were made to their permanent sites. The Groves was shut down entirely in 2006 and remained unused until its partial demolition in 2013/'14. As of 2016, the oldest part of the Groves school building still remains and there is talk of demolition. In 2014 a report by Wrexham Council showed that there had been a big fall in admissions to Wrexham's super schools. The percentage of primary school pupils applying to Rhosnesni had fallen from 71% to 36%. Rhosnesni was one of 40 Welsh schools that was chosen to take part in a Welsh government scheme to improve standards.  Location  Previously St Davids High School (Ysgol Dewi Sant), Rhosnesni High School is situated on Rhosnesni Lane in the town of Wrexham, North Wales. It opened in 2003 at a temporary site on Pen-y- Maes Avenue and later moving to its current site after the school buildings were updated and opened in September 2004, although an official opening ceremony was not conducted until April 2005. Students from the former schools were asked to create the logo and uniform which consists of a Royal blue blazer, optional black V neck pullover, white shirt, black tailored trousers or knee length A line skirt, knee length black socks or black tights, black formal shoes with a blue and yellow diagonally striped tie. The logo is a shield divided into quarters on the diagonal with the letters YRHS (an abbreviation of Ysgol Rhosnesni High School). The students also created a new motto, \\"Respect, Honesty, Success\\" which cleverly shares the school's initials. As of September 2018 the headteacher Mr Brant is expecting to raise the schools reputation, performance and standards following an end of year newsletter referencing violations in dress code and behavioural expectations will no longer be ignored. True to his word in excess of 90 students were either sent home or detained in the hall for the duration of the first day with issues such as incorrect footwear and inappropriate skirts being the main issue. This proved controversial with some parents taking to social media to vent fury while many others welcomed the tough approach while giving their backing to the new regime as a long time due.

The term was popularized by the political scientist Ronald Inglehart in his 1977 book The Silent Revolution, in which he discovered that the formative affluence experienced by the post-war generations was leading some of them to take their material security for granted and instead place greater importance on non-material goals such as self-expression, autonomy, freedom of speech, gender equality and environmentalism. Inglehart argued that with increasing prosperity, such postmaterial values would gradually increase in the publics of advanced industrial societies through the process of intergenerational replacement. Postmaterialism is a tool in developing an understanding of modern culture. It can be considered in reference of three distinct concepts of materialism. The first kind of materialism, and the one in reference to which the word postmaterialism is used most often, refers to materialism as a value-system relating to the desire for fulfillment of material needs (such as security, sustenance and shelter) and an emphasis on material luxuries in a consumerist society. A second referent is the materialist conception of history held by many socialists, most notably Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, as well as their philosophic concept of dialectical materialism. The third definition of materialism concerns the philosophical argument that matter is the only existing reality. The first concept is sociological, the second is both philosophical and sociological, and the third is philosophical. Depending on which of the three above notions of materialism are being discussed, postmaterialism can be an ontological postmaterialism, an existentialistic postmaterialism, an ethical postmaterialism, or a political- sociological postmaterialism, which is also the best known. History The sociological theory of postmaterialism was developed in the 1970s by Ronald Inglehart. After extensive survey research, Inglehart postulated that the Western societies under the scope of his survey were undergoing transformation of individual values, switching from materialist values, emphasizing economic and physical security, to a new set of postmaterialist values, which instead emphasized autonomy and self-expression. Inglehart argued that rising prosperity was gradually liberating the publics of advanced industrial societies from the stress of basic acquisitive or materialistic needs. Observing that the younger people were much more likely to embrace postmaterialist values, Inglehart speculated that this silent revolution was not merely a case of a life-cycle change, with people becoming more materialist as they aged, but a genuine example of generational replacement causing intergenerational value change. The theory of intergenerational change is based on two key hypotheses: * The scarcity hypothesis * The socialization hypothesis =Scarcity hypothesis= Inglehart assumed that individuals pursue various goals in something akin to a hierarchical order. While people may universally aspire to freedom and autonomy, the most pressing material needs like hunger, thirst and physical security have to be satisfied first, since they are immediately linked with survival. According to Inglehart's interpretation of Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of human goals, while scarcity prevails, these materialistic goals will have priority over postmaterialist goals like belonging, esteem, and aesthetic and intellectual satisfaction. However, once the satisfaction of the survival needs can be taken for granted, the focus will gradually shift to these \\"non-material\\" goods. =Socialization hypothesis= The relationship between material conditions and value priorities is not one of immediate adjustment. A large body of evidence indicates that people's basic values are largely fixed when they reach adulthood, and change relatively little thereafter. Therefore, cohorts which often experienced economic scarcity would ceteris paribus (all things being equal) place a high value on meeting economic needs (such as valuing economic growth above protecting the environment) and on safety needs (will support more authoritarian styles of leadership, will exhibit strong feelings of national pride, will be strongly in favour of maintaining a large, strong army and will be more willing to sacrifice civil liberties for the sake of law and order). On the other hand, cohorts who have experienced sustained high material affluence start to give high priority to values such as individual improvement, personal freedom, citizen input in government decisions, the ideal of a society based on humanism, and maintaining a clean and healthy environment. Together, these two hypotheses carry the implication that, given long periods of material affluence, a growing part of society will embrace postmaterialist value systems, an implication which has been indeed borne out internationally in the past 30 years of survey data. The postmaterial orientations acquired by each cohort during socialization have been observed to remain remarkably steady over the time-frame of multiple decades, being a more stable value-system in contrast to the more volatile political and social attitudes. =Measuring postmaterialism= There are several ways of empirically measuring the spread of postmaterialism in a society. A common and relatively simple way is by creating an index from survey respondents' patterns of responses to a series of items which were designed to measure personal political priorities. The theoretical assumptions and the empirical research connected with the concept of postmaterialism have received considerable attention and critical discussion in the human sciences. Amongst others, the validity, the stability, and the causation of postmaterialism has been doubted. The so-called \\"Inglehart-index\\" has been included in several surveys (e.g., General Social Survey, World Values Survey, Eurobarometer, ALLBUS, Turning Points of the Life-Course). The time series in ALLBUS (German General Social Survey) is particularly comprehensive. From 1980 to 1990 the share of \\"pure post-materialists\\" increased from 13 to 31 per cent in West Germany. After the economic and social stress caused by German reunification in 1990 it dropped to 23 per cent in 1992 and stayed on that level afterwards. The ALLBUS sample from the less affluent population in East Germany show much lower portions of postmaterialists (1991: 15 per cent, 1992: 10 per cent, 1998: 12 per cent). International data from the 2000 World Values Survey show the highest percentage of postmaterialists in Australia (35 per cent) followed by Austria (30 per cent), Canada (29 per cent), Italy (28 per cent), Argentina (25 per cent), United States (25 per cent), Sweden (22 per cent), Netherlands (22 per cent), Puerto Rico (22 per cent) etc. As increasing postmaterialism is based on the abundance of material possessions or resources, it should not be mixed indiscriminately with asceticism or general denial of consumption. In some way postmaterialism may be described as super-materialism. German data show that there is a tendency towards this orientation among young people, in the economically rather secure public service, and in the managerial middle class. Recently, the issue of a \\"second generation of postmaterialism\\" appearing on the scene of worldwide civil society, to a large extent conceived as their \\"positive ideological embodiment\\", has been brought up by cultural scientist Roland Benedikter in his seven-volume book series Postmaterialismus (2001‚Äì2005).

In November 2008, Proposition 8 was also passed by voters, again only allowing marriage between one man and one woman. The Act was proposed by means of the initiative process. It was authored by state Senator William \\"Pete\\" Knight and is known informally as the Knight initiative. Voters adopted the measure on March 7, 2000, with 61% in favor to 39% against.4,618,673 votes versus 2,909,370 against www.census.gov/census2000/states/ca.html. The margin of victory surprised many, since a Field Poll immediately prior to the election estimated support at 53%, with 40% against and 7% undecided.http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_10497209 The Act added Section 308.5 of the Family Code, which read \\"Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California\\". Because the Act was an ordinary statute, it could be struck down if it were inconsistent with the state constitution, as happened on May 15, 2008, when the state supreme court, ruling in In re Marriage Cases, declared that same-sex couples had a constitutional right to marry.California Supreme Court. re Marriage Cases (2008) 43 Cal.4th 757 (76 Cal.Rptr.3d 683, 183 P.3d 384) This 4‚Äì3 decision invalidated Proposition 22 and some related California laws. Proposition 22 provoked debate long after its passage. In November 2008 California voters overturned the In re Marriage Cases decision by approving an amendment of the state constitution called Proposition 8. In June 2010, Proposition 8 was declared unconstitutional by U.S district judge Vaughn Walker based on the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. In June 2013, the United States Supreme Court in Hollingsworth v. Perry ruled that the Intervenor-Defendants had no Article III standing to appeal Walker's ruling, keeping Proposition 8 unenforceable throughout California and enabling same-sex marriage to resume just two days after the decision. Statutory framework Prior to 1977, marriage was defined in Section 4100 of the California Civil Code. This stated that marriage is \\"a personal relation arising out of a civil contract, to which consent of the parties making that contract is necessary\\".Calif. Civil Code section 4100 prior to 1977: Stats. 1969, ch. 1608, s. 8, p. 3314; amended to incorporate explicit gender requirement: Calif. Stats. 1977, ch. 339, s. 1, p. 1295; recodified at Calif. Family Code section 300 without substantive change: Calif. Stats. 1992, ch.162 s. 10, p. 474 While related sections of the law made references to sex, a State Assembly committee that was debating adding sex-specific terms to this section in 1977 noted: \\"Under existing law it is not clear whether partners of the same sex can get married\\".California Assembly Committee on the Judiciary, Bill Digest for A.B. 607 (1977) That year, the legislature amended the legal definition of marriage to remove any ambiguity. In 1992 the legal definition of marriage was moved from the Civil Code to Section 300 of the Family Code. When Proposition 22 came before voters, marriage was defined in the Family Code as \\"a personal relation arising out of a civil contract between a man and a woman, to which the consent of the parties capable of making that contract is necessary\\" [italics added].California Family Code, Section 300 Even though the definition governing who may marry explicitly precluded contracting a same-sex marriage in California, a separate provision, Section 308, governed recognition of marriages contracted elsewhere. This stated that a \\"marriage contracted outside this state that would be valid by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the marriage was contracted is valid in this state\\".California Family Code, Section 308 Advocates of Proposition 22 described Section 308 as a \\"loophole\\", apparently forcing California to recognize a same-sex marriage validly contracted in some other state.2000 California Primary Election, Voter Information Guide, Rebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 22 To address this, Proposition 22 did not reword the existing provisions of the Family Code, but added to them the declaration that \\"only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California\\".2000 California Primary Election, Voter Information Guide, Text of Proposition 22 The official citation of Proposition 22, the \\"California Defense of Marriage Act\\", is almost the same as that of a federal law, the Defense of Marriage Act, which was enacted by Congress in 1996. This federal law had a similar purpose, and was intended to prevent any state from being obligated to recognize a same-sex marriage contracted in another state.  Results of vote 250px Disputes over its effect Central to many subsequent disputes over Prop 22's effect is a distinction between statutes enacted by the legislature and initiative statutes enacted directly by the electorate. The legislature is free to amend or rescind its own enactments, but voters must approve any attempt by the legislature to amend or repeal an initiative statute unless the initiative itself states otherwise.California Constitution, Article II , Section 10. =Controversy over domestic partnerships= In 1999, California enacted the first in a series of domestic partnership provisions. California courts have entertained several challenges to legislative expansions of the domestic partnership scheme enacted after Prop 22. Generally, these challenges alleged that the legislature inappropriately amended Prop 22 by making California's domestic partnership scheme too similar to marriage, or more broadly, that Prop 22 made 'any' subsequent recognition of same-sex partnerships beyond the legislature's inherent power. California Courts of Appeal rejected those claims, noting that domestic partnerships already existed as a legal institution separate from marriage at the time Prop 22 was enacted.Knight v. Superior Court (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 18; Armijo v. Miles (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1405 =Controversy over marriage licensing within California= In September 2005, the California legislature passed a bill, A.B. 849, eliminating the gender requirements for marriage now found in Family Code section 300. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed the bill. In his veto message, Schwarzenegger argued that passing a law that would implicitly repeal Section 308.5 required the assent of the electorate (and separately made note of pending court challenges).Legislative history of A.B. 849 (2005), Legislative Counsel of California. In ruling on the disputes between Prop 22 and the domestic partnership enactments, California Courts of Appeal have reached differing conclusions as to Prop 22's scope within the marriage statutes. In Armijo v. Miles, the Second Appellate District distinguished Prop 22 from the case at bar by noting, in part, that the initiative prevented the recognition of same-sex marriages conducted outside California: > The legislative analysis and the ballot arguments readily demonstrate that > Proposition 22 was crafted with a prophylactic purpose in mind. It was > designed to prevent same-sex couples who could marry validly in other > countries or who in the future could marry validly in other states from > coming to California and claiming, in reliance on Family Code section 308, > that their marriages must be recognized as valid marriages. With the passage > of Proposition 22, then, only opposite-sex marriages validly contracted > outside this state will be recognized as valid in California.Armijo v. Miles > (2005) 127 Cal. App.4th 1405, 1424 The Armijo court may not have ruled that the historical purpose of Prop 22 limited its scope to out of state marriages. The court appears to have ultimately presumed that Proposition 22 did indeed apply to in-state arrangements deemed to be \\"marriages,\\" but held that the challenged wrongful death statute did not violate that prohibition: > The question remaining is whether the portion of AB 2580 that amends the > wrongful death statute subverts Proposition 22. Defendants' position that it > does is based on the faulty premise that the right to sue for wrongful death > is an exclusive benefit of marriage. It is not. Less than a week later, on April 4, 2005, the Third Appellate District ruled more explicitly, in Knight v. Superior Court, that Prop 22 also included within the initiative's ambit marriages licensed within the state: > The plain language of Proposition 22 and its initiative statute, section > 308.5, reaffirms the definition of marriage in section 300, by stating that > only marriage between a man and a woman shall be valid and recognized in > California. This limitation ensures that California will not legitimize or > recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions, as it otherwise would > be required to do pursuant to section 308, and that California will not > permit same-sex partners to validly marry within the state.Knight v. > Superior Court (Schwarzenegger) (2005) 128 Cal. App.4th 14, 23‚Äì24 As with Armijo, the Knight court upheld the challenged statute on the grounds that it did not constitute a \\"marriage\\" for purposes of Prop 22 or Section 300. The cases differed, however, in that Armijo appeared to rely on a narrow observation that a particular benefit was not exclusive to marriage, while Knight upheld a broad domestic partnership statute against challenges it left almost no substantive difference between the two institutions. Parties in subsequent cases, including the same-sex marriage cases, have noted the apparent split between the appellate courts with respect to its scope. As the ultimate rulings in these cases arguably did not require a finding that Prop 22 applies to in-state marriages (both were upheld against a challenge that they constituted marriage under Prop 22, the same result that would have obtained if they had ruled Prop 22 did not apply to in-state marriages), some argue that these findings are dicta.Liebert, Mark. \\"AB 19 Bill Analysis .\\" California Assembly Committee on the Judiciary. 21 Apr 2005; also, Dolan, Maura. \\"Courts Likely to Have Final Say on Gay-Marriage Bill.\\" Los Angeles Times, 7 Sep 2005; and, Kroll, Panda. \\"California's Same-sex Yo-Yo .\\" Citations (Ventura County Bar Association), Oct 2005. On the flip side, an argument can be made that these holdings are not dicta, as both courts ruled on the merits of whether or not a challenged in-state arrangement constituted a \\"marriage\\" for purposes of Prop 22, an allegation that would be moot if either court believed Prop 22 permitted in-state marriages. In 2008, the California Supreme Court resolved the controversy in ruling on the constitutionality of statutes limiting marriage to a man and a woman: \\"this provision reasonably must be interpreted to apply both to marriages performed in California and those performed in other jurisdictions.\\" Invalidation Separately, numerous challenges to the constitutionality of the opposite-sex requirements found in California's marriage statutes, including Prop 22, came before the courts. A San Francisco trial court threw out all of the gender requirements on state constitutional grounds. On appeal, an intermediate court reversed that decision. In December 2006, the California Supreme Court voted unanimously to review all six cases and held oral argument on March 4, 2008, consolidating the cases as In re Marriage Cases. The Court ruled on May 15, 2008, that Proposition 22 violated the state Constitution and was therefore invalid.http://www.sfgate.com/cgi- bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/05/15/BAGAVNC5K.DTL (San Francisco Chronicle) Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger immediately issued a statement pledging to uphold the ruling, and repeated his pledge to oppose Proposition 8, a constitutional amendment initiative that would override the Court's ruling and again ban same sex marriages by placing the text of Proposition 22 in the State Constitution. Proposition 22 has been officially repealed, effective January 1, 2015. Governor Brown signed SB 1306 on July 7, 2014.

Finnish Sign Language (suomalainen viittomakieli in Finnish) is the sign language most commonly used in Finland. There are 3,000 (2012 estimate) Finnish deaf who have Finnish Sign Language as a first language. As the Finnish system records users by their written language, not their spoken alone, nearly all deaf people that sign are assigned this way and may be subsumed into the overall Finnish language figures. Historically the aim was oralism, whereby deaf people were taught to speak oral Finnish, even if they could not hear it, thus older people are recorded under these figures. In 2014, only 500 people registered Finnish Sign Language as their first language. There are several sign languages that come under this label; FSL for those that can see; Signed Finnish, which does not follow the same grammatical rules, and a version for those that are blind and deaf. Thus, there are around 8,000 people that use a Finnish Sign Language linguistically. Many estimates say 5,000, but these are exaggerations derived from the 14,000 deaf people in Finland (many of whom do not speak Finnish Sign Language). Finnish Sign Language is derived from Swedish Sign Language, which is a different language from Finnish Swedish Sign Language (which is Swedish Finnish language derived from Finnish Sign Language, of which there are an estimated 90 speakers in Finland), from which it began to separate as an independent language in the middle of the 19th century. Finnish legislation recognized Finnish Sign Language as one of Finland's domestic languages in 1995 when it was included in the renewed constitution. Finland then became the third country in the world to recognize a sign language as a natural language and the right to use it as a mother tongue. Courses in \\"sign language\\" have been taught in Finland since the 1960s. At that time, instruction taught signs but followed Finnish word order (see Manually Coded Language). Later, as research on sign languages in general and Finnish Sign Language in particular determined that sign languages tend to have a very different grammar from oral languages, the teaching of Finnish Sign Language and Signed Finnish diverged.

He was a graduate of Dartmouth (1959), Tufts Medical School and taught at University Hospital in Boston. He started a private practice in psychiatry in 1968 and later moved to Los Angeles in 1979 where he was a professor of psychiatry at UCLA. He founded and managed the Viscott Center for Natural Therapy in Beverly Hills, Newport Beach and Pasadena, California. Biography In 1980 Viscott began presenting his own full-time show on talk radio, and was notably one of the first psychiatrists to do so (talk station KABC). He screened telephone calls and gave considerable amount of free psychological counselling to his on-air \\"patients.\\" In 1987 Viscott briefly had his own live syndicated TV show, Getting in Touch with Dr. David Viscott, providing much the same service as his radio show. In fact, the shows ran concurrently. In the early 1990s he had a weekly call-in therapy television program on KNBC in Los Angeles early Sunday morning after Saturday Night Live, titled Night Talk with Dr. David Viscott. Viscott's signature style was to attempt to isolate an individual's source of emotional problems in a very short amount of time. Many of his books were of a self-help nature, written to assist the individual with his/her own examination of life. His autobiography, The Making of a Psychiatrist, was a best-seller, a Book of the Month Club Main Selection, and nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. Along with psychiatric advice, he would fall back on his medical knowledge to regularly devote entire segments of radio to answering medical questions. During these segments he would give medical advice. Many of the questions answered had to do with pharmacological advice. This was unique in the world of talk radio. Viscott's popularity peaked in the early 1990s, and then fell sharply. A separation from his wife, followed by declining health, occurred at about the same time that he left the air waves. He died in 1996 of heart failure complicated by a diabetic condition. At the time, he was living alone in Los Angeles. He is survived by three of his four children: Elizabeth, Penelope, and Jonathan. The Simpsons In the television show The Simpsons, the character Dr. Marvin Monroe's voice was based on Viscott.Groening, Matt (2001).

However, Monroe is seen alive in the fifteenth season in \\"Diatribe of a Mad Housewife\\" purchasing a copy of Marge's novel, The Harpooned Heart, stating simply that he had \\"...been very sick\\" when asked about his long absence by Marge.

The name was adopted during World War I by members of the Battenberg family residing in the United Kingdom due to rising anti-German sentiment amongst the British public. The name is a direct Anglicisation of the German Battenberg (literally Batten Mountain), a small town in Hesse. The title of count of Battenberg, later prince of Battenberg, was granted to a morganatic branch of the House of Hesse-Darmstadt, itself a cadet branch of the House of Hesse, in the mid 19th century. The family now includes the Marquesses of Milford Haven (and formerly the Marquesses of Carisbrooke), as well as the Earls Mountbatten of Burma. Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, the consort of Queen Elizabeth II, adopted the surname of Mountbatten from his mother's family in 1947, although he is a member of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg by patrilineal descent. Lady Louise Mountbatten became Queen Consort of Sweden, after having married Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden. Origins The Mountbatten family are a branch of the German house of Battenberg. The Battenberg family was a morganatic branch of the House of Hesse-Darmstadt, rulers of the Grand Duchy of Hesse in Germany. The first member of the House of Battenberg was Julia Hauke, whose brother-in- law Grand Duke Louis III of Hesse created her Countess of Battenberg with the style Illustrious Highness in 1851, on the occasion of her morganatic marriage to Grand Duke Louis' brother Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine. Julia was elevated in her title to Princess of Battenberg with the style Serene Highness (HSH) in 1858. Two of Alexander and Julia's sons, Prince Henry of Battenberg and Prince Louis of Battenberg, became associated with the British Royal Family. Prince Henry married The Princess Beatrice, the youngest daughter of Queen Victoria. Prince Louis married Victoria's granddaughter, Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, and became the First Sea Lord of the Royal Navy. Due to anti-German feelings prevalent in Britain during World War I, Prince Louis, his children, and his nephews (the living sons of Prince Henry), renounced their German titles and changed their name to the more English sounding Mountbatten. (They rejected an alternative translation, \\"Battenhill\\".) Their cousin, George V compensated the princes with British peerages. Prince Louis became the 1st Marquess of Milford Haven, while Prince Alexander, Prince Henry's eldest son, became the 1st Marquess of Carisbrooke. Members =Marquesses of Milford Haven= Louis Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Milford Haven The marquessate of Milford Haven was created in 1917 for Prince Louis of Battenberg, the former First Sea Lord, and a relation to the British Royal family. He was at the same time made Earl of Medina and Viscount Alderney, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Princess Alice of Battenberg never took the name Mountbatten as she married Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark in 1903; her son, Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, took the name upon becoming a naturalised British citizen. * Louis Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Milford Haven (1854‚Äì1921) m.

Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten married Princess Elizabeth, daughter of King George VI of the United Kingdom, on 20 November 1947. In 1952, on the accession of his wife as Queen Elizabeth II, there was some dispute regarding the dynasty to which descendants of Elizabeth and Phillip would belong. Queen Mary (the new Queen's grandmother) expressed to Prime Minister Winston Churchill her aversion to the idea of the House of Mountbatten succeeding the House of Windsor as the royal dynasty. Winston Churchill raised the matter in Parliament where it was decided that the name of the Royal House would remain Windsor, as decreed in perpetuity by Queen Mary's husband, King George V. * Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (b. 1921) m.

While the Order specifically applies the surname \\"Mountbatten-Windsor\\" to Elizabeth's male-line descendants not holding Royal styles and titles, \\"Mountbatten- Windsor\\" has been formally used by some of her descendants who do hold Royal styles. The surname was first officially used by Princess Anne in 1973, in the wedding register for her marriage to Mark Phillips. Prince William and his wife Catherine used the names \\"Monsieur et Madame Mountbatten-Windsor\\" when filing a French lawsuit against the French magazine Closer. On 8 May 2019, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex announced the name of their son to be Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. Mountbatten-Windsor differs from the official name of the British Royal Family or Royal House, which remains Windsor. The adoption of the Mountbatten-Windsor surname applies only to members of the Royal Family who are descended from Elizabeth, and not, for example, to her cousins, or descendants of her sister, Princess Margaret. Legacy The city of Ottawa, Ontario, erected Mountbatten Avenue in memory of the 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma. A Royal Canadian Sea Cadets corps, RCSCC No. 134 Admiral Mountbatten, was named after him in 1946. A bronze statue by Franta Belsky of Lord Mountbatten of Burma was erected in 1983 outside the Foreign Office, overlooking Horse Guards Parade. The earl is dressed in the uniform of an Admiral of the Fleet. The Mountbatten Institute (formerly known as the Mountbatten Internship Programme), an organization based in New York and London dedicated to fostering work experience and cultural exchange by placing international graduate students abroad to earn postgraduate and degrees was set up by his eldest daughter, Patricia, 2nd Countess Mountbatten. It was named in honour of the countess's father, the 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma. Despite the family's well-known connections with the Royal Navy, the Mount Batten Peninsula, overlooking the Royal Naval Base of Devonport, England, is not named after them but after Sir William Batten, a 17th-century Surveyor of the Navy.

To date, there are 164 state parties to the treaty. One state (the Marshall Islands) has signed but not ratified the treaty, while 32 UN states, including China, Russia, and the United States have not; making a total of 33 United Nations states not party.  Chronology  1939 Landmines are first used widely in World War II. 1977 During the Geneva Convention, one provision is amended to prohibit the targeting of civilian populations by indiscriminate weapons in wartime. 1980 October: The Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects (CCW) is adopted by a United Nations Conference in Geneva. Among the three annexed Protocols the \\"Protocol on prohibitions or restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices\\" (Protocol II) established some restrictions on the use of anti-personnel landmines.Stuart Maslen: The Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction. Point 0.29, p. 16 in: Oxford Commentaries on International Law, Commentaries on Arms Control Treaties, Volume 1, Oxford University Press, 2004; ; 1991 Six NGOs supporting a ban of landmines begin organizing the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), established the following year. 1992 October: The Steering committee of the ICBL issued a call for an international ban on the use, production, stockpiling and sale, transfer or export of anti-personnel landmines.Stuart Maslen, (2004) Point 0.35, note 98, p. 19 1993 9 February: France formally submitted a request to the Secretary-General of the UN to convene a Review Conference of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) in accordance with its Article 8 in order to strengthen the provisions in the Convention on the use of anti-personnel landmines.Stuart Maslen,(2004) Point 0.34, p. 18 The First International NGO Conference on Landmines is held in London, organised by the ICBL and acknowledging Jody Williams as the organization's coordinator. The US Department of State publishes its report Hidden Killer: The Global Problem with Uncleared Landmines, and the ICBL issues the study Landmines: A deadly Legacy. 16 December: The UN General Assembly adopts Resolution 48/79 which formally welcomed the request to convene a Review Conference of the CCW, encouraged the establishment of a group of governmental experts to prepare this Conference and called upon the maximum number of States to attend.(operative paragraphs 5‚Äì7) Stuart Maslen,(2004) Point 0.34, p. 18/19 1994 24 February: The President of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Cornelio Sommaruga, declared that from a humanitarian point of view; a \\"worldwide ban on anti-personnel mines was the only truly effective solution\\" to come to terms with the problem.Stuart Maslen (2004) Point 0.37, p. 20 Subsequently, certain UN bodies such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) the United Nations Children‚Äôs Fund and the Secretary-General himself called for a total ban on anti-personnel mines.Stuart Maslen (2004) Point 0.38, p. 20 10 July: The Group of Seven Industrialised Nations (G7) at its meeting in Naples i. a. assigned priority to the problem of APM‚Äôs.Stuart Maslen (2004), Point 0.38, p. 20 September: At the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) US President Bill Clinton called for the \\"eventual elimination\\" of anti-personnel mines. 15 December: The UN General Assembly adopts Resolution 49/75 D \\"Moratorium on the Export of Anti-Personnel Land- Mines\\", which urges States to declare such a moratorium, stating i. a.: \\"Recognizing that States can move effectively towards the ultimate goal of the eventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines as viable and humane alternatives are developed\\". \\"Emphasizes the importance of the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects and its Protocols as the authoritative international instrument governing the responsible use of anti-personnel land-mines and related devices.\\" (operative paragraph 4) \\"Encourages further international efforts to seek solutions to the problems caused by anti-personnel-mines, with a view to their eventual elimination\\" (operative paragraph 6).Stuart Maslen (2004) op. cit.Text of this Resolution in Appendix 2, p. 342-343 1995 The first national law to ban anti- personnel landmines is passed in Belgium. 12 May: The Council of the European Union adopts a \\"Common Action\\" on anti-personnel landmines including a common moratorium on the export of anti-personnel landmines. The improvement of the legal restrictions on the use of anti-personnel mines contained in Protocol II of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) proved to be an uphill task. Four meetings of the group of governmental experts were necessary to prepare the basis for the Review Conference of this Convention because of difficulties to reach consensus.Stuart Maslen (2004) Point 0.39, p. 20 25 September to 13 October: The first Review Conference of the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) was finally held in Vienna (Austria). The focus was on its Protocol II, as it was the authoritative international instrument governing the responsible use of anti-personnel land-mines. Many improvements were proposed, but in spite of intensive debates, did not find consensus. The Review Conference therefore had to be suspended.Stuart Maslen (2004) Point 0.38, p. 21 12 December: The United Nations General Assembly adopts Resolution 50/70 O \\"Moratorium on the Export of Anti-Personnel Land- Mines\\", urging States to declare such a moratorium and to build consensus towards an agreement when the Review Conference (of the CCW Convention) reconvenes.

April: The first Draft of what later became the \\"Ottawa Convention\\" was informally made by the Austrian representative at the Review Conference of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), Dr. Werner Ehrlich, out of frustration with the lack of progress achieved towards a total ban at this Conference.Stuart Maslen: (2004) op. cit. Point 0.43, and note 128, page 24.

It represents the essence of what would subsequently be elaborated into the first Austrian Draft text of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention Stuart Maslen, (2004) Point 0.47, p. 25 22 April ‚Äì 3 May 1996: The Review Conference of the CCW resumed again its work in Geneva. 28 April: At the presentation of the first Draft of the Convention by the author at a meeting among States supporting a total ban and relevant NGO‚Äôs, this project was seen only as a \\"remote possibility\\", and therefore not even discussed.Werner Ehrlich, (1996) p. 194; 3 May: At the resumed Review Conference of the CCWC in Geneva the \\"Amended Protocol II\\" is finally adopted by consensus. The reaction of many States to this result was quite negative as its provisions were widely considered to be overly complex and insufficiently stringent to deal with the humanitarian crisis created by APM‚Äôs.Stuart Maslen (2004) op. cit. Point 0.40, p. 21/22 The new restrictions on the use of APM‚Äôs were qualified even as \\"woefully inadequate\\" by the ICRC.Stuart Maslen (2004) op. cit. Point 0.41, p. 22 At the closing session of the Review Conference Canada announced that it would host a meeting of pro-ban States in summer.Stuart Maslen (2004) op. cit. Point 0.44, p. 24 while the Austrian Representative announced the preparation of the draft of a Convention on a total Ban of APM‚Äôs Werner Ehrlich, (1996) p. 194 May: At an expert meeting of the European Union Dr. Ehrlich proposed to revise the \\"Common Action\\" adopted on 12 May 1995, in order to move ahead and to support the project of a Convention on a total ban of APM‚Äôs; and suggested that the EU should prepare the draft of a Resolution on an enlarged moratorium (including use and production of APM‚Äôs) and on a total ban for the next General Assembly of the UN. The first proposal found consensus, not the second one, which was later taken up by Canada and by the USA.Werner Ehrlich, (1997) Point 3.b, p. 195 26 June: First debate on the Draft by ‚Äì sceptical ‚Äì like-minded Countries and selected NGO‚Äôs at a small Strategy meeting at the Quaker UN Office in Geneva.Stuart Maslen (2004) op. cit. Point 0.47, p.25 7 July: This Draft is circulated by the Quaker UN Office in Geneva to three like-minded Countries, Austria, Canada and Switzerland and to selected NGOs, to UNICEF and UNIDIR. 30 September: An improved second Draft of the Convention on a total ban on APM‚Äôs, taking into account numerous comments and suggestions received, is prepared by Dr. Ehrlich for the 1996 Ottawa Conference,.Stuart Maslen, op. cit. point 0.52, p 28 1 October: The Council of the European Union adopts ‚Äì after difficult negotiations ‚Äì a new \\"Common Action\\" on APM‚Äôs, which constitutes a big step forward as its Article 2 supports the early conclusion of an international Agreement on a total ban of APM‚Äôs.Werner Ehrlich (1997) Point 3.b, p- 195 This is a remarkable decision, as a number of EU-Members consider anti-personnel mines as military necessity, but this open support comes not without a mental reservation: As those negotiations were supposed to take place in the framework of the Conference on Disarmament, each Member would have the possibility to block them at any time. 3‚Äì5 October: The 1996 Ottawa Conference (The Ottawa International Strategy Conference). Due to the presence of Countries openly opposing a total ban in Ottawa, consensus was difficult to achieve. The political \\"Ottawa Declaration\\" was accepted only in the last moment, after protracted negotiations. The main document, the \\"Agenda for Action on Anti-Personnel (AP) Mines\\" failed to get consensus. Due to a compromise proposed by Austria it was finally accepted, but only as \\"paper of the Chairman\\".Werner Ehrlich (1996) op. cit. Point 4 b, p. 196) The purpose of the Conference was: \\" to catalyze practical efforts to move toward a ban and to create partnerships... essential to building the necessary political will to achieve a global ban on AP mines\\".Stuart Maslen (2004), op. cit. This purpose is defined in the second paragraph of the \\"Chairman‚Äôs Agenda for Action on Anti-Personnel Mines\\". Text in Appendix 3, page 361 The project of a Convention on a Total Ban of APM‚Äôs, advocated by the Austrian representative, Dr. Werner Ehrlich, was therefore low on the agenda and produced mainly negative reactions, including from likeminded countries, considering it to be premature,Werner Ehrlich, op. cit. p. 197 from the European Union ‚Äì which blocked the distribution of the prepared Draft at the Conference Stuart Maslen (2004), op. cit., Point 0.52 p. 28 and even from leading humanitarian organizations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), fearing waste of time and detraction from the priority of urgent practical measures.Werner Ehrlich (1996) op. cit. point 4 c, p. 197 The turning point was the announcement by the Austrian representative, that no time needs to be wasted as he had a complete Draft of such a Convention at his disposal Stuart Maslen, op. cit. Point 0.52, page 28 and his invitation, to start immediately a fast-track, free-standing negotiating process in Vienna ‚Äì outside the UN Conference on Disarmament (CD) ‚Äì notoriously blocked for many years by the lack of consensus.Werner Ehrlich, (1996) op. cit. S. 197 The Canadian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Lloyd Axworthy, instantly supported this proposal as a chance for a successful conclusion of the Conference and decided to task Austria to prepare the draft for these negotiations,Werner Ehrlich (1996) op. cit. point 4d, p. 198 suggesting that they should be concluded by the end of the year 1997 in Ottawa. This important decision is reflected in the text of the \\"Chairmen‚Äôs Agenda for Action on Anti-Personnel (AP) Mines\\" as follows: \\"To lay the necessary groundwork for a legally-binding international agreement to ban AP mines, Austria will produce a first draft and Canada will produce a possible framework for the verification of such an agreement\\".Stuart Maslen (2004): op. cit. Point 5 under Chapter A \\"Global Action\\" in the \\"Chairmen‚Äôs Agenda\\". Text in Appendix 3, p. 362 Minister Lloyd Axworthy started thereby the so-called \\"Ottawa Process\\", while countries opposed to a total ban were too shocked and too surprised to block this initiative.Stuart Maslen (2004): op. cit. point 0.49, and note 139, p. 26 November: A further enhanced third Draft of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention was prepared by Dr. Ehrlich and sent out worldwide. It was later known as the \\"First Austrian Draft\\" and was the basis for the forthcoming negotiations on this Convention.Stuart Maslen, op. cit. Point 0.52, p. 28. . Text in Appendix 4, p. 407-410Werner Ehrlich (1996) op. cit. p. 196, Text: on p. 201-205 10 December: The General Assembly of the United Nations adopts Resolution 51/45 S: \\"An International Agreement to Ban Anti-Personnel Land-Mines\\", which was supported by 115 co- sponsors. In its first operative paragraph States are urged:\\" to pursue vigorously an effective, legally binding international agreement to ban the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel landmines with a view to completing the negotiations as soon as possible\\".Stuart Maslen (2004), p. 29-30. The text of this resolution is in Appendix 2, p. 346-347 20 December: Draft of the ICBL: The International Campaign to Ban Landmines presents its own draft of a Convention on a total ban of APM‚Äôs. Much of its language would subsequently be reflected in the text of the Convention adopted. Belgian Draft: Belgium, one of the first supporters of a total ban treaty, also prepared a draft of such a treaty, which however appears to have had little direct influence on the later Austrian drafts.Stuart Maslen (2004), Point 0.55, p. 29. The text of the proposal of the ICBL is in Appendix 4, p. 398-404, the text of the Belgian draft follows on p. 404 1997 10 January: Austria adopts the first law on a comprehensive, permanent total ban of APM*s. It goes beyond the earlier Belgian law which was limited in its effect to 5 years and did not exclude stockpiling of APM‚Äôs allowing thereby the use of APM in case of emergency.Werner Ehrlich (1996) op. cit. p. 193, Text: Bundesgesetzblatt Nr. 13/1997 vom 10. J√§nner 1997 Threats to the comprehensive nature of the Convention: A major threat to the project of a Total ban Convention as endorsed by the 1996 Ottawa Conference was the danger of being watered down. One example was the well-intended attempt made by Canada to win the support of Countries opposed to a total ban ‚Äì in particular the USA ‚Äì by proposing a new approach: To replace the Draft Convention by a new text, composed of a \\"Chapeau-Convention\\", containing generalities only, and four annexed protocols, each one dealing with one of the main prohibitions: production, stockpiling, transfer and use of anti-personnel mines.Stuart Maslen (2004) Point 0.54, p. 29 This approach would allow some additional Countries to join the process but at the price of allowing them to pick and choose only those prohibitions compatible with their military needs. A concept, that would keep only the appearance of a total ban Treaty would risk creating a confusing situation of varying legal situations, and would, in the first place, postpone a real comprehensive total ban \\"ad calendas graecas\\". This proposal did however not materialise as the USA rebuffed the idea, believing that they could steer the negotiations into the Conference on Disarmament where it would be subject to the consensus rule. Attempts to block the project of a Total Ban Convention Countries opposing a total ban of APM‚Äôs because of their military necessities had an obvious interest to prevent any negotiations on a total ban and in particular in free standing negotiations as proposed by Austria. The smart way to achieve this aim was to insist on holding the relevant negotiations in the framework of the competent forum of the UN for disarmament negotiations, the Conference on Disarmament (CD). The catch is, that the CD had become since many years a dead end, because of fundamental disagreements among States Members on its agenda and because of the rule of consensus giving each member de facto the right of veto.Werner Ehrlich (1996) Point 4.b, p. 197 17 January: The White House declared that the USA will seek to initiate negotiations on a worldwide treaty banning the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel landmines in the framework of the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva. 30 January: In the CD the United Kingdom proposed the mandate for an ad hoc committee on a ban on APM‚Äôs, which however was not accepted. In the CD later Hungary and Japan made other, similarly unsuccessful, attempts in this direction Stuart Maslen (2004), p. 45, and note 223 on p. 45 12‚Äì14 February: The 1997 Vienna Conference (The Expert Meeting on the Text of a Convention to Ban Anti- Personnel Mines) was the first formal follow-up to the 1996 Ottawa Conference. It provided States with an initial opportunity to comment directly on the \\"First Austrian Draft\\" of the Convention. Representatives of 111 Governments attended this Conference. NGO‚Äôs were allowed to attend the plenary sessions, the UN and the ICRC were invited to participate even in the closed meetings. Only few governments spoke out against a total ban treaty Stuart Maslen (2004), op. cit. points 0.58/0.59 and note 170 p. 30-31 14 March: The \\"Second Austrian Draft\\" was completed, which, due to comments and suggestions received at the Vienna Conference, differed quite significantly from the first draft.Stuart Maslen, op. cit. points 0.62 and 0.63 p. 32/33 March: Other attempts to replace the \\"Ottawa Process\\" by negotiations in the framework of the Conference on Disarmament (CD) were undertaken by opponents of a total ban: Some EU Countries prompted the Netherlands to propose in the CD a draft mandate for negotiations on a total ban of APM‚Äôs. But this proposal was blocked by other EU States opposing an immediate ban.Stuart Maslen (2004), op. cit. Point 0.94, p.45/46. 27 March: At the CD Finland and Poland tabled a formal proposal to appoint a Special Coordinator for mine negotiations.Stuart Maslen (2004), p. 6, note 227 5‚Äì24 April: The 1997 Bonn Conference (FRG) (The International Expert Meeting on Possible Verification Measures to Ban Anti- Personnel Landmines in Bonn), was the second formal follow-up gathering to the 1996 Ottawa Conference and was attended by 121 governments. The German \\"Options Paper for a possible verification scheme for a convention to ban anti-personnel landmines\\" suggested significant and intrusive verification measures common in disarmament treaties. As opinions diverged, only some progress in this field was achieved. The spirit of the concept is reflected i. a. in the first paragraph of Article 8 of the Convention.Stuart Maslen, op. cit. points 0.64/0.65 p. 33/34 End of April: France, previously an ardent supporter of tackling the mine issue in the framework of the Conference on Disarmament (CD), realized that the free negotiating process was irreversible and joined the process as the first member of the Security Council of the UN Stuart Maslen, op. cit. point 0.68 on p.33 14 May: The \\"Third Austrian Draft\\" was issued. It included small changes from the previous Second Draft, e. g. regarding compliance issues, the question of duration and the possibility of withdrawal from the Convention.Text in Stuart Maslen (2004), op. cit., Point 0.67, p. 34; Text in Appendix 4 p. 416 -422 21 May: The United Kingdom ‚Äì previously supporting negotiations in the CD ‚Äì announced that it was joining the process as the second member of the UN Security Council. 24‚Äì27 June: The 1997 Brussels Conference (The Brussels International Conference for a Comprehensive Ban on Anti-Personnel Landmines) It provided a clear selection process for the forthcoming diplomatic conference in Oslo: It identified the Third Austrian Draft formally as the basis for its negotiations, agreed that a two-thirds majority was necessary for any substantive changes of this Draft,Stuart Maslen (2004) Point 0.81, p. 39 limited the voting right to States having adhered to the Brussels Declaration and allowed the ICBL to participate as a full observer, despite concerns from a number of States.Stuart Maslen (2004) Point 0.80, p. 38/39 The essential elements of the Convention were resumed in the \\"Brussels Declaration\\", signed by 97 of the 156 States attending the Conference.Stuart Maslen (2004) Points 0.76, p. 37, Text of the Declaration in Appendix 2, p 376-380 Even during the Brussels Conference new attempts were made to divert the negotiations on the Convention to the Conference on Disarmament: 26 June: In the CD an agreement was reached to appoint a Special Coordinator for APM‚Äôs tasked to try to find an agreed mandate that could form the basis for discussions.Stuart Maslen (2004), op. cit.Point 0.75, and note 190 on p. 37 and Point 0.95, on p.46 14 August: In the CD the special Coordinator for APM‚Äôs declared that there was little point in the CD taking any decisions on a possible mandate on APM‚Äôs until the outcome of the Ottawa Process was known in December 1997.Stuart Maslen (2004), op. cit.; point 0.95, p.46 This signaled the end of efforts to undercut the Ottawa Process in the CD. 18 August: The United States finally joined the Ottawa Process. The White House announced that the USA would be a full participant in the negotiations at the forthcoming Oslo Diplomatic Conference. But in a letter to key foreign ministers the US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, laid down five conditions for the USA‚Äôs possible signature of the treaty: * a geographical exception for the use of mines in South Korea; * a change of the definition of APM‚Äôs to allow the use of mixed anti-tank and anti-personnel \\"munitions\\" systems; * a transition period requiring, either through entry into force requiring 60 countries, including all five permanent members of the Security Council and at least 75 per cent of historic producers and users of APM‚Äôs, or an optional nine-year deferral period for compliance with certain provisions; * a strengthening of the verification regime; and * a clause permitting a party to withdraw when its superior national interests were threatened.Stuart Maslen (2004) op. cit. point 0.84, and note 198, p. 39/40 1‚Äì19 September: The 1997 Oslo Conference (The Oslo Diplomatic Conference on an International Total Ban on Anti-Personnel Land Mines). Its purpose, the final negotiation and formal adoption of the Treaty was achieved only after intensive debates on the conditions presented by the US and on numerous other new proposals on 18 September 1997, after the US delegation announced that it was withdrawing its proposals as it had been unable to garner the necessary support for them. The Convention was then formally adopted.Stuart Maslen (2004) op. cit. point 0.90, p. 43. Texts of the proposals in Appendix 5; p. 423-450 3‚Äì4 December: The 1997 Ottawa Conference (The Convention signing Conference and Mine Action Forum). In accordance with its Article 15, the Convention was opened for signature in Ottawa at a formal treaty signing conference. In total 150 governments attended the Conference and 121 signed the Convention at the Conference (Kenya (nr. 122) signed on 5 December).Stuart Maslen (2004), op. cit., point 0.91 and note 216 on p. 43 This achievement was described by the Canadian Prime Minister, Jean Chr√©tien, as \\"without precedent or parallel in either international disarmament or international humanitarian law.\\"Stuart Maslen (2004), op. cit., point 0.91 on p. 43 The final Conference Document, the 67-page \\"Program for Mine Action\\" detailed \\"pledges of more than 500 million $ to the mine effort over a five-year period.\\"Stuart Maslen (2004), op. cit., point 0.93 on p. 44. Text of the main part of the Final Document in Appendix 3, p. 388-395 5 December: The Convention is deposed in New York with the Secretary General of the United Nations, and opened for further signatures. 9 December: The General Assembly of the United Nations adopts by 142 votes Resolution 52/38 A \\"Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction\\", welcoming i. a. the conclusion of negotiations on 18 September of the Convention in Oslo, inviting \\"all States to sign the Convention‚Ä¶\\" (operative paragraph 1) and urging \\"all States to ratify the Convention without delay subsequent to their signatures\\" (operative paragraph 2) Stuart Maslen (2004), op. cit.; Text in Appendix 2; p. 348 Jody Williams and the ICBL are awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. 1998 The treaty reaches its 40th ratification, triggering its entry into force the next year. The ICBL launches the Landmine Monitor initiative to verify compliance with the treaty. 1999 The treaty becomes binding international law on 1 March 1999. 2003 The first stockpile destruction deadlines are met by all states parties with stockpiles. 2012 The ICBL marks its 20th anniversary. 2014 The United States under President Barack Obama mostly accepted the terms of the treaty by ceasing to acquire anti-personnel land mines and prohibiting their use outside of the Korean Peninsula. 2017 The ICBL marks its 25th anniversary. 2020 The United States under President Donald Trump mostly removed restrictions on the use of anti-personnel land mines, authorizing Combatant Commanders to employ \\"advanced, non-persistent landmines\\".  Implementation  = Treaty terms = Besides ceasing the production and development of anti-personnel mines, a party to the treaty must destroy its stockpile of anti-personnel mines within four years, although it may retain a small number for training purposes (mine- clearance, detection, etc.). Within ten years after ratifying the treaty, the country should have cleared all of its mined areas. This is a difficult task for many countries, but at the annual meetings of the States Parties they may request an extension and assistance. The treaty also calls on States Parties to provide assistance to mine-affected persons in their own country and to provide assistance to other countries in meeting their treaty obligations. The treaty covers only anti-personnel mines; it does not address mixed mines, anti-tank mines, remote-controlled claymore mines, anti-handling devices (booby traps), and other \\"static\\" explosive devices. = Destruction of stockpiles = Signatory nations have destroyed more than 48 million stockpiled mines since the treaty's entry into force on 1 March 1999. One hundred and fifty-nine (159) countries have completed the destruction of their stockpiles or declared that they did not possess stockpiles to destroy. =Retention of landmines= Article 3 of the treaty permits countries to retain landmines for use in training in mine detection, mine clearance, or mine destruction techniques. 72 countries have taken this option. Of this group, 26 States Parties retain fewer than 1,000 mines. Only two have retained more than 10,000 mines: Turkey (15,100) and Bangladesh (12,500). A total of 83 States Parties have declared that they do not retain any antipersonnel mines, including 27 states that stockpiled antipersonnel mines in the past.Landmine Monitor Report 2012, p. 8. Canada also retains mines for training. They also continue to make and use the \\"C19 Detonated Weapon\\" in combat, this does not qualify as a landmine under the treaty because it is fired by a person and not by a pressure plate.http://www.defense-aerospace.com/article- view/release/8687/canadian-policy-on-anti_personnel-mines-(feb.-15).html = Landmine-free countries = Through 2015, 29 countries had cleared all known mined areas from their territory: Albania, Bhutan, Bulgaria, Burundi, Republic of the Congo, Costa Rica, Denmark, Djibouti, France, Gambia, Germany, Guinea- Bissau, Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Jordan, Malawi, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Rwanda, Suriname, Swaziland, Tunisia, Uganda, and Venezuela. El Salvador finished clearing its landmines before joining the Treaty. At the November‚ÄìDecember 2009 Cartagena Summit for a Mine- Free World, Albania, Greece, Rwanda, and Zambia were also declared mine-free. On 2 December 2009, Rwanda was declared free of landmines. It followed a three-year campaign by 180 Rwandan soldiers, supervised by the Mine Awareness Trust and trained in Kenya, to remove over 9,000 mines laid in the country between 1990 and 1994. The soldiers checked and cleared 1.3 square km of land in twenty minefields. The official Cartagena Summit announcement came after the Rwandan Ministry of Defence's own announcement of the completion of the demining process on 29 November 2009. Under Article 5 of the Ottawa Treaty, Rwanda was requested to become mine-free by 1 December 2010. On 18 June 2010, Nicaragua was declared free of landmines. Two more countries became free of landmines in 2011. On 14 June 2011, Nepal was declared a landmine-free zone, making it the second country (after China) to be landmine-free in Asia. In December 2011, Burundi was declared landmine free. On 5 December 2012 at the 12th Meeting of the States Parties, six states declared themselves landmine- free. These were the Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Jordan, and Uganda. On 17 September 2015, Mozambique was declared free of land mines after the last of some nearly 171,000 had been cleared over 20 years.  Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor  The Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor (\\"the Monitor\\") is an initiative providing research for the ICBL and the Cluster Munition Coalition (CMC), and acting as their de facto monitoring regime. As an initiative of ICBL which was founded in 1998 through Human Rights Watch, the Monitor gives monitoring on the humanitarian development and uses of landmines, cluster munitions, and explosive remnants of war (ERW). It provides reports on all aspects of the landmine, cluster munitions, and ERW issues. It issues annual report updates on all countries in the world, keeps an international network with experts, provides research findings for all mediums, and remains flexible to adapt its reports to any changes. The Monitor has earned respect with its transparency whose states must be provided under the relevant treaties for independent reporting. Its main audiences are not only governments, NGOs, and other international organizations, but also media, academics and the public.  States Parties  The Convention gained 122 country signatures when it opened for signing on 3 December 1997 in Ottawa, Canada. Currently, there are 164 States Parties to the Treaty.Treaty Status , International Campaign to Ban Landmines Thirty-three countries have not signed the treaty and one more has signed but did not ratify. The states that have not signed the treaty includes a majority of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council: China, the United States, and Russia. In 2014, the United States declared that it will abide by the terms of the Treaty, except for landmines used on the Korean Peninsula. South Korea, like North Korea, has not signed the treaty, believing the use of landmines to be crucial to the defense of their territory against the other.  Criticism  Criticism from academics, security officials, and diplomats is based on both the political process and the substance. The campaign for what became the Ottawa Treaty was led by a group of powerful non-governmental organizations, and instead of working within existing multilateral frameworks, including the Conference on Disarmament, based at the UN compound in Geneva (the Palais des Nations), an ad hoc framework was created that detoured around existing intergovernmental processes. Critics alleged that this represented a challenge to the sovereignty and responsibility of nation states for the defense of their citizens. Substantively, critics view the treaty as naive and idealistic, in attempting to erase the reality of security threats that lead armies and defense forces to rely on landmines for protection against invasion and terror attacks. As a result, ratification has been far from universal, and many of the states that do not currently intend to ratify the treaty possess large stockpiles of anti-personnel mines. So far 35 countries have not signed the treaty; nonsignatories include the United States, Russia, China, Myanmar, United Arab Emirates, Cuba, Egypt, India, Israel, and Iran. In Finland, the National Coalition Party and the Finns Party proposed withdrawing from the treaty. The stance is supported by the Finnish Ministry of Defence report from 2003, which sees landmines as an effective weapon against a mechanised invasion force. Recently, in early 2018, an MP from the National Coalition Party started a citizens' initiative to withdraw from the Ottawa Treaty. Also, the Minister of Defence Jussi Niinist√∂ (Blue Reform; formerly Finns Party prior to its split) has been supporting withdrawal from the treaty, saying that he \\"wants to rip it in half\\". Ukraine has also signaled that they might have to withdraw from the treaty due to military necessity. Opponents of banning anti-personnel mines give several reasons, among them that mines are a cheap and therefore cost-effective area denial weapon. Opponents claim that when used correctly, anti-personnel mines are defensive weapons that harm only attackers, unlike ranged weapons such as ballistic missiles that are most effective if used for preemptive attacks. Furthermore, opponents claim that the psychological effect of mines increases the threshold to attack and thus reduces the risk of war. The Ottawa Treaty does not cover all types of unexploded ordnance. Cluster bombs, for example, introduce the same problem as mines: unexploded bomblets can remain a hazard for civilians long after a conflict has ended. A separate Convention on Cluster Munitions was drafted in 2008 and was adopted and entered into force in 2010. As of February 2020, there are 108 state parties of the CCM. In theory, mines could be replaced by manually triggered Claymore mines, but this requires the posting of a sentry, which makes it much more expensive than using other indiscriminate weapons such as cluster bombs or artillery bombardment. Opponents point out that the Ottawa Convention places no restriction whatsoever on anti-vehicle mines which kill civilians on tractors, on school buses, etc. The position of the United States is that the inhumane nature of landmines stems not from whether they are anti-personnel as opposed to antivehicle but from their persistence. The United States has unilaterally committed to never using persistent landmines of any kind, whether anti-personnel or anti-vehicle, which they say is a more comprehensive humanitarian measure than the Ottawa Convention. All US landmines now self-destruct in two days or less, in most cases four hours. While the self-destruct mechanism has never failed in more than 65,000 random tests, if self-destruct were to fail the mine will self-deactivate because its battery will run down in two weeks or less. That compares with persistent anti-vehicle mines which remain lethal for about 30 years and are legal under the Ottawa Convention. Little progress in actual reduction of mine usage has been achieved. In 2011, the number of landmines dispersed is higher than ever since 2004, landmines being dispersed in Libya, Syria, and Myanmar. Turkey reported that between 1957 and 1998, Turkish forces laid 615,419 antipersonnel mines along the Syrian border \\"to prevent illegal border crossings\\". These mines are killing Syrians stuck on the border or trying to cross near Koban√Æ. Turkey is required under the treaty to destroy all antipersonnel mines, but has missed deadlines. Human Rights Watch claims in its report that as of 18 November 2014, over 2,000 civilians were still in the Tel Shair corridor section of the mine belt because Turkey had been refusing entry for cars or livestock, and the refugees did not want to leave behind their belongings.

UNGA Resolution 66/29, for example, was adopted on 2 December 2011 by a vote of 162 in favor, none opposed, and 18 abstentions. Since the first UNGA resolution supporting the Mine Ban Treaty in 1997, the number of states voting in favor has ranged from a low of 139 in 1999 to a high of 165 in 2010. The number of states abstaining has ranged from a high of 23 in 2002 and 2003 to a low of 17 in 2005 and 2006. Of the 19 states not party that voted in support of Resolution 66/29 on 2 December 2011, nine have voted in favor of every Mine Ban Treaty resolution since 1997 (Armenia, Bahrain, Finland, Georgia, Oman, Poland, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and the United Arab Emirates); 10 that consistently abstained or were absent previously now vote in favor (Azerbaijan, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lao PDR, Marshall Islands, Micronesia FS, Mongolia, Morocco, and Tonga). Somalia, now a State Party, was absent from the 2011 resolution, but has voted in favor in previous years.Landmine Monitor Report 2012, p. 12. The number of states abstaining from supporting the resolution has ranged from a high of 23 in 2002 and 2003 to a low of 17 in 2010, 2005 and 2006. The group of states that could be described as most concerned about the security implications of the Mine Ban Treaty are the 15 states not party that have voted against consecutive resolutions since 1997: Cuba, Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, Libya (since 1998), Myanmar, North Korea (since 2007), Pakistan, Russia, South Korea, Syria, Uzbekistan (since 1999), the United States, and Vietnam (since 1998).  Key figures in the making of the Ottawa Treaty/Mine Ban Treaty  = Letter- writers and non-governmental organizations = The Ottawa Anti-Personnel Mines Treaty would not likely have been possible without the sustained effort of thousands of global citizens writing their elected officials in the lead up to the treaty's creation and signing in 1997. A small number of core groups mobilized on the landmines problem worked closely with a wider variety of NGOs, including churches, prominent children's and women's rights groups, disarmament and development groups, in order to produce concerted political pressure, as well as with the media to keep the issue in the forefront. Because of this unparalleled involvement of the global public, and their success in lobbying for this initiative, university political science and law departments frequently study the socio-historical initiatives that led to the Ottawa process, arguing it is a leading modern example of the power of peaceful democratic expression and a method for mobilization on disarmament issues or more broadly. =Jody Williams and The International Campaign to Ban Landmines= The organization the International Campaign to Ban Landmines and its founding coordinator, Jody Williams, were instrumental in the passage of the Ottawa Treaty, and for these efforts they jointly received the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize. However, since efforts to secure the treaty started over a decade before Williams involvement and the fact that the treaty was a joint effort of so many people from all over the world, including hundreds of influential political and private leaders, some felt that Williams should decline to personally benefit from the award of the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize. Williams herself has said she feels the organization deserved the award while she did not, and emphasized the collective nature of the movement; as the chair of a group of female Peace Prize recipients, she has used her status as a Peace Prize recipient to bring concerns of woman-led grassroots organizations to the attention of governments.The Life Of An Activist =Werner Ehrlich= Available sources such as the excellent study on the Ottawa Treaty made by Stuart Maslen Stuart Maslen: The Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction. In: Oxford Commentaries on International Law, Commentaries on Arms Control Treaties, Volume 1, Oxford University Press, 2004; ; and an article published by Werner Ehrlich in 1996 Werner Ehrlich, Auf dem Weg zu einer Konvention √ºber das Verbot von Anti-Personen-Minen; √ñsterreichisches Jahrbuch f√ºr internationale Politik; √ñsterreichische Gesellschaft f√ºr Au√üenpolitik und internationale Beziehungen gemeinsam mit dem √ñsterreichischen Institut f√ºr internationale Politik; Verlag B√∂hlau, 1996; indicate that the key figure in the making of the Ottawa Treaty was the Austrian diplomat Dr. Werner Ehrlich, head of the Disarmament Unit at the Austrian Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 1995/96: He initiated the process by making the first draft of the future Treaty in April 1996 and succeeded to get this project and the proposed unorthodox procedure ‚Äì to negotiate this Convention outside the Conference on Disarmament (CD) ‚Äì adopted by the Ottawa Conference in October 1996 ‚Äì in spite of nearly universal opposition. It was an uphill struggle. This proposal was understandably rejected by countries which see anti- personnel mines as essential for national defense. Consequently, they tried repeatedly to block the project or to steer it to a dead end in the CD. The proposal was however also opposed by Countries and NGO‚Äôs supporting a total ban, because of their conviction that practical measures would be more conducive to a total ban than a Convention, A view which was reflected in the \\"purpose\\" of the 1996 Ottawa Conference: \\"to catalyze practical efforts to move toward a ban and to create partnerships essential to building the necessary political will to achieve a global ban on AP mines.\\" But this meant in fact, that a total ban was postponed to a remote future: until practical efforts may have convinced one day Countries depending on APM‚Äôs for their defense, that APM‚Äôs are useless or counterproductive. The approach of Werner Ehrlich was different: It was essential to delegitimize as soon as possible any use of APM‚Äôs by the adoption of an instrument of international law on a total ban of APM‚Äôs, because it would not only bind the Parties to the Convention but would also have at least a moral effect on Countries not Parties by clearly contradicting the idea that the use of APM‚Äôs is legal. It was also essential to elaborate this Treaty in a free standing negotiating process outside the Conference on Disarmament (CD), as there mine-affected Countries not Members of the CD would be excluded and opponents of a total ban could block the project immediately, e. g. simply by denying consensus to put it on the agenda.Werner Ehrlich, (1997) Point 4b, p. 197 At the Ottawa Conference in October 1996 Dr. Ehrlich defended the project of a Total Ban Convention, against opponents of a total ban as well as even against leading humanitarian organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), which at the beginning saw the project as premature, as detraction or even as a waste of time.Werner Ehrlich (1976) Point 4c, p. 197 He succeeded finally against all odds ‚Äì due in particular to the inspired and timely support of the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lloyd Axworthy ‚Äì to get his project indorsed by the Conference: Austria was tasked to draft the text for the negotiations which were to be held ‚Äì as proposed ‚Äì in a free standing negotiating process, a procedure later called the \\"Ottawa Process\\". His third and final draft before leaving disarmament at the end of 1996 to become Austria‚Äôs Ambassador to the Islamic Republic of Iran Stuart Maslen, (2004) op. cit. point 0.53, p. 28 was known as the \\"First Austrian Draft\\" and served as the basis for the following negotiations leading to the adoption of the Mine Ban Treaty in December 1997 = Canada's Mine Action = Mines Action Canada grew out of the efforts of Canadian non-governmental agencies concerned about the rapidly spreading impact of landmines and cluster munitions. The group was successful in garnering positive Canadian government attention to the call for a ban by mobilizing Canadians to demand action. By 1996, sustained and growing citizen action led Minister Axworthy of the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade to collaborate with Mines Action Canada and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. This in turn led to the Government of Canada challenging other countries to negotiate and sign a treaty banning ban landmines within one year. This call to action led directly to the signing of the \\"Convention on the Prohibition on the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction\\" commonly known as the 'mine ban treaty' one year later in December 1997. Mines Action Canada was hosted by Physicians for Global Survival, chaired by Valerie Warmington and coordinated by Celina Tuttle from the coalition's inception until after the treaty was signed. = Diana, Princess of Wales = Once in the final stages leading into the treaty, the Ottawa Treaty was ardently championed by Diana, Princess of Wales. In January 1997, she visited Angola and walked near a minefield to dramatize its dangers. In January 1997, Angola's population was approximately 10 million and had about 10‚Äì20 million land mines in place from its civil war. In August 1997, she visited Bosnia with the Landmine Survivors Network. Her work with landmines focused on the injuries and deaths inflicted on children. When the Second Reading of the Landmines Bill took place in 1998 in the British House of Commons, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook praised Diana and paid tribute to her work on landmines. = Lloyd Axworthy = In his Canadian Foreign Affairs portfolio (1996‚Äì2000), Lloyd Axworthy became internationally known (and criticized in some quarters) for his advancement of the concept of human security and including the Ottawa Treaty, and the creation of the International Criminal Court. =Bobby Muller= Robert O. (Bobby) Muller (born 1946) is an American peace advocate. He participated in the Vietnam War as a young soldier, and after returning from Vietnam, Muller began to work for veterans' rights and became a peace activist. Since then, Muller founded Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA) in 1978 and Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation (VVAF) in 1980. The VVAF co-founded the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, which won a 1997 Nobel Peace Prize.

Francis Smith (October 21, 1808 ‚Äì November 16, 1895) was an American Baptist minister, journalist, and author. He is best known for having written the lyrics to \\"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\\" (sung to the tune of \\"God Save The Queen\\"), which he entitled \\"America\\". Early life and education Smith was born in Boston, Massachusetts on October 21, 1808. Smith attended Harvard College (now Harvard University) from 1825 to 1829, and was a classmate of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. From 1829 to 1834, he attended Andover Theological Seminary. =America (My Country, 'Tis of Thee)= The Express212x212px While a student at Andover Theological Seminary, Smith gave Lowell Mason lyrics he had written and the song was first performed in public on July 4, 1831, at a children's Independence Day celebration at Park Street Church in Boston.Garraty, John A., and Carnes, Mark C., editors, American National Biography, volume 20, New York: Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 281 The song, titled \\"America\\", was first published by Lowell Mason in The Choir in 1832. Smith later wrote an additional stanza for the April 30, 1889 Washington Centennial Celebration.  Ministry  In 1834, Smith worked in Boston editing the Baptist Missionary Magazine before going to Maine. His ordination as a Baptist minister was on February 12, 1834, in Waterville, Maine, where in addition to his ministry, he served as Professor of Modern Languages at Waterville College. In 1842, he left Waterville to go to Newton, Massachusetts. Smith did not stop writing. In addition to \\"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\\", Smith wrote over 150 other hymns. In 1843, he teamed with Baron Stow to compile a Baptist hymnal, The Psalmist.Garraty, John A., and Carnes, Mark C., editors, American National Biography, volume 20, New York: Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 282July 4: Samuel Francis Smith's \\"America\\"; Christian History Institute In Newton, Smith became editor of the Christian Review and other publications of the Baptist Missionary Union. He continued his ministry as well, becoming pastor of the First Baptist Church in Newton in the village of Newton Centre. In Newton, Smith bought a house at 1181 Centre Street. After twelve years as pastor of the Newton Centre church, he became editorial secretary of the BMU and served there for fifteen years. From1875 to 1880, he made many trips to Europe, Turkey, India, Ceylon and Burma to visit missionary outposts. He wrote a history of his adoptive home, entitled History of Newton, Massachusetts, which was published in 1880. Professor and author Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. recommended Smith as a potential candidate for an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Harvard University in 1893. Harvard president Charles William Eliot declined, noting that My Country 'Tis of Thee was better known for its tune, which Smith did not write, rather than its lyrics. Holmes disagreed, noting that \\"his song will be sung centuries from now, when most of us and our pipings are forgotten.\\"Small, Miriam Rossiter. Oliver Wendell Homes. New York: Twayne Publishers, Inc., 1962: 75.  Personal life  On September 16, 1834, Smith married Mary White Smith, whose maiden name was Smith. They had six children. Smith was foster father for four years to teenager Thornton Chase, who, instead of entering college, left to become an officer in the Civil War. Chase later converted to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith and was a leading member in the United States.

Smith He was buried in Newton Cemetery. \\"America\\" was among the pieces sung at his funeral. He was survived by his wife and five children. Legacy Smith was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970. The home Smith lived in in Andover is now a Phillips Academy dormitory named America House. The home in which Smith and his family lived in Newton is no longer standing. In 1958, a society was formed to buy and preserve it, but the home was damaged by fire in 1968 and again in 1969, leading to its destruction. A small monument and growing garden honors his legacy.

Ceredigion County Council offices are based in Aberaeron. The name of the town is Welsh, translating to mouth of the Aeron, derived from the Middle Welsh ', \\"slaughter\\", which gave its name to Aeron, who is believed to have been a Welsh god of war.p.144 A Wander Around the Coast of Wales by Steve Plant, FastPrint Publishing, 2014 The population was 1,520 in 2001, reducing to 1,422 at the 2011 census. History and design In 1800, there was no significant coastal settlement.Aberaeron at Ceredigion County Council website The present town was planned and developed from 1805 by the Rev. Alban Thomas Jones Gwynne. He built a harbour which operated as a port and supported a shipbuilding industry in the 19th century. A group of workmen's houses and a school were built on the harbour's north side, but these were reclaimed by the sea.Aberaeron 1807‚Äì2007: Aberaeron Town Trail, celebrating our heritage Heritage Treftadaeth, 2007 (under building 1 - General Storehouse) Steam ships continued to visit the harbour until the 1920s but, in later years, it evolved into a small half-tide harbour for recreational craft. The estuary is also crossed by a wooden pedestrian bridge. Crafts were an important part of village life. Information recorded in trade directories shows that in 1830, although it was not yet fully developed as a port, there were in Aberaeron one woollen manufacturer, one bootmaker, one baker, one corn miller, one blacksmith, one blacksmith and shovel maker, two shipwrights, one carpenter and one hat maker.Jenkins, J. Geraint. Ceredigion: Interpreting an Ancient County. Gwasg Careg Gwalch (2005) pg. 83. In the late 1890s, a hand-powered cable car, the Aeron Express, was built to ferry workers across the harbour when the bridge was demolished by floods. The structure was recreated in 1988 as a tourist attraction that ran until the end of summer 1994, when it was closed under health and safety regulations.Price M. R. C. \\"The Lampeter, Aberayron and New Quay Light Railway\\", Oakwood Press 2011, p.104 The architecture of Aberaeron is unusual in this part of rural Wales, being constructed around a principal square of elegant Regency style buildings grouped around the harbour. This was the work of Edward Haycock, an architect from Shrewsbury. Some of the architecture was of sufficient interest to feature on British postage stamps. Aberaeron Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1923. It continued until World War II when the course was turned over to agriculture to aid the war effort. Post-war attempts to reinstate the club failed.‚ÄúAberaeron Golf Club‚Äù, ‚ÄúGolf‚Äôs Missing Links‚Äù.  , a 12th- century ringwork fortification around a probable wooden structure was located by the shore at Aberaeron, but has long since been claimed by the sea. Few traces remain today apart from some mounds of earth, the remains of the enclosure bank, most of the site having been eroded. In Wales Illustrated in a Series of Views by Henry Gastineau, published in 1810, it states: \\"Near the town are some remains of an ancient fortress called Castell Cadwgan, thought to have been erected by King Cadwgan, about the year 1148.\\" However, Cadwgan is recorded as having been killed in 1111. Welsh Minstrelsy: Containing the Land Beneath the Sea, published in 1824, states: \\"Just where Sarn Ddewi juts out from the shore is an old fort, called Castell Cadwgan.\\" Local government Ceredigion County Council offices in Aberaeron Aberaeron is a relatively new settlement and lacked borough status like other towns in the county. In 1894, the town achieved the status of being an urban district until the local government reorganisation of 1974. The first representative for Aberayron on the Cardiganshire County Council from 1889 was John Morgan Howell, who became a prominent figure in the political life of the county. Following his election in January 1889, bonfires were lit to celebrate his victory. Since 1995 the Aberaeron ward has elected one councillor to Ceredigion County Council. Since 2008 the ward has been represented by Councillor Elizabeth Evans for the Welsh Liberal Democrats. Location and features Aberaeron is located between Cardigan and Aberystwyth on the A487, at a junction with the A482 leading south-east to the university town of Lampeter. It lies on the Ceredigion Coast Path, part of the Wales Coast Path. The shoreline consists of generally steep storm beaches of pebbles, although fine sand is visible at low tide levels. Aberaeron south beach was awarded the Blue Flag rural beach award in 2005.Blue Flag website It contains the Harbourmaster Hotel. The climate is mild and temperate, largely conditioned by the proximity of the relatively shallow sea. However, Aberaeron can suffer from occasional winter frosts when cold air descends the Aeron valley from the upland parts of Ceredigion. The town is notable for the sale of honey and honey by-products. 70% of Aberaeron's inhabitants are able to speak Welsh, according to the 2001 census.

There it was used to make everything from table wine to liqueurs to Sherry-like fortified wine. Prior to President Gorbachev's vine pull scheme, it was possibly the world's most widely planted white wine grape.winepros.com.au. In Kakheti it was particularly known for its sweet dessert wines fashioned in the same manner as port wine. There were many attempts to create a sparkling wine from the grape but its naturally high alcohol levels prevented it from being much of a success. Wine regions The grape is mostly planted in its ancestral home of Georgia though there are still sizable plantings in other Eastern European countries like Russia, Bulgaria, Moldova, Romania, North Macedonia, Azerbaijan and Ukraine. =Other regions= It is also planted, in small amounts, in Australia and the eastern United States, mainly in the Finger Lakes region of New York state, Massachusetts, New Jersey and in Virginia and North Carolina .Wine 101 - Rkatsiteli WineCompass There have also been some experimental plantings in California, the Grand Valley AVA and West Elks AVA of Colorado and China (where the grape is known as Baiyu). Viticulture The high acidity of the grape is prone to make the wines excessively tart so winemakers try to pick the grapes as late as possible in order to maximize the sugar balance to offset the acidity. In most regions of Eastern Europe harvest is typically in mid October. Wine style Rkatsiteli makes noticeably acidic, balanced white wine with spicy and floral notes in the aroma.

Two shipwrecks within Apra Harbor Apra Harbor, also called Port Apra, is a deep-water port on the western side of the United States territory of Guam. The harbor is formed by Orote Peninsula in the south and Cabras Island in the north. To the south, the harbor narrows and then widens again to form an inner harbor. The southern end of the harbor is the location of Naval Base Guam. The northern end is the commercial port, which handles about 2 million tons of cargo a year. It is considered one of the best natural ports in the Pacific and attracts many tourists. Past and future use Apra comes from the Chamorro word apapa 'low.' Apapa is the original name for what is now Cabras Island. During Spanish rule, a saint's name was added and the area became known as the port of San Luis de Apra. Apra Harbor was home to rich fishing grounds. It took the ports of Umatac and Central Hagatna's place during the 19th century when the ports of Piti and Sumay opened which was put into more frequent use. Piti was the main port for Hagatna while Summay was used for a rest stop for whalers. As many as 60 whaling ships came through the harbor per year. While Hagatna was the capital of Guam, Summay became the commercial and financial center of the island. During the whaling period, Apra was considered to be one of the best ports in the Pacific. As the whaling era came to an end Guam's economy was in decline. Guam's economy started to improve when Spain's reign came to an end. U.S. naval Captain Henry Glass claimed Guam as part of the U.S. on June 20, 1898. Guam connected with the rest of the world in 1903 when it became the site of telegraph cable stations. Since 1898, ships that burned coal, and later petroleum products, used Guam's ports, mainly Apra. From 1941 to 1944 during World War II Apra Harbor was under Japanese control and was fully used for repair and refueling of their submarines and warships. The liberation of Guam in 1944 caused huge amounts of damage to the coastal environment. Navy News noted that over 7,000 tons of explosives had been used that previous year to clear ship passages in Guam. of these explosives is enough to destroy a volume of coral deep. The Glass Breakwater and inner Apra Harbor were built to support the US military after World War II. Apra Harbor served military, civilian shipping needs, and included facilities for repair, supply, and fuel transfer for ships and nuclear submarines. The harbor has also been used for nuclear and conventional weapon transfer, fishing, recreation, and tourism. Today most of Apra Harbor is controlled by the U.S. Navy, but some ports remain public such as Sasa Bay, the Piti Channel and parts of Glass Breakwater. The land where the commercial port was located was transferred to Guam's government in 1969. Apra Harbor today is more than an important port to Guam. It is also a popular recreation area for personal watercraft users, boaters, and surfers. Apra Harbor is home to shipwrecks that are popular with scuba divers. The most well known wrecks are the World War I-era German merchant ship, , and the World War II-era Japanese freighter, Tokai Maru which lie side by side on the ocean floor. Military realignment and the expansion of Apra Harbor Harbor security Forces escort the through Apra Harbor in December 2019 In 2006 the U.S. Japan \\"Roadmap for Realignment Implementation Agreement\\" agreed that over 8,600 U.S. Marines currently based in Okinawa, Japan would relocate to the U.S. territory of Guam and the Marianas Islands. This reorientation could be one of the largest peacetime military relocations in U.S. history. The details of the military move are evolving, and much is on hold due to budget sequestration. The U.S. Navy has suggested the need for expansion of Apra Harbor, which is the largest deep water port in the Western Pacific and the busiest in Micronesia to allow the basing of additional ships in Guam as part of the Navy's shift to the Pacific.

It is located in the northern highlands of Peru at approximately 2,750 m (8,900 ft) above sea level in the valley of the Mashcon river. Cajamarca had an estimated population of about 226,031 inhabitants in 2015, making it the 13th largest city in Peru. Cajamarca has a mild highland climate, and the area has a very fertile soil. The city is well known for its dairy products and mining activity in the surroundings. Among its tourist attractions, Cajamarca has numerous examples of Spanish colonial religious architecture, beautiful landscapes, pre-Hispanic archeological sites and hot springs at the nearby town of Ba√±os del Inca (Baths of the Inca). The history of the city is highlighted by the Battle of Cajamarca, which marked the defeat of the Inca Empire by Spanish invaders as the Incan emperor Atahualpa was captured and murdered here.  Etymology  The etymology of the Quechua language name Kasha Marka (Cajamarca dialect), sometimes spelled Cashamarka or Qasamarka is uncertain. It may mean 'town of thorns'. Another theory suggests that it is a hybrid name that combines a Quechua kasha 'cold' and the Quechua marca 'place'. All sources agree that the word has Quechua origin. History The city and its surroundings have been occupied by several cultures for more than 2000 years. Traces of pre-Chav√≠n cultures can be seen in nearby archaeological sites, such as Cumbe Mayo and Kuntur Wasi. Huacaloma is an archaeological site located 3.5 km southeast of the historic center of the city of Cajamarca (currently in the middle of the Metropolitan Area of Cajamarca). Its antiquity is calculated between 1500 and 1000 BC, that is to say, it belongs to the Andean Formative Period. It presents enclosures with bonfires, similar to those of La Galgada and Kotosh, but with simpler design. It was a ceremonial center where fire rituals were performed. In 1986 the Organization of American States designated Cajamarca as a site of Historical and Cultural Heritage of the Americas. (Ag/Res. 810 (XVI-0/86)) =Pre-Columbian Cajamarca= The Cajamarca culture began flourishing as a culture during the first millennium AD The unbroken stylistic continuity (i.e., autonomy) of Cajamarca art from its inception around 200-100 BC up to the Spanish conquest is remarkable, given the presence of powerful neighbors and the series of imperial expansions that reached this area. It is known essentially only from its fine ceramics made with locally abundant white kaolin paste fired at high temperatures (over 1,000 ¬∞C). Cajamarca culture pottery has long been recognized as a prestige ware, given its distinctiveness and wide, if sporadic, distribution. Initial Cajamarca ceramics (200 BC to AD 200) are largely confined to the Cajamarca Basin. Early Cajamarca ceramics (AD 200‚Äì450) have more complex and diverse decorations and extensive distribution. They are found in much of the North Highlands as well as in yunka zones on both the Amazonian and Pacific sides of the Andes. In fact, at least one Early Cajamarca high-prestige burial has been documented at the Moche site of San Jose de Moro (lower Jequetepeque), and a set of imported kaolin spoons has been found at the site of Moche, the city capital of the Southern Moche polity. Cajamarca ceramics achieved their greatest prestige and widest distribution during Middle Cajamarca subphase B (700-900), coinciding with Moche demise and dominance of the Wari empire in Peru. Middle Cajamarca prestige ceramics have been found at a great deal of Wari sites, as far as southern-frontier Wari sites such as the city of Pikillacta located in Cusco region. Moreover, the construction of the north coastal settlement of Cerro Chepen, a massive terraced mountain city-fortress in Moche territory is attributed to an apparent joint effort between Wari and Cajamarca polities to ruler over this area of Peru. In 2004 a large building erected in Cerro Chepen mountain was excavated, said structure follows high-altitude Andean architectural models, which is tentatively interpreted as an elite residential structure. Excavations have shown an unexpected association between Late Moche domestic ceramics and fine ceramics from the Cajamarca mountains inside the patios, galleries and rooms that make up the structure. The evidence recovered in this building suggests the presence of highland officials in the heart of the Cerro Chepen Monumental Sector. However, the rise of the Middle Sican state on the north coast around 900-1000 saw a notable reduction in the distribution of Late Cajamarca ceramics back to the extent seen during Moche Phase IV. Analysis of settlement patterns in the Cajamarca Valley shows a significant reduction in the number of settlements during the Late Cajamarca phase (AD 850‚Äì1200). Scholars interpret this reduction in the number of settlements as the result of population reduction and/or dispersion, probably linked to the end of Wari influence in the region and the collapse of the EIP/MH regional polity organized around the center of Coyor in the Cajamarca Valley. With the collapse of Wari influence in the Cajamarca region the number of settlements first dropped, but then gradually increased by the Final Cajamarca phase (1250‚Äì1532). Cajamarca maintained its prestige, as shown by the influence its ceramics still had on the coast. During the Final Cajamarca phase settlements like Guzmango Viejo or Tantarica in the western slopes of the cordillera to the coast, as well as Santa Delia in the Cajamarca Valley became particularly large (> 20ha). These centers have a larger number of clearly distinguishable elite residential units as well as a greater number of fine ceramics than any earlier sites. It is clear that they are top ranked settlements in the region. At least the centers of the upper sections of the coastal valleys to the west probably benefited from their strategic location in relation first to Sican and later to Chimu. Scholars interpret the changes of the Final Cajamarca phase as evidence of a renewed prosperity and integration of the region. =15th century - Inca Empire and Cuismancu Kingdom= During the period between 1463 and 1471, Ccapac Yupanqui and his nephew Tupac Inca Yupanqui, both Apuskispay-kuna or Inca generals, conquered the city of Cajamarca and brought it into the Tawantinsuyu or Inca Empire, at the time it was ruled by Tupac Inca Yupanqui's father, Pachacutiq. Nevertheless, the city of Kasha Marka had already been founded by other ethnic groups almost a century before its incorporation to the Inca empire, approximately in the year 1320. Although Ccapac Yupanqui conquered the city of Cajamarca, the supply line was poorly made and controlled, as he traveled hastily to Cajamarca without building or conquering on much of the journey from central Peru, Ccapac Yupanqui believed Inca army's supply line of troops and supplies wasn't optimal and thus put at risk the Inca control over the newly acquired city of Cajamarca. Ccapac Yupanqui left part of his troops garrisoned at Cajamarca, and then he returned to Tawantinsuyu in order to ask for reinforcements and conducted a more extensive campaign in the territories of central Peru, building a great quantity of infrastructure (such as tambos, colcas, pukaras, etc.) along the Inca road. Incas remodeled Cajamarca following Inca canons of architecture, however, not much of it has survived since the Spanish did the same after conquering Cajamarca. Colonial accounts tell of Cuismancu Kingdom, the historical counterpart of the Final Cajamarca archaeological culture. According to the chroniclers, Cuismanco, Guzmango or Kuismanku (modern Quechua spelling) was the political entity that ruled the Cajamarca area before the arrival of the Incas and was incorporated into the Inca dominion. The kingdom or domain of Cuismanco belongs to the last phase of the Cajamarca Tradition and of all the nations of the northern mountains of Peru it was the one to achieve the highest social, political and cultural development. Oral tradition records their title, Guzmango Capac ‚Äì Guzmango being the name of the ethnic group or polity, while Capac signified a divine ruler whose forefathers displayed a special force, energy, and wisdom in ruling. By the time the Spaniards began to ask about their history, the polity's residents (called Cajamarquinos today) could remember the names of only two brothers who had served as Guzmango Capac under the Incas. The first was called Concacax, who was followed by Cosatongo. After Concacax died, his son, Chuptongo, was sent south to serve the emperor, Tupac Inca Yupanqui. There he received an education at court and, as a young adult, became the tutor of one of Inca Yupanqui's sons, Guayna Capac. Oral history records that \\"he gained great fame and reputation in all the kingdom for his quality and admirable customs\\". It was also said that Guayna Capac respected Chuptongo as he would a father. Eventually, Tupac Inca Yupanqui named Chuptongo a governor of the empire. When Guayna Capac succeeded his father as Sapan Inka, Chuptongo accompanied the new sovereign to Quito for the northern campaigns. After years of service, he asked Guayna Capac to allow him to return to his native people. His wish was granted; and, as a sign of his esteem, Guayna Capac made him a gift of one hundred women, one of the highest rewards possible in the Inca empire. In this way, Chuptongo established his house and lineage in the old town of Guzmango, fathered many children, and served as paramount lord until his death. The struggle for the throne between the two half brothers Huascar and Atahualpa, sons of Guayna Capac, also divided the sons of Chuptongo. During the civil war that broke out after Guayna Capac's death, Caruatongo, the oldest of Chuptongo's sons, sided with the northern forces of Atahualpa, while another son, Caruarayco, allied with Huascar, ruler of the south faction. In 1532 Atahualpa defeated his brother Hu√°scar in a battle for the Inca throne in Quito (in present-day Ecuador). On his way to Cusco to claim the throne with his army, he stopped at Cajamarca.Prescott, W.H., 2011, The History of the Conquest of Peru, Digireads.com Publishing, =Capture of Atahualpa (1532 A.D.); Colonial period= After arriving to Cajamarca, Francisco Pizarro received news that Atahualpa was resting in Pultumarca, a nearby hot springs complex, Pizarro soon sent some of representatives under command of the young captain Hernando De Soto to invite the Inca to a feast. After arriving at Atahualpa's camp, Hernando de Soto interviewed with Atahualpa. The Inca Emperor was seated on his gold throne or usnu, with two of his concubines on both sides holding a veil that made only his silhouette recognizable. Atahualpa, impressed by the Spanish horses, asked Hernando de Soto to do an equestrian demonstration. In the final act of his demonstration, Hernando De Soto rode on horseback directly up to Atahualpa to intimidate him stopping at the last moment,Davidson, James West. After the Fact: The Art of Historical Detection Volume 1. Mc Graw Hill, New York 2010, Chapter 1, p. 6 however Atahualpa did not move or change his expression in the slightest. Nevertheless, some of Atahualpa's retainers drew back and for it they were executed that day, after the Spanish committee returned to Cajamarca. Atahualpa agreed to meet with Pizarro the next day, oblivious of the ploy Pizarro had prepared for him. The following day, Atahualpa arrives in procession with his court and soldiers, although unarmed, Spanish accounts tell of the splendor shown by Atahulpa's display, in addition to musicians and dancers, Indians covered the Inca road on which their king would travel with hundreds of colorful flower petals, moreover, Atahualpa's retainers marched unison without speaking a word. Several noble leaders from conquered nations were also present, mostly local kuraka-kuna from the towns nearby, however, there were also notable Tawantinsuyu's nobles among them, there were the prominent rulers known as the \\"Lord of Cajamarca\\" and the \\"Lord of Chicha\\", both descendants of kings and owners of huge accumulations of wealth and lands in the Inca Empire, each one accompanied with its own sumptuous court, moreover, both were carried on litters in the same manner of Atahualpa. The Lord of Chicha's court was so opulent, even more than Atahualpa's, that the Spanish, most of them who did not meet Atahualpa until then, at first thought the Lord of Chicha was the Inca Emperor. Pizarro and his 168 soldiers met Atahualpa in the Cajamarca plaza after weeks of marching from Piura. The Spanish Conquistadors and their Indian allies captured Atahualpa in the Battle of Cajamarca, where they also massacred several thousand unarmed Inca civilians and soldiers in an audacious surprise attack of cannon, cavalry, lances and swords. The rest of the army of 40,000‚Äì80,000 (Conquistadors' estimates) was stationed some kilometers away from Cajamarca in a large military camp, near the Inca resort town of Pultamarca (currently known as \\"Ba√±os del Inca\\"), with its thousands of tents as looking from afar \\"like a very beautiful and well-ordered city, because everyone had his own tent\\". Believed Ransom Room of Atahualpa. Having taken Atahualpa captive, they held him in Cajamarca's main temple. Atahualpa offered his captors a ransom for his freedom: a room filled with gold and silver (possibly the place now known as El Cuarto del Rescate or \\"The Ransom Room\\"), within two months. Although having complied with the offering, Atahualpa was brought to trial and executed by the Spaniards. the Pizarros, Almagro, Candia, De Soto, Estete, and many others shared in the ransom. Caruatongo, the \\"Lord of Cajamarca\\", who was privileged enough to have been carried into the plaza of Cajamarca on a litter, a sure sign of the Inca's favor, died there on 16 November 1532, when Francisco Pizarro and his followers ambushed and killed many of the emperor's retainers and captured the Inca, Atahualpa. Although Caruatongo left an heir (named Alonso Chuplingon, after his Christian baptism), his brother, Caruarayco, succeeded him as headman following local customs. Pizarro himself recognized Caruarayco and confirmed his right to assume the authority of his father. Caruarayco took the name Felipe at his baptism, becoming the first Christian kuraka of Cajamarca. He remained a steadfast ally of the Spaniards during his lifetime, helping to convince the lords of the Chachapoyas people to submit to Spanish rule. Felipe Caruarayco was paramount lord of the people of Guzmango, in the province of Cajamarca, under the authority of the Spaniard, Melchior Verdugo. Pizarro had awarded Verdugo an encomienda in the region in 1 535. Documentation from that year described Felipe as the cacique principal of the province of Cajamarca and lord of Chuquimango, one of seven large lineages or guarangas (an administrative unit of one thousand households) that made up the polity. By 1543, however, Felipe was old and sick. His son, don Melchior Caruarayco, whom he favored to succeed him, was still too young to rule, so two relatives were designated as interim governors or regents: don Diego Zublian and don Pedro Angasnapon. Zublian kept this position until death in 1560, and then don Pedro appropriated for himself the title \\"cacique principal of the seven guarangas of Cajamarca\\", remaining in office until his death two years later. After his death, the people of Cajamarca asked the corregidor, don Pedro Juares de Illanez, to name don Melchior as their kuraka. After soliciting information from community elders, Illanez named him \\"natural lord and cacique principal of the seven guarangas of Cajamarca\\". As the paramount Andean lord of Cajamarca, don Melchior was responsible for the guaranga of Guzmango and two more parcialidades (lineages or other groupings of a larger community): Colquemarca (later Espiritu Santo de Chuquimango) and Malcaden (later San Lorenzo de Malcadan. This charge involved approximately five thousand adult males, under various lesser caciques; and, counting their families, the total population that he ruled approached fifty thousand. Most of these mountain people, who lived dispersed in more than five hundred small settlements, subsisted by farming and by herding llamas. Their tribute responsibilities included rotating labor service at the nearby silver mines of Chilete. During one of his many long trips down from the highlands to visit the nearest Spanish city, Trujillo, don Melchior was stricken by a serious illness. He prudently dictated his last will and testament before the local Spanish notary, Juan de Mata, on 20 June 1565. Coming as he did from a relatively remote area where very few Spaniards resided, his will reflects traditional Andean conceptions of society and values before they were fundamentally and forever changed. This is evident in the care he took to list all of his retainers. He claimed ten potters in the place of Cajamarca, a mayordomo or overseer from the parcialidad of Lord Santiago, a retainer from the parcialidad of don Francisco Angasnapon, and a beekeeper who lived near a river. In the town of Chulaquys, his followers included a lesser lord (mandoncillo) with jurisdiction over seven native families. At the mines of Chilete, he listed twenty workers who served him. Don Melchior also claimed six servants with no specific residence and at least twenty-four corn farmers and twenty- two pages in the town of Contumasa. Nine different subjects cared for his chili peppers and corn either in Cascas or near the town of Junba (now Santa Ana de Cimba?). He also listed the towns of Gironbi and Guaento, whose inhabitants guarded his coca and chili peppers; Cunchamalca, whose householders took care of his corn; and another town called Churcan de Cayanbi. Finally, he mentioned two towns that he was disputing with a native lord whose Christian name was don Pedro. In total, don Melchior claimed jurisdiction over a minimum of 102 followers and six towns, including the two in dispute. This preoccupation of don Melchior with listing all of his retainers shows how strong Andean traditions remained in the Cajamarca region, even thirty years after the Spanish invasion. Among the indigenous peoples, numbers of followers denoted tangible wealth and power. An Andean chronicler, Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala, wrote that lords \\"will gain rank if the numbers [of their subjects] multiply according to the law of the dominion over Indians. And, if their numbers decline, they too lose [status]\\". This concept of status was the same one held in the Inca system. The hatun curaca or huno apo, lord of ten thousand households, ranked higher than a guaranga curaca, the lord of one thousand. The latter dominated the lord of one hundred Indians, a pachaca camachicoc, who in turn was superior to the overseers (mandones and mandoncillos) with responsibility for as few as five households. Don Melchior, as a chief of seven guarangas, had jurisdiction over other lesser lords, who themselves ruled individual lineages. Geography Cajamarca is situated at 2750 m (8900 ft) above sea level on an inter-Andean valley irrigated by three main rivers: Mashcon, San Lucas and Chonta; the former two join together in this area to form the Cajamarca river. =Cityscape= Partial view of Cajamarca from Santa Apolonia Hill  Architecture  leftthumb312x312px Street in Cajamarca The style of ecclesiastical architecture in the city differs from other Peruvian cities due to the geographic and climatic conditions. Cajamarca is further north with a milder climate; the colonial builders used available stone rather than the clay of used in the coastal desert cities. Cajamarca has six Christian churches of Spanish colonial style: San Jose, La Recoleta, La Immaculada Concepcion, San Antonio, the Cathedral and El Belen. Although all were built in the seventeenth century, the latter three are the most outstanding due to their sculpted facades and ornamentation. The facades of these three churches were left unfinished, most likely due to lack of funds. The fa√ßade of the Cathedral is the most elegantly decorated, to the extent that it was completed. El Belen has a completed fa√ßade of the main building, but the tower is half finished. The San Antonio church was left mostly incomplete.Harold E. Wethey, Colonial Architecture and Sculpture in Peru (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1949), 129‚Äì139Damian Bayon and Murillo Marx, History of South American Colonial Art and Architecture (New York: Rizzoli Publications, 1992) = Church of Belen = This church consists of a single nave with no lateral chapels. Its facade is the most complete of the three, as it was the first to be designed and built. = Cathedral of Cajamarca = Originally designated to be a parish church, the cathedral took 80 years to construct (1682‚Äì1762); the fa√ßade remains unfinished. The Cathedral shows how colonial Spanish influence was introduced in the Incan territory. Side Portals: The side portals are made of pilasters on corbels. It also bears the royal escutcheon of Spain. The portal is considered to have a seventeenth- century character, found in the rectangular emphasis of the design. Plan: The plan of the cathedral is based on a basilica plan, (with a single apse, barrel vaults in the nave, a transept and sanctuary), but the traditional dome over the crossing has been omitted. Fa√ßade: The fa√ßade is noted for the detailing of its sculptures and the artistry in carving. Decorative details include grapevines carved into the spiral columns of the cathedral, with little birds pecking at the grapes. The frieze in the first story is composed of rectangular blocks carved with leaves. The detail of the main portal extends to flower pots and cherubs' heads next to pomegranates. \\"The fa√ßade of Cajamarca Cathedral is one of the remarkable achievements of Latin American art.\\" = San Antonio = Construction began in 1699, with the original plans made by Matias Perez Palomino. This church is similar in plan to the Cathedral, but the interiors are quite different. San Antonio is a significantly larger structure and has incorporated the large dome over the crossing. Features of the church include large cruciform piers with Doric pilasters, a plain cornice, and stone carved window frames. Fa√ßade: This fa√ßade is the most incomplete. While designed in a style similar to that of the cathedral, it is a simplified version. =Climate= Cajamarca has a subtropical highland climate (Cwb, in the K√∂ppen climate classification) which is characteristic of high elevations at tropical latitudes. This city presents a semi-dry, temperate, semi-cold climate with presence of rainfall mostly on spring and summer (from October to March) with little or no rainfall the rest of the year. Daily average temperatures have a great variation, being pleasant during the day but cold during the night and dawn. January is the warmest month, with an average maximum temperature of 72 ¬∞F (22 ¬∞C) and an average minimum of 45 ¬∞F (7 ¬∞C). The coldest months are June and July, both with an average maximum of 71 ¬∞F (21 ¬∞C) but with an average minimum of 38 ¬∞F (3 ¬∞C). Frosts may occur but are less frequent and less intense than in the southern Peruvian Andes.  Demographics  In recent years, the city has experienced a high rate of immigration from other provinces in the region and elsewhere in Peru, mainly due to the mining boom. This phenomenon has caused the city's population to increase considerably, from an estimated 80,931 in 1981 to an estimated 283,767 in 2014, an increase of almost three times the population for 33 years. Likewise, the city has recently entered into a conurbation process with the town of Ba√±os del Inca (which by 2014 has more than 20,000 inhabitants in the urban area) and with some populated centers close to these cities. According to INEI, projections exist for the urban conglomerate to reach 500,000 inhabitants by 2030. Economy Cajamarca is surrounded by a fertile valley, which makes this city an important center of trade of agricultural goods. Its most renowned industry is that of dairy products. Yanacocha is an active gold mining site 45 km north of Cajamarca, which has boosted the economy of the city since the 1990s.  Transportation  The only airport in Cajamarca is Armando Revoredo Airport located 3.26 km northeast of the main square. Cajamarca is connected to other northern Peruvian cities by bus transport companies. The construction of a railway has been proposed to connect mining areas in the region to a harbor in the Pacific Ocean. Education Cajamarca is home of one of the oldest high schools in Peru: San Ramon School, founded in 1831. Some of the largest, most important schools in the city include Marcelino Champagnat School, Cristo Rey School, Santa Teresita School, and Juan XXIII School. Cajamarca is also a centre of higher education in the northern Peruvian Andes. The city hosts two local universities: Universidad Nacional de Cajamarca (National University of Cajamarca), a public university, while Universidad Antonio Guillermo Urrelo is a private one. Five other universities have branches in Cajamarca: Universidad Antenor Orrego, Universidad San Pedro, Universidad Alas Peruanas, Universidad Los Angeles de Chimbote and Universidad Privada del Norte.  Culture  Cajamarca is home to the annual celebration of Carnaval, a time when the locals celebrate Carnival before the beginning of Lent. Carnival celebrations are full of parades, autochthonous dances and other cultural activities. A local Carnival custom is to spill water and/or some paint among friends or bypassers. During late January and early February this turns into an all-out water war between men and women (mostly between the ages of 6 and 25) who use buckets of water and water balloons to douse members of the opposite sex. Stores everywhere carry packs of water balloons during this time, and it is common to see wet spots on the pavement and groups of young people on the streets looking for \\"targets\\".

testing, the p-value is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct. (In the case of a composite null hypothesis, the largest such probability allowed under the null hypothesis is taken.) A very small p-value means that such an extreme observed outcome would be very unlikely under the null hypothesis. Reporting p-values of statistical tests is common practice in academic publications of many quantitative fields. Since the precise meaning of p-value is hard to grasp, misuse is widespread and has been a major topic in metascience.  Basic concepts  In statistics, every conjecture concerning the unknown probability distribution of a collection of random variables representing the observed data X in some study is called a statistical hypothesis. If we state one hypothesis only and the aim of the statistical test is to see whether this hypothesis is tenable, but not, at the same time, to investigate other hypotheses, then such a test is called a significance test. Note that the hypothesis might specify the probability distribution of X precisely, or it might only specify that it belongs to some class of distributions. Often, we reduce the data to a single numerical statistic T whose marginal probability distribution is closely connected to a main question of interest in the study. A statistical hypothesis that refers only to the numerical values of unknown parameters of the distribution of some statistic is called a parametric hypothesis. A hypothesis which specifies the distribution of the statistic uniquely is called simple, otherwise it is called composite. Methods of verifying statistical hypotheses are called statistical tests. Tests of parametric hypotheses are called parametric tests. We can likewise also have non-parametric hypotheses and non-parametric tests. The p-value is used in the context of null hypothesis testing in order to quantify the idea of statistical significance of evidence, the evidence being the observed value of the chosen statistic T. Null hypothesis testing is a reductio ad absurdum argument adapted to statistics. In essence, a claim is assumed valid if its counterclaim is highly implausible. Thus, the only hypothesis that needs to be specified in this test and which embodies the counterclaim is referred to as the null hypothesis; that is, the hypothesis to be nullified. A result is said to be statistically significant if it allows us to reject the null hypothesis. The result, being statistically significant, was highly improbable if the null hypothesis is assumed to be true. A rejection of the null hypothesis implies that the correct hypothesis lies in the logical complement of the null hypothesis. But no specific alternatives need to have been specified. The rejection of the null hypothesis does not tell us which of any possible alternatives might be better supported. However, the user of the test chose the test statistic T in the first place probably with particular alternatives in mind; such a test if often used precisely in order to convince people that those alternatives are viable because what was actually observed was extremely unlikely under the null hypothesis. As a particular example, if a null hypothesis states that a certain summary statistic T follows the standard normal distribution N(0,1), then the rejection of this null hypothesis could mean that (i) the mean is not 0, or (ii) the variance is not 1, or (iii) the distribution is not normal. Different tests of the same null hypothesis would be more or less sensitive to different alternatives. Anyway, if we do manage to reject the null hypothesis, even if we know the distribution is normal and variance is 1, the null hypothesis test does not tell us which non-zero values of the mean are now most plausible. If one has a huge amount of independent observations from the same probability distribution, one will eventually be able to show that their mean value is not precisely equal to zero; but the deviation from zero could be so small as to have no practical or scientific interest. If T is a real-valued random variable representing some function of the observed data, to be used as a test-statistic for testing a hypothesis H because large values of T would seem to discredit the hypothesis, and if it happens to take on the actual value t, then the p-value of the so called one- sided test of the null-hypothesis H based on that test-statistic is the largest value of the probability that T could be larger than or equal to t if H is true.  Definition and interpretation  = General = probability density of each outcome, computed under the null hypothesis. The p-value is the area under the curve past the observed data point. The p-value is defined as the best (largest) probability, under the null hypothesis H about the unknown distribution of the test statistic T, to have observed a value as extreme or more extreme than the value actually observed. If t is the observed value, then very often, \\"as extreme or more extreme than what was actually observed\\" means \\\\\\\\{ T \\\\geq t \\\\\\\\} (right-tail event), but one often also looks at outcomes which are extreme in the other direction, or which are extreme in either direction. If the null hypothesis specifies the probability distribution of the test statistic uniquely, then the p-value is given by * \\\\Pr(T \\\\geq t H) for a one-sided (right tail) test, * \\\\Pr(T \\\\leq t H) for a one-sided (left tail) test, * 2\\\\min\\\\\\\\{\\\\Pr(T \\\\leq t H),\\\\Pr(T \\\\geq t H)\\\\\\\\} for a two-sided test, Notice that just by replacing T by -T one converts a test based on extremely large values to a test based on extremely small values; and by replacing T by T one gets a test with p-value * \\\\Pr(T \\\\leq -t H) +\\\\Pr(T \\\\geq +t H)\\\\\\\\}. If the null hypothesis allows the test statistic many possible probability distributions, then one works with the worst-case probability, i.e., the one uses the probability distribution under the null hypothesis that is most favourable to the null hypothesis. If the p-value is very small, then the statistical significance is thought to be very large: under the hypothesis under consideration, something very unlikely has occurred. The investigator who is performing the test probably chose it precisely because they want to discredit the null hypothesis by giving evidence that an alternative explanation of the data should be sought. In a formal significance test, the null hypothesis H is rejected if, under the null hypothesis, the probability of such an extreme value (as extreme, or even more extreme) as that which was actually observed is less than or equal to a small, fixed pre-defined threshold value \\\\alpha, which is referred to as the level of significance. Unlike the p-value, the \\\\alpha level is not derived from any observational data and does not depend on the underlying hypothesis; the value of \\\\alpha is instead set by the researcher before examining the data. The setting of \\\\alpha is arbitrary. By convention, \\\\alpha is commonly set to 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, or 0.001. The p-value is a function of the chosen test statistic T and is therefore a random variable in itself. If the null hypothesis fixes the probability distribution of T precisely, and if that distribution is continuous, then when the null-hypothesis is true, the p-value is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, and observing it to take on a value very close to 0 is thought to discredit the hypothesis. Thus, the p-value is not fixed. If the same test is repeated independently with fresh data (always with the same probability distribution), one will find different p-values at every repetition. If the null-hypothesis is composite, or the distribution of the statistic is discrete, the probability of obtaining a p-value less than or equal to any number between 0 and 1 is less than or equal to that number, if the null-hypothesis is true. It remains the case that very small values are very unlikely if the null-hypothesis is true, and that a significance test at level \\\\alpha is obtained by rejecting the null-hypothesis if the significance level is less than or equal to \\\\alpha. Different p-values based on independent sets of data can be combined, for instance using Fisher's combined probability test. = Distribution = When the null hypothesis is true, if it takes the form H_0: \\\\theta = \\\\theta_0, and the underlying random variable is continuous, then the probability distribution of the p-value is uniform on the interval [0,1]. By contrast, if the alternative hypothesis is true, the distribution is dependent on sample size and the true value of the parameter being studied. The distribution of p-values for a group of studies is sometimes called a p-curve. The curve is affected by four factors: the proportion of studies that examined false null hypotheses, the power of the studies that investigated false null hypotheses, the alpha levels, and publication bias. A p-curve can be used to assess the reliability of scientific literature, such as by detecting publication bias or p-hacking. =For composite hypothesis= In parametric hypothesis testing problems, a simple or point hypothesis refers to a hypothesis where the parameter's value is assumed to be a single number. In contrast, in a composite hypothesis the parameter's value is given by a set of numbers. For example, when testing the null hypothesis that a distribution is normal with a mean less than or equal to zero against the alternative that the mean is greater than zero (variance known), the null hypothesis does not specify the probability distribution of the appropriate test statistic. In the just mentioned example that would be the Z-statistic belonging to the one-sided one-sample Z-test. For each possible value of the theoretical mean, the Z-test statistic has a different probability distribution. In these circumstances (the case of a so-called composite null hypothesis) the p-value is defined by taking the least favourable null-hypothesis case, which is typically on the border between null and alternative. This definition ensures the complementarity of p-values and alpha-levels. If we set the significance level alpha to 0.05, and only reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than or equal to 0.05, then our hypothesis test will indeed have significance level (maximal type 1 error rate) 0.05. As Neyman wrote: ‚ÄúThe error that a practising statistician would consider the more important to avoid (which is a subjective judgment) is called the error of the first kind. The first demand of the mathematical theory is to deduce such test criteria as would ensure that the probability of committing an error of the first kind would equal (or approximately equal, or not exceed) a preassigned number Œ±, such as Œ± = 0.05 or 0.01, etc. This number is called the level of significance‚Äù; Neyman 1976, p. 161 in \\"The Emergence of Mathematical Statistics: A Historical Sketch with Particular Reference to the United States\\",\\"On the History of Statistics and Probability\\", ed. D.B. Owen, New York: Marcel Dekker, pp. 149-193. See also \\"Confusion Over Measures of Evidence (p's) Versus Errors (a's)in Classical Statistical Testing\\", Raymond Hubbard and M. J. Bayarri, The American Statistician, August 2003, Vol. 57, No 3, 171--182 (with discussion). For a concise modern statement see Chapter 10 of \\"All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference\\", Springer; 1st Corrected ed. 20 edition (September 17, 2004). Larry Wasserman. = Misconceptions = According to the ASA, there is widespread agreement that p-values are often misused and misinterpreted. One practice that has been particularly criticized is accepting the alternative hypothesis for any p-value nominally less than .05 without other supporting evidence. Although p-values are helpful in assessing how incompatible the data are with a specified statistical model, contextual factors must also be considered, such as \\"the design of a study, the quality of the measurements, the external evidence for the phenomenon under study, and the validity of assumptions that underlie the data analysis\\". Another concern is that the p-value is often misunderstood as being the probability that the null hypothesis is true. Some statisticians have proposed replacing p-values with alternative measures of evidence, such as confidence intervals, likelihood ratios, or Bayes factors, but there is heated debate on the feasibility of these alternatives. Others have suggested to remove fixed significance thresholds and to interpret p-values as continuous indices of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. Yet others suggested to report alongside p-values the prior probability of a real effect that would be required to obtain a false positive risk (i.e. the probability that there is no real effect) below a pre-specified threshold (e.g. 5%).  Usage  The p-value is widely used in statistical hypothesis testing, specifically in null hypothesis significance testing. In this method, as part of experimental design, before performing the experiment, one first chooses a model (the null hypothesis) and a threshold value for p, called the significance level of the test, traditionally 5% or 1% and denoted as Œ±. If the p-value is less than the chosen significance level (Œ±), that suggests that the observed data is sufficiently inconsistent with the null hypothesis and that the null hypothesis may be rejected. However, that does not prove that the tested hypothesis is false. When the p-value is calculated correctly, this test guarantees that the type I error rate is at most Œ±. For typical analysis, using the standard Œ± = 0.05 cutoff, the null hypothesis is rejected when p < .05 and not rejected when p > .05. The p-value does not, in itself, support reasoning about the probabilities of hypotheses but is only a tool for deciding whether to reject the null hypothesis.  Calculation  Usually, T is a test statistic, rather than any of the actual observations. A test statistic is the output of a scalar function of all the observations. This statistic provides a single number, such as the average or the correlation coefficient, that summarizes the characteristics of the data, in a way relevant to a particular inquiry. As such, the test statistic follows a distribution determined by the function used to define that test statistic and the distribution of the input observational data. For the important case in which the data are hypothesized to be a random sample from a normal distribution, depending on the nature of the test statistic and the hypotheses of interest about its distribution, different null hypothesis tests have been developed. Some such tests are the z-test for hypotheses concerning the mean of a normal distribution with known variance, the t-test based on Student's t-distribution of a suitable statistic for hypotheses concerning the mean of a normal distribution when the variance is unknown, the F-test based on the F-distribution of yet another statistic for hypotheses concerning the variance. For data of other nature, for instance categorical (discrete) data, test statistics might be constructed whose null hypothesis distribution is based on normal approximations to appropriate statistics obtained by invoking the central limit theorem for large samples, as in the case of Pearson's chi- squared test. Thus computing a p-value requires a null hypothesis, a test statistic (together with deciding whether the researcher is performing a one- tailed test or a two-tailed test), and data. Even though computing the test statistic on given data may be easy, computing the sampling distribution under the null hypothesis, and then computing its cumulative distribution function (CDF) is often a difficult problem. Today, this computation is done using statistical software, often via numeric methods (rather than exact formulae), but, in the early and mid 20th century, this was instead done via tables of values, and one interpolated or extrapolated p-values from these discrete values. Rather than using a table of p-values, Fisher instead inverted the CDF, publishing a list of values of the test statistic for given fixed p-values; this corresponds to computing the quantile function (inverse CDF). Examples =Coin flipping= As an example of a statistical test, an experiment is performed to determine whether a coin flip is fair (equal chance of landing heads or tails) or unfairly biased (one outcome being more likely than the other). Suppose that the experimental results show the coin turning up heads 14 times out of 20 total flips. The full data X would be a sequence of twenty times the symbol \\"H\\" or \\"T\\". The statistic on which one might focus, could be the total number T of heads. The null hypothesis is that the coin is fair, and coin tosses are independent of one another. If a right-tailed test is considered, which would be the case if one is actually interested in the possibility that the coin is biased towards falling heads, then the p-value of this result is the chance of a fair coin landing on heads at least 14 times out of 20 flips. That probability can be computed from binomial coefficients as : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\operatorname{Prob}(14\\\\text{ heads}) + \\\\operatorname{Prob}(15\\\\text{ heads}) + \\\\cdots + \\\\operatorname{Prob}(20\\\\text{ heads})  & = \\\\frac{1}{2^{20}} \\\\left[ \\\\binom{20}{14} + \\\\binom{20}{15} + \\\\cdots + \\\\binom{20}{20} \\\\right] = \\\\frac{60,\\\\\\\\!460}{1,\\\\\\\\!048,\\\\\\\\!576} \\\\approx 0.058 \\\\end{align} This probability is the p-value, considering only extreme results that favor heads. This is called a one-tailed test. However, one might be interested in deviations in either direction, favoring either heads or tails. The two-tailed p-value, which considers deviations favoring either heads or tails, may instead be calculated. As the binomial distribution is symmetrical for a fair coin, the two-sided p-value is simply twice the above calculated single-sided p-value: the two-sided p-value is 0.115. In the above example: * Null hypothesis (H0): The coin is fair, with Prob(heads) = 0.5 * Test statistic: Number of heads * Alpha level (designated threshold of significance): 0.05 * Observation O: 14 heads out of 20 flips; and * Two- tailed p-value of observation O given H0 = 2*min(Prob(no. of heads ‚â• 14 heads), Prob(no. of heads ‚â§ 14 heads))= 2*min(0.058, 0.978) = 2*0.058 = 0.115. Note that the Prob (no. of heads ‚â§ 14 heads) = 1 - Prob(no. of heads ‚â• 14 heads) + Prob (no. of head = 14) = 1 - 0.058 + 0.036 = 0.978; however, symmetry of the binomial distribution makes it an unnecessary computation to find the smaller of the two probabilities. Here, the calculated p-value exceeds .05, meaning that the data falls within the range of what would happen 95% of the time were the coin in fact fair. Hence, the null hypothesis is not rejected at the .05 level. However, had one more head been obtained, the resulting p-value (two-tailed) would have been 0.0414 (4.14%), in which case the null hypothesis would be rejected at the .05 level. History John Arbuthnot Pierre-Simon Laplace Karl Pearson Ronald Fisher Computations of p-values date back to the 1700s, where they were computed for the human sex ratio at birth, and used to compute statistical significance compared to the null hypothesis of equal probability of male and female births. John Arbuthnot studied this question in 1710, and examined birth records in London for each of the 82 years from 1629 to 1710. In every year, the number of males born in London exceeded the number of females. Considering more male or more female births as equally likely, the probability of the observed outcome is 0.582, or about 1 in 4,836,000,000,000,000,000,000,000; in modern terms, the p-value. This is vanishingly small, leading Arbuthnot that this was not due to chance, but to divine providence: \\"From whence it follows, that it is Art, not Chance, that governs.\\" In modern terms, he rejected the null hypothesis of equally likely male and female births at the p = 1/282 significance level. This and other work by Arbuthnot is credited as \\"‚Ä¶ the first use of significance tests ‚Ä¶\\" the first example of reasoning about statistical significance, and \\"‚Ä¶ perhaps the first published report of a nonparametric test ‚Ä¶\\", specifically the sign test; see details at . The same question was later addressed by Pierre-Simon Laplace, who instead used a parametric test, modeling the number of male births with a binomial distribution: The p-value was first formally introduced by Karl Pearson, in his Pearson's chi-squared test, using the chi- squared distribution and notated as capital P. The p-values for the chi- squared distribution (for various values of œá2 and degrees of freedom), now notated as P, was calculated in , collected in . The use of the p-value in statistics was popularized by Ronald Fisher, and it plays a central role in his approach to the subject. In his influential book Statistical Methods for Research Workers (1925), Fisher proposed the level p = 0.05, or a 1 in 20 chance of being exceeded by chance, as a limit for statistical significance, and applied this to a normal distribution (as a two-tailed test), thus yielding the rule of two standard deviations (on a normal distribution) for statistical significance (see 68‚Äì95‚Äì99.7 rule). He then computed a table of values, similar to Elderton but, importantly, reversed the roles of œá2 and p. That is, rather than computing p for different values of œá2 (and degrees of freedom n), he computed values of œá2 that yield specified p-values, specifically 0.99, 0.98, 0.95, 0,90, 0.80, 0.70, 0.50, 0.30, 0.20, 0.10, 0.05, 0.02, and 0.01. That allowed computed values of œá2 to be compared against cutoffs and encouraged the use of p-values (especially 0.05, 0.02, and 0.01) as cutoffs, instead of computing and reporting p-values themselves. The same type of tables were then compiled in , which cemented the approach. As an illustration of the application of p-values to the design and interpretation of experiments, in his following book The Design of Experiments (1935), Fisher presented the lady tasting tea experiment, which is the archetypal example of the p-value. To evaluate a lady's claim that she (Muriel Bristol) could distinguish by taste how tea is prepared (first adding the milk to the cup, then the tea, or first tea, then milk), she was sequentially presented with 8 cups: 4 prepared one way, 4 prepared the other, and asked to determine the preparation of each cup (knowing that there were 4 of each). In that case, the null hypothesis was that she had no special ability, the test was Fisher's exact test, and the p-value was 1/\\\\binom{8}{4} = 1/70 \\\\approx 0.014, so Fisher was willing to reject the null hypothesis (consider the outcome highly unlikely to be due to chance) if all were classified correctly. (In the actual experiment, Bristol correctly classified all 8 cups.) Fisher reiterated the p = 0.05 threshold and explained its rationale, stating: He also applies this threshold to the design of experiments, noting that had only 6 cups been presented (3 of each), a perfect classification would have only yielded a p-value of 1/\\\\binom{6}{3} = 1/20 = 0.05, which would not have met this level of significance. Fisher also underlined the interpretation of p, as the long- run proportion of values at least as extreme as the data, assuming the null hypothesis is true. In later editions, Fisher explicitly contrasted the use of the p-value for statistical inference in science with the Neyman‚ÄìPearson method, which he terms \\"Acceptance Procedures\\". Fisher emphasizes that while fixed levels such as 5%, 2%, and 1% are convenient, the exact p-value can be used, and the strength of evidence can and will be revised with further experimentation. In contrast, decision procedures require a clear-cut decision, yielding an irreversible action, and the procedure is based on costs of error, which, he argues, are inapplicable to scientific research.  Related quantities  A closely related concept is the E-value,National Institutes of Health definition of E-value which is the expected number of times in multiple testing that one expects to obtain a test statistic at least as extreme as the one that was actually observed if one assumes that the null hypothesis is true. The E-value is the product of the number of tests and the p-value. The q-value is the analog of the p-value with respect to the positive false discovery rate. It is used in multiple hypothesis testing to maintain statistical power while minimizing the false positive rate.

During the Inca Empire and Viceroyalty of Peru periods the city was known by the name of Huamanga (Quechua: Wamanga), and it continues to be the alternative name of the city. The city's name was officially changed to Ayacucho after a major victory of the revolutionary army led by Bol√≠var's lieutenants against the royalists. Sim√≥n Bol√≠var issued the decree on February 15, 1825, changing the name from \\"Huamanga\\" to \\"Ayacucho\\", referring to a major battle for independence that established once and for all the total independence of the nascent Peruvian Republic, as stated by Bolivar's decree, \\"Obtained the victory in... Huamanga, its name must be changed, in a way that perennially reminds those inhabitants the origin of their freedom.\\" The name Ayacucho is derived from the Quechua words aya (\\"death\\" or \\"soul\\") and k'uchu (\\"corner\\") in honor of the battle's casualties. Ayacucho is famous for its 33 churches, which represent one for each year of Jesus' life. Ayacucho has large religious celebrations, especially during the Holy Week of Easter. These celebrations include horse races featuring Peruvian Caballos de Paso and the traditional running of the bulls, known locally as the jalatoro or pascuatoro. The jalatoro is similar to the Spanish encierro, except that the bulls are led by horses of the Morochucos. History Vestiges of human settlements more than 15,000 years old have been found in the site of Pikimachay, about 25 km north of Ayacucho. From 500 to 900, the region became occupied by the Wari culture, which became known as the first expansionist empire based in the Andes before the Inca Empire.

The Ayacucho region was inhabited by varying indigenous cultures for thousands of years. During the Early Intermediate period (200 BC ‚Äì 600 AD) the Nazca culture settled in the south-west, and the Warpa culture arose in the center of the Ayacucho region, the Wari Empire emerged as Huarpa cultures interacted with the nearby Nasca Culture at a time of intense interregional exchanges and widespread disruption to existing cultural traditions.https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803121023895 During the Middle Horizon period (600 ‚Äì 1000 AD), at its zenith the Wari state reigned over most of the highlands and coast of Peru, centered near the present-day city of Ayacucho (Huamanga), the Wari became the largest dominant culture in the Andes region before the Inca came into existence. The Wari civilization collapsed by about 1000 AD, the capital city of Wari was abandoned. With the end of the Wari culture, the Late Intermediate period (1000 AD ‚Äì 1476 AD) is said to begin, while some post-Wari cultures continued to further develop during this era, particularly cultures from coastal Peru, the Late Intermediate era is marked by population decline and substantial cultural regression over extensive areas of the Peruvian highlands, the Ayacucho region became one of the most affected areas, urban planning ceased to be, people abandoned virtually all cities, if not all, and dispersed into rural hamlets.https://books.google.com/books?id=qcSsoJ0IXawC&pg;=PA203 New tribal cultures ‚Äî well differentiated from the old Wari ‚Äî arose in the Ayacucho region, over time these became a series of relatively powerful warlike chiefdoms that controlled region, according to colonial chroniclers these tribes were united into a confederacy by the time Inca began to expand, referred in the Spanish accounts as the \\"Chanca confederacy\\", an alliance formed by the Chanca, Parinacocha, Vilca, Sora, and Rucana (Lucana) cultures, among other ayllu clans. After a series of fierce battles the Inca managed to defeat and conquer the Chanka confederacy and integrated the area into the Inca Empire, the Inca founded Vilcashuaman within Vilcas' culture territory, one of the most populous cities known to have existed in the Inca Empire,https://books.google.com/books?id=OFR6AAAAMAAJ&pg;=PA188 capital of the Inca province (wamani) of Vilcas.https://books.google.com/books?id=EFD-iAC- xKEC&pg;=PA223 Huamanga was another of the administrative centers in the region, founded at a place called Pocra.https://books.google.com/books?id=OFR6AAAAMAAJ&pg;=PA188 The Spanish colonial founding of Huamanga was led by conqueror Francisco Pizarro on April 25, 1540, who named it San Juan de la Frontera de Huamanga.David Scott Palmer, \\"Ayacucho\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 1, p. 245. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. Due to the constant Incan rebellion led by Manco Inca Yupanqui against the Spanish in the zone, Pizarro was quick to populate the settlement with a small number of Spaniards brought from Lima and Cusco. On May 17, 1544, by Royal decree, Ayacucho was titled La Muy Noble y Leal Ciudad de Huamanga (the most noble and loyal city of Huamanga), the highest designation in the Spanish hierarchy of naming cities. The city's main University was founded on July 3, 1677 as San Crist√≥bal of Huamanga University. Ayacucho was significant in the colonial era for being an administrative center, a stopping-off point between Lima and Cuzco, and the residence of mercury miner from Huancavelica, as well as local land owners.Palmer, \\"Ayacucho\\", p. 245. On February 15, 1825, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var changed the city's name to Ayacucho, renaming it after the historical Battle of Ayacucho. Upon seeing so many casualties on the battlefield, citizens called the area Ayakuchu, aya meaning \\"dead\\" and kuchu meaning \\"corner\\" in Ayacucho Quechua. The Battle of Ayacucho was the last armed clash between the Spanish Army (formed mostly by Peruvian mestizos and indigenous peoples) and independentists during the Peruvian War of Independence, and the independents' victory ensured independence. The battle developed in the nearby pampas of La Quinua on December 9, 1824. Independentist forces were led by Antonio Jos√© de Sucre, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var's lieutenant. Viceroy Jos√© de la Serna e Hinojosa was wounded, and after the battle second commander-in-chief Jos√© de Canterac signed the final capitulation of the Royalist army. The independent victory sealed the independence of Peru and South America. La Paz, now the seat of government of Bolivia, was similarly renamed La Paz de Ayacucho following this battle. Although the city gained a new name and some fame, the economy declined following independence. There were attempts to revive the city's fortunes, with a planned railway link to Peru's network, but the line was terminated in Huancavelica. A highway was subsequently constructed in 1968. The city's economy is based on agriculture and light manufacturing, including textiles, pottery, leather goods, and filigree ware. It is a regional tourism destination, known for its 33 churches built in the colonial period, and for the nearby battlefield of La Quinua, where the Ayacucho battle was fought in 1824. The University of San Crist√≥bal was reopened in 1959. The city's population began to increase, but violent political unrest destabilized the region forced migration of many. In 1980, the far-left terrorist organization known as the Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso) used Ayachucho as its base for its campaign against the Peruvian government, even staging an assault on the Ayacucho prison in 1982. The campaign faded after the leader Abimael Guzm√°n Reynoso was captured in 1992 and put in prison. The region headed by Ayacucho is rural and one of the poorest of all the country. With the peace of the last 15 years, the citizens work hard to improve the living conditions and attract jobs.

Yields were lower than other varieties and the crops were rarely healthy; consequently wine growers chose more versatile and less coulure- susceptible grapes when replanting the vines and Carm√©n√®re planting was progressively abandoned. = Rediscovery = Chile Far from being extinct, in recent years the Carm√©n√®re grape has been discovered to be thriving in several areas outside France. In Chile, growers inadvertently preserved the grape variety during the last 150 years because it was mistaken for Merlot. Merlot grapes Cuttings of Carm√©n√®re were imported by Chilean growers from Bordeaux during the 19th century, where they were frequently confused with Merlot vines. They modeled their wineries after those in France and in the 1850s cuttings from Bordeaux, which included Carm√©n√®re grape, were planted in the valleys around Santiago. Thanks to central Chile's minimal rainfall during the growing season and the protection of the country's natural boundaries, growers produced healthier crops of Carm√©n√®re, and there was no spread of phylloxera. During most of the 20th century Carm√©n√®re was inadvertently collected and processed together with Merlot grapes (probably reaching up to 50% of the total volume) giving Chilean Merlot markedly different properties from those of Merlot produced elsewhere.OopsWines.com, Mystery of The Lost Grape of Bordeaux solved; (oops)‚Ñ¢ now on wine shelves across America. Schwartz Olcott Imports, December 15, 2006. Chilean growers believed that this grape was a clone of Merlot and was known as Merlot selection or Merlot Peumal (after the Peumo Valley in Chile). In 1994, Carm√©n√®re was re-discovered as a distinct varietal in Chile by French ampelographist Jean Boursiquot, a researcher at Montpellier's school of Oenology who found that \\"an earlier-ripening vine was Bordeaux Carm√©n√®re, not Merlot\\". The Chilean Department of Agriculture officially recognized Carm√©n√®re as a distinct variety in 1998.See Alley, L. The French connection: Jean-Michel Boursiquot., Highbeam.com.

Italy A similar situation occurred in Italy when, in 1990, the Ca' del Bosco Winery acquired what they thought was Cabernet Franc vines from a French nursery. The growers noticed that the grapes were different from the traditional Cabernet Franc both in color and taste. They also noticed that the vines ripened earlier than Cabernet Franc would have. Other Italian wine regions also started to doubt the origin of these vines and it was finally established to be Carm√©n√®re. Although, in Italy, the variety is grown mainly in the northeast part of the country from Brescia to Friuli, it has only recently been entered into Italy's national catalog of vine varieties and thus \\"no district has yet requested the authorization to use it\\". Therefore, the wine \\"cannot be cultivated with its original name or specific vintage and the name cannot be used to identify the wine on the label with an IGT, DOC or a DOCG status assignment.\\"Terlato Wines International, Ca' del Bosco. .

In 2007 the grape was authorised to be used in Italian DOC wines from Veneto (Arcole, Bagnoli di Sopra, Cori Benedettine del Padovano, Garda, Merlara, Monti Lessini, Riviera del Brenta and Vicenza), Friuli-Venezia Giulia (Collio, or Collio Goriziano) and Sardinia (Alghero).

Other regions In modern-day France only a few hundred acres of Carm√©n√®re officially exist, although there are rumors of renewed interest among growers in Bordeaux. Carm√©n√®re has also been established in Eastern Washington's Walla Walla Valley and in California, United States.Sally's Place, Make Way for the 6th Bordeaux Variety by Sara and Monty Preiser. Retrieved February 19, 2008. In the 1980s, Karen Mulander- Magoon, the co-proprietor of Guenoc and Langtry Estates Winery, in California's Lake County, brought the grape to the vineyard. This was a joint effort with Louis Pierre Pradier, \\"a French research scientist and viticulturalist whose work involved preserving Carm√©n√®re from extinction in France.\\" Once the vines were quarantined and checked for diseases they were legalized for admission into California in the 1990s, where they were cloned and planted. In Australia, three cuttings of Carm√©n√®re were imported from Chile by renowned viticultural expert Dr Richard Smart in the late 1990s. After two years in quarantine, only one cutting survived the heat treatment to eliminate viruses and was micro-propagated (segments of individual buds grown on nutrient gel) and field grown by Narromine Vine Nursery. The first vines from the nursery were planted in 2002 by Amietta Vineyard and Winery in the Moorabool Valley (Geelong, Victoria) who use Carm√©n√®re in their Angels' Share blend. Carm√©n√®re has also been established in small amounts in New Zealand. DNA testing confirmed in 2006 that plantings of Cabernet Franc in the Matakana region were in fact Carm√©n√®re. Loz√§rn Wines,https://lozarn.co.za/#Home situated on Doornbosch farm in the Robertson region of the Western Cape, is the champion of the Carm√©n√®re grape variety in South Africa. Their first planting of a Carm√©n√®re vineyard was in 2014. From this vineyard the first single-varietal Carm√©n√®re was produced in South Africa. Loz√§rn Wines, owned by the Smuts family, produces both a single-varietal Carm√©n√®re as well as a ros√© Carm√©n√®re. The estate launched their maiden vintage of the single-varietal Carm√©n√®re in December 2017 with only 100 bottles, as well as a 100 per cent Carm√©n√®re Ros√© 2017. Loz√§rn has only half a hectare currently producing the red and ros√©, and has another 1.8ha planted. South Africa has only 8.5ha planted of this lost child of Bordeaux.  Viticulture  Carm√©n√®re favors a long growing season in moderate to warm climates. During harvest time and the winter period the vine fares poorly if it is introduced to high levels of rain or irrigation water. This is particularly true in poor-soil plantings where the vine would need more water. Over-watering during this period accentuates the herbaceous and green pepper characteristics of the grape. The grape naturally develops high levels of sugar before the tannins achieve ripeness. If grown in too hot a climate the resulting wine will have a high alcohol level and low balance. Carm√©n√®re buds and flowers three to seven days later than Merlot and the yield is lower than that of the latter grape. The Carm√©n√®re leaves turn to crimson before dropping. Carm√©n√®re is produced in wineries either as a single-variety wine (sometimes called a varietal wine), or as a blend usually with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet franc or Merlot.  Distinction from Merlot  Differences between Carm√©n√®re and Merlot grapes Genetic research has shown that Carm√©n√®re may be distantly related to Merlot and the similarities in appearance have linked the two vines for centuries. Despite the similarities, there are some noticeable differences that aid the ampelographer in identifying the two vines. When young, Carm√©n√®re leaves have a reddish hue underneath, while the leaves of Merlot are white. There are also slight differences in leaf shape with the central lobe of Merlot leaves being longer. Merlot ripens two to three weeks earlier than Carm√©n√®re. In cases where the vineyards are interspersed with both varieties, the time of harvest is paramount in determining the character of the resulting blends. If Merlot grapes are picked when Carm√©n√®re is fully ripe, they will be overripe and impart a \\"jammy\\" character. If the grapes are picked earlier when only the Merlot grapes have reached ripeness, the Carm√©n√®re will have an aggressive green pepper flavor. Thus, although different, Merlot and Carm√©n√®re were often confused but never thought to be identical. Its distinctive differences meant the grape was called a \\"Merlot selection\\" or \\"Merlot Peumal,\\" which was \\"a geographic reference to a valley south of Santiago where lots of Carm√©n√®re was grown\\" before its true identity was established.  Characteristics  Carm√©n√®re wine has a deep red color and aromas found in red fruits, spices and berries. The tannins are gentler and softer than those in Cabernet Sauvignon and it is a medium body wine.PCCNaturalMarkets.com, Resources, Healthnotes: Red wines - Carmenere. Retrieved December 16, 2007. As a result many find it can be drunk easily with fish. Although mostly used as a blending grape, wineries do bottle a pure varietal Carm√©n√®re which, when produced from grapes at optimal ripeness, imparts a cherry-like, fruity flavor with smoky, spicy and earthy notes and a deep crimson color. Its taste might also be reminiscent of dark chocolate, tobacco, and leather. The wine is best to drink while it is young.

Once the body has generated antibodies to a hapten-carrier adduct, the small-molecule hapten may also be able to bind to the antibody, but it will usually not initiate an immune response; usually only the hapten- carrier adduct can do this. Sometimes the small-molecule hapten can even block immune response to the hapten-carrier adduct by preventing the adduct from binding to the antibody, a process called hapten inhibition. The mechanisms of absence of immune response may vary and involve complex immunological mechanisms, but can include absent or insufficient co-stimulatory signals from antigen-presenting cells. Haptens have been used to study allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) and the mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to induce autoimmune-like responses. The concept of haptens emerged from the work of Karl Landsteiner who also pioneered the use of synthetic haptens to study immunochemical phenomena. Examples of haptens The first researched haptens were aniline and its carboxyl derivatives (o-, m-, and p-aminobenzoic acid).Based on K. Landsteiner, 1962, The Specificity of Serologic Reactions, Dover Press A well-known example of a hapten is urushiol, which is the toxin found in poison ivy. When absorbed through the skin from a poison ivy plant, urushiol undergoes oxidation in the skin cells to generate the actual hapten, a reactive quinone-type molecule, which then reacts with skin proteins to form hapten adducts. Usually, the first exposure causes only sensitization, in which there is a proliferation of effector T-cells. After a subsequent, second exposure, the proliferated T-cells can become activated, generating an immune reaction that produces typical blisters of a poison ivy exposure. Some haptens can induce autoimmune disease. An example is hydralazine, a blood pressure- lowering drug that occasionally can produce drug-induced lupus erythematosus in certain individuals. This also appears to be the mechanism by which the anaesthetic gas halothane can cause a life-threatening hepatitis, as well as the mechanism by which penicillin-class drugs cause autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Other haptens that are commonly used in molecular biology applications include fluorescein, biotin, digoxigenin, and dinitrophenol. Lastly, nickel allergy is caused by nickel metal ions penetrating the skin and binding to skin proteins. Hapten conjugation Due to their nature and properties, hapten-carrier adducts have been essential in immunology. They have been used to evaluate the properties of specific epitopes and antibodies. They are important in the purification and production of monoclonal antibodies. They are also vital in the development of sensitive quantitative and qualitative immunoassays. However, to achieve the best and most desirable results, many factors are needed to be taken into the design of hapten conjugates. These include the method of hapten conjugation, the type of carrier used and the hapten density. Variations in these factors could lead to different strengths of immune response toward the newly formed antigenic determinant. In general, these carrier proteins should be immmunogenic and contain enough amino acid residues in the reactive side chains to conjugate with the haptens. Depending on the haptens being used, other factors in considering the carrier proteins could include their in vivo toxicity, commercial availability and cost. The most common carriers include serum globulin, albumins, ovalbumin and many others. Although proteins are mostly employed for hapten conjugation, synthetic polypeptides such as Poly-L-glutamic acid, polysaccharides and liposomes could also be used. =Methods of Hapten Conjugation= While selecting a suitable method for hapten conjugation, functional groups on the hapten and its carrier must be identified. Depending on the groups present, one of the two main strategies could be employed: #Spontaneous Chemical Reaction: Used when hapten is a chemical reactive molecule such as anhydrides and isocyanates. This method of conjugation is spontaneous and no cross- linking agents are needed. #Intermediary Molecules Cross-linkage: This method mainly applies to nonreactive haptens. Agents with at least two chemically reactive groups such as carbodiimide or glutaraldehyde are to aid the conjugation of haptens to their carriers. The extent of cross-linkage is dependent upon the hapten/carrier to coupling agent ratio, hapten/carrier concentration and the temperature, pH of the environment. #*Carbodiimide: A group of compounds with a general formula of R-N=C=N-R‚Ä≤, where R and R‚Ä≤ are either aliphatic (i.e., diethylcarbodiimide) or aromatic (i.e., diphenylcarbodiimide). Conjugation using a carbodiimide requires the presence of Œ± or …õ-amino and a carboxyl group. The amino group usually comes from the lysyl residue of the carrier protein while the carboxyl group comes from the hapten. The exact mechanism for this reaction is still unknown. However, two pathways are proposed. The first postulates that an intermediate that can react with an amine is formed. The second stating that a rearrangement of an acyl urea, the main side product of the reacction at high temperature, has occurred. #*Glutaraldehyde: This method works by the reaction between glutaraldehyde with amine groups to form Schiff bases or Michael-type double bond addition products. The yield of conjugates can be controlled by varying the pH of the reaction. Higher pH would give rise to more Schiff base intermediates and subsequently lead to the increase in hapten conjugates' number and size. Overall, cross-linkage involving glutaraldehyde is very stable. However, immunized animals tend to regconise glutaraldehyde's cross- linking bridges as epitopes. # High Performance Capillary Electrophoresis: High Performance Capillary Electrophoresis (HPCE) is an alternative method in optimizing hapten-protein conjugation. HPCE is predominantly used in separating carbohydrates with a very high separation capacity. There are numerous advantages to using HPCE as a technique to investigate certain conjugates such as only requiring minute sample sizes (nl). In addition, the sample used does not need to be pure and no type of radiolabeling is needed. A great benefit to this method of hapten conjugation is that there is automated analysis of sample and the testing of sample interactions can be determined in free solution. This method of hapten-protein conjugation is exceptionally effective with conjugates of low epitope densities, where it is otherwise very challenging by the use of other methods to determine their electrical or ionic mobility.Stratis-Cullum, D., McMasters, Sun, Pellegrino, Paul M, & U.S. Army Research Laboratory. (2009). Affinity probe capillary electrophoresis evaluation of aptamer binding to Campylobacter jejuni bacteria(ARL-TR (Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md.); 5015). Adelphi, MD: Army Research Laboratory. Hapten inhibition Hapten inhibition or \\"semi-hapten\\" is the inhibition of a type III hypersensitivity response. In inhibition, free hapten molecules bind with antibodies toward that molecule without causing the immune response, leaving fewer antibodies left to bind to the immunogenic hapten-protein adduct. An example of a hapten inhibitor is dextran 1, which is a small fraction (1 kilodalton) of the entire dextran complex, which is enough to bind anti-dextran antibodies, but insufficient to result in the formation of immune complexes and resultant immune responses.Promiten, drug information from the Swedish official drug catalog Last updated: 2005-02-17 See also *Toxin *Antigen References External links * Category:Immune system ","title":"Hapten"},{"id":"555025","text":"Carolina bays are elliptical depressions concentrated along the Atlantic seaboard within coastal Delaware, Maryland, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, and north Florida.Kaczorowski, R.

Within the Delmarva Peninsula, they and other coastal ponds are also called Delmarva bays.Coleman, D. (2001) Delmarva Bays: Natural Enigmas. Maryland Department of Natural Resources , Annapolis. Maryland. Geomorphology  Carolina bays vary in size from one to several thousand acres. About 500,000 of them are present in the classic area of the Atlantic Coastal Plain, often in groups aligned in a northwest-southeast direction. Generally the southeastern end has a higher rim composed of white sand. =Orientation= According to published papers and monographs,Johnson, D. W. (1942). The Origin of the Carolina Bays. New York: Columbia University Press. the orientation of the long axes of Carolina bays systematically rotate northward along the Atlantic Coastal Plain from northern Georgia to northern Virginia; the average trend of the long axes of Carolina Bays varies from N16¬∞W in east-central Georgia to N22¬∞W in southern South Carolina, N39¬∞W in northern South Carolina, N49¬∞W in North Carolina, and N64¬∞W in Virginia. Within this part of the Atlantic Coastal Plain, the orientation of the long axes of Carolina bays varies by 10 to 15 degrees. If the long axes of these Carolina bays, as measured by Johnson (1942), are projected westward, then they converge, neither in the Great Lakes nor Canada, but in the area of southeastern Indiana and southwestern Ohio. At the northern end of the distribution of Carolina bays within the Delmarva Peninsula and New Jersey, the average orientation of the long axes abruptly shifts by about 112 degrees to N48¬∞E. Further north, the orientation of the long axes becomes, at best, distinctly bimodal, and exhibits two greatly divergent directions and, at worst, completely random and lacking any preferred direction.

LIDAR elevation image of of Carolina bays in Robeson County, N.C. Stratigraphic setting  Most Carolina bays consist of a few meters of sand and (or) mud that rest on a unconformity above a harder substrate that does not show signs of deformation or other disturbance. The composition and the age of this harder substrate varies from location to location. Furthermore, stratigraphic relations of some Carolina bays with fields of eolian dunes in river valleys suggest that Carolina bays formed episodically during different times at different places. For example: :In some places, Carolina bays are inset into fields of eolian dunes in river valleys, and thus these Carolina bays must be younger than the underlying eolian dunes. One such example is Dukes Pond, which is a Carolina bay that is inset into eolian dunes in the valley of the Ohoopee River (Tattnall County, Georgia). These eolian dunes have yielded an optically stimulated luminescence date of ~23,600 years, and thus this Carolina Bay must be younger than this OSL date. Another example is Bear Swamp, which is a Carolina bay that is inset into eolian dunes in the valley of the Great Pee Dee River (Marion County, South Carolina). :In other places, Carolina bays are overlain by eolian dunes that are now vegetated, and thus these Carolina bays must be older than the overlying eolian dunes. One such example is Big Bay, which is a Carolina bay that is overlain by eolian dunes in the valley of the Wateree River (Sumter County, South Carolina). These eolian sand dunes at Big Bay have been dated by optically stimulated luminescence techniques at 29,600 ¬± 2,400 to 33,200 ¬± 2,800 BP, and thus this Carolina bay must be older than these dates. Stratigraphy within the Carolina bays and sand ridges Cores taken within several Carolina bays have revealed a stratigraphy of a few meters of sand and (or) mud resting on a unconformity above a harder substrate. Carolina bays for which the stratigraphy has been described in some detail include Lake Mattamuskeet (Hyde County, North Carolina), Wilson's Bay (Johnston County, North Carolina), Herndon Bay (Robeson County, North Carolina), Big Bay (Sumter County, South Carolina), Flamingo Bay (Aiken County, South Carolina), and Duke's Pond (Tattnall County, Georgia). Lake Mattamuskeet (Hyde County, North Carolina): Cores from within this Carolina bay revealed a 0.3-1.2 m thick unit of sand and silty sand (lacustrine deposits and paleosols) that rests on an unconformity above an undisturbed unit of gray clay and sandy clay (with marine shells and burrows) of Pleistocene age. Cores from the adjacent sand rims revealed a 2.6-2.9 m thick unit of silt, sand silt, and silty sand (interpreted as paleosols, shoreline, loess, and eolian deposits) that rests on an unconformity above an undisturbed unit of gray clay and sandy clay (with marine shells and burrows) of Pleistocene age (the same unit that was encountered in cores from within the Carolina bay). Charcoal and wood from a western sand rim (closer to the bay) yielded radiocarbon ages of ~5,760 and 1,270 years before present (BP). Organic sediment and charcoal from an eastern sand rim (farther from the bay) yielded radiocarbon ages ranging from ~7,750 to 2,780 years BP. Wilson's Bay (Johnston County, North Carolina): Cores and augers from within this Carolina bay revealed a 1.5-3.2 m thick unit of sand, sandy silt, and silty sand (lacustrine deposits) that rests on an unconformity above an undisturbed unit of saprolite (weathered felsic gneiss). These lacustrine deposits yielded a radiocarbon age of ~21,920 years BP. Cores and augers from the adjacent sand rims revealed a 1.5-4.0 m thick unit of muddy sand, sand, and gravel that rests on an unconformity above an undisturbed unit of saprolite/weathered felsic gneiss (the same unit that was encountered in cores from within the Carolina bay). Organic material within the bay yielded an age of ~21,920 radiocarbon years BP. Herndon Bay (Robeson County, North Carolina): Cores drilled into four different sand ridges associated with this Carolina bay revealed that the sand ridges are composed of 2.5-4.5 m thick accumulations of fine to coarse sand that rest on an unconformity above an undisturbed unit of black mud of Cretaceous age (Black Creek Formation). Sediment samples from sand rims associated with this Carolina bay have yielded three optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages of ~36,700 years ago; ~29,600 years ago; and ~27,200 years ago. Big Bay (Big Bay, Sumter County, South Carolina): A core (drill hole D1/2) drilled within this Carolina bay went through the following units: (1) Drilling depth 0 to 4.5 m = eolian sand sheet that overlies the Carolina bay; (2) Drilling depth 4.5 to 9.0 m = silty sand and sandy mud with abundant organic material; and (3) Drilling depth 9.0 to 10.6 m = sandy clay of Pliocene age (Duplin Formation). Sediment samples from sand rims associated with this Carolina bay have yielded four optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages of ~35,700 years ago; ~25,200 years ago; ~11,200 years ago; and ~2,100 years ago. Within cores of undisturbed sediments recovered from Big Bay, North Carolina, Brook and others documented well- defined pollen zones consisting of distinct pollen assemblages. They found a stratigraphically consistent series of pollen zones, which increased in age consistently with depth from Holocene Stage to the Wisconsin Stage, back into marine isotope stage 5 Flamingo Bay (Aiken County, South Carolina): A core (C1) taken within this Carolina bay revealed an 0.94 m thick unit of quartz sand that rests on an unconformity (paleosol) above an undisturbed unit of sandy silt and clay of Eocene age. Charcoal samples within the 0.94 m thick unit of quartz sand yielded radiocarbon ages of ~4,500 to 2,500 years BP. A core (P25) taken from adjacent sand rim revealed a 1.85 m thick unit of Quaternary sand that rests on an unconformity (paleosol) above an undisturbed unit of sandy silt and clay of Eocene age (the same unit that was encountered in core C1 from within the Carolina bay). Moore et al. (2012) reported that sediment samples from sand ridges associated with this Carolina bay have yielded five OSL ages of ~15,000 years ago; ~13,100 years ago; ~11,500 years ago; ~9,200 years ago; and ~5,000 years ago. Brooks et al. (2010) reported that sediment samples from sand ridges associated with this Carolina Bay yielded OSL ages of ~108,700 years ago; and ~40,300 years ago. Duke's Pond (Tattnall County, Georgia): A sediment sample from a sand rim at the margin of this Carolina has yielded an OSL age of ~23,600 years ago. Basal peat bog sediment within this Carolina bay yielded an age of ~8,600 radiocarbon years ago. =Additional notes on stratigraphy= In a study of several Carolina bays in North Carolina, Gamble et al. (1977) stated that drilling and coring indicated that the bedding and sediments underlying Carolina bays are undisturbed.Gamble EE, Daniels RB, Wheeler WH (1977), Primary and secondary rims of Carolina Bays: Southeastern Geology, v. 18, p. 199-212. Studies by Frey, Watts, and Whitehead have also documented that the sediments filling Carolina bays are generally undisturbed. Several cores have found that the sediments that fill Carolina bays have distinct and conformably layers or beds. The dating of the sand rims of a number of Carolina bays by optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) techniques has yielded ages ranging from ~109,000 to ~2,000 years ago, but most ages from the sand rims range from ~40,000 to ~11,000 years ago.Savannah River Archaeological Research Program Staff (2010) Annual review of Cultural Resource Investigations by Savannah River Archaeological Research Program. South Carolina Institute of Archaeology and Anthropology, Columbia, South Carolina. Radiocarbon dates have been obtained from organic matter collected from the undisturbed sediments filling Carolina bays by Bliley and Burney, Mixon and Pilkey,Mixon, R. B., and O. H. Pilkey, 1976, Reconnaissance geology of the submerged and emerged Coastal Plain province, Cape Lookout area, North Carolina. Professional Paper no. 859, U. S. Geological Survey, Reston, Virginia. Thom, and Kaczorowski. Some radiocarbon dates obtained from organic matter within undisturbed sediments are greater than 14,000 BP radiocarbon in age. The radiocarbon dates range from 27,700 ¬±2,600 to 440 ¬± 50 radiocarbon years BP. Some cores have contained organic matter that was too old for dating by radiocarbon methods, resulting in \\"greater than\\" dates. For example, samples from some Carolina bays have been dated at greater than 38,000 to 49,550 radiocarbon years BP. In cases where multiple radiocarbon dates have been determined from a single core, most radiocarbon dates are typically consistent in terms of their stratigraphic position within a core, and accumulation rates calculated from them only are rarely anomalous. Given the nature of radiocarbon dating, discordant dates occasionally occur even in undisturbed deposits, when multiple samples were dated. The occasional discordant dates by themselves are meaningless as an indicator of disturbance. The intact internal stratigraphy of the Carolina bay sediments, as indicated by paleosols and pollen zones (e.g. Big Bay) refutes such arguments. As discussed by Gaiser, radiocarbon dates reported from any Carolina bay are minimum dates for their formation. The radiocarbon dates only represent times during which organic matter accumulated and was preserved in Carolina bays. At other times, datable organic matter either might not have been preserved as sediment accumulated within them, or older organic matter might have been destroyed when the bays dried out. During times when the water table was below the bottom of a Carolina bay (e.g., possibly during glacial periods when sea level was 130 meters (400 ft) below present), organic matter could have been destroyed by oxidization and weathering. Also, during such times, eolian processes could have eroded any existing sediments at the bottom of Carolina bays. There are some who suggest that the oldest radiocarbon date from a Carolina bay only indicates the time when the water table rose high enough for a permanent lake or swamp to exist within it. This interpretation, however, may depend upon the nature of the overlying sediment. For example, eolian processes can bury and preserve organic matter, and thus the preservation of organic matter can occur independently of water table behavior. Ecological significance and biodiversity Woods Bay State Park, South Carolina, winter twilight The bays have many different vegetative structures, based on the depression depth, size, hydrology, and subsurface. Many are marshy; a few of the larger ones are (or were before drainage) lakes; Lake Waccamaw is an undrained example. Some bays are predominantly open water with large scattered pond cypress, while others are composed of thick, shrubby areas (pocosins), with vegetation growing on floating peat mats. The bays are especially rich in biodiversity, including some rare and/or endangered species. Species that thrive in the bays' habitats include birds, such as wood storks, herons, egrets, and other migratory waterfowl, mammals such as deer, black bears, raccoons, skunks, and opossums. Other residents include dragonflies, green anoles and green tree frogs. The bays contain trees such as black gum, bald cypress, pond cypress, sweet bay, loblolly bay, red bay, sweet gum, maple, magnolia, pond pine, and shrubs such as fetterbush, clethra, sumac, button bush, zenobia, and gallberry. Plants common in Carolina bays are water lilies, sedges and various grasses. Several carnivorous plants inhabit Carolina bays, including bladderwort, butterwort, pitcher plant, and sundew. Some of the bays have been greatly modified within human history, under pressure from farming, highway building, housing developments and golf courses. Carvers Bay, a large one in Georgetown County was used as a bombing practice range during World War II. It has been drained and is mostly used for tree farming today. Others are used for vegetable or field crops with drainage. A study of bays located on the Delmarva peninsula estimated that 70% had been partially or fully converted to agriculture. In South Carolina, Woods Bay, on the Sumter-Florence county line near Olanta has been designated a state park to preserve it as much as possible in its natural state. Also in Clarendon County (near Manning), another bay, Bennett's Bay, is a Heritage Preserve. Another bay in Bamberg County, South Carolina is owned by the South Carolina Native Plant Society, which has been developing a preserve called the Lisa Matthews Memorial Bay, which is trying to preserve and increase the federally endangered wildflower Oxypolis canbyi (Canby's Dropwort) in the bay. The uplands area surrounding the bay is being restored from a loblolly pine plantation to the original longleaf pine. Included in the longleaf restoration is the restoration of wiregrass (Aristida beyrichiana) as a key understory plant. Its flammability aids in periodic burning, which is necessary for Canby's Dropwort and many of the other species unique to the environment. Theories of origin More than a dozen bays are shown in this photo in southeastern North Carolina. Several are cleared and drained for farming. Most geologists today interpret the Carolina bays as relict geomorphological features that developed via various eolian and lacustrine processes. Furthermore, multiple lines of evidence, e.g. radiocarbon dating, optically stimulated luminescence dating, and palynology, indicate that the Carolina bays predate the start of the Holocene. Fossil pollen recovered from cores of undisturbed sediment taken from various Carolina bays in North Carolina by Frey, Watts, and Whitehead document the presence of full glacial pollen zones within the sediments filling some Carolina bays. The range of dates can be interpreted that they were either created episodically over the last tens of thousands of years or were created at time over a hundred thousand years ago and have since been episodically modified. =Relict thermokarst lakes= Recent work by the U.S. Geological Survey has interpreted the Carolina bays as relict thermokarst lakes that have been modified by eolian and lacustrine processes. Modern thermokarst lakes are common today around Barrow (Alaska), and the long axes of the lakes are oblique to the prevailing wind direction. These lakes develop by thawing of frozen ground, with subsequent modification by wind and waves. Thus, the interpretation of Carolina Bays as relict thermokarst lakes implies that frozen ground once extended as far south as the Carolina bays. This interpretation is consistent with the optically stimulated luminescence dates, which suggest that the Carolina bays are relict features that formed when the climate was colder, drier, and windier. Quaternary geologists and geomorphologists argue that the features of the Carolina bays can be readily explained by known terrestrial processes and repeated modification by eolian and lacustrine processes. Also, Quaternary geologists and geomorphologists have found a correspondence in time between when the active modification of the rims of Carolina bays most commonly occurred and when adjacent sand dunes were active during the Wisconsin glaciation between 15,000 and 40,000 years (Late Wisconsin) and 70,000 to 80,000 years BP (Early Wisconsin). In addition, Quaternary geologists and geomorphologists have found that the orientations of the Carolina bays are consistent with the wind patterns that existed during the Wisconsin glaciation, as reconstructed from the orientations of parabolic dunes in river valleys.Swezey, C.S. (2020) \\"Quaternary eolian dunes and sand sheets in inland locations of the Atlantic Coastal Plain Province\\", in Inland Dunes of North America (N. Lancaster and P. Hesp, eds.), Springer Publishing, Switzerland, pp. 11-63. Within the Atlantic Coast Plain, the orientation of the long axes of Carolina bays and the inferred direction of movement of adjacent sand dunes, where present, are generally oblique to each other. In southern Georgia and northern Florida, the orientation is matched by an inferred west to east direction of movement of Pleistocene sand dunes.Markewich, H. W., and W. Markewich (1994) An overview of Pleistocene and Holocene inland dunes in Georgia and the Carolinas; morphology, distribution, age, and paleoclimate. Bulletin no. 206, United States Geological Survey, Reston, Virginia. Northward from northern Georgia to Virginia, the average inferred direction of movement of Pleistocene parabolic sand dunes systematically shifts along with the average orientation of the long axes of Carolina bays as to lie oblique to them. In the Delmarva Peninsula, the 112 degree shift in the average trend of the long axes also corresponds with a shift in the average inferred direction of movement of Pleistocene parabolic sand dunes such that their direction of movement is also oblique to the long axes, as is the case in the rest of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. =Alternative interpretations= Alternative interpretations of Carolina bays that are no longer viewed favorably by most geologists include: #the action of sea currents when the area was under the ocean; #the upwelling of ground water at a later time; #the formation of siliciclastic karst by solution of subsurface material during glacial sealevel lowstands; #extraterrestrial impact hypotheses: Comet or meteorite impact hypotheses were popular during the 1940s and 1950s. However, geologists later determined the depressions are too shallow and that they lack evidence for them to be impact features. Reports of magnetic anomalies do not show consistency across the sites, and there are no meteorite fragments, shatter cones, or planar deformation features. None of the necessary evidence for impacts is present, and comet or meteorite impact hypotheses have been rejected. Nevertheless, a extraterrestrial impact origin of Carolina bays was proposed again in association with the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis and the theory that the Carolina bays were created by a low density comet exploding above or impacting on the Laurentide Ice Sheet about 12,900 years ago. However, this theory has been discredited by OSL dating of the rims of the Carolina bays, paleoenvironmental records obtained from cores of Carolina bay sediments, and other research related to the Laurentide Ice Sheet.Schaetzl, J.R., Sauck, W., Heinrich, P.V., Colgan, P.M., and Holliday, V.T., 2019, Commentary on Klokocnik, J., Kostelecky, and Bezdek, A. 2019, The putative Saginaw impact structure, Michigan, Lake Huron, in light of gravity aspects derived from recent EIGEN 6C4 gravity field model. Journal of Great Lakes Research 45:12-20: Journal of Great Lakes Research, v. 45, p. 1003-1006. Fine-scale scrutiny of radiocarbon data does not support synchroneity of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.Jorgeson, I.A., Breslawski, R.P., and Fisher, A.E., 2020, Radiocarbon simulation fails to support the temporal synchroneity requirement of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis: Quaternary Research, v. 96, p. 123-139 Similar landforms in the Gulf of Mexico coastal plain Other landform depressions, not widely accepted as Carolina bays, are present within the northern Gulf of Mexico coastal plain in southern Mississippi and Alabama, where they are known as either Grady ponds or Citronelle ponds.Bernard, H.A., and Leblanc, R.J., 1965, Resume of the Quaternary geology of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico province, in: The Quaternary of the United States (H.E. Wright, Jr., and D.G. Frey, eds.), Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, p. 137-185. They are also known by a variety of names such as pocks, pock marks, , lacs ronds, and natural ponds. These features in southern Mississippi and Alabama are elliptical to roughly circular in shape. The measurement of the long axes of 200 elliptical Grady / Citronelle ponds in southwestern Baldwin County, Alabama found a very distinct orientation tightly clustered about N25¬∞W. Undrained depressions, circular-to-oval in shape and exhibiting a wide range of area and depth, are also a feature of the Gulf of Mexico coastal plain in Texas and southwest Louisiana. These depressions vary in size from in diameter. Within Harris County, Texas, raised rims, which are about high, partially enclose these depressions.Aronow, S., nda, A Digression on the origin of some anomalous undrained depressions mostly on the Pleistocene and Pliocene surfaces in the Gulf of Mexico PDF version, 48 KB Armand Bayou Watershed Working Group, The Texas Coastal Watershed Program, Houston Texas.Aronow, S., ndb, Geomorphology and surface geology of Harris County and Adjacent parts of Brazoria, Fort Bend, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller Counties, Texas PDF version, 68 KB Armand Bayou Watershed Working Group, The Texas Coastal Watershed Program, Houston Texas.

Its high acidity means it can be used to make everything from sparkling wines to well-balanced dessert wines, although it can produce very bland, neutral wines if the vine's natural vigor is not controlled. Outside the Loire it is found in most of the New World wine regions; it is the most widely planted variety in South Africa, where it was historically also known as Steen. The grape may have been one of the first to be grown in South Africa by Jan van Riebeeck in 1655, or it may have come to that country with Huguenots fleeing France after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Chenin blanc was often misidentified in Australia as well, so tracing its early history in the country is not easy. It may have been introduced in James Busby's collection of 1832, but C. Waterhouse was growing Steen at Highercombe in Houghton, South Australia, by 1862. It provides a fairly neutral palate for the expression of terroir, vintage variation and the winemaker's treatment.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 75-83 Harcourt Books 2001 In cool areas the juice is sweet but high in acid with a full-bodied fruity palate. In the unreliable summers of northern France, the acidity of under ripened grapes was often masked with chaptalization with unsatisfactory results, whereas now the less ripe grapes are made into popular sparkling wines such as Cr√©mant de Loire. The white wines of the Anjou AOC are a popular expression of Chenin as a dry wine, with flavors of quince and apples. In nearby Vouvray AOC they aim for an off-dry style, developing honey and floral characteristics with age. In the best vintages the grapes can be left on the vines to develop noble rot, producing an intense, viscous dessert wine which may improve considerably with age. History The writings of the French writer Fran√ßois Rabelais indicate that Chenin blanc was a major grape in the Loire by the 16th century The French ampelographer Pierre Galet has theorized that Chenin blanc originated in the Anjou wine region sometime in the 9th century and from there traveled to Touraine by at least the 15th century. The grape may have been the variety described in two royal land grants of Charles the Bald in 845 detailed in the records of the abbey of Glanfeuil as growing on the left bank of the Loire river in vineyards belonging to individuals with the name of Soulang√© and Bess√©.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 82, 236-238 Allen Lane 2012 When Thomas Bohier purchased vineyard land around Chenonceaux on January 3, 1496, several grape varieties were brought in from the Burgundy wine region of Beaune, the Jura wine region of Arbois and nearby Orl√©ans and Anjou. One of these varieties, a white grape known as Plant d'Anjou was later planted between 1520 and 1535 at a nearby site known as Mont Chenin in Touraine by the Lord of Ch√¢teau de Chenonceau and his brother in law, Denis Bri√ßonnet, the abbot of Cormery. Ampelographers believe that Plant d'Anjou was like Chenin blanc with the grape eventually taking on the name from Mont Chenin. The French writer Fran√ßois Rabelais (1494‚Äì1553) wrote glowingly about the white wines of Anjou, and mentions the medicinal qualities of the grapes at the end of chapter XXV of Gargantua: > This done, the shepherds and shepherdesses made merry with these cakes and > fine grapes, and sported themselves together at the sound of the pretty > small pipe, scoffing and laughing at those vainglorious cake-bakers, who had > that day met with a mischief for want of crossing themselves with a good > hand in the morning. Nor did they forget to apply to Forgier's leg some fat > chenin grapes, and so handsomely dressed it and bound it up that he was > quickly cured.Translation based on that of Gustave Dor√© (1894) at Project > Gutenberg of the following French :Ce faict, et bergiers et bergieres > feirent chere lye avecques ces fouaces et beaulx raisins, et se rigollerent > ensemble au son de la belle bouzine, se mocquans de ces beaulx fouaciers > glorieux, qui avoient trouv√© male encontre par faulte de s'estre seignez de > la bonne main au matin, et avec gros raisins chenins estuverent les jambes > de Forgier mignonnement, si bien qu'il feut tantost guery. From France the grape spread to South Africa where it was most likely included among the vine cuttings sent to Jan van Riebeeck in the Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company. In the 20th century it was discovered that a sub- variety of Chenin planted in the Loire was not actually Chenin blanc at all but rather the grape Verdelho, which is banned from French AOC regulations in the Loire. =Relationship to other grapes= In 1999, DNA analysis has shown that Chenin blanc has a parent-offspring relationship with the Jura wine grape Savagnin. Additional DNA evidence shows that Chenin blanc shares a sibling relationship with Trousseau and Sauvignon blanc (both grapes the likely offspring of Savagnin) which strongly suggest that it is Chenin blanc that is the offspring and Savagnin is the parent variety. Through Chenin's half- sibling relationship with Sauvignon blanc, the grape is related as an aunt/uncle variety to the Bordeaux wine grape Cabernet Sauvignon which is the offspring of Sauvignon blanc and Cabernet Franc. Other DNA research has shown that a crossing of Chenin and the Hunnic grape Gouais blanc produced several varieties including Balzac blanc, Colombard and Meslier-Saint-Fran√ßois. In South Africa, the grape was crossed with the Italian wine grape Trebbiano to produce Weldra and Chenel. Over the years, Chenin blanc has also been frequently confused with other grape varieties with whom it does not seem to have a close genetic relationship. This includes the Portuguese wine grape Verdelho grown on the island of Madeira Machupiclait and in the Azores as well as the Spanish wine grape Albillo which was confused for Chenin blanc in Australia. Viticulture Chenin blanc grapes, like these Sauvignon blanc grapes pictured, are highly sensitive to developing noble rot which produces a unique style of wine. The Chenin blanc grapevine buds early in the growing season and ripens mid to late in the harvest year. However, in warm years, the balance between the Loire's marginal climate and the warmth needed to attain full ripeness has the potential of producing wines with some depth of complexity and finesse. The age of the vine can have an influence on wine quality, with older vines producing naturally lower yields. When infected by noble rot, which also lowers yields and adds and intensifies certain flavors, the wines develop less overtly floral aroma notes but more depth and layers. New clonal varieties have been developed that delay budding and increase sugar development during the ripening phase. Six of these new clones have been officially sanctioned by the French government. The vine is semi-upright in habit with 3-5 lobed leaves. It tends to break bud early, with conical, winged bunches containing yellow-green grapes that ripen late. The berries are typically 16.0 mm long x 14.2 mm wide, with an average weight of 1.79g. The climate of a wine region will largely dictate whether Chenin blanc is produced in a predominately sweet or dry manner, while the vineyard soil type will generally influence the overall style of the wine. Heavy clay based soils, paired with the right climate, is favorable to the development of weighty, botrytized dessert wines that need time to age and mature. Well-drained and less organic, predominately sandy soils tend to produce lighter styles of wine that mature more quickly. Chenin blanc planted in soils with a high silex content will produce wines with distinctive minerally notes, while limestone based soils will encourage wines with sharp acidity. In Vouvray the soil is predominately argilo-calcaire or calcareous clay, which produces rounded wines with both acidity and weight. In areas where schist is plentiful in the soil, Chenin blanc grapes will generally ripen earlier than in vineyards with predominately clay based soils. Among the viticultural hazards to which Chenin is susceptible (apart from botrytis in less than ideal conditions) are damage from spring time frost, powdery mildew, and fungal disease (such as Dead arm of grapevine) that affect the wood structures of the grape vine. Some of these hazards can be managed with integrated pest management and rootstock selection.J.H.S. Ferreira \\"Effect of Rootstock on the Incidence of Dying Arm of Chenin blanc vines\\" Viticultural and Oenological Research Institute, Stellenbosch, Republic of South Africa. March, 1985 =Yields and harvest times= Producers will often harvest Chenin blanc by hand in a succession of pickings known as tries. The grapes may be harvested as whole clusters or individual berries. While true for most wine grape varieties, the quality of Chenin blanc wine is intimately connected to the care taken in the vineyard. If the grapes are harvested too soon, before they ripen, the high acidity of the resulting wine will be (according to wine expert Oz Clarke) \\"one of the nastiest wines possible\\". If the grapes are harvested at too high of a yield, the grapes will not retain any of Chenin blanc's distinctive character notes. In the Loire, French regulations mandate that yields be kept low (40-50 hl/ha). At these levels, more of Chenin blanc's varietal characteristics of floral, honeyed aromas are exhibited. When the grape is harvested at high yields, such as the California Central Valley average of 10 tons per acre (175 hl/ha), Chenin's flavors become more bland and neutral. The vine is naturally vigorous and prone to overcropping if not kept in check. In fertile soils, as in parts of South Africa, Chenin blanc can easily produce yields of 240 hl/ha. To keep yields in check, vineyard managers may choose to graft Chenin vines with less vigorous rootstock from Vitis riparia or Vitis rupestris vines. During the growing season, they may also elect to do a green harvest where excess grape clusters are removed. With optimal ripeness and balance between acidity and sugars being such a viticultural priority for Chenin blanc, many growers (such as those in the Loire Valley) will harvest the grapes in tries or successive pickings through the vineyards. During each series of picking only the ripest clusters or individual grapes are harvested by hand during a period that could last four to six weeks and include three to six passes through the vineyard. For the production of sweet botrytized wines, pickers will look for the grapes that have achieved the necessary amount of the noble rot. In hot and dry years where no noble rot occurs, pickers may leave ripened grapes on the vine long enough to shrivel, or passerill√©, where it could later be effected by noble rot. In areas that experience a lot of vintage variation, winemakers may decide on a day by day basis what style and dryness of Chenin blanc they could make, with the grapes harvested during each tries going to different styles of wine. For some producers in Vouvray, which may have up to six tries during harvest, the first few tries could go to sparkling and dry wine production while the later tries could go towards sweet wine production. Wine regions While Chenin blanc is planted across the globe from China to New Zealand, Canada, and Argentina, it is considered a \\"major\\" planting in only a few locations. Though France is the viticultural home of Chenin blanc, by the turn of the 21st century there was twice as much Chenin blanc planted in South Africa as there was in France. The grape's versatility and ability to reflect terroir causes it to lead, what Jancis Robinson describes as, a \\"double life\\". In the Loire Valley of France, it is prized as a premium quality wine grape able to produce world class wines, while in many New World wine regions it used as a \\"workhorse variety\\", contributing acidity to bulk white blends and showing more neutral flavors rather than terroir. Throughout all its manifestations, Chenin blanc's characteristic acidity is found almost universally in all wine regions. =France= Chenin blanc can be made in a variety of styles, such as this sparkling wine from Vouvray. Ampelographers theorize that Chenin blanc originated in the Loire Valley of France sometime in the 9th century. Today the Loire is the French wine region most closely associated with the variety. In 2008 there were of Chenin planted in France, mostly in the Indre-et-Loire, Loir-et-Cher and Maine-et-Loire department with the Anjou region around the city of Angers in the Maine-et-Loire having the most significant plantings with in 2008. While Chenin blanc still accounts for around 1.2% of all French plantings, these numbers are significant drop from the of grapevines that was in cultivation in 1958. Chenin blanc is an authorized planting in many Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) regions but is mostly planted in the Middle Loire AOCs of Anjou, Bonnezeaux, Cr√©mant de Loire, Coteaux de l'Aubance, Coteaux du Layon, Jasni√®res, Montlouis, Quarts de Chaume, Saumur, Savenni√®res, and Vouvray. The wines of the Coteaux du Layon, Bonnezeaux, and Quarts de Chaume are produced as sweet dessert wines, while Savenni√®res produce predominately dry wines. The wines of Anjou, Cr√©mant de Loire, Coteaux de l'Aubance, Jasni√®res, Montlouis, Saumur, and Vouvray have a wide range of sweetness levels, from dry to semi-sweet to sweet. In the 1970s, plantings of Chenin blanc in the Loire were uprooted in favor of the more fashionable red Cabernet Franc and white Sauvignon blanc as well as the easier-to-grow Gamay. This consolidated Chenin's presence to the Middle Loire region around Anjou-Saumur and Touraine. In the 1980s, interest in the sweet dessert wines of the Loire renewed enthusiasm for Chenin blanc in the region. During this time the Bordeaux wine region of Sauternes had experienced a series of favorable vintages that saw a dramatic increase in prices as supply began to dwindle in face of high demand. Wine consumers who had developed an appreciation for these sweet wines began to look to the Loire as another source. The 1990s brought a string successful vintages to the Middle Loire that produced many highly rated Chenin wines affected by noble rot. As wine expert Oz Clarke noted, these wines became the \\"standard-bearer\\" for Chenin blanc. The climate of the wine region tends to dictate what style of Chenin blanc is most prevalent in the area. In the northernmost reaches of Jasni√®res, Chenin blanc is at its limits for cultivation with the wines being mostly dry and thin. While most of the Middle Loire experiences a continental climate, the Coteaux du Layon receives more climatic influence from the Atlantic Ocean, which promotes the development of Botrytis cinerea, than in nearby Vouvray or Montlouis. While all three AOCs produce sweet, botrytized wine there tends to be less vintage variation in the Coteaux du Layon. The cool continental influence in Montlouis and Vouvray lends itself to producing a wide range of Chenin blanc including grapes with the necessary balance of acidity to sugar needed to produce sparkling wine. In the AOC of Savenni√®res, there is less fog and mist from the nearby rivers and more wind that makes it difficult for botrytis to take root. This is part of the reason why Savenni√®res is the one Loire AOC that produces predominately dry Chenin blanc. In the south of France, the warm Mediterranean climate of the Languedoc region encourages the production of much more dry styles of Chenin blanc rather than sweet. Other wine styles and French Chenins A cluster of Chenin blanc grapes. While most Chenin blanc is produced as a varietal wine, up to 20% of Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc are permitted in wines with the basic Anjou, Saumur, and Touraine designations. The high acidity of Chenin blanc lends itself well to sparkling wine production where it is an important component of Cr√©mant de Loire, sparkling Vouvray, and in the Languedoc wine region of Limoux. In Cr√©mant de Limoux, Chenin must account for at least 20% and up to 40% of the blend with Mauzac, Pinot noir and Chardonnay. The grape is also permitted in the still wines of Limoux but is only blended with Mauzac and Chardonnay. Outside the Loire, in addition to the Languedoc plantings in Limoux, other French plantings of Chenin blanc can be found in Corsica (with planted on the island in 2008), Charentes, and the Aveyron department. In South West France, it is permitted to be used in the white wines of the C√¥tes de Duras and the Garonne wines of Vins d'Estaing and Vins d'Entraygues et du Fel. =South Africa= South African Chenin blancs tend to emphasize more tropical fruit flavors than their Loire counterparts. In South Africa, Chenin blanc is the most widely planted variety, accounting for nearly one-fifth (18.6%) of all vineyard plantings in the early 21st century. In 2008, there were of the grape planted, nearly twice the amount of Chenin blanc planted in France. The majority of the plantings are found in the Western Cape wine region of Paarl in the Cape Winelands District Municipality with with the Swartland region of Malmesbury and Olifants River not far behind with and , respectively, in cultivation in 2008. The variety was most likely introduced to the country in the collection of vine cuttings sent to Jan van Riebeeck by the Dutch East India Company. For the next couple hundred years of South African wine history, the variety was known as Steen. It was not until 1965 that ampelographers were able to concretely identify the numerous plantings of Steen around the country as being Chenin blanc. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Chenin blanc was the principal grape in the South African wine industry's \\"white wine renaissance\\" that was ushered in by the introduction of new technologies such as temperature controlled fermentation vessels. During this time, the focus was on producing off-dry, clean, and crisp wine that was mostly neutral in flavor and could capitalize on the wine market's demand for white wine. Near the end of the 20th century, several Chenin blanc specialist producers emerged and worked with vineyard managers to isolate older Chenin vines on suitable terroir. Their goal was to produce wines that exhibited Chenin's unique aromas and traits. While plantings of Chenin blanc have decreased, the work of these producers resulted in improved quality profiles of South African Chenin blanc. =United States= A Chenin blanc from Washington State. During the 1980s, the California wine industry had more acreage of Chenin blanc planted than France, though the numbers of plantings later steadily declined. By 2006, there were planted mostly in the hot Central Valley. In 2010, this number was down to . For most of its history in the California wine industry, the grape was considered a \\"workhorse variety\\" that could be used anonymously in bulk and jug wine blends. Chenin's natural acidity and ability to adapt to wines of varying degrees of sweetness made it an ideal blending partner with Colombard and Chardonnay in mass-produced blends. It wasn't till close to the turn of the 21st century that producers in Sacramento Valley's Clarksburg AVA started to make quality varietal Chenin blancs a specialty; Chenin blancs from these producers tend to show a characteristic musky melon aroma and have the potential to age well. While Chenin blanc is grown throughout the United States, the American Viticultural Areas with the most significant amount of plantings include the California AVAs of Clarksburg, Napa Valley, and Mendocino, the Washington wine regions of the Yakima and Columbia Valley, and the Texas High Plains AVA.Appellation American \\"Chenin blanc, Accessed: July 7th 2006 In 2012, Washington had of Chenin while Texas was growing . Other states in the United States with plantings of Chenin blanc include New York, Missouri, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Arizona, New Mexico, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, Idaho, Colorado and Texas. In 1990 there were of Chenin blanc planted in Oregon, but by 2001 virtually all of it had been uprooted with only a few isolated plantings remaining. =Other wine regions= In Australia, the country's of Chenin blanc is mostly grown as a blending variety often used with Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, and Semillon. Australian Chenin plantings can be found in Tasmania, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, as well as the Swan Valley and Margaret River area of Western Australia. Wine expert James Halliday describes the style of Australia Chenin blanc as \\"tutti-frutti\\" with pronounced fruit salad notes. However, the wines produced in Western Australia have garnered more critical attention. In 2008, there were of Chenin blanc in cultivation in Australia. In New Zealand, acreage of the variety fell to just under by 2004. By 2008, that number had dropped to . Planted primarily on the North Island, some examples of New Zealand Chenin blanc have drawn favorable comparisons to the sweet dessert styles of Chenin from the Loire Valley. Historically the grape has been used as a blending partner with M√ºller-Thurgau in mass-produced blends. The success of some critically acclaimed New Zealand Chenin blancs has sparked interest in planting the variety. However, as experts such as Oz Clarke have noted, as long as the value of New Zealand Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc stays high, there is little economic reason to pursue premium Chenin blanc production. Chenin blanc is found planted throughout South America, though for many years plantings in Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay were confused for Pinot blanc. The grape was used primarily in mass-produced white blends. In Mexico, the grape is primarily found in Aguascalientes, Baja California and Coahuila. In 2008, Argentina had of Chenin blanc, most of it in the Mendoza wine region, while Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay had , , and of grapevines planted, respectively. The grape was exported to Israel in the 20th century, where it is still found in limited quantities. Canada has Chenin blanc planted in the Okanagan wine region of British Columbia and in Ontario. Some plantings of Chenin blanc can be found in the Spanish wine regions, mainly in Catalonia. In 2015, there were of the grape. However, this number may rise as DNA analysis in 2006 discovered the Agudelo grape variety growing in the Galicia, Alella and Pened√®s wine region is actually Chenin blanc. The tropical wine regions of India and Thailand also has some limited plantings of the grape. Winemaking and wine styles A South African (left) and Loire (right) Chenin blanc Wine expert Jancis Robinson has noted that Chenin blanc is probably the world's most versatile grape, being able to produce quality wines of various sweetness, including dessert wines noted for their aging ability, as well as sparkling made according to the m√©thode champenoise and fortified wines. The grape can distinguish itself as a single varietal wine, or it can add acidity as a blending component. Its ability to be crafted into premium quality wines across a wide spectrum of dry and sweetness levels invites the comparison to German Rieslings, with Robinson noting that in many ways Chenin blanc is France's answer to the German Riesling. One of the major differences between Old world and New world styles of Chenin blanc is the fermentation temperature. Old World style producers in the Loire tend to ferment their Chenin blanc at higher temperatures, 60-68 ¬∞F (16-20 ¬∞C), than New World producers in South Africa and elsewhere, usually fermenting their whites at temperatures around 50-54 ¬∞F (10-12 ¬∞C). This is because Old World wine producers tend not to put a premium on the tropical fruit flavors and aromas that come out more vividly with cooler fermentation temperatures. Chenin blanc can accommodate some skin contact and maceration which will allow extraction of phenolic compounds that could add to the complexity of the wine. Two of the aromas that skin contact can bring out is the characteristic greengage and angelica notes of Chenin. The grape's characteristic acidity can be softened by malolactic fermentation, which will give the wine a creamier or \\"fattier\\" texture as would a period spent aging on the lees. The use of wood or oak aging is up to each individual producer. Old World producers tend to shy away from the use of new oak barrels which can impart flavors of vanilla, spice, and toastiness; though these notes may be desirable for a New World producer. In Savenni√®res there is a tradition of using acacia and chestnut barrels for aging; though acacia can impart a yellow tint to the wine, and chestnut barrels may add some buttery notes. Wines The aroma of greengages are a common descriptor for Chenin blanc wines. The aromas and flavor notes of Chenin blanc often include the descriptors of minerally, greengage, angelica and honey. Chenin wines produced from noble rot will often have notes of peaches and honey that develop into barley sugar, marzipan, and quince as they age. Dry or semi-sweet Chenin blanc from the Loire will often have notes apple, greengage, and chalky minerals that develop into more honey, acacia, and quince aromas. New World styles of Chenin, such as those of South Africa, are more often made to be consume young and exhibit rich tropical fruit notes such as banana, guava, pear, and pineapple. The alcohol level for dessert styles Chenin rarely goes above 12%, which keeps the wines more in balance. Drier styles of Chenin are more likely to be around 13.5%. The aging ability of sweet Loire Chenin blanc is among the longest lived in the world of wine with well-made examples from favorable vintages regularly having the potential to last for at least 100 years. This longevity is attributed to the grape's naturally high acidity, which acts as a preservative. As phenolic compounds in the wine break down, they add complexity and depth to the wine. Some off dry or \\"demi-sec\\" examples may need at least 10 years before they start drinking at peak levels and could continue to develop for another 20 to 30 years. Sparkling and dry examples of Chenin blanc from premium production and favorable vintages have also shown longevity levels not commonly associated with white wine. However, as they age, Chenin blanc wines are prone to going through \\"dumb phases\\" where the wine closes up, revealing little aroma and varietal characteristics. Food pairings Chenin blanc can be a very versatile player in food and wine pairings, but the wide range of wine styles needs to be taken into account. Lighter, dry styles can pair well with light dishes such as salads, fish, and chicken. The sweeter styles of Chenin blanc can balance the spicy heat of some Asian and Hispanic cuisines. The acidity and balance of medium-dry styles can pair well with cream sauces and rich dishes like p√¢t√©. Synonyms Over the years, Chenin blanc has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Agudelo (in Spain), Agudillo (Spain), Anjou, Blanc d'Aunis, Blanc d‚ÄôAnjou, Capbreton blanc (Landes, France), Confort, Coue Fort, Cruchinet, Cugnette, Feher Chenin, Franc blanc (Aveyron, France), Franche, Gamet blanc (Aveyron, France), Gros Chenin (in Maine-et- Loire and Indre-et-Loire), Gros Pineau (in Touraine), Gros Pinot Blanc de la Loire, Gout Fort, Luarskoe, Pineau d'Anjou (in Mayenne), Pineau de Briollay, Pineau de la Loire (in Indre-et-Loire), Pineau de Savenni√®res, Pineau Gros, Pineau Gros de Vouvray, Pineau Nantais, Plant d‚ÄôAnjou (in Indre-et-Loire), Plant de Br√©z√©, Plant de Salces, Plant de Salles, Plant du Clair de Lune, Quefort, Rajoulin, Ronchalin, Rouchelein, Rouchelin (in Gironde and P√©rigord), Rouchalin, Rougelin, Steen (South Africa), Stein, T√™te de Crabe, Vaalblaar Stein and Verdurant.

It is usually responsible for a particular geographic area. An army group is the largest field organization handled by a single commander‚Äîusually a full general or field marshal‚Äîand it generally includes between 400,000 and 1,000,000 soldiers. In the Polish Armed Forces and former Soviet Red Army an army group was known as a Front. The equivalent of an army group in the Imperial Japanese Army was a \\"general army\\" (). Army groups may be multi-national formations. For example, during World War II, the Southern Group of Armies (also known as the U.S. 6th Army Group) comprised the U.S. Seventh Army and the French First Army; the 21st Army Group comprised the British Second Army, the Canadian First Army and the US Ninth Army. In both Commonwealth and U.S. usage, the number of an army group is expressed in Arabic numerals (e.g., \\"12th Army Group\\"), while the number of a field army is spelled out (e.g., \\"Third Army\\"). World War I =France= The French Army formed a number of during the First World War. * Army Group North, formed on a provisional basis in October 1914. * Army Group East, created in 1915 * Army Group Centre, created in 1915 * Army Group Reserve was established in 1917. * Army Group Flanders, created in September 1918 under the command of Albert I of Belgium, to conduct the Second Battle of Belgium as part of the Hundred Days Offensive. =Germany= The German Army formed its first two Heeresgruppen in 1915, to control forces on the eastern front. A total of eight army groups would ultimately be raised‚Äîfour for service on each front, with one of the eastern front army groups being a multinational German and Austro-Hungarian formation. Originally the Imperial German army groups were not separate formations, but instead additional responsibilities granted to certain army commanders. Crown Prince Wilhelm for instance, was simultaneously commander of the 5th Army and Army Group German Crown Prince from August 1915 to November 1916. All eight German army groups were named after their commanders.Die Deutschen Heeresgruppen im Ersten Weltkrieg, , accessed 4 december 20150 * Army Group Mackensen (Poland) (22 Apr 1915 - 8 Sep 1915) ** Army Group Linsingen (8 Sep 1915 - 31 Mar 1918) ** Army Group Eichhorn-Kiev (31 Mar 1918 - 30 Apr 1918) ** Army Group Eichhorn (30 Apr 1918 - 31 Jul 1918) ** Army Group Kiev (31 Jul 1918 - 3 Feb 1919) * Army Group Mackensen (Serbia) (18 Sep 1915 - 30 July 1916) ** Army Group Below (11 Oct 1916 - 21 Apr 1917) ** Army Group Scholtz (23 Apr 1917 - 6 Oct 1918) * Army Group Mackensen (Romania) (28 Aug 1916 - 7 May 1918) * Army Group Prince Leopold of Bavaria (5 Aug 1915 - 29 Aug 1916) ** Army Group Woyrsch (29 Aug 1916 - 15 Dec 1917) * Army Group Gallwitz (1916) (19 Jul 1916 - 28 Aug 1916) ** Army Group Rupprecht of Bavaria (A) (28 Aug 1916 - 11 Nov 1918) * Army Group German Crown Prince (B) (1 Aug 1915 - 11 Nov 1918) * Army Group Gallwitz (1918) (C) (1 Feb 1918 - 11 Nov 1918) *Army Group Duke Albrecht of W√ºrttemberg (D) (7 Mar 1917 - 11 Nov 1918) * Army Group Hindenburg (5 Aug 1915 - 30 Jul 1916) ** Army Group Eichhorn (30 Jul 1916 - 31 Mar 1918) ** Army Group Riga (31 Mar 1918 - 30 Apr 1918) * Army Group Boehn (12 Aug 1918 - 8 Oct 1918 ) * Army Group Yildirim (F) : part of the Ottoman Army. World War II =China= : : A Chinese \\"army group\\" was usually equivalent in numbers only to a field army in the terminology of other countries, as the regimental level was sometimes omitted. =Germany= :See Heeresgruppen and Armeegruppen The German Army was organized into army groups (Heeresgruppen). Some of these army groups included armies from several Axis countries. For example, Army Group Africa contained both German and Italian corps. A separate and distinct German military unit (:de:Armeegruppe), which is also translated to English as army group, describes more temporary groupings of army-sized units, where the command of one of its composite units formed the grouping's command structure. These groupings were usually named after the commander of the unit in question, for example Armeegruppe Weichs, part of Army Group B during Operation Blau in 1942. =Japan= During World War II there were six general armies: *Kant≈çgun (often known as the \\"Kwantung Army\\") originated as the division-level garrison of a Japanese colony in northeast China, in 1908; it remained in northern China until the end of World War II. The strength of the Kant≈çgun peaked at 700,000 personnel in 1941. It faced and was destroyed by Soviet forces in 1945. *Shina Hakengun, the \\"China Expeditionary Army\\", was formed in Nanjing, in September 1939, to control operations in central China. At the end of World War II, it consisted of 620,000 personnel in 25 infantry and one armored divisions. *Nanpo Gun was the \\"Southern Army\\", also known as the \\"Southern Expeditionary Army\\". By November 1941, war with the western Allies appeared likely and Nanpo Gun was formed in Saigon, French Indochina, to control Imperial Japanese Army operations in southern China, South Asia, South East Asia, and the South Pacific. In April 1945, the Boei So-Shireibu (translated as \\"general defense command\\" or \\"home defense general headquarters\\" and similar names) was split into three general armies: *Dai-Ichi So-Gun (\\"1st General Army\\", headquartered in Tokyo) *Dai-Ni So-Gun (\\"2nd General Army\\", headquartered in Hiroshima) *Koku So-Gun (\\"Air General Army\\", headquartered in Tokyo) By August 1945, these comprised two million personnel in 55 divisions and numerous smaller independent units. After the surrender of Japan, the Imperial Japanese Army was dissolved, except for the Dai-Ichi So-Gun, which existed until 30 November 1945 as the 1st Demobilization Headquarters. =Soviet Union= The Soviet Army was organized into fronts (—Ñ—Ä–æ–Ω—Ç, pl. —Ñ—Ä–æ–Ω—Ç—ã) which were often as large as an army group. (See List of Soviet fronts in World War II.) Some of the fronts contained Allied formations raised in exile. For example, the Polish First Army was part of the 1st Belorussian Front. =Western Allies= The Western Allies established six separate army groups during the Second World War, although no more than five existed simultaneously. The army groups were subordinate to the Allied theatre supreme commanders. Led by British and American officers, they included troops from numerous allied nations; the British‚ÄìAmerican 15th Army Group also included Canadian and Polish corps, divisions from Brazil, India, New Zealand and South Africa and a Greek brigade. As part of Operation Quicksilver, the Allies set up a seventh, fictitious First United States Army Group. ;Mediterranean/European Theater * 18th Army Group: Established on 20 February 1943, under the command of General Harold Alexander for the Tunisia Campaign. A primarily British formation, it comprised the British First Army and Eighth Army, but included French and American corps. After the capture of Tunisia in May 1943 it was reorganized as the 15th Army Group. * 15th Army Group: Established on 15 May 1943, under the command of General Harold Alexander for the Allied invasion of Italy. For the invasion of Sicily it consisted of the British Eighth Army and U.S. Seventh Army. Subsequently, the Seventh Army was replaced by the U.S. Fifth Army and Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark succeeded Alexander in December 1944. * 21st Army Group: Established in June 1943 under the command of General Bernard Paget. In January 1944 Paget was replaced by General Bernard Montgomery who led the army group throughout Operation Overlord and the subsequent North West Europe Campaign. 21st Army Group was made up of the First Canadian Army and the British Second Army, but also had command of the First Allied Airborne Army, U.S. First Army and U.S. Ninth Army for some operations. After the breakout from Normandy, it formed the northern wing of the Allied Expeditionary Force and was sometimes referred to as the Northern Army Group. * 12th Army Group: Established on 14 July 1944, the 12th Army Group was officially activated at noon on August 1, 1944, under the command of Lieutenant General Omar Bradley, with Lieutenant Generals Courtney Hodges and George Patton commanding First Army and Third Army, respectively. Eventually, 12th Army Group included Ninth Army under the command of Lieutenant General William Simpson and Fifteenth Army under the command of Lieutenant General \\"Gee\\" Gerow, it was the largest of the Western Allies' army groups in World War II. 12th Army Group occupied the middle of the Allied line, between the 21st and 6th Army Groups, and was sometimes referred to as the Central Army Group. This was the only army group in World War II that consisted entirely of U.S. troops. At its peak at end of the war, 12th Army Group consisted of the four aforementioned field armies, twelve corps, and over forty divisions‚Äîfour-star General Bradley commanded over 1.3 million men in his army group, the largest number of American soldiers ever commanded by a single officer in the history of the United States Army. * 6th Army Group: Established on 29 July 1944 under the command of Lieutenant General Jacob L. Devers for Operation Dragoon. Made up of the U.S. Seventh Army and the French First Army, it occupied the southern flank of the Allied Expeditionary Force in western Europe and was sometimes referred to as the Southern Army Group. ;China Burma India Theater * 11th Army Group: Established in November 1943 under the command of General George Giffard for the Burma Campaign. The 11th Army Group was originally comprised the British Fourteenth Army and Ceylon Army, with a degree of control over the Sino-American Northern Combat Area Command. In November 1944 Giffard was succeeded by Lieutenant General Oliver Leese and firm command established over the Northern Combat Area Command. General William Slim replaced Leese in July 1945, shortly before the war ended in August 1945. NATO army groups Northern Army Group During the Cold War, NATO land forces in what was designated the Central Region (most of the Federal Republic of Germany) would have been commanded in wartime by two army groups. Under Allied Forces Central Europe and alongside air force elements, the two army groups would have been responsible for the defence of Germany against any Soviet/Warsaw Pact invasion. These two principal subordinate commanders had only limited peacetime authorities, and issues such as training, doctrine, logistics, and rules of engagement were largely a national, rather than NATO, responsibility.Globalsecurity.org, Cold War NATO Army Groups, accessed 20 June 2010 The two formations were the Northern Army Group (NORTHAG) and the Central Army Group (CENTAG). By World War II and previous standards, these two formations were only armies, as they contained four corps each.David C Isby & Charles Kamps Jr, Armies of NATO's Central Front, Jane's Publishing Company Limited, 1985 NORTHAG consisted, from north to south, of I (Netherlands) Corps (I (NE) Corps), I German Corps (I (GE) Corps), I (BR) Corps, and I Belgian Corps (I (BE) Corps). Its commander was the British commander of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). CENTAG consisted, from north to south, of III (GE) Corps, V US Corps, VII (US) Corps, and II (GE) Corps in the extreme south of the Federal Republic of Germany. The commander of the U.S. Seventh Army commanded CENTAG. In November 1991, the NATO heads of state and government adopted the \\"New Strategic Concept\\" at the NATO Summit in Rome. This new conceptual orientation led, among other things, to fundamental changes both in the force and integrated command structure. Structural changes began in June 1993, when HQ Central Army Group (CENTAG) at Heidelberg and Northern Army Group (NORTHAG) at M√∂nchengladbach were deactivated and replaced by Headquarters Allied Land Forces Central Europe (LANDCENT), which was activated at Heidelberg on 1 July 1993.

The total global wine-growing area in 2010 was , all of which is grown in the Veneto region of northeast Italy, except for planted in Argentina. Corvina is used with several other grapes to create the light red regional wines Bardolino and Valpolicella that have a mild fruity flavor with hints of almond. These blends include Corvinone, Rondinella, and Molinara, and Rossignola for the latter wine. It is also used for the production of Amarone and Recioto. Wines Example of varietal wine produced from Corvina Corvina produces light to medium body wines with a light crimson coloring. The grapes' naturally high acidity can make the wine somewhat tart with a slight, bitter almond note. The finish is sometimes marked with sour- cherry notes. In some regions of Valpolicella, producers are using barrel aging to add more structure and complexity to the wine. The small berries of Corvina are low in tannins and color extract but have thick skins that are ideal for drying and protecting the grape from rot. Viticulture The Corvina vine ripens late and is prone to producing high yields which can negatively impact wine quality. During the growth cycle of the grape vine, the first few buds do not produce fruit. The vines need to be trained along a pergola which allows for a long cane that can produce more buds. Relationship to other grapes Historically in the Veneto region Corvina was often confused with Corvinone, a similar larger red grape that ripens later, but DNA profiling has shown that they are two distinct varieties. In 2005, DNA evidence showed that Corvina was a parent variety to the Venetian grape Rondinella.

Most slave codes were concerned with the rights and duties of free people in regards to enslaved people. Slave codes left a great deal unsaid, with much of the actual practice of slavery being a matter of traditions rather than formal law. The primary colonial powers all had slightly different slave codes. French colonies, after 1685, had the Code Noir specifically for this purpose. The Spanish had some laws regarding slavery in Las Siete Partidas, a far older law that was not designed for the slave societies of the Americas.Igersoll 1995, pp. 24-25 English colonies largely had their own local slave codes, mostly based on the codes of either the colonies of Barbados or Virginia.. In addition to the these national and state- or colony-level slave codes, there were city ordinances and other local restrictions regarding enslaved people.  Typical slave codes  There are many similarities between the various slave codes. The most common elements are: *Movement Restrictions: Most regions required any slaves away from their plantations or outside of the cities they resided in to have a pass signed by their master. Many cities in the slave-states required slave-tags, small copper badges that enslaved people wore, to show that they were allowed to move about. *Marriage Restrictions: Most places restricted the marriage rights of enslaved people, ostensibly to prevent them from trying to change masters by marrying into a family on another plantation.Ingersoll 1995, pp. 29-30 Marriage between people of different races was also usually restricted. *Prohibitions on Gathering: Slave codes generally prevented large groups of enslaved people from gathering away from their plantations. *Slave Patrols: In the slave-dependent portions of North America, varying degrees of legal authority backed patrols by plantation owners and other free whites to ensure that enslaved people were not free to move about at night, and to generally enforce the restrictions on slaves. *Trade and Commerce by Slaves: Initially, most places gave enslaved people some land to work personally and allowed them to operate their markets. As slavery became more profitable, slave codes restricting the rights of enslaved people to buy, sell, and produce goods were introduced. In some places, slave tags were required to be worn by enslaved people to prove that they were allowed to participate in certain types of work. *Punishment and Killing of Slaves: Slave codes regulated how slaves could be punished, usually going so far as to apply no penalty for accidentally killing a slave while punishing them. Later laws began to apply restrictions on this, but slave-owners were still rarely punished for killing their slaves.Morris 1999, pp 171-172 Historian Lawrence M. Friedman wrote: \\"Ten Southern codes made it a crime to mistreat a slave.... Under the Louisiana Civil Code of 1825 (art. 192), if a master was ‚Ä≤convicted of cruel treatment,‚Ä≤ the judge could order the sale of the mistreated slave, presumably to a better master.\\"Lawrence M. Friedman (2005). A History of American Law: Third Edition. Simon and Schuster. p.163 *Education Restrictions: Some codes made it illegal to teach slaves to read.  England's American colonies and the United States  There was no central English slave code; each colony developed its own code. In the British Thirteen Colonies, after their independence, the individual states ratified new constitutions, but their laws were generally a continuation of the laws those regions maintained prior to that point and their slave codes remaining unchanged. The first comprehensive English slave code was established in Barbados, an island in the Caribbean, in 1661. Many other slave codes of the time are based directly on this model. Modifications of the Barbadian slave codes were put in place in the Colony of Jamaica in 1664, and were then greatly modified in 1684. The Jamaican codes of 1684 were copied by the Province of South Carolina in 1691. The South Carolina slave code served as the model for many other colonies in North America. In 1770, colony of Georgia adopted the South Carolina slave code, and Florida adopted the Georgia code.Christian, pp. 27-28 Virginia's slave codes were made in parallel to those in Barbados, with individual laws starting in 1667 and a comprehensive slave code passed in 1705. The slave codes of the other tobacco colonies (Delaware, Maryland, and North Carolina) were modeled on the Virginia code. While not based directly on the codes of Barbados, the Virginia codes were inspired by them.Misrepresenting Miser esenting Misery: Slaves, Ser es, Servants, and Motiv ants, and Motives in Early es in Early Virginia, \\"This period of migration saw thousands of people move from Barbados to Virginia.

Slavery was restricted throughout the British Empire by the Slave Trade Act of 1807, which prevented trading slaves, but did not actually end slavery. In 1833, the Slavery Abolition Act ended slavery throughout the British Empire, although this did not mean that all slaves were immediately freed. In the United States, there was a division between slave states in the South and free states in the North. At the start of the American Civil War, there were 34 states in the United States, 15 of which were slave states, all of which had slave codes. The 19 free states did not have slave codes, although they still had laws regarding slavery and enslaved people, covering such issues as how to handle slaves from slave states, whether they were runaways or with their owners. Slavery was not banned nationwide in the United States until the Thirteenth Amendment was ratified on December 6, 1865. Earlier national laws greatly restricting slavery in the United States were the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves on 1 January 1808, which made it a felony to import slaves from abroad, and the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which required governments in free states to assist in the capture of fugitive slaves.  French slave codes  The French colonies in North America were the only portion of the Americas to have an effective slave code applied from the center of the empire. King Louis XIV applied the Code Noir in 1685, and it was adopted by Saint-Domingue in 1687 and the French West Indies in 1687, French Guiana in 1704, R√©union in 1723, and Louisiana in 1724. It was never applied in Canada, which had very few slaves. The Code Noir was developed in part to combat the spread of Protestantism and thus focuses more on religious restrictions than other slave codes. The Code Noir was significantly updated in 1724. The city of New Orleans in Louisiana developed slave codes under Spain, France, and the United States, due to Louisiana changing hands several times, resulting in a very complex set of slave codes. The needs of the locals were usually held in favor over any outside laws.Ingersoll 1995, pp. 23-24 France abolished slavery after the French Revolution, first by freeing second-generation slaves in 1794. Although it was reinstated under Napoleon with the law of 20 May 1802.  Spanish slave codes  In practice, the slave codes of the Spanish colonies were local laws, similar to those in other regions. There was an overarching legal code, Las Siete Partidas, which granted many specific rights to the slaves in these regions, but there is little record of it actually being used to benefit the slaves in the Americas. Las Siete Partidas was compiled in the thirteenth century, long before the colonization of the new world, and its treatment of slavery was based on the Roman tradition. Frank Tannenbaum, an influential sociologist who wrote on the treatment of slaves in the Americas, treated the laws in Las Siete Partidas as an accurate reflection of treatment, but later scholarship has moved away from this viewpoint, arguing that the official laws in Las Siete Partidas did not reflect practices in the colonies. An attempt to unify the Spanish slave codes, the Codigo Negro, was cancelled without ever going into effect because it was unpopular with the slave-owners in the Americas. The Laws of the Indies were an ongoing body of laws, modified throughout the history of the Spanish colonies, that incorporated many slave laws in the later versions.Igersoll 1995, pp. 53-54 Specific slave codes * Barbados slave codes * Code Noir; French black code * New York slave codes *South Carolina slave codes * Virginia slave codes of 1705 See also * Anti-literacy laws in the United States * Atlantic slave trade * Conscription * Convict leasing * Coolie * Debt bondage * Forced labor * Human trafficking * Indentured servants * International Year to Commemorate the Struggle against Slavery and its Abolition * Slave narrative * Slave rebellion * Slave Trade Acts * Slave trade ** Janissaries ** Mamluks ** Saqaliba * Slavery in Africa * Slavery in Canada * Slavery in the colonial United States * Slavery in the United States ** Origins of the American Civil War ** North Carolina v.

Outside of Italy, Dolcetto is known as Douce Noire in Savoie and Charbono in California. However, DNA fingerprinting done at the University of California, Davis has shown that the actual Douce Noire and Charbono vines are not, in fact, Dolcetto, but two different vines. In spite of this confirmation, some plantings of true Dolcetto vines still retain the local synonyms in some areas of Savoie and California. The grape was first brought to California by expatriate Italians, and is most popular in Lodi AVA, Mendocino County, Russian River Valley AVA, Napa Valley AVA, Santa Cruz Mountains AVA, Sta.

Decree of 6 July 2005, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica Italiana, of 23 July 2005. Wines A Dolcetto d'Alba from Piedmont. Dolcetto wines are known for black cherry and licorice with some prune flavors, and a characteristically bitter finish reminiscent of almonds. While the name implies sweetness, the wines are normally dry. The tannic nature of the grape contributes to a characteristic bitter finish. The dark purple skin of Dolcetto grapes have high amounts of anthocyanins, which require only a short maceration time with the skin to produce a dark-colored wine. The amount of skin contact affects the resulting tannin levels in the wine, with most winemakers preferring to limit maceration time to as short as possible.O. Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 87 Harcourt Books 2001 During fermentation, the wine is prone to the wine fault of reduction.

He established Fort Leavenworth in Kansas, and named after him is the city of Leavenworth, Kansas, Leavenworth County, Kansas, and the Leavenworth Penitentiary. Early life and education He was born at New Haven, Connecticut, a son of Col. Jesse and Catharine (Conklin) Leavenworth. Soon after his birth his parents became alienated and his father moved with the children to Danville, Vermont, where he was educated. He then read law with General Erastus Root of Delhi, New York; and upon being admitted to the bar formed a partnership with his preceptor which lasted until 1812. Military career =War of 1812= Leavenworth was commissioned as a captain in the 25th U. S. Infantry in April 1812, shortly before the outbreak of the War of 1812. In August 1813 he was promoted to major of the 9th Infantry. He was wounded at the Battle of Niagara on July 25, 1814, and the following November was brevetted to the rank of colonel. =Post war= After the war, he then served in the New York State Assembly, in 1816,Bio data and then he went to Prairie du Chien as Indian agent, and on February 10, 1818, was made lieutenant-colonel of the Fifth U. S. Infantry. In 1820 he began constructing Fort St. Anthony from the Cantonment New Hope stockade.Dakota County Historical Society =Later career= In 1823, he led U.S. Army troops in the Arikara War, the first U.S. military expedition against a Great Plains Indian nation. While on duty in the West he built several military posts, one of which was Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, established May 8, 1827 as Cantonment Leavenworth, now one of the leading military establishments of the country. In 1825 he was made brigadier-general by brevet. In 1834 he commanded the United States Regiment of Dragoons during its expedition from Fort Gibson, Indian Territory to the Wichita Mountains. The artist George Catlin was also in this expedition, and wrote of Leavenworth's death. They hoped to meet and open formal relations among the United States and the Comanche, Kiowa, and Wichita (tribe) peoples.

Since the end of the 20th century, wineries located in Washington's Yakima River Valley, Maryland, Arizona, Texas, West Virginia, Chile, Mexico's Baja California Peninsula, and Ontario's Niagara Peninsula have also produced wines from Durif grapes. It is the main grape known in the U.S. and Israel as Petite Sirah, with over 90% of the California plantings labeled \\"Petite Sirah\\" being Durif grapes; the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) recognizes \\"Durif\\" and \\"Petite Sirah\\" as synonyms for the same grape.PS I Love You Petite Sirah Timeline It produces tannic wines with a spicy, plummy flavour. The grape originated as a cross of Syrah pollen germinating a Peloursin plant. On some occasions, Peloursin and Syrah vines may be called Petite Sirah, usually because the varieties are extremely difficult to distinguish in old age.  History  In the 1860s the French botanist Fran√ßois Durif kept a nursery of several grape varieties at his home in the commune of Tullins where he most likely had plantings of both Peloursin and Syrah. At some point the two vines cross pollinated and Durif discovered a new grape variety growing in his nursery. It was identified and named Plant du Rif (later Durif) by ampelographer Victor Pulliat in 1868.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes ‚Äì A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 316-317 & 779, Allen Lane 2012 As a conclusion of DNA fingerprinting at the University of California, Davis in 1997, Syrah was identified as the source of the pollen that originally crossed with Peloursin flowers. The grape's high resistance to downy mildew encouraged its cultivation in the early 20th century in areas like Is√®re and Ard√®che, although the relative low quality of the resulting wine caused the grape to fall out of favor with local wine authorities. Today, it is almost nonexistent in France.J. Robinson \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 244 Oxford University Press 2006  Regional production  Australia and California are now the two leading producers of Durif.

DNA fingerprinting has shown that the majority of Petite Sirah plantings in California are actually Durif.O. Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 88 Harcourt Books 2001 Some vineyards were found to be a field blend of Durif and other varieties, such as Mondeuse noire, all labeled as \\"Petite Sirah\\".Appellation America \\"Mondeuse-Refosco\\" Accessed: May 7th, 2013 The vine is a popular planting in Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, Monterey and San Joaquin County. In addition to being produced as a varietal wine, the grape is sometimes blended with Zinfandel. In years when heavy rain or excess sun has weakened the quality or yield of Cabernet Sauvignon or Pinot noir plantings, Petite Sirah may also be used as a blending partner to strengthen the wine. The average age of Petite Sirah vines tends to be older than that of most Californian vines. As of December 2007, the TTB lists both Petite Sirah and Durif in 27 CFR ¬ß 4.91 as approved grape varieties for American wines, but they are not listed as synonyms. This means that U.S. producers can produce Durif wine, but not label it as Petite Sirah, and vice versa. The ATF proposed that they be recognised as synonyms in Notice of Proposed Rulemaking No. 941, published in the Federal Register on 10 April 2002, but a decision on RIN 1513‚ÄìAA32 (formerly RIN 1512-AC65)Federal Register: June 6, 2002 (Volume 67, Number 109) appears to be postponed indefinitely, probably because the new regulation is tied up in the trade dispute that would see the TTB recognise Primitivo as a synonym for Zinfandel.2206\\\\. Proposal To Recognize Synonyms For Petite Sirah And Zinfandel Grape Varieties While not one of the officially sanctioned grapes of the C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne AOC, Petite Sirah's linking to Durif caused the California's Rhone Rangers to add the grape to its listings of wine in 2002.M. Worobiec \\"Petite Sirah Rides Shotgun as Rhone Rangers Trot Into Town \\" Wine Spectator April 30, 2002 = Israel = Petite Sirah/Durif in bloom. In Israel, Petite Sirah had a history much like that in California‚Äîhistorically used as a blending grape to add body to inferior wines. However, Petite Sirah has recently experienced somewhat of a revival, both in high-end blends and bottled as a single or majority variety. The UC Davis-trained winemaker and Ph.D. chemist Ya'ir Margalit, familiar with the grape from his time in California, showed that Petite Sirah need not be consigned to jug wine when he blended small portions into his reserve Cabernet Sauvignon. Since 2002 Assaf Paz enologist and co-owner at Vitkin Winery is consistently producing a single-varietal Petite Sirah as a high end wine sourced from the oldest Petite Sirah vineyard in Israel. Seeing that Israeli terroir could grow great Petite Sirah, wineries such as Lewis Pasco the founding winemaker at Recanati followed suit with a Petite Sirah/Zinfandel blend, while others like Sea Horse, Carmel and Tishbi have made single- varietal Petite Sirah in addition to using it for blending.  Petite Sirah and Petite Syrah  Petite Sirah is sometimes mistakenly spelled \\"Petite Syrah,\\" which has historically referred to a small berried clone of the Syrah grape by Rh√¥ne growers.O. Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 168 Harcourt Books 2001 In California, immigrant vine growers introduced Syrah in 1878 and used the phrase \\"Petite Syrah\\" to refer to the lower yields that the vines then were producing in California. Actual Petite Sirah (Durif) was then introduced in 1884.  Viticulture  Durif leaf. The \\"petite\\" in the name of this grape refers to the size of its berries and not the vine, which is particularly vigorous. The leaves are large, with a bright green upper surface and paler green lower surface. The grape forms tightly packed clusters that can be susceptible to rotting in rainy environments. The small berries create a high skin to juice ratio, which can produce very tannic wines if the juice goes through an extended maceration period.Durif Grape Variety Cellarnotes.net In the presence of new oak barrels, the wine can develop an aroma of melted chocolate.J. Laube \\"Petite's Road Back \\" Wine Spectator Jan 31st, 2004 In the 20th century, ampelographers Louis Levadoux and (decades later) Linda Bisson categorized Durif as a member of the Pelorsien eco-geogroup along with Bia blanc, B√©clan, Dureza, Exbrayat, Jacqu√®re, Joubertin, Mondeuse blanche, Peloursin, Servanin and Verdesse.  Wine  A glass of Californian Petite Sirah. Petite Sirah produces dark, inky colored wines that are relatively acidic, with firm texture and mouth feel; the bouquet has herbal and black pepper overtones, and typically offers flavors of blue fruit, black fruit, plums, and especially blueberries. Compared to Syrah, the wine is noticeably more dark and purplish in color, and typically rounder and fuller in the mouth, and offers a brightness that Syrah lacks.Clark Smith, \\"Don't Call it Durif \\" The wines are very tannic, with aging ability that can exceed 20 years in the bottle. Petite Sirah can sometimes be rather \\"short\\", that is, the flavor does not linger in the mouth, hence the benefit of blending with another grape which may lack mid-palate depth, but add length and elegance.

It was a science research mission that achieved orbit successfully, but the planned duration was a failure due to a technical problem with a fuel cell that resulted in the abort of the 15 day duration. Columbia returned to Earth just shy of four days. The mission was re-flown as STS-94 with the same crew later that year. Crew Mission highlights This mission was originally launched on 4 April 1997, and was intended to be on orbit for 15 days, 16 hours. The mission was cut short due to a problem with Fuel Cell #2 and it landed on 8 April, after 3 days 23 hours. NASA decided to fly the mission again as STS-94, which launched 1 July 1997. The primary payload on STS-83 was the Microgravity Science Laboratory (MSL). MSL was a collection of microgravity experiments housed inside a European Spacelab Long Module (LM). It built on the cooperative and scientific foundation of the International Microgravity Laboratory missions (IML-1 on STS-42 and IML-2 on STS-65), the United States Microgravity Laboratory missions (USML-1 on STS-50 and USML-2 on STS-73), the Japanese Spacelab mission (Spacelab-J on STS-47), the Spacelab Life and Microgravity Science Mission (LMS on STS-78) and the German Spacelab missions (D-1 on STS-61-A and D-2 on STS-55). MSL featured 19 materials science investigations in four major facilities. These facilities were the Large Isothermal Furnace, the EXpedite the Processing of Experiments to the Space Station (EXPRESS) Rack, the Electromagnetic Containerless Processing Facility (TEMPUS) and the Coarsening in Solid‚ÄìLiquid Mixtures (CSLM) facility, the Droplet Combustion Experiment (DCE) and the Combustion Module-1 Facility. Additional technology experiments were to be performed in the Middeck Glovebox (MGBX) developed by the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and the High- Packed Digital Television (HI-PAC DTV) system was used to provide multi- channel real-time analog science video. The Large Isothermal Furnace was developed by the Japanese Space Agency (NASDA) for the STS-47 Spacelab-J mission and was also flown on STS-65 IML-2 mission. It housed the measurement of diffusion coefficient by shear cell method experiment, the diffusion of liquid metals and alloys experiment, the diffusion in liquid led-tin-telluride experiment, the impurity diffusion in ionic melts experiment, the liquid phase sintering II experiment (LIF), and the diffusion processes in molten semiconductors experiment (DPIMS). The Combustion Module-1 (CM-1) facility from the NASA Lewis Research Center housed experiments on Laminar Soot Processes Experiment and the Structure of Flame Balls at Low Lewis-number Experiment (SOFBALL). The Droplet Combustion Experiment (DCE) is designed to investigate the fundamental combustion aspects of single, isolated droplets under different pressures and ambient oxygen concentrations for a range of droplet sizes varying between and . The DCE apparatus is integrated into a single width MSL Spacelab rack in the cargo bay. The EXPRESS rack replaces a Spacelab Double rack and special hardware will provide the same structural and resource connections the rack will have on the Space Station. It will house the Physics of Hard Spheres (PHaSE) experiment and the Astro/PGBA Experiment. The Electromagnetic Containerless Processing Facility (TEMPUS) is used for the experiments on nucleation in different flow regimes, thermophysical properties of advanced materials in the undercooled liquid state experiment, measurements of the surface tension of liquid and undercooled metallic alloys by oscillating drop technique experiment, alloy undercooling experiments, the study of the morphological stability of growing dendrites by comparative dendrite velocity measurements on pure ni and dilute Ni-C alloy in the Earth and space laboratory experiment, the undercooled melts of alloys with polytetrahedral short-range order experiment, the thermal expansion of glass forming metallic alloys in the undercooled state experiment, the AC calorimetry and thermophysical properties of bulk glass-forming metallic liquids experiment and the measurement of surface tension and viscosity of undercooled liquid metals experiment. There were also experiments on measuring microgravity. They included the space acceleration measurement system (SAMS), the microgravity measurement assembly (MMA), the quasi-steady acceleration measurement system and the orbital acceleration research experiment (OARE). The middeck glovebox (MGBX) facility supported the bubble and drop nonlinear dynamics (BDND) experiment, the study of the fundamental operation of a capillary-driven heat transfer (CHT) device in microgravity experiment, the internal flows in a free drop (IFFD) experiment and the fiber-supported droplet combustion experiment (FSDC-2). Comet Hale-Bopp as seen from the shuttle Reflight Prior to launch, and continuing through the early part of the mission, flight controllers on the ground were monitoring an anomaly within the electrical power generating Fuel Cell #2 (of three), making it appear that oxygen and hydrogen might be starting to uncontrollably mix, which could lead to detonation (a similar scenario that caused the explosion on Apollo 13). Despite troubleshooting, the anomaly persisted and appeared to worsen. Mission Flight Rules required that the fuel cell be shut down once a certain voltage threshold had been crossed, and with only two of three fuel cells working, that invoked another Flight Rule which required the mission be terminated early (loss of a second fuel cell would require severe and dangerous powerdowns, though the shuttle operates normally on two). Payload Specialist Dr. Linteris described the mission as \\"an exercise in crisis management. The main buss alarm was going off continually.\\" Astronaut Chris Hadfield served as CAPCOM for STS-83. He cited NASA's decision to terminate the mission as a positive example of applying the Flight Rules body of knowledge to ensure astronaut safety: \\"The beauty of Flight Rules is that they create certainty when we have to make tough calls.... In real time, the temptation to take a chance is always higher. However, the flight rules were unequivocal: the Shuttle had to return to Earth.\\" Upon landing, mission managers decided that Columbia did not need to be processed per a typical end of mission maintenance flow. Instead, they called for an unprecedented reflight of the same mission, once the normal processing could be completed (refill the propellant tanks and other consumables like oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and water, change out the main engines, etc.). The same crew flew the reflight, which was designated STS-94 (the next available unused shuttle mission number at the time), three months later, in July 1997. The crew patch was updated with the reflight, changing the outer border from red to blue and changing the flight number from 83 to 94.

It is also grown in the tiny Hungarian wine region of Soml√≥. Furmint plays a similar role in the Slovakian wine region of Tokaj. It is also grown in Austria where it is known as Mosler. Smaller plantings are found in Slovenia where it is known as ≈†ipon. The grape is also planted in Croatia, where it is known as Moslavac.

Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 292 & 348 Oxford University Press 2006 The name Furmint may have been taken from the word froment for the wheat-gold color of the wine it produces. While it is possible that the grape was brought to Hungary in the 13th century during the reign of King B√©la IV, ampelographers believe that the grape is likely native to the region.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 37, 373-375, 1115 Allen Lane 2012  History  Furmint has been growing in the Tokaji region of north-eastern Hungary since at least the late 16th century when a document dated May 15, 1571 described the grape growing in the H√©tsz≈ël≈ë vineyard in Tokaj. In 1611, the grape was also noted to have been growing in the Gyep≈± Valley of the Zempl√©n Mountains near the town of Erd≈ëb√©nye, about north of Tokaj. While many other wine grapes have been used in the production of the historic Tokaji dessert wine, Furmint's use for the wine was well established by at least the late 18th century when, in 1796, the Hungarian politician J√°nos Dercs√©nyi described Furmint as the \\"genuine Tokaji Asz√∫\\" grape. = Origins = Gouais blanc, one of the likely parent varieties of Furmint. In the early 21st century, DNA analysis confirmed that a parent- offspring relationship exist between Furmint and the Hunnic grape Gouais blanc. As Gouais blanc, has been noted in documents since the early Middle Ages and has been well established as the parent of several grape varieties such as Riesling, Chardonnay, Elbling and Gamay, ampelographers believe that Furmint is likely the offspring of Gouais blanc instead of the other way around. DNA analysis also suggested that parent-offspring relationships exist with the Hungarian wine grape H√°rslevel≈± and the Swiss wine grape Plantscher but instead of either being the second parent to Furmint with Gouais blanc, ampelographers believe that it is more likely that Furmint is one of the parent variety for both grapes. Like Pinot noir, Sangiovese and many other grape varieties, Furmint has beget over centuries a variety of clones, including a pink-skinned color mutation known as Piros Furmint. As nearly all of these clones are found, almost exclusively, within the Tokaji region, ampelographers believe that it is highly probable that Furmint originated in this part of Hungary. = Other theories = Furmint may have been introduced to Hungary during the reign of King B√©la IV. Other theories of Furmint's origins have the grape being introduced to the Austro-Hungarian area in the Middle Ages. As noted by Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, the grape may have been brought to Hungary in the 13th century during the reign of King B√©la IV. Following the destruction of the Mongolian invasion of Hungary, B√©la wanted to quickly revive the country's devastated vineyards. The king instituted several policies encouraging mass immigration of people knowledgeable in viticulture and winemaking.DiWine Taste \\"Hungary wine\\" Issue 11, September 2003 Many of the immigrants that heeded B√©la's call brought new grape varieties with them - one of which may have been Furmint.Wein-Plus Glossar: \\"Hungary\\" Accessed: December 18th, 2009 Another theory has the grape being introduced even early by Italian missionaries during the reign of Stephen II of Hungary. This theory, as noted by the French ampelographer Pierre Galet, could have Furmint originating from the Lazio city of Formia located along the Appian Way with the name being a corruption of Formia's Latin name Formianum. A later Italian introduction is credited to a soldier from Collio Goriziano region of Friuli- Venezia Giulia who fought in the Seven Years' War between 1754 (sometimes dated to 1756) and 1763. The soldier, who was nicknamed Forment from the Italian fromento for \\"wheat\\" due to his wheat-colored, reddish blonde beard, was granted the title of Count of Formentin by Empress Maria Theresa. In gratitude, according to this legend, the Count sent grapevines from his native land to the Empress who had them planted in Tokaji. However, ampelographers often dismiss these Italian origin theories because, in addition to documentation showing Furmint growing in Hungary before the Seven Years' War, DNA evidence has not connected Furmint to any Italian grape variety (as a sibling or, more likely, a parent through a natural crossing) which would seem unlikely if Furmint did originate in Italy. Other theories for Furmint's origin note the grape's similarities to the Savoy wine grape Altesse and speculate that the grape may have originated there or even in Byzantium where, according to legend, Altesse was brought back to Savoy in 1367 by Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy. The Syrmia region with Serbia has also been listed as one potential birthplace for the grape.  Viticulture  Furmint grape cluster and leaf from Viala et Vermorel's 1901-1910 ampelography texts. Furmint is a late-ripening grape variety that also tends to buds early in the growing season which can make the grapevine susceptible to springtime frosts. While the loose-bunches and thick-skins of the berries make Furmint ideal for producing botrytized dessert wines, the grape can be susceptible to the viticultural hazard of powdery mildew. The Furmint vine has a high tolerance for drought condition which can allow the grape to be planted in regions with limited irrigation sources. In Hungary, Furmint has shown a high degree of genetic diversity with several clones and color mutation of the grape being propagated in the Tokaji region. Several of these clones, including the F√©her (white), Holyagos and Mad√°rk√°s clones were well known and in production prior to World War II. Other common clones of Furmint used in wine production includes the loose-berried Lazaf√ºrt≈± and the V√°ltoz√≥ (variable) clone and the pink-skinned color mutation of Piros Furmint. Ampelographers have noted the proliferation of so many clones of Furmint found almost exclusively in the Tokaj region of Hungary are strong indicators that the grape likely originated in this region as opposed to be introduced from another area.  Relationship to other grapes  The Hungarian wine grape Z√©ta (also known as Oremus) is a crossing of Furmint and Bouvier which, like Furmint, is often used in the production of Tokaji. DNA profiling conducted at the University of Zagreb has shown Furmint to be likely to have a parent-offspring relationship with Gouais blanc, which similar research elsewhere has shown to be a parent of numerous other varieties, making Furmint a half-sibling to nearly 80 different grape varieties. Furmint has also been confirmed to be the same grape as the Croatian white variety Moslavac. Currently, there are only two known (or suspected) natural crossings of Furmint‚Äîthe Tokaji wine grape H√°rslevel≈± and the Swiss wine grape Plantscher. In 1937, Furmint was crossed with the Croatian wine grape Malvazija Istarska to create Vega. The grape has also been used to create the Italian wine grapes Bussanello (with Riesling Italico) and Fubiano (with Trebbiano) and the Hungarian grape Oremus/Z√©ta (with Bouvier). = Confusion with other varieties = Furmint shares a wide range of synonyms with several other European grape varieties - such as Sauvignon vert which was once known under the synonym of Tocai Friulano even though the grape was probably never used in the production of Tokay. To confuse things further, not only does Furmint share several synonyms with Sauvignon vert but Sauvignon vert itself is a synonym for the \\"green berry\\" sub-variety of Furmint. This, coupled with physical similarities between several strains of white grapevines makes identification of different wines, particularly those in developing Eastern European countries difficult. The grape shares some morphological similarities with the Savoy wine grape Altesse and has been historically confused with the French wine grape variety. In Hungary, Furmint is sometimes confused with K√©knyel≈± while on the island of Korƒçula, in Croatia, the grape has been confused with Po≈°ip. The Romanian wine grape GrasƒÉ de Cotnari and the Bosnian wine grape ≈Ωilavka also shares several synonyms with Furmint and are, thusly, often confused with the grape.  Wine regions  Village level Furmint In 2006, there were of Furmint in cultivation in Hungary, more than 97% of which found in the Tokaj-Hegyalja region. The remaining plantings are found in the western Hungarian region of Soml√≥. In Tokaj, the grape is often blended with H√°rslevel≈± and S√°rga Muskot√°ly (Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains) to produce the noble rot-influenced dessert wine Tokaji. Around the villages of M√°d, T√°llya, R√°tka and Tolcsva in Borsod-Aba√∫j-Zempl√©n County, the grape has a long history of being used for dry wine production as well. Dry Furmint came to the attention of wine connoisseurs and experts of the world when the √ör√°gya 2000 single vineyard selection was introduced by Istv√°n Szepsy. The wine expressed great minerality, complexity and structure, which has been experienced only in the finest white wines of historic regions like Burgundy or the Mosel before. The aging potential was also promising. In 2003 more producers of M√°d village produced single vineyard selected dry Furmint wines with great success. M√°d village with its almost 1200 ha had the opportunity to produce high quality dry Furmint wine in significant quantity as a commune level wine, which can express the unique volcanic terroir of the region. Vineyards in the Tokaj-Hegyalja region where Furmint is most widely planted. = Outside Hungary = Outside Hungary, it is found planted around the Crimea where producers have endeavored to make their own versions of Tokaji. For the same reason, small plantings of the grape have been done in the Swartland region of South Africa. In Austria it is most commonly found in Burgenland (where is known as Zapfner)) and Styria (where it is known as Mosler). In the Burgenland region (now in Austria), Furmint was historically associated with the production of the sweet dessert wine Ausbruch. The grape gradually fell out of favor in the Burgenland but in the 21st century, several Ausbruch winemakers (particularly around Rust) have been rediscovering the grape's potential in their area. In 2010, there were of the grape in cultivation in Austria, mostly around Rust. Across the border from Hungary, in Slovakia, Furmint is most commonly used in the production of sweet wines in the Tokaj region that includes several towns within the Trebi≈°ov District: Bara, ƒåerhov, ƒåernochov, Mal√° T≈ï≈àa, Slovensk√© Nov√© Mesto, Veƒæk√° T≈ï≈àa, and Viniƒçky.Cav. Subhash Arora \\"Tokaj wine region of Slovakia\\" Indian Wine Academy. April 15th, 2008 In Slovenia, Furmint is known as ≈†ipon with in cultivation in 2009, mostly along the Podravina river in the Styria region. Here the grape is often made as a varietal wine in both dry and sweet, Tokaji-like styles. Furmint is also known as ≈†ipon in Croatia (where it is also known as Moslavac) as well. Here the grape is almost always used to make dry style wine with of the variety in cultivation as of 2008. In Zagreb County of the Moslavina region, Croatian wine producers have also been experimenting with using Furmint in sparkling wines, often blended with Chardonnay and Pinot blanc. Furmint is most widely known for being a primary component of Tokaji wine. In the United States, there are some isolated plantings of Furmint in the California wine region of the Russian River AVA of Sonoma County.Appellation America \\"Furmint\\" Varietal Character Index, Accessed: May 13th, 2014  Wines and styles  Furmint can be produced in a variety of styles ranging from bone dry to extremely sweet wines affected by noble rot. The grape has the potential to produce wines with naturally high levels of acidity with complex flavors derived from phenolic compounds in the juice and through brief contact with the grape skins. Furmint wines, particularly the botrytized dessert wines, can have immense aging potential with some well made examples from favorable vintages continuing to age for over a century. These wines, described by wine expert Oz Clarke as nearly \\"immortal\\", are most often the asz√∫ style wines of Tokaji made from the top 10-15% of Furmint harvested. This potential comes from the balance of acidity and high levels of sugars in the wine which act as preservatives during the aging process. Dry styles of Furmint are characterized by their aroma notes of smoke, pears and lime. Dessert style wines can develop notes of marzipan, blood orange, apricots and barley sugar. As these dessert styles of Furmint age they will often develop more smokey and spicy notes of tobacco, tea, cinnamon and even chocolate.

Its full name is Gamay Noir √† Jus Blanc. It is a very old cultivar, mentioned as long ago as the 15th century. It has been often cultivated because it makes for abundant production; however, it can produce wines of distinction when planted on acidic soils, which help to soften the grape's naturally high acidity.Fanet, Jacuqes. Great Wine Terroirs, University of California Press, Berkeley (2004) pp. 60‚Äì61. History A Beaujolais Nouveau wine made from Gamay. The Gamay grape is thought to have appeared first in the village of the Gamay, south of Beaune, in the 1360s.Hugh Johnson, Vintage: The Story of Wine p. 133. Simon & Schuster 1989 The grape brought relief to the village growers following the decline of the Black Death. In contrast to the Pinot noir variety, Gamay ripened two weeks earlier and was less difficult to cultivate. It also produced a strong, fruitier wine in a much larger abundance. In July 1395, the Duke of Burgundy Philippe the Bold outlawed the cultivation of the grape, referring to it as the \\"disloyal Gaamez\\" that in spite of its ability to grow in abundance was full of \\"very great and horrible harshness\\", due in part to the variety's occupation of land that could be used for the more \\"elegant\\" Pinot Noir. Sixty years later Philippe the Good issued another edict against Gamay in which he stated the reasoning for the ban is that \\"The Dukes of Burgundy are known as the lords of the best wines in Christendom. We will maintain our reputation\\".Hugh Johnson, Vintage: The Story of Wine p. 134. Simon & Schuster 1989 Characteristics Vineyard in La Rochepot, Hautes- C√¥tes de Beaune. The closely spaced rows in the foreground are Gamay; in the background are more widely spaced rows of Pinot noir. Gamay is a very vigorous vine which tends not to root very deeply on alkaline soils resulting in pronounced hydrological stress on the vines over the growing season with a correspondingly high level of acidity in the grapes. The acidity is softened through carbonic maceration, a process that also allows the vibrant youthful fruit expressions reminiscent of bright crushed strawberries and raspberries, as well as deep floral notes of lilac and violets. Gamay-based wines are typically light bodied and fruity. Wines meant to be drunk after some modest aging tend to have more body and are produced by whole-berry maceration. The latter are produced mostly in the designated 'Cru Beaujolais' areas where the wines typically have the flavor of sour cherries, black pepper, and dried berry, as well as fresh-cut stone and chalk. Regional production A sparkling Cr√©mant de Bourgogne blanc de noirs (white of blacks) made from Pinot noir and Gamay In addition to being well suited to the terroir of Beaujolais, Gamay is grown extensively in the Loire Valley around Tours, where it is typically blended with Cabernet Franc and C√¥t, a local clone of Malbec. These wines are similar to those of Crus Beaujolais but with raspberry notes and the signature fresh-peppery nose of the Cabernet Franc. Gamay is also the grape of the Beaujolais nouveau, produced exclusively from the more alkaline soils of Southern Beaujolais where the grape is incapable of making drinkable wines without aggressive carbonic maceration.Fanet, Jacuqes. Great Wine Terroirs, University of California Press, Berkeley (2004) p. 59 The acid levels of the grape grown in the limestone Pierres Dore√©s of the South are too high for making wines with any appeal beyond the early release Nouveaux. Gamay is commonly grown in the Niagara Peninsula in Canada, some producers being in the Short Hills Bench, Beamsville Bench and St. David's Bench, as well as in Prince Edward County. Ch√¢teau des Charmes in Niagara-on-the-Lake has a regional clone which they discovered, Gamay Noir Droit, which is a recognized mutation. It is also grown successfully by a small number of wineries in Australia to make a range of wines including light-bodied red wines suitable for early drinking. Gamay has also been introduced into Oregon's Willamette Valley wine region, a place known for its wines made from Pinot noir, another Burgundian grape. It was introduced by Amity Vineyards in 1988.Appellationamerica.com Amity Vineyards In 1991, Rebecca's Vineyard planted Gamay and was one few Oregon vineyards selling the grapes. LaBete winery was the first to make a vineyard designate of Gamay from Rebecca's Vineyard. Since then, Rebecca's Vineyard stopped selling Gamay to those who would only blend into their Pinot Noir for flavor and color enhancement, and to only sell to those who would produce stand alone Gamay. Younger wineries like Division Winemaking Co., who are now the largest producer of Gamay in Oregon, have helped raise awareness and availability of the grape in Oregon. Significant new plantings are underway in the Willamette Valley and there's even a festival called I Love Gamay held in nearby Portland. Tasting notes published by the vineyards at Amity, WillaKenzie, Division, Brickhouse, and Methven describe wines that match the basic profiles of Crus Beaujolais.See the websites of Amity, WillaKenzie, Brickhouse, Division Winemaking Co. and Methven Family Vineyards for their tasting notes. Similarly named grapes and offspring The Gamay name has become attached to other varieties grown in California, which at one time were thought to be the true Gamay. The grape 'Napa Gamay' is now known as Valdigui√©, and the name Napa Gamay has not appeared on labels from 2007 onwards.

Robinson Jancis Robinson's Wine Course Third Edition pg 110 Abbeville Press 2003 Viticulture and wines The Garganega vine has a tendency to ripen late and can be very vigorous. In the fertile flatlands outside the Soave Classico zone, the grape can produce excessively high yields that lead to very thin and neutral flavored wines. The acid levels in Garganega lends itself well to the production of sweet recioto wines that have the potential to improve with bottle age for a decade or more. Pedigree An Italian study published in 2008 using DNA typing showed a close genetic relationship between Garganega on the one hand and several other Italian grape varieties on the other hand: Albana, Catarratto, Empibotte, Greco Bianco del Pollino, Malvasia di Candia a Sapore Semplice, Marzemina bianca, Montonico bianco and Trebbiano Toscano (also known as Ugni blanc). It is possible that Garganega is one of the parents of each of these grape varieties. However, since the parents of Garganega have not been identified, the exact nature of the relationship in each case could not be conclusively established.‚ÄòSangiovese‚Äô and ‚ÄòGarganega‚Äô are two key varieties of the Italian grapevine assortment evolution , M. Crespan, A. Cal√≤, S. Giannetto, A. Sparacio, P. Storchi and A. Costacurta, Vitis 47 (2), 97‚Äì104 (2008) The results were of particular interest, since these seven grape varieties are spread from north to south Italy (and Trebbiano Toscano beyond Italy's border), which indicates that Garganega is a key variety in the pedigree of white Italian grape varieties. Synonyms Garganega is also known under the synonyms D'Oro, Decanico, Dorana di Venetia, Garganega Comune, Garganega di Gambellara, Garganega Gentile, Garganega Grossa, Garganega Piramidale, Garganega Veronese, Gracanico Dorato, Grecani, Grecanico, Grecanico Bianco, Grecanico Dorato, Grecanicu Biancu, Grecanio, Greccanico, Lizzara, Malvasia de Manresa, Ora, Oro, Ostesa, Ostesona, and Recanicu.Garganega , Vitis International Variety Catalogue, accessed on 2010-11-24 J.

The post of chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee was formally the highest state post in the RSFSR. Sverdlov is sometimes regarded as the first head of state of the Soviet Union although it was not established until 1922, three years after his death. Early life Yakov Sverdlov in 1904 Sverdlov was born in Nizhny Novgorod as Yakov-Aaron Mikhailovich Sverdlovhttps://rg.ru/2019/03/13/reg- pfo/nizhegorodskie-arhivisty-razvenchali-nekotorye-mify-o-iakove- sverdlove.html to Jewish parents, Mikhail Izrailevich Sverdlov and Elizaveta Solomonova. His father was a politically active engraver who produced forged documents and stored arms for the revolutionary underground. The Sverdlov family had six children: two daughters (Sophia and Sara) and four sons (Zinovy, Yakov, Veniamin, and Lev). After his wife's death in 1900, Mikhail converted with his family to the Russian Orthodox Church, married Maria Aleksandrovna Kormiltseva, and had two more sons, Herman and Alexander. Sverdlov's father was sympathetic to his children's socialist tendencies and 5 out of his 6 children would become involved in revolutionary politics at some point. Mikhail watched as his household slowly became a revolutionary hotspot, where the Novgorod Social Democrats would meet, write pamphlets, and even forge stamps for false passports. Yakov's eldest brother Zinovy was adopted by Maxim Gorky, who was a frequent guest at the house. Zinovy was the only Sverdlov to reject revolutionary politics and had little to no contact with Yakov after the revolution.Page 147, Yakov excelled at school, and after 4 years in gymnasium left to become a pharmacist's apprentice and a \\"professional revolutionary,\\" Sverdlov joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1902, and then later the Bolshevik faction, supporting Vladimir Lenin. In his youth, Sverdlov became friends with fellow revolutionary Vladimir Lubotsky (later known as Zagorsky). He was involved in the 1905 revolution while living in the Ural Mountains. Though never actually attending college, Sverdlov adopted the garb of the radical students at the time‚Äì\\"With his medium height, unruly brown hair, glasses continually perched on his nose, and Tolstoy shirt worn under his jacket, Sverdlov looked like a student, and for us...a student meant a revolutionary.\\" Sverdlov became a major activist and speaker in Nizhny Novgorod. In 1906, Sverdlov was arrested and held in the Yekaterinburg prison until his release. During his time in prison, Sverdlov continued to educate himself and others, reading Lenin, Marx, Kautsky, Heine, and more. Sverdlov attempted to live by the motto: \\"I put books to the test of life, and life to the test of books.\\" For most of the time from his arrest in June 1906 until 1917 he was either imprisoned or exiled. In March of 1911, Sverdlov was held in the St. Petersburg House of Pretrial Detention. Sverdlov married a Bolshevik party member and meteorologist named Klavdia Novgorodtseva. In 1911, their first child, Andrei Yakovlevich Sverdlov, was born. In 1913, their second child, Vera, was born and in 1915 Klavdia joined Yakov in exile in the village of Monastyrskoe. Sverdlov and his wife ran a Bolshevik reading circle in the town, which though illegal, escaped the notice of the local authorities. During the period 1914‚Äì1916 he was in internal exile in Turukhansk, Siberia, along with Joseph Stalin (then known as Dzhugashvili). Both had been betrayed by the Okhrana agent Roman Malinovsky. Of Stalin, Sverdlov wrote \\"The comrade I was with turned out to be such a person, socially, that we didn't talk or see each other. It was terrible.\\"P. 48 Like Stalin, he was co-opted in absentia to the 1912 Prague Conference. In 1914, Sverdlov moved to a different village, moving in with his friend Filipp Goloshchyokin, known as Georges. In early 1917, Sverdlov received news of the Putilov strike of 1917 in Petrograd. Alongside Filipp, he set out for Petrograd at once, arriving to Petrograd on March 29, 1917 Party leader 195x195px After the 1917 February Revolution Sverdlov returned to Petrograd from exile as head of the Urals Delegation and found his way into Lenin's inner circle. He first met Lenin in April 1917 and subsequently usurped Elena Stasova as the chairman of the Central Committee Secretariat, and became the secretary of the Central Committee of the Party. According to Podvoisky, the chairperson of the Military Revolutionary Committee, \\"The person who did more than anyone to help Lenin with the practicalities of translating convictions into votes was Sverdlov.\\" As chairman of the Central Committee, Yakov played an important role in planning the October Revolution and helped make the decision to stage an armed uprising. In November as the Bolsheviks debated whether to postpone or hold elections, Sverdlov advocated for immediate elections as promised. When the results came back showing that the Socialist Revolutionaries had won, Sverdlov, Lenin, and Bukharin dissolved the assembly leading to a civil war. Sverdlov is sometimes regarded as the first head of state of the Soviet Union although it was not established until 1922, three years after his death. Sverdlov had a prodigious memory and was able to retain the names and details of fellow revolutionaries in exile. He often gave positions to those he knew personally without much regard for their qualifications. He promoted his friend and suite-mate Varlam Avanesov to second-in-command at the Central Executive Committee, and would later become a top official of the secret police. He also installed Vladimir Volodarsky as commissar of print, propaganda, and agitation until his assassination in 1918. His organizational capability was well-regarded, and during his chairmanship, thousands of local party committees were initiated. One of his comrades recalled that, > \\"[He] could tell you everything you needed to know about a comrade: where he > was working, what kind of person he was, what he was good at, and what job > he should be assigned to in the interests of the cause and for his benefit. > Moreover, Sverdlov had a very precise impression of all the comrades: they > were so firmly stamped in his memory that he could tell you all about the > company each one kept. It is hard to believe, but true.\\"Page 134, Sverdlov was elected chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee in November 1917, of which his wife was also a part, becoming thereby de jure head of state of the Russian SFSR until his death. He played important roles in the decision in January 1918 to end the Russian Constituent Assembly and the subsequent signing on 3 March of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. In March 1918 Sverdlov along with most prominent Bolsheviks fled Petrograd and moved the government headquarters to Moscow‚Äìthe Sverdlov's moved into a room in the Kremlin.Page 147, In March 1918 Sverdlov and the Central Executive Committee discussed how to best remove the \\"ulcers that socialism has inherited from capitalism\\" and Yakov advocated for a concentrated effort to turn the poorest peasants in the villages against their kulak brethren. Alongside Bukharin, the party began a campaign of \\"concentrated violence\\" against many members of the landowning, capitalist, and tradesman classes of Russian society.Page 154, =Romanov family= A number of sources claim that Sverdlov, alongside Lenin and Goloshchyokin, played a major role in the execution of Tsar Nicholas II and his family on 17 July 1918. Yakov Sverdlov and 205x205px A book written in 1990 by the Moscow playwright Edvard Radzinsky claims that Sverdlov ordered their execution on 16 July 1918.

However Yuri Slezkine in his book The Jewish Century expressed a slightly different opinion: \\"Early in the Civil War, in June 1918, Lenin ordered the killing of Nicholas II and his family. Among the men entrusted with carrying out the orders were Sverdlov, Filipp Goloshchyokin and Yakov Yurovsky\\".Page 154, The 1922 book by a White Army general, Mikhail Diterikhs, The Murder of the Tsar's Family and members of the House of Romanov in the Urals, sought to portray the murder of the royal family as a Jewish plot against Russia. It referred to Sverdlov by his Jewish nickname \\"Yankel\\" and to Goloshchekin as \\"Isaac\\". This book in turn was based on an account by one Nikolai Sokolov, special investigator for the Omsk regional court, whom Diterikhs assigned with the task of investigating the disappearance of the Romanovs while serving as regional governor under the White regime during the Russian Civil War. The investigating magistrate in Ekaterinburg in 1918 saw the signed telegraphic instructions to execute the Imperial Family came from Sverdlov. These details were published in 1966.Alexandrov, Victor, The End of the Romanovs, Hutchinson, London, 1966, p.226-230. According to Leon Trotsky's diaries, after returning from the front (of the Russian Civil War) he had the following dialogue with Sverdlov:–õ–µ–≤ –¢—Ä–æ—Ü–∫–∏–π, \\"–î–Ω–µ–≤–Ω–∏–∫–∏ –∏ –ø–∏—Å—å–º–∞\\", –≠—Ä–º–∏—Ç–∞–∂, 1986, pp. 100-101 = The Red Terror and Decossackization = Following the assassination of Moisei Uritsky and the assassination attempt on Lenin in August of 1918, Sverdlov drafted a document that called for \\"merciless mass terror against all the enemies of the revolution.\\"Page 158, Under his and Lenin's leadership, the Central Executive Committee adopted Sverdlov's resolution calling for \\"mass red terror against the bourgeoisie and its agents.\\" During Lenin's recovery Sverdlov moved into Lenin's office in the Kremlin and took over some of Lenin's official obligations. He oversaw the interrogation of Lenin's would-be assassin, Fanny Kaplan, and even moved Kaplan from the Cheka headquarters to be held in a basement room underneath Sverdlov's apartment. Sverdlov's deputy Avanesov gave the order for Kaplan's execution and Sverdlov himself personally ordered that the body be \\"destroyed without a trace.\\"Page 159, Sverdlov supported the Red Terror campaign, specifically when it came to the policy of decossackization that was started in 1917 as a part of the Russian Civil War. This policy resulted in the deaths of thousands of Cossacks, while the Soviet government confiscated land and food produced by the Cossack population. Sverdlov wrote that \\"not a single crime against the revolutionary military spirit will remain unpunished,\\" and that the release of Cossack prisoners was unacceptable.Page 163, Sverdlov even directed local officials to set up concentration camps in order to use Cossack labor before their extermination. This policy was temporarily suspended in March of 1919 while Sverdlov was in Ukraine overseeing the election of the Ukrainian Communist Party's central committee. Death Snow- covered statue of Sverdlov in left Sverdlov is commonly believed to have died of either typhus or most likely influenza, during the Spanish Flu, after a political visit to the Ukraine and Oryol. Kremlin doctors diagnosed him with the Spanish flu. Even as his illness progressed, he continued to perform his duties as chairman of the Central Committee. On March 14th, 1919 Sverdlov lost consciousness and on the 16th he died at the age of 33.Page 164, He is buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, in Moscow. He was succeeded in an interim capacity by Mikhail Vladimirsky, and eventually by Mikhail Kalinin as Chairman of the Central Executive Committee, and by Elena Stasova as Chairwoman of the Secretariat. Legacy * In a speech on March 18th, 1919 Vladimir Lenin praised Sverdlov and his contributions to the revolution. He called Sverdlov \\"the most perfectly complete type of professional revolutionary.\\"Page 164, * The Imperial Russian Navy destroyer leader Novik (commissioned during 1913) was renamed Yakov Sverdlov during 1923. * The first ship of the Sverdlov class cruisers was also named after him. * Yekaterinburg, dubbed the \\"third capital of Russia\\", as it is ranked third by the size of economy, culture, transportation and tourism, was renamed \\"Sverdlovsk\\" in 1924 and returned to its former name in 1991. * In 1938 a number of Ukrainian settlements as well as the Sverdlov mine (part of Sverdlovantratsyt company in 2010s) were merged into the city of Sverdlovsk, which the Ukrainian government renamed Dovzhansk on 12 May 2016, although the renaming could not be enforced due to the War in Donbass. * A few locations in the former Soviet Union still bear Sverdlov's name, in the Russian Federation and in Kyrgyzstan.

He is styled as His Beatitude the Archbishop of Cetinje and Metropolitan of Montenegro.  Life  = Early life = Mihailo was born Mira≈° Dedeiƒá (–ú–∏—Ä–∞—à –î–µ–¥–µ–∏—õ) on 8 November 1938 in the village Ramovo ≈Ωdrijelo in the Zeta Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, to Mlaƒëen Dedeiƒá and Saveta Deliba≈°iƒá. Dedeiƒá's family is from Njegovuƒëe, but their ancestors, originally of the Drobnjaci tribe, moved to Dobrilovina in the early 16th century. On 20 November 1938 he was baptized by a Serbian Orthodox priest Niko Paviƒçiƒá in the Church of Saint Transfiguration of Lord in the nearby village of . His godfather was Krsto Bajƒçeta. Dedeiƒá finished elementary school in Toma≈°evo- ≈†ahoviƒái. At the age of 21, after World War II, he joined the Serbian Orthodox Seminary of Prizren. He completed only two grades, later claiming that he was forced to abandon his education because he identified as a Montenegrin, and not a Serb. Instead, he finished the Real Classical High School of Prizren. Afterwards he enrolled in the study of pedagogy at the University of Pri≈°tina, but having always wished for a career in theology, he asked the then Bishop of Ra≈°ka and Prizren Pavle of the Serbian Orthodox Church for assistance, who gave him his blessing. Dedeiƒá joined the Faculty of Orthodox Theology University of Belgrade on 16 September 1965. He studied as an irregular student and finished exams under the mentorship of professor ƒåedomir Dra≈°koviƒá. He graduated in 1969. = Various jobs = On 11 November 1969 the Holy Synod of the SOC appointed Dedeiƒá assistant teacher for the monastic school at Ostrog Monastery. The then Metropolitan of Montenegro and the Littoral Danilo Dajkoviƒá was his opponent and was against this, managing to get him fired on 6 October 1970. Professor ƒåedomir Dra≈°koviƒá, whom he befriended, enrolled him at the Pontifical Oriental Institute in Rome, from which he graduated on 23 June 1973. Metropolitan Danilo was against this, but prof Dr Ivan ≈Ωu≈æek, a Catholic canonist, managed to defend him. The Metropolitan was a critic of the communist regime and of Dra≈°koviƒá, who had remained close to the League of Communists. He also criticized Dedeiƒá's poor school ratings. Dedeiƒá submitted a doctorate request to a Slovenian professor at the college, Dr Leskovac, but his application was rejected. After attempting to enroll at a post-graduate course at the Russian Spiritual Academy of Saint Serge in Zagorsk, he dropped them and then turned to Montenegro. Dra≈°koviƒá helped Dedeiƒá find employment at the State Archive of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on 31 January 1975, where he was subsequently sent by an academician of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) Vaso ƒåubriloviƒá and he set off to work for Director Mazayef. On 18 June 1975 he was given access to the Shchedrin Library at Leningrad. He then worked for the SANU Department of History, as ƒåubriloviƒá employed him to collect data from the period between 16th and 18th centuries from the Archive of Trieste. On 19 April 1982 Serbian academician Radovan Samard≈æiƒá recommended him to the State Archive of Italy and he was employed by the Italian Foreign Ministry to work on the collection of sources in the Vatican Secret Archives, the Archive of the Propaganda Fide and the Venetian Archive. In Italy he married Rosana, a nurse employed in eldercare, and moved in with her. = Priest = In June 1984 Dedeiƒá attempted to enroll in ecclesiastic service, specifically at Ostrog Monastery. He was preparing to take his monastic vows in the Serbian Orthodox Church, but Metropolitan Danilo was strictly against it and overruled the act. Searching elsewhere, he was ordained a priest in the Church of Holy Trinity in Vienna on 30 June 1988 by Greek Orthodox Metropolitan of Austria and Exarch of Italy and Hungary Chrysostom. Dedeiƒá spent almost the entire following decade as a Greek-Orthodox priest in Rome. He managed to gather the Orthodox Serb community in Rome and found the Serbian-Orthodox Municipality in Rome. He secured the permission from the Ecumenical Patriarch Spiridon to hold liturgic service in the local Greek Church of Saint Andrew in Serbian. In 1991 Dedeiƒá held a discussion with Croatian expert Dr Marin Kinel on Serbo-Croatian relations, in the outcome of the war. Mira≈° Dedeiƒá became a proponent of Serbian nationalism, he magnified Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá as the savior of the Serb people, reintegrating Kosovo and Vojvodina. He justified the assault of the Yugoslav People's Army on Dubrovnik and a historical Montenegrin right to it, as well as Italy's right to Istria and Dalmatia. He blamed the Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman for outcome of conflict, calling him \\"The Balkan Hitler\\". Following various rumors about him, the Ecclesiastical Court suspended him of all priestly ordains for an undetermined period in 1994 on the proposition of Metropolitan Spiridon (approved, November 1995), the final point being creation of a Serb-Orthodox Municipality out of the Greek Orthodox Church as his personal domain. On 16 May 1995 Dedeiƒá wrote to the Serbian Orthodox Metropolitan of Zagreb-Ljubljana and All of Italy Jovan to accept his service in the SOC, but his pleas were ignored. During the 1992-1995 Bosnian war, Dedeiƒá had been fundraising to support the Army of the Serb Republic under Ratko Mladiƒá's command during his plight to support the Serbs fighting the Bosnian Muslims and Croats. = Head of MOC = With the death of the head of the unrecognized Montenegrin Orthodox Church Antonije Abramoviƒá in 1996, Sreten Peroviƒá introduced Dedeiƒá to the Montenegrin Orthodox public and Dedeiƒá expressed joy for the recreation of a MOC, explaining how angry he was at the horrible way the SOC treated him so far and particularly at his future prime opponent, Metropolitan Amfilohije of Montenegro and the Littoral. He was thus elected at a Montenegrin National Gathering on 6 January 1997 as the new head of the unrecognized MOC by a crown of followers in Cetinje and on 27 January 1997 he resigned from the GOC. The gathering featured far fewer people than from back the last time under his predecessor Antonije Abramoviƒá, as back then it was a sign of a liberal struggle against the authoritarian regime of Momir Bulatoviƒá, Milo ƒêukanoviƒá and Svetozar Maroviƒá heavily influenced by the Serbian President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. This was swiftly followed by his full-scale excommunication and an anathema from the community of the Eastern Orthodox Church by decree of the Ecumenical Holy Synod on 9 April 1997. In 1997, ƒêukanoviƒá defeated pro-Serbian prot√©g√© Bulatoviƒá in presidential elections, leading to a change in treatment of the MOC. Dedeiƒá managed to register his Church as a non-governmental organization in the Cetinje local police station. Soon afterwards in 1998 he was made a monk and archimandrite by the likewise unrecognized Macedonian Orthodox Church, but it refused to give him the title of Bishop, in order to maintain good relations with the Serbian Orthodox Church from which it separated. Dedeiƒá found it in the likewise unrecognized Bulgarian Alternative Orthodox Church. The same year, he was made Bishop of Cetinje by the excommunicated Patriarch Pimen and seven Metropolitans and Bishops of his Church. On 23 November 1999 Mihailo attempted to do what his predecessor failed and submitted himself a request for official recognition as one of the religious communities in the Republic of Montenegro. After the request was again ignored, Dedeiƒá brought the matter to the Courts, eventually winning the dispute and having the MOC officially registered on 17 January 2000. Leading his Church in communion with the uncannonical Orthodox Christian world, the Kyiv-based Ukrainian Orthodox Church; it was in communion with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, however since 2006 it is within the process of restoration into the cannon Russian Orthodox Church. Dedeiƒá's appointment for head of the MOC was not without controversy. The Board for the Restoration of Autocephaly of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church, a sovereignist NGO dedicated to reestablishing a separate Montenegrin Church, did not approve it. Its president Dr Danilo Radojeviƒá was strictly against it, specifically because of Dedeiƒá's controversies in Italy and Serb nationalist past. In 1999, the Montenegrin Orthodox Church received a Constitution under Mihailo, who subsequently proclaimed himself Archbishop of Cetinje. Support from the new directive Montenegrin authorities waned, and official Montenegro strictly separated itself from any support of the MOC, the country's President Filip Vujanoviƒá explicitly defends the SOC's stand. Supported once only by the now disbanded Liberal Alliance of Montenegro, MOC found political support in the reigning side within the Social Democratic Party of Montenegro and the Croatian Civic Initiative and the Liberal Party of Montenegro in the opposition. Since 2005, Mihailo headed the construction of the first MOC shrines in Montenegro, but also in Serbia, where its supporter the \\"Krsta≈°\\" Association of Ethnic Montenegrins is very active in Vojvodina. At the 2006 referendum in which Montenegro chose independence from its state union with Serbia, Mihailo officially supported the \\"Yes\\" option. Afterwards, the Church announced a new directive, laying claim to all Serbian Orthodox monasteries and churches in Montenegro built before 1918 and those built afterwards with funds achieved in Montenegro, leading to a greater conflict with the legal Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral. On 11 January 2007 the Church's organization came closer to completion, as a Holy Synod was formed under Mihailo, and the territory of Montenegro was hierarchically split onto 5 dioceses. In 2007, Mihailo attempted to seize Be≈°ki from the SOC with a group of followers, after which he was sued by the Montenegrin Metropolitanate. Facing a trial at the local court of Bar, he was found guilty of disturbance of peace, the appeal was rejected and he received a restraint order banning him approach to the Serbian Orthodox Church. The same year he attempted to seize the Metropolitanate's seat, the Cetinje Monastery, with several hundred supporters. At the incident they clashed with the Montenegrin Police Forces which secured the monastery entry points on special order of the Government. Some of chants including those of Mihailo was interpreted as aggressive threats, while they were trying to brake in, and the event was sharply criticized by the public. In 2008, the MOC wanted to register in Serbia, but was rejected, however the Serbian Supreme Court overruled the act deeming it unconstitutional. The conflict between the two religious groups in Montenegro again reached climate point when the local authorities of the Cetinje Municipality confiscated SOC property in Cetinje and granted it to the MOC. This situation now means that the relics of Saint John the Baptist are held de facto by Mihailo, much to the anguish of the Royal Family of Serbia and the Order of Saint John. Talks are currently underway with the Vatican to hand over the relics. But some consider that the rightful owners are the church authorities in Malta. During Dedeiƒá's pastoral visit in Argentina in 2007, the Metropolitan Mihailo met Cardinal Bergoglio, who later became Pope Francis.  Personal life  Besides Dedeiƒá's native Montenegrin, Dedeiƒá is fluent in Italian, Russian and Greek, while he can also understand French and translate Latin. He is a personal friend of the successor to the Italian throne Umberto II; he worked in Umberto's Archive in his villa in the tiny Portuguese city of Cascais, searching for documents regarding Umberto's mother Helen (Jelena), Princess of Montenegro. Metropolitan Mihailo resides at Cetinje.

In the Kalevala she was also occasionally called Luonnotar, which means \\"female spirit of nature\\" (Finnish luonto, \\"nature\\").L√∂nnrot, Elias, compiler.

She was impregnated by the sea and wind and thus became the mother of V√§in√§m√∂inen. Ilmatar by , 1913‚Äì1916 Sibelius‚Äôs Luonnotar Jean Sibelius composed the tone poem Luonnotar, for soprano and orchestra in 1913. In this work, the mythical origin of the land and sky, recounted in craggy verses from the Kalevala, becomes an intense Sibelian metaphor for the inexorable force--even the terror of all creation--including that of the artist. One of the composer's most compelling works, it alternates between two musical ideas. As heard at the outset, these are the shimmering stirrings of ever-growing possibility; and, underpinned with dissonant, static, harp strokes, the even more incantatory, distressed cries of the \\"nature spirit\\" (Luonnotar) herself, heavy with child.

Displacement current density has the same units as electric current density, and it is a source of the magnetic field just as actual current is. However it is not an electric current of moving charges, but a time-varying electric field. In physical materials (as opposed to vacuum), there is also a contribution from the slight motion of charges bound in atoms, called dielectric polarization. The idea was conceived by James Clerk Maxwell in his 1861 paper On Physical Lines of Force, Part III in connection with the displacement of electric particles in a dielectric medium. Maxwell added displacement current to the electric current term in Amp√®re's Circuital Law. In his 1865 paper A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field Maxwell used this amended version of Amp√®re's Circuital Law to derive the electromagnetic wave equation. This derivation is now generally accepted as a historical landmark in physics by virtue of uniting electricity, magnetism and optics into one single unified theory. The displacement current term is now seen as a crucial addition that completed Maxwell's equations and is necessary to explain many phenomena, most particularly the existence of electromagnetic waves.  Explanation  The electric displacement field is defined as: : \\\\boldsymbol{D} = \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\boldsymbol{E} + \\\\boldsymbol{P}\\\\ . where: :Œµ0 is the permittivity of free space :E is the electric field intensity :P is the polarization of the medium Differentiating this equation with respect to time defines the displacement current density, which therefore has two components in a dielectric:(see also the \\"displacement current\\" section of the article \\"current density\\") : \\\\boldsymbol{J}_ \\\\boldsymbol{D} = \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{E}}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{P}}{\\\\partial t}\\\\ . The first term on the right hand side is present in material media and in free space. It doesn't necessarily come from any actual movement of charge, but it does have an associated magnetic field, just as a current does due to charge motion. Some authors apply the name displacement current to the first term by itself.For example, see and The second term on the right hand side, called polarization current density, comes from the change in polarization of the individual molecules of the dielectric material. Polarization results when, under the influence of an applied electric field, the charges in molecules have moved from a position of exact cancellation. The positive and negative charges in molecules separate, causing an increase in the state of polarization P. A changing state of polarization corresponds to charge movement and so is equivalent to a current, hence the term \\"polarization current\\". Thus, \\\\boldsymbol{I}_ \\\\boldsymbol{D} =\\\\iint_{\\\\mathcal S}\\\\boldsymbol{J}_ \\\\boldsymbol{D}\\\\cdot\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!\\\\boldsymbol{S}=\\\\iint_{\\\\mathcal S}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{D}}{\\\\partial t}\\\\cdot\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!\\\\boldsymbol{S}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial t}\\\\iint_{\\\\mathcal S} \\\\boldsymbol{D}\\\\cdot\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!\\\\boldsymbol{S}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi_D}{\\\\partial t}\\\\\\\\! This polarization is the displacement current as it was originally conceived by Maxwell. Maxwell made no special treatment of the vacuum, treating it as a material medium. For Maxwell, the effect of P was simply to change the relative permittivity Œµr in the relation D = ŒµrŒµ0 E. The modern justification of displacement current is explained below. =Isotropic dielectric case= In the case of a very simple dielectric material the constitutive relation holds: : \\\\boldsymbol{D} = \\\\varepsilon \\\\boldsymbol{E} \\\\ , where the permittivity Œµ = Œµ0 Œµr, * Œµr is the relative permittivity of the dielectric and * Œµ0 is the electric constant. In this equation the use of Œµ accounts for the polarization of the dielectric. The scalar value of displacement current may also be expressed in terms of electric flux: : I_\\\\mathrm{D} =\\\\varepsilon \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi_E}{\\\\partial t}. The forms in terms of Œµ are correct only for linear isotropic materials. More generally Œµ may be replaced by a tensor, may depend upon the electric field itself, and may exhibit frequency dependence (dispersion). For a linear isotropic dielectric, the polarization P is given by: :\\\\boldsymbol{P} = \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\chi_e \\\\boldsymbol{E} = \\\\varepsilon_0 (\\\\varepsilon_r - 1) \\\\boldsymbol{E} where œáe is known as the electric susceptibility of the dielectric. Note that: :\\\\varepsilon = \\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0 = (1+\\\\chi_e)\\\\varepsilon_0. Necessity Some implications of the displacement current follow, which agree with experimental observation, and with the requirements of logical consistency for the theory of electromagnetism. =Generalizing Amp√®re's circuital law= Current in capacitors An example illustrating the need for the displacement current arises in connection with capacitors with no medium between the plates. Consider the charging capacitor in the figure. The capacitor is in a circuit that causes equal and opposite charges to appear on the left plate and the right plate, charging the capacitor and increasing the electric field between its plates. No actual charge is transported through the vacuum between its plates. Nonetheless, a magnetic field exists between the plates as though a current were present there as well. One explanation is that a displacement current ID \\"flows\\" in the vacuum, and this current produces the magnetic field in the region between the plates according to Amp√®re's law: An electrically charging capacitor with an imaginary cylindrical surface surrounding the left-hand plate. Right-hand surface R lies in the space between the plates and left-hand surface L lies to the left of the left plate. No conduction current enters cylinder surface R, while current I leaves through surface L. Consistency of Amp√®re's law requires a displacement current ID = I to flow across surface R. :\\\\oint_C \\\\mathbf{B}\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{ \\\\cdot}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\ell} = \\\\mu_0 I_D \\\\ . where :*\\\\oint_C is the closed line integral around some closed curve C. :*\\\\mathbf{B} is the magnetic field measured in teslas. :* \\\\boldsymbol{ \\\\cdot}\\\\ is the vector dot product. :*\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\ell} is an infinitesimal line element along the curve C, that is, a vector with magnitude equal to the length element of C, and direction given by the tangent to the curve C. :*\\\\mu_0 \\\\\\\\!\\\\ is the magnetic constant, also called the permeability of free space. :*I_D \\\\\\\\!\\\\ is the net displacement current that passes through a small surface bounded by the curve C. The magnetic field between the plates is the same as that outside the plates, so the displacement current must be the same as the conduction current in the wires, that is, :I_D = I \\\\ , which extends the notion of current beyond a mere transport of charge. Next, this displacement current is related to the charging of the capacitor. Consider the current in the imaginary cylindrical surface shown surrounding the left plate. A current, say I, passes outward through the left surface L of the cylinder, but no conduction current (no transport of real charges) crosses the right surface R. Notice that the electric field between the plates E increases as the capacitor charges. That is, in a manner described by Gauss's law, assuming no dielectric between the plates: : Q(t) =\\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\oint_{\\\\mathcal S} d \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathcal S} \\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{ \\\\cdot} \\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{ E} (t) \\\\ , where S refers to the imaginary cylindrical surface. Assuming a parallel plate capacitor with uniform electric field, and neglecting fringing effects around the edges of the plates, according to charge conservation equation : I=-\\\\frac {dQ}{dt} =- \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\oint_{\\\\mathcal \\\\boldsymbol S} d \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathcal S} \\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{ \\\\cdot} \\\\ \\\\frac {\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol {E} }{\\\\partial t }= { S}\\\\ \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\left. \\\\frac {\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial t} \\\\right_R \\\\ , where the first term has a negative sign because charge leaves surface L (the charge is decreasing), the last term has a positive sign because unit vector of surface R is from left to right while the direction of electric field is from right to left, S is the area of the surface R. The electric field at surface L is zero because surface L is in the outside of the capacitor. Under the assumption of a uniform electric field distribution inside the capacitor, the displacement current density JD is found by dividing by the area of the surface: : J_D = \\\\frac{I_D}{ S}= \\\\frac{I}{ S}= \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\frac {\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\frac {\\\\partial D}{\\\\partial t} \\\\ , where I is the current leaving the cylindrical surface (which must equal ID) and JD is the flow of charge per unit area into the cylindrical surface through the face R. Combining these results, the magnetic field is found using the integral form of Amp√®re's law with an arbitrary choice of contour provided the displacement current density term is added to the conduction current density (the Amp√®re-Maxwell equation): :\\\\oint_{\\\\partial S} \\\\boldsymbol{B} \\\\cdot d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\ell} = \\\\mu_0 \\\\int_S \\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{J} + \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\frac {\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{E}}{\\\\partial t}\\\\right) \\\\cdot d\\\\boldsymbol{S} \\\\, This equation says that the integral of the magnetic field B around a loop ‚àÇS is equal to the integrated current J through any surface spanning the loop, plus the displacement current term Œµ0 ‚àÇE / ‚àÇt through the surface. Example showing two surfaces S1 and S2 that share the same bounding contour ‚àÇS. However, S1 is pierced by conduction current, while S2 is pierced by displacement current. Surface S2 is closed under the capacitor plate. As depicted in the figure to the right, the current crossing surface S1 is entirely conduction current. Applying the Amp√®re-Maxwell equation to surface S1 yields: :B = \\\\frac {\\\\mu_0 I}{2 \\\\pi r}\\\\, However, the current crossing surface S2 is entirely displacement current. Applying this law to surface S2, which is bounded by exactly the same curve \\\\partial S , but lies between the plates, produces: :B = \\\\frac {\\\\mu_0 I_D}{2 \\\\pi r}\\\\, Any surface S1 that intersects the wire has current I passing through it so Amp√®re's law gives the correct magnetic field. However a second surface S2 bounded by the same loop Œ¥S could be drawn passing between the capacitor plates, therefore having no current passing through it. Without the displacement current term Ampere's law would give zero magnetic field for this surface. Therefore, without the displacement current term Ampere's law gives inconsistent results, the magnetic field would depend on the surface chosen for integration. Thus the displacement current term Œµ0 ‚àÇE / ‚àÇt is necessary as a second source term which gives the correct magnetic field when the surface of integration passes between the capacitor plates. Because the current is increasing the charge on the capacitor's plates, the electric field between the plates is increasing, and the rate of change of electric field gives the correct value for the field B found above. Mathematical formulation In a more mathematical vein, the same results can be obtained from the underlying differential equations. Consider for simplicity a non-magnetic medium where the relative magnetic permeability is unity, and the complication of magnetization current (bound current) is absent, so that M=0 and J=Jf. The current leaving a volume must equal the rate of decrease of charge in a volume. In differential form this continuity equation becomes: : abla \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{J_f} = -\\\\frac {\\\\partial \\\\rho_f}{\\\\partial t} \\\\ , where the left side is the divergence of the free current density and the right side is the rate of decrease of the free charge density. However, Amp√®re's law in its original form states: : \\\\boldsymbol{ abla \\\\times B} = \\\\mu_0 \\\\boldsymbol J_f \\\\ , which implies that the divergence of the current term vanishes, contradicting the continuity equation. (Vanishing of the divergence is a result of the mathematical identity that states the divergence of a curl is always zero.) This conflict is removed by addition of the displacement current, as then: : \\\\boldsymbol{ abla \\\\times B} = \\\\mu_0 \\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol J +\\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\frac {\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol E}{\\\\partial t}\\\\right) = \\\\mu_0 \\\\left( \\\\boldsymbol J_f +\\\\frac {\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol D}{\\\\partial t}\\\\right) \\\\ , and :\\\\boldsymbol{ abla \\\\cdot } \\\\left( \\\\boldsymbol{ abla \\\\times B}\\\\right ) = 0 = \\\\mu_0 \\\\left( abla \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol J_f +\\\\frac {\\\\partial }{\\\\partial t} \\\\boldsymbol { abla \\\\cdot D } \\\\right ) \\\\ , which is in agreement with the continuity equation because of Gauss's law: : \\\\boldsymbol { abla \\\\cdot D} = \\\\rho_f \\\\ . =Wave propagation= The added displacement current also leads to wave propagation by taking the curl of the equation for magnetic field. : \\\\boldsymbol{J_D} = \\\\epsilon_0\\\\frac { \\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{E} } { \\\\partial t } Substituting this form for J into Amp√®re's law, and assuming there is no bound or free current density contributing to J : : \\\\boldsymbol{ abla \\\\times B} = \\\\mu_0 \\\\boldsymbol {J_D} \\\\ , with the result: :\\\\boldsymbol{ abla \\\\times}\\\\left( \\\\boldsymbol { abla \\\\times B} \\\\right ) = \\\\mu_0 \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\frac {\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\boldsymbol { abla \\\\times E} \\\\ . However, :\\\\boldsymbol { abla \\\\times E} = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial t} \\\\boldsymbol B \\\\ , leading to the wave equation: :-\\\\boldsymbol{ abla \\\\times}\\\\left( \\\\boldsymbol { abla \\\\times B} \\\\right ) = abla^2 \\\\boldsymbol B =\\\\mu_0 \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\frac {\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial t^2} \\\\boldsymbol {B } = \\\\frac{1}{c^2} \\\\frac {\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial t^2} \\\\boldsymbol {B } \\\\ , where use is made of the vector identity that holds for any vector field V(r, t): :\\\\boldsymbol{ abla \\\\times}\\\\left( \\\\boldsymbol { abla \\\\times V}\\\\right ) = \\\\boldsymbol { abla}\\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{ abla \\\\cdot V}\\\\right ) - abla^2 \\\\boldsymbol V \\\\ , and the fact that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero. An identical wave equation can be found for the electric field by taking the curl: :\\\\boldsymbol { abla \\\\times } \\\\left( \\\\boldsymbol { abla \\\\times E} \\\\right) = -\\\\frac {\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}\\\\boldsymbol { abla \\\\times } \\\\boldsymbol{B}=-\\\\mu_0 \\\\frac {\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\left( \\\\boldsymbol J + \\\\epsilon_0\\\\frac {\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\boldsymbol E \\\\right) \\\\ . If J, P and œÅ are zero, the result is: : abla^2 \\\\boldsymbol E =\\\\mu_0 \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\frac {\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial t^2} \\\\boldsymbol {E } = \\\\frac{1}{c^2} \\\\frac {\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial t^2} \\\\boldsymbol {E } \\\\ . The electric field can be expressed in the general form: : \\\\boldsymbol{E} = - \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\varphi - \\\\frac { \\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{A} } { \\\\partial t } \\\\ , where œÜ is the electric potential (which can be chosen to satisfy Poisson's equation) and A is a vector potential (i.e. magnetic vector potential, not to be confused with Surface area, as A is denoted elsewhere). The ‚àáœÜ component on the right hand side is the Gauss's law component, and this is the component that is relevant to the conservation of charge argument above. The second term on the right- hand side is the one relevant to the electromagnetic wave equation, because it is the term that contributes to the curl of E. Because of the vector identity that says the curl of a gradient is zero, ‚àáœÜ does not contribute to ‚àá√óE.  History and interpretation  Maxwell's displacement current was postulated in part III of his 1861 paper 'On Physical Lines of Force'. Few topics in modern physics have caused as much confusion and misunderstanding as that of displacement current. This is in part due to the fact that Maxwell used a sea of molecular vortices in his derivation, while modern textbooks operate on the basis that displacement current can exist in free space. Maxwell's derivation is unrelated to the modern day derivation for displacement current in the vacuum, which is based on consistency between Ampere's circuital law for the magnetic field and the continuity equation for electric charge. Maxwell's purpose is stated by him at (Part I, p. 161): He is careful to point out the treatment is one of analogy: In part III, in relation to displacement current, he says Clearly Maxwell was driving at magnetization even though the same introduction clearly talks about dielectric polarization. Maxwell concluded, using Newton's equation for the speed of sound (Lines of Force, Part III, equation (132)), that ‚Äúlight consists of transverse undulations in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.‚Äù But although the above quotations point towards a magnetic explanation for displacement current, for example, based upon the divergence of the above curl equation, Maxwell's explanation ultimately stressed linear polarization of dielectrics: With some change of symbols (and units) combined with the results deduced in the section \\"Current in capacitors\\" : r ‚Üí J, R ‚Üí ‚àíE and the material constant E‚àí2 ‚Üí 4œÄ ŒµrŒµ0 these equations take the familiar form between a parallel plate capacitor with uniform electric field, and neglecting fringing effects around the edges of the plates: ::J = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\frac {1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\mathrm E^2} \\\\mathit E = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\varepsilon_r\\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\mathit E = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\mathit D \\\\ . When it came to deriving the electromagnetic wave equation from displacement current in his 1865 paper A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field, he got around the problem of the non-zero divergence associated with Gauss's law and dielectric displacement by eliminating the Gauss term and deriving the wave equation exclusively for the solenoidal magnetic field vector. Maxwell's emphasis on polarization diverted attention towards the electric capacitor circuit, and led to the common belief that Maxwell conceived of displacement current so as to maintain conservation of charge in an electric capacitor circuit. There are a variety of debatable notions about Maxwell's thinking, ranging from his supposed desire to perfect the symmetry of the field equations to the desire to achieve compatibility with the continuity equation.

It involved the United States Army's Signals Intelligence Service (SIS) and the United States Navy's Communication Special Unit. Codebreaking Magic was set up to combine the US government's cryptologic capabilities in one organization dubbed the Research Bureau. Intelligence officers from the Army and Navy (and later civilian experts and technicians) were all under one roof. Although they worked on a series of codes and cyphers, their most important successes involved RED, BLUE, and PURPLE. =RED= In 1923, a US Navy officer acquired a stolen copy of the Secret Operating Code codebook used by the Japanese Navy during World War I. Photographs of the codebook were given to the cryptanalysts at the Research Desk and the processed code was kept in red- colored folders (to indicate its Top Secret classification). This code was called \\"RED\\". =BLUE= In 1930, the Japanese government created a more complex code that was codenamed BLUE, although RED was still being used for low-level communications. It was quickly broken by the Research Desk no later than 1932. US Military Intelligence COMINT listening stations began monitoring command-to-fleet, ship-to-ship, and land-based communications. =PURPLE= After Japan's ally Germany declared war in the fall of 1939, the German government began sending technical assistance to upgrade their communications and cryptography capabilities. One part was to send them modified Enigma machines to secure Japan's high-level communications with Germany. The new code, codenamed PURPLE (from the color obtained by mixing red and blue), was baffling. PURPLE, like Enigma, began its communications with the same line of code but then became an unfathomable jumble. Codebreakers tried to break PURPLE communiques by hand but found they could not. Then the codebreakers realized that it was not a manual additive or substitution code like RED and BLUE, but a machine-generated code similar to Germany's Enigma cipher. Decoding was slow and much of the traffic was still hard to break. By the time the traffic was decoded and translated, the contents were often out of date. A reverse-engineered machine created in 1939 by a team of technicians led by William Friedman and Frank Rowlett could decrypt some of the PURPLE code by replicating some of the settings of the Japanese Enigma machines. This sped up decoding and the addition of more translators on staff in 1942 made it easier and quicker to decipher the traffic intercepted. PURPLE traffic The Japanese Foreign Office used a cipher machine to encrypt its diplomatic messages. The machine was called \\"PURPLE\\" by U.S. cryptographers. A message was typed into the machine, which enciphered and sent it to an identical machine. The receiving machine could decipher the message only if set to the correct settings, or keys. American cryptographers built a machine that could decrypt these messages. The PURPLE machine itself was first used by Japan in 1940. U.S. and British cryptographers had broken some PURPLE traffic well before the attack on Pearl Harbor. However, the PURPLE machines were used only by the Foreign Office to carry diplomatic traffic to its embassies. The Japanese Navy used a completely different crypto-system, known as JN-25. U.S. analysts discovered no hint in PURPLE of the impending Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor; nor could they, as the Japanese were very careful not to discuss their plan in Foreign Office communications. In fact, no detailed information about the planned attack was even available to the Japanese Foreign Office, as that agency was regarded by the military, particularly its more nationalist members, as insufficiently \\"reliable\\". U.S. access to private Japanese diplomatic communications (even the most secret ones) was less useful than it might otherwise have been because policy in prewar Japan was controlled largely by military groups like the Imperial Way Faction, and not by the Foreign Office. The Foreign Office itself deliberately withheld from its embassies and consulates much of the information it did have, so the ability to read PURPLE messages was less than definitive regarding Japanese tactical or strategic military intentions. U.S. cryptographers (see Station HYPO) had decrypted and translated the 14-part Japanese diplomatic message breaking off ongoing negotiations with the U.S. at 1 p.m. Washington time on 7 December 1941, even before the Japanese Embassy in Washington could do so. As a result of the deciphering and typing difficulties at the embassy, the note was delivered late to American Secretary of State Cordell Hull. When the two Japanese diplomats finally delivered the note, Hull had to pretend to be reading it for the first time, even though he already knew about the attack on Pearl Harbor. Throughout the war, the Allies routinely read both German and Japanese cryptography. The Japanese Ambassador to Germany, General Hiroshi ≈åshima, often sent priceless German military information to Tokyo. This information was routinely intercepted and read by Roosevelt, Churchill and Eisenhower. According to Lowman, \\"The Japanese considered the PURPLE system absolutely unbreakable‚Ä¶ Most went to their graves refusing to believe the [cipher] had been broken by analytic means‚Ä¶ They believed someone had betrayed their system.\\" Distribution prior to Pearl Harbor Even so, the diplomatic information was of more limited value to the U.S. because of its manner and its description. \\"Magic\\" was distributed in such a way that many policy-makers who had need of the information in it knew nothing of it, and those to whom it actually was distributed (at least before Pearl Harbor) saw each message only briefly, as the courier stood by to take it back, and in isolation from other messages (no copies or notes being permitted). Before Pearl Harbor, they saw only those decrypts thought \\"important enough\\" by the distributing Army or Navy officers. Nonetheless, being able to read PURPLE messages gave the Allies a great advantage in the war; for instance, the Japanese ambassador to Germany, Baron Hiroshi ≈åshima, produced long reports for Tokyo which were enciphered on the PURPLE machine. They included reports on personal discussions with Adolf Hitler and a report on a tour of the invasion defenses in Northern France (including the D-Day invasion beaches). General Marshall said that ≈åshima was \\"our main basis of... information regarding Hitler's intentions in Europe\\". Dewey and Marshall During the 1944 election, Thomas Dewey threatened to make Pearl Harbor a campaign issue, until General Marshall sent him a personal letter which said, in part: :To explain the critical nature of this set-up, which would be wiped out in an instant if the least suspicion were aroused regarding it, the Battle of Coral Sea was based on deciphered messages and therefore our few ships were in the right place at the right time. Further, we were able to concentrate our limited forces to meet their naval advance on Midway when otherwise we almost certainly would have been some out of place. We had full information on the strength of their forces. Dewey promised not to raise the issue, and kept his word. Post-war debates The break into the PURPLE system, and into Japanese messages generally, was the subject of acrimonious hearings in Congress post-World War II in connection with an attempt to decide who, if anyone, had allowed the disaster at Pearl Harbor to happen and who therefore should be blamed. During those hearings the Japanese learned, for the first time, the PURPLE cypher system had been broken. They had been continuing to use it, even after the War, with the encouragement of the American Occupation Government. Much confusion over who in Washington or Hawaii knew what and when, especially as \\"we were decrypting their messages,\\" has led some to conclude \\"someone in Washington\\" knew about the Pearl Harbor attack before it happened, and, since Pearl Harbor was not expecting to be attacked, the \\"failure to warn Hawaii one was coming must have been deliberate, since it could hardly have been mere oversight\\". However, PURPLE was a diplomatic, not a military code; thus, only inferences could be drawn from PURPLE as to specific Japanese military actions. History When PURPLE was broken by the U.S. Army's Signals Intelligence Service (SIS), several problems arose for the Americans: who would get the decrypts, which decrypts, how often, under what circumstances, and crucially (given interservice rivalries) who would do the delivering. Both the U.S. Navy and Army were insistent they alone handle all decrypted traffic delivery, especially to highly placed policy makers in the U.S. Eventually, after much to-ing and fro-ing, a compromise was reached: the Army would be responsible for the decrypts on one day, and the Navy the next. The distribution list eventually included some ‚Äî but not all ‚Äî military intelligence leaders in Washington and elsewhere, and some ‚Äî but, again, not all ‚Äî civilian policy leaders in Washington. The eventual routine for distribution included the following steps: *the duty officer (Army or Navy, depending on the day) would decide which decrypts were significant or interesting enough to distribute *they would be collected, locked into a briefcase, and turned over to a relatively junior officer (not always cleared to read the decrypts) who would 'make the rounds' to the appropriate offices. *no copies of any decrypts were left with anyone on the list. The recipient would be allowed to read the translated decrypt, in the presence of the distributing officer, and was required to return it immediately upon finishing. Before the beginning of the second week in December 1941, that was the last time anyone on the list saw that particular decrypt. Decryption process There were several prior steps needed before any decrypt was ready for distribution: # Interception. The Japanese Foreign Office used both wireless transmission and cables to communicate with its off shore units. Wireless transmission was intercepted (if possible) at any of several listening stations (Hawaii, Guam, Bainbridge Island in Washington state, Dutch Harbor on an Alaska island, etc.) and the raw cypher groups were forwarded to Washington, D.C. Eventually, there were decryption stations (including a copy of the Army's PURPLE machine) in the Philippines as well. Cable traffic was (for many years before late 1941) collected at cable company offices by a military officer who made copies and started them to Washington. Cable traffic in Hawaii was not intercepted due to legal concerns until David Sarnoff of RCA agreed to allow it during a visit to Hawaii the first week of December 1941. At one point, intercepts were being mailed to (Army or Navy) Intelligence from the field. # Deciphering. The raw intercept was deciphered by either the Army or the Navy (depending on the day). Deciphering was usually successful as the cipher had been broken. # Translation. Having obtained the plain text, in Latin letters, it was translated. Because the Navy had more Japanese-speaking officers, much of the burden of translation fell onto the Navy. And because Japanese is a difficult language, with meaning highly dependent upon context, effective translation required not only fluent Japanese, but considerable knowledge of the context within which the message was sent. # Evaluation. The translated decrypt had to be evaluated for its intelligence content. For example, is the ostensible content of the message meaningful? If it is, for instance, part of a power contest within the Foreign Office or some other part of the Japanese government, its meaning and implications would be quite different from a simple informational or instructional message to an Embassy. Or, might it be another message in a series whose meaning, taken together, is more than the meaning of any individual message. Thus, the fourteenth message to an Embassy instructing that Embassy to instruct Japanese merchant ships calling at that country to return to home waters before, say, the end of November would be more significant than a single such message meant for a single ship or port. Only after having evaluated a translated decrypt for its intelligence value could anyone decide whether it deserved to be distributed. In the period before the attack on Pearl Harbor, the material was handled awkwardly and inefficiently, and was distributed even more awkwardly. Nevertheless, the extraordinary experience of reading a foreign government's most closely held communications, sometimes even before the intended recipient, was astonishing. It was so astonishing, someone (possibly President Roosevelt) called it magic. The name stuck. Executive Order 9066 One aspect of Magic remains controversial to this day ‚Äî the amount of involvement the intercepts played in the issuing of United States Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, and subsequent Executive Order 9102 on March 18, which led to the creation of the Wartime Relocation Authority (WRA). This is often confused with the issue of internment, which was actually handled by the Justice Department's Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and affected all citizens of countries at war with the United States in any location. Internment of 'enemy aliens' by the U.S. government began two months prior to Executive Order 9066 on December 8, 1941, immediately after the attack at Pearl Harbor and included Germans and Italians, and not just the Japanese living on the U.S. West Coast.Stephen Fox, \\"The Unknown Internment: An Oral History of the Relocation of Italian Americans during World War II\\" David Lowman in his book MAGIC: the Untold Story reports that the primary justification for the Japanese-American relocations and internments was to protect against espionage and sabotage, because Magic could not be mentioned during the war. Those defending the decision to evacuate and relocate when seen in context, notably blogger and investigative reporter Michelle Malkin, point to Magic intercepts as partial justification for EO 9066. Malkin cites 1984 testimony of the Undersecretary with the most Magic knowledge, who statedJAAWR Hearings (1984) that Magic \\"was a very important factor\\" in their considerations. Extensive additional primary source documents are cited in Malkin's book In Defense of InternmentMalkin (2004), cf entire chapters on subversives, spies, MAGIC, and the rationale for evacuation to argue that Magic intercepts discuss the development of a spy ring among Japanese Americans by the Japanese consulates, provide the type of espionage data being sent to Japan, and much more which raised a suspicion that many thousands in the Japanese American community were an espionage risk, including members of Kibei, Issei and Nisei. In 1988, Congress passed and President Ronald Reagan signed legislation that apologized for the internment on behalf of the U.S. government. The legislation said that government actions were based on \\"race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership\\".100th Congress, S. 1009, reproduced at Internment archives. Retrieved September 19, 2006. The hearings that produced this decision did not take into account the Magic intercepts. The following is the actual text of several Magic intercepts translated into English before and during the war and declassified and made public in 1978 by the U.S. government (The Magic Background of Pearl Harbor:, Government Printing Office, 8 volumes) =Tokyo to Washington= ;Magic intercept Tokyo to Washington #44 ‚Äì Jan 30, 1941 Intercept dated January 30, 1941 and noted as translated 2-7-41 Numbered #44 =Japanese U.S. consulates to Tokyo= Throughout the rest of 1941, some of the messages between Tokyo and its embassies and consulates continued to be intercepted. In response to the ordered shift from propaganda efforts to espionage collection, the Japanese consulates throughout the western hemisphere reported their information normally through the use of diplomatic channels, but when time- sensitive through the use of PURPLE encoded messages. This provided vital clues to their progress directly to the U.S. President and his top advisers. Intercepts in May 1941 from the consulates in Los Angeles and Seattle report that the Japanese were having success in obtaining information and cooperation from \\"second generation\\" Japanese Americans and others. ;Magic intercept LA to Tokyo #067 - May 9, 1941 Intercept dated May 9, 1941 and translated 5-19-41 Numbered #067 ;Magic intercept Seattle to Tokyo #45 - May 11, 1941 Intercept dated May 11, 1941 and translated 6-9-41 Numbered # 45 =Access by Roosevelt's cabinet= These intercepts plus other reports from the FBI and the Office of Naval Intelligence counter-espionage efforts, the TACHIBANA espionage case during summer 1941, FBI efforts against Japanese Yakuza throughout the 1930s along the West Coast (the TOKOYO and TOYO CLUBs) were all available only to the most senior leaders in the Roosevelt cabinet. Even J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI, was not privy to the existence of Magic intelligence. =Opposing viewpoint= Those who consider that Executive Order 9066 regarding Japanese American internment was not based on Magic intercepts, argue: *the commanding officer on the West coast, Lt. Gen. J. L. DeWitt, was not on the Magic intercept list, *his superior, Secretary of War Henry Stimson, was on the intercept list, and *Stimson requested justification for the relocation program from DeWitt. *If Magic intercepts provided justification, why ask DeWitt for further justification? One theory is that Stimson wanted DeWitt to provide justifications that could be made public, because the Magic intercepts could not be made public. The issue was inflamed due to the release of Malkin's 2004 book, In Defense of Internment, in which the Magic intercepts play a major role in the defense of her thesis. Other Japanese ciphers PURPLE was an enticing, but quite tactically limited, window into Japanese planning and policy because of the peculiar nature of Japanese policy making prior to the War (see above). Early on, a better tactical window was the Japanese Fleet Code (an encoded cypher), called JN-25 by U.S. Navy cryptanalysts. Breaking into the version in use in the months after December 7, 1941 provided enough information to lead to U.S. naval victories in the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway, stopping the initial Japanese advances to the south and eliminating the bulk of Japanese naval air power. Later, broken JN-25 traffic also provided the schedule and routing of the plane Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto would be flying in during an inspection tour in the southwest Pacific, giving USAAF pilots a chance to ambush the officer who had conceived the Pearl Harbor attack. And still later, access to Japanese Army messages from decrypts of Army communications traffic assisted in planning the island hopping campaign to the Philippines and beyond. Another source of information was the Japanese Military Attach√© code (known as JMA to the Allies) introduced in 1941. This was a fractionating transposition system based on two-letter code groups which stood for common words and phrases. The groups were written in a square grid according to an irregular pattern and read off vertically, similar to a disrupted columnar transposition. Then the letters were superenciphered using a pre-arranged table of alphabets. This system was broken by John Tiltman at Bletchley Park in 1942. Other claimed breaks into PURPLE The 1992 book The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB, by Christopher Andrew, based on the Mitrokhin Archive smuggled out of Russia in the early 1990s by a KGB archivist, contains information about wartime Soviet knowledge of Japanese enciphered transmissions. It claims that the Soviets independently broke into Japanese PURPLE traffic (as well as the Red predecessor machine), and that decrypted PURPLE messages contributed to the decision by Stalin to move troops from Far Eastern Asia to the area around Moscow for the counterattack against Germany in December 1941 as the messages convinced the Soviet government that there would not be a Japanese attack. How secret was Magic? Public notice had actually been served that Japanese cryptography was dangerously inadequate by the Chicago Tribune, which published a series of stories just after Midway, starting on 7 June 1942, which claimed (correctly) that victory was due in large part to the U.S. breaking into Japanese crypto systems (in this case, the JN-25 cypher, though which system(s) had been broken was not mentioned in the newspaper stories). The Tribune claimed the story was written by Stanley Johnston from his own knowledge (and Jane's), but Ronald Lewin points out that the story repeats the layout and errors of a signal from Admiral Nimitz which Johnston saw while on the transport Barnett. Nimitz was reprimanded by Admiral King for sending the dispatch to Task Force commanders on a channel available to nearly all ships. The Lexington's executive officer, Commander Morton T. Seligman was assigned to shore duty and retired early. However, neither the Japanese nor anyone who might have told them seem to have noticed either the Tribune coverage, or the stories based on the Tribune account published in other U.S. papers. Nor did they notice announcements made on the floor of the United States Congress to the same effect. There were no changes in Japanese cryptography connected with those newspaper accounts or Congressional disclosures. Alvin Kernan was an aviation ordnanceman on board the aircraft carriers and the during the war. During that time, he was awarded the Navy Cross. In his book, Crossing the Line, he states that when the carrier returned to Pearl Harbor to resupply before the Battle of Midway, the crew knew that the Japanese code had been broken and that U.S. naval forces were preparing to engage the Japanese fleet at Midway. He insists that he \\"‚Ä¶exactly remembers the occasion on which I was told, with full details about ships and dates‚Ä¶\\" despite the later insistence that the breaking of the code was kept secret. U.S. Navy Commander I.J. Galantin, who retired as an Admiral, refers several times to Magic in his 1988 book about his Pacific theater war patrols as captain of the U.S. submarine . However, Galantin refers to Magic as \\"Ultra\\" which was actually the name given to the breaking of the German code. Upon receiving one message from Pacific Fleet command, directing him off normal station to intercept Japanese vessels due to a Magic message, Galantin writes. \\"I had written my night orders carefully. I made no reference to Ultra and stressed only the need to be very alert for targets in this fruitful area\\". Galantin had previously mentioned in his book that all submarine captains were aware of \\"Ultra\\" (Magic). In addition, Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall discovered early in the war that Magic documents were being widely read at the White House, and that \\"‚Ä¶at one time over 500 people were reading messages we had intercepted from the Japanese‚Ä¶ Everyone seemed to be reading them\\" . Fictional treatment Neal Stephenson's novel Cryptonomicon includes a fictionalized version of Magic, with the Japanese cryptosystem being named \\"Indigo\\" rather than \\"PURPLE\\". James Bond is given the products of the fictionalized \\"MAGIC 44\\" decryption programme in You Only Live Twice as a bargaining chip when he is deployed to negotiate for intelligence concessions from Tiger Tanaka, head of Japanese intelligence. The W.E.B. Griffin series The Corps is a fictionalized account of United States Navy and Marine Corps intelligence operations in the Pacific Theater during World War II. Many of the main characters in the novels, both fictional and historical, have access to and use intelligence from Magic.

Generally dated to the mid first century BC, the central theme of the work is \\"Wisdom\\" itself, appearing under two principal aspects. In its relation to man, Wisdom is the perfection of knowledge of the righteous as a gift from God showing itself in action. In direct relation to God, Wisdom is with God from all eternity. It is one of the seven Sapiential or wisdom books comprising the Septuagint, the others being Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs (Song of Solomon), Job, and Sirach. It is included in the canon of Deuterocanonical books by the Roman Catholic Church and the anagignoskomena (Gr. ·ºÄŒΩŒ±Œ≥ŒπŒ≥ŒΩœâœÉŒ∫œåŒºŒµŒΩŒ±, meaning \\"those which are to be read\\") of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Most Protestants consider it part of the Apocrypha. Structure, genre and content The structure can be divided into three sections: # Book of Eschatology #* exhortation to justice #* speech of the impious, contrasts of the wicked and the just #* exhortation to wisdom # Book of Wisdom #* Solomon's speech concerning wisdom, wealth, power and prayer # Book of History #* introduction, followed by diptychs of plagues #* digression on God's power and mercy #* digression on false worship and further plagues #* recapitulation and concluding doxology. The book is addressed to the rulers of the earth, urging them to love righteousness and seek wisdom; the wicked think that all is chance and that they should enjoy each day, but they are deluded. In the second section Solomon (not explicitly named, but strongly implied) tells of his search for wisdom. The Wisdom of Solomon can be linked to several forms of ancient literature, both Jewish and non-Jewish, but it clearly belongs with biblical Wisdom books such as the Book of Job, one of only five such books among ancient Jewish literature. In terms of classical genre it has been identified as an encomium and with the Greek genre of the \\"exhortatory discourse\\", by which a teacher attempts to persuade others to a certain course of action. Canonicity Melito of Sardis in the 2nd century AD, Augustine (c. 397 AD) and Pope Innocent I (405 AD) considered Wisdom of Solomon as part of the Old Testament. Athanasius writes that the Book of Wisdom along with three other deuterocanonical books, while not being part of the Canon, \\"were appointed by the Fathers to be read\\".Athanasius of Alexandria, Excerpt from Letter 39 Epiphanius of Salamis (c. 385 AD) mentions that the Wisdom of Solomon was of disputed canonicity. According to the monk Rufinus of Aquileia (c. 400 AD) the Book of Wisdom was not called a canonical but ecclesiastical book. The Book of Wisdom was listed as canonical by the Council of Rome (382 AD),Decretum Galasianum the Synod of Hippo (393), the Council of Carthage (397) and the Council of Carthage (419),B. F. Westcott, A General Survey of the History of the Canon of the New Testament (5th ed. Edinburgh, 1881), pp. 440, 541-2.Council of Carthage (in 419) Canon 24 the Council of Florence (in 1442)Session 11‚Äî4 February 1442 and the Council of Trent (in 1546).Session IV Celebrated on the eighth day of April, 1546 under Pope Paul III Composition The Wisdom of Solomon was written in Greek, in Alexandria (Egypt), in the late 1st century BC or early 1st century AD. The author's prime literary source was the Septuagint, in particular the Wisdom literature and the Book of Isaiah, and he was familiar with late Jewish works as the Book of Enoch and with Greek philosophical literature. It is uncertain whether the book has a single author or comes from a school of writers, but recent scholarship has favoured regarding it as a unified work. In either case its blend of Greek and Jewish features suggests a learned Hellenistic background, and despite the address to the \\"rulers of the world\\" the actual audience was probably members of the author's own community who were tempted to give up their Jewishness in the face of the temptations of Greek culture and the hostile conditions facing Jews in the Greek world. Themes The book opens with the opposed pairs righteousness/unrighteousness and death/immortality: those who do not follow righteousness will fall into \\"senseless reasoning\\" and will not be open to wisdom; wisdom is not an inherent human quality nor one that can be taught, but comes from outside, and only to those who are prepared through righteousness. The suffering of the righteous will be rewarded with immortality, while the wicked will end miserably. The unrighteous are doomed because they do not know God's purpose, but the righteous will judge the unrighteous in God's presence. Lady Wisdom dominates the next section, in which Solomon speaks. She existed from the Creation, and God is her source and guide. She is to be loved and desired, and kings seek her: Solomon himself preferred Wisdom to wealth, health, and all other things. She in turn has always come to the aid of the righteous, from Adam to the Exodus. The final section takes up the theme of the rescue of the righteous, taking the Exodus as its focus: \\"You (God) have not neglected to help (your people the Jews) at all times and in all places.\\" (Wisdom of Solomon, 19:22). Influence 19th century American author Herman Melville marked his copy of the Wisdom of Solomon heavily. Without knowledge of biblical criticism he managed to note the interplay of Hellenistic Platonism and Jewish philosophy, writing, \\"this admirable book seems partly Mosaic & partly Platonic in its tone. Who wrote it I know not. Some one to whom both Plato and Moses stood for godfather.\\" The interplay of multiple philosophies is exemplified in many of Melville's works, specifically Moby-Dick and Clarel, wherein religious and philosophical interplay represent the struggle for certainty in the 19th century.

He made his international debut in 1978 against England. During his career, he scored more than 5,000 Test runs (the first New Zealand Test player to do so) at an average of 37.82 runs per dismissal with 12 Test centuries, 10 of them in New Zealand. He also played for Derbyshire in England. In first-class cricket he scored over 25,000 runs, having scored over 50 first-class centuries. He scored over 10,000 runs in List A limited-overs cricket. Following his retirement in 1993, he coached the Indian national cricket team from 2000 to 2005 (thus became India's first foreign coach) and New Zealand from 2010 to 2012. International career He typically opened for New Zealand, and was noted as a tenacious, rather than spectacular, batsman. His team nickname was \\"shake\\"; reputedly a reflection on his packing technique. Together with Bruce Edgar of Wellington, he formed what was arguably New Zealand's most successful and reliable opening partnership. During a match against Australia in 1980, he became the second player in history to score an eight off one ball in a Test, running four and collecting four overthrows. Toward the end of his career he used an unorthodox batting stance; whereas most batsman face the bowler with the bat in line with their legs, and perpendicular to the ground, Wright would stand with his bat raised in parallel to it. In the 1988 Queen's Birthday Honours, Wright was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to cricket. Coaching career After retiring, Wright worked in sales for around two years ‚Äì self-confessedly without great success. After taking up coaching for Kent County Cricket Club, Wright enjoyed a successful coaching career with India, from 2000 to 2005, during which time the team improved immensely, winning a home test series 2‚Äì1 against Australia (which included the historic Kolkata test which India won coming back from a follow-on with Indian batsman VVS Laxman making 281*), drawing a test series against Australia in Australia 1‚Äì1 in a four-match test series in 2003‚Äì04 (Steve Waugh's farewell test series), winning a series against arch-rivals, Pakistan, and reaching the final of the 2003 Cricket World Cup held in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya. The following months saw the team lose form, and series to Australia and Pakistan. In May 2005, former Australian skipper, Greg Chappell took over from Wright. Wright was also appointed as coach of the World XI team that played Australia in the ICC Super Series 2005. An innings-by-innings breakdown of Wright's Test match batting career, showing runs scored (red bars) and the average of the last ten innings (blue line). On 20 December 2010, Wright was named as NZ Cricket Coach, replacing Mark Greatbatch. He resigned that role in 2012, following New Zealand's tour of the West Indies. In January 2013 Wright was appointed head coach of the Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League competition. The Mumbai Indians won that edition of the IPL. He was appointed as talent scout for Mumbai Indians Publications In 1990, together with New Zealand writer Paul Thomas, Wright wrote an entertaining autobiography, Christmas in Rarotonga. In 2006, Wright co-authored the book John Wright's Indian Summers describing his experiences as coach of the Indian cricket team, along with Indian journalist Sharda Ugra and Paul Thomas.

The tailcoat shares its historical origins in clothes cut for convenient horse riding in the Early Modern era. Ever since the 18th century, however, tailcoats evolved into general forms of day and evening formal wear, in parallel to how the lounge suit succeeded the frock coat (19th century) and the justacorps (18th century). Thus, in 21st-century Western dress codes for men, mainly two types of tailcoats have survived: #Dress coat, an evening wear with a squarely cut away front, worn for formal white tie #Morning coat (or cutaway in American English), a day wear with a gradually tapered front cut away, worn for formal morning dress In colloquial language without further specification, \\"tailcoat\\" typically designates the former, that is the evening (1) dress coat for white tie. History Beau Brummell wears a Regency period dress coat as daytime dress. The coat is able to close and the tails are knee length. Winfield Scott wearing a tailcoat at the Battle of Veracruz A women's black wool tailcoat, 1939 =Shadbelly= In equestrianism, a variant called a shadbelly is still worn in certain disciplines in its eighteenth-century role as daytime formalwear. It is basically a form of dress coat which is closer in cut to the early nineteenth-century style worn by Beau Brummel than to the modern version worn with evening formal dress. The male version of the shadbelly is often called a \\"weaselbelly\\". =Lev√©e dress coat= This is a type of dress coat traditionally worn with court dress, until the mid-twentieth century. It was made of black velvet and traditionally worn at court, lev√©es, and evening state parties by those who did not wear uniforms. A version made of black barathea was also worn as diplomatic dress. It was single breasted with a stand-up collar, with plain gauntlet cuffs, and two three-pointed flap pockets on the waist seam. It had six metal buttons at the front, and two decorative buttons at the back. The body of the coat was lined with black silk, and skirts with white silk. It was worn with breeches, black silk hose, white bow tie, white gloves, and court shoes (pumps) with steel buckles. The front of the coat was cut away squarely like a standard dress coat.An example of such a lev√©e coat can be seen at = Military coatee = Military issue tail coat, 1789 From c. 1790 until after the Crimean War, a red tail coat with short tails, known as a coatee, was part of the infantry uniform of the British army. The collar and cuffs were in the regimental colors and the coats had white braid on the front. Elite light infantry units like the 95th Rifles were issued short green coats to provide camouflage and ease of movement. The Americans issued a similar uniform in dark blue to enlisted men during the War of 1812. This remained in service until 1833 when it was replaced with a shell jacket. Officers continued to wear tail coats until after the Mexican War when frock coats became the standard field wear. By the time the M1858 uniform was introduced tail coats had been relegated to full dress. The Royal Navy had an elaborate hierarchy of tailcoats for the officers, allowing further buttons and gilding according to rank and seniority. These were single-breasted for junior officers and double-breasted for those with the rank of lieutenant and above. =Highland coatee= This is worn with Highland dress, and has a square cut away front like a dress coat, but the tails are cut significantly shorter. =Footman's coat= This was worn as livery, a servant's uniform. It was knee length with a sloped cut-away front like a morning coat. It was single breasted with a stand-up collar and gilt buttons. There were three pronged side pockets similar in style to the lev√©e dress coat. Dress coat Caricature of Mr John Delacour (19th century) wearing dress coat with top hat for white tie. A dress coat, sometimes called a swallow-tail or claw-hammer coat, is the coat that has, since the 1850s, come to be worn only in the evening by men as part of the white tie dress code, also known as evening full dress, for formal evening occasions. It is commonly referred to as just a tailcoat, but amongst tailors (both British and American) and dress historians it is traditionally called a dress coat to differentiate it from other types of tailcoats. The modern dress coat is an evolution of the coat that was once both day and evening dress. It became increasingly popular from around the late 1790s and was particularly widespread during the British Regency, and in America in the 1830s to 1850s. The eighteenth-century dress coat was supplanted in the 1850s as formal day wear by the frock coat, which was in turn replaced in the twentieth century by the morning coat. In the Regency period, the dress coat with gilt buttons was always worn with non-matching trousers, pantaloons or breeches. Since the Victorian era, the modern dress coat for evening wear has been worn with matching trousers of the same cloth with two stripes of braiding down the side. The resulting suit is traditionally referred to by tailors as a dress suit. A dress coat is waist length in the front and sides, and has two long tails reaching to the knees in back. Sometimes there is a pocket on the inside to hold gloves. Since around the 1840s the dress coat has lacked outside side pockets, but prior to this it took flapped side pockets. Since the early twentieth century, it has become acceptable to have a welted pocket on the outside of the chest to hold a pocket square, but prior to this dress coats lacked any outer pockets. The front of the skirt is squarely cut away. Since around the 1830s the coat has been constructed with a waist seam that allows greater waist suppression. From the Victorian era, the revers has taken facings in silk (grosgrain or satin) on the lapels. Although it is double-breasted, since the 1870s, the dress coat no longer fastens in the front. As a result, although there are two rows of buttons, these are all non-functional, serving only a decorative function. As part of modern white tie, either a black dress coat is worn with a stiff detachable white wing-collar dress shirt, with a plain starched pique bib, and single cuffs fastened with cufflinks; a matching white marcella cotton bowtie and white waistcoat; black trousers; and black patent leather pumps with stockings. Additionally, a top hat, silk dress scarf, and white dress gloves are also seen as acceptable. Morning coat Two men wearing morning coats at a wedding. 1929. A morning coat is a single-breasted coat, with the front parts usually meeting at one button in the middle, and curving away gradually into a pair of tails behind, topped by two ornamental buttons on the waist seam. The lapels are usually pointed (American English peak), not step (notch), since the coat is now only worn as formalwear. When it was first introduced, the step lapel was common, since it was worn as half dress. The coat can be grey or black as part of morning dress, and is usually worn with striped, or very occasionally checked, trousers. The morning coat may also be worn as part of a morning suit, which is mid-grey with matching trousers and waistcoat. The modern morning coat (or cutaway in American English) is a man's coat worn as the principal item in morning dress. The name derives from morning nineteenth-century horseback riding exercise for gentlemen. It was regarded as an informal form of half dress. Gradually it became acceptable as an alternative to the frock coat for formal day wear or full dress. Since the nineteenth century it is normally only seen at weddings, at formal A modern traditional morning tailcoat, made of Mohair. baptisms, and in England and Australia, at races such as Royal Ascot, the Derby and the Victoria Derby where it is worn with a contrasting waistcoat, usually light grey or sometimes 'fancy'. It is very occasionally seen at funerals but more often it is used as day wear at formal luncheons, especially civic occasions under formal gowns, when worn with a black matching waistcoat (or 'vest'). Male members of the cabinet of Japan wear it in their first public appearance following the formation of the cabinet. The Marshal and Clerk of the United States Supreme Court wear morning coats when the justices are appearing in public wearing their traditional robes, for example when the court is in session, or when attending the President's State of the Union address. At one time all attorneys appearing before the court wore morning coats but they now wear standard business attire. The United States Solicitor General (when the office is held by a male) and his or her male deputies continue the tradition of wearing morning dress when arguing before the court. During the Victorian and Edwardian era, in the United States morning coat referred to a single-breasted frock coat, so the British then made fun of the fact that Americans were unable to distinguish between morning coats and frock coats. In modern American English, morning coats are referred to as cutaway coats.

The terms \\"indie publisher\\" and \\"independent press\\" or \\"self publishing\\" and others are sometimes used interchangeably. Independent press is generally defined as publishers that are not part of large conglomerates or multinational corporations. Many small presses rely on specialization in genre fiction, poetry, or limited-edition books or magazines, but there are also thousands that focus on niche non- fiction markets. Definitions In the United States, this has been mentioned as publishers with annual turnover of under $50 million, or those that publish on average 10 or fewer titles per year. Other terms for small press, sometimes distinguished from each other and sometimes used interchangeably, are small publishers, independent publishers, or indie presses. Independent publishers (as defined above) made up about half of the market share of the book publishing industry in the US in 2007.Herman, Jeff Herman's Guide To Book Publishers, Editors & Literary Agents, 2007, p. 131. The majority of small presses are independent or indie publishers, meaning that they are separate from the handful of major publishing house conglomerates, such as Random House or Hachette. =Characteristics= Since the profit margins for small presses can be narrow, many are driven by other motives, including the desire to help disseminate literature with only a small likely market. Many presses are also associated with crowdfunding efforts that help connect authors with readers.https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/05/the-literary- crowdfunding-boom/ Small presses tend to fill the niches that larger publishers neglect. They can focus on regional titles, narrow specializations and niche genres. They can also make up for commercial clout by creating a reputation for academic knowledge, vigorously pursuing prestigious literature prizes and spending more effort nurturing the careers of new authors.Herman, Jeff Herman's Guide To Book Publishers, Editors & Literary Agents, 2007, pp. 131‚Äì132, 367‚Äì372. At its most minimal, small press production consists of chapbooks. This role can now be taken on by desktop publishing and Web sites. This still leaves a continuum of small press publishing: from specialist periodicals, short runs or print-to-order of low-demand books, to fine art books and limited editions of collectors' items printed to high standards. =Micro-presses= There is now also a distinction made between small presses and micro-presses. A micro-press can be defined as a publisher that produces chapbooks and other small books on a very small scale (e.g. 50 copies of one book per year). It can also be defined in terms of revenue. Micro-presses often are run as a hobby or part-time job because of their low profits. They may not produce enough profit to support their owners. In Canada, these are considered small press publishers but the standard small press book run is accepted at 300 copies of a chapbook and 500 or more copies of a spine-bound book. In doing this, small press publishers are eligible for grants from the Ontario Arts Council and the Canada Council. =Not to be confused with= Small presses should not be confused with self-publishing presses (sometimes called \\"vanity presses\\"). Self-publishing or subsidy presses usually require payment by authors, or a minimum purchase of copies. By comparison, small presses make their profits by selling books to consumers, rather than selling services to authors or selling a small number of copies to the author's friends. Small presses should not be confused with printers. Small presses are publishers, which means that they engage in a book selection process, along with editing, marketing and distribution. Small presses also enter into a contract with the author, often paying royalties for being allowed to sell the book. Publishers own the copies they have printed, but usually do not own the copyright to the book itself. In contrast, printers merely print a book, and sometimes offer limited distribution if they are a POD printing press. Printers have a very low selectivity. They will accept nearly anyone who can pay the cost of printing. They rarely offer editing or marketing. Printers do not own the copies that are printed, and they do not pay royalties. Book packagers combine aspects of small presses and printers, but they are technically neither small presses nor printers. History Small presses became distinguishable from jobbing printers at some time towards the end of the nineteenth century. The roots lie with the Arts and Crafts Movement, particularly the Kelmscott Press. The use of small letterpress machines by amateur printers increased proportionately to the mechanization of commercial printing. Later, the advance of practical lithography made small press publication much easier. A recent burgeoning of small presses has been caused by the introduction of digital printing, especially print on demand technology. Combined with Internet based marketing, digital typesetting, design tools with the rise of eBooks, the new printing technologies have lowered the economic barriers to entry, allowing many new niches to be served, and many new publishers to enter the industry. By country =Australia= Small presses have played a significant part historically in recognising new voices and publishing notable works of literary fiction in Australia, but the market was seen as a tough one in 1999, despite about 80 per cent of the Australian Publishers Association being small book publishers (defined as those with less than AU$2m), nearly all Australian-owned. In recent years though, the small publishers have especially made gains as big publishers have backed away from publishing literary works. In recent years small press publications have won some of the greatest literary prizes, including the Stella Prize, the Prime Minister's Literary Award for Fiction and the Miles Franklin Literary Award. There was a strong upward trend in the number of titles published by small press and shortlisted for the Miles Franklin and the PM's Fiction Awards in the two years preceding 2017. The Small Press Network (SPN), located at the Wheeler Centre in Melbourne, represents small and independent publishers in Australia, which promotes independent publishing and supports diversity within the industry \\"as a vital component of Australian literary culture\\". Founded in 2006, it has grown to represent more than 140 members in Australia and New Zealand. Its members include such publishers as the Griffith Review, National Library of Australia Publishing, Scribe and Wakefield Press, as well as many smaller publishers.

The latest iteration is GameMaker Studio 2, first released in 2017. GameMaker accommodates the creation of cross-platform and multi-genre video games using a custom drag-and-drop visual programming language or a scripting language known as Game Maker Language, which can be used to develop more advanced games that could not be created just by using the drag and drop features. GameMaker was originally designed to allow novice computer programmers to be able to make computer games without much programming knowledge by use of these actions. Recent versions of software also focus on appealing to advanced developers.  Overview  GameMaker is primarily intended for making games with 2D graphics, allowing out-of-box use of raster graphics, vector graphics (via SWF), and 2D skeletal animations (via Esoteric Software's Spine) along with a large standard library for drawing graphics and 2D primitives. While the software allows for limited use of 3D graphics, this is in form of vertex buffer and matrix functions, and as such not intended for novice users. The engine uses Direct3D on Windows, UWP, and Xbox One; OpenGL on macOS and Linux; OpenGL ES on Android and iOS, WebGL or 2d canvas on HTML5, and proprietary APIs on consoles. The engine's primary element is an IDE with built-in editors for raster graphics, level design, scripting, paths, and shaders (GLSL or HLSL). Additional functionality can be implemented in software's scripting language or platform-specific native extensions. In GameMaker Studio 2, you can choose whether to export the game as an NSIS installer, or a .zip file containing the game, the data.win file, and any files added under the \\"Included Files\\" tab in the editor. = Supported platforms = GameMaker supports building for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, HTML5, Android, iOS, Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, Microsoft UWP, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One; support for the Nintendo Switch was announced in March 2018, with Undertale to be the first such title to be brought to the Switch. In past, GameMaker supported building for Windows Phone (deprecated in favor of UWP), Tizen, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation Vita (not supported in GMS2 \\"largely for business reasons\\"). PlayStation Portable support was demonstrated in May 2010, but never made publicly available (with only a small selection of titles using it). Raspberry Pi support was demonstrated in February 2016, but as of May 2018 not released. Between 2007 and 2011, YoYo Games maintained a custom web player plugin for GameMaker games before releasing it as open-source mid-2011 and finally deprecating in favor of HTML5 export. = Drag and Drop = Drag and Drop (DnD) is GameMaker's visual scripting tool. DnD allows developers to perform common tasks (like instantiating objects, calling functions, or working with files and data structures) without having to write a single line of code. It remains to be largely aimed at novice users. While historically DnD remained fairly limited in what can be comfortably done with it, GameMaker Studio 2 had seen an overhaul to the system, allowing more tasks to be done with DnD, and having it translate directly to code (with an in-IDE preview for users interested in migrating to code).  GameMaker Language  GameMaker Language is GameMaker's scripting language. It is an imperative, dynamically typed language commonly likened to JavaScript and C-like languages. The language's default mode of operation on native platforms is via a stack machine; it can also be source- to-source compiled to C++ via LLVM for higher performance. On HTML5, GML is source-to-source compiled to JavaScript with optimizations and minification applied in non-debug builds.  History  GameMaker was originally developed by Mark Overmars. The program was first released on 15 November 1999 under the name of Animo (at the time, it was just a graphics tool with limited visual scripting capabilities). The first versions of the program were being developed in Delphi. Subsequent releases saw the name changed to Game Maker and software moving towards more general-purpose 2D game development. Versions 5.0 and below have been freeware; version 5.1 introduced an optional registration fee; version 5.3 (January 2004) introduced a number of new features for registered users, including particle systems, networking, and possibility to extend games using DLLs. Version 6.0 (October 2004) introduced limited functionality for use of 3D graphics, as well as migrating the runtime's drawing pipeline from VCL to DirectX. Growing public interest led Overmars to seek help in expanding the program, which led to partnership with YoYo Games in 2007. From this point onward, development was handled by YoYo Games while Overmars retained a position as one of company's directors. Version 7.0 was the first to emerge under this partnership. The first macOS compatible version of program was released in 2009, allowing games to be made for two operating systems with minimal changes. Version 8.1 (April 2011) sees the name changed to GameMaker (lacking a space) to avoid any confusion with the 1991 software Game-Maker. This version also had the runtime rewritten in C++ to address performance concerns with previous versions. September 2011 sees the initial release of \\"GameMaker: HTML5\\" - a new version of software with capability to export games for web browsers along with desktop. GameMaker: Studio entered public beta in March 2012 and enjoyed a full release in May 2012. Initial supported platforms included Windows, Mac, HTML5, Android, and iOS. Additional platforms and features were introduced over the years following; Late 2012 there was an accident with anti-piracy measures misfiring for some legitimate users. In February 2015, GameMaker was acquired by Playtech together with YoYo Games. Announcement reassured that GameMaker will be further improved and states plans to appeal to broader demographic, including more advanced developers. November 2016 saw the initial release of GameMaker Studio 2 beta, with full release in March 2017. This version spots a completely redesigned IDE (rewritten in C#) and a number of new editor and runtime features.  Digital rights management  In early 2013, a version of GameMaker: Studio was that would import games and destroy all image resources for some customers of the software by superimposing a pirate symbol on top of the image. This was due to a fault in its digital rights management implementation that was used to combat infringing copies of the software. YoYo Games publicly stated they would remove the DRM at a later point in time, but that other less-invasive DRM techniques would remain.  Reception  The program currently holds a rating of 8.5/10 on Mod DB based on 223 user reviews; many cite its flexibility and ease of use as positives and instability, crashes, project corruption and outdated features as negatives. Douglas Clements of Indie Game Magazine wrote that the program \\"[s]implifies and streamlines game development\\" and is \\"easy for beginners yet powerful enough to grow as you develop\\", though noting that \\"resource objects have to be gathered if unable to create\\" and that licensing between Steam and the YoYo Games website is \\"convoluted\\".

The significance of the dream has been debated, but most interpretations agree that it identified Jacob with the obligations and inheritance of the people chosen by God, as understood in Abrahamic religions. Jacob's Ladder as depicted in Monheim Town Hall. The gilded Hebrew text reads \\"And, behold, the LORD stood beside him, and said: 'And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee whithersoever thou goest Jacob exclaims, \\"How full of awe is this place!\\" Biblical narrative The description of Jacob's ladder appears in : Afterwards, Jacob names the place \\"Bethel\\" (literally, \\"House of God\\"). Judaism Jacob's Dream (1639) by Jos√© de Ribera, at the Museo del Prado, Madrid The classic Torah commentaries offer several interpretations of Jacob's ladder. According to the Midrash Genesis Rabbah, the ladder signified the exiles which the Jewish people would suffer before the coming of the Jewish messiah. First the angel representing the 70-year exile of Babylonia climbed \\"up\\" 70 rungs, and then fell \\"down\\". Then the angel representing the exile of Persia went up a number of steps, and fell, as did the angel representing the exile of Greece. Only the fourth angel, which represented the final exile of Rome/Edom (whose guardian angel was Esau himself), kept climbing higher and higher into the clouds. Jacob feared that his children would never be free of Esau's domination, but God assured him that at the End of Days, Edom too would come falling down. Another interpretation of the ladder keys into the fact that the angels first \\"ascended\\" and then \\"descended\\". The Midrash explains that Jacob, as a holy man, was always accompanied by angels. When he reached the border of the land of Canaan (the future land of Israel), the angels who were assigned to the Holy Land went back up to Heaven and the angels assigned to other lands came down to meet Jacob. When Jacob returned to Canaan he was greeted by the angels who were assigned to the Holy Land. Yet another interpretation is this: The place at which Jacob stopped for the night was in reality Mount Moriah, the future home of the Temple in Jerusalem. The ladder therefore signifies the \\"bridge\\" between Heaven and earth, as prayers and sacrifices offered in the Holy Temple soldered a connection between God and the Jewish people. Moreover, the ladder alludes to the giving of the Torah as another connection between heaven and earth. In this interpretation, it is also significant that the Hebrew word for ladder, sulam (◊°◊ú◊ù) and the name for the mountain on which the Torah was given, Sinai (◊°◊ô◊†◊ô) have the same gematria (numerical value of the letters). The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher Philo, born in Alexandria, (d. ca. 50 CE) presents his allegorical interpretation of the ladder in the first book of his De somniis. There he gives four interpretations, which are not mutually exclusive: * The angels represent souls descending to and ascending from bodies (some consider this to be Philo's clearest reference to the doctrine of reincarnation). * In the second interpretation the ladder is the human soul and the angels are God's logoi, pulling the soul up in distress and descending in compassion. * In the third view the dream depicts the ups and downs of the life of the \\"practiser\\" (of virtue vs. sin). * Finally the angels represent the continually changing affairs of men. A hilltop overlooking the Israeli settlement of Beit El north of Jerusalem that is believed by some to be the site of Jacob's dream is a tourist destination during the holiday of Sukkot. Christianity Jacob's Dream by William Blake (c. 1805, British Museum, London) Jesus said in John 1:51 \\"And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.\\" This statement has been interpreted as associating or implicating Jesus with the mythical ladder, in that Christ bridges the gap between Heaven and Earth. Jesus presents himself as the reality to which the ladder points; as Jacob saw in a dream the reunion of Heaven and Earth, Jesus brought this reunion, metaphorically the ladder, into reality. Adam Clarke, an early 19th-century Methodist theologian and Bible scholar, elaborates: The theme of a ladder to heaven is often used by the Church Fathers. Irenaeus in the second century describes the Christian Church as the \\"ladder of ascent to God\\".Irenaeus, Adversus haereses, III,24,1 In the third century, OrigenOrigen, Homily n. 27 on Numbers, about Nm 33:1‚Äì2 explains that there are two ladders in the life of a Christian, the ascetic ladder that the soul climbs on the earth, by way of‚Äîand resulting in‚Äîan increase in virtue, and the soul's travel after death, climbing up the heavens towards the light of God. In the fourth century, Gregory of NazianzusGregory of Nazianzus, Homily n. 43 (Funeral Oration on the Great S. Basil), 71 speaks of ascending Jacob's Ladder by successive steps towards excellence, interpreting the ladder as an ascetic path, while Saint Gregory of Nyssa narratesGregory of Nyssa, Life of Moses, pp. 224‚Äì227 that Moses climbed on Jacob's Ladder to reach the heavens where he entered the tabernacle not made with hands, thus giving the Ladder a clear mystical meaning. The ascetic interpretation is found also in Saint John Chrysostom, who writes: Jacob's Ladder as an analogy for the spiritual ascetic of life enjoyed wide influence thanks to the classical work The Ladder of Divine Ascent by John Climacus. File:JacobsLaddertoHeaven.jpgJacob's Ladder, c. 1925, European Christian illustration File:ACU_Jacobs_Dream_artwork.JPGJacob's Dream artwork on the campus of Abilene Christian University  Islam  In Islam, Jacob () is revered as a prophet and patriarch. Muslim scholars drew a parallel between Jacob's vision of the ladder and Muhammad's event of the Mi'raj. The ladder of Jacob was interpreted to be one of the many symbols of God, and many see Jacob's ladder as representing in its form the essence of Islam, which emphasizes following the \\"straight path\\". The twentieth-century scholar Martin Lings described the significance of the ladder in the Islamic mystic perspective: > The ladder of the created Universe is the ladder which appeared in a dream > to Jacob, who saw it stretching from Heaven to earth, with Angels going up > and down upon it; and it is also the \\"straight path\\", for indeed the way of > religion is none other than the way of creation itself retraced from its end > back to its Beginning. Pseudepigraphic apocalyptic literature The narrative of Jacob's Ladder was used, shortly after the destruction of the Second Temple in the Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE), as basis for the pseudepigraphic Ladder of Jacob. This writing, preserved only in Old Church Slavonic, interprets the experience of Patriarchs in the context of Merkabah mysticism.  Cultural references  The angels climb Jacob's Ladder on the west front of Bath Abbey. Jacob's Ladder has been depicted in many artworks, the largest of which is the facade of Bath Abbey in England where sculptures depict angels climbing up and down ladders on either side of the main window on the west front.

The segments were produced by the CBS Television Network and broadcast nightly from July 4, 1974, until December 31, 1976. (The series was originally slated to end on July 4, 1976, airing a total of 732 episodes, but was extended to the end of the year.) The segments were sponsored by Shell Oil Company, then later by Raid (insecticide) from July 1976 onward. Description The series was created by Ethel Winant and Lewis Freedman of CBS, who had overcome the objections of network executives who considered it to be an unworthy use of program time. The producer of the series was Paul Waigner, the executive producer was Bob Markell, and the executive story editor and writer was Bernard Eismann from 1974 to 1976. He was followed by Jerome Alden. Associate producer Meryle Evans researched the historical facts for the broadcasts. In 1976, the series received an Emmy Award in the category of Special Classification of Outstanding Program and Individual Achievement. It also won a Special Christopher Award in 1976. The videotaped segments were each one minute long and were broadcast each night during prime time hours, generally at approximately 8:27 or 8:57 P.M. Eastern time. The format of the segments did not change, although each segment featured a different narrator, often a CBS network television star. The narrator, after introducing himself or herself, would state \\"This is a Bicentennial Minute,\\" followed by the phrase \\"Two hundred years ago today...\\" and a description of a historical event or personage prominent on that particular date two hundred years before during the American Revolution. The segment would close with the narrator saying, \\"I'm (his/her name), and that's the way it was.\\" This was an offhand reference to the close of the weeknight CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite, who always ended each news telecast by saying, \\"And that's the way it is.\\" The Bicentennial Minute on July 3, 1976, was narrated by Vice President Nelson Rockefeller. The Bicentennial Minute on July 4, 1976, was narrated by First Lady Betty Ford. The final Bicentennial Minute, broadcast on December 31, 1976, was narrated by President Gerald Ford. (This was also the longest Bicentennial minute.) After the series ended, the time slot of the Bicentennial Minute came to be occupied by a brief synopsis of news headlines (\\"Newsbreak\\") read by a CBS anchor. In popular culture The Bicentennial Minute achieved a high cultural profile during its run and was widely referenced and parodied. For example, in the All in the Family episode \\"Mike's Move\\" (originally broadcast on February 2, 1976), the character Mike Stivic responded to a typical monologue by his father-in-law Archie Bunker about the history of American immigration and the meaning of the Statue of Liberty with the sarcastic comment: \\"I think we just heard Archie Bunker's Bicentennial Minute.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fATKiS-mU8Y Another Norman Lear- produced sitcom, Sanford and Son, featured series star Redd Foxx parodying the Bicentennial Minute. Country music also used the Bicentennial Minute as a source of humor. The long-running television program Hee Haw parodied Bicentennial Minutes as \\"About 200 Years Ago\\", with musician Grandpa Jones (wearing a mockery of a tri-cornered hat) giving a weekly monologue of humorously fractured historical \\"facts\\", about figures from the American Revolution and the colonial era. These ended with Jones saying \\"That's the way it was, about 200 years ago... enh, more or less,\\" and shrugging at the camera. The radio program American Country Countdown had a similar feature, delivered by then-ACC host Don Bowman. A sketch on The Sonny and Cher Show aired in early 1976 featured guest star Jim Nabors portraying British King George III, offering a comic rebuttal to the always pro-American Revolution Bicentennial Minutes. The Carol Burnett Show with Harvey Korman and Tim Conway did a comic parody.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_ffW8VCbbA The character Brenda Morgenstern (Julie Kavner) refers to the Bicentennial Minutes in the Rhoda episode \\"If You Don't Tell Her, I Will,\\" broadcast in December 1975.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8nfpGqBeyg CBS daytime game show Match Game had questions posed to contestants in this form as well throughout 1975 and 1976. Panelist Charles Nelson Reilly makes a joke that a moment on the New Year's Eve 1976 episode of Match Game 76 is \\"the last one, thank god.\\" In an episode of The King of Queens, Arthur briefly references the Bicentennial Minute by saying how in 1976 he remembers \\"throwing a pair of glasses at the TV during a particularly offensive Bicentennial Minute!\\" In the February 24, 1975 episode of Maude \\"Walter's Pride\\", when Walter gives Maude a list of reasons for why she cannot mortgage the house to save his business, Maude responds \\"...I didn't ask for your Bicentennial Minute!\\" On the April 24, 1976 episode of the NBC show Saturday Night Live, host Raquel Welch appears in a sketch entitled Bisexual Minutes. Wearing a bicentennial themed bikini she announces, \\"Good evening. I'm Gore Vidal.\\" Ms. Welch had previously appeared in the film Myra Breckinridge which was based on the novel of the same name by Mr. Vidal, a noted bisexual.

It is approximately north of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. The Souris River runs by the city. This city is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Estevan No. 5. History The first settlers in what was to become Estevan arrived in 1892, along with the expansion of the Canadian Pacific Railway. It was incorporated as a village in 1899, and later became a town in 1906. On March 1, 1957, Estevan acquired the status of a city, which, in Saskatchewan terms, is any community of 5,000 or more. arriving into the City from Highway 47N The name origin is attributed to George Stephen's registered telegraphic address, Estevan. George Stephen was the first President of the Canadian Pacific Railway from 1881 to 1888. World War I Military unit On December 22, 1915, the 152nd (Weyburn-Estevan) Battalion, CEF was authorised and recruited men from the area before departing to Great Britain on October 3, 1916. 1931 Riot Estevan was the site of the notorious Estevan Riot in 1931. Although most of the strikers were from nearby Bienfait, the strike is associated with Estevan because it was in this city the demonstrators were met by members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. After the subsequent riot, which lasted 45 minutes, three strikers lay dead. It was later proven the three miners had been killed by the RCMP.

The most recurrent sacrifices consist in samples of cr√©me de cac√°o, jewels, specially golden rings and Agua de Florida. For her birthday a wild pig is normally the main sacrifice. Ezili Dantor and the Haitian Revolution Black Madonna of Czƒôstochowa It is accounted that the slave revolt of 1791, started with a pact which followed a big feast in honour to Ezili Dantor. For this reason she is considered the national lwa. Considered to be the lwa of vengeance and rage, made it to be popular among single mothers during the 1980s and 1990s in Haiti and Dominican Republic. The syncretic modern representation of this lwa is commonly associated to the Black Madonna of Czƒôstochowa, the patron saint of Poland. The original association of Ezili Dantor with this catholic icon is hypothesised to be from copies of the icon brought to Haiti by Polish soldiers sent by order of Napoleon Bonaparte, to subdue the then still ongoing Haitian Revolution. It is accounted that the Polish legion decreased significantly in numbers in contrast with the insurrected slaves, forcing the remaining captive soldiers to switch band to the side of the slaves. As a consequence of this action, during Jean-Jacques Dessalines's 1804 massacre, which took place short after the Haitian victory; the Poles were left alive and granted citizenship for the newly founded Republic of Haiti. The descendants of these soldiers are still living in the island, specifically in the locality of Cazale.\\"Re Polish presence in Haiti : Judson comments\\" ‚ÄîDiscussion on webster.edu. A generalised misconception about Ezil√≠ Dantor is to associate the lwa with motherhood, mostly in Louisiana's voodoo and other American modern assimilations of voodoo. Mostly because of its association with a portrait of Mother Mary with child Jesus. The accurate modern reading from Haitian accounts by voodoo priests and worshippers from the island, is to associate the pink dressed child Jesus with Ezil√≠ Freda, the younger sibling of Ezil√≠ Dantor, who is also responsible of leaving 2 scars on Dantor's cheek during a fight over the love of Ogun, according to the legend.Llerena Cano, Guillermo.

He was one of the most important composers of the 17th century, a friend of Dieterich Buxtehude and a major influence on Johann Sebastian Bach; however, very few of his works survive to this day. Life Johann Adam Reincken. The widespread claims about Reincken's exceptional longevity stem from Johann Mattheson, who, writing in 1722, gave his date of birth as 27 April 1623. However, Reincken himself stated (on the title page of Hortus musicus) that his birthplace was Deventer, and no records were found there to support Mattheson's claim. A \\"Jan Reinse\\" was baptized in Deventer on 10 December 1643; this is the date currently accepted by most scholars, although it is in many ways as problematic as that given by Mattheson. Reincken received primary music education in Deventer in 1650‚Äì1654, from Lucas van Lennick, organist of the Grote kerk (Lebuinuskerk). In 1654 he departed for Hamburg to study under Heinrich Scheidemann, a pupil of Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, organist of St. Katharine's Church (Katharinenkirche). In 1657 he returned to Deventer and became organist of the Bergkerk on 11 March; however, after only a year he left for Hamburg again, this time to become Scheidemann's assistant. When the older composer died in 1663, Reincken succeeded him at St. Katharine's. In 1665 he married one of Scheidemann's daughters, and their only child Margaretha-Maria was born three years later. The composer kept his position at St. Katharine's until his death in 1722, although in 1705 some of the church elders attempted to appoint Johann Mattheson as Reincken's successor. Unlike many other contemporary organists, Reincken died wealthy. In his lifetime he was heralded as one of the best organists in Germany; he knew Dieterich Buxtehude closely and influenced Vincent L√ºbeck and Johann Sebastian Bach. The latter may have met him; a well-known apocryphal anecdote describes how Reincken and Bach met, and how, after Bach improvised a lengthy fantasia on the Lutheran chorale \\"An Wasserfl√ºssen Babylon\\" (paying homage to Reincken's massive fantasia on the same chorale), Reincken remarked: \\"I thought that this art was dead, but I see that it lives in you.\\"Sojourn: Jan Adams Reincken , by Timothy A. Smith Christoph Wolff adds as a further detail of this visit by Bach to Hamburg in 1720, that on that occasion he performed the organ fugue BWV 542, the theme of which is based on a Dutch popular tune (called 'Ik ben gegroet van...'), presumably as an homage to Reincken's Dutch origin. At any rate, Bach was evidently deeply impressed by Reincken's music, arranging several of the works from Hortus musicus (as BWV 954, 965 and 966). In 2006, the earliest known Bach autograph was discovered in Weimar: a copy of Reincken's An Wasserfl√ºssen Babylon, which Bach made for his then teacher Georg B√∂hm in L√ºneburg in 1700.

The entire population of the census subdivision Baffin, Unorganized, is located here. (Baffin Region is the Statistics Canada name for Qikiqtaaluk.) As of the 2016 census, the population was reported as 62, an increase of 57 over the 2011 census. It takes its name from , which wintered east of the present station, off what is now Cape Sheridan, in 1875‚Äì1876. Alert has many temporary inhabitants, as it hosts a military signals intelligence radio receiving facility at Canadian Forces Station Alert (CFS Alert), as well as a co-located Environment Canada weather station, a Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) atmosphere monitoring observatory, and the Alert Airport. History Alert is named after , a British ship that wintered about away in 1875‚Äì76.A History of the Canadian Coast Guard and Marine Services The ship's captain, George Nares, and his crew were the first recorded Europeans to reach the northern end of Ellesmere Island. Over the following decades, several other expeditions passed through the area, most notably Robert Peary during his expedition to reach the north pole in 1909. =Post-World War II (1945‚Äì1970)= Shortly after the end of World War II, Charles J. Hubbard of the United States Weather Bureau began to rouse interest in the United States and Canada for the establishment of a network of Arctic stations. His plan, in broad perspective, envisaged the establishment of two main stations, one in Greenland and the other within the Archipelago, which could be reached by sea supply. These main stations would then serve as advance bases from which a number of smaller stations would be established by air. The immediate plans contemplated the establishment of weather stations only, but it was felt that a system of weather stations would also provide a nucleus of transportation, communications and settlements, which would greatly aid programs of research in many other fields of science. It was recognized that ultimate action would depend on international co-operation, since the land masses involved were under Canadian and Danish control. A sign at CFS Alert commemorating Alert as the northernmost permanently inhabited settlement in the world. The area has been inhabited since 1950. Following negotiations between the American and Canadian governments, a group of five weather stations were established, known as the Joint Arctic Weather Stations (JAWS). On the Canadian side, the stations were to be operated by the Department of Transport. The locations for each station were surveyed in 1946, and a cache of supplies was dropped in Alert in 1948 by USS Edisto. Alert was the last of the five to be settled when the first twelve personnel (eight permanent staff and four to assist with construction) arrived on April 9, 1950. Construction began immediately, with the first priority being the creation of an ice runway on Alert Inlet before work began on the permanent all-season runway located on Cape Belknap. Until its completion, supplies were parachuted in. On July 30, 1950, nine crew members of a Royal Canadian Air Force Lancaster died in a crash while making an airdrop of supplies to the station. The last American personnel were withdrawn on October 31, 1970, and the following year operation of the weather station was transferred to the newly created Department of the Environment, with the Department of Transport retaining control of airfield operations for several more years. In April 1971, a party of federal and Northwest Territories (NWT) government officials arrived in Alert in an attempt to reach the North Pole. Alert had been the embarkation point for many North Pole expeditions that relied on weather information supplied by the weather station there. The 1971 expedition was led by NWT Commissioner, Stuart Hodgson, and included in his party were representatives of the Prime Minister's office, the Canadian Armed Forces, the federal Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, as well as a large media group including Pat Carney of Gemini Productions, Ed Ogle of Time magazine, Val Wake of CBC News and a television crew from California. While waiting in Alert for a weather window to fly into the Pole, the party's television crew spent a lot of time filming at the weather station. The military was unhappy about the film crew working on the station, but the weather station was seen as being a sort of no-man's land. The Commissioner's party made two attempts to reach the Pole and failed. Some of the incidents surrounding this event are recounted in Val Wake's memoir My Voyage around Spray with Apologies to Captain Joshua Slocum.My Voyage Around Spray Val Wake website =Recent history (1971‚Äìpresent)= Alert Background Air Pollution Monitoring Network in 1986. In August 1975, Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau and his then 3-year-old son and future prime minister, Justin Trudeau visited the station and nearby Ward Hunt Island. In August 1986, the Government of Canada opened Alert Background Air Pollution Monitoring Network in Alert. By the 1990s, the remaining buildings for the original weather station had fallen into a state of disrepair and were burned in the summer of 1996, leaving only the hydrogen shed and a wooden outhouse. The weather station and observatory offices were moved to Polaris Hall. In early April 2006, the Roly McLenahan Torch that was used to light the flame at Whitehorse, Yukon, for the Canada Winter Games passed through Alert. While the Canada Games torch was supposed to pass over the North Pole, bad weather prevented a Canadian military Twin Otter from making the trip. The torch did not travel outside Alert that weekend (April 9‚Äì12). In August 2006, then-Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, made a visit to Alert as part of his campaign to promote Canadian sovereignty in the north. On November 8, 2009, the 2010 Winter Olympics torch relay arrived at Alert via airplane from Churchill, Manitoba, reaching its most northerly point on land. The next day it travelled to Iqaluit. On January 19 and 20, 2015, Governor General David Johnston flew into Alert on a C-17 Globemaster transport from CFB Trenton. He toured Alert, received an overview of its operations, met with civilian and military personnel and presided over a change-of-command. =Aircraft crashes= Since Alert has not been regularly accessible by icebreakers due to heavy ice conditions in the Lincoln Sea, resupply is provided by Royal Canadian Air Force transport aircraft which land at the adjacent Alert Airport. Difficult conditions at such a remote northern location have resulted in several incidents, two of which have involved fatalities: The remains of the Royal Canadian Air Force Lancaster 965, which crashed in July 1950. Difficult Arctic conditions makes landings in Alert hazardous. * On July 31, 1950, around 1700 hours GMT, an RCAF Lancaster 965 from 405 Squadron Greenwood crashed during the establishment of the JAWS weather station when the parachute for resupplies being airdropped became entangled on the tail of the aircraft. The nine crew members were killed. An attempt was made to recover their bodies; an RCAF Canso flying boat was dispatched and landed in Dumbell Bay on August 7. The bodies of the Canadian crew were brought aboard in wooden coffins made from packing crates‚Äîthe family of Colonel C.J. Hubbard of the United States Weather Bureau requested his remains be buried at Alert‚Äîbut the combination of the extra weight and a tail wind resulted in an aborted takeoff. The Canso struck ground at the narrow point of Dumbell Bay, damaging the tail section and rendering it useless. Following this, it was decided to bury the crew's remains west of the airstrip, and a military funeral was held the same day. The arrival of the United States Coast Guard icebreaker allowed repairs to be made to the Canso. The wreckage of the Lancaster is still visible southwest of the CE building. * On October 11, 1952, an American Military Air Transport Service Douglas C-54 Skymaster crashed on landing at Alert, while carrying a load of aviation fuel. The four crew members survived the crash; however, the aircraft was destroyed. The wreckage was pushed to the south side of the runway, where it remains today. Because of the high visibility of the wreckage due to its location at the runway, it is often mistaken for the RCAF Lancaster. * On October 30, 1991, a Lockheed C-130 Hercules, part of Operation Boxtop, crashed about from the airfield, killing 4 of the 18 passengers and crew on impact, while pilot John Couch died of exposure following the crash. Couch was conducting a visual approach and descended into a hill due to a mistake regarding the plane's true location. A blizzard and the local terrain hampered subsequent rescue efforts by personnel from CFS Alert; USAF personnel from Thule Air Base south; 435 Transport and Rescue Squadron from CFB Winnipeg and 440 Transport and Rescue Squadron, from CFB Namao outside Edmonton (both squadrons are part of 17 Wing Winnipeg); 424 Squadron from CFB Trenton, Ontario; and 413 Transport and Rescue Squadron from CFB Greenwood, Nova Scotia. The crash investigation recommended all C-130s be retrofitted with ground proximity detectors. The crash and rescue efforts were the basis of the film Ordeal in the Arctic (1993). Institutions =Canadian Forces Station Alert= Since the beginning of the JAWS project, the Canadian Armed Forces had been interested in the establishment at Alert for several reasons: the JAWS facility extended Canadian sovereignty over a large uninhabited area which Canada claimed as its sovereign territory, and furthermore, its proximity to the Soviet Union made it of strategic importance. In fact, Alert is closer to Moscow (c. ) than it is to Ottawa (c. ). Thus, the possibility of utilizing the site for the purpose of intercepting radio signals was deemed to warrant a military presence. In 1950, Alert Airport was established. It is the only airport serving the settlement and is presently a part of CFS Alert. In 1956, the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), which was expanding its presence throughout the high Arctic with the construction of the Distant Early Warning Line radar network, established a building uphill from the DOT's JAWS station to house \\"High Arctic Long Range Communications Research\\", or signals intelligence operations. In 1957, Alert Wireless Station was conceived as an intercept facility to be jointly staffed by personnel from the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) and the RCAF. Five additional buildings were constructed: a mess, three barracks/accommodations buildings, and a power house and vehicle maintenance building, in addition to the existing operations building, built in 1956. The operations building housed the radio intercept and cryptographic equipment. On September 1, 1958, control of the station was transferred from the Air Force to the Army, and it officially began operations. The following decade saw a dramatic expansion of the station, with a correspondingly greater number of personnel stationed there. The February 1, 1968, unification of the RCN, RCAF and Canadian Army to form the Canadian Armed Forces saw Alert Wireless Station change its name to Canadian Forces Station Alert (CFS Alert). Its personnel were no longer drawn from only the Air Force or Navy, but primarily from the Canadian Forces Communications Command. A Bandvagn 206 with CFS Alert in the background, a military station operated by the Canadian Armed Forces. At its peak, CFS Alert had upwards of 215 personnel posted at any one time. The station became a key asset in the global ECHELON network of the US- UK-CAN-AUS-NZ intelligence sharing alliance, with Alert being privy to many secret Soviet communications regarding land-based and sea-based ICBM test launches and many operational military deployments. The first military women to serve in Alert arrived in 1980 as part of the Canadian Forces' Women In Non-Traditional Roles study. After its completion in 1983, women were fully authorized to serve in all roles. The first female commanding officer was Maj. Cathy Cowan, who took command in January 1996. The first female Station Warrant Officer (SWO), MWO Renee Hansen, was appointed in December 2017. Budget cuts to the Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces in 1994 and modernization of communications equipment saw CFS Alert downsized to approximately 74 personnel by 1997‚Äì1998, when most radio-intercept operations were remotely controlled by personnel at CFS Leitrim. Remaining personnel are responsible for airfield operations, construction/engineering, food service, and logistical/administrative support. Only six personnel are now responsible for actual operations, and control of the facility was passed to DND's Information Management Group following the disbanding of CF Communications Command with force restructuring and cutbacks in the mid-1990s. With Canada's commitment to the global war on terrorism following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., CFS Alert has received renewed and increased funding to expand its SIGINT capabilities. On April 1, 2009, the RCAF officially took responsibility for CFS Alert from Canadian Forces Information Operations Group (CFIOG). Civilian contractor As of April 13, 2006, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was reporting that the heating costs for the station had risen, as a consequence of which the military proposed to cut back on support trade positions by using private contractors. article mirror By 2008, maintenance operations on the station‚Äîincluding food and housekeeping services, vehicle maintenance, powerplant operation, and heating, electrical, and plumbing‚Äîhad been transferred to a civilian contractor. The contract was initially awarded to Canadian Base Operators (CBO), a subsidiary of Black & McDonald. In 2012, the contract was won by Nasittuq, a subsidiary of ATCO. =Dr. Neil Trivett Global Atmosphere Watch Observatory= The Dr. Neil Trivett Global Atmosphere Watch Observatory in June 2016. In 1975, technicians employed by the weather station began collecting flask samples for a greenhouse gas monitoring program. In 1980, this grew to include the weekly collection of filter-based aerosol samples for the Canadian Arctic Aerosol Sampling Network (CAASN). By 1984, the number of ongoing monitoring programs and the amount of experimental research had outgrown the abilities of the weather station to maintain, and plans were made for the construction of a permanent observatory. This observatory, located southwest of Lancaster Hall (more commonly known as the far transmitter building), was opened August 29, 1986. Originally known as the Alert Background Air Pollution Monitoring Network (BAPMoN) Observatory, it was subsequently renamed the Dr. Neil Trivett Global Atmosphere Watch Observatory in honour of the Environment Canada researcher who provided the impetus for its construction. The observatory employs two technicians, who reside at CFS Alert: an operator and an assistant operator (normally a university co-op student). It is managed by Environment and Climate Change Canada. Demographics While Alert has no permanent residents, it has been permanently inhabited since April 1950. This population, while initially small, grew to upwards of 250 in the 1970s and 80s, before being downsized in the 1990s when information gathering operations were relayed to CFS Leitrim near Ottawa for collation, reducing the on site staff considerably. Its current population ranges from a winter minimum of 65 to a summer maximum of 110, plus a variety of short-term visitors, who can swell the total to 150 or more. Geography Orthographic projection centred over Alert, Nunavut. Alert is located west of Cape Sheridan, the northeastern tip of Ellesmere Island, on the shore of the ice-covered Lincoln Sea. Alert lies just from the North Pole; the nearest Canadian city is Iqaluit, the capital of the territory of Nunavut, away. The settlement is surrounded by rugged hills and valleys. The shore is composed primarily of slate and shale. The sea is covered with sea ice for most of the year but the ice pack does move out in the summer, leaving open water. Evaporation rates are also very low, as average monthly temperatures are above freezing only in July and August. Other places on Ellesmere Island are the weather station at Eureka () and the Inuit community of Grise Fiord, , to the southwest and south, respectively. Siorapaluk ( to the south) is the nearest populated place in Greenland. Climate Alert (indicated by small text label near centre of image) within the Arctic region. Composite image showing extent of ice at September 15, 2008. U.S. Ambassador David Jacobson in front of Alert's welcome sign which features many fingerposts pointing to Canadian towns and cities. Alert has a polar climate, technically a tundra climate (ET) with characteristics of an ice cap climate (EF). There is complete snow cover for at least 10 months of the year on average and snow from one year persists into the next year in protected areas, but enough melts to prevent glaciation. The warmest month, July, has an average temperature of , with only July and August averaging above freezing, and those are also the months where well over 90% of the rainfall occurs. Alert is also very dry, the fourth-driest locality in Nunavut, averaging only of precipitation per year. Most of this occurs during the months of July, August and September, mostly in the form of snow. On average Alert sees of rain, the least of any place in Nunavut, between June and September. Alert sees very little snowfall during the rest of the year. September is usually the month with the heaviest snowfall. February is the coldest month of the year with a mean temperature of . The yearly mean, , is the second-coldest in Nunavut after Eureka. Snowfall can occur during any month of the year, and the average frost-free growing season in an average summer averages only five days. Being far north of the Arctic Circle, Alert experiences polar night from October 14 to February 28, and midnight sun from April 7 to September 4. There are two relatively short periods of twilight from about February 13 to March 22 and the second from September 19 to October 22. The civil polar night lasts from October 29 to February 11.Sunrise/Sunset/Sun Angle Calculator Nautical polar night‚Äîwhere 24 hours are in effect completely dark with only a marginal astronomical twilight‚Äîoccurs from November 19 to January 22.

The name is sometimes given by modern editors or translators as Ingvaeones, on the assumption that this is more likely to be the correct form, since an etymology can be formed for it as 'son of Yngvi', Yngvi occurring later as a Scandinavian divine name.Tacitus, Angricola and Germania, translated by Harold Mattingly, revised by J.B. Rives, Penguin Books 2009, Germania, 2 and note 6. Hence the postulated common group of closely related dialects of the \\"Ingvaeones\\" is called Ingvaeonic or North Sea Germanic.Sonderegger, Stefan (1979). Grundz√ºge deutscher Sprachgeschichte.

Handbuch zur Niederdeutschen Sprach und Literaturwissenschaft.1983. Tacitus' source categorized the Ingaevones near the ocean as one of the three tribal groups descended from the three sons of Mannus, son of Tuisto, progenitor of all the Germanic peoples, the other two being the Irminones and the Istaevones. According to the speculations of Rafael von Uslar, this threefold subdivision of the West Germanic tribes corresponds to archeological evidence from Late Antiquity. Pliny ca 80 CE in his Natural History (IV.28) lists the Ingaevones as one of the five Germanic races, the others being the Vandili, the Istvaeones, the Hermiones and the Bastarnae. According to him, the Ingaevones were made up of Cimbri, Teutons and Chauci. Stripped of its Latin ending, the Ingvaeon are the Ingwine, \\"friends of Ing\\" familiar from Beowulf, where Hrothgar is \\"Lord of the Ingwine\\"‚Äîwhether one of them or lord over them being ambiguous.

Ing, the legendary father of the Ingaevones/Ingvaeones derives his name from a posited proto-Germanic *Ingwaz, as Ing, Ingo or Inguio, son of Mannus. This is also the name applied to the Viking era deity Freyr, known in Sweden as Yngvi-FreyrFor Ing as an aspect of Freyr, see R. North, Heathen Gods in Old English Literature (Cambridge) 1997. and mentioned as Yngvi-Freyr in Snorri Sturluson'sNoted by John Grigsby, Beowulf & Grendel (London: Watkins) 2005:98 note 6. Ynglinga saga. Jacob Grimm, in his Teutonic Mythology considers this Ing to have been originally identical to the obscure Scandinavian Yngvi, eponymous ancestor of the Swedish royal house of the Ynglinga, the \\"Inglings\\" or sons of Ing. Ing appears in the set of verses composed about the 9th century and printed under the title The Old English Rune Poem by George Hickes in 1705:Hickes, Thesaurus of the Old Languages of the North, 1705, noted by Grigsby 2005:98. Ing w√¶s √¶rest mid Est-Denum Gesewen secgum, o√æ he si√∞√∞an est Ofer w√¶g gewat; w√¶n √¶fter ran; √ûus heardingas √æone h√¶le nemdun.John Grigsby provides the translation \\"Ing was among the East Danes first seen among men, til he departed [east? back?] over the sea; the wagon ran after; thus the hard-men [warriors?] named the hero.\\" Grigsby notes the return journey in a wagon over the sea of this obliquely referred-to god: \\" the presence of this deity might have been allowed to remain in the otherwise Christian poem on the grounds that by this rime Ing was regarded (as in some Anglian genealogies) as a great continental ancestor\\" (Grigsby 2005:99). An Ingui is also listed in the Anglo-Saxon royal house of BerniciaR. North 1997:42f. and was probably once seen as the progenitor of all Anglian kings.Grigsby 2005:99. Since the Ingaevones form the bulk of the Anglo-Saxon settlement in Britain, they were speculated by Noah Webster to have given England its name,Webster, Noah. Letters to a Young Gentleman Commencing His Education. S. Converse, 1823:105. and Grigsby remarks that on the continent \\"they formed part of the confederacy known as the 'friends of Ing' and in the new lands they migrated to in the 5th and 6th centuries. In time, they would name these lands Angle-land, and it is tempting to speculate that the word Angle was derived from, or thought of as a pun on, the name of Ing.\\" According to the Trojan genealogy in the , Mannus becomes Alanus and Ing, his son, becomes Neugio. The three sons of Neugio are named Boguarus, Vandalus and Saxo‚Äîfrom whom came the peoples of the Boguarii (Baiuvarii), the Vandals, the Saxons and Taringi (Thuringii). This account comes to the Historia by way of the 6th-century Frankish Table of Nations, which borrows directly from Tacitus..

Their total population was estimated to be about 1.7 million people in the early 21st century. They speak the Fon language, a member of the Gbe languages. The history of the Fon people is linked to the Dahomey kingdom, a well-organized kingdom by the 17th century but one that shared more ancient roots with the Aja people. The Fon people traditionally were a culture of an oral tradition and had a well-developed polytheistic religious system. They were noted by early 19th-century European traders for their N'Nonmiton practice or Dahomey Amazons ‚Äì which empowered their women to serve in the military, who decades later fought the French colonial forces in 1890.Robin Law (1993), The 'Amazons' of Dahomey, Paideuma: Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde, Bd. 39 (1993), pages 245-260 Most Fon today live in villages and small towns in mud houses with corrugated iron gable roofs. Cities built by the Fon include Abomey, the historical capital city of Dahomey on what was historically referred to by Europeans as the Slave Coast. These cities became major commercial centres for the slave trade. A significant portion of the sugar plantations in the French West Indies, particularly Haiti and Trinidad, were populated with slaves that came from the Slave Coast, through the lands of Ewe and Fon people.  Origin  Gbe language area. Map of the Fon (purple) and other ethnic groups, according to Capo (1998). Since the seventeenth century, the Fon have been concentrated in the Benin region and the southwestern part of Nigeria. The Fon people, like other neighboring ethnic groups in West Africa, remained an oral tradition society through late medieval era, without ancient historical records. According to these oral histories and legends, the Fon people originated in present-day Tado, a small Aja town now situated near the Togo-Benin border. Their earliest rulers were originally a part of the ruling class in the Aja kingdom of Allada (also called Ardra kingdom). The Aja people had a major dispute, one group broke up and these people came to be the Fon people who migrated to Allada with king Agasu. The sons of king Agasu disputed who should succeed him after his death, and the group split again, this time the Fon people migrated with Agasu's son Dogbari northwards to Abomey where they founded the kingdom of Dahomey sometime about 1620 CE. The Fon people have been settled there since, while the kingdom of Dahomey expanded in southeast Benin by conquering neighboring kingdoms. The oral history of the Fon further attributes the origins of the Fon people to the intermarrying between this migrating Allada-nu Aja group from the south with the Oyo-nu inhabitants in the (Yoruba) Kingdoms of the plateau. These Yorubas were known as the Igede, which the Ajas called the Gedevi.http://evenemenciel.travel/en/2012/08/15/the-kingdom-of-abomey/ The fusion of the immigrant Aja conquerors and the original Indigenous Yorubas of the Abomey plateau thus created a new culture, that of the Fon. Although these oral traditional origins have been passed down through the generations, they are not without controversy. The claim to an origin from within Allada is not recorded in contemporary sources before the late eighteenth century, and is likely a means of legitimating the claim and conquest of Allada by Dahomey in the 1720s. These claims can also be interpreted as a metaphorical expressions of cultural and political influences between kingdoms rather than actual kinship.  History  \\"Amazon King Apron\\", Dahomey : the nineteenth century While references and documented history about the Fon people are scant before the 17th century, there are abundant documents on them from the 17th century, particularly written by European travelers and traders to West African coasts. These memoirs mention Ouidah or Abomey. Among the most circulated texts are those of Archibald Dalzel, a slave trader who in 1793 wrote the legends, history and slave trading practices of the Fon people in a book titled the History of Dahomey.I. A. Akinjogbin (1966), Archibald Dalzel: Slave Trader and Historian of Dahomey, The Journal of African History, Cambridge University Press, Vol. 7, No. 1 (1966), pages 67-78 Modern era scholars have questioned the objectivity and accuracy of Dalzel, and to what extent his pioneering book on Fon people was a polemic or dispassionate scholarship. In the 19th century and early 20th century, as the French presence increased and then the colonial period began in the Benin and nearby regions, more history and novels with references to the Fon people appeared, such as those by √âdouard Fo√†,Le Dahomey, √âdouard Fo√† (1895), BnF: National Library of France (in French) N. Savariau,L'agriculture au Dahomey N. Savariau (1906), A. Challamel, Marseille, France, Exposition nationale (in French) Le Herisse and M.J. Herskovits' anthropological study on Fon people published in 1938. These histories suggest that Fon people's kingdom of Dahomey expanded in early 18th century, particularly during King Agaja's rule through the 1740s, reaching the Atlantic coast from their inland capital of Abomey. During this period, 200 years after Portugal had already settled in the Kongo people lands on the Atlantic coast of Central Africa in the 16th century, there were numerous plantations in the Caribbean and Atlantic coastline of South America, which had already created a booming demand for slaves from the European traders. The expanded territory of the Dahomey kingdom was well positioned to supply this transatlantic trade and the 18th and 19th century history of the Fon people is generally presented within this context. = Slavery, Bight of Benin = The Fon people did not invent slavery in Africa, nor did they have a monopoly on slavery nor exclusive slave trading activity. The institution of slavery long predates the origins of the Fon people in the Aja kingdom and the formation of the kingdom of Dahomey. The sub-Saharan and the Red Sea region, states Herbert Klein ‚Äì a professor of history, was already trading between 5,000 and 10,000 African slaves per year between 800 and 1600 CE, with a majority of these slaves being women and children. According to John Donnelly Fage ‚Äì a professor of history specializing in Africa, a \\"slave economy was generally established in the Western and Central Sudan by about the fourteenth century at least, and had certainly spread to the coasts around the Senegal and in Lower Guinea by the fifteenth century\\". { class=\\"wikitable floatright\\" + style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  Slave shipment between 1501 and 1867, by regionDavid Eltis and David Richardson (2015), Atlas of the Transatlantic Slave Trade, 2nd Edition, Yale University Press, ; Archive: Slave Route Maps, see Map 9; The transatlantic slave trade volume over the 350+ years involved an estimated 12.5 million Africans, almost every country that bordered the Atlantic Ocean, as well as Mozambique and the Swahili coast. - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background: silver;\\"  Region !! scope=\\"col\\"  Total embarked !! scope=\\"col\\"  Total disembarked - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Kongo people region  5.69 million  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background: #F4A460;\\"  Bight of Benin  2.00 million  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Bight of Biafra  1.6 million  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Gold Coast  1.21 million  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Windward Coast  0.34 million  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Sierra Leone  0.39 million  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Senegambia  0.76 million  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Mozambique  0.54 million  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background: silver;\\"  Brazil (South America)   4.7 million - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background: silver;\\" Rest of South America   0.9 million - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background: silver;\\" Caribbean   4.1 million - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background: silver;\\" North America   0.4 million - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background: silver;\\" Europe   0.01 million } By the 15th century, Songhay Empire rulers to the immediate north of the Fon people, in the Niger River valley, were already using thousands of captured slaves for agriculture. The demand for slave labor to produce sugarcane, cotton, palm oil, tobacco and other goods in the plantations of European colonies around the globe had sharply grown between 1650 and 1850. The Bight of Benin was already shipping slaves in the late 17th century, before the Fon people expanded their kingdom to gain control of the coast line. The Fon rulers and merchants, whose powers were established on the Atlantic coast between 1700 and 1740, entered this market. The Fon people were divided on how to respond to the slave demand. Some scholars suggest that Fon people and Dahomey rulers expressed intentions to curtail or end slave trading, states Elizabeth Heath, but historical evidence affirms that the Benin coastline including the ports of the Dahomey rulers and the Fon people became one of the largest exporter of slaves. The kingdom of Dahomey, along with its neighbors' kingdoms of Benin and Oyo Empire, raided for slaves and sold their captives into transatlantic slavery. The competition for captives, slaves and government revenues, amongst the African kingdoms, escalated the mutual justification and pressure. The captives were sold as slaves to the Europeans from the Bight of Benin (also called the Slave Coast), from the eighteenth to the nineteenth century. The Fon people were both victims and also victimized other ethnic groups. Some captives came from wars, but others came from systematic kidnapping within the kingdom or at the frontiers, as well as the caravans of slaves brought in by merchants from the West African interior. The kingdom of Dahomey of Fon people controlled the port Ouidah, from where numerous European slave ships disembarked. However, this was not the only port of the region and it competed with the ports controlled by other nearby kingdoms on the Bight of Benin and the Bight of Biafra. The Fon people, along with the neighboring ethnic groups such as the Ewe people, disembarked in French colonies to work as slaves in the plantations of the Caribbean and coasts of South America. They were initially called Whydah, which probably meant \\"people sold by Alladah\\". The word Whydah phonetically evolved into Rada, the name of the West African community that embarked in slave ships from the Bight of Benin, and is now found in Haiti, Saint Lucia, Trinidad, French Antilles and other nearby islands with French influence. In some Caribbean colonial documents, alternate spellings such as Rara are also found. The slave traders and ship owners of European colonial system encouraged competition, equipped the various kingdoms with weapons, which they paid for with slaves, as well as built infrastructure such as ports and forts to strengthen the small kingdoms. In 1804 slave trading from the Bight of Benin was banned by the Great Britain, in 1826 France's ban on slave purchase or trading came into effect, while Brazil banned slave imports and trading in 1851.CHRONOLOGY - Who banned slavery when? Reuters When slave exports ceased, the king of the Fon people shifted to agricultural exports to France, particularly palm oil, but used slaves to operate the plantations. The agricultural exports were not as lucrative as slave exports had been in past. To recover state revenues he leased the ports in his kingdom to the French through a signed agreement in late 19th century. The French interpreted the agreement as ceding the land and ports, while the Dahomey kingdom disagreed. The dispute led to a French attack in 1890, and annexation of the kingdom as a French colony in 1892. This started the colonial rule for the Fon people. =Colonial empire= The French rule removed the king and royals of the Fon people, much like the British and German colonial rule did in neighboring areas, but they all kept the system of plantations. The only difference, so states Patrick Manning ‚Äì a professor of World History specializing on Africa, for the next seventy years was that the French colonial state, instead of the former king of Fon people, now decided how the surplus (profits) from these plantations were to be spent. The French colonial administrators made some infrastructure improvements to improve the plantation profitability and logistics to serve French colonial interests. The French rulers targeted slavery in Benin, they outlawed capture of slaves, legally freed numerous slaves, but faced resistance and factional struggles from previous local slave owners running their farms. The slavery that continued included those that was lineage-related, who cohabited within families in the region. The Fon aristocracy adapted to the new conditions, by joining the ranks of administrators in the French rule. Taxes new to the Dahomey colony's people, which the French called imp√¥t, similar to those already practiced in France, were introduced on all ethnic groups, including the Fon people, by the colonial administrators. Payment of these were regularly resisted or just refused, leading to confrontations, revolts, arrests, prison terms and forced labor. These complaints gelled into an anti-colonial nationalism movement in which the Fon people participated. France agreed to autonomy to Dahomey in 1958, and full independence in 1960.  Religion  Some Fon people converted to Christianity or Islam under the influence of missionaries during the colonial era, in Benin and in French West Indies colonies, but many continued their traditional religious practices. While Islam arrived in the Benin area between 11th and 13th centuries, Christianity was adopted by Dahomey ruler Agonglo who came to power in 1789, and his Fon royalty supporters, with missionaries welcomed. According to Steven Mailloux, the missionaries attempted to integrate the old concepts of Fon people on cosmogenesis to be same as Adam-Eve, and their Legba to be Christian Satan, teachings that led to syncretism rather than abandonment. The Fon people, states Mary Turner, have generally proven to be highly resistant to Christianity and Islam, even when brought over as slaves in a new environment as evident in Afro-Jamaican and other African influenced cultures with ties to the Slave Coast. They have generally refused to accept innovative re-interpretation of Fon mythologies within the Abrahamic mythical framework., Quote: \\"They [Christian missionaries visiting Fon in Dahomey] cited one of the Fon creation myths (...) as a corrupted version of the Adam and Eve story. But the Fon were not persuaded by this interpretation. (..., the Fon people said:) 'But the missionaries, when they heard our [deities] name of Adanhu and Yewa, said our gods and theirs were all the same. They tried to teach us the rest about the beginning of man and woman, but the Dahomeans, the Fon, do not agree'. They say this is not their story. They know nothing about Legda trying to give fruit.\\" The priests of the Fon people, contrary to the expectations of the missionaries, adopted and re-interpreted Abrahamic myths into their own frameworks. =Traditional beliefs= The traditional Fon religion is regionally called Vodoun, Vodzu or Vodu, which is etymologically linked to Vodun ‚Äì a term that refers to their theological concept of \\"numerous immortal spirits and deities\\". The religious practice of the Fon people have four overlapping elements: public gods, personal or private gods, ancestral spirits, and magic or charms. Thus, the Vodoun religion is polytheistic. The Fon people have a concept of a female Supreme Being called Nana Buluku, who gave birth to the Mawu, Lisa and created the universe. After giving birth, the mother Supreme retired, and left everything to Mawu-Lisa (Moon-Sun, female-male) deities, spirits and inert universe. Mawu-Lisa created numerous minor imperfect deities. In Fon belief, the feminine deity Mawu had to work with trickster Legba and the snake Aido Hwedo to create living beings, a method of creation that imbued the good, the bad and a destiny for every creature including human beings. Only by appeasing lesser deities and Legba, in Fon theology, can one change that destiny. This appeasing requires rituals and offerings to the lesser gods and ancestral spirits, who are believed to have ability to do favors to human beings.Sara A. Rich (2009), The Face of \\"Lafwa\\": Vodou & Ancient Figurines Defy Human Destiny, Journal of Haitian Studies, Vol. 15, No. 1/2, Haitian Studies Association 20thAnniversary Issue (Spring/Fall 2009), pages 262-278 A typical traditional home compound of the Fon people has a Dexoxos, or ancestral shrine. The charms are locally called gbo, gris gris, ju ju, or obeah, involve leaves, herbs, smoke and these are offerings to public or personal gods of each family. In 1864, eight Fon people were executed in Haiti on allegations of murder and cannibalism from Voodoo. Later scholars have questioned the lack of evidence, and whether the Bizoton trial was a product of prejudice.Mike Dash (May 2013), The Trial That Gave Vodou A Bad Name, Smithsonian Magazine\\"Quote: \\"The prisoners were bullied, cajoled... (...) I can never forget the manner in which the youngest female prisoner, Roseide Sumera turned to the public prosecutor and said, 'Yes, I did confess what you assert, but remember how cruelly I was beaten before I said a word' ‚Äì Spenser St John, British minister to Haiti who witnessed the trial.\\" While many Fon identify as Christian, the majority continue to practice Benin's traditional religion Vodun. The Fon have priests and mediums who receive the spirits on the occasion of the great festivals. The cult of the sacred serpents in the temple of Whydah had some importance, but eventually fell into disuse.http://www.uned.es/sel/pdf/ene-jun-79/megenny%2079.pdf EL ELEMENTO SUBSAH√ÅRICO EN EL L√âXICO venezolano (in Spanish: The Subsaharian element in the Venezuelan lexicon) Practice can involve drumming to induce possession by one of these gods or spirits. Together with other cultural groups from the Fon homeland region such as the Yoruba and Bantu, Fon culture merged with French, Portuguese or Spanish to produce distinct religions (Voodoo, Mami Wata, Candombl√© and Santer√≠a), dance and musical styles (Arar√°, Yan Valu). In the French colonies, such as Saint-Domingue (now Haiti), the Christian missionaries confiscated and burnt the statues and religious objects of the Fon people, but this did not end their practices. They rebuilt their icons again.Michael Laguerre (1973), The place of Voodoo in the Social Structure of Haiti, Caribbean Quarterly, Vol. 19, No. 3 (Sept 1973), pages 36-50 The Fon people and their government have reversed the colonial attempts to culturally change them. After the end of the colonial era, January 10 has been declared an official annual holiday in Benin dedicated to Vodun gods.  Society and culture  The Fon people are traditionally settled farmers, growing cassava, corn and yams as staples. The men prepare the fields, women tend and harvest the crop. Hunting and fishing are other sources of food, while some members of the Fon society make pottery, weave clothes and produce metal utensils. Among the cash crops, palm oil plantations are common in Fon people's region. The Fon culture is patrilineal and allows polygyny and divorce. A man with multiple wives usually lived in a compound with each wife and her children occupying a separate hut. A collection of compounds formed a village, usually headed by a hereditary chief. In contemporary times, tradition patrilineal clan-based living and associated practices are uncommon. Funerals and death anniversaries to remember their loved ones are important events, including drumming and dancing as a form of mourning and celebrating their start of life as a spirit by the one who died, can last for days. The Fon culture incorporated culture and shared ideas with ethnic groups that have been their historical neighbors. Many of their practices are found among Yoruba people, Akan people, Ewe people and others. =Dahomey Amazons= A notable part of the Fon people's society was their use of female soldiers in combat roles over some two centuries. Over 3,000 women trained and served as regular warriors to protect the Fon and to expand its reach. The women warrior's brigade was led by a woman.Dahomey‚Äôs Women Warriors, Smithsonian Magazine Given the oral tradition of Fon people, when women joined as warriors in Fon society is unclear. The earliest European records, such as those of Jean-Pierre Thibault, suggest that the tradition dates back to the early 18th century or even earlier. These gender roles were foreign to the European travelers, and early fictional stories in European media are considered unreliable by many scholars.

Wallace Foster Davenport (30 June 1925 ‚Äì 18 March 2004) was an American jazz trumpeter. Davenport has been one of the few traditional jazz musicians of the 1930s who later branched out into swing and bop styles, as well as backing gospel and R&B; vocalists during an extensive career in eight different decades. Davenport was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. He started on trumpet at age 13 with The Young Tuxedo Brass Band. He played with Papa Celestin in 1941 before leaving New Orleans to serve in the U. S. Navy. Davenport returned there after the World War II, making an easy transition to swing and bop with various bands. He recorded with Roy Brown in 1947. During the 1950s he toured the US and Europe playing with Lionel Hampton, and recorded in Paris in the mid-'50 with Mezz Mezzrow. Davenport played and recorded with the Count Basie jazz orchestra (1964‚Äì1966), and also toured with singers Ray Charles and Lloyd Price. In 1969 he went back to doing traditional jazz in New Orleans, and issued recordings of his groups playing this style from on his own label My Jazz (1971‚Äì1976); recorded again in Europe with George Wein in 1974, with Panama Francis and Arnett Cobb in 1976, and also reunited with Hampton and recorded with Earl Hines this same year. In the eighties, Davenport worked with both traditional units as The Alliance Hall Dixieland Band and gospel groups like The Zion Harmonizers and Aline White, and backed the vocalists Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis, Jr. However, he routinely went on impromptu tours in Asia and Europe, and once played expressly for the king Olav V of Norway. A cultural icon of New Orleans, Davenport played regularly at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and the French Quarter Festival. He received numerous awards and recognitions for his musical contributions from the city government and local arts groups. Wallace Davenport died in New Orleans, Louisiana, at 78 years of age.

Appointed by President Bill Clinton, he served for most of Clinton's first term. He was succeeded by William Kennard. Hundt is the CEO and co-founder of the Coalition for Green Capital, a non-profit engaged in the creation of green banks in the United States and internationally, and Making Every Vote Count, a non-profit advocating to have electors in the Electoral College adhere to the national popular vote in selecting the President. He was also on the board of Intel Corporation 2001-20, and is on the board of Smart Sky Networks, Inteliquent, and the Connecticut Green Bank. He was a senior adviser to the law firm, Covington, in Washington, D.C., from 2014 to 2019, and lives in Bethesda, Maryland, and Portola Valley, California.  Biography  Hundt attended high school in Washington D.C. at St. Albans School, graduating in 1965. He went to Yale College, where he majored in history, and worked on the Yale Daily News. Hundt taught school for several years before graduating from Yale Law School in 1974. He clerked for Harrison Lee Winter, a Baltimore judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, before moving to Los Angeles, where he became the 85th lawyer at Latham & Watkins, one of the top law firms in the world. In 1980, Hundt moved to the Latham & Watkins' Washington, D.C., office. In his litigation career at the firm, Hundt appeared in court in 48 states and the District of Columbia, argued appellate cases in almost all circuits, and handled cases in many topic areas, although he specialized in antitrust. Meanwhile, from 1983 and onwards, Hundt played many diverse roles in helping Al Gore's political career. In 1992-3 he was part of the Clinton- Gore transition team, and chaired the committee that drafted the partly successful carbon tax introduced and passed in the House of Representatives in 1993. It was not passed through the Senate. The issue remains alive to this day. In 1993 President Clinton, whom Hundt had known in law school, nominated Hundt to be chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. He was confirmed in November 1993, which was approximately the same time that the Internet became commercially viable because of the confluence of the first popular browser, Mosaic, and the decision of the CERN laboratory to release for free the Berners-Lee World Wide Web software protocols that enabled any connected computer to navigate the Internet. Serendipitously, that same month saw Congress empower the FCC to create the structure and function of the digital cellular market in the United States by means, among other things, of spectrum auctions, then having previously been tried only in isolated cases in small countries. Congress gave the FCC vast powers to regulate and de-regulate all digital markets when it passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, signed by digital signature of President Clinton in the Library of Congress in February 1996. The FCC then essentially re-wrote the regulatory landscape for wireless and wireline communication. Not everything predicted actually occurred, in Hundt's view, but all knew that somehow the communications sector was responsible in large part for the great boom in the American economy and stock market that marked the Clinton Administration's two terms. Hundt currently serves on the audit committee of Gore's chief non-profit. Hundt himself is CEO of the Coalition for Green Capital, a non-profit he helped found in the wake of his service on the Obama transition team in 2008-9. He is also CEO of Making Every Vote Count, a non-profit seeking to educate the public on the failures of the current presidential selection system in the US and how Americans would be better served if the person who won the most votes were guaranteed to be president. Between 1998 and 2008, Hundt was a senior advisor to McKinsey, the consulting firm. He also served on many technology company boards from 1998 to the present, co-founded four firms (none of which was wildly successful), gave many speeches, wrote four books, and penned numerous articles. He has written \\"You Say You Want A Revolution: A Story of Information Age Politics\\" (Yale:2000) and \\"In China's Shadow: The Crisis of American Entrepreneurship\\" (Yale: 2006) as part of the Future of American Democracy Foundation's Future of American Democracy Series. Additionally, Hundt published e-books entitled Zero Hour: Time to Build the Clean Power Platform (Odyssey, 2013) and, along with Blair Levin, The Politics of Abundance: How Technology Can Fix the Budget, Revive the American Dream and Establish Obama's Legacy (Odyssey: 2012). Most recently, Hundt has written A Crisis Wasted: Barack Obama's Defining Decisions (RosettaBooks: 2019).

He was an early member of 808 State, and later achieved success as a solo artist. He is best known for his early work in the Manchester acid house scene in the late 1980sIMO Records. \\"A Guy Called Gerald Biography\\", IMO Records, Retrieved 24 February 2012. and the track \\"Voodoo Ray\\". His style developed during the early 1990s, and his 1995 album Black Secret Technology would become a \\"much-touted candidate for 'best jungle album ever.' Early influences and music Simpson was influenced by his Jamaican roots; his father's blue beat, ska and Trojan reggae record collection, his mother's Pentecostal church sessions and the Jamaican sound system parties in Manchester's Moss Side area where he grew up. He absorbed jazz fusion and electro funk at clubs, youth clubs and shebeens such as Legends, St.Alfonso's, British Legion and the Reno in Manchester, where the dancefloor in the early 1980s inspired him to study contemporary dance. Manchester was a hotbed of dance music with black club nights open every night of the week and Simpson spent his time joining in the vibe. Around 1983 with electro booming and early hip hop, breakdancing and b-boy culture making its way from the US, he left dance college to immerse himself in electronic music production. At this time music from Detroit and Chicago ‚Äì from producers such as Juan Atkins, Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson was being played by Stu Allen on Piccadilly Radio and imported directly into Manchester's specialist record shops. Inspired, Simpson began experimenting with tape editing and drum machines and the regular jams in the attic of his house led to forming the Scratchbeat Masters. Using cut up beats, samples and turntables they would challenge other bands and their sound systems. They released a 12\\" single called \\"Wax on the Melt\\", a collaboration between a number of crews and Graham Massey and Martin Price together with whom he would later form 808 State. Their first album, Newbuild, was released in 1988, but he soon left the group to concentrate on his solo work.  Early releases and dance music in Manchester  The result of heading back into his bedroom studio was \\"Voodoo Ray\\", played first at the Hacienda in 1988, and then the underground clubs before entering the UK Singles Chart a year later. It was the first acid house track produced in the UK, and released on a small Merseyside independent label (Rham! Records) based in Wallasey. \\"Voodoo Ray\\" entered the UK chart in 1989 rising to number 12. Much is written about the influence of the Hacienda and the rave scene on his music, however Simpson was more influenced by dancers such as Foot Patrol and the Jazz Defektors, regulars in the North of England black club scene. Greg Wilson, an influential Northern UK DJ and music writer explains on his blog: \\"A Guy Called Gerald provides the perfect analogy for what happened in Manchester. Most people would assume that he went to The Ha√ßienda, heard this incredible House music for the first time, had an epiphany, and then went home and set to work on the era defining single 'Voodoo Ray' (which he wrote with Foot Patrol in mind, visualising how they might dance to it). The reality, of course, is that Gerald and his contemporaries were those very kids from Hulme and Moss Side, who brought House music into The Ha√ßienda in the first place. Gerald had already been on the black scene for many years, dancing to Jazz-Funk, then Electro, before starting out with the Scratch Beatmasters as a Hip Hop DJ (MC Tunes rapping). 'Voodoo Ray' isn‚Äôt an orthodox House track, but a culmination of his influences ‚Äì The Ha√ßienda providing the perfect setting in which to unleash this quintessential British dance track. Inadvertently bestowing Gerald with his name was Stu Allan ‚Äì prior to 'Voodoo Ray', on playing a track he‚Äôd been given on tape by a local newcomer, he told his Piccadilly listeners that it was by a guy called Gerald from Hulme.\\" At the same time a track Simpson started before leaving 808 State, \\"Pacific State\\", was released and hit the charts. However, according to Simpson, they had finished and released the track without his permission. Although Simpson was credited on its first release on the album Quadrastate both as a writer and co-producer, the dispute escalated as Simpson claimed to have written the entire track. In 1991, after CBS / Sony released Automanikk, he started his own label, Juice Box Records, releasing a string of 12\\" singles ‚Äì the seeds of what became known as jungle and later drum and bass. The first singles were compiled and released on his third album 28 Gun Bad Boy (1992). In 1995, his next album, Black Secret Technology was released. A remastered version was re-issued in June 2008.

It is regarded as the first full-length jungle album ever released. Reynolds also stated in a Melody Maker article in October 1994, about Simpson's Juice Box-era music, \\"Gerald's tracks take the jungle mesh of polyrhythms, cross-rhythms and counter-rhythms to new levels of insane detail.\\" Gerald's Black Secret Technology LP was released in 1995 and reached the UK Albums Chart at number 64, including contributions from Goldie and Finley Quaye, In 1998, the label closed, with Simpson relocating to New York.  1997‚Äì2013 releases  In 1997, he moved to New York and, in 2000, released Essence on the independent label !K7 Records.

If the brief reign of Clovis III (675) is ignored as a usurpation, then Clovis IV may be numbered Clovis III. A member of the Merovingian dynasty, Clovis was the son of King Theuderic III and Queen Chrodochild. He was born around 677 or possibly towards 682. He succeeded his father as the sole ruler of the Franks upon the latter's death in 690 or 691. He ruled an undivided kingdom including Austrasia, Burgundy and Neustria. According to the Annals of Metz, a pro-Pippinid source, he was appointed by Pippin of Herstal, the mayor of the palace of Austrasia, and reigned four years. Clovis was a minor at his accession, and real power was in Pippin's hands. His minority, coming as it did on the heels of his father's efforts to strengthen royal power, was an important factor in the decline of the Merovingian dynasty. Clovis III resided primarily in Compi√®gne (the traditional site of the Marchfield) and Montmacq. Nine of Clovis's charters have been edited and published. Four of them are records of placita (public judicial hearings) held in the king's presence. Despite the rise of Pippin and his family, which is a major theme of the Annals of Metz, the royal court was still important in Clovis's reign. During a placitum in Valenciennes in 693, Clovis was attended by twelve bishops, twelve viri illustres (including Nordebert, the Neustrian mayor of the palace), nine counts and numerous other officials. The future Neustrian mayor of the palace Ragamfred started out as a domesticus under Clovis. Warno, the Neustrian comes palatii of Chilperic II, also began his career at the court of Clovis. In 692, Clovis confirmed for the Abbey of Saint-Denis the right to collect certain tolls in Marseille, a right which it had been granted by Dagobert I. He also granted to the Abbey of Saint-M√©dard the nearby house that had been the primary residence of the former mayor of the palace, Ebroin, in Soissons. The anonymous continuator of the Chronicle of Fredegar devotes two sentences to Clovis IV: \\"King Theuderic died ... and his little son Clovis was chosen to succeed him as king. But it was not long before King Clovis fell ill and died, having reigned four years.\\" He died in either 694 or 695. He was succeeded by his brother, Childebert III. Clovis does not appear to have made much of an impression on his contemporaries; his brother was more highly regarded.

It is located on the western shore of Ellef Ringnes Island in the Sverdrup Islands, in the territory of Nunavut in Canada. Isachsen Station was established to participate in a joint Canadian-American weather observation program. Isachsen Station operated from April 3, 1948 through September 19, 1978. Regular weather observations began on May 3, 1948. In October 1949, a Douglas C-47 Skytrain (tail number 316062) crash-landed near the station. No one was killed, but three on board were injured. The wreckage has been preserved by the cold weather and dry conditions. Climate According to Environment and Climate Change Canada, Isachsen and the surrounding area has the worst weather in Canada with a Climate Severity Index of 99 out of a possible 100. Flora and fauna There are neither trees nor shrubs that can live this far north. The plant life here is limited to small patches of moss, lichens, and a few tiny flowering plants. The wildlife here is limited to polar bears, Arctic foxes, caribou, Arctic hares, lemmings, seals, muskoxen, and migratory birds. History and background On October 9, 1949, a U.S. Air Force C-47 cargo plane crashed on takeoff at the weather station. The plane had ten people on board: a U.S. Air Force crew of six and four civilian passengers. The passengers were two U.S. weather bureau employees, a Canadian weather bureau employee, and an RCMP constable. Three of the aircrew received cuts and bruises and everyone else escaped injury. The subsequent investigation blamed the accident on the plane being overloaded and attempting to take off with ice building up on the cockpit windshield and wings. At the time of the crash, there were of snow on the mud runway, a light snowfall and some fog.The Crashed U.S. Air Force Plane at Isachsen, oldwings.nl. The wreck was briefly shown in the Polar Special episode of the BBC program Top Gear. Photos of the remains of Isachsen Station can be seen on the Hilux Arctic Challenge website, taken by the Top Gear team on their trip to the nearby 1996 North Magnetic Pole. The footage of the wreck was filmed on May 2, 2007. The episode first aired on July 25, 2007.Arctic C-47 Wreck at Isachsen, Canada, oldwings.nl. During the 1950s, Isachsen Station was primarily collecting radiosonde observations. Along with weather soundings from similar stations such as Mould Bay, Eureka, and Alert, this information was used to complete the North American data, primarily used to produce weather forecasts over the North Atlantic Ocean, Greenland, and Iceland, and long-range weather forecasts for Western Europe. The Isachsen Station was located in an extremely isolated place, with supplies and new personnel flown in by the Royal Canadian Air Force, usually twice a year: in the late spring, and again in the early fall from an air base (now Resolute Bay Airport) at Resolute on Cornwallis Island. In turn, Resolute Station, like most northern communities, was supplied using ocean-going cargo ships aided by icebreakers during the late summer sealift. The eight-man staff at Isachsen usually consisted of four Americans and four Canadians. The Americans were usually two weather observers, a cook, and a mechanic. The Canadians were usually two weather observers and two radio operators. All communication to and from Isachsen Station was via shortwave radio radiotelegraphy. Fuel oil and diesel fuel for heating and cooking, and for the station's electric generators, respectively, were shipped to Isachsen by transport planes in standard metal fuel barrels. During the summer of 1958, the Isachsen station was rebuilt using prefabricated buildings that had been airlifted in along with about a dozen construction personnel. The sun sets in October and it is totally dark for about three months with temperatures from . In the summer, the sun is visible above the horizon 24 hours a day for about three months with temperatures from about . In 1956, a plan by the Government of Canada to resettle the Inuit people at several high Arctic locations was scrapped. These settlements would have included Isachsen, Alert, Eureka, and Mould Bay. On October 31, 1971, the United States withdrew from participation in the weather program at the site. In 1971, the Canadian government made a significant investment in Isachsen to upgrade its buildings. Then, in 1978, as a cost-cutting measure, the government decided to close one high Arctic station; Isachsen Station was selected, and it was closed down during that same year. The last manned weather observations were taken on July 31, 1978. An Automated Surface Observing System was placed at the site in 1989, linked by satellite communications to southern Canada. Isachsen is now uninhabited. During the summers of 1989 and 1992, the closed weather station at Isachsen was the site of the High Arctic Psychology Research Station. The HAPRS operated under the aegis of the Polar Psychology Project, an international and transpolar multi-year program. Each time, six or seven researchers used each other as participants in investigations of the effects of isolation, remoteness, and cold on psychological and physiological processes such as taste perception, irritability, mood, subjective and hormonal measures of stress, brain waves, and sleep patterns. In 1992, a survey was made of abandoned vehicles, fuel drums, and potential contaminants to assist Environment Canada in planning to remove such items from the site.

Later accounts state that he was the confessor of the queen of Bohemia and refused to divulge the secrets of the confessional. On the basis of this account, John of Nepomuk is considered the first martyr of the Seal of the Confessional, a patron against calumnies and, because of the manner of his death, a protector from floods and drowning. Basic biographical information Jan z Pomuku came from the small market town of Pomuk (later renamed Nepomuk) in Bohemia, now in the Czech Republic, which belonged to the nearby Cistercian abbey. Born in the 1340s, his father was a certain Velfl√≠n (Welflin, W√∂lflin) and his mother is unknown. His father's name is probably diminutive of the German name Wolfgang.Bernard L. Fontana, A Gift of Angels: The Art of Mission San Xavier Del Bac (Tucson 2010), p.298. Jan first studied at the University of Prague, then furthered his studies in canon law at the University of Padua from 1383 to 1387. In 1393 he was made the vicar-general of Saint Giles Cathedral by Jan of Jen≈°tejn (1348‚Äì1400), who was the Archbishop of Prague from 1378 to 1396. In the same year, on 20 March, he was tortured and thrown into the river Vltava from Charles Bridge in Prague by order of King Wenceslaus IV. Martyrdom of St. John Nepomuk by Szymon Czechowicz, National Museum in Warsaw. The Dead Body of John of Nepomuk on the banks of the Vltava cca 1760 by Franz Xaver Palko. At issue was the appointment of a new abbot for the rich and powerful Benedictine Abbey of Kladruby; its abbot was a territorial magnate whose resources would be crucial to Wenceslaus in his struggles with nobles. Wenceslaus at the same time was backing the Avignon papacy, whereas the Archbishop of Prague followed its rival, the pope at Rome. Contrary to the wishes of Wenceslaus, John confirmed the archbishop's candidate for Abbot of Kladruby, and was drowned on the emperor's orders on 20 March 1393. This account is based on four contemporary documents. The first is the accusation of the king, presented to Pope Boniface IX on 23 April 1393, by Archbishop John of Jen≈°tejn, who immediately went to Rome together with the new abbot of Kladruby. Pubitschka, Gesch., IV, app.; Pelzel ed., \\"Geschichte K√∂nig Wenzels\\", I: \\"Urkundenbuch\\", 143-63 A few years later Abbott Ladolf of Sagan listed John of Nepomuk in the catalog of Sagan abbots, completed in 1398,l'ed. Stenzel in \\"Scrittura. il rerum Silesiacarum\\", I, 1835, pp. 213 sqq. as well as in the treatise \\"De long√¶vo schismate\\", lib. VII, c. xix.Archiv f√ºr √∂sterreichische Geschichte, LX, 1880, pp. 418 sq. A further document is the \\"Chronik des Deutschordens\\"/Chronik des Landes Preussen, a chronicle of the Teutonic Order compiled by John of Posilge, who died in 1405.\\"Scriptores rerum Prussicarum\\", III, Leipzig 1860 -, 87 In the above accusation, John of Jen≈°tejn already calls John of Nepomuk a \\"saint martyr\\". The biography of the bishop (written by his chaplain) describes John of Nepomuk as \\"gloriosum Christi martyrem miraculisque coruscum\\" (in English: \\"a glorious martyr of Christ and sparkling with miracles\\"). Thus, the vicar put to death for defending the laws and the autonomy of the Catholic Church became revered as a saint directly after his death. Later accounts The prototypical statue of John of Nepomuk at Charles Bridge in Prague, at the site where the saint was thrown into Vltava. Made by Jan Brokoff upon a model by Matthias Rauchmiller in 1683, on the supposed 300th anniversary of the saint's death, which was until the mid-18th century presumed to have happened in 1383. It was the basis for a number of statues of the saint all across the Europe. Cross on the bridge of St. John of Nepomuk St. John of Nepomuk in Buchach, Ukraine. Made by Johann Georg Pinsel, 1750 (copy) Much additional biographical information comes from Bohemian annalists who wrote 60 or more years after the events they recount. Although they may have taken advantage of sources not available today, their contribution is considered legendary by many historians, particularly by the Protestant ones. *In his chronicle Chronica regum Romanorum, completed in 1459, Thomas Ebendorfer (d. 1464) states that King Wenceslaus had drowned the confessor (the priest who heard the confession) of his wife, indicated as Magister Jan, because he had stated that only the one who rules properly deserves the name of king and had refused to betray the seal of Confession. This is the first source to mention this refusal as a motivation of the condemnation of John of Nepomuk. * In his Instructions for the King, completed in 1471, Paul Zidek provides further details.cf. Schmude in \\"Zeitschrift f√ºr kathol. Theologie\\", 1883, 90 sqq. King Wenceslaus was afraid that his wife had a lover. As she was used to confessing to Magister Jan, King Wenceslaus ordered him to reveal the name of the lover, but to no avail. Therefore, the king ordered John to be drowned. Note that in these chronicles neither the date of the events nor the name of the queen is mentioned. * In 1483 John of Krumlov, dean of St. Vitus cathedral, states that John died in 1383 (one decade earlier than the recognized date, perhaps due to a transcription error).St. John of Nepomuk official website, SJN.cz As the first wife of Wenceslaus died in 1386, this change of date also causes uncertainty about the name of the queen.The first queen was Johanna of Bavaria; the second one was her cousin Sofia of Bavaria. The mistake of John of Krumlov crept into the Annales BohemorumKronika ƒçesk√°, first printed in Bohemian, Prague 1541; then translated in German and after two centuries also in Latin by Gelasius Dobner (6 volumes., Prague, 1761‚Äì83). of Wenceslaus Hajek of Liboczan (V√°clav H√°jek z Liboƒçan), the \\"Bohemian Livy\\". He suggested that two Jan di Nepomuks may have existed and have both been killed by King Wenceslaus. The first one is the queen's confessor, who died in 1383; the other the vicar of the archbishop, who disagreed with the king on the election of the abbot of Kladruby and was drowned in 1393. As Hajek's annals enjoyed a wide success, they influenced all subsequent historians for two centuries, up to the Latin edition, critically annotated by the translator, which considerably reduced Hajek's credit as a reliable historian. Further and less reliable details about John of Nepomuk come from the annalists of the 17th and 18th centuries. Boleslaus Balbinus, S.J., in his Vita b. Joannis Nepomuceni martyrisBohuslav Balbinus. Vita beati Joannis Nepomuceni martyris, Praga, 1670; It was reprinted in the Bollandists' Acta sanctorum III, May, pp 668‚Äì80. gives the most rich account. Although the theory of Hajek of Liboczan has no credit today, some historians believe the vicar's refusal to betray the seal of the confessional might have been the secret reason why Wenceslaus took vengeance on John of Nepomuk as soon as a credible excuse provided the opportunity. A controversial figure 1732 monument on Cathedral Island in Wroc≈Çaw, by Jan Ji≈ôi Urbansky Catholics see John of Nepomuk as a martyr to the cause of defending the Seal of the Confessional. Romantic nationalists regard him as a Czech martyr to imperial interference. Most historians present him as a victim of a late version of the inveterate investiture controversy between secular rulers and the Catholic hierarchy. The connection of John of Nepomuk with the inviolability of the confessional is part of the transformation of an historical figure into a legend, which can be traced through successive stages. The archbishop, who hastened to Rome soon after the crime, in his charge against Wenceslaus, called the victim a martyr; in the vita written a few years later miracles are already recorded, by which the drowned man was discovered. About the middle of the 15th century the statement appears for the first time that the refusal to violate the seal of confession was the cause of John's death. Two decades later (1471), the dean of Prague, Paul Zidek, makes John the queen's confessor. The chronicler Wenceslaus Hajek speaks in 1541 (perhaps due to an incorrect reading of his sources) of two Johns of Nepomuk being drowned; the first as confessor, the second for his confirmation of the abbot. The place on the bridge parapet where John of Nepomuk was thrown into the Vltava. The legend is especially indebted for its growth to the Jesuit historiographer Boleslaus Balbinus the \\"Bohemian Pliny\\", whose Vita beati Joannis Nepomuceni martyris was published in Prague, 1670. Although the Prague metropolitan chapter did not accept the biography dedicated to it, \\"as being frequently destitute of historical foundation and erroneous, a bungling work of mythological rhetoric\\", Balbinus stuck to it. In 1683 the Charles Bridge was adorned with a statue of the saint, which has had numerous successors; in 1708 the first church was dedicated to him at Hradec Kr√°lov√©; a more famous Pilgrimage Church of Saint John of Nepomuk was founded in 1719. Meanwhile, in spite of the objection of the Jesuits, the process was inaugurated which ended with his canonisation. On 31 May 1721, he was beatified, and on 19 March 1729, he was canonised under Pope Benedict XIII. The acts of the process, comprising 500 pages, distinguish two Johns of Nepomuk and sanction the cult of the one who was drowned in 1383 as a martyr of the sacrament of penance. According to some Protestant sources, the figure of John Nepomuk is a legend due to Jesuits and that its historical kernel is really Jan Hus, who was metamorphosed from a Bohemian Reformer into a Roman Catholic saint: the Nepomuk story would be based on Wenceslaus Hajek's blending of the Jan who was drowned in 1393 and the Jan who was burned in 1415. The resemblances are certainly striking, extending to the manner of celebrating their commemorations. But when the Jesuits came to Prague, the Nepomuk veneration had long been widespread; and the idea of canonization originated in opposition not to the Hussites, but to Protestantism, as a weapon of the Counter-Reformation. In the image of the saint which gradually arose is reflected the religious history of Bohemia. A coincidental drought in the region a year later helped the legend along; the church convinced the peasants that the drought represented God's punishment for the killing of Jan Nepomuck√Ω. Building on that success, they attempted to paint the king as even blacker, with certain clerical circles spreading reports of John's courage, saying that as confessor to the Queen he had refused to reveal her secrets, and that was why he had been murdered. Belief in John's supernatural powers culminated with the discovery of his supposed tongue when three centuries later his tomb was opened and a piece of reddened tissue fell out of his skull. Regional significance The figure of Saint John of Nepomuk is often encountered in Central Europe, including the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Croatia, Slovenia, Germany, Italy, Poland, Lithuania, and, although rarely, Ukraine. He is usually portrayed with a halo of five stars, commemorating the stars that hovered over the Vltava River on the night of his murder. Other attributes useful to identify his pictures are: a priestly dress, the palm of martyrs, carrying a cross, an angel indicating silence by a finger over the lips. His tomb, a Baroque monument cast in silver and silver-gilt that was designed by Fischer von Erlach, stands in St Vitus Cathedral, Prague. St. John of Nepomuk's Tomb in St Vitus Cathedral, Prague  Statue usage  A statue of Saint John of Nepomuk has often been erected on bridges in many countries, such as on the Ponte Milvio in Rome. The one in Prague was extremely popular as late as the 19th Century, when people traveled from Tyrol, Hungary, and particularly Bohemia to Prague to celebrate his feast day, May 16.Chamber's Book of Days, 1871, p. 640. There is a white statue of St. John of Nepomuk in the small village of Divina, in Slovakia. There is also a commemorative plaque on a bridge leading out of Obergurgl, Austria depicting Nepomuk holding a finger to his lips, as if protecting a secret.

Structure Diagrammatic section of scalp Illustration of the scalp and meninges The scalp is usually described as having five layers, which can conveniently be remembered as a mnemonic: * S: The skin on the head from which head hair grows. It contains numerous sebaceous glands and hair follicles. * C: Connective tissue. A dense subcutaneous layer of fat and fibrous tissue that lies beneath the skin, containing the nerves and vessels of the scalp. * A: The aponeurosis called epicranial aponeurosis (or galea aponeurotica) is the next layer. It is a tough layer of dense fibrous tissue which runs from the frontalis muscle anteriorly to the occipitalis posteriorly. * L: The loose areolar connective tissue layer provides an easy plane of separation between the upper three layers and the pericranium. In scalping the scalp is torn off through this layer. It also provides a plane of access in craniofacial surgery and neurosurgery. This layer is sometimes referred to as the \\"danger zone\\" because of the ease by which infectious agents can spread through it to emissary veins which then drain into the cranium. The loose areolar tissue in this layer is made up of random collagen I bundles, collagen III. It will also be rich in glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and will be constituted of more matrix than fibers. This layer allows the more superficial layers of the scalp to shift about in relation to the pericranium. * P: The pericranium is the periosteum of the skull bones and provides nutrition to the bone and the capacity for repair. It may be lifted from the bone to allow removal of bone windows (craniotomy). The clinically important layer is the aponeurosis. Scalp lacerations through this layer mean that the \\"anchoring\\" of the superficial layers is lost and gaping of the wound occurs which would require suturing. This can be achieved with simple or vertical mattress sutures using a non-absorbable material, which are subsequently removed at around days 7-10. =Blood supply= The blood supply of the scalp is via five pairs of arteries, three from the external carotid and two from the internal carotid: * internal carotid ** the supratrochlear artery to the midline forehead. The supratrochlear artery is a branch of the ophthalmic branch of the internal carotid artery. ** the supraorbital artery to the lateral forehead and scalp as far up as the vertex. The supraorbital artery is a branch of the ophthalmic branch of the internal carotid artery. * external carotid ** the superficial temporal artery gives off frontal and parietal branches to supply much of the scalp ** the occipital artery which runs posteriorly to supply much of the posterior aspect of the scalp ** the posterior auricular artery, a branch of the external carotid artery, ascends behind the auricle to supply the scalp above and behind the auricle. Because the walls of the blood vessels are firmly attached to the fibrous tissue of the superficial fascial layer, cut ends of vessels here do not readily retract; even a small scalp wound may bleed profusely. Venous drainage The veins of the scalp accompany the arteries and thus have similar names, e.g. Supratrochlear and supraorbital veins, which unite at the medial angle of the eye, and form the angular vein, which further continues as the facial vein. The superficial temporal vein descends in front of the tragus, enters the parotid gland, and then joins the maxillary vein to form the retromandibular vein. The anterior part of it unites with the facial vein to form the common facial vein, which drains into jugular vein, and ultimately to the subclavian vein. The occipital vein terminates to the sub-occipital plexus. There are other veins, like the emissary vein and frontal diploic vein, which also contribute to the venous drainage. =Nerve supply= Innervation is the connection of nerves to the scalp: the sensory and motor nerves innervating the scalp. The scalp is innervated by the following: * Supratrochlear nerve and the supraorbital nerve from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve * Greater occipital nerve (C2) posteriorly up to the vertex * Lesser occipital nerve (C2) behind the ear * Zygomaticotemporal nerve from the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve supplying the hairless temple * Auriculotemporal nerve from the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve The innervation of scalp can be remembered using the mnemonic, \\"Z-GLASS\\" for, Zygomaticotemporal nerve, Greater occipital nerve, Lesser occipital nerve, Auriculotemporal nerve, Supratrochlear nerve and Supraorbital nerve. =Lymphatic drainage= Lymphatic channels from the posterior half of the scalp drain to occipital and posterior auricular nodes. Lymphatic channels from the anterior half drain to the parotid nodes. The lymph eventually reaches the submandibular and deep cervical nodes. Clinical significance =Infection= The 'danger area of the scalp' is the area of loose connective tissue. This is because pus and blood spread easily within it, and can pass into the cranial cavity along the emissary veins. Therefore infection can spread from the scalp to the meninges, which could lead to meningitis. =Hair transplantation= All the current hair transplantation techniques utilize the patient's existing hair. The aim of the surgical procedure is to use such hair as efficiently as possible. The right candidates for this type of surgery are individuals who still have healthy hair on the sides and the back of the head in order that hair for the transplant may be harvested from those areas. Different techniques are utilized in order to obtain the desired cosmetic results; factors considered may include hair color, texture, curliness, etc. The most utilized technique is the one known as micro grafting because it produces naturalistic results. It is akin to follicular unit extraction, although less advanced. A knife with multiple blades is used to remove tissue from donor areas. The removed tissue is then fragmented into smaller chunks under direct vision inspection (i.e., without a microscope). =Disease= The scalp is a common site for the development of tumours including: * Actinic keratosis * Basal-cell carcinoma * Epidermoid cyst * Merkel-cell carcinoma * Pilar cyst * Squamous cell carcinoma =Scalp conditions= * Cutis verticis gyrata ‚Äì a descriptive term for a rare deformity of the scalp * Dandruff ‚Äì A common problem caused by excessive shedding of dead skin cells from the scalp * Head lice * Seborrhoeic dermatitis ‚Äì a skin disorder causing scaly, flaky, itchy, red skin ** Cradle cap ‚Äì a form of seborrhoeic dermatitis which occurs in newborns * Tycoon's cap, also known as acne necrotica miliaris, characterized by pustules and itching Society and culture The scalp plays an important role in the aesthetics of the face. Androgenic alopecia, or male pattern hair loss, is a common cause of concern to men. It may be treated with varying rates success by medication (e.g. finasteride, minoxidil) or hair transplantation. If the scalp is heavy and loose, a common change with ageing, the forehead may be low, heavy and deeply lined. The brow lift procedure aims to address these concerns. Scalping, the act of removing the scalp, is historically associated with the American West and the Indian Wars in particular, although the practice dates back to antiquity and has developed on each continent.

The Istaevones were contrasted to neighbouring groups, the Ingaevones on the North Sea coast, and the Herminones, living inland of these groups. In linguistics, the term \\"Istvaeonic languages\\" is also sometimes used in discussions about the grouping of the northwestern West Germanic languages, consisting of Frankish and its descendants (principally Old Dutch) as well as several closely related historical dialects. Whether or not the Istvaeones spoke a Germanic language according to modern definitions, the theory proposes that their language indirectly influenced later Germanic languages in the area as a substrate.  Nomenclature  The term Istvaeonic is derived from a culturo-linguistic grouping of Germanic tribes mentioned by Tacitus, who used the spelling \\"Ist√¶uones\\" in his Germania,Tac. Ger. 2 and Pliny the Elder, who used the spelling \\"Istuaeones\\". Pliny further specified its meaning by claiming that the Ist√¶vones lived near the Rhine.Plin. Nat. 4.28 Jacob Grimm in the book Deutsche Mythologie argued that Iscaevones was the correct form, partly because it would connect the name to an ancestor figure in Norse mythology named Ask and partly because in Pseudo-Nennius where the name Mannus is corrupted as Alanus, the ancestor of the Istaevones appears as Escio or Hisicion. Pseudo-Nennius derives his information from the Frankish Table of Nations (c. 520), which names the Franks, Romans, Bretons and Alamanni as descendants of Istio, one of the three sons of Mannus. (Other spellings of this name that appear in the manuscripts include Estio, Escio, Hostius, Ostius, Hisisio, Hissitio, Hisitio, Hessitio and Scius.). Tacitus (56 CE ‚Äì ~ 120): :The Germanic tribes themselves I should regard as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. (...) In their ancient songs, their only way of remembering or recording the past, they celebrate an earth-born god, Tuisco, and his son Mannus, as the origin of their race, as their founders. To Mannus they assign three sons, from whose names, they say, the coast tribes are called Ing√¶vones; those of the interior, Herminones; all the rest, Ist√¶vones. Pliny the Elder (23 CE ‚Äì 79): :There are five German races; the Vandili, parts of whom are the Burgundiones, the Varini, the Carini, and the Gutones: the Ing√¶vones, forming a second race, a portion of whom are the Cimbri, the Teutoni, and the tribes of the Chauci. The Ist√¶vones, who join up to the Rhine [proximi autem rheno istuaeonesLatin here], and to whom the Cimbri belong [sic.], are the third race; while the Hermiones, forming a fourth, dwell in the interior, and include the Suevi, the Hermunduri, the Chatti, and the Cherusci: the fifth race is that of the Peucini, who are also the Bastern√¶, adjoining the Dacians previously mentioned. The Istvaeones (Pliny) or Istaevones (Tacitus) are therefore one of the least clearly defined of these groups, but Pliny and Tacitus and other classical sources clearly associated various tribes the Rhine frontier region, and the description of Pliny also explains that the Chatti, Cherusci and Chauci are not included in the group. In this period, between them and the Rhine, Tacitus also specifically named various tribes such as the Chamavi, Bructeri, Sugambri, Ubii and others. Also by implication the definitions above include all of the Romanized Germani Cisrhenani on the Roman side of the Rhine, because Tacitus (and before him by Julius Caesar) agreed that these peoples were related to the Germanic tribes on the other side of the Rhine. Tacitus mentions that in his time they called themselves the Tungri. He also mentions that some Rhine tribes by his time, such as the Batavi, and Cananefates, were in fact in recent immigrants, and relatives of the Chatti. Throughout the Roman era, starting already in the time of Caesar, more eastern Germanic tribes pressed the Rhine area, most famously the Chauci, Saxons and Suevians, pushing tribes into the area such as the Usipetes, Tencteri and Ampsivarii. Despite the pressures from two directions, the Chamavi and Bructeri survived in the same area until late Roman times, along with various tribes who may have been there in the time of Tacitus, or may have immigrated, such as the Salii and Chattuari (whose name suggests a connection to the Chatti). The historical sources give no complete account of the Istvaeones. Modern historians attempt to extrapolate their tribal constituents based on later sources, archeological findings and linguistic information. Istvaeones as possible ancestors to the Franks There is an overlap between Germanic tribes generally assumed to have been Istvaeonic in terms of dialect and culture, and the tribes who came later to be thought of collectively as the earliest \\"Franks\\". speculated that the Chamavi may have been the first such tribe, around which neighbours came also to be called by this name: :A Roman marching-song joyfully recorded in a fourth-century source, is associated with the 260s; but the Franks' first appearance in a contemporary source was in 289. [...] The Chamavi were mentioned as a Frankish people as early as 289, the Bructeri from 307, the Chattuarri from 306-15, the Salii or Salians from 357, and the Amsivarii and Tubantes from c. 364-75. The large \\"Irmionic\\" nation of the Chatti also seem to have been considered Franks, or allies of the Franks, at least once. In one of the last mentions of them as a separate people, Sulpicius Alexander, cited by Gregory of Tours mentions them as being led along with the Ampsivarii by the Frankish king Marcomer. The Salii were first mentioned as a Frankish tribe from north of the Rhine, from near the Chamavi. (Their origins before then are not known.) They were allowed to move into Roman territory, starting with the delta island of Batavia, and then Toxandria. In the 5th century, in the time of Flavius A√´tius they conquered as far as Tournai, despite Roman opposition, and later worked with the Romans against Attila the Hun. Further up the Rhine, the Ripuarian or Rhineland Franks (Latin Ripuarii, a name associated with the Latin word for \\"river\\") eventually had a kingdom centred upon the Roman-founded city of Cologne, on the left bank of the Rhine. The Chattuari also apparently crossed the Rhine and held lands on both sides, in an area between the Salians and Ripuarii (and possibly under the lordship of one or both of them). A separate Chamavi population possibly still existed as late as the 8th century, when it has been proposed that a Chamavi legal code was published under Charlemagne, the so- called Lex Chamavorum.Text: here, but there are doubts, see for example here. During the late 5th century, the Frankish frontier tribes and the Roman territories of Northern Gaul came to be politically united under a Frankish military leader of northern Roman Gaul, and \\"King of the Franks\\" Clovis I, and his Merovingian dynasty. This Frankish kingdom of northern Gaul published a Salian legal code applicable to the Roman region south of the original Salian territories, from the Loire in modern France to the Silva Carbonaria in modern Belgium. It grew to rule large parts of the former Western Roman Empire and Germania. At some point in the above sequence, the ethnonyms \\"Frank\\" and \\"Frankish\\" morphed into a term closer in meaning to a proto-state or political identity, rather than a tribal or ethnic designation and can no longer be considered synonymous with the Istvaeones.Werner, Karl Ferdinant: Die 'Franken'. Staat oder Volk. (1992) (However from the Merovingian period it is clear, as for example reported by Gregory of Tours, that there was a \\"Frankish language\\" distinct from the Romance languages which continued to be spoken by much of the population in what would become France.)  The Istvaeones as a linguistic grouping  The German linguist Friedrich Maurer (1898‚Äì1984), in his book \\"Nordgermanen und Alemannen\\", used the term Istvaeones to refer to a unattested proto-language, or dialectal grouping, ancestral to Old Frankish, Old Dutch and, at the very least, influenced several dialects of West Central German.Friedrich Maurer (1942) Nordgermanen und Alemannen: Studien zur germanische und fr√ºhdeutschen Sprachgeschichte, Stammes- und Volkskunde, Strasbourg: H√ºnenburg.  The Istvaeones as an archeological culture  Finds assigned to the Istvaeones are characterized by a greater heterogeneity than can be found in the other Germanic archaeological groupings. Their predominant burial type is the pyre grave. There are no richly equipped princely graves or weapons as grave goods to be found as, for example, occur with the neighboring Elbe Germanic groups.Walter Pohl: Walter Pohl: Die Germanen, Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 2004, (p. 20/21). Scholars have speculated about whether weapons were used as \\"immaterial\\" grave goods instead. In other words, weapons made of metal were placed on the pyre of a warrior, for example, but only his ashes were buried in the pyre grave. This is, however, a controversial thesis. Weapons as grave goods first appear in northern Gaul, i.e. on the Roman side of the Rhine, in burial graves, and are not found to the east of the Rhine until the Merovingian period.Sebastian Brather: Zwischen Sp√§tantike und Fr√ºhmittelalter: Arch√§ologie des 4. bis 7.

List of West Virginia rivers includes streams formally designated as rivers. There are also smaller streams (i.e., branches, creeks, drains, forks, licks, runs, etc.) in the state. Exclusive of major tributaries, there are about 46 named rivers in West Virginia. Though relatively few in number, rivers have traditionally provided easy avenues of transportation through the rough terrain of the Mountain State, first by Native Americans and later by European settlers. Even today, the larger rivers transport large volumes of commercial goods, while the smaller ones provide recreational opportunities such as canoeing, fishing, swimming, and white-water rafting.

The Esplanade East Cowes is a town and civil parish to the north of the Isle of Wight, on the east bank of the River Medina, next to its west bank neighbour Cowes. The two towns are connected by the Cowes Floating Bridge, a chain ferry operated by the Isle of Wight Council. East Cowes is the site of Norris Castle, and Osborne House, the former summer residence of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The Prince had a major influence on the architecture of the area, for example on the building of St Mildred's Church in nearby Whippingham, which features distinctive turrets imitating those found on a German castle. History The name Estcowe (East Cowes) originally comes from one of two sandbanks each side of the River Medina estuary, so-called after a supposed likeness to cows. The name was subsequently transferred to fortifications built during the reign of Henry VIII on the east bank (East Cowes Castle) to dispel a French invasion, referred to as cowforts or cowes, which subsequently gave the name to the town. The naming of Cowes was done in a similar fashion. They replaced the earlier name of Shamblord. The settlement of Shamblord at East Cowes was first recorded in 1303. It grew as East Shamblord, and became a much more significant settlement than the Western Shamblord. As the Isle of Wight was the target of frequent French invasions, with some notable incursions, the fort built at East Cowes was later destroyed and should not be confused with the \\"East Cowes Castle\\" built subsequently by John Nash. During the reign of Queen Victoria, who made her summer home at Osborne by acquiring and rebuilding Osborne House, East Cowes was the subject of planned estate of grand houses, groves and parks. The scheme, not finding the finances it needed, was folded, but a few residences built in the early stages still survive to this day such as the former Albert Grove residences of Kent House and Powys House on York Avenue. In East Cowes Norris Castle was designed in the Norman style by James Wyatt in the late eighteenth century. The building survives and today remains a private home. In 1798, the architect John Nash, began building his home, East Cowes Castle, where he later entertained the Prince Consort and other prominent guests. East Cowes Castle was notable for its Gothic towers and turrets, and elaborate castellation. Nash died in 1835 and is buried in the tower of St James' Church which he also designed. East Cowes Castle was severely damaged by bombing in World War II It was demolished during the 1960s, although the ice house remains and is visible in Sylvan Avenue. Cowes and East Cowes became a single urban district in 1933. During World War II, both Cowes and East Cowes became the targets of frequent bombing due to its industry and proximity to Southampton and the Royal Navy's home at Portsmouth. The shipyard of J. Samuel White was badly damaged by air attack in early May 1942 but, when rebuilt, innovative ship construction methods had been introduced. The first warship completed by the renewed yard was HMS Cavalier. During the air raid, the local defences had been fortuitously augmented by the Polish destroyer Blyskawica (itself built by White's), which put up such a determined defence that, in 2002, the crew's courage was honoured by a local commemoration lasting several days to mark the 60th anniversary of the event. Later in 2004, and over to the west, an area of Cowes was named Francki Place in honour of the ship's commander. To celebrate the Silver Jubilee of the Queen's coronation in 1977, the main hangar doors of what was then the British Hovercraft Corporation (a successor to Saunders Roe) were painted with the world's largest image of the Union Flag, which can still be seen today. In January 2015, the car carrier bound for Bremerhaven, Germany, ran aground on Bramble Bank after developing a heavy list, roughly five miles north of the entrance to the River Medina. It has since been re- floated, repaired, and returned to service. Transport Red Funnel car ferry Red Falcon at East Cowes ferry terminal East Cowes is linked to the mainland by Red Funnel‚Äôs vehicle ferry service. The Cowes Floating Bridge links East Cowes with Cowes throughout the day. It is a chain ferry, and is one of the few remaining not to be replaced by a physical bridge. Southern Vectis operate bus route 4 linking the town with Ryde and bus routes route 5 and 25 linking the town with Newport including intermediate villages. The Isle of Wight Coastal Path runs through East Cowes. Industry Saunders Roe East Cowes works in 1954 with Princess flying-boat Local industry in both Cowes and East Cowes has always centred on the building and design of marine craft and materials associated with boatmaking, including the early flying boats, and sailmaking. East Cowes was also once home to the aircraft manufacturer Saunders Roe, who built the large, advanced, flying boat The Saunders-Roe Princess, as well as the Black Knight rocket and the Black Arrow satellite carrier rocket. They also developed and tested the first hovercraft, the SR.N1. The former Saunders-Roe factory at Venture Quays now produces wind turbines, which can be seen laid on the quay for shipping out. Due to local objections no wind turbines have been allowed to be erected on the Isle of Wight. Sport and leisure The beach at East Cowes East Cowes has a Non- League football club East Cowes Victoria Athletic A.F.C., which plays at Beatrice Avenue. They are also home to FC Bayern Bru who play in the islands Leisure Leagues 6-a-side league at Beatrice Avenue. They won the league title in their inaugural season in the winter of 2013.

The East Cowes Redevelopment Project was set up by SEEDA https://www.iow.gov.uk/azservices/documents/2780-41-08%20Appendix%20A.pdf for the flagship project for the Cowes Waterfront Initiate, which includes redeveloping the town centre of East Cowes. It was intended that such changes would create better employment opportunities and a better environment for residents and visitors alike, providing a unique opportunity to improve East Cowes and create better investment for businesses. On 6 April 2010, work started on the new Waitrose store on Well Road on the old site of the hovercraft development building. Recruitment for jobs for the new Waitrose Store started during August/September 2010; there were 160 jobs available throughout the store and over 800 people applied. Part of the redevelopment also included the building of more houses known as \\"Victoria Walk\\" and David Wilson was chosen to be the builder. Advertising boards were placed on Old Road in East Cowes with building work commencing soon after. In 2013, work began to create a new 300 berth marina inside a new breakwater. The plan included a new hotel, restaurant and 100 new homes. During August 2012, a new Medical Centre opened at Church Path, near Waitrose. The former Medical Centre at Down House (the former home of respected local GP Dr Down), on York Avenue, was closed.Island Pulse: New medical centre to open in East Cowes Library During December 2010, under a cost-cutting plan by the Isle of Wight Council it was decided most local libraries across the Island would close in March 2011, with just Newport and Ryde remaining open. Sandown, Cowes, Ventnor & Freshwater remained opened until March 2012, during which time community groups were sought to continue the upkeep and running of the libraries. East Cowes was one of the libraries set to close in March 2011, but was saved by East Cowes Town Council who appealed for volunteers to continue running the library. It remains at the town centre premises near to the Co-op supermarket, with an outlook to move to newer premises in the near future. Whilst under the Isle of Wight Council ownership it opened around 30 hours a week; this was reduced to around 12 hours per week.

The front line was held by a large Belgian force, which halted the German advance in a costly defensive battle. The victory at the Yser allowed Belgium to retain a sliver of territory with Germany in control of 95 percent of Belgian territory, which made King Albert a Belgian national hero, sustained national pride and provided a venue for commemorations of heroic sacrifice for the next century. Background =German invasion of Belgium= On 2 August 1914, the Belgian government refused passage through Belgium to German troops and on the night of the Belgian General Staff ordered the Third Division to Li√®ge to obstruct a German advance. The German army invaded Belgium on the morning of 4 August. Covered by the Third Division, the Li√®ge fortress garrison, a screen of the Cavalry Division and detachments from Li√®ge and Namur, the Belgian field army closed up to the river Gete and by 4 August, the First Division had assembled at Tienen, the Fifth Division at Perwez, the Second Division at Leuven and the Sixth Division at Wavre, covering central and western Belgium and communications towards Antwerp. German cavalry appeared at Vis√© early on 4 August, to find the bridge down and Belgian troops on the west bank; the Germans crossed at a ford and forced the Belgians to retire towards Li√®ge. By evening, it was clear to the Belgian High Command that the Third Division and the Li√®ge garrison were in the path of a very large invasion force. With information that five German corps and six reserve corps were in Belgium and with no immediate support available from the French army and British Expeditionary Force (BEF), the Belgian field army was ordered to withdraw towards the National Redoubt on the evening of 18 August and arrived on 20 August. At an engagement between the First Division and the German IX Corps near Tienen, the Belgians suffered The Belgian government of Charles de Broqueville left Brussels for Antwerp and the Belgian capital was occupied unopposed on 20 August, as the Belgian field army completed its retreat to Antwerp. The German Siege of Namur ended with a Belgian capitulation on 24 August, as the field army made a sortie from Antwerp towards Brussels. The Germans detached the III Reserve Corps from the 1st Army to mask the city and a division of the IV Reserve Corps to occupy Brussels. On 1 October, General Hans Hartwig von Beseler ordered an attack on the Antwerp forts Sint- Katelijne-Waver, Walem and the Bosbeek and Dorpveld redoubts by the 5th Reserve and Marine divisions. By Fort Walem was severely damaged, Fort Lier had been hit by a shell, Fort Koningshooikt and the Tallabert and Bosbeek redoubts were mostly intact and the intervening ground between Fort Sint- Katelijne-Waver and Dorpveld redoubt had been captured. A counter-attack failed and the Fourth Division was reduced to The Belgian commanders ordered the left flank of the army to withdraw to a line north of the Nete, which covered the gap in the outer defences and kept the city out of range of German super-heavy artillery. Proclamations warning the inhabitants that King Albert I and the government would leave Antwerp were put up during the day. Early on 9 October, German troops found some forts of the inner ring empty; Beseler ended the bombardment and summoned the military governor, General Victor Deguise, to surrender. About 30,000 men of the Antwerp garrison surrendered and the city was occupied by German troops. About of the garrison ( of the Belgian Army) fled north to the Netherlands, where they were interned for the duration. During the siege of Antwerp, the German and French armies fought the Battle of the Frontiers and then the German armies in the north pursued the French and the BEF southwards into France in the Great Retreat, which culminated in the First Battle of the Marne followed by the First Battle of the Aisne Reciprocal attempts by the Franco-British and German armies to envelop the northern flank of the opposing army, the Race to the Sea took place through Picardy, Artois and Flanders The \\"race\\" ended on the North Sea coast of Belgium, when the last open area from Diksmuide to the North Sea was occupied by Belgian troops from Antwerp. =Allied retreat to the Yser= British and French forces in Belgium covered the withdrawal of the Belgians and British from Antwerp. The First, Third and Fourth divisions reached Ostend, the Fifth and Sixth divisions arrived at Torhout and Diksmuide and the Antwerp garrison troops moved to an area north-west of Ghent. The Germans 4th Ersatz Division and troops at Lokeren and Moerbeke turned east towards Ghent before the withdrawal was discovered. The III Reserve Corps and the 4th Division were then ordered to turn west and advance on Kortrijk, to prolong the main German front, before being sent towards Ghent and Bruges, with orders to reach Blankenberge and Ostend on the coast. On 11 October, German troops were detected advancing on Ghent, by which time the Belgian fortress troops had joined the field army. A retreat from Ghent from began, after which German troops entered the city. Several bridges were demolished during the retirement, although crowds of civilians on the main road and rail bridges led to them being left intact. By 18 October, the Belgian, British and French troops in northern France and Belgium had formed a defensive line, the British II Corps assembled with the 5th Division from La Bass√©e Canal north to Beau Puits, the 3rd Division from Illies to Aubers and three divisions of the French Cavalry Corps (General Louis Conneau) deployed from Fromelles to Le Maisnil. The British III Corps had the 6th Division from Radinghem to Epinette and the 4th Division from Epinette to Pont Rouge, the BEF Cavalry Corps with the 1st and 2nd Cavalry divisions, from De√ªl√©mont to Tenbrielen. The British IV Corps with the 7th Division and 3rd Cavalry Division from Zandvoorde to Oostnieuwkerke; the French and the de Mitry Cavalry Corps covered the ground from Roeselare (Roulers) to Kortemark (Cortemarck), the 87th and 89th Territorial divisions from Passendale (Passchendaele) to Boezinge (Boesinghe) and then the Belgian field army and fortress troops from Boezinge to Nieuwpoort. The (Rear-Admiral Pierre Alexis Ronarc'h were sent from Pierrefitte, near Paris, on 7 October, to Flanders and by 18 October were at Diksmuide (Dixmude). The comprised six battalions of mostly reservists, with 6,670 men of whom 1,450 were fusiliers, a machine-gun company (16 guns) and four machine-guns in each battalion. = Flanders terrain = Part of northern France and north Belgium from the Pas-de-Calais to the Scheldt estuary had been known as Flanders since the eleventh century. West of a line between Arras and Calais in the north of France lie chalk downlands covered with soil sufficient for arable farming, and east of the line the land declines in a series of spurs into the Flanders plain. By 1914, the plain was bounded by canals linking Douai, B√©thune, Saint-Omer and Calais. To the south-east, canals run between Lens, Lille, Roubaix and Kortrijk, the Lys river from Kortrijk to Ghent and to the north-west lies the sea. The plain is almost flat, apart from a line of low hills from Cassel, east to Mont des Cats (Katsberg), Zwarteberg (Mont Noir), Rodeberg (Mont Rouge), Scherpenberg and Kemmelberg (Mount Kemmel). From Kemmel, a low ridge lies to the north-east, declining in elevation past Ypres through Wijtschate (Wytschaete), Geluveld (Gheluvelt) and Passendale (Passchendaele), curving north then north-west to Diksmuide where it merges with the plain. A coastal strip about wide is near sea level and fringed by sand dunes. Inland the ground is mainly meadow, cut by canals, dykes, drainage ditches and roads built up on causeways. The Lys, Yser and the upper Scheldt have been canalised and between them the water level underground is close to the surface, rises further in the autumn and fills any dip, the sides of which then collapse. The ground surface quickly turns to a consistency of cream cheese and on the coast troop movements were confined to roads, except during frosts. The rest of the Flanders Plain is woods and small fields, divided by hedgerows planted with trees and cultivated from small villages and farms. The terrain was difficult for infantry operations because of the lack of observation, impossible for mounted action because of the many obstructions and difficult for artillery because of the limited view. South of La Bass√©e Canal around Lens and B√©thune was a coal- mining district full of slag heaps, pit heads () and miners' houses (). North of the canal, the cities of Lille, Tourcoing and Roubaix form a manufacturing complex, with outlying industries at Armenti√®res, Comines, Halluin and Menen, along the Lys river, with isolated sugar beet and alcohol refineries and a steel works near Aire-sur-la-Lys. Intervening areas are agricultural, with wide roads on shallow foundations, unpaved mud tracks in France and narrow pav√© roads along the frontier and in Belgium. In France, the roads were closed by the local authorities during thaws to preserve the surface and marked by , which in 1914 were ignored by British lorry drivers. The difficulty of movement after the end of summer absorbed much of the civilian labour available on road maintenance, leaving field defences to be built by front- line soldiers. Prelude The Belgian retreat continued on covered by cavalry, cyclists and motor machine-gun sections. On 14 October, the Belgian army began to dig in along the Yser, the Sixth and Fifth divisions to the north of French territorial divisions, assembled at Boezinge, then northwards along the Yser canal to the at Diksmuide (Dixmude). The Fourth, First and Second divisions prolonged the line north, with advanced posts at Beerst, Keiem (Keyem), Schoore and Mannekensvere, about forward on the east bank. A bridgehead was also held near the coast around Lombartzyde and Westende, to cover Nieuwpoort (Nieuport), with the 2nd Cavalry Division in reserve. On 18 October, the French 87th and 89th Territorial divisions took over the defence of the front line south of Fort Knokke from the Sixth Division, which was moved to the Yser Front. On 21 October, the hard-pressed Belgian Army was reinforced by the French 42nd Division (Major-General Paul Fran√ßois Grossetti). The Allies assembled a naval force under the British Admiral Horace Hood with three monitors, , , and assorted craft to provide heavy artillery support to the defenders of the seaward flank. The German forces comprised the new 4th Army (Albrecht Duke of W√ºrttemberg), with the III Reserve Corps from Antwerp and four new reserve corps from Germany, along with cavalry and heavy artillery units. It moved southwards from Bruges and Ostend in the direction of the Yser river, to take the line from Nieuwpoort to Ypres (Ieper). Battle On 16 October Diksmuide, garrisoned by Belgian and French troops under Colonel Alphonse Jacques, was attacked. Despite many casualties, the Belgians and French held the town. The press, politicians, literary figures and the military channelled public opinion, making out that the defence of the town was both strategic and heroic. On 18 October, the German offensive began and overran Allied troops from Nieuwpoort southwards to Arras. The objective was to defeat the Belgian and French armies and to deprive the British of access to Calais, Boulogne and Dunkirk. The III Reserve Corps attacked Belgian defences from Diksmuide to the sea, regardless of loss. The Germans captured advanced posts at Keiem, Schoore and part of Mannekensvere and reached the Yser, despite bombardments from the Anglo-French flotilla, which engaged German troops along the coast as far as Middelkerke. The 4th Ersatz Division was forbidden to cross the Yser at Nieuwpoort because of the shell-fire from the Allied ships. On 21 October, the Germans established a small bridgehead on the west bank, despite a counter-attack by the French 42nd Division, which had just arrived and the last bridge was blown on 23 October. Diksmuide was constantly bombarded and attacked but the defenders managed to hold on. The , the French high command, planned to flood the land to obstruct the Germans, which would trap the Belgian army between the flood and the Germans or force them to abandon the last part of unoccupied Belgium. The plan was postponed because the Belgian army was preparing to flood the area between the Yser and its tributary canals. On 25 October, the German pressure on the Belgians was so great that a decision was taken to inundate the Belgian front line. After an abortive attempt on 21 October, the Belgians managed to open the sluices at Nieuwpoort during the nights of 26‚Äì30 October, during high tides, steadily raising the water level until an impassable flooded area was created of about wide, stretching as far south as Diksmuide. The Germans attacked again on the Yser front on 30 October, overran the Belgian second line and reached Ramskapelle and Pervijze. Belgian and French counter-attacks recovered Ramskapelle and the final attack, planned for the next day was called off when the Germans realised that the land behind them was flooding. The Germans withdrew in the night of 30‚Äì31 October. On 10 November, Diksmuide fell and the fighting continued further south until 22 November, in the First Battle of Ypres. Aftermath The Belgian Army and its allies had managed to hold the last corner of Belgium, ending the Race to the Sea and the period of open warfare. The front line along the Yser River became known as the Yser Front and was held by the Belgian Army until 1918. James Edward Edmonds wrote in 1925, in the History of the Great War, that from 18 October to 30 November 1914, between Gheluvelt and the coast, the Germans suffered an estimated 76,250 casualties. In 2010, Jack Sheldon wrote that from 18 to 30 October, the Belgian army sustained 20,000 casualties and that German casualties may have been much greater. The struggle of the Belgian army to hold on to its territory during the remainder of the war and the experiences of ordinary Flemish infantrymen, led to an increase in Flemish national sentiment and the foundation of the , the first party of the Flemish Movement, in 1917.

She represented a succession of liberal and centre-left opposition parties during her 36-year tenure in the whites-only, National Party-controlled House of Assembly of South Africa at the height of the apartheid era. She hosted the meeting that founded the Progressive Party in 1959, and was its only MP in the 160-member House for a period of 13 years. During that 13-year period she was the only Member of the South African Parliament consistently and unequivocally to oppose all apartheid legislation. Suzman was instrumental in improving prison conditions for members of the banned African National Congress including Nelson Mandela, despite her reservations about Mandela's revolutionary policies, and was also known for using her parliamentary privilege to evade government censorship and pass information to the media about the worst abuses of apartheid. She was twice nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Early life and education Suzman was born Helen Gavronsky in 1917 to Frieda and Samuel Gavronsky, Jewish Lithuanian immigrants. She was born in Germiston, then a small mining town outside Johannesburg. Her mother died shortly after she was born. Suzman matriculated in 1933 from Parktown Convent, Johannesburg. She studied for a Bachelors in Commerce at Witwatersrand University. At age 19, she married Dr Moses Suzman (died 1994), who was 33 and an eminent physician; the couple had two daughters. She returned to university in 1941 to complete a degree in economics and economic history. After completing her degree she spent the rest of the war working for the Governor General's War Fund and as a statistician at the War Supply board. In 1945, she became a tutor and later lecturer in economic history at Witwatersrand University. Career As a member of the South African Institute of Race Relations, she was involved in preparing evidence for the Fagan Commission's inquiry into laws applying to Africans in urban areas and into the system of migrant labour. She attributed this experience to her first real awareness of the hardship and difficulties experienced by Africans seeking work in urban areas. =Political activism= She was elected to the House of Assembly in 1953 as a member of the United Party for the Houghton constituency in Johannesburg. The United Party caucus supported the second reading of the 1953 Separate Amenities Bill that provided for separate (and effectively unequal) facilities for Blacks, Coloureds, Indians and Whites. When the vote was taken, Helen Suzman and one other UP member refused to vote and walked out of the House. Dissatisfied with the supine stance of United Party to the apartheid policies of the Government, Suzman and eleven other liberal members of the United Party broke away to form the Progressive Party in 1959. The party rejected race discrimination and advocated equal opportunities for all with a qualified franchise with a common voter's roll. Suzman with the breakaway Progressive Party's House caucus in 1960, prior to the disastrous 1961 election. At the 1961 general election all the other Progressive MPs lost their seats, leaving Suzman as the sole parliamentarian unequivocally opposed to apartheid for 13 years from 1961 to 1974.In No Uncertain Terms, Memoirs Helen Suzman Jonathan Ball Publishers Suzman herself retained her seat by a margin of just 564 votes. =The solo years: 1961‚Äì1974= After the 1961 election Prime Minister Hendrik F. Verwoerd announced in Parliament that he had never believed the Progressive Party would be a threat and, turning towards Suzman, said \\"I have written you off\\". Suzman replied \\"And the whole world has written you off\\". As the sole representative of her party in Parliament, she sought to do the work of an opposition party single handed. In her first session she made 66 speeches, moved 26 amendments and put 137 questions. Most of her questions concerned treatment of Black, Coloured and Indian people ‚Äì on issues such as housing, education, forced removals, Pass Law offences, detentions, bannings, whippings, police brutality and execution. Mandela later wrote: \\"She was undoubtedly the only real anti- apartheid voice in parliament and the discourtesy of the Nat MPs towards her showed how they felt her punches and how deeply they resented her presence.\\" For two more general elections (1966 and 1970), she was again the sole member returned for her party to Parliament. As a result, for 13 years, she dined alone in Parliament with no other MP to discuss tactics or approach. Often, as apartheid legislation was introduced, she would call a division of the house, a process whereby the members of the Parliament had physically to stand up and be counted. On many such occasions, as when opposing the infamous 90-day detention law, she found herself alone at one side of the Parliamentary chamber and all other MPs at the other side. An eloquent public speaker with a sharp and witty manner, Suzman was noted for her strong public criticism of the governing National Party's policies of apartheid at a time when this was atypical of white South Africans. She found herself even more of an outsider because she was an English-speaking Jewish woman in a parliament dominated by Calvinist Afrikaner men. In her 13 years as the sole member of her party in the South African Parliament, Suzman made 885 speeches on almost every conceivable subject and posed 2,262 questions. In a period in which there were numerous laws passed imposing censorship on the press, parliamentary privilege ensured that her exchanges in Parliament could be published. She was once accused by a minister of asking questions in parliament that embarrassed South Africa, to which she replied: \\"It is not my questions that embarrass South Africa; it is your answers.\\" On one occasion, Prime Minister Verwoerd announced in Parliament to her: 'You are of no account. Your days in Parliament are numbered.' Suzman replied: 'Why? Are you going to put me under house arrest or put me on Robben Island?' Suzman was resolute in her opposition to all forms of racial discrimination. Early in her career, a white woman said at a caucus meeting, \\"Well, I don't know about Mrs Suzman, but when I go to a museum, I don't like it if some strange black man rubs himself up against me\\". Suzman retorted: \\"Don't you mind it if some strange white man rubs himself up against you?\\" Later in her career, she mused in Parliament: \\"I do not know why we equate‚Äîand with such examples before us‚Äîa white skin with civilisation\\". = Abuse and Suzman's responses = Suzman was subject to anti-semitic and misogynist abuse by Nationalist MPs in Parliament and out. Frequent comments were made to her in Parliament such as \\"We don't like your screeching Jewish voice\\" or \\"Go back to Israel!\\". One nationalist MP, Piet Koornhof, said to her in Parliament: \\"If I should come home one evening and my wife should rant and rave the way the hon. member for Houghton did this afternoon, there would be only one of two things that one could do to her... I think she deserves a good hiding\\". In May 1965 P.W. Botha (then Minister of Coloured Affairs) remarked: ‚ÄòThe Honourable Member for Houghton... is in the habit of chattering continually. If my wife chattered like that Honourable Member, I would know what to do with her. There is nothing that works on my nerves more than a woman who continually interrupts me. She is like water dripping on a tin roof.‚Äô In 1986, she had the following exchange with then Prime Minister Botha: \\"Helen Suzman: Stupid! P.W. Botha: Woman!\\" When Prime Minister Verwoerd was assassinated in the Parliamentary chamber in 1966, P.W. Botha, then minister of Defence, had accused Suzman of being responsible, saying: \\"It's you! You liberals did this! Now we'll get you!\\" She demanded, and eventually received a formal apology, but the enmity between the two remained. In the early 1980s, she had stayed to observe police dismantle shacks in a black settlement and take the occupants to jail. P.W. Botha warned in Parliament that her conduct was bordering on illegal and said \\"I am telling you that if you try to break the law you will see what happens\\". Suzman responded: \\"the prime minister has been trying to bully me for twenty-eight years and he has not succeeded yet. I am not frightened of you. I never have been and I never will be. I think nothing of you.\\" On one occasion, P.W. Botha said \\"The Hon. Member for Houghton, it is well known, does not like me\\". Suzman interjected: ‚ÄòLike you? I can‚Äôt stand you!‚Äô She was often harassed by the police and her phone was tapped by them. She listed her name in the phone book and often received phone calls with obscene, racist and threatening messages. She had a special technique for dealing with such calls, which was to blow a shrill whistle into the mouthpiece of the phone. Marie van Zyl, of the Kappie Kommando (An ultra-conservative Afrikaner women‚Äôs political organization), wrote to Suzman protesting the latter's support for \\"heathens\\" and boasting that her own people, the Voortrekkers, had brought the Bible over the mountains to the interior to the blacks. She asked what Suzman's people had done. Suzman replied: ‚ÄúYou say your people brought the Bible over the mountains and ask what mine did. They wrote it, my dear ‚Ä¶‚Äù In February 1974 LJC Botha, Nationalist MP for Rustenburg remarked: ‚ÄòWhen she gets up in this House, she reminds me of a cricket in a thorn tree when it is very dry in the bushveld. His chirping makes you deaf but the tune remains the same year in and year out. In her fight for the Bantu, the honourable member... sings the same tune for year after year.‚Äô She famously advised John Vorster, Prime Minister 1966‚Äì1978, to some day visit a township, \\"in heavy disguise as a human being\\". When a minister complained of the murder rate in his constituency, she advised him not to go there \\"or it will rise by one\\". = Parliamentary career: 1974‚Äì1989 = Later, as parliamentary white opposition to apartheid grew, the Progressive Party gained a further 6 seats (in 1974) and Suzman was joined in parliament by notable liberal colleagues such as Colin Eglin. The party then merged in 1975 with Harry Schwarz's Reform Party and became the Progressive Reform Party. It was renamed the Progressive Federal Party when further MPs from the reformist wing of the United Party joined in 1977 and the party became the official opposition. She spent a total of 36 years in parliament. After the 1976 Soweto shootings, MP Dr HMJ van Rensburg said: \\"It is a pity you were not one of them, Helen\\" and another called her \\"a saboteur of the police\\". Suzman herself said: \\"Every Nationalist MP should go to at least one funeral for unrest victims heavily disguised as human beings, instead of sitting on their green benches in parliament, insulated like fish in an aquarium.\\" In 1982, following Neil Aggett's death, she read out in Parliament a letter smuggled out of prison concerning Aggett's torture at the hands of the security police.http://www.702.co.za/articles/372563/neil-aggett-s-sister-disturbed-by- testimonies-about-his-torture In 1986, there was the following exchange in Parliament when Minister of Law and Order Le Grange asked \\"Who is the hon Member for Houghton's No 1 man in South Africa? It is Nelson Mandela\\" Mrs Suzman responded: \\"Let him go!\\" Le Grange continued: \\"She admires him with everything she has. He is the only man who according to her can counter act the present unrest situation in South Africa and negotiate on peace\\". Mrs Suzman interjected: \\"That's right!\\" = Extra parliamentary activity = Suzman's motto was to \\"go and see for yourself\\". She was a frequent visitor to prisons to protect prisoners from warder brutality and campaigned for improved prison conditions. She visited Nelson Mandela on numerous occasions while he was in prison and made representations to the authorities to improve his conditions and those of other prisoners on Robben Island. In his autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom, Mandela wrote: ‚ÄúIt was an odd and wonderful sight to see this courageous woman peering into our cells and strolling around our courtyard. She was the first and only woman ever to grace our cells\\". Many of the prisoners, including Neville Alexander and Mandela himself, attributed improvements to their conditions, in part, to her visits: In his autobiography, Mandela attributes the removal of the sadistic warder Van Rensberg (aka \\"Suitcase\\") to Suzman's visit and her subsequent representations to the authorities and in Parliament. Andrew Mlangeni, a senior ANC member who was with Mandela on Robben Island with Mandela, described how \\"[w]henever our treatment in prison tended to improve a little bit, we knew that Suzman was on her way.We would get things such as books that you perhaps ordered more than six months ago.They would give you your books if you were studying, because those were some of the things we raised on Robben Island.You would have to wait for months before you could get books prescribed by the University of South Africa and other institutions, but as soon as you got them, you knew that Suzman was on her way to see the conditions under which we were living, to see how best she could help us. Only a person such as Suzman could help us.The International Red Cross also used to visit us on Robben Island, but they couldn‚Äôt do as much as Suzman. Suzman was not afraid to go to Pretoria to the commissioner and raise these issues personally, to say that these were the conditions under which people were living, please bring about some improvement. She was a fearless lady.\\"https://hsf.org.za/publications/focus/focus-53 p.31 She visited Robert Sobukwe when he was in virtual solitary confinement for 6 years and repeatedly sought his release in Parliament. During one debate in Parliament in which Suzman raised the conditions of Sobukwe's imprisonment without trial in a compound in Robben Island, Nationalist MP GPC Bezuidenhout asked: ‚ÄúWhy do you say that he is living in a compound? Is it not a flat?‚ÄùMrs Suzman answered:‚ÄúI wonder whether the hon member who is so cynical about this would care to take up permanent residence in that flat. Perhaps he will enjoy it.‚Äùhttps://hsf.org.za/publications/focus/focus-53 p.28 She attended the militant ‚Äì and often dangerous ‚Äì funerals of activists whenever invited to do so in the belief that her presence could prevent police brutality She visited resettlement areas, townships and squatter camps, observing conditions and giving assistance to individuals where she could. She used these visits to arm herself with evidence from on the spot investigations \\"to challenge forcefully the government and bear personal witness to the suffering inflicted on millions of South Africans\\" She visited banned persons, such as Albert Luthuli, Winnie Mandela and Mamphela Ramphele, and made effective representations on their behalf. In 1963, Albert Luthuli, then President of the ANC, wrote to Helen Suzman and expressed his \\"deep appreciation and admiration for your heroic and lone stand against a most reactionary Parliament...I most heartily congratulate you for your untiring efforts in a situation that would frustrate and benumb many... For ever remember, you are a bright Star in a dark Chamber...Not only ourselves ‚Äì your contemporaries, but also posterity, will hold you in high esteem\\". Suzman was inundated with requests for assistance from individuals harmed by the apartheid laws and bureaucracy. She regarded herself as the \\"honorary ombudsman of the dispossessed\\" and sought tirelessly to make representations on their behalf to the relevant authorities. Nadine Gordimer commented: \\"[But over the years I have observed ‚Äì that when people are in trouble, she has been the one they have appealed to. She is the one everyone trusted]‚Ä¶Suzman never refused anyone her help, that I knew of. No matter how unpleasant or hostile the individual's attitude to her and her political convictions had been.\\" =Other issues= Although principally concerned with issues of race discrimination, Suzman was also concerned with other issues including women's rights. Her maiden speech was on the 1953 Matrimonial Affairs Bill. Women's rights (and in particular those of Black women) became part of the larger fight for human rights. She campaigned against gender discrimination, particularly as it affected African women whose status in customary law was that of \\"perpetual minors.\\" In 1988 she was instrumental in having matrimonial legislation enacted that greatly improved the legal status of women. She fought for equal matrimonial property rights for Black women, divorce by consent and the reform of abortion laws. She was opposed to the death penalty and campaigned against its reintroduction. In 1971, she was the only member of Parliament who voted against what she described as \\"the harshest drugs law in the world\\" that laid down a mandatory 2-year sentence of imprisonment for possession of cannabis and a mandatory 5-year sentence of imprisonment for possession of more than 115g of cannabis. She supported the decriminalisation of marijuana use long before it was fashionable, stating publicly that possession of marijuana/cannabis (or dagga, as it is known in South Africa) for personal use should not be a criminal offence. = Post Parliamentary career: 1989‚Äì2009 = She was appointed by Mandela to the first electoral commission of South Africa that oversaw the first election based on universal franchise in 1994. She was chairwoman of the Vaal Reef Disaster Fund for three years, appointed to look after the widows and children of the 104 men killed in the Vaal Reef mining disaster of 10 May 1995. She was president of the South African Institute of Race Relations, one of the premier research institutions in SA. She served as a member of the Human Rights Commission from 1995 to 1998 She was present with Mandela when he signed the new constitution in 1996. Speaking in 2004 at the age of 86, Suzman confessed that she was disappointed by the African National Congress. Suzman stated: \\"I had hoped for something much better... [t]he poor in this country have not benefited at all from the ANC. This government spends 'like a drunken sailor'. Instead of investing in projects to give people jobs, they spend millions buying weapons and private jets, and sending gifts to Haiti.\\" Referring to South Africa's relations with Zimbabwe, whose president Robert Mugabe had in 2001 declared Suzman an \\"enemy of the state\\", she said: \\"Mugabe has destroyed that country while South Africa has stood by and done nothing. The way Mugabe was feted at the inauguration last month was an embarrassing disgrace. But it served well to illustrate very clearly Mbeki's point of view.\\" Suzman also stated her distrust of the racial politics of Mbeki: \\"Don't think for a moment that Mbeki is not anti-white ‚Äì he is, most definitely. His speeches all have anti-white themes and he continues to convince everyone that there are two types of South African ‚Äì the poor black and the rich white.\\" Perhaps conscious that she might be misconstrued, Suzman added: \\"For all my criticisms of the current system, it doesn't mean that I would like to return to the old one. I don't think we will ever go the way of Zimbabwe, but people are entitled to be concerned. I am hopeful about any future for whites in this country ‚Äì but not entirely optimistic.\\" Recognition and legacy Western Boulevard in Cape Town was renamed Helen Suzman Boulevard in 2011. While working from within the system, she earned the respect of Nelson Mandela, who praised her courage and credited her with helping to alleviate conditions of incarceration. Always outspoken and independent, she spoke out against the regime but at times opposed Mandela's policies. She opposed economic sanctions as counter productive and harmful to poor blacks. After Mandela's release \\"she was prominent among those ... who persuaded him to drop the ANC's revolutionary program in favour of an evolutionary one, retaining a market economy and a parliamentary democracy.\\" She continued to be a critic after the fall of Apartheid. She was critical of Mandela when he praised dictator Muammar Qaddafi as a supporter of human rights. According to her biographer, Lord Robin Renwick, before and after the ANC came to power she continued to speak out against those in power who would \\"put party and state above the individual whether black or white\\". Mandela wrote a message to Suzman on her 85th Birthday, stating \\"Your courage, integrity and principled commitment to justice have marked you as one of the outstanding figures in the history of public life in South Africa. On your 85th birthday we can but pay tribute to you, thank you and let you know how fortunate our country feels for having had you as part of its public life and politics.\\" Mandela added: \\"Now, looking back from the safety of our non-racial democracy, we can even feel some sympathy for the National Party members who shared Parliament with you. Knowing what a thorn in the flesh of even your friends and political allies you can be, your forthright fearlessness must have made life hell for them when confronted by you.\\" Some in the ANC and SACP were critical of her method of opposition to Apartheid. She was denounced as an agent of colonialism and \\"part of the system\\" as well as for her failure to back sanctions. Mandela remained an admirer, saying \\"the consistency with which you defended the basic values of freedom and the rule of law over the last three decades has earned you the admiration of many South Africans.\\" So did many others in the anti-apartheid movement, including Winnie Mandela. Suzman was awarded 27 honorary doctorates from universities around the world, including from Harvard, Yale, Oxford and Cambridge. She was twice nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize and received numerous other awards from religious and human rights organisations around the world. Former Queen of South Africa, Elizabeth II made her an honorary Dame Commander (Civil Division) of the Order of the British Empire in 1989. She was awarded the Order of Merit (Gold) by Nelson Mandela in 1997. She was voted No. 24 in the Top 100 Great South Africans TV series. She was awarded the Freedom of the City of Kingston upon Hull in 1987. The country of Liberia issued a postage stamp to honour Suzman in March 2011, calling her one of the Legendary heroes of Africa. In November 2017, the South African Post Office announced that it \\"has honoured this great, brave and pioneering woman with a rare gesture of a postage stamp\\" as an \\"indication of her importance to the country and to the liberation thereof and to that of women\\". The Progressive Federal Party of which Suzman was the sole Parliamentary representative between 1961 and 1973 became the Democratic Party after merging with the National Democratic Movement and the Independent Party in 1989. The Democratic Party was renamed the Democratic Alliance (DA) in 2000. The DA is currently the official opposition party of South Africa, under the interim leadership of John Steenhuisen. In November 2017, former DA leader Mmusi Maimane paid tribute to Suzman, noting that \\"Every value we call our own in the DA can be traced back to the principles Helen fought for over her 36-year-long career as a Member of Parliament\\". The Helen Suzman Foundation was founded in 1993 to honour the life work of Helen Suzman. The Foundation seeks to promote the values espoused by Helen Suzman throughout her public life and in her devotion to public service. Death Suzman died in her sleep, of natural causes on 1 January 2009. She was 91 years old. Achmat Dangor, Nelson Mandela Foundation chief executive, said Suzman was a \\"great patriot and a fearless fighter against apartheid\\". Flags in South Africa were ordered to fly at half mast in her honour.

The siege lasted for 29 months from 8 September 1941, to 27 January 1944. Over one million citizens of Leningrad died from starvation, stress, exposure and bombardments. Each winter, the Lake Ladoga ice route was reconstructed by hand, and built according to precise arithmetic calculations depending on traffic volume. In addition to transporting thousands of tons of munitions and food supplies each year, the Road of Life also served as the primary evacuation route for the millions of Soviets trapped within the starving city. The road today forms part of the World Heritage Site. Establishment US propaganda film showing the Road of Life. By 8 September 1941, the German Army Group North under Feldmarschall Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb had almost completely surrounded Leningrad, successfully cutting off all major supply routes. To address this growing concern, a decision was cast by the Military Soviet of the Leningrad Front to establish an evacuation commission in November 1941. As the severity of the siege intensified, the committee proposed the construction of an ice road over Lake Ladoga as both a viable supply line and means for civilian evacuation en masse. The Road of Life began to operate on 19 November 1941 after Captain Mikhail Murov and his transport regiment carried the first supplies over Lake Ladoga via horse-drawn sleigh. However, due to proximal bombardments, ice breakage, and unreliable machinery, the route was far from fully functional at this time. It was only in mid-December, after troops of the Volkhov front recaptured Tikhvin, that construction of a railroad directly connecting the western shore of Lake Ladoga to Leningrad was possible. Shortly thereafter, the ice road began receiving truck traffic, despite frequent breaks in the early stages of the ice. The route was so dangerous, that in the first week of truck operation alone, more than forty supply trucks had fallen through the ice and sunk to the bottom of the lakea depth of at its deepest point. After sustaining massive initial supply losses in November and December, the Road of Life slowly began to show signs of improvement by January and February 1942, thanks to the completion of a rail line connecting the ice road to Voibokalo. During the winter of 1941‚Äì42 the ice corridor of the Road of Life operated for 152 days, until 24 April. About 514,000 city inhabitants, 35,000 wounded soldiers, industrial equipment from 86 plants and factories, and also some art and museum collections were evacuated from Leningrad during the first winter of the blockade. While the road was protected by anti-aircraft artillery on the ice and fighter planes in the air, truck convoys were persistently attacked by German artillery and airplanes, making travel dangerous. The total number of people evacuated from the siege of Leningrad through the Road of Life was about 1.3 million, mostly women and children. During 1942 the \\"Artery of Life\\", a long oil pipeline via Lake Ladoga was built of which ran under water at a depth of . The steam locomotive at Petrokrepost railway station established in memory of a railwayman of the Road of Life During the following winter of 1942‚Äì1943, the Road of Life began to operate once again,Great Soviet Encyclopedia. starting with horse traffic on 20 December 1942. Motor vehicles began to operate on 24 December 1942. Construction of the long railway over piles and ice also began in December 1942. Operation Spark, a full-scale offensive of troops of the Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts, started in the morning of 12 January 1943. After heavy and fierce battles, the Red Army units overcame the powerful German fortified zones to the south of Lake Ladoga, and on 18 January 1943 the two fronts met, opening a land corridor to the besieged city. In few weeks, a direct railroad line to Shlisselburg was constructed to bring supplies to Leningrad. The city of Leningrad was still subject to at least a partial siege, as well as air and artillery bombardment, until a Soviet offensive broke through the German lines, lifting the siege on 27 January 1944. For the heroic resistance of its citizens, Leningrad was the first city awarded the honorary title of Hero City in 1945.  Construction  Road of life in November‚ÄìDecember 1941 Measuring in length and wide, Lake Ladoga (or Lake Nevo as it was called in ancient times) is one of Europe‚Äôs largest lakes of its kind. Due to its size and unpredictable weather conditions, many speculated that the construction of an ice road connecting its shores would be impossible. Although the Russians had previous historical experience in ice road construction (an ice railroad had been laid over the Kola River near Murmansk during World War I, and another over a portion of Lake Baikal during the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway), none of their prior endeavors were as complicated or as urgent as the Ladoga supply route. Even during winter, the region's erratic winds were capable of increasing or decreasing the lake's water level by as much as within just a few hours. A team of engineers was quickly assembled to ensure that the proposed route would be structurally sound; one Leningrad scientist noted: \\"At , of ice would form in 64 hours; at , 4 inches would form in 34 hours, at , 4 inches in 23 hours. A foot of ice [30 cm] would be laid down in 24 days at . It would take 8 days to create a foot of ice at . Additionally: *A minimum of of ice was necessary to support a horse without cargo. *A minimum of of ice was necessary to support a horse-drawn sleigh with one ton of cargo. *A minimum of of ice was necessary to support a truck transporting one ton of cargo. Although only a foot of ice was required to support mass transit along the route, the actual thickness of the ice typically ranged from , a density thick enough for nearly any task. Once the route had been confirmed and tested for stability, larger plows and snow carving machines were then used to widen the ice road and make it more suitable for automobile transport. By February 1942, large snow banks on either side of the route had been made into massive ice walls, which shielded transport from the lake's harsh winds. At each kilometer, a traffic guard flagged the convoy onward, and warned of obstructions or accidents ahead. As the ice melted in the spring, the ice road was dissolved and replaced with a flotilla system that continued to ferry goods across the massive lake. As soon as the ice hardened, the Road of Life was reconstructed again in December 1942.Salisbury, Harrison E. The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad. New York: Harper & Row Incorporated, 1969. pp. 512-516. Since February 1943 the road became superseded by the land corridor, but ice traffic continued until March 30.  Volume of transported goods  The Road of Life was used to transport the following supplies: *November 1941: approximately 1,500 tons of food (primarily flour) *January 1942: approximately 52,000 tons of various supplies (of which ~42,000 tons were food) *February 1942: approximately 86,000 tons of various supplies (of which ~67,000 tons were food) *March 1942: approximately 113,000 tons of various supplies (of which ~87,000 tons were food) *April 1942: approximately 87,000 tons of various supplies (of which ~57,000 tons were food) In total the ice road was used to ship more than 360,000 tons of goods, mostly rations and fodder, into Leningrad. In the first winter of the siege the ice road operated until 23 April 1942. From November 1941 to April 1942, the Road of Life had delivered more than 350,000 tons of freight to Leningrad, and of this total, more than 75% of all shipments made were food supplies used to feed the city‚Äôs starving inhabitants. Other supplies of vital importance included gasoline, engine lubricants, and ammunition, used to resupply the few military units still stationed inside the besieged city. Around 32,000 tons of military supplies and more than 37,000 tons of fuels and lubricants destined for the front and naval fleet were shipped out of Leningrad via the Road of Life. On 23 April 1942, three cars carrying onions crossed the nearly melted route, delivering the last supplies to reach Leningrad via ice road that year.  After the siege  In the summer, with the start of the navigable period, deliveries to the city continued thanks to the Ladoga Military Flotilla. In 1943 the Road of Life was replaced by the Road of Victory ‚Äì a railway, laid on the narrow path conquered during operation Iskra from Leningrad to Volkhov. Now the Road of Life, within the limits of Saint Petersburg, is often referred to as Ryabovskoe Highway, but within Vsevolozhsk, the Road of Life is the official name.  Monuments and memorials  In total there are seven monuments along the Road of Life, 46 memorial poles along the road, and 56 memorial poles along the railway.

He made appearances in many television programmes, including a portrayal of Imperial Japanese Army Major Yamauchi in the British drama series Tenko and as Entwistle in Last of the Summer Wine. Early life Kwouk was born in Warrington,England & Wales, Birth Index, 1916‚Äì2005: Registration district: Manchester South; Inferred County: Cheshire; Volume Number: 8d; Page Number: 40 Lancashire, but was brought up in Shanghai. Between the ages of 12 and 16 he attended the Jesuit Mission School there, which he described as \\"the Far East equivalent of Eton\\". He left China in 1947 when his Chinese parents returned to Britain and was then sent to the United States to complete his education. In 1953 he graduated from Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. The Kwouk family fortune had been lost in the 1949 revolution and in 1954 he returned to Britain, where a girlfriend \\"nagged [him] into acting\\". Career Kwouk made his film debut in the film Windom's Way (1957). One of his earliest film roles was in The Inn of the Sixth Happiness (1958) in the role of the leader of a prison revolt who later aids the main character Gladys Aylward (Ingrid Bergman) in heroically leading orphans to safety. He was best known for playing Cato Fong, Inspector Clouseau's manservant, in the Pink Panther film series. The character was first introduced in A Shot in the Dark (1964), the second film in the series, and was a role that Kwouk would reprise on another six occasions until the 2006 series reboot. The running gag was that Cato was ordered to attack Clouseau when he least expected it to keep him alert, usually resulting in a ruined romantic encounter or Clouseau's flat being completely destroyed. Amid the chaos, the phone would ring and Cato would calmly answer it before dutifully handing the phone to his employer and being thumped by Clouseau. He was a stalwart of several 1960s ITC television series, such as Danger Man, The Saint and Man of the World, when an oriental character was required. Kwouk featured as one of the leads in the short-lived series The Sentimental Agent (1963) and had minor roles in three James Bond films. In Goldfinger (1964) he played Mr. Ling, a Chinese expert in nuclear fission; in the non-Eon spoof Casino Royale (1967) he played a general and in You Only Live Twice (also 1967) Kwouk played the part of a Japanese operative of Blofeld credited as Spectre 3. Burt Kwouk at IMDB He appeared with Laurence Olivier and Anthony Quinn in The Shoes of the Fisherman (1968). A reference to Kwouk's appearances in several films with Peter Sellers is found in the opening scene of The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu (1980) where Sellers says to him \\"your face is familiar.\\" His next major role was as the honourable but misguided Major Yamauchi in the World War II television drama Tenko (1981‚Äì84). Kwouk featured in many British television productions that called for an east Asian actor. As a result, he became a familiar face in the United Kingdom and appeared as himself in the Harry Hill Show as well as several of Hill's live tours. In 2000, he appeared in an episode of the syndicated western TV series Queen of Swords as Master Kiyomasa, an aged Japanese warrior-priest. Sung-Hi Lee played his female pupil, Kami. He provided voice-overs on the spoof Japanese betting show Banzai (2001‚Äì04) and subsequently appeared in adverts for the betting company, Bet365. From 2002 to the series's end in 2010, he had a regular role as one of the three main characters in the long-running series Last of the Summer Wine, as 'Electrical' Entwistle. His later work also included voice acting for radio drama, video games, and television commercials. Burt also had a cameo in Super Gran in 1985.

The virtual dedicated server (VDS) also has a similar meaning. A VPS runs its own copy of an operating system (OS), and customers may have superuser-level access to that operating system instance, so they can install almost any software that runs on that OS. For many purposes they are functionally equivalent to a dedicated physical server, and being software-defined, are able to be much more easily created and configured. They are priced much lower than an equivalent physical server. However, as they share the underlying physical hardware with other VPSes, performance may be lower, depending on the workload of any other executing virtual machines.  Virtualization  The force driving server virtualization is similar to that which led to the development of time-sharing and multiprogramming in the past. Although the resources are still shared, as under the time-sharing model, virtualization provides a higher level of security, dependent on the type of virtualization used, as the individual virtual servers are mostly isolated from each other and may run their own full-fledged operating system which can be independently rebooted as a virtual instance. Partitioning a single server to appear as multiple servers has been increasingly common on microcomputers since the launch of VMware ESX Server in 2001. The physical server typically runs a hypervisor which is tasked with creating, releasing, and managing the resources of \\"guest\\" operating systems, or virtual machines. These guest operating systems are allocated a share of resources of the physical server, typically in a manner in which the guest is not aware of any other physical resources save for those allocated to it by the hypervisor. As a VPS runs its own copy of its operating system, customers have superuser-level access to that operating system instance, and can install almost any software that runs on the OS; however, due to the number of virtualization clients typically running on a single machine, a VPS generally has limited processor time, RAM, and disk space.  Motivation  Ultimately, it is used to decrease hardware costs by condensing a failover cluster to a single machine, thus decreasing costs dramatically while providing the same services. Server roles and features are generally designed to operate in isolation. For example, Windows Server 2019 requires a certificate authority and a domain controller to exist on independent servers with independent instances of Windows Server. This is because additional roles and features adds areas of potential failure as well as adding visible security risks (placing a certificate authority on a domain controller poses the potential for root access to the root certificate). This directly motivates demand for virtual private servers in order to retain conflicting server roles and features on a single hosting machine. Also, the advent of virtual machine encrypted networks decreases pass-through risks that might have otherwise discouraged VPS usage as a legitimate hosting server.  Hosting  Many companies offer virtual private server hosting or virtual dedicated server hosting as an extension for web hosting services. There are several challenges to consider when licensing proprietary software in multi-tenant virtual environments. With unmanaged or self-managed hosting, the customer is left to administer their own server instance. Unmetered hosting is generally offered with no limit on the amount of data-transferred on a fixed bandwidth line. Usually, unmetered hosting is offered with 10 Mbit/s, 100 Mbit/s or 1000 Mbit/s (with some as high as 10Gbit/s). This means that the customer is theoretically able to use ~3 TB on 10 Mbit/s or up to ~300 TB on a 1000 Mbit/s line per month, although in practice the values will be significantly less. In a virtual private server, this will be shared bandwidth and a fair usage policy should be involved.

The war began when Usman dan Fodio, a prominent Islamic scholar and teacher, was exiled from Gobir by the King Yunfa, one of his former students. Usman dan Fodio assembled a Fulani army to lead in jihad against the Hausa Kingdoms of the north of Nigeria. The forces of Usman dan Fodio slowly took over more and more of the Hausa kingdoms, capturing Gobir in 1808 and executing Yunfa. The war resulted in the creation of the Sokoto Caliphate, headed by Usman dan Fodio, which became one of the largest states in Africa in the 19th century. His success inspired similar jihads in Western Africa. Background The Kanem-Bornu Empire had been in decline in the area from the mid-18th century. The result was the rise of a number of independent Hausa kingdoms throughout the region. Two prominent Hausa kingdoms were Gobir and Zamfara. However, warfare between the Hausa states and with other states were constant for the latter 18th century, resulting in a harsh system of conscription and taxation. The Fulani, a largely pastoral people, were often the victims of Hausa taxation, land control, and other feudal practices. Lead up to war Usman dan Fodio, born in 1754, joined a growing number of traveling Islamic scholars through the Hausa kingdoms in the 1770s and became quite popular in the 1790s. Originally, dan Fodio's preaching received the support of the leadership of Gobir; however, as his influence increased and as he began to advocate for self-defense arming by his followers, his favor with the leadership decreased. Sarkin Gobir Nafata, the king of Gobir, placed a series of restrictions on dan Fodio's preaching. In 1801, Sarkin Gobir Yunfa, a former pupil of dan Fodio, replaced Nafata as king of Gobir. However, Yunfa increased the restrictions on dan Fodio and exiled him from Gobir to the village of Degel. A crisis developed later in 1803 when Yunfa attacked and captured many of the followers of a group associated with dan Fodio. Yunfa then marched the prisoners through Degel, enraging many of dan Fodio's followers, who attacked the army and freed the prisoners. Yunfa gave dan Fodio the option of exile before destroying Degel, which led to the large-scale hijra of dan Fodio's community to Gudu. So many people went with dan Fodio throughout the state that on February 21, 1804, Yunfa declared war on dan Fodio and threatened punishment to anyone joining him. Followers of dan Fodio declared him to be the Amir al-Mu'minin, commander of the faithful, and denounced their allegiance to Gobir. Battles Several minor skirmishes preceded the forces meeting at the Battle of Tsuntua. Although Yunfa was victorious and dan Fodio lost a number of men, the battle did not diminish his force. He retaliated by capturing the village of Matankari, which resulted in the battle of Tafkin Kwattoa, a major action between Yunfa and dan Fodio's forces. Although outnumbered, dan Fodio's troops were able to prevent Yunfa from advancing on Gunu and thus convince larger numbers of people to join his forces. In 1805, the forces of dan Fodio, the jihadists, captured the Hausa kingdom of Kebbi. By 1807, the jihadists had taken over the states of Katsina, Daura, and Kano. In 1808, the jihadists captured Gobir, killing Yunfa in the battle. With the capture of Gobir, the jihadists saw that they were part of a wider regional struggle. They continued with battles against a number of Hausa kingdoms, and the Sokoto Caliphate expanded over the next two years. The last major expansion of the jihadists was the toppling of the Sayfawa dynasty in 1846. Founding of the Sokoto Caliphate Muhammed Bello, the son of Usman dan Fodio, transformed the semi- permanent camp of Sokoto into a city in 1809, during the Fulani war. Dan Fodio ruled from Sokoto as the religious leader of the Fulani jihad states from that point until 1815, when he retired from administrative duties. The Caliphate appointed various Emirs to govern the various states of the empire. These men were often veterans of the Fulani wars. Legacy The success of the jihad inspired a number of later West African jihadists, including Massina Empire founder Seku Amadu, Toucouleur Empire founder Umar Tall, Wassoulou Empire founder Samori Ture, and Adamawa Emirate founder Modibo Adama. The Sokoto Caliphate has continued to the present. Since the British conquest of the Caliphate in 1903, and later Nigerian independence under a constitutional government in 1960, the Caliphate's political authority has diminished. But the position still has considerable spiritual authority.

Nonetheless, from an external perspective, D. S. Warner is usually considered the main founder of the Church of God Anderson and its branches. of the Church of God (Anderson) and other similar church groups. He is also known for some of his songs which other church groups have incorporated into their hymnody. He is mostly known by only the initials of his given and middle name, D. S. Warner, which was typical for his time period. Biography =Early years= Daniel Sidney Warner was born June 25, 1842 in Bristol (now Marshallville), Ohio to David and Leah Warner. His father ran a tavern at the time of his birth and later was known for his drinking, but his mother, of Pennsylvania Dutch stock, is recorded by Warner to have been more virtuous.Warner, D.S., Journal, July 18, 1876. He was the fifth of six children. His speaking abilities were noted even in his youth, when he would occasionally give political speeches in his home area. During the American Civil War, Warner volunteered to serve as a private for the Union to replace his brother, Joseph Warner, who had been drafted, since Joseph had a family. =Early Christian life= Warner became a Christian in February 1865, at the age of 23. He attended Oberlin College for a short while and taught in the public schools. On Easter Sunday of 1867, Warner preached his first sermon in a Methodist Episcopal Meeting using Acts 13:18 as his text.Warner, D.S., Journal, April 27, 1873. In September of the same year, he married Tamzen Ann Kerr and in October was licensed to preach by the Winebrennarian Church of God. In May 1872, Tamzen Warner died after the birth of their still-born triplets. She had already borne a son who died at birth. Warner was an effective evangelist in the Winebrennarian church (over 700 people responded to his altar calls during the first decade of his ministryWarner, D.S., Journal, July 6, 1877.), preaching throughout northwest Ohio and northern Indiana for about six years. He was then assigned a mission post in Nebraska for two years, a work to which he gave himself wholeheartedly, even if it meant long, lonely spells of absence from his wife, Sarah Keller, whom he had married on June 4, 1874.Morrison and Allison, pp. 27-28. =Holiness movement= He returned to Ohio, and on July 7, 1877, he claimed to have experienced entire sanctification. Earlier in his life, he had rejected the behavior of the holiness movement, writing of a certain meeting: \\"Nearly all blew loudly the horn of sanctification but manifested little of its fruits...\\" However, through the influence of his in-laws, he began to think favorably of this growing movement. It would ultimately give the course of his life a new direction. On September 15, 1877 the first charges of associating with the holiness movement were brought against him by the Winebrennerian Church of God, which were sustained shortly thereafter by a church trial. His license to preach was renewed on the condition that he would not bring \\"holiness\\" workers in to hold meetings in the Churches of God (Winebrennarian) without their consent. On December 8 of the same year, he consecrated himself to God to be an evangelist in the growing movement. On December 13, 1877, his diary entry contains his Covenant with God: ‚ÄúAmen, LORD. I am yours, forever. Fill me with Your presence, now. LORD, reveal Yourself in me. At Your feet I humbly bow to receive the holy seal.‚Äù On January 30, 1878, he was expelled from the West Ohio Eldership of the Church of God (Winebrennarian) on three counts: 1) transcending the restrictions of the Eldership 2) violating rules of cooperation, 3) participating in dividing the church. In his own eyes, Warner felt he was expelled for espousing and preaching entire sanctification. After his expulsion, he sought fellowship with various groups, including some Mennonites and the Salvation Army. Even this time of fruitful ministry was marred by personal sorrow. His three-year-old daughter, Levilla Modest, died of meningitis in June 1878, the fifth child that Warner was forced to bury. =New movement= The Winebrennarian Church of God eventually suffered a division over the issue of membership in secret societies. Coming into contact with the side that opposed membership in these societies (Northern Indiana Eldership of the Church of God, which also was more open to holiness teachings), Warner joined with them. But not long after, in October, 1881, he separated from this group at its Eldership meeting at Beaver Dam, Indiana when the elders rejected some proposals made by him. Five other persons \\"took a stand\\" with Warner and they formed the first congregation of the new movement. Also in October 1881, Joseph C. and Allie R. Fisher, along with about eighteen others, separated from the Northern Michigan Eldership of the Church of God (Winebrennarian) at Carson City, Michigan, forming the second congregation. These congregations were the culmination of Warner's desire for non-sectarian Holiness congregations, of which he had dreamed since January 31, 1878 when he noted in his diary: \\"On the 31st of last January the Lord showed me that holiness could never prosper upon sectarian soil encumbered by human creeds and party names, and he gave me a new commission to join holiness and all truth together and build up the apostolic church of the living God. Praise His name! I will obey him.\\" On April 22, 1881, Warner \\"came out\\" of all holiness associations, saying, \\"We were positively denied membership [in any holiness association] on the ground of not adhering to any sect. And now we wish to announce to all that we wish to cooperate with all Christians, as such, in saving souls‚Äîbut forever withdraw from all organisms that uphold and endorse sects and denominations in the body of Christ.\\" \\"Anti-sectarianism\\" would become a watchword for his followers for many years afterward. His detractors would call his movement the \\"come-outers\\".This was in reference to coming out of the \\"Babylon\\" of sectarianism. Warner and his associates often cited 2 Corinthians 6:17 as God's call to separate themselves from sects: \\"Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord...\\" =Personal grief= During 1890, Sarah Warner divorced D. S. Warner. They had lived separated since 1884. The issues surrounding their separation remain somewhat clouded, but when she filed for divorce, she claimed that Daniel was not supporting her financially.Daniel Warner and the Paradox of Religious Democracy in 19th Century America, Thomas A. Fudge, Lewiston, New York, Edwin Mellen Press, 1998 Three months after the separation, she turned over custody of Sidney, the only child of Daniel Warner to survive past childhood, to Daniel. Later, she remarried. In 1893, she died of typhoid fever at Cincinnati, Ohio. Believing it wrong to remarry as long as he had a living spouse, Daniel did not remarry until Sarah had died. A few months after her death, he was united in marriage to Francis Miller, his third and last wife. =Publishing ventures= On March 11, 1879 Warner became half owner and joint editor with I. W. Lowman of the Herald of Gospel Freedom. The following year, he was given complete charge of this publication. During 1880, D S. Warner published his first book, Bible Proofs of the Second Work of Grace. In the minds of early Church of God leaders, this action signified the beginning of the Church of God Reformation movement. The following year, the Herald of Gospel Freedom was consolidated with The Pilgrim (published in Indianapolis, Indiana by G. Haines) to become the Gospel Trumpet. This publication would continue for many decades after his death as the official publication of the movement which was just now gaining momentum. (The Gospel Trumpet was renamed Vital Christianity in 1962 and ceased publication in 1996.) Under Warner, the first two issues of the Gospel Trumpet were published in Rome City, Indiana. But Warner moved his printing equipment to Indianapolis early in 1881. In June 1881, G. Haines dissolved the partnership with Warner and started an opposition holiness paper. J.C. Fisher then joined D.S. Warner as partner in the Gospel Trumpet. Fisher's name disappeared from the paper's masthead in early 1887 after he divorced his wife and married a divorcee named Alice Davis. On June 21, 1887, Enoch E. Byrum purchased Fisher's share of the Gospel Trumpet and became its publisher and business manager. Byrum would edit this paper for nearly twenty years after the death of Warner. (In several letters and editorials, Warner held out the hope that Fisher would reconcile with his ex-wife and return to the movement, but he did not.) =Evangelistic efforts= In the fall of 1884, Warner conducted revival tours and preached at camp meetings in the midwestern United States. He formed an evangelistic preaching company in the summer of 1886 with members including Nannie Kiger of Payne, Ohio; Francis Miller (his later wife) of Battle Creek, Michigan; Sarah Smith of Jerry City, Ohio; John U. Bryant and David Leininger of Beaver Dam, Indiana; and Barney E. Warren of Lacota, Michigan. From June 1887 to April 1888, Warner conducted an evangelistic tour through Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, and Colorado. During the same summer, he preached at camp meetings in Missouri, Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The following winter, he conducted an evangelistic tour to Ontario, Canada. In the winter of 1890, Warner conducted a southern evangelistic tour into Mississippi and Alabama. His evangelistic company dissolved after this tour. During 1891, he conducted evangelistic tours in Pennsylvania and Ontario, Canada. In August 1892 to February 1893, he conducted an evangelistic tour as far as California. =Final years= In January through February 1894, Warner helped with an evangelistic tour down the Ohio River on a refloated barge known as the Floating Bethel. On December 1, 1895, Daniel Sidney Warner preached his last sermon on Sunday morning at the Gospel Trumpet Office in Grand Junction, Michigan. The topic of his sermon was Christian growth. E.E. Byrum and his brother Noah Byrum purchased the remaining publishing business interests of Allie R. Fisher and a local lumberman named Sebastian Michels. Two days before Warner's death, he and the Byrum brothers signed papers conveying their rights to a nonprofit corporation named the Gospel Trumpet Publishing Company (now Warner Press, Inc., located in Anderson, Indiana). Warner died on December 12, 1895 and was buried on the Church of God campgrounds at Grand Junction. =Personal interests= Warner wrote many poems and songs. Most of his song lyrics were set to music by others, chiefly Barney E. Warren. His strong admiration for the beauty of nature revealed itself in his poetry. Warner was interested in health foods such as graham flour and he resolved to incorporate these foods into his diet. He wrote in one of his field reports to the Gospel Trumpet, \\"One thing we much regret that there is not more wisdom among the saints respecting healthy diet. Laboring in five counties in Ind. and two in Mich., we have not found a single family that did not have pork on their table about every meal. In fact we do not recollect a single meal without pork. Now this is a very unhealthy food... Another great pity is the common use of white bread. O that God may keep His saints from thus wasting the precious wheat He gives us.Warner also studied and lectured occasionally on phrenology, which attempted to determine one's personality traits and acumen by measuring the size and shape of that person's head. Doctrines and beliefs Although he did not consider himself to be a theologian as such, Warner's theology was rooted in several sources. He seems to have been an avid reader, and had friends across a broad spectrum of denominations from which he gleaned his insights. From the Wesleyan tradition he took his view of salvation. From the Winebrennarian Church of God he gained his view of the Church. From the Anabaptists, he picked up non-resistance and non-conformity, and from the Adventists he took some of his eschatology. His two prominent teachings stand out as the \\"one Church\\": all believers are members of the church of God. He taught in his booklet \\"What the Church of God Is and What it is Not\\" that the call to join various bodies must be of the Antichrist. He wrote, \\"Therefore the multiplicity of sects, falsely called churches, are not God‚Äôs church.\\"The Church of God: What It Is and What It Is Not by D. S. Warner His other prominent theme was that of holiness. The following is an overview of the main doctrines that characterized Warner's life and teachings: *One Church called the \\"Church of God\\", which is composed of all the \\"saved\\" people; no membership list *Holiness of life-freedom from sin; a life dedicated to the Kingdom of God and its mission. This was accomplished by a \\"second, definite, work of grace\\"; the baptism of the Holy Ghost that purified the heart of the sin nature *Against \\"Babylon\\"; that is, all false religion that held a different name or espoused teachings outside or independent of the Word of God *The imminent second coming of Christ. Warner said \\"the Lord has promised him that he should live until Jesus returned.\\"The Teachings of D. S. Warner and His Associates by C. W. Naylor *Non-resistance; non-participation in the military *Separation from \\"the world\\" in actions, beliefs, and lifestyle, which included modesty of dress without added adornment of jewelry, cosmetics, neckties, etc., and opposition to membership in secret societies *Foot washing, baptism by immersion, and the Lord's Supper as ordinances *Leadership led by the Holy Ghost, rather than \\"man-rule\\" that dictates what the local minister can preach, with no official ministerial training or salaries, permitting women in the ministry *Divine healing by faith without the assistance of doctors *Marriage as \\"one man-one woman\\" for life, with no remarriage while the first spouse remained alive. For some second marriages already consummated before conversion, the couple was left to decide for themselves if they should separateDivorce and Remarriage by D. S. Warner Movement that followed Warner's reform movement eventually formalized itself into the Church of God (Anderson), with unofficial headquarters in Anderson, Indiana, and began to behave like other denominations. To this day, this group -and others who have derived from it- refers to itself as a movement rather than a denomination and does not practice formal church membership. The movement grew numerically in such a degree that it became the fastest growing denomination in the USA during the first few decades of the 20th century. This was in spite of several defections and divisions. =Zinzendorfism= The first major defection from Warner's movement occurred in the latter years of the 1890s. A large number of ministers and congregations left the movement over a disagreement on the doctrine of sanctification. This defection is generally known as \\"The Anti-cleansing Heresy\\" or Zinzendorfism by the followers of Warner. Those leaving were unable to unite into a unified group and soon were dispersed among other denominations. =Faith and victory movement= About 1910, some concerned ministers and lay people began to speak up about \\"worldliness\\" creeping into the movement. The main issue was over the use of a neck-tie, which was considered as \\"outward adornment\\". However, the concerns were broader than this one point, and included singing \\"worldly songs\\", courtship practices, using slang. Within a few years a small number of ministers, including C.E. Orr, Willis M. Brown, N.S. Duncan, and W.H. Shoot, began the Herald of Truth paper. Eventually, the conservatives would gather into what is now called the Church of God (Guthrie, Oklahoma). Some of the dissenters later returned to the main group.John W. V. Smith, The Quest for Holiness and Unity, Warner Press, 1980, pp. 193-204 =7th-seal movement= About 1940, some of the \\"Anderson\\" congregations began to express dissatisfaction with what they discerned to be \\"drifting\\" in the movement in areas such as mixed bathing between boys and girls, modesty, the entrance of the television into the home, the wearing of jewelry, and other practices which they considered to be at variance with what Daniel Warner had taught as Biblical truths. By the early 1940s, many ministers and congregations began to feel that the now existing headquarters and committees of the church were not addressing these concerns, and instead were \\"compromising\\" further the original message of Daniel Warner and the teachings of the Bible in order to gain fellowship with other denominations. Because of this, these individuals and congregations felt impressed of God to \\"take their stand for truth\\" and separate from the mainline movement. It became the general consensus of the time that these following ministers were upset by the direction that C. E. Brown, editor of the Gospel Trumpet, was taking concerning a popular message of D. S. Warner, \\"Come Out of Her My People\\". Brown believed that there were saved people in all churches and denominations; that indeed the \\"Church of God\\" was a much larger body than Warner's movement. Brown also advocated theological training for ministers, which appeared to be a threat to those concerned with the \\"drift\\". This situation with the \\"7th-sealers\\" mirrored an earlier historical event concerning Earl Slacum and the \\"Watchmen Movement\\", which had created a schism. Slacum later felt he had erred, repented and was restored to fellowship with the Church of God (Anderson, Indiana). The dissenting congregations and individuals, including Charles Kline, Harold Barbor, N. Bogart, H. Pittman, John R. Crouch, R. Hines, G.W. Powell, H. Littek, E. Henry, Emerson Wilson, and H. Griffin, felt that they had received more light from God concerning the original eschatology of the movement. Based on this alleged \\"light\\", these ministers began to teach that Daniel Warner had been a part of the sounding of the sixth trumpet of Revelation, but now the seventh trumpet was sounding, calling men once again from Babylon and sectarianism, which included the now allegedly apostatized Anderson movement in their view. In contrast, the majority of Warner's movement felt that the 7th-seal message was a false teaching, with some even feeling that those churches associated with it used cult-like control of the followers. Likewise, the 7th-seal churches claimed they were following the original message that Daniel Warner preached, while others adamantly proclaimed that it was not so. Since the 1940s, the 7th-seal movement has splintered into at least 6 documented schisms.Church of God Family Tree Influences Church groups deriving from D. S.

Plutarch linked Manetho with the Ptolemaic cult of Serapis. Altes Museum, Berlin. Manetho (; Man√©th≈çn, gen.: ŒúŒ±ŒΩŒ≠Œ∏œâŒΩŒøœÇ) is believed to have been an Egyptian priest from Sebennytos () who lived in the Ptolemaic Kingdom in the early third century BC, during the Hellenistic period. He authored the Aegyptiaca (History of Egypt) in Greek, a major chronological source for the reigns of the pharaohs of ancient Egypt. It is unclear if he wrote his work during the reign of Ptolemy I Soter or Ptolemy II Philadelphos, but no later than that of Ptolemy III Euergetes. Only two full English translations of Manetho's Aegyptiaca have been published, by William Gillian Waddell in 1940 and by Gerald P. Verbrugghe and John Moore Wickersham in 2001. Name The original Egyptian version of Manetho's name is lost, but some speculate it means \\"Truth of Thoth\\", \\"Gift of Thoth\\", \\"Beloved of Thoth\\", \\"Beloved of Neith\\", or \\"Lover of Neith\\".Waddell (1940), p. ix, n. 1. Less accepted proposals are Myinyu-heter (\\"Horseherd\\" or \\"Groom\\") and Ma'ani-Djehuti (\\"I have seen Thoth\\"). In the Greek language, the earliest fragments (the inscription of uncertain date on the base of a marble bust from the temple of Serapis at CarthageCorpus Inscriptionum Latinarum viii. 1007: \\"ŒúŒëŒùŒïŒòŒ©Œù\\" and the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus of the 1st century AD) writes his name as ŒúŒ±ŒΩŒ≠Œ∏œâŒΩ Maneth≈çn, so the Latinised rendering of his name here is given as Manetho.The same way that Plat≈çn is rendered \\"Plato\\"; see Greek and Latin third declension. Other Greek renderings include Maneth≈çs, Maneth≈ç, Manethos, Manƒìth≈çs, Manƒìth≈çn, and Maneth≈çth. In Latin it is written as Manethon, Manethos, Manethonus, and Manetos. Life and work Although no sources for the dates of his life and death remain, Manetho is associated with the reign of Ptolemy I Soter (323‚Äì283 BC) by Plutarch (c. 46‚Äì120 AD) while George Syncellus links Manetho directly with Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285‚Äì246 BC). Ptolemy Philadelphus in the Library of Alexandria, by 337x337px If the mention of someone named Manetho in the Hibeh Papyri, dated to 241/240 BC, is in fact the celebrated author of the Aegyptiaca, then Manetho may well have been working during the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes (246‚Äì222 BC) as well but at a very advanced age. Though the historicity of Manetho of Sebennytus was taken for granted by Josephus and later authors the question as to whether he actually existed remains problematic. The Manetho of the Hibeh Papyri has no title and this letter deals with affairs in Upper Egypt not Lower Egypt where our Manetho is thought to have functioned as a chief priest. The name Manetho is rare but there is no reason a priori to assume that the Manetho of the Hibeh Papyri is the historian from Sebennytus who is thought to have authored the Aegyptiaca for Ptolemy Philadelphus. Manetho is described as a native Egyptian and Egyptian would have been his mother tongue. Though the topics he supposedly wrote about dealt with Egyptian matters, he is said to have written exclusively in the Greek language for a Greek-speaking audience. Other literary works attributed to him include Against Herodotus, The Sacred Book, On Antiquity and Religion, On Festivals, On the Preparation of Kyphi, and the Digest of Physics. The treatise Book of Sothis has also been attributed to Manetho. It is important to note that not one of these works are actually attested during the Ptolemaic period when Manetho of Sebennytus is said to have lived. In fact, they are not mentioned in any source prior to the 1st century AD. This would be a gap of three centuries between the time the Aegyptiaca was supposedly composed and its first attestation. The gap is even larger for the other works attributed to Manetho such as The Sacred Book which is mentioned for the very first time by Eusebius in the 4th century AD.Waddell (1940), pp. 188-189. If Manetho of Sebennytus was an historical figure he was probably a priest of the sun-god Ra at Heliopolis (according to George Syncellus, he was the chief priest). He was considered by Plutarch to be an authority on the cult of Serapis (a derivation of Osiris and Apis). Serapis itself was a Greco-Macedonian version of the Egyptian cult, probably started after Alexander the Great's establishment of Alexandria in Egypt. A statue of the god was imported in 286 BC by Ptolemy I Soter (or in 278 BC by Ptolemy II Philadelphus) as Tacitus and Plutarch attest.Tacitus, Histories 4.83; Plutarch, De Iside et Osiride 28. There was also a tradition in antiquity that Timotheus of Athens (an authority on Demeter at Eleusis) directed the project together with Manetho, but the source of this information is not clear and it may originate from one of the literary works attributed to Manetho, in which case it has no independent value and does not corroborate the historicity of Manetho the priest-historian of the early 3rd century BC. Aegyptiaca The Aegyptiaca (, Aigyptiaka), the \\"History of Egypt\\", may have been Manetho's largest work, and certainly the most important. It was organised chronologically and divided into three volumes, and his division of rulers into dynasties was an innovation. However, he did not use the term in the modern sense, by bloodlines, but rather, introduced new dynasties whenever he detected some sort of discontinuity whether geographical (Dynasty IV from Memphis, Dynasty V from Elephantine), or genealogical (especially in Dynasty I, he refers to each successive Pharaoh as the \\"son\\" of the previous to define what he means by \\"continuity\\"). Within the superstructure of a genealogical table, he fills in the gaps with substantial narratives of the Pharaonic kings. Some have suggested that Aegyptiaca was written as a competing account to Herodotus' Histories, to provide a national history for Egypt that did not exist before. From this perspective, Against Herodotus may have been an abridged version or just a part of Aegyptiaca that circulated independently. Unfortunately, neither survives in its original form today. = Transmission and reception = The problem with a close study of Manetho, despite the reliance of Egyptologists on him for their reconstructions of the Egyptian dynasties, is that not only was Aegyptiaca not preserved as a whole, but it also became involved in a rivalry among advocates of Egyptian, Jewish and Greek histories in the form of supporting polemics. During this period, disputes raged concerning the oldest civilizations, and so Manetho's account was probably excerpted during this time for use in this argument with significant alterations. Material similar to Manetho's has been found in Lysimakhos of Alexandria, a brother of Philo, and it has been suggested that this was inserted into Manetho. We do not know when this might have occurred, but scholars specify a terminus ante quem at the 1st century AD, when Josephus began writing. The earliest surviving attestation to Manetho is that of Josephus' Contra Apionem (\\"Against Apion\\") nearly four centuries after Aegyptiaca was composed. Even here, it is clear that Josephus did not have the originals, and constructed a polemic against Manetho without them. Avaris and Osarseph are both mentioned twice (1.78, 86‚Äì87; 238, 250). Apion 1.95‚Äì97 is merely a list of kings with no narratives until 1.98, while running across two of Manetho's dynasties without mention (Dynasties XVIII and XIX). Contemporaneously or perhaps after Josephus wrote, an Epitome of Manetho's work must have been circulated. This would have involved preserving the outlines of his dynasties and a few details deemed significant. For the first ruler of the first Dynasty, Menes, we learn that \\"he was snatched and killed by a hippopotamus\\". The extent to which the epitome preserved Manetho's original writing is unclear, so caution must be exercised. Nevertheless, the epitome was preserved by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius of Caesarea. Because Africanus predates Eusebius, his version is usually considered more reliable, but there is no assurance that this is the case. Eusebius in turn was preserved by Jerome in his Latin translation, an Armenian translation, and by George Syncellus. Syncellus recognized the similarities between Eusebius and Africanus, so he placed them side by side in his work, Ecloga Chronographica. These last four copies are what remains of the epitome of Manetho. Other significant fragments include Malalas's Chronographia and Excerpta Latina Barbari (\\"Excerpts in Bad Latin\\"). =Sources and methods= Manetho's methods involved the use of king-lists to provide a structure for his history. There were precedents to his writing available in Egypt (plenty of which have survived to this day), and his Hellenistic and Egyptian background would have been influential in his writing. Josephus records him admitting to using \\"nameless oral tradition\\" (1.105) and \\"myths and legends\\" (1.229) for his account, and there is no reason to doubt this, as admissions of this type were common among historians of that era. His familiarity with Egyptian legends is indisputable, but how he came to know Greek is more open to debate. He must have been familiar with Herodotus, and in some cases, he even attempted to synchronize Egyptian history with Greek (for example, equating King Memnon with Amenophis, and Armesis with Danaos). This suggests he was also familiar with the Greek Epic Cycle (for which the Ethiopian Memnon is slain by Achilles during the Trojan War) and the history of Argos (in Aeschylus's Suppliants). However, it has also been suggested that these were later interpolations, particularly when the epitome was being written, so these guesses are at best tentative. At the very least, he wrote in fluent Koin√™ Greek. King lists The king-list that Manetho had access to is unknown to us, but of the surviving king-lists, the one most similar to his is the Turin Royal Canon (or Turin Papyrus). The oldest source with which we can compare to Manetho are the Old Kingdom Annals (c. 2500-2200 BC). From the New Kingdom are the list at Karnak (constructed by order of Thutmose), two at Abydos (by Seti I and Ramesses II-- the latter a duplicate but updated version of the former), and the Saqqara list by the priest Tenry. The provenance of the Old Kingdom Annals is unknown, surviving as the Palermo Stone. The differences between the Annals and Manetho are great. The Annals only reach to the fifth dynasty, but its pre-dynastic rulers are listed as the kings of Lower Egypt and kings of Upper Egypt. By contrast, Manetho lists several Greek and Egyptian gods beginning with Hephaistos and Helios. Secondly, the Annals give annual reports of the activities of the kings, while there is little probability that Manetho would have been able to go into such detail. The New Kingdom lists are each selective in their listings: that of Seti I, for instance, lists seventy-six kings from Dynasties I to XIX omitting the Hyksos rulers and those associated with the heretic Akhenaten. The Saqqara list, contemporaneous with Ramesses II, has fifty-eight names, with similar omissions. If Manetho used these lists at all, he would have been unable to get all of his information from them alone, due to the selective nature of their records. Verbrugghe and Wickersham argue: These large stelae stand in contrast to the Turin Royal Canon (like Saqqara, contemporaneous with Ramesses II), written in hieratic script. Like Manetho, it begins with the gods, and seems to be an epitome very similar in spirit and style to Manetho. Interestingly, the opposite side of the papyrus includes government records. Verbrugghe and Wickersham suggest that a comprehensive list like this would be necessary for a government office \\"to date contracts, leases, debts, titles, and other instruments (2000:106)\\" and so could not have been selective the way the king-lists in temples were. Despite numerous differences between the Turin Canon and Manetho, the format must have been available to him. As a priest (or chief priest), he would have had access to practically all written materials in the temple. While the precise origins for Manetho's king-list are unknown, it was certainly a Northern Lower Egyptian one. This can be deduced most noticeably from his selection of the kings for the Third Intermediate Period. Manetho consistently includes the Tanite Dynasty 21 and Dynasty 22 lineage in his Epitome such as Psusennes I, Amenemope and even such short-lived kings like Amenemnisu (5 years) and Osochor (6 years). In contrast, he ignores the existence of Theban kings such as Osorkon III, Takelot III, Harsiese A and Pinedjem I and kings from Middle Egypt like Peftjaubast of Herakleopolis. This implies that Manetho derived the primary sources for his Epitome from a local city's temple library in the region of the River Nile Delta which was controlled by the Tanite-based Dynasty 21 and Dynasty 22 kings. The Middle and Upper Egyptian Pharaohs did not have any effect upon this specific region of the Delta; hence their exclusion from Manetho's king-list. Transcriptions of Pharaonic names By the Middle Kingdom, Egyptian kings each had five different names, the \\"Horus\\" name; the \\"Two Ladies\\" name; the \\"Gold Horus\\" name; the praenomen or \\"throne name\\"; and a nomen, the personal name given at birth (also called a \\"Son of Ra\\" name as it was preceded by Sa Re'). Some Pharaohs also had multiple examples within these names, such as Ramesses II who used six Horus names at various times. Because Manetho's transcriptions agree with many king-lists, it is generally accepted that he was reliant on one or more such lists, and it is not clear to what extent he was aware of the different pharaonic names of rulers long past (and he had alternate names for some). Not all the different names for each king have been uncovered. Manetho did not choose consistently from the five different types of names, but in some cases, a straightforward transcription is possible. Egyptian Men or Meni (Son of Ra and king-list names) becomes Menes (officially, this is Pharaoh I.1 Narmer--\\"I\\" represents Dynasty I, and \\"1\\" means the first king of that dynasty), while Menkauhor/Menkahor (Throne and king-list names, the Horus names is Menkhau and the Son of Ra name is \\"Kaiu Horkaiu[...]\\") is transcribed as Menkheres (V.7 Menkauhor). Others involve a slight abbreviation, such as A'akheperen-Re' (Throne and king-list names) becoming Khebron (XVIII.4 Thutmose II). A few more have consonants switched for unknown reasons, as for example Tausret becoming Thouoris (XIX.6 Twosre/Tausret). One puzzle is in the conflicting names of some early dynastic kings-- though they did not have all five titles, they still had multiple names. I.3/4 Djer, whose Son of Ra name is Itti is considered the basis for Manetho's I.2 Athothis. I.4 Oenephes then is a puzzle unless it is compared with Djer's Gold Horus name, Ennebu. It may be that Manetho duplicated the name or he had a source for a name unknown to us. Finally, there are some names where the association is a complete mystery to us. V.6 Rhathoures/Niuserre's complete name was Set-ib-tawi Set-ib-Nebty Netjeri-bik-nebu Ni-user-Re' Ini Ni-user-Re', but Manetho writes it as Rhathoures. It may be that some pharaohs were known by names other than even just the five official ones. Thus, how Manetho transcribed these names varies, and as such we cannot reconstruct the original Egyptian forms of the names. However, because of the simplicity with which Manetho transcribed long names (see above), they were preferred until original king-lists began to be uncovered in Egyptian sites, translated, and corroborated. Manetho's division of dynasties, however, is still used as a basis for all Egyptian discussions. =Content= Volume 1 begins from the earliest times, listing gods and demigods as kings of Egypt. Stories of Isis, Osiris, Set, or Horus might have been found here. Manetho does not transliterate either, but gives the Greek equivalents by a convention that predates him: (Egyptian) Ptah = (Greek) Hephaistos; Isis = Demeter; Thoth = Hermes; Horus = Apollo; Seth = Typhon; etc. This is one of the clues as to how syncretism developed between seemingly disparate religions. He then proceeds to Dynastic Egypt, from Dynasty I to XI. This would have included the Old Kingdom, the First Intermediate Period, and the early Middle Kingdom. Volume 2 covers Dynasties XII‚ÄìXIX, which includes the end of the Middle Kingdom and the Second Intermediate Period (XV‚ÄìXVII--the Hyksos invasion), and then their expulsion and the establishment of the New Kingdom (XVIII onward). The Second Intermediate Period was of particular interest to Josephus, where he equated the Hyksos or \\"shepherd-kings\\" as the ancient Israelites who eventually made their way out of Egypt (Apion 1.82‚Äì92). He even includes a brief etymological discussion of the term \\"Hyksos\\". Volume 3 continues with Dynasty XX and concludes with Dynasty XXX (or XXXI, see below). The Saite Renaissance occurs in Dynasty XXVI, while Dynasty XXVII involves the Achaemenid interruption of Egyptian rule. Three more local dynasties are mentioned, though they must have overlapped with Persian rule. Dynasty XXXI consisted of three Persian rulers, and some have suggested that this was added by a continuator. Both Moses of Chorene and Jerome end at Nectanebo II (\\"last king of the Egyptians\\" and \\"destruction of the Egyptian monarchy\\" respectively), but Dynasty XXXI fits within Manetho's schemata of demonstrating power through the dynasteia well. The Thirty-second dynasty would have been the Ptolemies. =Similarities with Berossos= Most of the ancient witnesses group him together with Berossos, and treat the pair as similar in intent, and it is not a coincidence that those who preserved the bulk of their writing are largely the same (Josephus, Africanus, Eusebius, and Syncellus). Certainly, both wrote about the same time, and both adopted the historiographical approach of the Greek historians Herodotus and Hesiod, who preceded them. While the subjects of their history are different, the form is similar, using chronological royal genealogies as the structure for the narratives. Both extend their histories far into the mythic past, to give the gods rule over the earliest ancestral histories. Syncellus goes so far as to insinuate that the two copied each other: While this does seem an incredible coincidence, the reliability of the report is unclear. The reasoning for assuming they started their histories in the same year involved some considerable contortions. Berossos dated the period before the Flood to 120 saroi (3,600 year periods), giving an estimate of 432,000 years before the Flood. This was unacceptable to later Christian commentators, so it was assumed he meant solar days. 432,000 divided by 365 days gives a rough figure of 1,183¬Ω years before the Flood. For Manetho, even more numeric contortions ensued. With no flood mentioned, they assumed that Manetho's first era describing the gods represented the ante-diluvian age. Secondly, they took the spurious Book of Sothis for a chronological count. Six dynasties of gods totalled 11,985 years, while the nine dynasties with demigods came to 858 years. Again, this was too long for the Biblical account, so two different units of conversion were used. The 11,985 years were considered to be months of 29¬Ω days each (a conversion used in antiquity, for example by Diodorus Siculus), which comes out to 969 years. The latter period, however, was divided into seasons, or quarters of a year, and reduces to 214¬Ω years (another conversion attested to by Diodorus). The sum of these comes out to 1,183¬Ω years, equal to that of Berossos. Syncellus rejected both Manetho's and Berossos' incredible time-spans, as well as the efforts of other commentators to harmonise their numbers with the Bible. Ironically as we see, he also blamed them for the synchronicity concocted by later writers. =Effect of Aegyptiaca= It is speculated that Manetho wrote at the request of Ptolemy I or II to give an account of the history of Egypt to the Greeks from a native's perspective. However, there is no evidence for this hypothesis. If such were the case, Aegyptiaca was a failure, since Herodotus' Histories continued to provide the standard account in the Hellenistic world. It may also have been that some nationalistic sentiments in Manetho provided the impetus for his writing, but that again is conjecture. It is clear, however, that when it was written, it would have proven to be the authoritative account of the history of Egypt, superior to Herodotus in every way. The completeness and systematic nature in which he collected his sources was unprecedented. Syncellus similarly recognised its importance when recording Eusebius and Africanus, and even provided a separate witness from the Book of Sothis. Unfortunately, this material is likely to have been a forgery or hoax of unknown date. Every king in Sothis after Menes is irreconcilable with the versions of Africanus and Eusebius. Manetho should not be judged on the factuality of his account, but on the method he used to record history, and in this, he was as successful as Herodotus and Hesiod. Finally, in modern times, the effect is still visible in the way Egyptologists divide the dynasties of the pharaohs. The French explorer and Egyptologist Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion reportedly held a copy of Manetho's lists in one hand as he attempted to decipher the hieroglyphs he encountered (though it probably gave him more frustration than joy, considering the way Manetho transcribed the names). Most modern scholarship that mentions the names of the pharaohs will render both the modern transcription and Manetho's version, and Manetho's names are even preferred to more authentic ones in some cases. Today, his division of dynasties is used universally, and this has permeated the study of nearly all royal genealogies by the conceptualization of succession in terms of dynasties or houses.

She has written five series set in the Realm of the Elderlings, which started in 1995 with the publication of Assassin's Apprentice and ended with Assassin's Fate in 2017. Her books have sold over a million copies. Early life Margaret Astrid Lindholm was born in Berkeley, California, in 1952, but from the age of ten, she grew up in Fairbanks, Alaska. After graduating from Austin E. Lathrop High School, she studied at University of Denver for a year and then returned to Alaska. At eighteen, she married Fred Ogden and they returned to his home town of Kodiak, located at the tip of Kodiak Island in south-central Alaska. Writing as Megan Lindholm Hobb at the Trolls & Legends festival in Mons, Belgium in April 2011 Lindholm sold her first short story to a children's magazine, leading to an early career writing for children. Her short fiction for children appeared in magazines such as Humpty Dumpty, Jack and Jill, and Highlights for Children. She also composed educational material, short works of fiction created to a very specific vocabulary list, which were used in SRA's programmed reading material. In the 1970s, Lindholm also began to write short fantasy, publishing short stories in fanzines such as Space and Time (edited by Gordon Linzner). Her first professional sale as a fantasy writer was the short story \\"Bones for Dulath\\", which appeared in the 1979 Amazons! anthology, and which introduced her recurring characters Ki and Vandien. The anthology, published by DAW Books, won a World Fantasy Award for Year's Best Anthology. A second story featuring Ki and Vandien, \\"The Small One,\\" was published in Fantastic Stories in 1980. Until 1995, she continued to publish exclusively under the name Megan Lindholm. Her fiction under that name spans several slices of the fantasy genre, from fantasy adventure (the Ki and Vandien tales) to urban fantasy (Wizard of the Pigeons). Lindholm's first novel, Harpy's Flight, was published by Ace in 1983. It was the first of four novels about the characters Ki and Vandien, the last of which was published in 1989. She contributed short stories to a shared world anthology entitled Liavek from 1985 to 1988, and co-wrote a novel, The Gypsy, with Steven Brust. The Gypsy was released both as a traditional paper book and as part of an enhanced multimedia CD which included the text of the novel as well as the Boiled in Lead album Songs From the Gypsy, which was considered the soundtrack to the novel and featured songs written by Brust and his Cats Laughing bandmate Adam Stemple which had inspired the creation of both the novel and the album. She has continued to publish short stories as Megan Lindholm, including an appearance in the 2013 anthology Year's Best SF 18. Writing as Robin Hobb Robin Hobb, a pseudonym that Lindholm has used for writing works of epic traditional fantasy, first appeared in 1995. The first Robin Hobb novel, Assassin's Apprentice (1995), was the first volume of what grew to be three trilogies narrated in first person by FitzChivalry Farseer, illegitimate son of a prince, and featuring an enigmatic character called the Fool. It was followed by Royal Assassin in 1996 and Assassin's Quest in 1997. She returned to these characters in the Tawny Man Trilogy published between 2001 and 2003, which consists of Fool's Errand, The Golden Fool, and Fool's Fate. As of 2003, Robin Hobb had sold over one million copies of her first nine novels, which formed three trilogies set in the Realm of the Elderlings. From 1998 to 2000, Hobb released Ship of Magic, The Mad Ship and Ship of Destiny, about a family of traders and their living ships. From 2009 to 2013, Hobb released the four novels of The Rain Wild Chronicles (Dragon Keeper, Dragon Haven, City of Dragons and Blood of Dragons). These two series are set in the same world as Hobb's earlier trilogies. The Soldier Son trilogy (Shaman's Crossing, Forest Mage, and Renegade's Magic) are Hobb's only novels to be set outside of the Realm of the Elderlings, and were published between 2006 and 2009. In addition, The Inheritance, published in 2011, was a collection of short stories written both as Robin Hobb and as Megan Lindholm. In 2013, Hobb announced that she would resume the story, decades later in life, of her two most popular characters in the Realm of the Elderlings series. The first volume of the Fitz and the Fool trilogy, Fool's Assassin, was published in August 2014, and the second, Fool's Quest, a year later. The final volume, Assassin's Fate, was published in May 2017. Assassin's Fate is a sequel not only to her earlier books featuring Fitz but to the Liveship and Rain Wilds books. Critical reception In 1981, Megan Lindholm was awarded an Alaska State Council of the Arts prize for her short story \\"The Poaching.\\" As Megan Lindholm, her short fiction works have been finalists for both the Nebula and the Hugo awards, and winner of the Asimov's Readers Award. Her books have been praised by Orson Scott Card, who has stated that she \\"arguably set the standard for the modern serious fantasy novel\\".Beach-Bag Books. George R.R. Martin has praised her work, writing that her books are like \\"diamonds in a sea of zircons.\\" In 2014, she was a Guest of Honor at the 72nd World Science Fiction Convention in London. Personal life She currently publishes under both names, and lives in Tacoma, Washington.

For the Pali word, see Rhys, Davids & Stede (1921‚Äì25), p. 197, entry for \\"KaruƒÅ\\" (retrieved at ), where it is defined as \\"pity, compassion\\". In general, contemporary scholars, translators and interpreters have consistently translated the word as \\"compassion,\\" not \\"pity.\\" This can be seen, for instance, in (listed chronologically) Warder (1970/2004, p. 95), √ëƒÅ·πáamoli (Buddhaghosa & √ëƒÅ·πáamoli, 1975/1991, Vsm. IX.77ff., pp. 306ff.), Saddhatissa (1985/1994, p. 3, Sn 3.39), Thanissaro (1994, AN 3.65), Salzberg (1995, pp. 102ff.), Gethin (1998, p. 187), and Bodhi (2000, SN 41.7, p. 1325). It is part of the spiritual path of both Buddhism and Jainism. Buddhism KaruƒÅ is important in all schools of Buddhism. For Theravada Buddhists, dwelling in karuƒÅ is a means for attaining a happy present life and heavenly rebirth. For MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhists, karuƒÅ is a co- requisite for becoming a Bodhisattva. =Theravada Buddhism= In TheravƒÅda Buddhism, karuƒÅ is one of the four \\"divine abodes\\" (brahmavihƒÅra), along with loving kindness (PƒÅli: mettƒÅ), sympathetic joy (mudita) and equanimity (upekkha).Gethin (1998), pp.186-187; and, Rhys Davids & Stede, op. cit. In the Pali canon, the Buddha recommends cultivating these four virtuous mental states to both householders and monastics.For instance, in the KƒÅlƒÅmƒÅ Sutta (AN 3.65), the Buddha speaks of all Noble Disciples (ariya-savaka) developing the brahmaviharas (Thanissaro, 1994). When one develops these four states, the Buddha counsels radiating them in all directions, as in the following stock canonical phrase regarding karuƒÅ: Such a practice purifies one's mind, avoids evil-induced consequences, leads to happiness in one's present life and, if there is a future karmic rebirth, it will be in a heavenly realm.AN 3.65 (Thanissaro, 1994). In regards to in which heavenly realm a frequent karuƒÅ dweller will be reborn, AN 4.125 (Thanissaro, 2006) identifies it as the realm of radiant (abhassara) devas, whose lifespans last two eons. The Pali commentaries distinguish between karuƒÅ and mettƒÅ in the following complementary manner: Karuna is the desire to remove harm and suffering (ahita-dukkha-apanaya-kƒÅmatƒÅ) from others; while mettƒÅ is the desire to bring about the well-being and happiness (hita-sukha-upanaya-kƒÅmatƒÅ) of others.Sn-A 128 (cited by Rhys Davids & Stede, 1921‚Äì25, op. cit.); see also, BDEA & BuddhaNet (n.d.). Similarly, the post-canonical Visuddhimagga, chapter IX, vv. 105-109, provides further elucidation, such as with a metaphor describing mettƒÅ as a mother's wish for her (healthy) child to grow up and karu·πáƒÅ as a mother's wish for her sick child to get well (Buddhaghosa & Nanamoli, 1975/99, pp. 313-4). The \\"far enemy\\" of karuƒÅ is cruelty, a mind-state in obvious opposition. The \\"near enemy\\" (quality which superficially resembles karuƒÅ but is in fact more subtly in opposition to it), is (sentimental) pity: here too one wants to remove suffering, but for a partly selfish (attached) reason hence not the pure motivation. Buddhagosha, 'Vishudimagga' Section 2.99 In the Pali Canon, buddhas are also described as choosing to teach \\"out of compassion for beings.\\"In Pali, sattesu ... kƒÅru√±√±ata·πÉ pa·π≠icca, found in DN 3.6 (regarding Vipassƒ´ Buddha), MN 26.21 and SN 6.1 (see, e.g., Bodhi, 2000, pp. 233, 430, n. 362; and Thanissaro, 1997). It is worthwhile noting as well that several other references in the Pali Canon to the Buddha's acting out of \\"compassion\\" are not related directly to karu·πáƒÅ but to the synonymous anukampƒÅ (which is also defined as \\"mercy\\" in Rhys Davids & Stede, 1921-25, p. 34). =Mahayana Buddhism= In MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism, karuƒÅ is one of the two qualities, along with enlightened wisdom (Sanskrit: praj√±a), to be cultivated on the bodhisattva path. According to scholar Rupert Gethin, this elevation of karuƒÅ to the status of praj√±a is one of the distinguishing factors between the TheravƒÅda arahant ideal and the MahƒÅyƒÅna bodhisattva ideal: Throughout the MahƒÅyƒÅna world, Avalokite≈õvara (Sanskrit; Chinese: Guan Yin; Japanese: Kannon; Tibetan: Chenrezig) is a bodhisattva who embodies karuƒÅ. In the Intermediate section of the Stages of Meditation by Kamala≈õƒ´la, he writes: In Tibetan Buddhism, one of the foremost authoritative texts on the Bodhisattva path is the BodhisattvacaryƒÅvatƒÅra by Shantideva. In the eighth section entitled Meditative Concentration, Shantideva describes meditation on KarunƒÅ as thus: Jainism KaruƒÅ is associated with the Jain practice of compassion. For instance, karuƒÅ is one of the four reflections of universal friendship -- along with amity (Sanskrit: maitri), appreciation (pramoda) and equanimity (madhyastha)‚Äîused to stop (samvara) the influx of karma.Shah (n.d.). Regarding samvara, see \\"Release from karmas\\". From a comparative religion perspective, cf. Buddhism's four brahmavihara; for instance, maitri is often identified as a Sanskrit correlate of the Pali mettƒÅ (Rhys Davids & Stede, 1921-5, p. 540, entry for \\"MettƒÅ,\\" retrieved at ). Miscellaneous KaruƒÅ is a common first name throughout India, used for both genders.

He played for several teams, but his longest tenure was in New York, where he was responsible for the New York Gothams becoming known as the Giants. He was the player whom Babe Ruth succeeded as the all-time home run champion. Connor hit 138 home runs during his 18-year career, and his career home run record stood for 23 years after his retirement in 1897. Connor owned and managed minor league baseball teams after his playing days. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by its Veterans Committee in 1976. Largely forgotten after his retirement, Connor was buried in an unmarked grave until a group of citizens raised money for a grave marker in 2001. Early life Connor was born in Waterbury, Connecticut. He was the son of Irish immigrants Mortimer Connor and Catherine Sullivan Connor. His father had arrived in the United States only five years before Roger's birth.Kerr, p. 8. The family lived in the Irish section of Waterbury, known as the Abrigador district, which was separated from the rest of the city by a large granite hill. Connor was the third of eleven children born to the family, though two did not survive childhood. Connor left school around age 12 to work with his father at the local brass works.Kerr, p. 9. Connor entered professional baseball with the Waterbury Monitors of the Eastern League in 1876. Though he was left-handed, Connor was initially a third baseman; in early baseball, left-handed third basemen were more common than they are in modern baseball. In 1878 he would transfer to the minor league Holyoke Shamrocks, where he became known for hitting home runs across the field into the Connecticut River. This so-impressed Springfield baseball boss Bob Ferguson that he signed Connor onto the National League (NL) Troy Trojans when he bought them out in 1880. MLB playing career =Early years (1880‚Äì1889)= In Connor's first year with the Troy Trojans, he teamed with future Hall of Fame players Dan Brouthers, Buck Ewing, Tim Keefe and Mickey Welch, all of whom were just starting their careers. Also on that 1880 Trojans team, though much older, was player-manager Bob \\"Death to Flying Things\\" Ferguson. Though Connor, Ferguson and Welch were regularly in the lineup, the other future stars each played in only a handful of the team's 83 games that season. The team finished in fourth place with a 41-42 win-loss record.1880 Statistics and Roster, 1880 Troy Trojans. Baseball-Reference.com. Connor committed 60 errors in 83 games and sustained a shoulder injury, prompting a position change to first baseman for 1881. He later played for the New York Gothams, and, due to his great stature, gave that team the enduring nickname \\"Giants\\". Connor hit baseball's first grand slam on September 10, 1881 at Riverfront Park in Rensselaer, New York. His grand slam came with two outs and his team down three runs in the bottom of the ninth inning, a situation known today as a walk-off home run. George Vecsey, in The New York Times wrote: \\"Roger Connor was a complete player ‚Äî a deft first baseman and an agile base runner who hit 233 triples and stole 244 bases despite his size (6 feet 3 inches and 200 pounds).\\" He led the NL with a .371 average in 1885. On September 11, 1886, Connor hit a ball completely out of the Polo Grounds, a very difficult park in which to hit home runs. He hit the pitch from Boston's Old Hoss Radbourn over the right field fence and onto 112th Street. The New York Times reported of the feat, \\"He met it squarely and it soared up with the speed of a carrier pigeon. All eyes were turned on the tiny sphere as it soared over the head of Charlie Buffinton in right field.\\"Land of the Giants: New York's Polo Grounds, Stew Thornley (2000), Temple University Press, , Excerpt pg. 26 A group of fans with the New York Stock Exchange took up a collection for Connor and bought him a $500 gold watch in honor of the home run. =Players' League (1890)= Another New York baseball team, also known as the Giants, emerged with the founding of the Players' League (PL) in 1890. Several players from the NL team left for the new league's Giants team, including future Hall of Famers Connor, Keefe, Jim O'Rourke and Hank O'Day. In 123 games, Connor registered 169 hits, a .349 batting average, 14 home runs, 103 runs batted in (RBI) and 22 stolen bases. His home run total led the league and it represented the only major league single-season home run title that he won. Connor experimented with some changes to his batting style that year. He hit more balls to the opposite field and he sometimes batted right-handed, though he did not have much success from the right side.Kerr, p. 103. Though Connor had success in his season with the PL, the league struggled. Some of the teams ran into financial difficulties. National League teams rescheduled many of their games to conflict with PL games in the same cities, and a high number of PL games were cancelled late in the season due to rainouts. Connor was optimistic that the league would be successful in 1891, but it officially broke up that January. =Later career (1891‚Äì1897)= Returning to the NL Giants for a season in 1891, Connor hit .294. In the offseason before 1892, Connor signed with the Philadelphia Athletics. The team broke up shortly after Connor signed, and his contract was awarded to the Philadelphia Phillies for that year. He returned to the Giants in 1893, raising his average to .322 and hitting 11 home runs. During the 1894 season, the Giants looked toward the team's youth and Connor lost his starting position to Jack Doyle. He was released that year and picked up by the St. Louis Browns. The next year, his brother Joe Connor made his major league debut with the same team. Joe played two games with St. Louis before being sent back down to the minor leagues. That year's St. Louis team finished with a 39-92 record, games out of first place.Kerr, p. 134. Connor was released by the Browns in May 1897 after starting the season with a .227 batting average. His major league playing career was over. While a major league player, Connor was regularly among the league leaders in batting average and home runs. Connor's career mark of 138 was a benchmark not surpassed until 1921 by Babe Ruth. He finished his career with a .317 batting average.Baseball Almanac, Roger Connor Stats, accessed May 2007. Connor finished in the top ten in batting average ten times, all between 1880 and 1891. Over an 18-year career, Connor finished in the top ten for doubles ten times, finished in the top three for triples seven times and remains fifth all-time in triples with 233. He also established his power credentials by finishing in the top ten in RBI ten times and top ten in homers twelve times.Roger Connor Statistics. Baseball-Reference.com. Personal In 1886, Connor and his wife Angeline had a daughter named Lulu. She died as an infant. Connor interpreted the baby's death as God's punishment for marrying Angeline, who was not Catholic. Angeline had secretly begun receiving Catholic education and was planning to surprise Connor by getting baptized on the day that Lulu would have turned a year old. The couple later adopted a girl named Cecelia from a Catholic orphanage in New York City.Kerr, p. 113. Roger and Angeline Connor lived in Waterbury, Connecticut, for many years, even while Roger played in New York. Every winter, a banquet was held in Waterbury in Connor's honor. Near the end of the 19th century, Angeline gave Roger a weather vane which had been constructed from two of his baseball bats. The weather vane served as a well-known landmark in Waterbury even after the couple moved away. Later life =Minor league baseball= Connor signed with the Fall River Indians of the New England League in June 1897. Connor attracted some attention by wearing eyeglasses on the field. He hit cleanup, played first base and was popular among fans. In 1898, Connor moved back to his hometown of Waterbury and purchased the local minor league team. He served as president, manager and played first base on the side. Connor's wife Angeline kept the team's books and his daughter helped by collecting tickets. Joe Connor was the team's catcher; he later returned to the major leagues for several seasons. After the 1899 season, Connor expressed satisfaction with his Waterbury team, saying that the team played well and did not lose money despite not getting strong attendance numbers at their games. In 1901, Connor became interested in purchasing the minor league franchise in Hartford, Connecticut. The team had been dropped from the Eastern League and had suffered financial losses related to traveling as far away as Canada for games. Connor proposed that he might purchase the team and attempt to have it admitted to the State Baseball League, decreasing its travel requirements. However, upon selling the Waterbury club at the end of that season, he bought the Springfield franchise in the same league. =Retirement from baseball= Plaque of Roger Connor at the Baseball Hall of Fame In September 1903, Connor announced his retirement from baseball and placed his team up for sale. He had made a similar statement the year before and apparently on a frequent basis before that. In June 1902, the local newspaper said, \\"Roger bobs up every summer and makes his farewell to the baseball public.\\" His 1903 retirement was earnest though; he attended a 1904 Springfield-Norwich game as a retired spectator. Connor worked as a school inspector in Waterbury until 1920. He lived to see his career home run record bested by Babe Ruth, although if it was celebrated, it might have been on the wrong day. At one time, Connor's record was thought to be 131, per the Sporting News book Daguerreotypes. As late as the 1980s, in the MacMillan Baseball Encyclopedia, it was thought to be 136. However, John Tattersall's 1975 Home Run Handbook, a publication of the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), credited Connor with 138. Both MLB.com and the independent Baseball-Reference.com now consider Connor's total to be 138. =Death= Connor died on January 4, 1931, following a lengthy stomach illness. He was 73. A news article after his death said that his \\"likeable personality and his colorful action made him an idol.\\" He was buried in an unmarked grave at St. Joseph's Cemetery in Waterbury. Connor was inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1976. Hall of Fame umpire Bill Klem had long campaigned on behalf of Connor's inclusion in the Hall of Fame. Decades after his death, Waterbury citizens and baseball fans raised enough money to purchase a headstone at his grave, which was dedicated in a 2001 ceremony.

The party represented the legal opposition to apartheid within South Africa's white minority. It opposed the ruling National Party's policies of apartheid, and championed the Rule of Law. For 13 years its only member of parliament was Helen Suzman.In No Uncertain Terms - A South African Memoir, Helen Suzman, Alfred A Knopf, 1993 It was later renamed the Progressive Reform Party in 1975, and then Progressive Federal Party in 1977. The modern Democratic Alliance considers the party to be its earliest predecessor. The Progressive Party of South Africa is not to be confused with the much earlier Progressive Party of the Cape Colony, which was founded on very different, pro-imperialist policies and which became the \\"Union Party\\" in 1908. Creation The Progressive Party was formed by members who had left the United Party following the United Party Union Congress held in Bloemfontein starting on 11 August 1959. The delegates at the Party Congress passed policy resolutions about the political rights the party wished to give to Natives. The Progressives found these resolutions unacceptable. A Progressive Group of MPs led by Dr Bernard Friedman, began to organize a new party. The first meeting of the Group took place at the home of Helen Suzman, MP for the Transvaal seat of Houghton. This meeting took place on 23‚Äì24 August 1959. The Progressive Party began its founding Congress on 13 November 1959, in Johannesburg. Jan Steytler, a former Cape leader of the United Party, was elected the first leader of the new Party. At the session of Parliament in 1960, the Progressive Party had twelve MPs. Eleven had been first elected for the United Party and one (a Native Representative Member) defected from the Liberal Party of South Africa. By the end of that Parliament in 1961, the group had been reduced to ten as a result of the abolition of the Native Representative seats at the end of 1960 and the resignation of one MP in January 1961. Electoral history At the General Election, held on 18 October 1961, the Progressive Party performed relatively well for a new party, putting up a credible performance against the United Party in many of the seats it contested, especially in the Transvaal and Natal. However, the electoral system worked to the party's disadvantage, and although it came very close in Parktown, Helen Suzman in Houghton was the only Progressive Party candidate to actually be elected. It would be thirteen years before she again had party colleagues in Parliament. In that time Mrs Suzman was re-elected in 1966 and 1970. In those years, she singlehandedly did the work of an entire opposition party and would become a well known figure both inside South Africa and abroad. Following the disappointing result of the election, support for the party amongst white voters had dropped substantially by 1966, and focus instead shifted towards attracting coloured votes. The Progressive Party won two seats representing coloured voters on the Cape Provincial Council in 1965. The National Party responded by extending the term of the four national coloured representative members, and ultimately abolished coloured electoral representation by 1970, thus preventing the party from winning those seats. Despite gains in some white constituencies, Mrs Suzman once again became its only MP or MPC. Jan Steytler continued as party leader until December 1970, but being outside Parliament he was far less visible than the member for Houghton. Harry Lawrence, a former Minister and the most senior of the MPs who had left the United Party in 1959, became temporary leader. In February 1971 Colin Eglin from Cape Town was elected party leader. At the next General Election, on 24 April 1974, the Progressive Party made a major advance. In addition to Mrs Suzman, re-elected for Houghton, five other members won seats including Colin Eglin. A seventh member of the caucus was elected at a by-election soon after. Three members also won seats on the Transvaal and Cape Provincial Councils. This brought the party out of the political wilderness and set it on the path towards becoming the official opposition. Merger with Reform Party A group of reformists broke away from the left wing of the United Party in February 1975. Four MPs led by Harry Schwarz, formed the Reform Party. The Reform Party merged with the Progressive Party to form the Progressive Reform Party, following Congresses held in Johannesburg on 25 and 26 July 1975. Subsequently, the PRP merged with another breakaway group from the United Party, which was in sharp decline in the mid 1970s, to become the Progressive Federal Party in 1977.

It is a member of the International Federation of Film Archives.  Objectives  Its three principal objectives are: to trace, acquire and preserve for posterity the heritage of Indian cinema; to classify, document data and undertake research relating to films; to act as a centre for the dissemination of film culture.  Organization  With headquarters at Pune, Maharashtra, NFAI has three regional offices at Bangalore, Calcutta and Thiruvananthapuram. Developed from scratch by P. K. Nair, NFAI's activities relating to dissemination of film culture are manifold. Its Distribution Library has about 25 active members throughout the country and it also organises joint screening programmes on weekly, fortnightly and monthly basis in six important centres. It has over 10,000 films, over 10,000 books, over 10,000 film scripts, and over 50,000 photographs. Another important programme is the film teaching scheme comprising long and short term Film Appreciation courses conducted in collaboration with the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) and other educational and cultural institutions. At the International level, NFAI supplied several Indian classics for major screening programmes. The NFAI's archive keeps a stock of films, video cassettes, DVDs, books, posters, stills, press clippings, slides, audio CDs, and disc records of Indian cinema dating back to the 1910s.  State of Preservation  On 8 January 2003, a large fire caused a massive destruction in the vault of NFAI housed in the Prabhat Studio complex of Film and Television Institute of India in Pune, in which unduplicated irreplaceable films with a nitrate base were destroyed. Ravi Shankar Prasad the then Minister of State, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India announced in the Rajya Sabha that 607 films in 5,097 reels were lost in the fire. Among the greatest loss were films by Dadasaheb Phalke including: Raja Harishchandra, 1913; Lanka Dahan, 1917; Kaliya Mardan, 1919. Important films produced by Prabhat Film Company, Wadia Movietone, Bombay Talkies and New Theatres, were also gutted, namely: Bhakta Prahlada, 1932; Amar Jyoti, 1936; Manoos, 1939 Aage Badho, 1947. In March 2019, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India reported that 31,000 reels at the NFAI were reported lost or destroyed, when it audited the records between May 1, 2015 and September 30, 2017.

The Ashanti Confederacy was a major Akan kingdom in West Africa and within the Gold Coast. The Fante were a related Akan group that was based mainly along the coastal regions of the Gold Coast. Rivalry between the Ashanti and Fante had long existed, historically, the Fante being considered a breakaway group of the original Akan clan, but by the beginning of the 19th century, this rivalry had escalated to hostility. At the time, the British were the traditional European allies of the Fante, whereas the Dutch sided with the Ashanti. The war began when the Ashanti king, known as the Asantehene, brought charges of robbing graves on a number of Fante subjects from the town of Assin. Fleeing Ashanti lands, these accused people were granted refuge by the Fante. Ashanti king Osei Bonsu sent out an army against the Fante. At Abora, four miles from the Fanti town of Cape Coast, a battle was fought, in which the Ashanti were victorious and they captured the accused. The meagre Fante forces had faced a much larger Ashanti army, but fought bravely. Ashanti troops went on to attack the Dutch fort at Kormantine (Fort Amsterdam). The British then tried to appease the belligerent Ashanti. Colonel Torrane, British commander of the Fante town of Cape Coast, handed over Kwadwo Otibu, the old and blind Assin king to the Asantehene, despite the very real possibility of his being executed by the Ashanti, which he later was.

It is a toggle key: each press reverses its action. Some keyboards also implement a light, to give visual feedback about whether it is on or off. Exactly what Caps Lock does depends on the keyboard hardware, the operating system, the device driver, and the keyboard layout. Usually, the effect is limited to letter keys; letters of Latin-based scripts are capitalized, while letters of other texts (e.g. Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi) and non-letter characters are generated normally.  History The Caps Lock key originated as a Shift lock key on mechanical typewriters. An early innovation in typewriters was the introduction of a second character on each typebar, thereby doubling the number of characters that could be typed, using the same number of keys. The second character was positioned above the first on the face of each typebar, and the typewriter's Shift key caused the entire type apparatus to move, physically shifting the positioning of the typebars relative to the ink ribbon. Just as in modern computer keyboards, the shifted position was used to produce capitals and secondary characters. The Shift lock key was introduced so the shift operation could be maintained indefinitely without continuous effort. It mechanically locked the typebars in the shifted position, causing the upper character to be typed upon pressing any key. Because the two shift keys on a typewriter required more force to operate and were meant to be pressed by the little finger, it could be difficult to hold the shift down for more than two or three consecutive strokes, therefore the introduction of the Shift lock key was also meant to reduce finger muscle pain caused by repetitive typing. Mechanical typewriter shift lock is typically set by pushing both Shift and lock at the same time, and released by pressing Shift by itself. Computer Caps Lock is set and released by the same key, and the Caps Lock behavior in most QWERTY keyboard layouts differs from the Shift lock behavior in that it capitalizes letters but does not affect other keys, such as numbers or punctuation. Some early computer keyboards, such as the Commodore 64, had a Shift lock but no Caps Lock; others, such as the BBC Micro, had both, only one of which could be enabled at a time. =Abolition= There are some proposals to abolish the caps-lock key as being obsolete.Daniel Colin James, It‚Äôs time for Caps Lock to die\\", Medium, May 24, 2019. Retrieved July 14, 2019. Pieter Hintjens, the CEO of iMatix, started a \\"Capsoff\\" organization proposing hardware manufacturers delete the caps-lock key.\\"Death to Caps Lock\\", Wired, August 2006. Retrieved July 14, 2019. Google has removed the Caps Lock on the Chromebook keyboard (replacing it with a \\"search' button); the caps-lock function is then reproduced using an \\"alt\\" key combination.Anna Attkisson, \\"How to Turn On Caps Lock on a Chromebook\\", Laptop Magazine, January 23, 2018. Retrieved July 14, 2019. In fact, the current German keyboard layout standard DIN 2137-01:2018-12 specifies the function of the key as optional, to be replaced by other keys or key combinations. It recommends the function only to be invoked when it is pressed simultaneously with the Ctrl key, while otherwise it acts as a ‚Äúleft AltGr key‚Äù, thus enabling touch typists to access all key combinations using AltGr without using two fingers of the same hand, which is considered to be an ergonomic advantage. As a side effect, any inadvertent pressing of this key without pressing another key simultaneously has no effect.  Behavior  Caps Lock on an Apple keyboard. The green LED on the key is lit, indicating that Caps Lock is on. Typical Caps Lock behavior is that pressing the key sets an input mode in which all typed letters are uppercase, if applicable. The keyboard remains in Caps Lock mode and would generate all caps text until the key is pressed again. Keyboards often include a small LED to indicate that Caps Lock is active, either on the key itself or in a dedicated indicators area, where Scroll lock and Num lock indicators are also located. On the original IBM PC keyboard, this LED was exclusively controlled by the keyboard. Since the introduction of IBM AT, however, it is under control of the operating system. Small keyboards, such as netbook keyboards, forgo the indicators to conserve space, instead providing software that gives an on-screen or audio feedback. In most cases, the status of the Caps Lock key only changes the meaning of the alphabet keys, not that of any other key. Microsoft Windows enforces this behavior only when a keyboard layout for a Latin-based script is active, e.g. the \\"English (United States)\\" layout but not the \\"Persian\\" layout. However, on certain non-QWERTY keyboard layouts, such as the French AZERTY and the German QWERTZ, Caps Lock still behaves like a traditional Shift lock, i.e., the keyboard behaves as if the Shift key is held down, causing the keyboard to input the alternative values of the keys; example the \\"5\\" key generates a \\"%\\" when Caps lock is pressed. This is not true for the layout \\"German (IBM)\\". Depending on the keyboard layout used, the Shift key, when pressed in combination with a Latin-based letter button while Caps Lock is already on, is either ignored, or reverses the effect of Caps Lock, so that typed characters are in lowercase again. Microsoft Windows enforces the latter. RISC OS offers both ‚Äì CapsLock alone chooses the former, Shift-CapsLock the latter. While the typical locking behavior on keyboards with Caps Lock key is that of a toggle, each press reversing the shift state, some keyboard layouts implement a combi mode, where pressing a Shift key in Caps Lock mode will also release the Caps Lock mode, just as it typically happens in Shift lock mode. Some keyboard drivers include a configuration option to deactivate the Caps Lock key. This behavior allows users to decide themselves whether they want to use the key, or to disable it to prevent accidental activation. In the Unix communities of the ex-USSR countries, Caps Lock key is traditionally used as input language switcher, convenient for usage with touch typing. Support for this is present in KDE, GNOME and other desktop environments. Default Russian, Ukrainian layouts for FreeBSD specifies Caps Lock as input language switcher. In Microsoft Windows, however, third-party utilities are needed to enable this behavior. In such configurations, the original Caps Lock function is reached with the combination. = Precautions = Most apps that request users to input a password do not display it on screen, so as not to expose it to prying eyes. A user who does not pay proper attention to the Caps Lock indicator, however, might end up typing the wrong password (in which all small letters become capital letters or vice versa). As such, help guides, tech support materials, and app user interfaces may include warnings on checking the Caps Lock state before typing a password. In Microsoft Windows login screens, a warning that Caps Lock is on is shown in a balloon near the field. In macOS, when Caps Lock is on, a Caps Lock symbol (‚á™) is displayed inside a password field.  Placement  Modern keyboard that can exchange Caps Lock and left Control keys Since its inception, the IBM PC keyboard had a Caps Lock. In the first version for PC/XT, Caps Locks was located to the bottom right of the letter keys area. However, subsequent models switched the places of the Caps Lock key and the Control key. As such, Caps Lock has since been placed on left edge of the keyboard, above the Shift key and below the Tab key, next to letter A. This layout has become the de facto popular standard. The keyboards of some early computer terminals, including the Teletype Model 33 ASR and Lear-Siegler ADM-3A, the Apple II and a few Apple Keyboard models retained the Control key where PC/XT first had it; Caps Lock was either absent on these device or was placed elsewhere. This layout was preserved for later workstation systems and is often associated with Unix workstations. Keyboards from Sun Microsystems came in two layouts; \\"Unix\\" and \\"PC-style\\", with the Unix layout having the traditional placing of the Control key and other keys.Sun hardware reference manual The Amiga computers all had both the Control key and Caps Lock key in this spot at half the width. Some users of keyboards with Caps Lock on the left remap the keys to exchange Control and Caps Lock, finding the traditional location more ergonomic for using programs benefiting from use of the Control key. Keyboard layout preferences specifically to address this need are available in some operating systems. Some keyboards even provide a switch on the bottom to logically swap the two keys in hardware. The Happy Hacking Keyboard and the keyboards produced for OLPC XO computers also have the Control key in this location, while not including a Caps Lock. Beginning with the Google Cr-48, Chromebooks have omitted Caps Lock in favor of a dedicated \\"Search\\" key. However, holding down Alt and pressing the Search Key enables Caps Lock, which is enabled until Shift is pressed.

The gold spray coating served no purpose other than to hide the blackened interior, as Mullard valves were still manufactured using the azide process, long abandoned by other makers. A Mullard EL34 power pentode An EL84 valve made in Russia in the 21st century Mullard Limited was a British manufacturer of electronic components. The Mullard Radio Valve Co. Ltd. of Southfields, London, was founded in 1920 by Captain Stanley R. Mullard, who had previously designed thermionic valves for the Admiralty before becoming managing director of the Z Electric Lamp Co. The company soon moved to Hammersmith, London and then in 1923 to Balham, London. The head office in later years was Mullard House at 1‚Äì19 Torrington Place, Bloomsbury, now part of University College London. Partnership with Philips In 1923, to meet the technical demands of the newly formed BBC, Mullard formed a partnership with the Dutch manufacturer Philips. The valves (vacuum tubes) produced in this period were named with the prefix PM, for Philips-Mullard, beginning with the PM3 and PM4 in 1926. Mullard finally sold all its shares to Philips in 1927. In 1928 the company introduced the first pentode valve to the British market. Factories =Mitcham= Mullard opened a new manufacturing plant at the end of New Road, Mitcham, Surrey in 1929. A second building was added in 1936. Both buildings had a very distinctive flat roof construction and were very similar to those at Philips' headquarters in Eindhoven, Netherlands. Co-sited with the Mullard buildings was the manufacturing complex for Philips Radios. Mitcham was also home to the Mullard Application Laboratory. =Blackburn= In the late 1930s Philips opened a plant in Blackburn, Lancashire, and during the Second World War some operations were moved there from Mitcham; by the end of the war, nearly 3,000 were employed. Tungsten and molybdenum wire were produced on-site from 1954, and a glass factory was built in 1955. In 1962 over 6,200 were employed and Mullard described the Blackburn works as \\"the largest valve manufacturing plant in Europe\\". By 1949 Mullard had produced a number of television sets, such as the MTS-521 and MTS-684. In 1951 Mullard was producing the LSD series of photographic flash tubes. =Others= Mullard had factories in Southport and Simonstone, both in Lancashire. The latter closed in 2004. There was also a sister factory at Belmont in Durham (closed in June 2005). Other factories included those at Fleetwood (closed in 1979) and Lytham St. Annes (closed in 1972). A feeder factory at Haydock closed in 1981. A small factory in Hove closed in the early 1970s. Teletext In the early 1980s, Mullard manufactured the SAA5050, some of the earliest teletext decoding modules made in the UK. Semiconductors thumbMullard transistors of the 1960s, showing the variety of SO-2 packages used: Mullard owned semiconductor factories in Southampton and Hazel Grove, Stockport, Cheshire. Southampton (Millbrook Trading Estate) was a purpose-built plant, opened in 1957 for the manufacture of semiconductors. Production of germanium alloy transistors was transferred from Mitcham. At the same time the plant started the research, development and production of electro optical devices. Fabrication of planar devices on a mass production basis did not begin until 1966, when germanium sales were decreasing. 1967 saw the start the development and production of integrated circuits. The plant was planned to be the biggest semiconductor facility in Europe, employing 3,000 people including 200 scientists and engineers. In 1962 Associated Semiconductor Manufacturers (ASM) Ltd was formed by Mullard and GEC to combine the semiconductor development and production facilities of the two companies; Mullard owned two-thirds of the company and included the Southampton plant; GEC contributed their small factory in School Street, Hazel Grove, producing thyristors, rectifiers and power diodes. GEC pulled out of ASM Ltd in 1969. In 1972 production was moved to a newly constructed factory nearby on Bramhall Moor Lane. Both sites were later owned by NXP Semiconductors (formerly Philips Semiconductors). The Southampton site is now closed. The one in Hazel Grove, Stockport specialises in power semiconductor devices and is now Nexperia Manchester. The first transistors produced by Mullard were the OC50 and OC51 point-contact types in 1952, which were not widely used. In 1953 Mullard moved to junction transistors, beginning with the plastic-cased OC10 series. These were followed by the glass-encapsulated OC43...47,Note: Mullard's OC43...47s were germanium-PNP, while Clevite- Intermetall's OC43...47s, sold at the same time, were silicon-PNP OC70/71, (released in 1957) and OC80 series (the output devices were metal encapsulated to facilitate heatsinking), which were produced in large numbers and copied by other companies, such as Valvo (another Philips subsidiary) and Siemens in Germany, and Amperex in the USA. RF transistors were the OC170 and OC171. All these were germanium PNP transistors. Mullard's first silicon transistors were the OC201 to OC207, PNP alloy types using the standard SO-2 metal-over-glass construction such as the OC201 shown. From about 1960 Mullard switched to using the BC prefix for silicon, and AC for germanium, eliminating the confusion of part numbers. in the mid 1960s the first plastic packages were introduced. In 1964 the company produced a prototype electronic desktop calculator as a technology demonstrator for its transistors and cold cathode indicator tubes. Space science In 1957 Philips-Mullard helped to set up the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory (MRAO) at the University of Cambridge. In 1966 the Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL) was opened near Dorking, Surrey as part of University College London. The Royal Society Mullard Award for young scientists and engineers was set up in 1967. Mullard brand name Philips continued to use the brand name \\"Mullard\\" in the UK until 1988. Mullard Research Laboratories in Redhill, Surrey then became Philips Research Laboratories. As of 2007, the Mullard brand has been revived by Sovtek, producing a variant of the ECC83 and EL34. Z Electric Lamp Company The Z Electric Lamp Co. continued business into the 1970s operating from premises in Thornton Heath, southern Greater London, manufacturing lamps of specialised design. However, it closed due to the recession in the mid 1970s.

It is variable in color, coming in shades of mottled green, gray, and brown.Rhacodactylus leachianus. Australian Reptile Park. Distribution and habitat R. leachianus is found in all of the southern and eastern portions of the main island of New Caledonia, as well as on several of the smaller islands in the group. Biology R. leachianus is an arboreal species, living in trees. It is crepuscular, but may come out to bask in the sun during the day. It eats a diet of insects, spiders, small vertebrates, fruit, nectar, and sap. Adult females of R. leachianus lay two eggs at a time, having up to 4 clutches per year. R. leachianus can make a loud growling noise, and local people call it \\"the devil in the trees\\". Folklore Some of the indigenous Kanak people of New Caledonia fear Leach's giant gecko. This is because of an old superstition which purports that it has the ability to cling to a person's body and pull out that person's soul. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FJNE4V7aPI LEACHIANUS GECKOS IN THE WILD, PART 1!

It won the 1996 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. Synopsis The Centauri Emperor, knowing that he will die soon, makes arrangements to travel to Babylon 5 to meet with Narn Ambassador G'Kar in neutral territory and offer a public apology on behalf of the Centauri people for their occupation and enslavement of the Narn homeworld, though this reason is not made public. G'Kar, on hearing the news of the emperor's visit, makes plans to assassinate him, while Centauri Ambassador Londo Mollari and his ally Lord Refa believe that the emperor's actions have led to a decline of the Centauri Republic and plan to confront the emperor on this. The Emperor arrives, meeting the human command staff of the station, and requests a meeting with Vorlon Ambassador Kosh before he leaves the station. A reception for the Emperor is planned, and the attendees are stunned by seeing G'Kar there. The Emperor collapses before he can make the reception. Dr. Franklin determines the Emperor only has a short time to live, and the Emperor requests that he pass word on to G'Kar about his planned apology. Dr. Franklin tells this to G'Kar, who is astonished and humbled by the act. While the emperor is on his deathbed, Refa urges Londo to take initiative as to sway their supporters on Centauri Prime as to assure Londo will become the next emperor. Londo, against advice of his aide Vir, decides to send a fleet of Centauri warships to a Narn colony on a planet in Quadrant 14. Refa warns the size of the fleet will not be enough to take the planet before he leaves. Privately, Londo tells Vir to contact Mr. Morden, the human spokesman for the Shadows, and to arrange for the Shadows to attack the colony before the Centauri ships arrive. Vir follows the orders, but tells Londo he will regret this decision. Later, G'Kar offers to buy Londo a drink in light of the emperor's apology, unaware of Londo's recent action. The Narn colony is attacked by the Shadows and rendered defenseless. The Centauri ships arrive, which are shortly seen by Narn fighters investigating the attack. Word is relayed to the Narn homeworld, and soon across the system, that the Centauri have taken their colony. Kosh meets with the Emperor, and tells him that the situation will end \\"in fire\\". With the Emperor near death, Refa and Londo meet him at his deathbed. The Emperor whispers something in Londo's ear before he dies. Londo states that the Emperor approved of the attack on the Narn colony, and that he wants Refa and Londo to carry his people \\"back to the stars\\". In private Londo tells Refa that the Emperor told him they were both damned, but Refa shrugs it off as \\"a small price to pay for immortality\\". G'Kar learns of the attack and attempts to kill Londo before he is restrained by security forces. At the council chambers, Sheridan fails to convince Mollari to return the Narn colonists to their homeworld. G'Kar announces that the Narn government is formally at war with the Centauri. A second plotline involves a mysterious man who has been following Chief Garibaldi around. When Garibaldi confronts and arrests him, the man gives him a recorded message from Jeffrey Sinclair, the Earth Alliance Ambassador to Minbar. Sinclair tells Garibaldi that a \\"terrible darkness\\" is coming and that he has become involved with a military force called the \\"Rangers\\" to fight it. Garibaldi agrees to allow the Rangers to operate on the station and to keep their presence a secret, even from Sheridan. In return Garibaldi asks the Rangers to provide him with information they learn which could affect the station's security, to which the Ranger agrees. Delenn is also given a recorded message by the Ranger.  Production  The 1996 Hugo was won in part due to \\"campaigning\\" which was in part done online.

The Rhapsody Trilogy  The Rhapsody Trilogy is based on three characters who find themselves in a land on the brink of disaster. Rhapsody, the main character, is a Namer, a profession that includes passing down the history and lore of the people and the land. As a Namer, Rhapsody, can only speak the truth. A Namer has incredible power because when they speak (or sing) they describe the very nature or essence of a person or a thing. In some instances a Namer can change the parameters of a person or a thing by giving it a new name. When Rhapsody meets up with her two future companions she accidentally uses her Naming power to rename The Brother, a ruthless assassin, to \\"Achmed The Snake.\\" This accident forces Rhapsody to join Achmed and his companion who are on the run from an ancient and dangerous foe, a F'Dor demon. # Rhapsody: Child of Blood (1999) # Prophecy: Child of Earth (2001) # Destiny: Child of the Sky (2002)  The Bridge/Middle Duology Rhapsody, Achmed, Grunthor live out their new lives after the aftermath of the Cymrian Council.

An example would be the conversion of an integer value into a floating point value or its textual representation as a string, and vice versa. Type conversions can take advantage of certain features of type hierarchies or data representations. Two important aspects of a type conversion are whether it happens implicitly (automatically) or explicitly, and whether the underlying data representation is converted from one representation into another, or a given representation is merely reinterpreted as the representation of another data type. In general, both primitive and compound data types can be converted. Each programming language has its own rules on how types can be converted. Languages with strong typing typically do little implicit conversion and discourage the reinterpretation of representations, while languages with weak typing perform many implicit conversions between data types. Weak typing language often allow forcing the compiler to arbitrarily interpret a data item as having different representations‚Äîthis can be a non-obvious programming error, or a technical method to directly deal with underlying hardware. In most languages, the word coercion is used to denote an implicit conversion, either during compilation or during run time. For example, in an expression mixing integer and floating point numbers (like 5 + 0.1), the compiler will automatically convert integer representation into floating point representation so fractions are not lost. Explicit type conversions are either indicated by writing additional code (e.g. adding type identifiers or calling built-in routines) or by coding conversion routines for the compiler to use when it otherwise would halt with a type mismatch. In most ALGOL-like languages, such as Pascal, Modula-2, Ada and Delphi, conversion and casting are distinctly different concepts. In these languages, conversion refers to either implicitly or explicitly changing a value from one data type storage format to another, e.g. a 16-bit integer to a 32-bit integer. The storage needs may change as a result of the conversion, including a possible loss of precision or truncation. The word cast, on the other hand, refers to explicitly changing the interpretation of the bit pattern representing a value from one type to another. For example, 32 contiguous bits may be treated as an array of 32 booleans, a 4-byte string, an unsigned 32-bit integer or an IEEE single precision floating point value. Because the stored bits are never changed, the programmer must know low level details such as representation format, byte order, and alignment needs, to meaningfully cast. In the C family of languages and ALGOL 68, the word cast typically refers to an explicit type conversion (as opposed to an implicit conversion), causing some ambiguity about whether this is a re-interpretation of a bit-pattern or a real data representation conversion. More important is the multitude of ways and rules that apply to what data type (or class) is located by a pointer and how a pointer may be adjusted by the compiler in cases like object (class) inheritance.  Language comparison  =C-like languages= Implicit type conversion Implicit type conversion, also known as coercion, is an automatic type conversion by the compiler. Some programming languages allow compilers to provide coercion; others require it. In a mixed-type expression, data of one or more subtypes can be converted to a supertype as needed at runtime so that the program will run correctly. For example, the following is legal C language code: double d; long l; int i; if (d > i) d = i; if (i > l) l = i; if (d  l) d *= 2; Although , , and belong to different data types, they will be automatically converted to equal data types each time a comparison or assignment is executed. This behavior should be used with caution, as unintended consequences can arise. Data can be lost when converting representations from floating-point to integer, as the fractional components of the floating-point values will be truncated (rounded toward zero). Conversely, precision can be lost when converting representations from integer to floating-point, since a floating-point type may be unable to exactly represent an integer type. For example, might be an IEEE 754 single precision type, which cannot represent the integer 16777217 exactly, while a 32-bit integer type can. This can lead to unintuitive behavior, as demonstrated by the following code: #include int main(void) { int i_value = 16777217; float f_value = 16777216.0; printf(\\"The integer is: %d \\", i_value); printf(\\"The float is: %f \\", f_value); printf(\\"Their equality: %d \\", i_value  f_value); } On compilers that implement floats as IEEE single precision, and ints as at least 32 bits, this code will give this peculiar print-out: The integer is: 16777217 The float is: 16777216.000000 Their equality: 1 Note that 1 represents equality in the last line above. This odd behavior is caused by an implicit conversion of to float when it is compared with . The conversion causes loss of precision, which makes the values equal before the comparison. Important takeaways: # to causes truncation, i.e., removal of the fractional part. # to causes rounding of digit. # to causes dropping of excess higher order bits. =Type promotion= One special case of implicit type conversion is type promotion, where the compiler automatically expands the binary representation of objects of integer or floating-point types. Promotions are commonly used with types smaller than the native type of the target platform's arithmetic logic unit (ALU), before arithmetic and logical operations, to make such operations possible, or more efficient if the ALU can work with more than one type. C and C++ perform such promotion for objects of boolean, character, wide character, enumeration, and short integer types which are promoted to int, and for objects of type float, which are promoted to double. Unlike some other type conversions, promotions never lose precision or modify the value stored in the object. In Java: int x = 3; double y = 3.5; System.out.println(x+y); //The output will be 6.5 Explicit type conversion Explicit type conversion is a type conversion which is explicitly defined within a program (instead of being done by a compiler for implicit type conversion). It is defined by the user in the program. double da = 3.3; double db = 3.3; double dc = 3.4; int result = (int)da + (int)db + (int)dc; //result  9 //if implicit conversion would be used (as with \\"result = da + db + dc\\"), result would be equal to 10 There are several kinds of explicit conversion. ; checked: Before the conversion is performed, a runtime check is done to see if the destination type can hold the source value. If not, an error condition is raised. ; unchecked: No check is performed. If the destination type cannot hold the source value, the result is undefined. ; bit pattern: The raw bit representation of the source is copied verbatim, and it is re-interpreted according to the destination type. This can also be achieved via aliasing. In object-oriented programming languages, objects can also be downcast : a reference of a base class is cast to one of its derived classes. =C# and C++= In C#, type conversion can be made in a safe or unsafe (i.e., C-like) manner, the former called checked type cast. at C# Tutorial Animal animal = new Cat(); Bulldog b = (Bulldog) animal; // if (animal is Bulldog), stat.type(animal) is Bulldog, else an exception b = animal as Bulldog; // if (animal is Bulldog), b = (Bulldog) animal, else b = null animal = null; b = animal as Bulldog; // b  null In C++ a similar effect can be achieved using C++-style cast syntax. Animal* animal = new Cat; Bulldog* b = static_cast(animal); // compiles only if either Animal or Bulldog is derived from the other (or same) b = dynamic_cast(animal); // if (animal is Bulldog), b = (Bulldog*) animal, else b = nullptr Bulldog& br = static_cast(*animal); // same as above, but an exception will be thrown if a nullptr was to be returned // this is not seen in code where exception handling is avoided animal = nullptr; b = dynamic_cast(animal); // b  nullptr delete animal; // always free resources =Eiffel= In Eiffel the notion of type conversion is integrated into the rules of the type system. The Assignment Rule says that an assignment, such as: x := y is valid if and only if the type of its source expression, \`y\` in this case, is compatible with the type of its target entity, \`x\` in this case. In this rule, compatible with means that the type of the source expression either conforms to or converts to that of the target. Conformance of types is defined by the familiar rules for polymorphism in object-oriented programming. For example, in the assignment above, the type of \`y\` conforms to the type of \`x\` if the class upon which \`y\` is based is a descendant of that upon which \`x\` is based. Definition of type conversion in Eiffel The actions of type conversion in Eiffel, specifically converts to and converts from are defined as: > A type based on a class CU converts to a type T based on a class CT (and T > converts from U) if either :CT has a conversion procedure using U as a > conversion type, or :CU has a conversion query listing T as a conversion > type Example Eiffel is a fully compliant language for Microsoft .NET Framework. Before development of .NET, Eiffel already had extensive class libraries. Using the .NET type libraries, particularly with commonly used types such as strings, poses a conversion problem. Existing Eiffel software uses the string classes (such as \`STRING_8\`) from the Eiffel libraries, but Eiffel software written for .NET must use the .NET string class (\`System.String\`) in many cases, for example when calling .NET methods which expect items of the .NET type to be passed as arguments. So, the conversion of these types back and forth needs to be as seamless as possible. my_string: STRING_8 -- Native Eiffel string my_system_string: SYSTEM_STRING -- Native .NET string ... my_string := my_system_string In the code above, two strings are declared, one of each different type (\`SYSTEM_STRING\` is the Eiffel compliant alias for System.String). Because \`System.String\` does not conform to \`STRING_8\`, then the assignment above is valid only if \`System.String\` converts to \`STRING_8\`. The Eiffel class \`STRING_8\` has a conversion procedure \`make_from_cil\` for objects of type \`System.String\`. Conversion procedures are also always designated as creation procedures (similar to constructors). The following is an excerpt from the \`STRING_8\` class: class STRING_8 ... create make_from_cil ... convert make_from_cil ({SYSTEM_STRING}) ... The presence of the conversion procedure makes the assignment: my_string := my_system_string semantically equivalent to: create my_string.make_from_cil (my_system_string) in which \`my_string\` is constructed as a new object of type \`STRING_8\` with content equivalent to that of \`my_system_string\`. To handle an assignment with original source and target reversed: my_system_string := my_string the class \`STRING_8\` also contains a conversion query \`to_cil\` which will produce a \`System.String\` from an instance of \`STRING_8\`. class STRING_8 ... create make_from_cil ... convert make_from_cil ({SYSTEM_STRING}) to_cil: {SYSTEM_STRING} ... The assignment: my_system_string := my_string then, becomes equivalent to: my_system_string := my_string.to_cil In Eiffel, the setup for type conversion is included in the class code, but then appears to happen as automatically as explicit type conversion in client code. The includes not just assignments but other types of attachments as well, such as argument (parameter) substitution. Security issues In hacking, typecasting is the misuse of type conversion to temporarily change a variable's data type from how it was originally defined.Jon Erickson Hacking, 2nd Edition: The Art of Exploitation 2008 1593271441 p51 \\"Typecasting is simply a way to temporarily change a variable's data type, despite how it was originally defined. When a variable is typecast into a different type, the compiler is basically told to treat that variable as if it were the new data type, but only for that operation. The syntax for typecasting is as follows: (typecast_data_type) variable ...\\" This provides opportunities for hackers since in type conversion after a variable is \\"typecast\\" to become a different data type, the compiler will treat that hacked variable as the new data type for that specific operation.Arpita Gopal Magnifying C 2009 8120338618 p.59 \\"From the above, it is clear that the usage of typecasting is to make a variable of one type, act like another type for one single operation.

The original Hourman was created by writer Ken Fitch and artist Bernard Baily in Adventure Comics #48 (April 1940), during the Golden Age of Comic Books. The first Hourman is chemist Rex Tyler, who creates a new synthesis, \\"Miraclo\\", which grants him super-strength and endurance, but only for one hour. Rex Tyler made his live action debut in the season one finale of The CW series DC's Legends of Tomorrow portrayed by Patrick J. Adams. Both Rex and Rick Tyler also appear in the DC Universe series Stargirl portrayed by Lou Ferrigno Jr. and Cameron Gellman respectively. Fictional character biography =Rex Tyler= The original Hourman is Rex Tyler who appeared in the Golden Age of Comic Books and is a common member of the Justice Society of America. =Rick Tyler= Rick Tyler, Rex's son, took over the Hourman mantle during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. Rick swallowed some of his father's Miraclo pills to help him save people trapped in a burning hospital. After serving for a few years as a member of Infinity, Inc., a team composed largely of other JSA-member children, Rick began to grow addicted to Miraclo just as his father did. He spent many years after leaving the group critically ill until Amazo, posing as a future incarnation of the android Hourman, cured him of his Miraclo addiction. Having conquered his personal demons and regaining his health, Rick joined the JSA in its incarnation as a small band of freedom fighters during the \\"Stealing Thunder\\" arc. The android had given him an hourglass full of tachyons that gave Rick random visions one hour into the future. As a second gift, Rick could visit with his father in an otherworldly dimension called the Timepoint, frozen in time, just before Rex's death. At one point, Rick is severely injured in battle, and switched places with his father to save his life. Tyler, the android known as the third Hourman, took Rex and some other JSA members to the Timepoint to save Rick's life. The one hour Rex was allotted in the Timepoint expired just as Doctor Mid-Nite and Tyler had healed Rick of his injuries. Father and son fought over who would perish in the battle with Extant. Ultimately, Tyler the android took Rex's place and was destroyed when Rick and Rex returned to Earth. Rick is once again active as Hourman and is an active member of the JSA. He is married to Jesse Chambers. =Matthew Tyler= In the 853rd century another Hourman, an android that was modeled on Rex Tyler's DNA, served with both the Justice League and the Justice Society for a time. He often perceived himself as Rex and also as Rex's descendant. Originally possessing the time-manipulating cosmic artifact known as the Worlogog, he divested himself of most of its power at the suggestion of Snapper Carr and went about learning to be human. After failing to stop Extant from escaping a fight, Hourman quit the JSA and began travelling through the timestream, returning when he received a distress call from the JSA. As noted above, he is believed to have been destroyed at the hands of Extant in Rex's place, although the time-traveler Rip Hunter mentioned that his actions would leave him inactive for a relative year, indicating his probable return. Before he died, the android also gave his hourglass to Rex Tyler, who hopes to rebuild him. The android briefly used the alias Matthew Tyler and was often simply called Tyler. Powers and abilities Neither Rex nor Rick have any innate powers (though it was once theorized that their powers derive from a metagene, like many DC superheroes). Any superhuman abilities they display are derived from the use of Miraclo. Taking Miraclo grants a user several abilities for the span of an hour. Most obvious are the superhuman strength, durability, increased resistance to physical damage (to the extent of being impervious to small arms fire) and speed enhancements. Other, lesser known and mentioned powers include night vision and the ability to survive underwater. Rex and Rick both took Miraclo in pill form, but Rick later changed to using a transdermal patch. The amount of Miraclo that can be taken per day has varied. Normally, it is once a day, but in some instances, Rex has been shown taking another pill as soon as an \\"Hour of Power\\" runs out. One story states that Rex needed to wait another hour after the Miraclo wore off before taking another dose. Miraclo works specifically on the Tylers and may or may not work on others who take it. In one instance it worked on an animal, Dr. Mid-Nite's owl Hootie, as well as the villain Bane. Rex and Rick both wore an hourglass around their necks given to them by the Hourman Android. It was filled with energized tachyons, time in its most basic form. It gives Rick \\"time vision,\\" flashes of events that will happen exactly one hour later as well as the ability to touch those out of phase with normal time. The latter effect comes to anyone holding the hourglass. Rex displayed neither of these abilities. \\"Tyler\\" is often simply called an android, but is actually an intelligent machine colony (possibly a form of nanotechnology) created by Tylerco in the far future. If damaged, this colony can effortlessly multiply and repair. His software is encoded with the genetics of Rex Tyler, giving him all of Rex's memories. He originally possessed the Worlogog, which gave him complete control over time. He later gave all but a shard of it up, but not before he absorbed all of Batman's memories of the JLA. Though not as powerful as he was originally, Tyler still retained super strength, durability, and speed equivalent to a person using Miraclo. He was able to access an \\"Hour of Power,\\" sixty minutes during which he had power over time. He can do many things with this control: move between picoseconds, travel through time, use his own time vision (which allows him to see a person's past and future, as well as their age) or make people and things younger, slow a person down until essentially frozen, create tunnels between different time periods, and share power with other individuals (though the amount of time that he provides them power for directly takes away from his sixty minutes). Tyler activates the Hour of Power at will and the hourglass on his chest keeps count of the time. There seems to be some doubt how often he can use his Hour of Power. Like the other Hourmans' use of Miraclo, sometimes Tyler is said to only have one Hour of Power a day, while at other times he simply must wait another hour to recharge before he can reactivate, and it is unclear if he must use that Hour of Power in one go or if he can spread it out over the course of the day. Tyler also has a timeship that he can summon from the timestream. It is connected to him and reacts to his thoughts. It normally appears as a Viking- style wooden sailing ship adorned with clocks, but it can change form as Tyler dictates to anything from a simple wooden skiff to a futuristic spaceship and also be used as a weapon, as when Hourman made a large hand out of it to trap Extant. The ship can travel through time, to alternate timelines, or through hypertime. In other media =Television= * The Rick Tyler version of Hourman appears as a member of the Justice League in Justice League Unlimited. In the episode \\"Panic in the Sky\\", he injects himself with Miraclo via his gauntlet. * The Rex Tyler version of Hourman appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"The Golden Age of Justice\\" voiced by Lex Lang. This version uses an hourglass shaped device to fuel his powers instead of Miraclo. He appears as a member of an aged Justice Society. * In November 2013, a live action Hourman series was revealed to be in development at The CW. Michael Caleo was writing the script, to executive produce the series alongside Dan Lin, and Jennifer Gwartz. The premise of the series \\"centers on a brilliant- yet-troubled pharmaceutical analyst who discovers that the visions that have plagued him since childhood are actually glimpses of tragic events occurring one hour in the future. Determined to win back his ex-wife and son, he heroically prevents these tragedies from unfolding, finding both purpose and redemption along the way\\". However, no progress on the series was made after its announcement. * The Rex Tyler version of Hourman appears in Legends of Tomorrow, portrayed by Patrick J. Adams. This version is the leader of the Justice Society of America. He is introduced in the final scene of the first season, where he travels to the future to warn the Legends not to board the Waverider and go to 1942, only to vanish shortly afterwards. During the second season, the team meet Tyler's past self when they ignore and defy his warning. Tyler is killed by Reverse-Flash at the end of the episode \\"The Justice Society of America\\", causing his future self who had found out about Reverse- Flash's plans and warned the Legends to be erased from existence. Before his death, Rex was in a relationship with Amaya Jiwe, the 1940s-era Vixen. * Both the Rex and Rick Tyler iterations of Hourman appear in the DC Universe series Stargirl, portrayed by Lou Ferrigno, Jr. and Cameron Gellman respectively. In this show, both versions of Hourman use a special hourglass amulet that gives them superpowers for one hour. As Hourman, Rex Tyler is the only member of the Justice Society of America to survive a surprise attack by their enemies, the Injustice Society of America. He dedicates himself to avenging his fallen teammates, only to be murdered by Solomon Grundy along with his wife. His son Rick is raised by Rex's brother-in-law Matt, who resents having to be a father and abuses his nephew. Rick becomes an angry young man, and when Courtney Whitmore finds him, he refuses to help her reform the JSA, only to change his mind when he learns the circumstances of his parents' deaths. He also receives his late father's journal from Pat Dugan, which he devotes himself to deciphering while training to become Hourman. =Film= In Justice League: The New Frontier, Superman briefly mentions to Wonder Woman that Hourman is dead; Superman was probably referring to the Rex Tyler version. Hourman is also seen in the opening credits of the film, which show how he dies (being chased by police officers on the rooftops, due to the ban of the vigilantes, and he falls to his death). In the original comic of New Frontier, it is revealed that Hourman is alive and held by the government. This sequence is not in the adaptation.

Ch√∂pal Yeshe is renowned for having constructed several monasteries and retreat-centers. He was also able to abolish the practice of animal sacrifice in the regions of Tibet where that custom had continued.The 3rd Karmapa Rangjung Dorje 1284 - 1339 # Shamar Chokyi Drakpa Yeshe Pal Zangpo (1453‚Äì1526) was recognized by the 7th Karmapa, who became his Lama. The famous Tibetan monastery Ga Mamo Tashi Rabten was founded by him. He also established many smaller monasteries. During his travels outside Tibet, Ch√∂kyi Tragpa built many monasteries, among others there are four monasteries in Bhutan and he was the first of the Shamar reincarnates to visit Nepal where he built a small monastery in Swayambhunath, one of the country's most sacred places. Upon returning to his home-land, he acted as the king of Tibet for a period of twelve years and he ruled the country on the basis of strict adherence to Buddhist principles. # Shamar K√∂ncho Yenlak (1526‚Äì1583) was identified by the 8th Karmapa.

He received teachings and instructions from the 11th Karmapa before his death.

He was taught primarily by the eight Tai Situ Rinpoche, and also recognized the ninth Tai Situ Rinpoche. Shamar Tulku spent many years reviving the Dharma in Tibet. In particular, Shamar Tulku attempted to bring the Kagyu teachings to central Tibet, which was a stronghold of Gelugpa-allied political elements at the time, with the help of his brother the 6th Panchen Lama of the Gelugpa lineage. After carrying out this activity Shamarpa went on pilgrimage to Nepal. According to some sources, a dispute over his claim to his stepbrother's material inheritance led to an armed conflict in which the Shamarpa conspired with the Nepalese Gurkha army in 1788.Norbu, Thubten Jigme and Turnbull, Colin. 1968.

(cloth); (pbk) According to other sources, while Shamarpa was on a pilgrimage to Nepal, fighting broke out between the Nepalese Gurkhas and Tibet. Shamarpa attempted to make peace and mediate in the conflict. In Tibet the influential Gelugpa minister Tagtsag Tenpai Gonpo saw an opportunity to remove a perceived political threat and acquire property. He spread rumors that Shamarpa was instigating the fighting and seized Yang Chen monastery from Shamarpa. The monks were forcibly converted to the Gelug school. Subsequently an order was passed by the government that all of Shamarpa‚Äôs monasteries must convert to the Gelug school. This, and other disputes between the Gelug and Kagyu schools led to the exile from Tibet of the Shamarpa and a legal ban by the Tibetan government on further Shamarpa incarnations This ban remained in place until after the Dalai Lama lost power in Tibet during the 1950s, although it was later revealed that the Karmapa had recognized reincarnations of the Shamarpa secretly during the intervening period.Douglas Nik, White Meryl : Karmapa, the Black Hat Lama of Tibet.

Namling Shamar Following the death of the 9th Shamarpa, two different children were identified as possible candidates to be the reincarnation: one was Mipam Ch√∂drup Gyamtso, the stepbrother of the 6th Panchen Lama; the other was K√∂nchok Garwang Gyatso (‡Ωë‡ΩÄ‡Ωº‡Ωì‡ºã‡Ωò‡ΩÜ‡Ωº‡ΩÇ‡ºã‡ΩÇ‡Ω¢‡ºã‡Ωë‡Ωñ‡ΩÑ‡ºã‡Ω¢‡æí‡æ±‡ºã‡Ωò‡Ωö‡Ωº) of the Namseling (‡Ω¢‡æ£‡Ωò‡ºã‡Ω¶‡æ≤‡Ω¶‡ºã‡ΩÇ‡æ≥‡Ω≤‡ΩÑ) family. The dispute was resolved by lot: Mipam Ch√∂drup Gyamtso's name was drawn and he was enthroned as the 10th Shamarpa. K√∂nchok Garwang Gyatso was referred to as the Shamar Trisur or \\"former Shamarpa\\"; according to some accounts, he \\"abdicated\\" following the lottery, implying that he had originally been enthroned. In any event, the Shamar Trisur took up residence on his family's estate at Namseling Manor, near Samye Monastery, and became a lama. Following his death ca. 1792, a reincarnation was identified, establishing a lineage known as Namling Shamar. The most recent Namling Shamar was the 5th, who was identified by the 15th Karmapa (1871‚Äì1922) and lived until 1982. Controversy In 1792 the Tibetan government found the 10th Shamarpa guilty of inciting a war between Tibet and Nepal. He was exiled from Tibet and a ban placed on his future incarnations, thereby abolishing the Shamarpa line. \\"The New York Times\\" Retrieved on December 24, 2008. A modern Tibetologist proved this interpretation of history to be wrong and showed that the Shamarpa mediated in this conflict. The comment of the Sixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa on this period was: \\"Merit was becoming smaller and smaller. There was much political interference. Black was becoming white. The real was becoming unreal. At that time it was not practicable to have any Shamarpa recognised or enthroned. Everything was kept secret. The incarnations appeared, but were not revealed.\\"Douglas Nik, White Meryl : Karmapa, the Black Hat Lama of Tibet. London, Luzac & Company Ltd., 1976, P. 151. In 1963, following a request from the 16th Karmapa, the Tibetan Government in Exile lifted the ban. \\"The Karmapa and Shamarpa Lineages\\" Retrieved on December 22, 2008. The 14th Shamar Rinpoche was officially enthroned, and after completing his studies in 1979 began his extensive teaching activity.https://www.diamondway- buddhism.org/buddhist-teachers/shamar-rinpoche/ Another controversy began in 1992, during the search for and recognition of the 17th Gyalwa Karmapa. The controversy grew to include the rights to the seat and holdings at Rumtek monastery in Sikkem, and the recognition of the reincarnated Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche. A division formed within the Karma Kagyu sangha. The two Karmapa candidates, Ogyen Trinley Dorje and Thaye Dorje issued joint statements calling for cooperation, and the wish to find the 15th Shamar Rinpoche together.https://kagyuoffice.org/joint-statement-of-his-holiness-ogyen- trinley-dorje-and-his-holiness-trinley-thaye-dorje/ 14th Shamarpa The 14th Shamarpa was Mipham Chokyi Lodro, born in Derge, Tibet in 1952. At age four he was recognized by his uncle, the 16th Karmapa, as the reincarnation of the previous Shamarpa. In 1964 he was officially enthroned in Karmapa's Rumtek monastery. At this occasion the Karmapa wrote a poem: \\"The most exalted, the lord of the lands of snow is Avalokite≈õvara. The coalescence of his essence is the glorious Karmapa. Inseparable from his three mysteries, in the manner of the three lords, Is his manifestation, the great emanation; the majestic sun, Whom I invest now sovereign of the practice lineage's order. By the power of scattering auspicious flowers of excellent virtue Combined with the true words of the ·πõi·π£hi's truthfulness May he successfully and everlastingly be the sovereign of the order.\\" Karma Trinlay Rinpoche: The 14th Shamarpa Mipham Chokyi Lodro In Loving Memory, pg. 6 He remained with the 16th Karmapa until his death in 1981. He received the entire cycle of Kagyu teachings from the 16th Karmapa. After the death of the 16th Karmapa, the Shamarpa was involved in the search for the reincarnation. He was a member of the 1992 search committee for the Karmapa's reincarnation, led by Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche. Tai Situ Rinpoche and Gyaltsab Rinpoche were also on the committee. After the Karmapa's prediction letter of his reincarnation was discovered and revealed by Tai Situ, Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche died in a mysterious accident. The Shamarpa left to the United States, and a report states the Sharmapa met with Jamgon Kongtrul's donors, instead of attending his funeral ceremonies as was traditionally expected.Enlightened Heart, \\"Tibet's Kagyu Buddhists face a leadership battle\\", 24 March 1999, https://www.karmapa.org.nz/news/15/64/Tibet-s-Kagyu-Buddhists-face-a- leadership-battle/ The search committee led by Tai Situ continued, locating then confirming the recognition of Ogyen Trinley Dorje on 07 June 1992. After the announcement of the confirmation on 12 June at Rumtek monastery, the Sharmapa entered the monastery with armed members of the Indian military, and afterwards the Indian army command denied involvement. The Sharmapa wrote two letters, on 17 June and 18 July, confirming his support for the Dalai Lama's decision to recognize Ogyen Trinley Dorje, before his enthronement as the 17th Gyalwang Karmapa on 27 September 1992, in Tibet at Tsurphu monastery. Two years later, the Sharmapa recognized Thaye Dorje as the 17th Karmapa in 1994, and enthroned him in India. His choice created a controversy for the Kagyu lineage. His choice was supported by great masters as Chobkye Tri Rinpoche, Lop√∂n Chechu Rinpoche, Lama Gend√ºn Rinpoche, the 16th Karmapa's European representative Lama Jigme Rinpoche and many others. Ogyen Trinley Dorje is held to be the 17th Karmapa by a majority of great teachers of the Karma Kagyu lineage, including the 12th Tai Situ Rinpoche, the 12th Gyaltsab Rinpoche, the 7th Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, the 9th Thrangu Rinpoche, and the 7th Mingyur Rinpoche. The head of the Sakya lineage, Sakya Trizin, also acknowledges Ogyen Trinley Dorje, as does the 14th Dalai Lama. Shamar Rinpoche died on 11 June 2014 in Germany, and a joint statement from Ogyen Trinley Dorje and Thaye Dorje was issued in 2020, which calls for a coordinated recognition process for the Sharmapa's reincarnation, in order to protect the Karma Kagyu lineage from destruction.

Pg 69 since it may reflect the method used to construct the curve as much as it reflects the observed data.  Types  =Fitting functions to data points= Most commonly, one fits a function of the form . Fitting lines and polynomial functions to data points Polynomial curves fitting points generated with a sine function. The black dotted line is the \\"true\\" data, the red line is a first degree polynomial, the green line is second degree, the orange line is third degree and the blue line is fourth degree. The first degree polynomial equation :y = ax + b\\\\; is a line with slope a. A line will connect any two points, so a first degree polynomial equation is an exact fit through any two points with distinct x coordinates. If the order of the equation is increased to a second degree polynomial, the following results: :y = ax^2 + bx + c\\\\;. This will exactly fit a simple curve to three points. If the order of the equation is increased to a third degree polynomial, the following is obtained: :y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\\\\;. This will exactly fit four points. A more general statement would be to say it will exactly fit four constraints. Each constraint can be a point, angle, or curvature (which is the reciprocal of the radius of an osculating circle). Angle and curvature constraints are most often added to the ends of a curve, and in such cases are called end conditions. Identical end conditions are frequently used to ensure a smooth transition between polynomial curves contained within a single spline. Higher-order constraints, such as \\"the change in the rate of curvature\\", could also be added. This, for example, would be useful in highway cloverleaf design to understand the rate of change of the forces applied to a car (see jerk), as it follows the cloverleaf, and to set reasonable speed limits, accordingly. The first degree polynomial equation could also be an exact fit for a single point and an angle while the third degree polynomial equation could also be an exact fit for two points, an angle constraint, and a curvature constraint. Many other combinations of constraints are possible for these and for higher order polynomial equations. If there are more than n + 1 constraints (n being the degree of the polynomial), the polynomial curve can still be run through those constraints. An exact fit to all constraints is not certain (but might happen, for example, in the case of a first degree polynomial exactly fitting three collinear points). In general, however, some method is then needed to evaluate each approximation. The least squares method is one way to compare the deviations. There are several reasons given to get an approximate fit when it is possible to simply increase the degree of the polynomial equation and get an exact match.: * Even if an exact match exists, it does not necessarily follow that it can be readily discovered. Depending on the algorithm used there may be a divergent case, where the exact fit cannot be calculated, or it might take too much computer time to find the solution. This situation might require an approximate solution. * The effect of averaging out questionable data points in a sample, rather than distorting the curve to fit them exactly, may be desirable. * Runge's phenomenon: high order polynomials can be highly oscillatory. If a curve runs through two points A and B, it would be expected that the curve would run somewhat near the midpoint of A and B, as well. This may not happen with high-order polynomial curves; they may even have values that are very large in positive or negative magnitude. With low-order polynomials, the curve is more likely to fall near the midpoint (it's even guaranteed to exactly run through the midpoint on a first degree polynomial). * Low-order polynomials tend to be smooth and high order polynomial curves tend to be \\"lumpy\\". To define this more precisely, the maximum number of inflection points possible in a polynomial curve is n-2, where n is the order of the polynomial equation. An inflection point is a location on the curve where it switches from a positive radius to negative. We can also say this is where it transitions from \\"holding water\\" to \\"shedding water\\". Note that it is only \\"possible\\" that high order polynomials will be lumpy; they could also be smooth, but there is no guarantee of this, unlike with low order polynomial curves. A fifteenth degree polynomial could have, at most, thirteen inflection points, but could also have twelve, eleven, or any number down to zero. The degree of the polynomial curve being higher than needed for an exact fit is undesirable for all the reasons listed previously for high order polynomials, but also leads to a case where there are an infinite number of solutions. For example, a first degree polynomial (a line) constrained by only a single point, instead of the usual two, would give an infinite number of solutions. This brings up the problem of how to compare and choose just one solution, which can be a problem for software and for humans, as well. For this reason, it is usually best to choose as low a degree as possible for an exact match on all constraints, and perhaps an even lower degree, if an approximate fit is acceptable. Relation between wheat yield and soil salinityCalculator for sigmoid regression Fitting other functions to data points Other types of curves, such as trigonometric functions (such as sine and cosine), may also be used, in certain cases. In spectroscopy, data may be fitted with Gaussian, Lorentzian, Voigt and related functions. In agriculture the inverted logistic sigmoid function (S-curve) is used to describe the relation between crop yield and growth factors. The blue figure was made by a sigmoid regression of data measured in farm lands. It can be seen that initially, i.e. at low soil salinity, the crop yield reduces slowly at increasing soil salinity, while thereafter the decrease progresses faster. =Algebraic fit versus geometric fit for curves= For algebraic analysis of data, \\"fitting\\" usually means trying to find the curve that minimizes the vertical (y-axis) displacement of a point from the curve (e.g., ordinary least squares). However, for graphical and image applications geometric fitting seeks to provide the best visual fit; which usually means trying to minimize the orthogonal distance to the curve (e.g., total least squares), or to otherwise include both axes of displacement of a point from the curve. Geometric fits are not popular because they usually require non-linear and/or iterative calculations, although they have the advantage of a more aesthetic and geometrically accurate result. =Fitting plane curves to data points= If a function of the form y=f(x) cannot be postulated, one can still try to fit a plane curve. Other types of curves, such as conic sections (circular, elliptical, parabolic, and hyperbolic arcs) or trigonometric functions (such as sine and cosine), may also be used, in certain cases. For example, trajectories of objects under the influence of gravity follow a parabolic path, when air resistance is ignored. Hence, matching trajectory data points to a parabolic curve would make sense. Tides follow sinusoidal patterns, hence tidal data points should be matched to a sine wave, or the sum of two sine waves of different periods, if the effects of the Moon and Sun are both considered. For a parametric curve, it is effective to fit each of its coordinates as a separate function of arc length; assuming that data points can be ordered, the chord distance may be used.p.51 in Ahlberg & Nilson (1967) The theory of splines and their applications, Academic Press, 1967 Fitting a circle by geometric fit Circle fitting with the Coope method, the points describing a circle arc, centre (1 ; 1), radius 4. different models of ellipse fitting Ellipse fitting minimising the algebraic distance (Fitzgibbon method). Coope approaches the problem of trying to find the best visual fit of circle to a set of 2D data points. The method elegantly transforms the ordinarily non-linear problem into a linear problem that can be solved without using iterative numerical methods, and is hence much faster than previous techniques. Fitting an ellipse by geometric fit The above technique is extended to general ellipsesPaul Sheer, A software assistant for manual stereo photometrology, M.Sc. thesis, 1997 by adding a non-linear step, resulting in a method that is fast, yet finds visually pleasing ellipses of arbitrary orientation and displacement. =Application to surfaces= Note that while this discussion was in terms of 2D curves, much of this logic also extends to 3D surfaces, each patch of which is defined by a net of curves in two parametric directions, typically called u and v. A surface may be composed of one or more surface patches in each direction. Software Many statistical packages such as R and numerical software such as the gnuplot, GNU Scientific Library, MLAB, Maple, MATLAB, Mathematica, GNU Octave, and SciPy include commands for doing curve fitting in a variety of scenarios. There are also programs specifically written to do curve fitting; they can be found in the lists of statistical and numerical analysis programs as well as in :Category:Regression and curve fitting software.

It is characterized by the following: *Distinctive facial appearance *Unusually sparse, brittle, curly scalp hair *A range of skin abnormalities from dermatitis to thick, scaly skin over the entire body (generalized ichthyosis) *Heart malformations (congenital or appearing later) especially an obstruction of the normal flow of blood from the lower right ventricle of the heart to the lungs (valvar pulmonary stenosis) *Delayed growth *Foot abnormalities (extra toe or fusion of two or more toes) Presentation Individuals with the disorder usually have distinctive malformations of the craniofacial area including an unusually large head (macrocephaly), prominent forehead, and abnormal narrowing of both sides of the forehead (bitemporal constriction); The nose can be upturned and short with a low nasal bridge; and large ears that are abnormally rotated toward the back of the head. In many cases, affected individuals also have downward slanting eyelid folds, widely spaced eyes, drooping of the upper eyelids, inward deviation of the eyes, and other eye abnormalities including absent eyebrows and eyelashes. Genetic  Costello and Noonan syndrome are similar to CFC and their phenotypic overlap may be due to the biochemical relationship of the genes mutated in each syndrome to each other. Genes that are mutated in all three of these syndromes encode proteins that function in the MAP kinase pathway. * Mutations that cause CFC are found in the KRAS, BRAF, MEK1 and MEK2 genes. * Costello syndrome is caused by mutations in HRAS. * Mutations that cause Noonan syndrome have been found in PTPN11 and SOS1. The relative severity of CFC when compared to Noonan syndrome may reflect the position in the biochemical pathway each gene occupies. * Shp2, the protein product of the PTPN11, appears to regulate the MAP kinase pathway at or above the level of SOS1. * SOS1 in turn regulates the activities of RAS, RAF, MEK, ERK and p90RSK. * SOS1 has been demonstrated to be a target of negative feedback by ERK and p90RSK.

While a trained and practicing architect, he is best known for his work that put live goldfish in a blender. Early life Though raised a Catholic, in his teenage years Evaristti found out he was born to a Jewish mother, which some account for the philosophical and religious themes in his work. Evaristti holds a master's degree in architecture from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts where he was a student of architect Henning Larsen. Through the years, he has continued working on private architectural projects as well as larger commission projects. Architecture His architecture works contain a blend of Scandinavian, Asian and Latin American approaches. He travels to other countries and embellishes the natural environment with coloured dye as part of an ongoing project he calls \\"Pink State\\". Evaristti sometimes uses materials taken from nature, such as diamonds, gold, semen and blood, to create a psychological reaction in the viewer. =Pink State= Evaristti describes Pink State as his own independent state, a state of mind with passport and constitution, but without government control. Although imaginary, he will materialize it from time to time in his transitory landscape works. Pink State is Evaristti's, but without controlled or controlling borders. Manifestations of Pink State have included 2004's The Ice Cube Project off Greenland, 2007's attempted painting of the summit of Mont Blanc (The Mont Rouge Project) in France, and 2008's Arido Rosso Project in the Sahara. All these projects, at their core, deal with issues of territorial power and brotherhood. Works In 1995, Evaristti was a visiting professor in Bangkok at the Silipakorn Fine Arts University. While in Bangkok, he witnessed over thirty road casualties every day, and accompanied investigators to several accidents. Here he acquired blood and other materials from some of the scenes, and used them with ink to paint on canvases. In this way, he was trying to create an image of what disaster might look like. The most important element was the use of real blood. Evaristti quoted Picasso that art is a representation of reality expressed through a lie. However, in these paintings the blood is real and thus not a lie. He titled the piece \\"Crash\\". After studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, Evaristti gained notoriety for a museum display entitled Helena in 2000 that featured ten functional blenders containing live goldfish. The display, at the Trapholt Art Museum in Kolding, Denmark, invited guests to turn on the blenders. This led to museum director Peter Meyers being charged with and, later, acquitted of animal cruelty. In 2001, Evaristti worked on his project \\"Terrorialista\\", which is a silver-patina bronze sculpture made up of twenty-eight parts that together form a complete human body. The pieces are all based on photographic images of human bodies that were blown apart by acts of terror by both sides of the conflict. The allegiances, gender, nationality, religion and every other feature that had identified the people in those photographs was now eradicated. Parts of this work are further explained in the Pink State. Evaristti's next major work, in 2004, entitled Ice Cube Project, was to paint the exposed tip of a small iceberg red. This took place on March 24, in Kangia fjord near Ilullissat, Greenland. With two icebreakers and a twenty-man crew, Evaristti used three fire hoses and 3,000 litres (790 US gallons) of paint to color the iceberg blood-red. The artist commented that, \\"We all have a need to decorate Mother Nature because it belongs to all of us.\\" On January 13, 2007, Evaristti hosted a dinner party where the main course was agnolotti pasta that was topped with a meatball made with his own fat, removed earlier in the year in a liposuction operation. On June 8, 2007, Evaristti draped the peak of Mont Blanc in France with red fabric, along with a 20-foot pole with a flag reading \\"Pink State\\". He had been arrested and detained on June 6 for attempting to paint the peak red. He has stated that his aim is to raise awareness of environmental degradation. In 2009, Evaristti exhibited his \\"Body Bags\\" project. This consisted of three body bags cast in bronze, each in a different color, to symbolize the three main monotheistic religions. He claimed the body bags were like the modern-day image of the skull and reminded people how fragile human life was. By making each resemble a different religion, he was trying to enforce the idea that no matter what ideas you believe in, your life will still end in death. On January 27, 2010, Evaristti exhibited his artwork \\"Rolexgate\\" which is a model of the entrance gate to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. 80% of the model is made up of gold which comes from the teeth of Jews who died in the concentration camps. The model had been briefly exhibited in Berlin, but was removed because of the audience reaction. In 2010, Evaristti created his \\"Boxing Bag\\" project, in which he replaced boxing bags' sand stuffing with hair cut from Christians, Jews, and Muslims.

He was one of the pioneers in studying the problem of friction, that is the resistance to motion where bodies are in contact. Life Guillaume was born in Paris, France. His father was a lawyer from Normandy who had moved to the French capital. While still young, Guillaume lost his hearing, which may have motivated him to focus entirely on science. He never attended a university, but was able to study mathematics, the physical sciences, and celestial mechanics. He also spent time studying the skills of drawing, surveying, and architecture. He died in Paris, France. Work He was supported in his research career by the government, and was employed in various public works projects. =Scientific instruments= Among his contributions to scientific instrumentation were improvements to the barometer (1695), hygrometer (1687), and thermometer (1695), particularly for use of these instruments at sea. He also demonstrated an optical telegraph and proposed the use of his clepsydraAmontons, G. (1695), Remarques et exp√©riences physiques sur la construction d'une nouvelle clepsydre, Paris. (water clock) for keeping time on a ship at sea. =Thermodynamics= Amontons investigated the relationship between pressure and temperature in gases though he lacked accurate and precise thermometers. Though his results were at best semi- quantitative, he established that the pressure of a gas increases by roughly one-third between the temperatures of cold and the boiling point of water.Amontons (20 June 1699) Moyen de substituer commodement l'action du feu, a la force des hommes et des cheveaux pour mouvoir les machines (Method of substituting the force of fire for horse and man power to move machines), M√©moires de l'Acad√©mie royale des sciences, in: Histoire de l'Acad√©mie royale des sciences, pp. 112-126. This was a substantial step towards the subsequent gas laws and, in particular, Gay-Lussac's law. His work led him to speculate that a sufficient reduction in temperature would lead to the disappearance of pressure. Though he came close to finding absolute zero - the theoretical temperature by which the volume of air in his air-thermometer will be reduced to nothing (estimated by him as ‚àí240 on the Celsius scale), the discovery would not be complete until at least a century later. Guillaume Amontons is also the inventor of the hot air engine. In 1699 he built his first engine, more than a century earlier than the well-known Stirling engine. This engine, named by Amontons a \\"fire mill\\" (moulin √† feu) followed a new thermodynamic cycle, which later became known as the Stirling cycle. The fire mill is a wheel that makes use of the expansion of heated air to generate motive power. The calculated power of Amontons' fire mill was 39 HP, equal to the power of the most powerful hot air engines of the 19th century (with the exception of the \\"caloric engine\\" of Ericsson). The main difference between Amontons' engine and the hot air engines of the 19th century was the nature of the piston (Amontons used water) and the use of rotational motion instead of alternating motion. =Friction= Free-body diagram for a block on a ramp. Arrows are vectors indicating directions and magnitudes of forces. N is the normal force, mg is the force of gravity, and Ff is the force of friction. In 1699, Amontons published his rediscovery of the laws of friction first put forward by Leonardo da Vinci.Amontons (19 December 1699) De la resistance caus√©e dans les Machines, tant par les frottemens des parties qui les composent, que par roideur des cordes qu'on y employe, & la maniere de calculer l'un & l'autre (On the resistance caused in machines, both by the rubbing of the parts that compose them and by the stiffness of the cords that one uses in them, & the way of calculating both), M√©moires de l'Acad√©mie royale des sciences, in: Histoire de l'Acad√©mie royale des sciences, pp. 206-222. Though they were received with some skepticism, the laws were verified by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb in 1781.Bowden, F.P. & Tabor, D. (1950) The Friction and Lubrication of Solids pp1, 87-89 Amontons' laws of friction Amontons' laws of friction:washington.edu, Introduction to Tribology - Friction # The force of friction is directly proportional to the applied load. (Amontons' 1st law) # The force of friction is independent of the apparent area of contact. (Amontons' 2nd law) # Kinetic friction is independent of the sliding velocity. (Coulomb's law) (These 3 laws only apply to dry friction; the addition of a lubricant modifies the tribological properties significantly.) The laws are shown by the classic example of a brick resting on an inclined plane, where it is in equilibrium and thus motionless. The force of gravity is opposed by static friction and as the angle of tilt of the plane is increased, the brick will eventually start to move downwards as gravity overcomes the frictional resistance.

Juan is also the first hurricane name and one of two to be requested to be retired by the Meteorological Service of Canada (the other being Igor of 2010). It was the tenth named storm and the sixth hurricane of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. Juan formed southeast of Bermuda on September 24 from a tropical wave that had tracked across the subtropical Atlantic Ocean. It tracked northward and strengthened over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, reaching Category 2 strength on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale on September 27\\\\. The hurricane peaked in intensity with sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) that same day, losing some strength as it raced over cooler waters toward the coast of Nova Scotia. Juan made landfall between Shad Bay and Prospect in the Halifax Regional Municipality early on September 29 as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph (160 km/h). Juan retained hurricane strength while crossing Nova Scotia from south to north, though it weakened to a Category 1 storm over Prince Edward Island. It was absorbed by another extratropical low later on September 29 near Anticosti Island in the northern Gulf of Saint Lawrence. The hurricane inflicted extensive damage across central Nova Scotia and into Prince Edward Island, with lesser damage east and west of the storm centre. Most of the damage occurred as a result of the intense winds that buffeted the region. Juan's passage resulted in eight fatalities and over CA $300 million (US$200 million) in damage. It was described as the worst storm to hit Halifax since 1893. Meteorological history A large tropical wave accompanied by a broad area of low pressure moved off the coast of Africa on September 14, 2003. It initially tracked westward and remained disorganized due to unfavourable upper-level wind shear. On September 20, the convection around the system greatly increased during interaction with the circulation of a large upper- level low, though unfavorable conditions caused the activity to remain disorganized. The system as a whole moved to the northwest around the upper- level low and developed a mid-level circulation. It interacted with a frontal zone, and became better organized on September 23 while located 450 mi (725 km) south of Bermuda. Later that day, a low-level circulation developed within the system, though its involvement with the proximate frontal zone prevented it from being classified a tropical depression. Deep convection increased near the centre on September 24, and the system quickly developed banding features and distinct outflow. Based on the increase in organization, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified it as Tropical Depression Fifteen later that day while it was located about 345 miles (555 km) southeast of Bermuda. Operationally, the agency did not initiate storm advisories until 27 hours after the time of its formation determined by post-hurricane season analysis. Initially, the depression possessed a combination of tropical and subtropical characteristics; it remained attached to a nearby frontal zone, though the organization of the convection and a warm core within the system resulted in classification as a tropical cyclone. Forecasters had predicted the depression would only slowly strengthen and reach a peak intensity of 65 mph (105 km/h). However, the depression steadily organized and had strengthened into Tropical Storm Juan by early September 25. Juan moved northwestward at around 10 mph (16 km/h) in response to a developing subtropical ridge to its east. On September 26, an eye feature developed, and very deep convection increased around the circulation. The cloud pattern continued to consolidate, and Juan attained hurricane status later on September 26 while located 165 mi (270 km) southeast of Bermuda. The hurricane moved into an area of warm waters and light wind shear, allowing for additional strengthening; by September 27, Juan had attained a peak intensity of 105 mph (165 km/h) while located 635 mi (1,020 km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. At this peak strength, the eye of the hurricane was distinct and embedded within a well-defined and round central dense overcast. Hurricane Juan making landfall in Nova Scotia on September 29 Hurricane Juan remained at peak intensity for over 24 hours. After moving northwestward for an extended period of time, it turned and accelerated to the north. The eye became less distinct on September 28, and the hurricane weakened slightly. Due to its fast forward motion, Juan had little time to weaken over significantly colder waters before making landfall between Shad Bay and Prospect (near Halifax) on September 29 with winds of 100 mph (160 km/h). It weakened quickly while rapidly moving across the southern Canadian Maritimes and crossing the Nova Scotia peninsula as a hurricane. Juan had diminished to a tropical storm as it moved over Prince Edward Island by early September 29\\\\. Later that afternoon, the storm was absorbed by a large extratropical low over the northwestern Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Preparations The first advisories were issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre on September 26, although at that time they broadly suggested the possibility existed for wind and rain across Atlantic Canada. As Juan approached on September 27, warning broadcasts on local media in Atlantic Canada were changed accordingly. The public and emergency officials in the expected landfall area were told to make preparations for a potential disaster, after the CHC bulletins indicated the possibility existed for significant wind damage and flooding from both heavy rain and storm surges, as well as power outages. On the morning of September 28, reports indicated that Juan would make landfall either as a tropical storm or marginal Category 1 hurricane. Weather broadcasts up to that time gave every indication that the storm would weaken prior to landfall. By 6 p.m. ADT (2100 UTC), additional warnings had been issued since Juan was expected to make landfall as a strong Category 1 or weak Category 2 hurricane. Most businesses in the areas affected were closed on Sundays, which meant that preparations could not be made at the last minute. Although no large-scale evacuations were made, local evacuations for low-lying areas were issued on the evening of September 28. In all, several hundred people were affected by these evacuations. Utility workers also stood on standby before the storm hit, preparing for large-scale power outages. Impact =Nova Scotia= Debris on the streets of Halifax following the hurricane Hurricane Juan's maximum sustained wind speed at landfall in Nova Scotia was measured at 100 mph (155 km/h). The urban concentration surrounding Halifax Harbour bore the brunt of the highest sustained winds and strongest wind gusts during the storm; some unofficial estimates have placed gusts as high as 145 mph (230 km/h). Wave-rider weather buoys off the entrance of Halifax Harbour snapped their moorings after reportedly recording waves in excess of 65 ft (20 m). Significant erosion occurred on the populated shores of the harbour, particularly in the Bedford Basin where residential properties and railway tracks received most of the wave action. Storm surges of 5 to 7 feet (1.5 to 2 m) were reported in the harbour; it was the highest surge ever recorded in Halifax Harbour. Rainfall was fairly light due to the fast movement and dry air on the southern side of the storm. There were no rainfall reports greater than 2 inches (52 mm). Juan caused widespread structural and vegetation damage across the region, particularly in and around the Halifax Regional Municipality. Extensive damage to trees was reported, which blocked many streets and knocked down power lines. Many homes and businesses suffered property damage, particularly roof damage on structures, and some weaker structures were destroyed. HRM estimated that 31% of residential homes suffered some degree of damage and 27% of homes had enough damage to warrant an insurance claim. In Downtown Halifax, erosion- control boulders the size of garbage cans were hurled from Halifax Harbour onto boardwalks and parking lots and piers. The Victoria General Hospital experienced roof and water damage and was evacuated during the storm, as were numerous tall apartment buildings and other multi-family residences. Billboards and signs were also destroyed, and dozens of vehicles were crushed by trees and other debris. The city's cherished Point Pleasant Park and Public Gardens suffered massive loss of trees and remained closed for months. Damage to the Halifax Public Gardens after Hurricane Juan Juan set an all-time maximum wind gust speed record at the Halifax Stanfield International Airport; during the peak of the storm, a gust reached 143 km/h, a record which still stands to this day. Another high windspeed occurred at the McNabs Island autostation, which recorded a 2-minute sustained wind of 151 km/h, with gusts to 176 km/h. Hurricane-force gusts extended as far east as Beaver Island, where gusts reached 132 km/h. The hurricane was strong enough to destroy the anemometers at Shannon Hill, Chebucto Head and Sambro Island, even though the Sambro Island instrument had survived a 193 km/h storm some years earlier.http://www.ec.gc.ca/ouragans- hurricanes/default.asp?lang=en&n;=258CBC16-1#archived The hurricane caused severe damage to shipping in Halifax Harbour. A visiting recreational schooner named Larinda was sunk at the wharf beside the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic and a harbour tour ketch Mar was driven ashore in Eastern Passage on the opposite side of Halifax Harbour. Another harbour tour vessel, the tern schooner Silva, broke from her moorings and caused extensive damage to the Cable Wharf on the Halifax Waterfront. Dozens of smaller yachts were also driven ashore; extensive damage occurred to yacht clubs in the Bedford Basin and Northwest Arm. Dozens of containers were knocked off two container ships at the South End Container Terminal. Wharves on the Halifax and Dartmouth waterfront suffered large amounts of damage and several railcars were washed into the harbour at the Dartmouth railway yard; one of the tracks for the double-track main line was washed out in several places along the Bedford Basin near Millview. Coastal flooding was also reported around Halifax Harbour as a result of the storm surge, although inland flooding was minor as rainfall was not heavy due to Juan's fast forward movement. Less severe property damage was recorded west of the storm's track into St. Margarets Bay and Mahone Bay. In addition to Halifax Regional Municipality's urban core, the town of Truro and all of rural Colchester County as well as the western part of Pictou County experienced property damage and power outages from falling trees; numerous barns and other agricultural buildings were damaged east of the storm's path, including a replica of the Hector in Pictou Harbour. The severity of property damage in the metropolitan areas of Halifax and Dartmouth of Halifax Regional Municipality initially led some forecasters to believe that Juan was likely a Category 3 hurricane; however, the sustained wind reports did not justify that suggestion. Many of the deciduous trees in central Nova Scotia still had leaves, which magnified the effects of wind damage. Overall, the number of damaged trees was estimated to be in the millions. Juan claimed six lives (two directly) in Nova Scotia. Both of the direct deaths were due to fallen trees; one was a Halifax paramedic and the other was a motorist in Enfield. Three of the four indirect deaths were as a result of a house fire started by candles when electricity was cut, and the fourth was in relief work after the storm. =Rest of Atlantic Canada= Rainfall from Hurricane Juan The storm maintained Category 1 strength as it tracked across Nova Scotia and into the Northumberland Strait, weakening to a tropical storm as it emerged into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Wind gusts of 86 mph (139 km/h) were reported in Charlottetown and 67 mph (107 km/h) in the Iles de la Madeleine in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Damage was also reported in Prince Edward Island as a result of the storm, particularly around Charlottetown, where its waterfront sustained heavy wave damage to pleasure craft and sea walls, as well as significant damage to the older urban forest in that city's downtown core. Extensive tree damage was also reported across the island, as well as structural damage to weaker buildings, such as barns and silos. The hurricane left portions of the island without power. The narrow path meant that damage was quite localized; little damage was reported in New Brunswick or western Prince Edward Island. Voting in the PEI general election on September 29 was also disrupted, though more than 80% of voters made it to polling stations. Two deaths were reported in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence off the remote Anticosti Island in Quebec. They were fishermen from New Brunswick operating near Anticosti Island. Aftermath Halifax Waterfront after Hurricane Juan In the hours following the storm a state of emergency was declared in Halifax Regional Municipality and parts of neighbouring East Hants Municipal District and Colchester County. The Government of Nova Scotia requested that the federal government deploy 600 Canadian Forces personnel to assist local authorities in HRM with cleanup in the urban area and to assist utility crews with electrical power restoration. Many utility workers, especially those employed by Nova Scotia Power and the dozens of crews from Maritime Electric and NB Power who responded under mutual assistance agreements, worked for almost three weeks without any considerable amount of rest. Many residents praised utility crews for their hard work in restoring the extensive damage. The devastated Point Pleasant Park remained closed for cleanup after the storm before re-opening in June 2004, nine months after the storm hit, with a damaged shoreline and almost 85% of its trees removed. A revitalization and reforestation program began in 2005. The Government of Nova Scotia pledged $10 million (2003 CAD) in relief money after the hurricane hit, and private contributions were also made quickly after the storm hit. Prince Edward Island also pledged $200,000 (2003 CAD) immediately after the hurricane hit, and the federal government also announced their own package. The Mayor of Toronto at the time, Mel Lastman, also contributed $50,000 (2003 CAD) to replace damaged trees in Prince Edward Island. Hurricane Juan alerted residents, governments, utilities, and emergency management agencies throughout Atlantic Canada to improve preparations for devastating events such as hurricanes, especially with climatological data pointing to possible increased frequency of major ocean storms and extratropical cyclones. In addition to Juan, three other storms ‚Äî Fabian, Isabel and Kate ‚Äî had a significant effect on land or offshore in Canada during the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. Preparations and planning have been underway since 2003 and were first tested when Hurricane Ophelia was forecast to brush near Nova Scotia in early September 2005. Hurricane Juan has also resulted in several changes to the Meteorological Service of Canada's Canadian Hurricane Centre, which has relocated from a vulnerable and exposed location in an office building in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, to a more secure location that can withstand hurricane damage. CHC's hurricane warning system has also been improved; traditionally, CHC did not issue standard hurricane or tropical storm watches or warnings, just high wind and heavy rainfall warnings, which were often not heeded by local residents. Beginning in the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, CHC began using standard hurricane warnings for storms potentially affecting Canada. Canada issued its first hurricane warning in 2008 in anticipation of Hurricane Kyle and in 2009, issued its second hurricane watch in anticipation of Hurricane Bill. Hurricane Juan lent its name to a severe blizzard that struck Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island a few months later in February 2004 which quickly became known as White Juan because the paralyzing effects of the massive snowfall evoked the recent hurricane. =Retirement= Because of its effects in Canada, the name Juan was retired in April 2004 and will never be used again for an Atlantic hurricane. Environment Canada noted that its request for retirement was \\"in consideration of the lost and damaged lives, the impact to economy, and the widespread destruction of trees throughout two provinces\\". It was the first time that the Meteorological Service of Canada had specifically requested a hurricane name be retired. The name was replaced by Joaquin for the 2009 season, but since it was not used during that year, it was used in the 2015 season, although it was later retired.

Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court that invalidated prohibitions on desecrating the American flag, which at the time were enforced in 48 of the 50 states. Justice William Brennan wrote for a five-justice majority in holding that defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Johnson was represented by attorneys David D. Cole and William Kunstler. Background of the case Johnson (to right) with attorney Kunstler, c. 1989 Gregory Lee \\"Joey\\" Johnson, then a member of the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade, participated in a political demonstration during the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas, against the Reagan Administration and certain companies based in Dallas. They marched through the streets, shouted chants, destroyed property, broke windows and threw trash, beer cans, soiled diapers and various other items, and held signs outside the offices of several companies. At one point, another demonstrator handed Johnson an American flag stolen from a flagpole outside one of the targeted buildings. When the demonstrators reached Dallas City Hall, Johnson poured kerosene on the flag and set it on fire. During the burning of the flag, demonstrators shouted such phrases as, \\"America, the red, white, and blue, we spit on you, you stand for plunder, you will go under,\\" and, \\"Reagan, Mondale, which will it be? Either one means World War III.\\" No one was hurt, but some witnesses to the flag burning said they were extremely offended. A spectator, Daniel E. Walker, gathered the remains of the flags and buried them in the backyard of his home in Fort Worth.The Center Holds: The Power Struggle Inside the Rehnquist Court, James F. Simon, page 258The American Flag: An Encyclopedia of the Stars and Stripes in U.S. History, Culture, and Law, ABC CLIO, John R. Vile, page 76Burning the Flag: The Great 1989-1990 American Flag Desecration Controversy, The Kent State University Press, Robert Justin Goldstein, page 33 Johnson was charged with violating a Texas law that prohibited vandalizing respected objects (desecration of a venerated object). He was convicted, sentenced to one year in prison, and fined $2,000. He appealed his conviction to the Fifth Court of Appeals of Texas, but he lost this appeal. On appeal to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals the court overturned his conviction, saying that the State could not punish Johnson for burning the flag because the First Amendment protects such activity as symbolic speech. The court said, \\"Recognizing that the right to differ is the centerpiece of our First Amendment freedoms, a government cannot mandate by fiat a feeling of unity in its citizens. Therefore that very same government cannot carve out a symbol of unity and prescribe a set of approved messages to be associated with that symbol.\\" The court also concluded that the flag burning in this case did not cause or threaten to cause a breach of the peace. Texas asked the Supreme Court of the United States to hear the case. In 1989, the Court handed down its decision.  The Supreme Court's decision  Justice Brennan wrote the majority opinion The opinion of the Court came down as a controversial 5‚Äì4 decision, with the majority opinion being authored by Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. and joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun, Antonin Scalia, and Anthony Kennedy. In addition to joining the majority opinion, Kennedy also authored a separate concurrence. The Court first considered the question of whether the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protected non-speech acts, since Johnson was convicted of flag desecration rather than verbal communication, and, if so, whether Johnson's burning of the flag constituted expressive conduct, which would permit him to invoke the First Amendment in challenging his conviction. The First Amendment specifically disallows the abridgment of \\"speech,\\" but the court reiterated its long recognition that its protection does not end at the spoken or written word. This was concluded based on the 1931 case Stromberg v. California,. which ruled the display of a red flag as speech, and the 1969 case Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District,. which ruled the wearing of a black armband as speech. The Court rejected \\"the view that an apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled 'speech' whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea,\\" but acknowledged that conduct may be \\"sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to fall within the scope of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\\"Johnson, 491 U.S. at 404 (citing ). In deciding whether particular conduct possesses sufficient communicative elements to bring the First Amendment into play, the court asked whether \\"an intent to convey a particularized message was present, and [whether] the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it.\\"Johnson, 491 U.S. at 404. The Court found that, under the circumstances, Johnson's burning of the flag \\"constituted expressive conduct, permitting him to invoke the First Amendment.\\"Johnson, 491 U.S. at 403. \\"Occurring as it did at the end of a demonstration coinciding with the Republican National Convention, the expressive, overtly political nature of the conduct was both intentional and overwhelmingly apparent.\\"Johnson, syllabus. The court concluded that, while \\"the government generally has a freer hand in restricting expressive conduct than it has in restricting the written or spoken word,\\" it may not \\"proscribe particular conduct because it has expressive elements.\\"Johnson, 491 U.S. at 406. Texas had conceded, however, that Johnson's conduct was expressive in nature. Thus, the key question considered by the Court was \\"whether Texas has asserted an interest in support of Johnson's conviction that is unrelated to the suppression of expression.\\"Johnson, 491 U.S. at 407. At oral argument, the state defended its statute on two grounds: first, that states had a compelling interest in preserving a venerated national symbol; and second, that the state had a compelling interest in preventing breaches of the peace. As to the \\"breach of the peace\\" justification, however, the Court found that \\"no disturbance of the peace actually occurred or threatened to occur because of Johnson's burning of the flag,\\" and Texas conceded as much.Johnson, 491 U.S. at 408. The Court rejected Texas's claim that flag burning is punishable on the basis that it \\"tends to incite\\" breaches of the peace, citing the test from the 1969 case Brandenburg v. Ohio. that the state may only punish speech that would incite \\"imminent lawless action,\\" finding that flag burning does not always pose an imminent threat of lawless action. The Court noted that Texas already punished \\"breaches of the peace\\" directly. = Kennedy's concurrence = Justice Kennedy wrote a concurrence with Brennan's opinion.Eisler, 277 Kennedy wrote: = Rehnquist's dissent = Brennan's opinion for the court generated two dissents. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, joined by Justices Byron White and Sandra Day O'Connor, argued that the \\"unique position\\" of the flag \\"justifies a governmental prohibition against flag burning in the way respondent Johnson did here.\\"Johnson, 491 U.S. at 422 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting). Rehnquist wrote: However, the Johnson majority found the lack of evidence for flag protection in the Constitution that necessitated the claim of \\"uniqueness\\" to counter indicate protection of the flag from free speech. They answered the \\"uniqueness\\" claim directly: \\"We have not recognized an exception to [bedrock First Amendment principles] even where our flag has been involved. ... There is, moreover, no indication‚Äîeither in the text of the Constitution or in our cases interpreting it‚Äîthat a separate juridical category exists for the American flag alone...We decline, therefore, to create for the flag an exception to the joust of principles protected by the First Amendment.\\" Rehnquist also argued that flag burning is \\"no essential part of any exposition of ideas\\" but rather \\"the equivalent of an inarticulate grunt or roar that, it seems fair to say, is most likely to be indulged in not to express any particular idea, but to antagonize others.\\"Johnson, 491 U.S. at 432 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting). He goes on to say that he felt the statute in question was a reasonable restriction only on the manner in which Johnson's idea was expressed, leaving Johnson with, \\"a full panoply of other symbols and every conceivable form of verbal expression to express his deep disapproval of national policy.\\" He quoted the 1984 Supreme Court decision in City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent,. where the majority stated that \\"the First Amendment does not guarantee the right to employ every conceivable method of communication at all times and in all places.\\" = Stevens' dissent = Justice John Paul Stevens also wrote a dissenting opinion. Stevens argued that the flag \\"is more than a proud symbol of the courage, the determination, and the gifts of nature that transformed 13 fledgling Colonies into a world power. It is a symbol of freedom, of equal opportunity, of religious tolerance, and of good will for other peoples who share our aspirations. . . . The value of the flag as a symbol cannot be measured.\\"Johnson, 491 U.S. at 437 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Stevens therefore concluded, \\"The case has nothing to do with 'disagreeable ideas.' It involves disagreeable conduct that, in my opinion, diminishes the value of an important national asset,\\" and that Johnson was punished only for the means by which he expressed his opinion, not the opinion itself. Subsequent developments The Court's decision invalidated laws in force in 48 of the 50 states. More than two decades later, the issue remained controversial, with polls suggesting that a majority of Americans still supported a ban on flag burning. Congress did, however, pass a statute in 1989, the Flag Protection Act, making it a federal crime to desecrate the flag. In the 1990 Supreme Court case United States v. Eichman,. that law was struck down by the same five-justice majority as in Texas v. Johnson (in an opinion also written by Brennan). Since then, Congress has considered the Flag Desecration Amendment several times. The amendment usually passes the House of Representatives, but has always been defeated in the Senate. The most recent attempt occurred when S.J.Res.12S.J.Res.12 failed by one vote on June 27, 2006. See also *Gregory Lee Johnson *Flag desecration **Street v.

The set of all solutions is known as the population. The chromosome is often represented as a binary string, although a wide variety of other data structures are also used. Chromosome design The design of the chromosome and its parameters is by necessity specific to the problem to be solved. Traditionally, chromosomes are represented in binary as strings of 0s and 1s, however other encodings are also possible; almost any representation which allows the solution to be represented as a finite-length string can be used. Finding a suitable representation of the problem domain for a chromosome is an important consideration, as a good representation will make the search easier by limiting the search space; similarly, a poorer representation will allow a larger search space. The mutation operator and crossover operator employed by the genetic algorithm must also take into account the chromosome's design. =Example 1: binary representation= Suppose the problem is to find the integer value of x between 0 and 255 that provides the maximal result for f(x) = x^2. The possible solutions for this problem are the integers from 0 to 255, which can all be represented as 8-digit binary strings. Thus, we might use an 8-digit binary string as our chromosome. If a given chromosome in the population represents the value 155, its chromosome would be \`10011011\`. Note that this is not the type of problem that is normally solved by a genetic algorithm, since it can be trivially solved using numeric methods; it is only used to serve as a simple example. =Example 2: string representation= A more realistic problem we might wish to solve is the travelling salesman problem. In this problem, we seek an ordered list of cities that results in the shortest trip for the salesman to travel. Suppose there are six cities, which we'll call A, B, C, D, E, and F. A good design for our chromosome might be the ordered list we want to try. An example chromosome we might encounter in the population might be \`DFABEC\`. Selection, crossover and mutation In each generation of the genetic algorithm, two parent chromosomes are selected based on their fitness values; these chromosomes are used by the mutation and crossover operators to produce two offspring chromosomes for the new population.

He was the son of Oakes Ames (1804‚Äì1873), a railroad tycoon behind the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) who was notably censured in the Credit Mobilier scandal for actions taken while a United States Congressman. Ames was executor of his father's estate, and took over many of his business interests. A Republican, he served as the 35th Governor of Massachusetts (1887‚Äì1890). He was a major philanthropist, especially in his hometown of Easton, which is graced by a number of architecturally significant works by H.H. Richardson as a result of his influence. Early years Oliver Ames was born in North Easton, Massachusetts on February 4, 1831, to Oakes Ames and Eveline Orville (Gilmore) Ames. His father was the owner of a shovel factory, which became the largest such business in the country. Ames was educated in the local schools, and then attended private academies in North Attleborough and Leicester.Davis, p. 384 He was briefly employed in the family's factory before enrolling in Brown University in 1851. He spent three years there, in a custom-designed program overseen by university president Francis Wayland.Roe, p. 666 Business career Ames then entered the family business, where he learned all aspects of its manufacturing processes and worked as a traveling salesman. When his grandfather Oliver died in 1863, he became a partner in the business. During the American Civil War, he oversaw the manufacturing department, introducing efficiencies in the manufacturing processes and expanding the business. During these years his grandfather, uncle, and father, in addition to expanding the shovel business, invested in railroads and other industrial concerns. Oakes Ames, Brady-Handy portrait Ames' father and uncle (also named Oliver) were leading figures in the Union Pacific, as well as principals in Cr√©dit Mobilier of America, a corporation established by Union Pacific insiders to siphon profits from the railroad construction.Klein (1997), pp. 138‚Äì139 Oakes Ames, while a member of Congress in the 1860s, sold shares of Cr√©dit Mobiler to other Congressmen, priced at par value, which was well below their estimated market value. When this was exposed in 1872, it was determined by a Congressional investigating committee to be for the purpose of influencing railroad-related legislation. The scandal resulted in his censure, and he died not long afterward.Cooper and Fenton, pp. 201‚Äì214 Ames became co-executor and heir to his father's fortune, which included a nationwide network of business interests, as well as $6‚Äì8 million in debts, most of them related to the Union Pacific and Cr√©dit Mobilier scandal. Over a period of years, Ames was able to pay off the debts, provide more than $1 million in bequests, and divide the estate amongst the heirs.Sargent, p. 913 Jay Gould, c. 1880s photo Ames's relationship with the Union Pacific (UP) took years of legal action to unwind. In 1875, financier Jay Gould obtained control of the UP, while a group of mainly Ames-dominated Boston investors retained control of Cr√©dit Mobilier (CM).Klein (2006), pp. 316‚Äì320 The latter company was mired in legal action related to the scandal, and its shares were a major component of Oakes Ames's estate. The company's only major asset was a $2 million note against UP, and Ames instigated legal action by CM to recover its value. Gould and UP countersued, offering CM shareholders equivalent UP stock in a bid to gain control over CM. This gambit largely succeeded, with most CM shareholders, including Ames's uncle, agreeing to the deal. Ames rejected the deal, and became the principal opponent to Gould's later actions.Klein (2006), pp. 321‚Äì322 Gould successfully ousted Ames from the CM board, which (under Gould's control) then voted to discontinue its lawsuit. Ames launched legal action as a shareholder, and succeeded in forcing CM into receivership in 1879, with himself as the receiver.Klein (2006), pp. 404‚Äì405 The legal wrangling continued until 1880, with most of the holdout shareholders eventually being bought out by Gould for $20/share plus costs.Klein (2006), pp. 547‚Äì549 During the legal wrangling over the UP, Ames scored a significant business coup with Gould. In the 1860s, Ames acquired (for a low price) a controlling interest in the Central Branch Union Pacific Railroad, a paper railroad, separate from the UP, which was chartered to provided service in Kansas. In the late 1870s, he personally oversaw the acquisition of rights of way and construction of the railroad. He sold it to Gould, who was assembling pieces of a full transcontinental rail network under the UP umbrella,Klein (2006), p. 411 for $250/share. Political career Ames entered public life with the stated intent to vindicate his father's memory. His early political activities included sitting on Easton's School Committee, and chairing the local Republican Party committee. He decided to run for state senate in 1879, after he was unsuccessful in securing passage for the separation of the Martha's Vineyard community of Cottage City, where he owned a summer house, from Edgartown.Cutter, p. 331 Winning election, he saw through the incorporation of the town (now known as Oak Bluffs).Davis, p. 385 He also sat on the committees overseeing railroads and schools. In 1882, Ames received the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts, alongside gubernatorial nominee Senate President Robert R. Bishop. In a bitterly divisive contest dominated by issues of corruption at the national level, and temperance at the local level, Democrat Benjamin Butler defeated Bishop, but Ames won his race.Bishop, pp. 7‚Äì9 Ames served from 1883 to 1886, first under Butler (for one term) and then George D. Robinson (for three). In 1883, the Massachusetts legislature passed a resolution exonerating his father, and called on Congress to reverse the censure.Clarke, p. 189 During this period he also oversaw the sale by the state of its interests in the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and the Hoosac Tunnel. He was at first criticized for the relatively low price (shares were sold at 1/3 of par value), but it was later seen to be a good deal. With Governor Robinson retiring in 1886, Ames won election as Governor of Massachusetts, and served three lackluster one-year terms. One of the major political issues in his first two races was his lack of service in the American Civil War. Ames had served in the state militia before the war, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel, but resigned before the war began. Ames countered criticisms by pointing out that he had hired a substitute to serve in his place, and that he had financially supported the Union war effort.Purcell, pp. 254‚Äì255 William E. Russell, portrait by William Morton Jackson Rice As governor, Ames was a competent administrator, hiring and promoting more on the basis of merit than politics. He advocated the improvement of public schools, as a counter to private religious schools. In his second term, he donated $1,000 to the College of the Holy Cross, which upset anti-Catholics in the state and cost him votes in the third election against William E. Russell. He was also unpopular with advocates of temperance; although he supported the work of the Massachusetts Temperance Society, he was opposed to the legislated prohibition of alcohol.Purcell, p. 255 A state constitutional amendment enacting prohibition was passed by the legislature in 1889, but was voted down in the required referendum that followed.Hennessy, p. 4 A project to expand the Massachusetts State House was approved during his tenure, and he in 1889 helped lay the cornerstone for its new elements. In 1887 he signed a bill exempting military veterans from recently enacted civil service regulations, earning him the ire of the state's progressives.The Nation, June 23, 1887 In 1888, his health began to fail, probably due to the strain of office and his business interests. He refused to run for reelection in 1889, continuing a party tradition of three-term governors. After leaving office, he traveled to Europe several times to relax and recover his health.Davis, p. 386 He died at his North Easton home in 1895.Davis, p. 387 Family, patronage, and legacy Ames married Anna Coffin Ray of Nantucket in 1860. The couple had six children; Oakes Ames (1874‚Äì1950), their youngest son, was a well-known American botanist and orchid expert.Ulrich et al, p. 42 He owned palatial properties in Boston, Martha's Vineyard, and North Easton. Ames was elected an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity in 1917, by the fraternity's Alpha Chapter at the New England Conservatory in Boston. He is the only known member to receive such a posthumous offer. Easton's public high school (of which he was a major financial backer)Purcell, p. 256 is named Oliver Ames High School in his honor. He is also the namesake of the small community of Oliver, Nebraska,Fitzpatrick, p. 87 and of the schooner Governor Ames, one of largest wooden sailing vessels built in the 19th century, and the first oceangoing five-masted schooner on the Atlantic coast (Ames was one the investors in the ship).Grenon Together with his cousin Frederick Lothrop Ames, Oliver financed many important buildings and landscapes in North Easton designed by architect H. H. Richardson and landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted. Notable among these are Oakes Ames Memorial Hall and the Ames Free Library, centerpieces of the H. H. Richardson Historic District of North Easton, a National Historic Landmark District. He was also a patron of sports and the arts, owning Booth's Theatre in New York City, and raising funds to send athletes from the Boston Athletic Association to the 1896 Summer Olympics.

Biography Ames was born in Boston, Massachusetts on June 22, 1846. He received his primary education in Boston, then graduated from Harvard College in 1868, and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1872. He began working as a tutor and instructor at Harvard in 1871, and continued until 1873, when he was admitted to the bar. Although a licensed lawyer, Ames did not open a private practice, spending his full-time at Harvard during his entire career, as tutor, instructor, assistant professor, full professor, and dean of the Law School. Ames married Sarah Russell (born September 22, 1851) on June 28, 1880. He died on January 8, 1910. Harvard legal career Ames has been called the foremost teacher of law of his time, being not only an exceptionally broad and accurate scholar, and a profound student of the history of common law, but also having special ability in the development of clear and exact thought in those under his instruction.The Descendants of John Heywood ‚Äì Biography of James Barr Ames, LL.D., From The history of New Ipswich, New Hampshire, 1735‚Äì1914... (by Charles H. Chandler, Sentinel Print. Co., Fitchburg MA, 1914) In teaching law to his Harvard students, Ames used actual legal cases to illustrate legal principles, a concept which had been developed by Christopher Columbus Langdell. Ames insisted that legal education should require the study of actual cases instead of abstract principles of law. He was instrumental in introducing the case method in the teaching of law, a method which had come into general use in US law schools at the time of his death, and which continues to the present. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1878. He served as dean of Harvard Law School from 1895 to 1910. He was a manager of the 1907-founded Comparative Law Bureau of the American Bar Association, whose Annual Bulletin was the first comparative law journal in the U.S. Ames had received the degree of LL.D. from six universities by the time of his passing.

Ristretto is a \\"short shot\\" (30 ml from a double basket) of a more highly concentrated espresso coffee. It is made with the same amount of ground coffee, but extracted with a finer grind (also in from 20 to 30 seconds) using half as much water. A normal short shot might look like a Ristretto, but in reality, would only be a weaker, more diluted, shot.Realcoffee.co.uk, Glossary, R The opposite of a Ristretto (which means in Italian, \\"shortened, narrow\\") is a lungo (\\"long\\"), which is a double shot. The French call a ristretto a caf√© serr√©. Regardless of whether one uses a hand pressed machine or an automatic, a regular double shot is generally considered to be around 14‚Äì18 grams of ground coffee extracted into 60 ml (2 fl oz or two shot glasses).SeattleCoffeeGear.com, ‚ÄúHow Much to Grind for a Double Shot of Espresso?‚Äù Thus, a \\"double ristretto\\" consumes the same amount of coffee beans but fills only a single shot glass. Coffee contains over a thousand aroma compounds.Royal Society of Chemistry, \\"Chemistry in every cup\\" A ristretto's chemical composition and taste differ from those of a full length extraction for three reasons: # More concentrated: The first part of any extraction is the most concentrated, its color typically lying between dark chocolate and umber, whereas the tail end of shots are much lighter, varying from the color of dark pumpkin pie to varying shades of tan (see photo, above right). This is an important factor when drinking straight espresso shots. # Different balance: Different chemical compounds in ground coffee dissolve into hot water at different rates. A ristretto contains a greater relative proportion of faster extracting compounds, proportionally fewer of the compounds characteristic of over-extraction, and thus, a different balance. # Fewer total extracts: Relative proportions aside, fewer total coffee compounds‚Äîcaffeine being just one‚Äîare extracted into ristrettos versus full length shots. This is an important factor when diluting shots into water or milk. Straight ristrettos‚Äîshots that are traditionally drunk from a demitasse and not diluted into a larger cup containing milk or water‚Äîcould be described as bolder, fuller, with more body and less bitterness. These characteristics are usually attributed to espresso in general but are more pronounced in a ristretto. Diluted into a cup of water (e.g. Americano or long black) or milk (e.g. latte or cappuccino), ristrettos are less bitter and exhibit a more intense ‚Äúespresso‚Äù character.

A stationary blender consists of a blender container with a rotating metal blade at the bottom, powered by an electric motor that is in the base. Some powerful models can also crush ice and other frozen foods. The newer immersion blender configuration has a motor on top connected by a shaft to a rotating blade at the bottom, which can be used with any container. Characteristics Different blenders have different functions and features but product testing indicates that many blenders, even the less expensive ones, are useful for meeting many consumer needs. Features which consumers consider when purchasing a blender include the following: *large visible measurement marks *ease of use *low noise during usage *power usage (typically 300‚Äì1000 watts) *ease of cleaning *option for quick \\"pulse\\" blending =Countertop blenders= Countertop blenders use a 1‚Äì2 liters (4‚Äì8 cups) blending container made of glass, plastic, stainless steel. Glass blenders are heavier and more stable. Plastic is prone to scratching and absorbing the smell of blended food. Stainless steel is preferred for its looks, but limits visibility of the food as it is blended. Countertop blenders typically offer 3‚Äì16 speed settings, but having more choices in speed settings is not an indication of increased utility for all users. In cases where the blades are removable, the container should have an O-ring or gasket between the body of the container and the base to seal the container and prevent the contents from leaking. The blending container is generally shaped in a way that encourages material to circulate through the blades, rather than simply spinning around. The container rests upon a base that contains a motor for turning the blade assembly and has controls on its surface. Most modern blenders offer a number of possible speeds. Low-powered blenders require the addition of some liquid to operate correctly. In these blenders, the liquid helps move the solids around the jar, bringing them in contact with the blades. The blades create a whirlpool effect which moves solids from top to bottom, ensuring even contact with the blade. This creates a homogeneous mixture. High-powered blenders are capable of milling grains and crushing ice without such assistance. =Immersion blenders= An immersion blender The hand-held immersion blender, stick blender, hand blender or wand blender has no container of its own, but instead has a mixing head with rotating blades that can be immersed in a container. Immersion blenders are convenient for homogenizing volumes that are too large to fit in the bowl of a stationary blender or as in the case of soups, are too hot to be safely poured into the bowl. The operation of an immersion blender requires that the user hold down a switch for as long as the blades operate, which can be tiresome for the user. Handheld blenders are ideal for small and specific tasks but do not have as many uses as a countertop blender.  Applications  Countertop blenders are designed to mix, pur√©e, and chop food. Their strength is such that the ability to crush ice is an expected feature. Blenders are used both in home and commercial kitchens for various purposes, including to: * Grind semi-solid ingredients, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, into smooth pur√©es * Blend ice cream, milk, and sweet sauces to make milkshakes * Mix and crush ice in cocktails such as the Zombie, pi√±a colada and frozen margarita * Crush ice and other ingredients in non-alcoholic drinks such as frappuccinos and smoothies * Emulsify mixtures * Reduce small solids such as spices and seeds to smaller solids or completely powder or nut butter * Blend mixtures of powders, granules, and/or liquids thoroughly * Help dissolve solids into liquids Blenders also have a variety of applications in microbiology and food science. In addition to standard food-type blenders, there is a variety of other configurations of blender for laboratories.  Development  = North America = The Polish-American chemist Stephen Poplawski, owner of the Stevens Electric Company, began designing drink mixers in 1919 under a contract with Arnold Electric Company, and patented the drink mixer in 1922 which had been designed to make Horlicks malted milkshakes at soda fountains. He also introduced the liquefier blender in 1922. In the 1930s, L. Hamilton, Chester Beach and Fred Osius, produced Poplawski's invention under the brand name Hamilton Beach Company. Fred Osius improved the appliance, making another kind of blender. He approached Fred Waring, a popular musician, who financed and promoted the \\"Miracle Mixer\\", released in 1933. However the appliance had some problems to be solved about the seal of the jar and the knife axis, so Fred Waring redesigned the appliance and released his own blender in 1937, the Waring Blendor with which Waring popularized the smoothie in the 1940s. Waring Products was sold to Dynamics Corporation of America in 1957 and was acquired by Conair in 1998. Waring long used the trademarked spelling \\"Blendor\\" for its product; the trademark has expired. Also in 1937, W.G. Barnard, founder of Vitamix, introduced a product called \\"The Blender,\\" which was functionally a reinforced blender with a stainless steel jar, instead of the Pyrex glass jar used by Waring. In 1946 John Oster, owner of the Oster barber equipment company, bought Stevens Electric Co. and designed its own blender, which Oster commercialized under the trademark Osterizer. Oster was bought by Sunbeam Products in 1960. which released various types of blenders, as the Imperial series and still make the traditional Osterizer blender. = Europe = An electric centrifugal juicer In Europe, the Swiss Traugott Oertli developed a blender based on the technical construction and design style conception of the first Waring Blendor (1937-1942), releasing in 1943 the Turmix Standmixer. Based on the blender, Traugott also developed another kind of appliance to extract juice of any juicy fruit or vegetables, the Turmix Juicer, which was also available as separated accessory for use in the Turmix blender, the juicer Turmix Junior. had promoted the benefits of drinking natural juices made with fruits and vegetables, with recipes using juices to promote its blender and juicer. After the World War II other companies released more blender in Europe; the first one was the popular Starmix Standmixer (1948), from the Germany company Electrostar, which had numerous accessories, like a coffee grinder, cake mixer, ice cream maker, food processor, thermic jar, milk centrifugue, juicer and meat grinder; and the Braun Multimix (1950) from Max Braun, which had an attachment with glass bowl to make batter bread and a juicer centrifuge like the one developed by Turmix. = South America = In Brazil, Waldemar Clemente, ex-staffer of General Electric and owner of Walita electric appliance company since 1939, designed a blender based on the Turmix Standmixer and released in 1944 the Walita Neutron blender. Clemente also created the name liquidificador, which ever since designated a blender in Brazil. Soon thereafter, Walita acquired the Turmix patents in Brazil and also released the Turmix juicer, calling it the Centr√≠fuga Walita as well the others Turmix accessories for use with the blender motor, as fruit peelers, grinder, crusher and batter mixer. Using the same marketing strategy as Turmix in Europe, Walita passed the million-blenders-sold mark a few years later in the early 1950s. Walita were the first manufacturer to release a wide range of blenders in the 1940s. In the 1950s, Walita made blenders for Siemens, Turmix, Philips, and Sears (Kenmore), among others. In the 1960s Royal Philips Co. approached Walita, acquiring the company in 1971, becoming Royal Philips' kitchen appliances developer division specializing in blenders, which are sold under the Philips brand outside Brazil. The Austrian immigrant Hanz Arno, owner of an electric motor manufacturer in Brazil since the 1940s, released a blender in 1947, based on the blenders made by Hamilton Beach and Oster. The Liquidificador Arno was exported to other South American countries. As Arno had stocks of Electrolux, that brand was used on the blender in some countries. Later in 1997 Arno was bought by the Groupe SEB, owner of Moulinex, T-Fal, Rowenta, and other home appliance brands. = Increased versatility = With the rising popularity of smoothies, Frappucinos and other frozen drinks prepared in front of the customer, new models of commercial blenders often include a sound-reducing enclosures and computerized controls. Specialized blenders for making smoothies are becoming popular, chiefly resembling an ordinary model with a spigot added for quick serving. Some models also feature a gimballed stirring rod mounted on the lid, constructed so that mixtures can be stirred whilst the machine is running with no chance of the stirrer fouling the blades. In 1996 Tom Dickson, founder and CEO of Blendtec, introduced the WildSide blending jar ‚Äî a unique design that eliminated the need for stir sticks and plungers to make thicker blends. The technology was so effective that Vita-Mix decided to use the design in the company's commercial blending containers. In 2010 the United States court system concluded that Vita-Mix had willfully infringed the patents, ultimately awarding Blendtec $24 million in damages.  Mechanical operation  A blender consists of a housing, motor, blades, and food container. A fan-cooled electric motor is secured into the housing by way of vibration dampers, and a small output shaft penetrates the upper housing and meshes with the blade assembly. Usually, a small rubber washer provides a seal around the output shaft to prevent liquid from entering the motor. Most blenders today have multiple speeds. As a typical blender has no gearbox, the multiple speeds are often implemented using a universal motor with multiple stator windings and/or multi-tapped stator windings; in a blender with electromechanical controls, the button (or other electrical switching device or position) for each different speed connects a different stator winding/tap or combination thereof. Each different combination of energized windings produces a different torque from the motor, which yields a different equilibrium speed in balance against the drag (resistance to rotation) of the blade assembly in contact with the material inside the food container. A notable exception from the mid-1960s is the Oster Model 412 Classic VIII (with the single knob) providing the lowest speed (Stir) using the aforementioned winding tap method but furnishing higher speeds (the continuously variable higher speed range is marked Puree to Liquify) by means of a mechanical speed governor that balances the force provided by flyweights against a spring force varied by the control knob when it is switched into the higher speed range. With this arrangement, when not set to the Stir speed, motor speed is constant even with varying load up to the point where power demanded by the load is equal to the motor's power capability at a particular speed. The more modern version of this arrangement is electronic speed control found on some units. In culture In 1949 the company Vitamix advertised their blender in one of the first television infomercials. The sales pitch lasted for 25 minutes, suggesting that the blender be used to make bread crumbs, potato pancakes, laxative spinach drinks, and a dessert beverage featuring entire raw eggs and their shells, which the host announced would be enjoyed like malted milk.

Establishment At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 Lord Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War, believed that overwhelming manpower was the key to winning the war, and set about looking for ways to encourage men of all classes to join. This concept stood in direct contrast to centuries of British military tradition, in which the British Army had always relied on professional, rather than conscript, soldiers, and had drawn its members from either the gentry (for officers) or the lower classes (for enlisted men). General Sir Henry Rawlinson suggested that men would be more inclined to enlist in the Army if they knew that they were going to serve alongside their friends and colleagues. He appealed to London stockbrokers to raise a battalion of men from workers in the City of London to set an example. Sixteen hundred men enlisted in this 10th (Service) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, the so-called \\"Stockbrokers' Battalion\\", within a week in late August 1914. Inspection of the Liverpool Pals, 1915 A few days later, the Earl of Derby decided to raise a battalion of men from Liverpool. Within two days, 1,500 Liverpudlians had joined the new battalion. Speaking to these men Lord Derby said: \\"This should be a battalion of pals, a battalion in which friends from the same office will fight shoulder to shoulder for the honour of Britain and the credit of Liverpool.\\" Within the next few days, three more battalions were raised in Liverpool, forming the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th Battalions of the King's Regiment (Liverpool). Encouraged by Lord Derby's success, Kitchener promoted the idea of organising similar recruitment campaigns throughout the entire country. By the end of September 1914, more than fifty towns had formed Pals battalions, whilst the larger towns and cities were able to form several battalions each; Manchester, for example, raised four battalions in August, and four more in November. From the perspective of the War Office, the Pals battalion experiment relieved the heavy strain on the recruiting structure of a suddenly expanded regular army as well as easing the financial strain. In September 1914 Kitchener announced that the organizers of locally raised units would have to meet the initial accommodation and other costs involved, until the War Office took over their management. Accordingly, many recruits for the new Pals battalions were initially able to live at home while reporting for daily basic training. Examples The \\"Grimsby Chums\\" was formed by former schoolboys of Wintringham Secondary School in Grimsby. Many other schools, including some of the leading public schools, also formed battalions. Several sportsmen's battalions were formed, including three battalions of footballers: 17th and 23rd (Service) Battalions, Middlesex Regiment, and 16th (2nd Edinburgh) (Service) Battalion, Royal Scots, the last-mentioned battalion containing the entire first and reserve team players, several boardroom and staff members, and a sizable contingent of supporters of Scottish professional club Heart of Midlothian F.C.War Memorial Site Out of nearly 1,000 battalions raised during the first two years of the war, 145 Service and seventy Reserve infantry units were locally raised Pals battalions. Some Pals battalions were trade/social-background linked rather than area linked, such as artists' battalions and sportsmen's battalions. Professional golfers Albert Tingey, Sr., Charles Mayo, and James Bradbeer joined Pals battalions. The 17th and 32nd Battalions, Northumberland Fusiliers were almost entirely created from the ranks of the North Eastern Railway (United Kingdom). For members who joined the battalions, the North Eastern Railway gave some offers including; provisions for wives and dependants; to keep men's positions open; to pay their contribution to the Superannuation and Pensions and to provide accommodation for the families who were occupying company houses. Roles While the majority of Pals units were infantry battalions, local initiatives resulted in the raising of forty-eight companies of engineers, forty-two batteries of field artillery and eleven ammunition columns, drawn mainly from groups with common occupational backgrounds. The relatively high skills and educational levels of many Pals battalions meant an outflow of potential officers for commissioning elsewhere, from 1915 on. Casualties A commemorative plaque for the Preston Pals Many of these locally raised battalions suffered heavy casualties during the Somme offensives of 1916. A notable example was the 11th (Service) Battalion (Accrington), East Lancashire Regiment, better known as the Accrington Pals. The Accrington Pals were ordered to attack Serre, the most northerly part of the main assault, on the opening day of the battle. The Accrington Pals were accompanied by Pals battalions drawn from Sheffield, Leeds, Barnsley, and Bradford. Of an estimated 700 Accrington Pals who took part in the attack, 235 were killed and 350 wounded within the space of twenty minutes. Despite repeated attempts, Serre was not taken until February 1917, at which time the German Army had evacuated to the Hindenburg Line. Termination of regional or group recruiting The Battle of the Somme marked a turning point in the Pals battalion experiment. Many were disbanded or amalgamated after the scheme effectively came to an end following the summer of 1916. Others retained their titles until the end of the war but with recruitment dependent upon drafts from a common pool of conscripts rather than from those with regional or other common ties. The practice of drawing recruits from a particular region or group meant that, when a \\"Pals battalion\\" suffered heavy casualties, the impact on individual towns, villages, neighborhoods, and communities back in Britain could be immediate and devastating. As an example, The Sheffield City Battalion (12th York and Lancaster Regiment) had lost 495 dead and wounded in one day on the Somme and was brought back to strength by October only by drafts from diverse areas. With the introduction of conscription in March 1916, further Pals battalions were not sought. Voluntary local recruitment outside the regular army structure, so characteristic of the atmosphere of 1914‚Äì15, was not repeated in World War II.

In addition to serving as Prime Minister, he became Minister of Foreign Affairs on January 6, 2005. Spencer's party was swept from power in the June 2014 general election. Political career =Leader of the Opposition= Baldwin Spencer is rooted in labour. For a quarter-century, he was a prominent labour leader with the Antigua and Barbuda Workers Union. He was first elected to Parliament in 1989 as the MP for the St. John's Rural West constituency. In 1992, Spencer played an integral role in the formation of the United Progressive Party. He previously served as a leader with the United National Democratic Party and spearheaded collaborative meetings with the Antigua Caribbean Liberation Movement that resulted in the formation of the United Progressive Party. Upon formation of the party, Spencer rose to become the political leader of the party and the Opposition Leader in the Parliament. As Opposition Leader Baldwin Spencer organized public demonstrations and went on a hunger strike to advocate for electoral reform after the widely criticized 1999 elections. His advocacy led to the formation of an independent Electoral Commission to oversee elections in Antigua and Barbuda. He also led the fight to ensure that opposition had access to state-owned media, such as the television station, Antigua Broadcasting Service (ABS). To that end, he filed a writ and took the Bird Government to court arguing that, in a democratic society, citizens have a right to hear an opposing political perspective on government airwaves. =Prime minister= Spencer with the President of Brazil, Lula da Silva. In 2004, Baldwin Spencer led the United Progressive Party to a landslide victory in the general election. He defeated Lester Bird's ALP, which had ruled Antigua and Barbuda for the previous 28 years. In Government he moved to enact a trio of good government reforms: a nationwide school meals programme, raising the minimum wage and paying all civil servants. Internationally Baldwin Spencer is known as a skilled diplomat who helped his country assume the leadership of the Group of 77 in 2008. He received the highest order of Cote d'Ivoire, the Commander of the National Order. He was also recognized by the United Nations for his leadership, receiving the Millennium Development Goals Achievement Award in recognition for his work advancing the cause of international development.UPP biography The UPP won the March 2009 election with a reduced majority of nine out of 17 seats. Spencer himself defeated ALP candidate Gail Christian in the St John's Rural West constituency, receiving 2,259 votes against 1,753 for Christian. Spencer said on this occasion that it would \\"not be business as usual\\", and he was promptly sworn in for another term as Prime Minister when vote counting was completed.\\"UPP wins, but Bird back in parliament\\", Caribbean360.com, 13 March 2009. After 10 years in power, the UPP was defeated by the ALP in the general election held on 12 June 2014. Out of 17 seats, the UPP retained only three; Spencer won re-election to his own seat by a very narrow margin. Spencer accepted defeat, saying that the people had clearly chosen the ALP.

A rescue robot is a robot that is made to help the humans in areas that have been hit by a natural disaster such as an earthquake, tsunami, etc., or by a man-made disaster such as fires, car crashes, etc. There are many different types of rescue robots of different sizes and shapes. The , sometimes referred to as \\"HyperRescueRobot\\", is a hydraulically operated robot, built to cut a path through debris for rescue workers, in the wake of an earthquake or other catastrophe. As of 2006, the robot conducted a performance test at Nagaoka University of Technology and successfully lifted a car from a snowbank. TMSUK developed the robot in cooperation with Kyoto University, the Kitakyushu Fire Department and Japan's National Research Institute of Fire and Disaster in Tokyo. The 3.5-metre-tall robot can either be driven from a cockpit positioned at the front of the robot or it can be controlled remotely as like its cousin the Banryu, it contains multiple CCD cameras which transmit to the remote driver - in this case, it has seven 6.8-megapixel CCD cams mounted on its \\"head\\", \\"torso\\" and \\"arms\\".  Characteristics of T-52 Enryu  T-52 Enryu measures 3.5 meters in height, 2.4 meters in width, and weights 5 tons. It has two 6-meter arms. Each arm could carry 500 kilograms and both arms combined can lift up to one ton. The robot runs on diesel fuel. It has a top speed of 3 km/hr which is equivalent to most construction machines. The Robot does not have a program installed in it, need to be taught how to operate, or has any sensors to help it see because the human controls it. It does have a camera to help the human see where it is going when the human is using a remote to control it.  History  T-52 Enryu was created by the TMSUK company in Munakata-City, Fukuoka, Japan. Founded in 2000, TMSUK has 20 employees. The T-52 was created in 2004. The urge to build such advanced rescue robots begun after experts realized the amount of damage natural disasters did in the past decade alone. According to the Centre for Research on Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) there was 3852 disasters in the last decade in which over three quarters of a million of people died, and cost an amount $960 billion to fix damaged buildings and help people pay their hospital bills.  Operation  There is two methods to operate the T-52 Enryu: Operator sitting inside the robot and by remote control device. In the first method, the driver has to climb inside the robot and manually control it just like if it was a construction machine. The downside of this method is that in some cases, it is too dangerous for a person to be inside the robot because other building could collapse onto the robot and smash it, or in case of a car crash, there could be the risk of explosions.[ The second method is using a control remote to direct T-52 Enryu. When it comes to controlling the robot with the remote control device there is two options: 1.) Master-slave control: This method directly transmits the moves of the human to the machine from a control center which gives the machine a more human-like motion. Since the operator does not have to be inside the robot to control it, this method is very efficient when there is danger of further collapse in the damaged area. 2.) Joystick control: This method is used when a more precise motion is needed. This method allows the control of single joints of the robot making it more precise than that of master-slave control.  T-52 Enryu in action  The T-52 Enryu is used to lift heavy objects in areas damaged due to a natural disaster or car crashes. It can cut through metals and other materials to free people who are trapped. Also it helps clear the road for other vehicles to pass through. Last, T-52 Enryu can rip doors from cars to allow people to exit. It is mostly used in areas where it might be too dangerous for people to go to.

The production design gives the viewers a sense of the time period, the plot location, and character actions and feelings. Working directly with the director, cinematographer, and producer, production designers have a key creative role in the creation of motion pictures and television. The term production designer was coined by William Cameron Menzies while he was working on the film Gone with the Wind. Production designers are commonly confused with art directors as the roles have similar responsibilities. Production designers decide the visual concept and deal with the many and varied logistics of filmmaking including, schedules, budgets, and staffing. Art directors manage the process of making the visuals, which is done by graphic designers, set designers, costume designers, lighting designers, etc. The production designer and the art director lead a team of individuals to assist with the visual component of the film. Depending on the size of the production the rest of the team can include set decorators, buyers, dressers, runners, graphic designers, draftspeople, props makers, and set builders.  Process  # The production designer will read the script and allocate categories based on the required visual components such as interior, exterior, location, graphic, vehicles, etc. Discussion with the director is essential in the beginning of the production design process. In this discussion, the production designer will clarify the approach and focus required for the visual design of each scene. # The production designer will move to researching which is important in every design process. They will use mood board which consists of images, sketches, inspiration, color swatches, photos, textiles, etc. that help with the ideation. Learning about the time period, the place and the culture also assists with coming up with an idea. Moreover, the PD has to plan to create a convincing space within a budget, therefore, it is important that the space can speak about the character or enhance the flow of the story, rather than being filled with unnecessary decoration. Additionally, it also affects the location of filming, whether it is in a studio or at a specific location. # The production designer will ensure that  The importance of production design  Production design plays an essential role in storytelling, for instance, in the movie Titanic, when the characters Jack and Rose are in the cold water after the ship sank, we know that they are cold because of the setting: it is nighttime and there is ice on their hair. A more specific example is The Wizard of Oz, in which we know the story takes place on a farm because of the bale of hay Dorothy leans on and the animals around, as well as the typical wooden fence. In the scene in which Dorothy‚Äôs dog is taken away, we know that it happens in her aunt and uncle‚Äôs house, which adds more tension because her beloved friend, Toto is not killed, lost or kidnapped on the street, but is forced to leave by an outsider, Ms. Gulch, who enters Dorothy‚Äôs private and safe zone (her home). Jane Barnwell states that the place the characters exist in gives information about them and enhances the fluency of the narrative (175). Imagine Dorothy‚Äôs home was dirty and everyone in her house were dressed untidily, the viewer would have supported the outsider instead, perhaps thinking that the outsider in a way, rescued the dog from an unhealthy environment. Additionally, the characters‚Äô clothing, especially that of Ms. Gulch, makes the description ‚Äúown half the county‚Äù more reliable in portraying Ms. Gulch, and also supports the reason why Dorothy cannot rebel against Ms. Gulch by making the dog stay. However, this does not mean that the setting or costume should be extremely detailed and cluttered with information. The goal is to not let the viewer notice these elements, which, however, is how production design works. Jon Boorstin states in his book, Making Movies Work Thinking Like a Filmmaker, that the background, the camera motion or even the sound effect is considered well-done if the viewer does not notice their appearance.  Societies and trade organizations  In the United States and British Columbia, production designers are represented by several local unions of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE). Local 800, the Art Directors Guild, represents production designers in the U.S., with the exception of New York City and its vicinity. Those members are represented by Local 829, the United Scenic Artists. In the rest of Canada, production designers are represented by the Director's Guild of Canada. In the United Kingdom, members of the art department are represented by the non-union British Film Designers Guild. The production design credit must be requested by a film's producer, prior to completion of photography, and submitted to the Art Directors Guild Board of Directors for the credit approval.

Written in Danish‚Äîthe common written language of Denmark and Norway in Ibsen's lifetime‚Äîit is one of the most widely performed Norwegian plays. Ibsen believed Per Gynt, the Norwegian fairy tale on which the play is loosely based, to be rooted in fact, and several of the characters are modelled after Ibsen's own family, notably his parents Knud Ibsen and Marichen Altenburg. He was also generally inspired by Peter Christen Asbj√∏rnsen's collection of Norwegian fairy tales, published in 1845 (Huldre- Eventyr og Folkesagn). Peer Gynt chronicles the journey of its titular character from the Norwegian mountains to the North African desert. According to Klaus Van Den Berg, \\"its origins are romantic, but the play also anticipates the fragmentations of emerging modernism\\" and the \\"cinematic script blends poetry with social satire and realistic scenes with surreal ones.\\"Klaus Van Den Berg, \\"Peer Gynt\\" (review), Theatre Journal 58.4 (2006) 684‚Äì687 Peer Gynt has also been described as the story of a life based on procrastination and avoidance.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 391) and Meyer (1974, 284). The play was written in Italy and a first edition of 1,250 copies was published on 14 November 1867 by the Danish publisher Gyldendal in Copenhagen.Meyer (1974, 284). Although the first edition swiftly sold out, a reprint of two thousand copies, which followed after only fourteen days, didn't sell out until seven years later.Meyer (1974, 288). While Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson admired the play's \\"satire on Norwegian egotism, narrowness, and self-sufficiency\\" and described it as \\"magnificent\\",Leverson, Michael, Henrik Ibsen: The farewell to poetry, 1864‚Äì1882, Hart-Davis, 1967 p. 67 Hans Christian Andersen, Georg Brandes and Clemens Petersen all joined the widespread hostility, Petersen writing that the play was not poetry.Meyer (1974, 284‚Äì286). Meyer describes Clemens Petersen as \\"the most influential critic in Scandinavia\\" (1974, 285). He reviewed Peer Gynt in the 30 November 1867 edition of the newspaper Faedrelandet. He wrote that the play \\"is not poetry, because in the transmutation of reality into art it fails to meet the demands of either art or reality.\\" Enraged by Petersen's criticisms in particular, Ibsen defended his work by arguing that it \\"is poetry; and if it isn't, it will become such. The conception of poetry in our country, in Norway, shall shape itself according to this book.\\"Letter to Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson on 9 December 1867; quoted by Meyer (1974, 287). Despite this defense of his poetic achievement in Peer Gynt, the play was his last to employ verse; from The League of Youth (1869) onwards, Ibsen was to write drama only in prose.Watts (1966, 10‚Äì11). Ibsen wrote Peer Gynt in deliberate disregard of the limitations that the conventional stagecraft of the 19th century imposed on drama.Meyer (1974, 288‚Äì289). Its forty scenes move uninhibitedly in time and space and between consciousness and the unconscious, blending folkloric fantasy and unsentimental realism.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 391) and Meyer (1974, 288‚Äì289). Raymond Williams compares Peer Gynt with August Strindberg's early drama Lucky Peter's Journey (1882) and argues that both explore a new kind of dramatic action that was beyond the capacities of the theatre of the day; both created \\"a sequence of images in language and visual composition\\" that \\"became technically possible only in film.\\"Williams (1993, 76). Peer Gynt was first performed in Christiania (now Oslo) on 24 February 1876, with original music composed by Edvard Grieg that includes some of today's most recognized classical pieces, \\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\\" and \\"Morning Mood\\". It was published in German translation in 1881, in English in 1892, and in French in 1896.Farquharson Sharp (1936, 9). The contemporary influence of the play continues into the twenty-first century; it is widely performed internationally both in traditional and in modern experimental productions. Language Peer Gynt was written in Danish, the common written language of Denmark and Norway since the Dano-Norwegian union and throughout Ibsen's lifetime. The language was usually referred to as Danish in Denmark and as Norwegian in Norway, although it was essentially the same written language, and is therefore often called Dano-Norwegian. Due to its basis in Norwegian folktales, the play uses a few Norwegianisms in its vocabulary and idiom, but is otherwise written in a language identical to standard Danish. Peer Gynt was originally published by the Danish publisher Gyldendal in Copenhagen and targeted at both the Danish and the Norwegian market in its original language. Characters Plot =Act I= Peer Gynt is the son of the once highly regarded Jon Gynt. Jon Gynt spent all his money on feasting and living lavishly, and had to leave his farm to become a wandering salesman, leaving his wife and son behind in debt. √Öse, the mother, wished to raise her son to restore the lost fortune of his father, but Peer is soon to be considered useless. He is a poet and a braggart, not unlike the youngest son from Norwegian fairy tales, the \\"Ash Lad\\", with whom he shares some characteristics. As the play opens, Peer gives an account of a reindeer hunt that went awry, a famous theatrical scene generally known as \\"the Buckride\\". His mother scorns him for his vivid imagination, and taunts him because he spoiled his chances with Ingrid, the daughter of the richest farmer. Peer leaves for Ingrid's wedding, scheduled for the following day, because he may still get a chance with the bride. His mother follows quickly to stop him from shaming himself completely. Per Gynt, the hero of the folk-story that Ibsen loosely based Peer Gynt on At the wedding, the other guests taunt and laugh at Peer, especially the local blacksmith, Aslak, who holds a grudge after an earlier brawl. In the same wedding, Peer meets a family of Haugean newcomers from another valley. He instantly notices the elder daughter, Solveig, and asks her to dance. She refuses because her father would disapprove, and because Peer's reputation has preceded him. She leaves, and Peer starts drinking. When he hears the bride has locked herself in, he seizes the opportunity, runs away with her, and spends the night with her in the mountains. =Act II= Peer is banished for kidnapping Ingrid. As he wanders the mountains, his mother and Solveig's father search for him. Peer meets three amorous dairymaids who are waiting to be courted by trolls (a folklore motif from Gudbrandsdalen). He becomes highly intoxicated with them and spends the next day alone suffering from a hangover. He runs head-first into a rock and swoons, and the rest of the second act probably takes place in Peer's dreams. He comes across a woman clad in green, who claims to be the daughter of the troll mountain king. Together they ride into the mountain hall, and the troll king gives Peer the opportunity to become a troll if Peer would marry his daughter. Peer agrees to a number of conditions, but declines in the end. He is then confronted with the fact that the green-clad woman is with child. Peer denies this; he claims not to have touched her, but the wise troll king replies that he begat the child in his head. Crucial for the plot and understanding of the play is the question asked by the troll king: \\"What is the difference between troll and man?\\" The answer given by the Old Man of the Mountain is: \\"Out there, where sky shines, humans say: 'To thyself be true.' In here, trolls say: 'Be true to yourself and to hell with the world.'\\" Egotism is a typical trait of the trolls in this play. From then on, Peer uses this as his motto, always proclaiming that he is himself. He then meets one of the most interesting characters, the B√∏yg ‚Äî a creature who has no real description. Asked the question \\"Who are you?\\" The B√∏yg answers, \\"Myself\\". In time, Peer also takes the B√∏yg's important saying as a motto: \\"Go around\\". The rest of his life, he \\"beats around the bush\\" instead of facing himself or the truth. Upon awaking, Peer is confronted by Helga, Solveig's sister, who gives him food and regards from her sister. Peer gives the girl a silver button for Solveig to keep and asks that she not forget him. =Act III= As an outlaw, Peer struggles to build his own cottage in the hills. Solveig turns up and insists on living with him. She has made her choice, she says, and there will be no return for her. Peer is delighted and welcomes her, but as she enters the cabin, an elderly-appearing woman in green garments appears with a limping boy at her side. This is the green-clad woman from the mountain hall, and her half-human brat is the child begotten by Peer from his mind during his stay there. She has cursed Peer by forcing him to remember her and all his previous sins, when facing Solveig. Peer hears a ghostly voice saying \\"Go roundabout, Peer\\", and decides to leave. He tells Solveig he has something heavy to fetch. He returns in time for his mother's death, and then sets off overseas. =Act IV= Sphinx Peer is away for many years, taking part in various occupations and playing various roles including that of a businessman engaged in enterprises on the coast of Morocco. Here, he explains his view of life, and we learn that he is a businessman taking part in unethical transactions, including sending heathen images to China and trading slaves. In his defense, he points out that he has also sent missionaries to China, and he treated his slaves well. His companions rob him, after he decides to support the Turks in suppressing a Greek revolt, and leave him alone on the shore. He then finds some stolen Bedouin gear, and, in these clothes, he is hailed as a prophet by a local tribe. He tries to seduce Anitra, the chieftain's daughter, but she steals his money and rings, gets away, and leaves him. Then he decides to become a historian and travels to Egypt. He wanders through the desert, passing the Colossi of Memnon and the Sphinx. As he addresses the Sphinx, believing it to be the B√∏yg, he encounters the keeper of the local madhouse, himself insane, who regards Peer as the bringer of supreme wisdom. Peer comes to the madhouse and understands that all of the patients live in their own worlds, being themselves to such a degree that no one cares for anyone else. In his youth, Peer had dreamt of becoming an emperor. In this place, he is finally hailed as one‚Äîthe emperor of the \\"self\\". Peer despairs and calls for the \\"Keeper of all fools\\", i.e., God. =Act V= Finally, on his way home as an old man, he is shipwrecked. Among those on board, he meets the Strange Passenger, who wants to make use of Peer's corpse to find out where dreams have their origin. This passenger scares Peer out of his wits. Peer lands on shore bereft of all of his possessions, a pitiful and grumpy old man. Back home in Norway, Peer Gynt attends a peasant funeral and an auction, where he offers for sale everything from his earlier life. The auction takes place at the very farm where the wedding once was held. Peer stumbles along and is confronted with all that he did not do, his unsung songs, his unmade works, his unwept tears, and his questions that were never asked. His mother comes back and claims that her deathbed went awry; he did not lead her to heaven with his ramblings. Peer escapes and is confronted with the Button-molder, who maintains that Peer's soul must be melted down with other faulty goods unless he can explain when and where in life he has been \\"himself\\". Peer protests. He has been only that, and nothing else. Then he meets the troll king, who states that Peer has been a troll, not a man, most of his life. The Button-molder comes along and says that he has to come up with something if he is not to be melted down. Peer looks for a priest to whom to confess his sins, and a character named \\"The Lean One\\" (who is the Devil) turns up. The Lean One believes Peer cannot be counted a real sinner who can be sent to Hell; he has committed no grave sin. Peer despairs in the end, understanding that his life is forfeit; he is nothing. But at the same moment, Solveig starts to sing‚Äîthe cabin Peer built is close at hand, but he dares not enter. The B√∏yg in Peer tells him \\"go around\\". The Button-molder shows up and demands a list of sins, but Peer has none to give, unless Solveig can vouch for him. Then Peer breaks through to Solveig, asking her to forgive his sins. But she answers: \\"You have not sinned at all, my dearest boy.\\" Peer does not understand‚Äîhe believes himself lost. Then he asks her: \\"Where has Peer Gynt been since we last met? Where was I as the one I should have been, whole and true, with the mark of God on my brow?\\" She answers: \\"In my faith, in my hope, in my love.\\" Peer screams, calls his mother, and hides himself in her lap. Solveig sings her lullaby for him, and we might presume he dies in this last scene of the play, although there are neither stage directions nor dialogue to indicate that he actually does. Behind the corner, the Button-molder, who is sent by God, still waits, with the words: \\"Peer, we shall meet at the last crossroads, and then we shall see if... I'll say no more.\\" Analysis Klaus van den Berg argues that Peer Gynt > ... is a stylistic minefield: Its origins are romantic, but the play also > anticipates the fragmentations of emerging Modernism.

But in the Yahwistic, biblical sense, > Peer the scamp bears the blessing: More life. Writing process On 5 January 1867 Ibsen wrote to Frederik Hegel, his publisher, with his plan for the play: it would be \\"a long dramatic poem, having as its principal a part-legendary, part-fictional character from Norwegian folklore during recent times. It will bear no resemblance to Brand, and will contain no direct polemics or anything of that kind.\\"Quoted by Meyer (1974, 276). He began to write Peer Gynt on 14 January, employing a far greater variety of metres in its rhymed verse than he had used in his previous verse plays Brand (written 1865) or Love's Comedy (written 1862).Peer Gynt employs octosyllabics and decasyllabics, iambic, trochaic, dactylic, anapaestic, as well as amphibrachs. See Meyer (1974, 277). The first two acts were completed in Rome and the third in Casamicciola on the north of the island of Ischia.Meyer (1974, 277‚Äì279). During this time, Ibsen told Vilhelm Bergs√∏e that \\"I don't think the play's for acting\\" when they discussed the possibility of staging the play's image of a casting-ladle \\"big enough to re- cast human beings in.\\"Quoted by Meyer (1974, 279). Ibsen sent the three acts to his publisher on 8 August, with a letter that explains that \\"Peer Gynt was a real person who lived in Gudbrandsdal, probably around the end of the last century or the beginning of this. His name is still famous among the people up there, but not much more is known about his life than what is to be found in Asbj√∏rnsen's Norwegian Folktales (in the section entitled 'Stories from the Mountain').\\"See Meyer (1974, 282). In those stories, Peer Gynt rescues the three dairy-maids from the trolls and shoots the B√∏yg, who was originally a gigantic worm-shaped troll-being. Peer was known to tell tall tales of his own achievements, a trait Peer in the play inherited. The \\"buck-ride\\" story, which Peer tells his mother in the play's first scene, is also from this source, but, as √Öse points out, it was originally Gudbrand Glesne from V√•g√• who did the tour with the reindeer stag and finally shot it. Following an earthquake on Ischia on 14 August, Ibsen left for Sorrento, where he completed the final two acts; he finished the play on 14 October.Meyer (1974, 282). Meyer points out that Ibsen's fear of subsequent earthquakes in the town, which motivated his swift departure from the island, were not groundless, since it was destroyed by one 16 years later. It was published in a first edition of 1,250 copies a month later in Copenhagen. Background Ibsen's previous play, Brand, preached the philosophy of ‚ÄúAll or nothing.‚Äù Relentless, cruel, resolute, overriding in will, Brand went through everything that stood in his way toward gaining an ideal. Peer Gynt is a compensating balance, a complementary color to Brand. In contrast to Brand, with his iron will, Peer is will-less, insufficient, and irresolute. Peer \\"goes around\\" all issues facing him. Brand had a phenomenal literary success, and people became curious to know what Ibsen's next play would be. The dramatist, about this time, was relieved of financial worry by two money grants, one from the Norwegian government and the other from the Scientific Society of Trondhjem. This enabled him to give to his work an unfettered mind. He went with his family to Frascati, where, in the Palazzo rooms, he looked many feet down upon the Mediterranean, and pondered his new drama. He preserved a profound silence about the content of the play, and begged his publisher, Hegel, to create as much mystery about it as possible. Ibsen's mother, Marichen Altenburg, was the model for Peer Gynt's mother, √Öse The portrayal of the Gynt family is known to be based on Henrik Ibsen's own family and childhood memories; in a letter to Georg Brandes, Ibsen wrote that his own family and childhood had served \\"as some kind of model\\" for the Gynt family. In a letter to Peter Hansen, Ibsen confirmed that the character √Öse, Peer Gynt's mother, was based on his own mother, Marichen Altenburg.Robert Ferguson, Henrik Ibsen. A New Biography, Richard Cohen Books, London 1996 The character Jon Gynt is considered to be based on Ibsen's father Knud Ibsen, who was a rich merchant before he went bankrupt. Even the name of the Gynt family's ancestor, the prosperous Rasmus Gynt, is borrowed from the Ibsen's family's earliest known ancestor. Thus, the character Peer Gynt could be interpreted as being an ironic representation of Henrik Ibsen himself. There are striking similarities to Ibsen's own life; Ibsen himself spent 27 years living abroad and was never able to face his hometown again. Grieg's music Ibsen asked Edvard Grieg to compose incidental music for the play. Grieg composed a score that plays approximately ninety minutes. Grieg extracted two suites of four pieces each from the incidental music (Opus 46 and Opus 55), which became very popular as concert music. One of the sung parts of the incidental music, \\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\\", was included in the first suite with the vocal parts omitted. Originally, the second suite had a fifth number, \\"The Dance of the Mountain King's Daughter\\", but Grieg withdrew it. Grieg himself declared that it was easier to make music \\"out of his own head\\" than strictly following suggestions made by Ibsen. For instance, Ibsen wanted music that would characterize the \\"international\\" friends in the fourth act, by melding the said national anthems (Norwegian, Swedish, German, French and English). Reportedly, Grieg was not in the right mood for this task. The music of these suites, especially \\"Morning Mood\\" starting the first suite, \\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\\", and the string lament \\"√Öse's Death\\" later reappeared in numerous arrangements, soundtracks, etc. Other Norwegian composers who have written theatrical music for Peer Gynt include Harald S√¶verud (1947), Arne Nordheim (1969), Ketil Hvoslef (1993) and Jon Mostad (1993‚Äì4). Gunnar S√∏nstevold (1966) wrote music for a ballet version of Peer Gynt. Notable productions In 1906 scenes from the play were given by the Progressive Stage Society of New York. The first US production of Peer Gynt opened at the Chicago Grand Opera House on October 24, 1906, and starred the noted actor Richard Mansfield, in one of his very last roles before his untimely death. In 1923, Joseph Schildkraut played the role on Broadway, in a Theatre Guild production, featuring Selena Royle, Helen Westley, Dudley Digges, and, before he entered films, Edward G. Robinson. In 1944, at the Old Vic, Ralph Richardson played the role, surrounded by some of the greatest British actors of the time in supporting or bit roles, among them Sybil Thorndike as √Öse, and Laurence Olivier as the Button Molder. In 1951, John Garfield fulfilled his wish to star in a Broadway production, featuring Mildred Dunnock as √Öse. This production was not a success, and is said by some to have contributed to Garfield's death at age 39. On film, years before he became a superstar, the seventeen-year-old Charlton Heston starred as Peer in a silent, student-made, low-budget film version of the play produced in 1941. Peer Gynt, however, has never been given a full-blown treatment as a sound film in English on the motion picture screen, although there have been several television productions, and a sound film was produced in German in 1934. In 1957, Ingmar Bergman produced a five-hour stage version of Peer Gynt, at Sweden's Malm√∂ City Theatre, with Max von Sydow as Peer Gynt. Bergman produced the play again, 34 years later, in 1991, at Sweden's Royal Dramatic Theatre, this time with B√∂rje Ahlstedt in the title role. Bergman chose not to use Grieg's music, nor the more modern Harald S√¶verud composition, but rather traditional Norwegian folk music, and little of that either. In 1993, Christopher Plummer starred in his own concert version of the play, with the Hartford Symphony Orchestra in Hartford, Connecticut. This was a new performing version and a collaboration of Plummer and Hartford Symphony Orchestra Music Director Michael Lankester. Plummer had long dreamed of starring in a fully staged production of the play, but had been unable to. The 1993 production was not a fully staged version, but rather a drastically condensed concert version, narrated by Plummer, who also played the title role, and accompanied by Edvard Grieg's complete incidental music for the play. This version included a choir and vocal parts for soprano and mezzo- soprano. Plummer performed the concert version again in 1995 with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra with Lankester conducting. The 1995 production was broadcast on Canadian radio. It has never been presented on television. It has also never been released on compact disc. In the 1990s Plummer and Lankester also collaborated on and performed similarly staged concert versions of A Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare (with music by Mendelssohn) and Ivan the Terrible (an arrangement of a Prokofiev film score with script for narrator). Among the three aforementioned Plummer/Lankester collaborations, all received live concert presentations and live radio broadcasts, but only Ivan the Terrible was released on CD. Alex Jennings won the Olivier Award for Best Actor 1995/1996 for his performance in the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of Peer Gynt. In 1999 Braham Murray directed a production at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester with David Threlfall as Peer Gynt, Josette Bushell-Mingo as Solveig and Espen Skjonberg as Button Moulder. In 2000, the Royal National Theatre staged a version based on the 1990 translation of the play by Frank McGuinness. The production featured three actors playing Peer, including Chiwetel Ejiofor as the young Peer, Patrick O'Kane as Peer in his adventures in Africa, and Joseph Marcell as the old Peer. Not only was the use of three actors playing one character unusual in itself, but the actors were part of a \\"color-blind\\" cast: Ejiofor and Marcell are Black, and O'Kane is White. In 2001 at the BBC Proms, the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra and BBC Singers, conducted by Manfred Honeck, performed the complete incidental music in Norwegian with an English narration read by Simon Callow. In 2005 Chicago's storefront theater The Artistic Home mounted an acclaimed production (directed by Kathy Scambiatterra and written by Norman Ginsbury) that received two Jeff Nominations for its dynamic staging in a 28-seat house. The role of Peer was played by a single actor, John Mossman. In 2006, Robert Wilson staged a co-production revival with both the National Theater of Bergen and the Norwegian Theatre of Oslo, Norway. Ann-Christin Rommen directed the actors in Norwegian (with English subtitles). This production mixed both Wilson's minimalist (yet constantly moving) stage designs with technological effects to bring out the play's expansive potential. Furthermore, they utilized state-of-the-art microphones, sound systems, and recorded acoustic and electronic music to bring clarity to the complex and shifting action and dialogue. From April 11 through the 16th, they performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Howard Gilman Opera House. In 2006, as part of the Norwegian Ibsen anniversary festival, Peer Gynt was set at the foot of the Great Sphinx of Giza near Cairo, Egypt (an important location in the original play). The director was Bentein Baardson. The performance was the centre of some controversy, with some critics seeing it as a display of colonialist attitudes. In January 2008 the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis debuted a new translation of Peer Gynt by the poet Robert Bly. Bly learned Norwegian from his grandparents while growing up in rural Minnesota, and later during several years of travel in Norway. This production stages Ibsen's text rather abstractly, tying it loosely into a modern birthday party for a 50-year-old man. It also significantly cuts the length of the play. (An earlier production of the full-length play at the Guthrie required the audience to return a second night to see the second half of the play.) In 2009, Dundee Rep with the National Theatre of Scotland toured a production. This interpretation, with much of the dialogue in modern Scots, received mixed reviews. The cast included Gerry Mulgrew as the older Peer. Directed by Dominic Hill. In November 2010 Southampton Philharmonic Choir and the New London Sinfonia performed the complete incidental music using a new English translation commissioned from Beryl Foster. In the performance, the musical elements were linked by an English narrative read by actor Samuel West. From June 28 through July 24, 2011, La Jolla Playhouse ran a production of Peer Gynt as a co-production with the Kansas City Repertory Theatre, adapted and directed by David Schweizer. The 2011 Dublin Theatre Festival presented a new version of Peer Gynt by Arthur Riordan, directed by Lynne Parker with music by Tarab. In November 2013, Basingstoke Choral Society (directed by David Gibson, who also directs Southampton Philharmonic Choir) reprised the earlier performance by their colleagues in Southampton. In June 2019, Toneelgroep Twister in Nijmegen, The Netherlands The Peer Gynt Festival At Vinstra in the Gudbrandsdalen valley, Henrik Ibsen and Peer Gynt have been celebrated with an annual festival since 1967. The festival is one of Norway's largest cultural festivals, and is recognized by the Norwegian Government as a leading institution of presenting culture in nature. The festival has a broad festival program with theatre, concerts, an art exhibition and several debates and literature seminars. The main event in the festival is the outdoor theatre production of Peer Gynt at G√•l√•. The play is staged in Peer Gynts birthplace, where Ibsen claims he found inspiration for the character Peer Gynt, and is regarded by many as the most authentic version. The play is performed by professional actors from the national theater institutions, and nearly 80 local amateur actors. The music to the play is inspired by the original theatre music by Edvard Grieg ‚Äì the \\"Peer Gynt suite\\". The play is one of the most popular theater productions in Norway, attracting more than 12,000 people every summer. The festival also holds the Peer Gynt Prize, which is a national Norwegian honor prize given to a person or institution that has achieved distinction in society and contributed to improving Norway's international reputation. Peer Gynt Sculpture Park Peer Gynt Sculpture Park (Peer Gynt- parken) is a sculpture park located in Oslo, Norway. Created in honour of Henrik Ibsen, it is a monumental presentation of Peer Gynt, scene by scene. It was established in 2006 by Selvaag, the company behind the housing development in the area. Most of the sculptures in this park are the result of an international sculpture competition. Adaptations Theatre posters for Peer Gynt and an adaptation entitled Peer Gynt-innen? in Ibsen Museum, Oslo In 1912 German writer Dietrich Eckart adapted the play. In Eckart's version, the play became \\"a powerful dramatisation of nationalist and anti-semitic ideas\\", in which Gynt represents the superior Germanic hero, struggling against implicitly Jewish \\"trolls\\".Brown, Kristi (2006) \\"The Troll Among Us\\", in Powrie, Phil et al. (ed), Changing Tunes: The Use of Pre-existing Music in Film, Ashgate. pp.74‚Äì91 In this racial allegory the trolls and Great B√∏yg represented what philosopher Otto Weininger - Eckart's hero - conceived as the Jewish spirit. Eckart's version was one of the best attended productions of the age with more than 600 performances in Berlin alone. Eckart later helped to found the Nazi Party and served as a mentor to Adolf Hitler; he was also the first editor of the party's newspaper, the V√∂lkische Beobachter. He never had another theatrical success after Peer Gynt. In 1938 German composer Werner Egk finished an opera based on the story. In 1948, the composer Harald S√¶verud made a new score for the nynorsk-production at \\"the Norwegian Theatre\\" (Det Norske Teatret) in Oslo. S√¶verud incorporated the national music of each of the friends in the fourth act, as per Ibsen's request, who died in 1906. In 1951, North Carolinian playwright Paul Green published an American version of the Norwegian play. This is the version in which actor John Garfield starred on Broadway. This version is also the American Version, and features subtle plot differences from Ibsen's original work, including the omittance of the shipwreck scene near the end, and the Buttonmolder character playing a moderately larger role. In 1961, Hugh Leonard's version, The Passion of Peter Ginty, transferred the play to an Irish Civil War setting. It was staged at Dublin's Gate Theatre. In 1969, Broadway impresario Jacques Levy (who had previously directed the first version of Oh! Calcutta!) commissioned The Byrds' Roger McGuinn to write the music for a pop (or country-rock) version of Peer Gynt, to be titled Gene Tryp. The play was apparently never completed, although, as of 2006, McGuinn was preparing a version for release. Several songs from the abortive show appeared on the Byrds' albums of 1970 and 1971. In March 1972 Jerry Heymann's adaptation,http://www.newlighttheaterproject.com/jerry-heymann called Mr. Gynt, Inc., was performed at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club.La MaMa Archives Digital Collections, \\"Production: Mr. Gynt, Inc.\\". Retrieved March 7, 2018. In 1981, Houston Ballet presented Peer Gynt as adapted by Artistic Director Ben Stevenson, OBE. In 1989, John Neumeier created a ballet \\"freely based on Ibsen's play\\", for which Alfred Schnittke composed the score. In 1998, the Trinity Repertory Company of Providence, Rhode Island commissioned David Henry Hwang and Swiss director Stephan Muller to do an adaptation of Peer Gynt. In 1998, playwright Romulus Linney directed his adaptation of the play, entitled Gint, at the Theatre for the New City in New York. This adaptation moved the play's action to 20th-century Appalachia and California. In 2001, Rogaland Theatre produced an adaptation entitled Peer Gynt-innen?, loosely translated as Peer the Gyntess? This was a one-act monologue performed by Marika Enstad. In 2007, St. John's Prep of Danvers, Massachusetts won the MHSDG Festival with their production starring Bo Burnham. In 2008, Theater in the Open in Newburyport, Massachusetts, produced a production of Peer Gynt adapted and directed by Paul Wann and the company. Scott Smith, whose great, great grandfather (Ole Bull) was one of the inspirations for the character, was cast as Gynt. In 2009, a DVD was released of Heinz Spoerli's ballet, which he had created in 2007. This ballet uses mostly the Grieg music, but adds selections by other composers. Spoken excerpts from the play, in Norwegian, are also included. In Israel, poet Dafna Eilat (:he:◊ì◊§◊†◊î ◊ê◊ô◊ú◊™) composed a poem in Hebrew called \\"Solveig\\", which she also set to music, its theme derived from the play and emphasizing the named character's boundless faithful love. It was performed by Hava Alberstein (see ). In 2011, Polarity Ensemble Theatre in Chicago presented another version of Robert Bly's translation of the play, in which Peer's mythic journey was envisioned as that of America itself, \\"a 150-year whirlwind tour of the American psyche.\\" On an episode of \\"Inside the Actor's Studio\\", Elton John spontaneously composed a song based on a passage from Peer Gynt. The German a cappella metal band Van Canto also made a theatrical a cappella metal adaption of the story, naming it \\"Peer Returns\\". The first episode that has been released up until now, called \\"A Storm to Come\\", appears on the band's album Break the Silence. Will Eno's adaptation of Ibsen's Peer Gynt titled Gnit had its world premiere at the 37th Humana Festival of New American Plays in March 2013. In 2020, a new audio drama adaptation of Peer Gynt by Colin Macnee, written in verse form with original music, was released in podcast form. =Films= There have been a number of film adaptations including: * Peer Gynt (1915 film), an American film directed by Oscar Apfel and Raoul Walsh * Peer Gynt (1918 film), a German film directed by Richard Oswald * Peer Gynt (1934 film), a German film directed by Fritz Wendhausen * Peer Gynt (1941 film), notable for being the film debut of Charlton Heston * Peer Gynt (1981 film), a French TV film directed by Bernard Sobel * Peer Gynt (1971 film), a German language TV film starring Edith Clever * Peer Gynt (1979 animated film), Russian animation studio Soyuzmultfilm animated film \\"–ü–µ—Ä –ì—é–Ω—Ç\\". * Peer Gynt (2006 film), a German TV film directed by Uwe Janson * Peer Gynt (2017 film), a Belgian short film directed by Michiel Robberecht Notes Sources * Banham, Martin, ed. 1998.

He is currently a co-presenter of the ITV Breakfast programme Good Morning Britain from Monday to Wednesday each week. Morgan began his career in Fleet Street as a writer and editor for several tabloid papers, including The Sun, News of the World, and the Daily Mirror. In 1994, aged 29, he was appointed editor of the News of the World by Rupert Murdoch, which made him the youngest editor of a British national newspaper in more than half a century. On television, he hosted Piers Morgan Live on CNN from 2011 to 2014, replacing Larry King Live in the timeslot following King's retirement.\\"Piers Morgan is Larry King's CNN replacement\\", MSNBC, 8 September 2010. Retrieved 7 February 2014. He was a judge on America's Got Talent and Britain's Got Talent. In 2008, Morgan won the seventh season of the US Celebrity Apprentice. In the UK, he has presented Piers Morgan's Life Stories since 2009, and Good Morning Britain since 2015. Morgan has written eight books, including four volumes of memoirs. While working at Daily Mirror, he was in charge during the period that the paper was implicated in the phone hacking scandal. In 2011, Morgan denied having ever hacked a phone or \\"to my knowledge published any story obtained from the hacking of a phone\\". In 2012, he was criticised in the findings of the Leveson Inquiry by chair Brian Leveson who stated that comments made in Morgan's testimony about phone hacking were \\"utterly unpersuasive\\" and \\"that he was aware that it was taking place in the press as a whole and that he was sufficiently unembarrassed by what was criminal behaviour that he was prepared to joke about it\\". Early life Morgan was born Piers Stefan O'Meara on 30 March 1965 in Surrey, the son of Vincent Eamonn O'Meara, an Irish dentist from County Offaly,Piers Morgan reference to his father's background, Offalyindependent.ie (cached), 21 January 2011. Retrieved 7 February 2014. and Gabrielle Georgina Sybille (n√©e Oliver), an English woman who raised Morgan Catholic. With regard to his religious views, Morgan still identifies as a Catholic due to his mother's influence, and believes in an afterlife, but does not \\"go to Confession, probably because it would take [him] too long\\". He has a brother, Jeremy, who is older than him by two years. A few months after his birth, the family moved to Newick, East Sussex. His father died when Morgan was 11 months old; his mother later married Glynne Pughe-Morgan,Piers Morgan, The Hot Seat: Love, War, and Cable News (2014), p. 5Roy Greenslade, Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits from Propaganda (2004), p. 602 a Welsh pub landlord who later worked in the meat distribution business, and he took his stepfather's surname. He was educated at the independent Cumnor House prep school between the ages of seven and 13, then Chailey School, a comprehensive secondary school in Chailey. After nine months at Lloyd's of London, Morgan studied journalism at Harlow College. Morgan joined the Surrey and South London Newspaper Group in 1985. Press career =At the Murdoch titles= Morgan began to work as a freelance at The Sun in 1988, at this point dropping his double-barrelled name. He told Hunter Davies in December 1994 that he was personally recruited by Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie to work on the newspaper's show business column \\"Bizarre\\", his first high-profile post. Although he was not a fan of pop music, he was considered skilled at self-publicity and became the column's main writer. \\"I became the Friend of the Stars, a rampant egomaniac, pictured all the time with famous people ‚Äì Madonna, Stallone, Bowie, Paul McCartney, hundreds of them. It was shameless, as they didn't know me from Adam\\", he told Davies. In January 1994, he became editor of the News of the World after being appointed to the job by Rupert Murdoch. Initially an acting editor, he was confirmed in the summer, becoming at 29 the youngest national newspaper editor in more than half a century. Morgan left this post in 1995 shortly after publishing photographs of Catherine Victoria Lockwood, then wife of Charles, Earl Spencer, leaving an addictive disorders clinic in Surrey. This action ran against the editors' code of conduct,\\"Profile: Piers Morgan\\", BBC News, 14 May 2004 a misdemeanour for which the Press Complaints Commission upheld a complaint against Morgan. Murdoch was reported as having said that \\"the boy went too far\\"Ginny Dougary \\"Educating Piers\\", The Times Magazine, 7 April 2007. and publicly distanced himself from the story.\\"Earl Spencer loses privacy battle to Europe\\", BBC News, 16 January 1998 Fearful of a privacy law action if he had not criticised one of his employees, Murdoch is said to have apologised to Morgan in private.Tom Watson and Martin Hickman Dial M for Murdoch: News Corporation and the Corruption of Britain, London: Penguin, 2012, p. 30Benjamin Wallace \\"Piers Morgan Isn‚Äôt Sleeping Well\\", New York (magazine), 9 October 2011 The incident was reported to have contributed to Morgan's decision to leave for the Daily Mirror editorship. Morgan's autobiography The Insider states that he left the News of the World for the Mirror of his own choice. It asserts he was an admirer of former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for most of her period of office, making the appointment surprising as the Mirror is a Labour-supporting title. =Daily Mirror editor= As editor of the Daily Mirror, Morgan was forced to apologise on television for the headline (rendered in upper case) \\"Achtung Surrender! For You Fritz Ze Euro Championship Is Over\\" on 25 June 1996, a day before England met Germany in a semi-final of the Euro '96 football championships.George Wilkes and Dominic Wing \\"The British Press and European Integration: 1948 to 1996\\", in David Baker, David Seawright (eds.) Britain for and Against Europe: British Politics and the Question of European Integration, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 202 A ¬£16 million package of investment in the title was rolled out from January, including the dropping of \\"Daily\\" from the masthead in February,Roy Greenslade Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits From Propaganda, London: Pan, 2004 [2003], p. 657 which was later reversed. Roy Greenslade wrote in August 1999 that Morgan's editorship \\"has made a huge difference: his enormous enthusiasm, determination and focus is a major plus\\".Roy Greenslade \\"Chasing the Sun's tail\\", The Guardian, 16 August 1999 Morgan was the subject of an investigation in 2000 after Suzy Jagger wrote an article for The Daily Telegraph revealing that he had bought ¬£20,000 worth of shares in the computer company Viglen soon before the Mirror 's \\"City Slickers\\" column tipped Viglen as a good buy. Morgan was found by the Press Complaints Commission to have breached the Code of Conduct on financial journalism, but kept his job. The \\"City Slickers\\" columnists, Anil Bhoyrul and James Hipwell, were both found to have committed further breaches of the Code and were sacked before the inquiry concluded. Further enquiry by the Department of Trade and Industry in 2004 cleared Morgan of any charges. On 7 December 2005, Bhoyrul and Hipwell were convicted of conspiracy to breach the Financial Services Act. During the trial it emerged that Morgan had bought ¬£67,000 worth of Viglen shares, emptying his bank account and investing under his (first) wife's name, too. The Mirror attempted to move mid-market in 2002, eschewing the more trivial stories of show-business and gossip, and appointed Christopher Hitchens as a columnist, but sales declined. In the wake of the Abu Ghraib torture scandal, Morgan was sacked as editor of the Daily Mirror \\"with immediate effect\\" on 14 May 2004, after refusing to apologise to Sly Bailey, then head of Trinity Mirror, for authorising the newspaper's publication of photographs which had been shown to be false.Chris Tryhorn and Lisa O'Carroll \\"Morgan sacked from Daily Mirror\\", Media Guardian, 14 May 2004 These were alleged to show Iraqi prisoners being abused by British Army soldiers from the Queen's Lancashire Regiment. When, within days the photographs were shown to be crude fakes, under the headline \\"SORRY..WE WERE HOAXED\\", the Mirror responded that it had fallen victim to a \\"calculated and malicious hoax\\" and apologised for the publication of the photographs. However, Morgan has refused to admit that the photographs were faked, and has stated that the abuse shown in the photographs is similar to the sort of abuse which was happening in the British Army in Iraq at the time. =Post-Mirror press career= In partnership with Matthew Freud, he gained ownership in May 2005 of Press Gazette, a media trade publication together with its \\"cash cow\\", the British Press Awards, in a deal worth ¬£1 million. This ownership was cited as one of the reasons many major newspapers boycotted the 2006 awards. Press Gazette entered administrative receivership toward the end of 2006, before being sold to a trade buyer. First News was launched by Morgan on 4 May 2006. A weekly paper aimed at seven to 14-year-olds, he said at its launch that the paper was to be \\"Britain's first national newspaper for children\\".\\"Britain's first national newspaper for children to launch Friday\\", Associated Press, 4 May 2006Other newspapers aimed at young audiences have included The Boy's Newspaper (1880‚Äì1882), The Children's Newspaper (1919‚Äì1965), and Early Times (launched in the late 1980s) Morgan was editorial director at First News, responsible for bringing in celebrity involvement. He referred to the role as \\"editorial overlord and frontman\\". Morgan was filmed falling off a Segway, breaking three ribs, in 2007. Simon Cowell outspokenly mocked Morgan's previous comment in 2003, in a Mirror headline after former U.S. President George W. Bush fell off a Segway: \\"You'd have to be an idiot to fall off wouldn't you, Mr President\\". In 2012, following the revelation of Jimmy Savile's sexual abuse against children, Morgan said to have \\"never met\\" Savile in his lifetime; however, it was pointed out that in a 2009 piece by Morgan in The Mail on Sunday Night & Day magazine he wrote that \\"As I left, Jimmy Savile came up to me. 'Your TV shows are BRILLIANT!, he exclaimed. ... I've always loved Jimmy Savile.\\" He became the editor-at-large of the MailOnline website's US operation in September 2014 and wrote several columns a week. Television career Morgan's career expanded into television presenting before he left the Daily Mirror. He presented a three-part television documentary series for the BBC titled The Importance of Being Famous (2003), about fame and the manner in which celebrities are covered by modern media. At the annual Pride of Britain Awards broadcast on ITV, Morgan chaired a panel of prominent people who had chosen the recipients of the awards from 1999 to 2006. He co-hosted a current affairs interview show on Channel 4 with Amanda Platell, Morgan and Platell. Morgan and Platell were put together because of their opposing political viewpoints; Platell interrogated guests from the right wing, Morgan from the left wing. The show was dropped after three series reputedly because of poor viewing figures, although the chairman of Channel 4 Luke Johnson was reported not to like the programme.\\"Morgan and Platell to return on Channel 4\\", The Guardian, 12 May 2005 Throughout 2006, Morgan appeared as a judge on the television show America's Got Talent alongside Brandy Norwood and David Hasselhoff on NBC. Morgan was chosen by Simon Cowell as a replacement for himself because of the conditions of his American Idol contract. Morgan appeared as a celebrity contestant on Comic Relief Does The Apprentice in 2007, to raise money for the BBC charity telethon Comic Relief. After his team lost, Morgan was selected by Sir Alan Sugar as the contestant to be fired. Also in 2007, Morgan appeared as a judge for the second season of America's Got Talent and also appeared as a judge on Britain's Got Talent on ITV, alongside Amanda Holden and Simon Cowell. He also presented You Can't Fire Me, I'm Famous on BBC One. He fronted a three-part documentary about Sandbanks for ITV entitled Piers Morgan on Sandbanks in January 2008. In 2008, Morgan signed a two-year \\"golden handcuffs\\" deal with ITV in May, reportedly worth ¬£2 million per year. As part of the deal, he would continue as a judge on Britain's Got Talent for at least two more series and front a new chat show. He also made some interview specials, plus three more documentaries from various countries. Morgan's golden handcuffs deal was the first signing by ITV's new director of television, Peter Fincham. In February 2009, he began a three-part series, Piers Morgan On..., which saw him visit Dubai, Monte Carlo and Hollywood. The programme returned for a second series in 2010 when Morgan visited Las Vegas in one episode. Also in 2009, his began hosting Piers Morgan's Life Stories on ITV, with Sharon Osbourne as the subject of the first episode. Other guests on the programme included Cheryl and the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. On 8 September 2010, CNN announced that Morgan would replace Larry King in the network's evening line-up with his show, Piers Morgan Live, beginning on 17 January 2011. After poor ratings, CNN announced that the show was to be axed.Charles Riley \\"CNN to end 'Piers Morgan Live'\\", CNN, 24 February 2014 It was cancelled in February 2014 and ended its run in March 2014. Commenting on the viewing figures, Morgan said that he was \\"a British guy debating American cultural issues, including guns, which has been very polarizing, and there is no doubt that there are many in the audience who are tired of me banging on about it.\\" From 13 to 17 April 2015, Morgan guest- hosted five episodes of Good Morning Britain on ITV and became a permanent co- host in November 2015, appearing alongside Susanna Reid and Charlotte Hawkins. \\"You can't help but go into battle with him every morning\\", Reid has said of her colleague with whom she has clashed. From 2016 to 2017, Morgan interviewed female murderers on the TV series Killer Women with Piers Morgan. He also presented Serial Killer with Piers Morgan, as part of the 2017 Crime & Punishment season on ITV. In October 2018, Morgan appeared as a cameo on Hollyoaks. In April 2020, Morgan announced he would be taking a break from his television roles as he awaited a COVID-19 diagnosis. He tested negative for the disease, before returning to his presenting duties. =Donald Trump= Morgan was the winner of the U.S. celebrity version of The Apprentice, in 2008. He was eventually the overall winner, being named Celebrity Apprentice by host Donald Trump on 27 March, ahead of fellow finalist, American country music star Trace Adkins,Johnson, Caitlin (28 March 2008). \\"Relative unknown wins ‚ÄòCelebrity Apprentice‚Äô\\".

Reality TV World. Morgan was called \\"ruthless, arrogant, evil and obnoxious\\" by Trump in the final. Morgan stated he personally would not vote for Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election (though as a permanent resident of the United States, not a citizen, he is not qualified to vote). He predicted Trump's election as President of the United States and has described himself as a close friend. Morgan interviewed Trump on Good Morning Britain in March 2016. Morgan appeared on ITV's Loose Women panel show in late January 2017, and was challenged to repudiate Trump. He refused to do so, despite stating that he disagreed with him on many issues relating to gun control, climate change, abortion, and the \\"Muslim travel ban\\", saying that he found the principle of the ban understandable, but disagreed with \\"the way [Trump] has gone about it\\". Nearly a fortnight later, on the American talk show Real Time with Bill Maher, Morgan said \\"There is no Muslim ban\\", as \\"85% of the world's Muslims are allowed in the country\\". Another participant in the discussion, Australian comedian Jim Jefferies, immediately swore at Morgan and criticised his defence of Trump. After the novelist J. K. Rowling tweeted \\"Yes, watching Piers Morgan being told to fuck off on live TV is *exactly* as satisfying as I'd always imagined\\", the two began an exchange of words on the social media site. Morgan criticised Trump after he retweeted Jayda Fransen, deputy leader of the small right-wing party Britain First in late November 2017. He tweeted to Trump: \\"What the hell are you doing retweeting a bunch of unverified videos by Britain First, a bunch of disgustingly racist far-right extremists? Please STOP this madness & undo your retweets\\". In January 2018, Morgan presented President Trump ‚Äì The Piers Morgan Interview for ITV, which many thought of as \\"sycophantic\\" and a \\"love-in\\" for Trump. Of respondents to a Radio Times Twitter poll, 88% viewed Morgan as being not \\"tough enough\\" on Trump. Morgan interviewed Trump again in July 2018 during his official visit to the UK, this time on Air Force One during an internal flight, in a TV special entitled Piers, The President and Air Force One. In December 2018, Morgan wrote a letter to Trump formally applying to become White House Chief of Staff. During Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom in June 2019, Morgan once again interviewed Trump, this time at the Churchill War Rooms. In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Morgan wrote a highly critical article of Trump's handling of the crisis in his column for MailOnline. Morgan particularly took issue with Trump's suggestion of looking into \\"ingesting\\" disinfectant as a possible solution, describing it as \\"batshit crazy\\". In response to the criticism, Morgan announced Trump had unfollowed him from Twitter.  Controversies  =Ian Hislop feud= Morgan appeared as a guest on the BBC satirical news quiz Have I Got News for You in an episode transmitted on 24 May 1996.Have I Got News for You Episode Guide > Season 11, Episode 6 TV.com In it, show regular Ian Hislop accused Morgan of having him followed and having his house watched. The conflict escalated and at one point the host, Angus Deayton, asked if they wished to go outside and have a fight. Later on, guest panellist Clive Anderson confronted Morgan commenting, \\"the last time I was rude to you, you sent photographers to my doorstep the next day\\", to which Piers Morgan retorted, \\"You won't see them this time.\\" The audience responded loudly in favour of Hislop.Have I Got News For You BBC2, Series 11 episode 6; Transmitted on 24 May 1996 \\"We're about to start exposing the moon-faced midget\\", Morgan was quoted as saying in 2002, to which Hislop responded, \\"all he's been offering for information about my private life is a ¬£50 reward. My friends think that's not nearly enough.\\" In 2007, Hislop chose Morgan as one of his pet hates on Room 101.Room 101 BBC2, Series 11 episode 6; Transmitted on 9 February 2007Room 101 Episode 11.6 ‚Äì Ian Hislop British Comedy Guide In doing so, Hislop spoke of the history of animosity between himself and Morgan and said that after their exchange on Have I Got News For You (which was shown as a clip), Morgan's reporters were tasked with trying to get gossip on Hislop's private life (including phoning acquaintances of Hislop), and photographers were sent in case Hislop did anything untoward or embarrassing while in their presence. Neither the reporters nor the photographers succeeded. Hislop also said that Morgan had attempted to quell the feud in an article in The Mail on Sunday, saying, \\"The war is over. I'm officially calling an end to hostilities, at least from my end. I'm sure it won't stop him carrying on his 'Piers Moron' stuff\\" (Private Eye, the fortnightly satirical magazine which Hislop edits, regularly calls Morgan 'Piers Moron') Hislop, who was working on a World War I documentary at the time, responded by asking \\"Is that an armistice or an unconditional surrender?\\" Although Paul Merton ‚Äì host of Room 101 at the time and good friend of Hislop ‚Äì agreed to put Morgan into Room 101, he then comically rejected Morgan as being \\"too toxic\\" for Room 101.\\"Room 101, BBC1\\", The Guardian, 10 February 2007 =Other feuds= In October 2003, journalist and television personality Jeremy Clarkson reportedly emptied a glass of water over Morgan during the last flight of Concorde for some photographs published in the Mirror. In March 2004, at the British Press Awards, Clarkson punched Morgan three times during another argument. On 4 February 2014, transgender advocate Janet Mock appeared as a guest on Piers Morgan Live to discuss her memoir, Redefining Realness. After the interview aired, Mock sent a series of tweets criticising Morgan for describing Mock as being \\"formerly a man\\". Morgan responded that he had \\"never been treated in such a disgraceful manner\\" by a guest. On 5 February, Mock appeared as a guest again to debate the dispute. Morgan strongly objected to the Women's March on Washington on 21 January 2017, the day after Trump's inauguration, describing protesters as \\"rabid feminists\\" and the multiple protests as being \\"vacuous\\". The actor Ewan McGregor disagreed with Morgan's statements on the women's march and pulled out of appearing on Good Morning Britain the following Tuesday after discovering Morgan would be interviewing him, along with Reid. Morgan accused McGregor of being a \\"paedophile-loving hypocrite\\" for his past support of Roman Polanski. =Banned guests= In May 2011, Morgan banned actor Hugh Grant from his shows on CNN and ITV after Grant spoke out against the need for the tabloid press. On Twitter he responded: \\"Hugh Grant is now banned, in perpetuity, from @PiersTonight and Life Stories and anything else I ever do. Tedious little man.\\" On 28 March 2012, MTV referred to the bad relations between Morgan and Madonna, reporting that \\"Morgan has apparently felt slighted over the years by Madonna...he claims he was lied to by the singer's publicist\\".\\"Madonna Banned...\\" by Gil Kaufman, MTV, 28 March 2012; retrieved 30 September 2012 In September 2012, it was reported that Morgan had also banned actor Kelsey Grammer.

Despite staff initially expressing enthusiasm for the story it did not appear in the paper, although it did subsequently feature in a South Wales Argus article and on BBC Radio 5 Live in October 1999. On 18 July 2011 Nott was visited by officers of Operation Weeting. He came under criticism for his \\"boasting\\" about phone hacking from Conservative MP Louise Mensch, who has since apologised for these accusations. In July 2011, in a sequence of articles, political blogger Paul Staines alleged that while editor of the Daily Mirror in 2002 Morgan published a story concerning the affair of Sven- Goran Eriksson and Ulrika Jonsson while knowing it to have been obtained by phone hacking. On 20 December 2011, Morgan appeared as a witness by satellite link from the United States at the Leveson Inquiry.\\"Piers Morgan tells Leveson: Daily Mirror did not hack phones\\", BBC News, 20 December 2011 While he said he had no reason to believe that phone hacking had occurred at the Mirror while he was in charge there, he admitted to hearing a recording of an answerphone message left by Paul McCartney for Heather Mills, but refused to \\"discuss where that tape was played or who made [it] ‚Äì it would compromise a source.\\" Appearing as a witness at the same Inquiry on 9 February 2012, Mills was asked under oath if she had ever made a recording of McCartney's phone call or had played it to Morgan; she replied: \\"Never\\". She said that she had never authorised Morgan, or anybody, to access or listen to her voicemails. Mills told the inquiry that Morgan, \\"a man that has written nothing but awful things about me for years\\", would have relished telling the inquiry if she had played a personal voicemail message to him. On 23 May 2012, Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman was a witness at the Leveson Inquiry. He recalled a lunch with the Mirror editor in September 2002 at which Morgan outlined the means of hacking into a mobile phone.Dan Sabbagh and Lisa O'Carroll \\"Piers Morgan told me how to hack a phone, says Jeremy Paxman\\", The Guardian, 23 May 2012. On 28 November 2012, the Channel 4 documentary Taking on the Tabloids, fronted by actor and phone hacking victim Hugh Grant, showed footage from a 2003 interview with Morgan by the singer and phone hacking victim Charlotte Church, during which he explained to her how to avoid answerphone messages being listened to by journalists. He said: \\"You can access ... voicemails by typing in a number. Now, are you really telling me that journalists aren‚Äôt going to do that?\\" On 29 November 2012, the official findings of the Leveson Inquiry were released, in which Lord Justice Leveson said that Morgan's testimony under oath on phone hacking was \\"utterly unpersuasive\\". He stated: \\"[The] evidence does not establish that [Morgan] authorised the hacking of voicemails or that journalists employed by TMG [Trinity Mirror Group] were indulging in this practice ... What it does, however, clearly prove is that he was aware that it was taking place in the press as a whole and that he was sufficiently unembarrassed by what was criminal behaviour that he was prepared to joke about it.\\" On 6 December 2013, Morgan was interviewed, under caution, by police officers from Operation Weeting investigating phone hacking allegations at Mirror Group Newspapers during his tenure as editor.Martin Evans \\"Piers Morgan questioned by police over phone-hacking\\", The Daily Telegraph,.co.uk, 14 February 2014 On 24 September 2014, the Trinity Mirror publishing group admitted for the first time that some of its journalists had been involved in phone hacking and agreed to pay compensation to four people who sued for the alleged hacking of voicemails.Gallivan, Rory and Zekaria, Simon (September 2014) ‚ÄúTrinity Mirror Admits Liability Over Phone Hacking‚Äù, The Wall Street Journal, 24 September 2014.

The BBC reported that it had seen legal papers showing that although the alleged hacking could have taken place as early as 1998, the bulk of the alleged wrongdoing took place in the early 2000s when Morgan was the Daily Mirror editor.BBC News online ‚ÄúPhone-hacking: Trinity Mirror admits liability‚Äù, BBC News online, 24 September 2014 (Retrieved 29 September 2014) The admissions by Trinity Mirror came whilst the London Metropolitan Police investigation into the phone hacking allegations was ongoing. Morgan has always denied any involvement in the practice. =Ofcom complaints= During his career at Good Morning Britain, Morgan has been the subject of thousands of complaints to the British watchdog, Ofcom, relating to controversial comments. In 2015, Morgan was criticised by Ofcom for laughing as a guest repeatedly used the F-word live on air. Although Ofcom did not take action as his co-presenter Susanna Reid quickly apologised, the watchdog expressed concern at his behaviour. In 2016, Ofcom received 70 complaints in relation to comments made by Morgan during interview with Christian magistrate Richard Page about gay marriage, that viewers felt \\"implied Christians were homophobic\\". Ofcom confirmed on 13 April 2016 that Morgan would not be investigated for his comments. On 22 January 2018, during a story about a homeless SAS veteran, who had a petition set up in his name calling on his local council to provide him with social housing, Morgan had refused to read out Herefordshire Council's statement. This was judged by Ofcom to be unfair to the council. On 11 September 2019, Morgan claimed he identified himself as \\"a penguin\\" in response to a news piece relating to gender neutrality, and said \\"the world has gone nuts\\" over gender. This attracted 950 Ofcom complaints from viewers. He was cleared of any wrongdoing in November 2019, and in response, Morgan admitted \\"he was personally quite pleased\\" with having one of the highest number of complaints to any British TV show in 2019. On 21 January 2020, Morgan was accused of racism and was hit by 1,095 Ofcom complaints for his comments relating to a Chinese dairy advert, in which he said \\"He's using ching chong ching milk\\". Morgan also spoke over the advert, saying \\"ching chang cho jo\\". He was accused online of using language which is used to antagonise Chinese people and for mocking the Chinese language. Personal life Morgan married Marion Shalloe, a hospital ward sister, in 1991. The couple had three sons, Albert, Spencer, and Stanley, and divorced in 2008.

He was born in New York City and educated at the College of the City of New York (S.B., 1871) and Columbia University (M.D., 1874). Abbe was most known as a plastic surgeon, and between 1877 and 1884 he served as a surgeon and professor of surgery at the New York Hospital, St. Luke's Hospital, and the New York Babies Hospital. During this time, he would spend summers travelling, and he amassed a large collection of Native American artifacts and archeological materials. He is credited with the lip switch flap, which now bears his name. An Italian surgeon named Sabattini described the flap 60 years earlier. Although Sabattini published his technique, it was printed in a book with a limited circulation. He died of anemia, possibly due to his work handling radium. Radiologist Mrs. Robert Abbe (Catherine Amory Bennett) Abbe was a renowned surgeon and medical pioneer. He was an attending surgeon at Roosevelt Hospital (now Mount Sinai West) in New York, where the plastic surgical laboratory is named for him. He was a lecturer and fellow of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia and Vice President of the Academy of Medicine. He befriended the Curies, and in particular Marie Curie. He collected many photographs of her, documented the production of radium, and explored, with her, the medical uses of radiation and x-rays. In 1904, he introduced the practice of using radiation to treat cancer and founded the science of radiation oncology. In 1927, he founded the Abbe Museum of Native American artifacts. In 1904, after corresponding with Professor and Madame Curie, he visited their laboratories in Paris. Joining in their groundbreaking research, he became the founder of radiation therapy in the United States. He was a vigorous opponent of the use of tobacco which he considered a cause of cancer and reported over 100 cases of smoker's cancer. In later years, at his Bar Harbor summer home, \\"Brook End,\\" Abbe created a garden in whose pool floated two swans ‚Äì Pierre and Marie. Museum Abbe has been called \\"the best-loved summer resident of Bar Harbor.\\" Those who knew him recognized his unique spirit, and many who visit the Museum today feel the specialness of the man and the museum. While summering in Bar Harbor, Abbe was fascinated by the ancient Native American tools found in nearby shell heaps. As he began collecting these artifacts, he realized the need for safe permanent storage. Even during a long illness, probably a result of his exposure to radium, he labored to establish the museum. His dreams of a museum became reality with the help of friends such as George Dorr and Charles Eliot, the founding fathers of Acadia National Park. The dedication of the museum on August 14, 1928 was also a memorial to Robert Abbe. He had died just five months before. Abbe Museum sign post in Sieur de Monts, Maine Abbe amassed a sizeable collection of Native American archaeological material during his summers on Mount Desert Island. Opened in 1928, the Abbe was one of the first museums built in Maine. Its founding coincided with that of the national park, which was established as Lafayette National Park in 1919 and became Acadia in 1929. The Abbe was conceived as a trailside museum to complement the park's offerings. Today it is one of only two remaining private trailside museums in national parks, the other one being the Borax Museum in Death Valley, California. Robert Abbe was a man of many talents and interests. He was a photographer and an artist, painting, creating line drawings and molded maps. His large map \\"The Land of Dawn\\" is on display in the museum. The watercolor sketch on the right, of the museum, was completed by Abbe shortly before his death.

Its author is unknown, but is conventionally referred to as Longinus (; Longƒ©nos) or Pseudo-Longinus. It is regarded as a classic work on aesthetics and the effects of good writing. The treatise highlights examples of good and bad writing from the previous millennium, focusing particularly on what may lead to the sublime. Authorship  The author is unknown. In the 10th-century reference manuscript (Parisinus Graecus 2036), the heading reports \\"Dionysius or Longinus\\", an ascription by the medieval copyist that was misread as \\"by Dionysius Longinus.\\" When the manuscript was being prepared for printed publication, the work was initially attributed to Cassius Longinus (c. 213‚Äì273 AD). Since the correct translation includes the possibility of an author named \\"Dionysius\\", some have attributed the work to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a writer of the 1st century AD. There remains the possibility that the work belongs to neither Cassius Longinus nor Dionysius of Halicarnassus, but, rather, some unknown author writing under the Roman Empire, likely in the 1st century. The error does imply that when the codex was written, the trails of the real author were already lost. Neither author can be accepted as the actual writer of the treatise. Dionysius maintained ideas which are absolutely opposite to those written in the treatise; with Longinus, there are problems with chronology. Among further names proposed, are Hermagoras (a rhetorician who lived in Rome during the 1st century AD), Aelius Theon (author of a work which had many ideas in common with those of On the Sublime), and Pompeius Geminus (who was in epistolary conversation with Dionysius). =Dionysius of Halicarnassus= Dionysius of Halicarnassus wrote under Augustus, publishing a number of works. Dionysius is generally dismissed as the potential author of On the Sublime, since the writing officially attributed to Dionysius differs from the work On the Sublime in style and thought. =Cassius Longinus= Credited with writing a number of literary works, Longinus was disciple of Plotinus, and considered \\"the most distinguished scholar of his day.\\" He received his education at Alexandria and then went to Athens to teach. He later moved to Asia Minor, where he achieved the position of advisor to Zenobia, the queen of Palmyra.Longinus. 9 Vol. Detroit: The Gale Group Inc, 2004. Cassius is a dubious possibility for author of the treatise because he wrote in the 3rd century, and no literature later than the 1st century AD is mentioned (the latest is Cicero, who died in 43 BC) and the work is now usually dated to the early 1st century AD. The work ends with a dissertation on the decay of oratory, a typical subject for the time when authors such as Tacitus, Petronius and Quintilian, who also dealt with the subject, were alive. Cassius was executed by Aurelian, the Roman emperor who conquered Palmyra in 273 AD, on charges of conspiring against the Roman state. This was most likely because of what he had written for Queen Zenobia of Palmyra while she was still in power. Longinus is reported to have written answers for the Queen, which were used in response to Aurelian, the man who would soon rise to power as the Roman emperor. Contents On the Sublime is both a treatise on aesthetics and a work of literary criticism. It is written in an epistolary form and the final part, possibly dealing with public speaking, has been lost. The treatise is dedicated to Posthumius Terentianus, a cultured Roman and public figure, though little else is known of him. On the Sublime is a compendium of literary exemplars, with about 50 authors spanning 1,000 years mentioned or quoted. Along with the expected examples from Homer and other figures of Greek culture, Longinus refers to a passage from Genesis, which is quite unusual for the 1st century: Given his positive reference to Genesis, Longinus has been assumed to be either a Hellenized Jew or readily familiar with the Jewish culture. As such, Longinus emphasizes that, to be a truly great writer, authors must have \\"moral excellence\\". In fact, critics speculate that Longinus avoided publication in the ancient world \\"either by modesty or by prudential motives\\". Moreover, Longinus stresses that transgressive writers are not necessarily shameless fools, even if they take literary risks that seem \\"bold, lawless, and original\\". As for social subjectivity, Longinus acknowledges that complete liberty promotes spirit and hope; according to Longinus, \\"never did a slave become an orator\\". On the other hand, too much luxury and wealth leads to a decay in eloquence‚Äîeloquence being the goal of the sublime writer. =The sublime= Longinus critically applauds and condemns certain literary works as examples of good or bad styles of writing. Longinus ultimately promotes an \\"elevation of style\\" and an essence of \\"simplicity\\". To quote this famous author, \\"the first and most important source of sublimity [is] the power of forming great conceptions.\\" The concept of the sublime is generally accepted to refer to a style of writing that elevates itself \\"above the ordinary\\". Finally, Longinus sets out five sources of sublimity: \\"great thoughts, strong emotions, certain figures of thought and speech, noble diction, and dignified word arrangement\\". The effects of the Sublime are: loss of rationality, an alienation leading to identification with the creative process of the artist and a deep emotion mixed in pleasure and exaltation. An example of sublime (which the author quotes in the work) is a poem by Sappho, the so-called Ode to Jealousy, defined as a \\"Sublime ode\\". A writer's goal is not so much to express empty feelings, but to arouse emotion in her audience. In the treatise, the author asserts that \\"the Sublime leads the listeners not to persuasion, but to ecstasy: for what is wonderful always goes together with a sense of dismay, and prevails over what is only convincing or delightful, since persuasion, as a rule, is within everyone's grasp: whereas, the Sublime, giving to speech an invincible power and [an invincible] strength, rises above every listener\\".On the Sublime 1.4. According to this statement, one could think that the sublime, for Longinus, was only a moment of evasion from reality. But on the contrary, he thought that literature could model a soul, and that a soul could pour itself out into a work of art. In this way the treatise becomes not only a text of literary inquiry, but also one of ethical dissertation, since the Sublime becomes the product of a great soul (, megalophrosunƒìs apƒìchƒìma). The sources of the Sublime are of two kinds: inborn sources (\\"aspiration to vigorous concepts\\" and \\"strong and enthusiastic passion\\") and acquirable sources (rhetorical devices, choice of the right lexicon, and \\"dignified and high composition\\"). =Decay of rhetoric= The author speaks also about the decay of oratory, as arising not only from absence of political freedom but also from the corruption of morals, which together destroy that high spirit which generates the Sublime. Thus the treatise is clearly centred in the burning controversy which raged in the 1st century AD in Latin literature. If Petronius pointed out excess of rhetoric and the pompous, unnatural techniques of the schools of eloquence as the causes of decay, Tacitus was nearer to Longinus in thinking that the root of this decadence was the establishment of Princedom, or Empire, which, though it brought stability and peace, also gave rise to censorship and brought an end to freedom of speech. Thus oratory became merely an exercise in style. =Misleading translations and lost data= Translators have been unable to clearly interpret the text, including the title itself. The \\"sublime\\" in the title has been translated in various ways, to include senses of elevation and excellent style. The word sublime, argues Rhys Roberts, is misleading, since Longinus' objective broadly concerns \\"the essentials of a noble and impressive style\\" than anything more narrow and specific. Moreover, about one-third of the treatise is missing; Longinus' segment on similes, for instance, has only a few words remaining. Matters are further complicated in realizing that ancient writers, Longinus' contemporaries, do not quote or mention the treatise in any way. =Limitations of the writing= Despite Longinus' critical acclaim, his writing is far from perfect. Longinus' occasional enthusiasm becomes \\"carried away\\" and creates some confusion as to the meaning of his text. Furthermore, 18th-century critic Edward Burnaby Greene finds Longinus, at times, to be \\"too refined\\". Greene also claims that Longinus' focus on hyperbolical descriptions is \\"particularly weak, and misapplied.\\" Occasionally, Longinus also falls into a sort of \\"tediousness\\" in treating his subjects. The treatise is also limited in its concentration on spiritual transcendence and lack of focus on the way in which language structures determine the feelings and thoughts of writers. Finally, Longinus' treatise is difficult to explain in an academic setting, given the difficulty of the text and lack of \\"practical rules of a teachable kind.\\" =Writing style and rhetoric= Despite its faults, the treatise remains critically successful because of its \\"noble tone,\\" \\"apt precepts,\\" \\"judicious attitude,\\" and \\"historical interests\\". One of the reasons why it is so unlikely that known ancient critics wrote On the Sublime is because the treatise is composed so differently from any other literary work. Since Longinus' rhetorical formula avoids dominating his work, the literature remains \\"personal and fresh,\\" unique in its originality. Longinus rebels against the popular rhetoric of the time by implicitly attacking ancient theory in its focus on a detailed criticism of words, metaphors, and figures. More explicitly, in refusing to judge tropes as entities unto themselves, Longinus promotes the appreciation of literary devices as they relate to passages as a whole. Essentially, Longinus, rare for a critic of his time, focuses more on \\"greatness of style\\" than \\"technical rules.\\" Despite his criticism of ancient texts, Longinus remains a \\"master of candor and good-nature\\". Moreover, the author invents striking images and metaphors, writing almost lyrically at times. In general, Longinus appreciates, and makes use of, simple diction and bold images. As far as the language is concerned, the work is certainly a unicum because it is a blend of expressions of the Hellenistic Koine Greek to which are added elevated constructions, technical expressions, metaphors, classic and rare forms which produce a literary pastiche at the borders of linguistic experimentation. =Influences= In reading On the Sublime, critics have determined that the ancient philosopher and writer Plato is a \\"great hero\\" to Longinus. Not only does Longinus come to Plato's defense, but he also attempts to raise his literary standing in opposition to current criticisms. Another influence on the treatise can be found in Longinus' rhetorical figures, which draw from theories by a 1st-century BC writer, Caecilius of Calacte. Historical criticism and use of On the Sublime *10th century - The original treatise, before translation, is copied into a medieval manuscript and attributed to \\"Dionysius or Longinus.\\" *13th century - A Byzantine rhetorician makes obscure references to what may be Longinus' text. *16th century - The treatise is ignored by scholars until it is published by Francis Robortello in Basel, in 1554, and Niccol√≤ da Falgano, in 1560. The original work is attributed to \\"Dionysius Longinus\\" and most European countries receive translations of the treatise. *17th century - Sublime effects become a desired end of much Baroque art and literature, and the rediscovered work of \\"Longinus\\" goes through half a dozen editions in the 17th century. It is Boileau's 1674 translation of the treatise into French that really starts its career in the history of criticism. Despite its popularity, some critics claim that the treatise was too \\"primitive\\" to be truly understood by a \\"too civilized\\" 17th-century audience. *18th century - William Smith's 1739 translation of Longinus on the Sublime established the translator and once more brought the work into prominence. Longinus' text reaches its height in popularity. In England, critics esteem Longinus' principles of composition and balance second only to Aristotle's Poetics. Edmund Burke's A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful and Immanuel Kant's Critique of the Power of JudgmentClewis, Robert R. (2009). The Kantian Sublime and the Revelation of Freedom. Cambridge University Press, pp. 12-13. owe a debt to Longinus' concept of the sublime, and the category passes into intellectual discourse. As \\"Longinus\\" says, \\"The effect of elevated language upon an audience is not persuasion but transport,\\" a fitting sentiment for Romantic thinkers and writers who reach beyond logic, to the wellsprings of the Sublime. At the same time, the Romantics gain some contempt for Longinus, given his association with the \\"rules\\" of classical poets. Such contempt is ironic, given the widespread influence of Longinus on the shaping of 18th-century criticism. *19th century - Early in the 19th century, doubts arise to the authorship of the treatise. Thanks to Italian scholar Amati, Cassius Longinus is no longer assumed to be the writer of On the Sublime. Simultaneously, the critical popularity of Longinus' work diminishes greatly; though the work is still in use by scholars, it is rarely quoted. Despite the lack of public enthusiasm, editions and translations of On the Sublime are published at the end of the century. *20th century - Although the text is still little quoted, it maintains its status, apart from Aristotle's Poetics, as \\"the most delightful of all the critical works of classical antiquity.\\" Also see Neil Hertz's essay on Longinus in his book, The End of the Line. Hertz is in part responding to Thomas Weiskel's book The Romantic Sublime, probably the most influential recent account of British and German Romantic attitudes towards the Sublime of both Burke and Longinus. Laura Quinney treats the attractions grim demystification in analyses of Longinus, particularly Weiskel's. Jonathan Culler has an appreciation of Hertz on Longinus in \\"The Hertzian Sublime.\\" Anne Carson and Louis Marin have occasion to discuss Longinus as well and Harold Bloom and William J. Kennedy have significant accounts of his work. William Carlos Williams also uses three lines from the work as an epigraph to the Prologue to Kora in Hell. German film director Werner Herzog claims to have an affinity with the work of Longinus, in a talk entitled \\"On the Absolute, the Sublime and Ecstatic Truth\\", presented in Milan. Herzog says that he thinks of Longinus as a good friend and considers that Longinus's notions of illumination has a parallel in some moments in his films. He quotes from Longinus: \\"For our soul is raised out of nature through the truly sublime, sways with high spirits, and is filled with proud joy, as if itself had created what it hears.\\" Notes Further reading  Martin Fritz, Vom Erhabenen.

Originally named Green Jell√∂, the band changed its name due to legal pressure from Kraft Foods, the owners of the Jell-O trademark, who claimed that it was an infringement of their trademark. Despite the spelling difference, the new name and the old are pronounced identically. Known for sophomoric humor, theatrical performances and intentionally crude musicianship, Green Jell√ø has had hundreds of members during the band's existence, with vocalist Bill Manspeaker the only consistent member throughout.Green Jelly Currently Has 781 Active Members. Let Us Explain, Brett Callwood, Retrieved from LAWeekly.com, December 30, 2017 The band's early 1990s lineup included drummer Danny Carey, who went on to be the drummer in Tool. Their biggest hit was the single \\"Three Little Pigs\\",Green Jelly Billboard Chart History, Retrieved from Billboard.com, September 25, 2017 adapted from the fairy tale. History Bill Manspeaker, a resident of Hollywood, California, formed Green Jell√ø in 1981 as Green Jell√∂, a four-piece comedy-punk band. As most of the band's members were poor musicians at the time, they billed themselves as \\"The World's Worst Band\\" and emphasized bizarre theatrics, power chords, and self- deprecating humor. The name, which was suggested by a friend of the band, was chosen because the band members felt lime-flavored Jell-O was the worst Jell-O flavor, and Manspeaker believed this also reflected the band's talents. The band began playing punk shows around Buffalo, New York, and became notorious for their onstage antics and live theatrics. The band were musical novices to the degree that the bassist had to color-code the frets on his bass guitar so that he could memorize finger placement by color. =Early career (1981‚Äì1984)= One of the band's earliest shows was held in a Masonic Temple in Kenmore. During the show, members of the rowdy audience broke into the venue's kitchen mid-concert and found a full case of ice cream sandwiches, which they proceeded to throw at the band. By the end of the night the stage was ruined and Green Jell√∂ had to reimburse the venue for damages and cleaning. Another early gig at a YMCA also ended in the band having to pay for clean-up; this time for spilling a large amount of fake blood on the carpets. The band acquired a reputation as a \\"food-throwing rock band\\", and audience members started bringing their own green Jell-O to shows, which they would then throw at the band. The group was eventually banned from Buffalo music club McVans for an act that included smashing televisions on stage with a sledgehammer. They temporarily changed their name to AJP (American Jell-O Party), copying the Sex Pistols' trick of changing their name to \\"SPOTS\\" (Sex Pistols On Tour Secretly) in order to play shows in places where they were banned, including McVans. This proved successful, and they got back into McVans only to repeat their destructive conduct and be banned once again. Following this incident, the name was changed back to Green Jell√∂ and they attempted to book different venues. Green Jell√ø found a supporter in local punk club \\"The Continental\\" owner Bud Burke. Burke let the band play his club on a regular basis despite the bizarre live shows. Implements of sadomasochism, such as inversion boots and wheels of torture were employed and on some occasions the band incompetently played an entire show of Led Zeppelin covers. As word spread, the shows began to regularly sell out. In 1984 Green Jell√∂ opened for the Ramones at a Buffalo State College summertime outdoor free concert, and the band (who as the opening act had their equipment set up in front of the Ramones' gear) were pelted by the audience with the usual Jell-O, whipped cream and pudding. In the end, not only were Green Jell√∂ covered, but so too was the Ramones' equipment. Years later in an interview with New York Rocker magazine, Joey Ramone singled out Green Jell√∂ as the worst band to ever open for the Ramones. =Let It Be (1984‚Äì1987)= In 1984 Green Jell√∂ released Let It Be, an 8-song 7-inch 45 EP, on their own label, American Jello Parti Productions, Inc. The cover artwork (designed by Manspeaker) was a parody of The Beatles' Let It Be album cover. Recorded in Bill's bedroom and at a local band rehearsal hall, the album featured the theme song \\"Green Jell√∂ Theme Song\\" (the band's initial manifesto/call to arms), as well as early songs \\"I've Got Poo-Poo On My Shoe\\" (later \\"Shitman\\"), \\"Whip Me Teenage Babe\\" (later \\"House Me Teenage Rave\\"), \\"Hill, Hill\\", \\"Do the Howie\\" (a song about the bumbling rent-a-cop at the band's high school alma mater, Kenmore West High School, sung to the tune of Van McCoy's \\"The Hustle\\"), the one-second long \\"Icrog\\", \\"The Ice Cream Song\\", and \\"I'll Buy You Any Major Appliance You Want Baby, Ooo Ooo\\". Let It Be was limited to a release of 500 and only released picture sleeves were simply a green tinted photocopy of the original cardboard sleeve. The original hard-cardboard sleeves are now highly sought after by collectors. The record also included a multi-panel lyric sheet (designed by Manspeaker). The back cover of the picture sleeve features an actual endorsement from Kiss member Paul Stanley, whom Green Jell√∂ had met during that time. The Let It Be EP was also given away at a record release party in which fans had to climb a \\"Green Jell√∂ Tree\\" in front of the club to claim a free record. The band actually taped a large amount of 45s up in the tree in the front of the club. The band's high propensity for absurd, illogical stunts such as this soon became the norm. Around this time, Green Jell√∂ started turning up for gigs in multiple stretch limos. The band just thought it was an absurd, funny thing for an admittedly horrible band to do. Other weird things Green Jell√∂ used to do on stage during early Buffalo shows included making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on their chests, and ironing clothes on stage while singing. The band began to get more and more (faux) outrageous onstage, eventually involving fake torture, whipping and women. Often the band would play new songs, so that the audience would not know how badly they were messing up. Crazy stage names were adopted, multiple members joined. Green Jell√∂ appeared on the TV show The Gong Show. Trying hard to sound bad, the band was \\"gonged\\" quickly, but had achieved its goal of national TV exposure. =Road to success (1987‚Äì1991)= After the local success in Buffalo, many of the members relocated to Hollywood, California. In 1987, while working at Tower Records on Sunset Boulevard, they reformed the band, and quickly became a fixture in the Hollywood underground scene. Their first Los Angeles show was at The Central (which later became the Viper Room on Sunset Blvd), playing a show organized by Sylvia Massy, who would later produce two of their albums. In 1988, Bill and the band met Gwar, and an instant friendship was formed over their mutual love of costumes and props. After the initial meeting, Green Jell√∂ decided to ditch their uncomfortable and dangerous papier mach√©/chicken wire costume heads in favor of the more user friendly foam rubber heads that Gwar had been making. They garbage picked cushions from abandoned Hollywood couches and carved their new characters such as \\"Shitman\\" (a giant, walking corn-filled poop monster), \\"Cowgod\\", \\"Rock n Roll Pumpkin\\", and \\"Satan's Ham\\". The band's live show became an over-the-top adventure in absurdity, now consisting of usually 20 members onstage. In 1989, Green Jell√∂ released its second album, Triple Live M√∂ther G√∂√∂se at Budokan, on February 29 Records, which was recorded in a garage with producer Sylvia Massy in about the same amount of time it takes to play it. A rare video was also released for this album with music videos for each song. It featured a much more defined sound, as well as far better production and songwriting. The band began to tighten up musically, enlisting drummer Danny Carey (later in Tool), as well as bassist Bill Tutton (King Dot), guitarists Marc Levinthal (Pippi Rockstocking), Steven Shenar (Sven Seven), C.J. Buscaglia (Jesus Quisp) and Bernie Peaks (Bernie Vicious), along with bassist Rootin' Bloomquist. The band also had 7 vocalists, including Bill Manspeaker (Moronic Dictator, Shitman, Marshall \\"Duh\\" Staxxx), Joe Cannizzaro (Dunderhead), Keith Matherne (Keni Logginz), Gary Helsinger (Hotsy Menshot, Pi√±ata Head), Greg Reynard (Reason Clean, Toucan Son of Sam) and Maynard James Keenan (Billy Bob). The band also had two female backup singers/floor tom drummers, Kim O'Donnell (Sadistica), and Caroline Jester (Jella Tin). Kim O'Donnell also designed and created all the artwork, covers, comics, and logos for the band. =Cereal Killer (1991‚Äì1993)= In 1991, the band approached BMG subsidiary label Zoo Entertainment, and claiming they were the \\"world's first video-only band\\", offered to make the entire project (all music, videos, artwork, etc.) entirely on their own for the unheard-of sum of $50,000. Zoo signed them on the spot. The only problem was, it had been a bluff, and the band had never made a \\"video album\\" before. After buying a video camera, some wood and some lights, the band set out to learn on the job, and in Fall 1992 delivered their third album Cereal Killer, again produced by Sylvia Massy, recorded at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California. The Cereal Killer album came with the long-form video release, consisting of music videos for each song, as well as a behind-the-scenes feature. The video album slowly gained a reputation in the underground, and would eventually go on to sell over 100,000 copies. Their break came when a radio station in Seattle, Washington, The X KXRX, played \\"Three Little Pigs\\" as a joke, but instead the station's phones lit up and it became a local hit. This caused Zoo to issue the EP Green Jell√∂ SUXX, consisting of four songs from Cereal Killer, which in turn led to \\"The Three Little Pigs\\" becoming a hit on The Box (A pay-per-play cable-TV jukebox network). By early 1993, the song was gaining airplay around the country, and after appearing on MTV Headbanger's Ball, everything exploded. MTV added the video and the full-length audio album Cereal Killer Soundtrack was finally released in March 1993. The video for \\"The Three Little Pigs\\" was directed by Fred Stuhr (who also directed Tool's \\"Sober\\" video), and it featured a claymation rendition of the classic fairy tale with modern twists, such as pot-smoking pigs, an appearance by Rambo, and a Harley Davidson-riding wolf. The video was an instant hit on MTV and was No. 17 for most of the summer of 1993 in the US, receiving both an MTV music award and Billboard music award nomination. Meanwhile, the song entered the UK Singles Chart at a peak position of No. 5. As a result of \\"The Three Little Pigs\\" video, the Cereal Killer Soundtrack album went gold in the US, New Zealand, and Canada, as well as platinum in Australia, eventually selling over 14 million songs worldwide. Green Jell√∂ spent almost a year touring the US and Europe in support of the Cereal Killer Soundtrack. In 1993 they released the single \\"Electric Harley House (Of Love)\\", the video featured Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley from KISS and also featured some of the band in KISS-inspired costumes. Later in 1993, Green Jell√ø released a single that was not to be included on any of their full-length albums: a duet with Hulk Hogan performing Gary Glitter's \\"I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)\\", which scored them a third Top 40 hit in the UK. =333 and late career (1994‚Äì1995)= In 1994, Green Jell√ø began a joint venture with $4 million from their parent company, BMG Music, to open Green Jell√ø Studios, an audio and visual production house on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, California. The production house made music videos for other artists, as well as production pieces for TV and film. It was here that Green Jell√ø recorded and filmed their 4th album, 333. Focusing more on the musical side, and even featuring non-comedy songs, the album was a more eclectic gathering, ranging from thrash metal to grunge rock to dance music. Due to problems with the record company and virtually no promotion, the album failed to make waves. The long form video for the album was never properly released, and is extremely hard to find. The album spawned \\"The Bear Song\\" which appears in the Farrelly Brothers film Dumb and Dumber, but failed to chart. Though the new video album was never properly released, it did receive a 1995 Grammy nomination for best long-form video. Also in 1994, the band wrote and produced the soundtrack for the Acclaim Entertainment video game Spider-Man & Venom: Maximum Carnage. Due to the state of video game music technology at that time, the soundtrack was not recorded music, but a computerized rendition of the songs. Portions of the soundtrack also made an appearance in Maximum Carnage's sequel, Spider-Man & Venom: Separation Anxiety. In the same year, Green Jell√ø appeared as themselves in an episode of the Fantastic Four animated series called \\"Super Skrull\\", in which The Thing records a music video for a song about his catch phrase‚Äî\\"It‚Äôs Clobberin‚Äô Time!\\" In 1995, the band recorded an album's worth of brand-new material for Zoo Entertainment, but due to ongoing problems with the struggling label which would eventually lead to it being merged with Volcano Entertainment in 1996, the album was not released. However, this material would be released 14 years later in the form of Musick to Insult Your Intelligence By. Although Green Jell√ø never officially broke up, the members of the band's core Cereal Killer/333 lineup (with the exception of Manspeaker) gradually started going separate ways afterwards. Green Jell√ø also released a cover of \\"Born to Be Wild\\" in 1995, for a movie soundtrack of the same name. =Reunion and Musick to Insult Your Intelligence By (2008‚Äì2009)= On February 19, 2008, music news website Blabbermouth.net announced that Green Jell√ø was reuniting and that a possible U.S. tour was in the works. The band also re-released the Cereal Killer and 333 video/albums on a self-produced DVD with Originology Records, which were only sold at their concerts. In late August, the band announced via their Myspace page that they would again be going on tour in the Fall. Several \\"new\\" songs became available via their Myspace page, as well as information on a new Green Jell√∂ DVD and CD. Green Jell√ø finally released Musick to Insult Your Intelligence By on October 13, 2009. The album was actually a collection of the \\"lost demos\\" from 1995 for the band's 3rd album before being dropped by Zoo Entertainment, and was pulled from a DAT safety that Gary Helsinger had kept. It features the same lineup as Cereal Killer and 333 except for C.J. Buscaglia and Roy Staley (replaced by Rob Brown), who had already left the band at the time of recording. =Touring and new releases (2010‚Äìpresent)= On March 25, 2010, Green Jell√ø embarked on the Parental Advisory tour with headliners Nashville Pussy and the cult comedy metal band Psychostick. The tour ended in Phoenix, Arizona on May 30, 2010. In May 2010, Shell Gasoline released a commercial featuring \\"The Bear Song\\" from the album \\"333\\". On June 26, 2010 Green Jell√ø played the \\"American Skate Fest\\" in Rutland, Ohio with headliners Gwar. Then the band played four shows on The Vans Warped Tour on the \\"Punk Rock Legends\\" stage. The band toured extensively the rest of the year on the \\"Shell Gas Commercial Tour\\" playing in over 130 cities throughout the United States. The band took most of 2011 off, only playing select shows at The Vans Warped Tour and The Skatopia Bowl Bash. As of 2012, Bill Manspeaker has once again brought Green Jell√ø back to life to embark on the \\"Green Jelly Jet Set Tour 2012\\" touring throughout the United States and eventually the world. In 2019, this tour was ongoing and only broke for brief periods of time, up to three weeks. While talking to members of the local opening bands at shows, Bill Manspeaker realized that a lot of these people grew up listening to, and learning how to play along to, Green Jell√ø songs. This gave him the idea to set up groups of musicians across the country as Green Jell√ø franchises. The concept would allow Manspeaker to fly to a state one weekend, meet his franchise band at the airport, play three shows, and fly home before starting the process all over again the next weekend in a new state with a new frachise band. As of 2019, using this model, Jell√ø currently had over 850 band members across the USA, Canada, Mexico, and Europe. Funded by a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2015, the band released a DVD on December 1, 2016. Toronto filmmaker & Green Jell√∂ superfan Rob Gabriele joined, toured, and documented the band and their crazy antics while on stage at seedy dive bars. The toured throughout 2017 in support of the film and its soundtrack. On June 28, 2018 \\"Green Jelly Suxx Live Soundtrack\\" was released via \\"Enjoy The Ride Records\\". The release is limited to only 500 total copies on 12\\" vinyl, available in three different variations. A clear with Green splatter version limited to 100 copies, and a Three Little Pigs version and Maximum Carnage version limited to 200 copies each. As a bonus each copy also includes a 12\\"x18\\" poster, the DVD video, and a special re-release of the rare and highly sought after 1984 EP \\"Let It Be\\", pressed on Green Jelly 7\\" vinyl. After 22 years, Green Jell√ø released a new music video. Fr3t√∂ F33t was written by bassist Mike Snyder, with a vocal performance by Bill Manspeaker. The music video was first seen on YouTube, and 1,000 CD copies were sold via the Green Jell√ø Facebook page. Bill Manspeaker, Lazy D, Mike Snyder, and a few members of the Eastern Canadian chapter, appeared on Trailer Park Boys: Park After Dark. The Swearnet exclusive podcast featured Manspeaker being interviewed, after a night of hard partying. In October 2019, Green Jell√ø joined the Insane Clown Posse on the Wicked Weekends Tour. The tour ended with Insane Clown Posse‚Äôs annual Hallowicked show on October 31. Green Jell√ø released \\"Silence of the Sponge,\\" a macabre cover/parody of the theme to SpongeBob SquarePants The song was included on a self titled EP. The EP also featured FR3TO F33T, and Obey the Cowgod (live). As reported by World Star, in November 2019, Green Jell√ø performed a show in London, Ontario. After the show, the band was not paid by the promoter, Markus McLean. The following day, Bill Manspeaker, along with members of the band, showed up at the promoters home to demand their money. The incident was broadcast live on Facebook Live, and later uploaded to YouTube. Band members Current *Bill Manspeaker - lead vocals (1981‚Äì1995, 2008‚Äìpresent) Former *Scott Rozell - bass guitar (1981‚Äì1995) *Maynard James Keenan - guitar, vocals (1990-1993) *C.J Buscaglia - vocals, guitar (1989‚Äì1995) *Danny Carey - drums (1989‚Äì1994) Timeline Lawsuits At the height of the band's fame, Green Jell√∂ was plagued by multiple lawsuits. In 1992, they were sued by Kraft Foods for trademark infringement. Due to the name \\"Jell√∂\\", and more so the band slogan \\"GREEN JELL√ñ SUCKS!\\", the band was forced to change their name to Green Jell√ø, with an umlaut over the Y. This umlaut, according to the band, \\"changed the 'Y' sound to an 'O' sound\\". The band was forced to re-release their album and long form video, as well as change all merchandise carrying the \\"Jell√∂\\" name. Later in 1992, Green Jell√ø was sued by the Kellogg Company for trademark infringement of their Toucan Sam character, as well as others. The cover of Cereal Killer (both album and video) depicted \\"Toucan Son of Sam\\" the \\"Cereal Killer\\" that kills other cereal characters, such as Snap, Crackle and Pop, the Trix Rabbit, and Lucky the Leprechaun in extremely gruesome fashion. The band were forced to change the cover art (originally depicting Toucan Son of Sam), as well as place a white box in the center of the new cover which stated \\"Not affiliated with or endorsed by Kraft/General Foods\\". Additionally, the band was forced to remove the music video for the song \\"Cereal Killer\\" from the long form home video release. On the album 333, Toucan Son of Sam is referred to as \\"Pelican Son of Sam\\", and \\"Pelican Pete\\" at subsequent stage shows. In 1993, Green Jell√ø was also sued by the management of Metallica for partial use of their song \\"Enter Sandman\\" in the song \\"Electric Harley House (Of Love)\\". The bass and rhythm guitars in the solo section of the song play a riff close to that of \\"Enter Sandman\\", and even though the band mentions it in lyric immediately after the riff, the band was forced to remove the part from the later CD versions of Cereal Killer and pull the music video from MTV. Connections with Tool * Danny Carey from Tool was a member of Green Jell√ø for five years, and played drums on the album Cereal Killer as Danny Long Legs. He is also featured in the video for \\"Electric Harley House (Of Love)\\", among others. * Maynard James Keenan, vocalist for Tool, recorded a song with Green Jell√ø. On the song \\"Three Little Pigs\\" Maynard sang backing vocals (he sings the falsetto \\"Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin\\"). Maynard is also mentioned in the song \\"Green Jell√∂ Theme Song\\" in the lyric \\"Maynard, and Poopie‚Äîthey're both insane!\\" and appears in the music video for the 333 album song \\"Slave Boy\\". * The song \\"Message to Harry Manback\\" on Tool's √Ünima is an actual message left on Gary Helsinger's (Hotsy Menshot) answering machine by a former friend from Italy, whom Gary had just kicked out of his apartment for stealing his roommate's belongings. \\"Harry Manback\\" is a reference to a routine from the late comedian Bill Hicks. Maynard James Keenan and Danny Carey were both roommates of Bill Manspeaker during Green Jell√∂, and Gary was later roommates with Maynard as well as Billy Howerdel of A Perfect Circle. * Tool guitarist Adam Jones had worked in make-up and practical effects on movies including Ghostbusters II, Jurassic Park and others, and helped Green Jell√ø members develop their costumes. Jones has stated that Tool vocalist Maynard James Keenan met Green Jell√ø through his work with the band. * Tool was signed to the same label as Green Jell√ø, the now-defunct Zoo Entertainment. * Tool's songs \\"Jerk-Off\\" (live) and \\"Cold and Ugly\\" (live) from their first EP were recorded on December 31, 1991 at the Green Jell√∂ loft. Tool EP liner notes Musical style Green Jell√ø has been described as a comedy rock band, fused with heavy metal, and punk rock.

Although often ascribed to Greek mythology, the name probably arises from an unknown copyist's misreading of a commentary by a fourth-century scholar, Lactantius Placidus. The concept itself can be traced back to the original misread term demiurge. Etymology The origins of the name Demogorgon are not entirely clear, though the most prevalent scholarly view now considers it to be a misreading of the Greek Œ¥Œ∑ŒºŒπŒøœÖœÅŒ≥œåŒΩ (dƒìmiourg√≥n, accusative case form of Œ¥Œ∑ŒºŒπŒøœÖœÅŒ≥œåœÇ, 'demiurge') based on the manuscript variations in the earliest known explicit reference in Lactantius Placidus (Jahnke 1898, Sweeney 1997, Solomon 2012). Boccaccio, in his influential Genealogia Deorum Gentilium, cites a now lost work by Theodontius, and that master's acknowledged Byzantine source, \\"Pronapides the Athenian\\", as authority for the idea that Demogorgon is the antecedent of all the gods. Art historian Jean Seznec concludes that \\"Demogorgon is a grammatical error, become god.\\" The name variants cited by Jahnke include the Latin \\"demoirgon\\", \\"emoirgon\\", \\"demogorgona\\", \\"demogorgon\\", with the first critical editor Friedrich Lindenbrog (Fridericus Tiliobroga) having conjectured \\"Œ¥Œ∑ŒºŒπŒøœÖœÅŒ≥œåŒΩ\\" as the prototype in 1600. Various other theories suggest that the name is derived from a combination of the Greek words Œ¥Œ±ŒØŒºœâŒΩ daimon ('spirit' given the Christian connotations of 'demon' in the early Middle Ages)‚Äîor, less likely Œ¥·øÜŒºŒøœÇ d√™mos (\\"people\\")‚Äîand Œ≥ŒøœÅŒ≥œåœÇ gorg√≥s (\\"quick\\") or ŒìŒøœÅŒ≥œéŒΩ Gorg·πìn, the Ancient Greek monsters first attested in Hesiod's Theogony.Hes. Th. 270-282 Derivation and history Demogorgon is first mentioned in the commentary on Statius's ThebaidStatius, Thebaid iv.500-518, a passage often linked (see below) to Lucan, Pharsalia vi.744‚Äì49, where, however, Demogorgon is not specified. See notes to Lucan 6.744 in G. Viansino's edition (Mondadori, 1995). often attributed in manuscripts to a Lactantius Placidus, (c. 350‚Äì400 AD). The Lactantius Placidus commentary became the most common medieval commentary on the poem by Statius and is transmitted in most early editions up to 1600.H. Anderson, The Manuscripts of Statius (Arlington, VA, 2009), vol. 2, pp. 83‚Äì85 and 191‚Äì202 The commentary has been attributed incorrectly to a different Lactantius, the Christian author Lucius Caelius Firmianus Lactantius, even though the commentator appears to have been Mithraic.J. Fran√ßois, Le Scoliaste de la Th√©ba√Øde de Stace, M√©moire de licence, Li√®ge, 1936, p. 82. R.D. Sweeney (ed., Lactantii Placidi in Statii Thebaida commentarii libri XII (Stuttgart/Leipzig: Teubner) 1997) also indicates that another Placidus, a Christian grammarian, is not to be confused with this Lactantius: glossae Placidi (ut uidetur, Christiani) nullo modo auctori nostro sunt adscribendae (p. viii). The name Demogorgon is introduced in a discussion of Thebaid 4.516, which mentions \\"the supreme being of the threefold world\\" (triplicis mundi summum). In one manuscript, the author says of Statius, Dicit deum Demogorgona summum, cuius scire nomen non licet (\\"He is speaking of the Demogorgon, the supreme god, whose name it is not permitted to know\\", or perhaps \\"He is speaking of a god, the supreme Demogorgon\\"). Prior to Lactantius, there is no mention of the supposed \\"Demogorgon\\" anywhere by any writer, pagan or Christian. However, as noted above, there are several different manuscript traditions, including one that gives \\"demoirgon\\", which has been taken by most critical editors to indicate some form of misconstruction of the Greek dƒìmiourgon. Jahnke thus restores the text to read \\"He is speaking of the Demiurge, whose name it is not permitted to know\\". However, this phantom word in one of the manuscript traditions took on a life of its own among later scholars. In the Early Middle Ages, Demogorgon is mentioned in the tenth-century Adnotationes super Lucanum, a series of short notes to Lucan's Pharsalia that are included in the Commenta Bernensia, the \\"Berne Scholia on Lucan\\".\\"The Berne Scholia\\"; Adnotationes super Lucanum, vi.746, are mentioned in Daniel Ogden's Magic, Witchcraft, and Ghosts in the Greek and Roman Worlds, Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 198. By the late Middle Ages, the reality of a primordial \\"Demogorgon\\" was so well fixed in the European imagination that \\"Demogorgon's son Pan\\" became a bizarre variant reading for \\"Hermes' son Pan\\" in one manuscript tradition of Boccaccio's Genealogia Deorum gentilium (\\"Genealogies of the Gods\\":1.3‚Äì4 and 2.1), misreading a line in Ovid's Metamorphoses. Boccaccio's Demogorgon is mentioned as a \\"primal\\" god in quite a few Renaissance texts, and impressively glossed \\"Demon-Gorgon,\\" i.e., \\"Terror-Demon\\" or \\"God of the Earth\\". The French historian and mythographer Jean Seznec, for instance, now determines in Demogorgon an allusion to the Demiurge (\\"Craftsman\\" or \\"Maker\\") of Plato's Timaeus. For a remarkable early text identifying Ovid's Demiurge (1/1, here) as \\"sovereign Demogorgon\\", see the paraphrase of Metamorphoses I in Abraham France, The third part of the Countesse of Pembrokes Yuychurch (London, 1592), sig. A2v.\\"Dr Daniel Kinney, \\"Ovid Illustrated: The Renaissance Reception of Ovid in Image and Text\\" linked below. In literature Demogorgon was taken up by Christian writers as a demon of Hell: Note, however, Milton does not refer to the inhabitants of Hell, but of an unformed region where Chaos rules with Night. In Milton's epic poem Satan passes through this region while traveling from Hell to Earth. Demogorgon's name was earlier invoked by Faustus in Scene III of Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus (1590) when the eponymous Doctor summons Mephistopheles with a Latin incantation. The sixteenth-century Dutch demonologist Johann Weyer described Demogorgon as the master of fate in hell's hierarchy. According to Ariosto's lesser work I Cinque Canti, Ludovico Ariosto - Opere minori (tomo I) Demogorgon has a splendid temple palace in the Imavo mountains (today's Himalaya) where every five years the Fates and genii are all summoned to appear before him and give an account of their actions. They travel through the air in various strange conveyances, and it is no easy matter to distinguish between their convention and a Witches' Sabbath. When elements of Ariosto's poem supplied Philippe Quinault's libretto for Jean- Baptiste Lully's opera Roland, performed at Versailles, 8 January 1685, Demogorgon was king of the fairies and master of ceremonies. Demogorgon also is mentioned in the Book II of the epic poem El Bernardo written in Mexico by Bernardo de Balbuena and published in Spain in 1624. The passage tells how the fairy, \\"Alcina\\", visits Demogorgon in his infernal palace: > Aqu√≠ Demogorgon est√° sentado > en su banco fatal, cuyo decreto > de las supremas causas es guardado > por inviolable y celestial preceto. > Las parcas y su estambre delicado > a cuyo huso el mundo est√° sujeto, > la fea muerte y el vivir l√∫cido > y el negro lago del oscuro olvido > ‚Äî (Libro II, estrofa 19) Demogorgon is mentioned in Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene: > A bold bad man, that dar'd to call by name > Great Gorgon, Prince of darknesse and dead night, > At which Cocytus quakes, and Styx is put to flight. > ‚Äî (Canto I, stanza 37) and: > Downe in the bottome of the deepe Abysse > Where Demogorgon in dull darknesse pent, > Farre from the view of Gods and heauens blis, > The hideous Chaos keepes, their dreadfull dwelling is. > ‚Äî (Book IV, Canto ii, stanza 47) Demogorgon is the central character in Voltaire's 1756 short story \\"Plato's Dream\\" - a \\"lesser superbeing\\" who was responsible for creating the planet Earth. He is also the protagonist of an opera Il Demogorgone, ovvero il filosofo confuso (\\"Demogorgon, or the Confused Philosopher\\" by Vincenzo Righini (1786) with a libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte, which originally was written for Mozart.\\"Non tardar amato bene,\\" left incomplete by Mozart was inserted in Da Ponte's next project, Il Demogorgone (D. Heartz, \\"Mozart and Da Ponte\\", The Musical Quarterly, 1995); the question \\" how did Righini wind up setting a text written for Mozart, and how could a text designed for a different opera fit successfully into II demogorgone?\\" is addressed in J Stone, \\"Mozart's Theory of Opera, 13 October 1781\\" The Musical Times, 1991. In Moby-Dick, the first mate of the ship, Pequod, Starbuck, describes the white whale as the demogorgon of the ship's \\"heathen crew\\" (see ch. XXXVIII, paragraph 2). Demogorgon also appears as a character in Percy Bysshe Shelley's Prometheus Unbound. In this lyrical drama, Demogorgon is the offspring of Jupiter and Thetis who eventually dethrones Jupiter. It is never mentioned whether Demogorgon, portrayed as a dark, shapeless spirit, is female or male. The theory of Demogorgon's name originating from Greek demos and gorgos may be the foundation for its use in this text as an allusion to a politically active and revolutionary populace.Paul Foot. Red Shelley. p. 194 Shelley's allusions to the French Revolution further support this. In the poem \\"Demogorgon\\" by √Ålvaro de Campos, the writer is afraid of becoming mad by learning the true nature and unveiling the mystery of life.Poema: Demogorgon - √Ålvaro de Campos - Poesia/Poemas no Citador, citador.pt In gaming =Dungeons & Dragons= In the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game, Demogorgon is a powerful demon prince. He is known as the Prince of Demons, a self-proclaimed title, but one that is acknowledged by mortals and even his fellow demons because of his power and influence. Demogorgon was also named as one of the greatest villains in D&D; history by the final print issue of Dragon. He is depicted as an , reptilian (or amphibious) hermaphroditic tanar'ri with a somewhat humanoid form. Two mandrill or hyena heads sprout from his twin snake-like necks, and his arms end in long tentacles. His two heads have individual minds. Demogorgon first appeared in the original edition of Dungeons and Dragons, in Eldritch Wizardry (1976), and has appeared in every subsequent edition of the game.Gygax, Gary. Monster Manual (TSR, 1977)Sargent, Carl. Monster Mythology (TSR, 1992)Cook, Monte. Book of Vile Darkness (Wizards of the Coast, 2002)Jacobs, James, Erik Mona, and Ed Stark. Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss (Wizards of the Coast, 2006)Jacobs, James. \\"Demogorgon: Prince of Demons\\" Dragon #357 (Paizo Publishing, July 2007) He has also appeared in other Dungeons & Dragons products, such as in the novel Archmage by R.A. Salvatore and in the video game Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn. =NetHack= In the game NetHack, Demogorgon wields a combination of stunning, poisoning, disease, and damage attacks. He is infamously the most powerful monster in the game. However, he does not have a fixed place in the game, and is generally only seen when other major demons summon him (a small probability per turn). =Castle Clash= In the game Castle Clash, Demogorgon is a powerful boss that can be found in events and elite dungeons. In television =Stranger Things= Demogorgon is the name given to the otherworldly antagonist of the Netflix original show, Stranger Things, which began airing in 2016.People Magazine article: \\"The Stranger Things Cast Reveals What It's Really Like Working with a Demogorgon\\". This name is inspired by the Dungeons & Dragons creature.

Ghosts () is a play by the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. It was written in 1881 and first staged in 1882 in Chicago, Illinois, in a production by a Danish company on tour. Like many of Ibsen's plays, Ghosts is a scathing commentary on 19th-century morality. Because of its subject matter, which includes religion, venereal disease, incest, and euthanasia,Ibsen, Henrik, Ghosts. Four Major Plays. Oxford World‚Äôs Classic. Oxford University Press. (1981) it immediately generated strong controversy and negative criticism. Since then the play has fared better, and is considered a ‚Äúgreat play‚ÄùIbsen, Henrik. Four Great Plays. Bantam Books (1984) that historically holds a position of ‚Äúimmense importance‚Äù.Ibsen, Henrik. Ibsen. Plays: 1: Ghosts; The Wild Duck; The Master Builder. Dramatists Play Service Inc. (1980) . Page 24 Theater critic Maurice Valency wrote in 1963, \\"From the standpoint of modern tragedy Ghosts strikes off in a new direction.... Regular tragedy dealt mainly with the unhappy consequences of breaking the moral code. Ghosts, on the contrary, deals with the consequences of not breaking it.\\" Valency, Maurice. The Flower and the Castle: An Introduction to Modern Drama. Macmillan, 1963. pp. 160‚Äì162. Characters * Mrs. Helen Alving, a widow * Oswald Alving, her son, a painter * Pastor Manders, an old friend of Helen Alving * Jacob Engstrand, a carpenter * Regina Engstrand, Mrs. Alving's maid and the purported daughter of Jacob Engstrand, but she is actually the late Captain Alving's illegitimate child Plot Helen Alving is about to dedicate an orphanage she has built in memory of her late husband, Captain Alving. She reveals to Pastor Manders that her marriage was secretly miserable because her husband was unfaithful. She has built the orphanage to deplete her husband's wealth so that their son Oswald will not inherit anything from him. Pastor Manders once advised her to return to her husband despite his philandering, and she followed his advice in the hope that she could reform him. But her husband continued his affairs until his death, and Mrs. Alving stayed with him to protect her son from the taint of scandal and for fear of being shunned by the community. In the course of the play, she discovers that her son Oswald (whom she had sent away to avoid his being corrupted by his father) is suffering from syphilis that she believes he inherited from his father. She also discovers that Oswald has fallen in love with her maid Regina Engstrand, who is revealed to be the illegitimate daughter of Captain Alving and is therefore Oswald's half-sister. A sub-plot involves a carpenter, Jacob Engstrand, who married Regina's mother when she was already pregnant. He regards Regina as his own daughter. He is unaware, or pretends to be, that Captain Alving was Regina's father. Having recently completed his work building Mrs. Alving's orphanage, Engstrand announces his ambition to open a hostel for seafarers. He tries to persuade Regina to leave Mrs. Alving and help him run the hostel, but she refuses. The night before the orphanage is due to open, Engstrand asks Pastor Manders to hold a prayer- meeting there. Later that night, the orphanage burns down. Earlier, Manders had persuaded Mrs. Alving not to insure the orphanage, as to do so would imply a lack of faith in divine providence. Engstrand says the blaze was caused by Manders' carelessness with a candle and offers to take the blame, which Manders readily accepts. Manders in turn offers to support Engstrand's hostel. When Regina and Oswald's sibling relationship is exposed, Regina departs, leaving Oswald in anguish. He asks his mother to help him avoid the late stages of syphilis with a fatal morphine overdose. She agrees, but only if it becomes necessary. The play concludes with Mrs. Alving having to confront the decision of whether or not to euthanize her son in accordance with his wishes.Ibsen, Henrik, Ghosts. Four Major Plays. Oxford World‚Äôs Classic. Oxford University Press. (1981) Writing As with his other plays, Henrik Ibsen wrote Ghosts in Danish, the common written language of Denmark and Norway, at the time. The original title, in both Danish and Norwegian, is Gengangere, which can be literally translated as \\"again walkers\\", \\"ones who return\\", or \\"revenants\\".Watts, Peter. Notes, p. 291, in Henrik Ibsen, Ghosts and other Plays, Penguin Classics, 1964. It has a double meaning of both \\"ghosts\\" and \\"events that repeat themselves\\", so the English title Ghosts fails to capture this double meaning. Ibsen wrote Ghosts during the autumn of 1881 and published it in December of the same year. As early as November 1880, when he was living in Rome, Ibsen was meditating on a new play to follow A Doll's House. When he went to Sorrento, in the summer of 1881, he was hard at work upon it. He finished it by the end of November 1881 and published it in Copenhagen on 13 December. Its world stage premi√®re was on 20 May 1882 in Norwegian by a Danish company in Chicago, Illinois. Performance history Charlotta Raa-Winterhjelm as Mrs. Alving and August Lindberg as Osvald in the 1883 Swedish performance. Ghosts premiered in May 1882 in the United States, when a Danish touring company produced it in Chicago, Illinois, at the Aurora Turner Hall. Ibsen disliked the English translator William Archer's use of the word \\"Ghosts\\" as the play's title, as the Norwegian Gengangere would be more accurately translated as \\"The Revenants\\", which literally means \\"The Ones Who Return\\". The play was first performed in Sweden at Helsingborg on 22 August 1883. The play was produced independently in September 1889 at Berlin's Die Freie B√ºhne. The play achieved a single private London performance on 13 March 1891 at the Royalty Theatre. The issue of Lord Chamberlain's Office censorship, because of the subject matter of illegitimate children and sexually transmitted disease, was avoided by the formation of a subscription- only Independent Theatre Society to produce the play. Its members included playwright George Bernard Shaw and authors Thomas Hardy and Henry James.Theatreland Timeline (London Metropolitan Archives) accessed 11 October 2007 Ghosts was first produced in New York City on 5 January 1894. It was produced again in 1899 by the New York Independent Theatre with Mary Shaw as Mrs. Alving. Russian actress Alla Nazimova, with Paul Orleneff, gave a notable production of Ghosts in a small room on the Lower East Side. When Nazimova was a student in Russia, she wanted to ‚Äúplay Regina for my graduation piece at the dramatic school at Moscow, but they would not let me. Ghosts was at that time prohibited by the censor, because it reflects on the Church.‚Äù The play received many European performances. In its 1906 production in Berlin, the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch was commissioned to create the original stage designs. On 4 May 1962, the play was represented in M√©xico, in the Theatre Sala Chopin in Mexico City with Mexican actress and Hollywood star Dolores del R√≠o in the role of Mrs. Alving. A Broadway revival of Ghosts ran from 30 August to 2 October 1982 at the Brooks Atkinson Theater in New York City, and starred Kevin Spacey as Oswald in his Broadway debut. The cast included Edward Binns, John Neville (who also directed the production) as Pastor Manders, Liv Ullmann as Mrs. Alving, and Jane Murray as Regina. A touring UK production, designed by Simon Higlett and inspired by Edvard Munch's original stage designs for a 1906 staging in Berlin, began performances at Kingston's Rose Theatre in the United Kingdom on 19 September 2013, prior to an official opening on 25 September. Directed by Stephen Unwin, the cast included Patrick Drury as Pastor Manders, Florence Hall as Regina, Kelly Hunter as Mrs Alving, and Mark Quartley as Oswald. An award-winning 2013‚Äì14 London production opened at the Almeida Theatre on 26 September 2013 and transferred to the West End at Trafalgar Studios on 9 December, running through 22 March 2014.http://www.playbill.com/news/article/184459-Richard-Eyres-Production-of- Ibsens-Ghosts-to-Transfer-to-West-Ends-Trafalgar-Studios/I%3E-to-Transfer-to- West-Ends-Trafalgar-Studios Adapted and directed by Richard Eyre, it featured Lesley Manville, Jack Lowden, Will Keen, Charlene McKenna, and Brian McCardie.

In 2014 a Chinese-Norwegian co-production entitled Ghosts 2.0 was produced in Beijing, commissioned by Ibsen International and directed by Wang Chong, who started the Chinese New Wave Theater Movement. The multimedia performance used four cameras on the stage, giving the audience different perspectives.http://ibseninternational.com/productions/ghosts-2-0/http://artsreview.com.au/malthouse- theatre-announces-collaboration-with-wang-chong/ Original reception Ibsen's contemporaries found the play shocking and indecent, and disliked its more than frank treatment of the forbidden topic of venereal disease. At the time, the mere mention of venereal disease was scandalous, and to show that a person who followed society's ideals of morality was at risk from her own husband was considered beyond the pale. According to Richard Eyre, \\"There was an outcry of indignation against the attack on religion, the defence of free love, the mention of incest and syphilis. Large piles of unsold copies were returned to the publisher, the booksellers embarrassed by their presence on the shelves.\\" Upon being produced in England in 1891, the play was reviled in the press. In a typical review at the time, The Daily Telegraph referred to it as \\"Ibsen's positively abominable play entitled Ghosts.... An open drain: a loathsome sore unbandaged; a dirty act done publicly.... Gross, almost putrid indecorum.... Literary carrion.... Crapulous stuff\\". When Ghosts was produced in Norway it scandalised Norwegian society and Ibsen was strongly criticised. In 1898 when Ibsen was presented to King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway, at a dinner in Ibsen's honour, the King told Ibsen that Ghosts was not a good play. After a pause, Ibsen exploded, \\"Your Majesty, I had to write Ghosts!\\" Film and television Ghosts has been filmed, and adapted for film and television, numerous times in various languages. It was adapted at least three times for silent films. In 1915, George Nichols directed a film of the same name for producer D. W. Griffith. Mary Alden and Henry B. Walthall starred. Also in 1915, it was filmed in Russia, directed and adapted by Vladimir Gardin. In 1918, the Italian production company Milano Films released an adaptation titled ', starring Ermete Zacconi and his wife .. In 1987 it was televised on the BBC, directed by Elijah Moshinsky and featuring Judi Dench as Mrs. Alving, Kenneth Branagh as Oswald, Michael Gambon as Pastor Manders, and Natasha Richardson as Regina.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091111/ In 2014 Richard Eyre's award-winning London stage adaptation starring Lesley Manville and Jack Lowden was filmed and screened at numerous cinemas, and is available to view online.Ghosts Screening (clip).

Managing audience attention is the aim of all theater, and the foremost requirement of all magic acts. Whether the magic is of a \\"pocket trick\\" variety, or, a large stage production, misdirection is the central secret. The term describes either the effect (the observer's focus on an unimportant object) or the sleight of hand or patter (the magician's speech) that creates it. It is difficult to say who first coined the term, but an early reference to misdirection appears in the writing of an influential performer and writer, Nevil Maskelyne: \\"It consists admittedly in misleading the spectator's senses, in order to screen from detection certain details for which secrecy is required.\\"Our Magic, page 117, second edition copyright 1946 Around the same time, magician, artist and author Harlan Tarbell noted, \\"Nearly the whole art of sleight of hand depends on this art of misdirection.\\"Harlan Tarbell, The Tarbell Course in Magic Vol. 1 Henry Hay describes the central act of conjuring as \\"a manipulation of interest.\\"Henry Hay, The Amateur Magicians Handbook, pg. 2, copyright 1972 Magicians misdirect audience attention in two basic ways. One leads the audience to look away for a fleeting moment, so that they don't detect some sleight or move. The other approach re-frames the audience's perception, distracting them into thinking that an extraneous factor has much to do with the accomplishment of the feat when it really has no bearing on the effect at all. Dariel Fitzkee notes that \\"The true skill of the magician is in the skill he exhibits in influencing the spectators mind.\\"Dariel Fitzkee, Magic by Misdirection, pg. 33, copyright 1975 Additionally, sometimes a prop such as a \\"magic wand\\" aids in misdirection. Use In The Encyclopedia of Magic and Magicians, author T.A. Waters writes that \\"Misdirection is the cornerstone of nearly all successful magic; without it, even the most skilled Sleight of Hand or mechanical device is unlikely to create an illusion of real magic.\\"The Encyclopedia of Magic and Magicians, pg. 232, copyright 1988 Misdirection uses the limits of the human mind to give the wrong picture and memory. The mind of a typical audience member can only concentrate on one thing at a time. The magician uses this to manipulate the audience's ideas, or, perceptions of sensory input, leading them to false conclusions. The performer can direct the audience's attention in various ways. In the book, The Secret Art of Magic, authors Eric Evans and Nowlin Craver posit that magic is directly related to warfare, and relies on the same principles for success. They reference Sun Tzu's Art of War to show how deception is essential to any successful campaign. Craver goes on to illustrate, through the 36 strategies,The 36 Strategems how they form a blueprint for every known method of misdirection. In World War II, British military intelligence employed stage magician Jasper Maskelyne to help devise various forms of misdirection such as ruses, deception, and camouflage. Magicians who have researched and evolved misdirection techniques include Max Malini,wikipedia contributors. (2019, November 6). Max Malini. In wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.

The Magic of Slydini, Harry Stanly Publishing, London, 1968. and Dai Vernon. Definitions In his 1948 book, Principles and Deceptions, Arthur Buckley questions the accuracy of the term.(copyright 1948, page 27) Since that time, magicians have debated use of the term misdirection, creating a great deal of discussion about what it is and how it works. Buckley drew a distinction between misdirection and direction. One being a negative term, and the other positive. Ultimately, he equates the two as the same thing: \\"If a performer by some means has directed the thoughts of his audience to the conclusion that he has done something which he has not done, he has wrongly directed them into this belief, hence, misdirection.\\" Jacobus Maria Bemelman, under the stage name Tommy Wonder,The Books of Wonder Volume I, copyright 1996 has pointed out that it is much more effective, from the magician's point of view, to concentrate on the positive aim of directing the audience's attention. He writes that \\"Misdirection implies 'wrong' direction. It suggests that attention is directed away from something. By constantly using this term, it eventually becomes so ingrained in our minds that we might start to perceive misdirection as directing attention away from rather than toward something.\\" In his October-November 2019 United States \\"Slydini Inspiration\\" lecture tour, Tony Slydini protege' Bill Wisch combined two definitions of Tony Slydini's into one coherent one. Bill explained that when he asked Slydini \\"What is misdirection?\\", Slydini would repeat \\"if you believe it, they'll believe it\\" and \\"magic is something they don't see.\\" Bill's combined definition: \\"Misdirection is true when they believe what you do and then follow you.\\" See also *The Conjurer (painting) by Hieronymus Bosch (c. 1502) *Magic (illusion) *Optical illusion *Secrecy References External links *Misdirection Resource Center *Misdirection methods *A psychologically-based taxonomy of misdirection Category:Deception ","title":"Misdirection (magic)"},{"id":"555604","text":"Warren Steed Jeffs (born 3 December 1955) is the President of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church), a polygamous denomination. In 2011, he was convicted of two felony counts of child sexual assault, for which he is currently serving a life sentence plus twenty years.The FLDS Church was founded in the early-20th century when the founders deemed the renunciation of polygamy by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) to be apostate; there is no affiliation between the FLDS Church and the LDS Church: In 2006, Jeffs was placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List for his flight from the charges that he had arranged illegal marriages between his adult male followers and underage girls in Utah. In 2007, Arizona charged him with eight additional counts in two separate cases, including incest and sexual conduct with minors. In September 2007, Jeffs was convicted of two counts of rape as an accomplice, for which he was sentenced to imprisonment for ten years to life in Utah State Prison. This conviction was overturned by the Utah Supreme Court in 2010 due to flawed jury instructions. Jeffs was extradited to Texas, where he was found guilty of sexual assault of a child (for sex with a 15-year-old he had married) and aggravated sexual assault against a child (for sex with a 12-year-old he had married), for which he was sentenced to life in prison plus twenty years and fined $10,000. Family and early life Warren Steed Jeffs was born on 3 December 1955 to Rulon Jeffs (1909‚Äì2002) and Merilyn Steed (born circa 1935). Warren was born more than two months prematurely in Sacramento, California. Rulon Jeffs became the President of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church) in 1986, and at his death, was survived by nineteen or twenty wives and approximately 60 children Former church members claim that Warren himself has 87 wives. Warren grew up outside of Salt Lake City, Utah, and for more than twenty years served as the principal of Alta Academy, an FLDS private school at the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon. Jeffs became principal in 1976, the year he turned 21. He was known for being \\"a stickler for the rules and for discipline.\\" Church leadership Prior to his father's death in 2002, Jeffs held the position of counselor to the church leader. Jeffs became Rulon's successor with his official title in the FLDS Church becoming \\"President and Prophet, Seer and Revelator\\" as well as \\"President of the Priesthood\\". The latter concerned being head of the organization of all adult male church members that were deemed worthy to hold the priesthood, a tradition carried on in the Latter Day Saint movement. Following Rulon's death, Jeffs told the high-ranking FLDS officials, \\"I won't say much, but I will say this‚Äîhands off my father's wives.\\" When addressing his father's widows he said, \\"You women will live as if Father is still alive and in the next room.\\" Within a week he had married all but two of his father's wives; one refused to marry Jeffs and was subsequently prohibited from ever marrying again, while the other, Rebecca Wall, fled the FLDS compound. Naomi Jessop, one of the first of Rulon's former wives to marry Jeffs, subsequently became his favorite wife and confidant. As the sole individual in the FLDS Church with the authority to perform marriages, Jeffs was responsible for assigning wives to husbands. He also had the authority to discipline male church members by \\"reassigning their wives, children and homes to another man.\\" Until courts in Utah intervened, Jeffs controlled almost all of the land in Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah, which was part of a church trust called the United Effort Plan (UEP). The land has been estimated to be worth over $100 million. All UEP assets were put in the custody of the Utah court system pending further litigation. As the result of a November 2012 court decision, much of the UEP land is to be sold to those who live on it. In January 2004, Jeffs expelled a group of twenty men from the Short Creek Community, including the mayor, and reassigned their wives and children to other men in the community. Jeffs, like his predecessors, continued the standard FLDS and Mormon fundamentalist tenet that faithful men must follow what is known as the doctrine of plural marriage in order to attain exaltation in the afterlife. Jeffs specifically taught that a devoted church member is expected to have at least three wives in order to get into heaven, and the more wives a man has, the closer he is to heaven. =Changes in location, leadership= Before his 2006 arrest, Jeffs had last been seen on 1 January 2005, near Eldorado, Texas, at the dedication ceremony of the foundation of a large FLDS temple on the YFZ Ranch. The ranch came into the public eye on 7 April 2008 when Texas authorities conducted a raid and took legal custody of 416 children, in response to a 31 March phone call alleging physical and sexual abuse on the ranch. The caller claimed to be a 16-year-old girl married to a 50-year-old man who had, at age 15, given birth to his child. Residents, however, told authorities that there was in fact no such girl, and the calls were ultimately traced to 33-year-old Rozita Swinton, totally unconnected to the FLDS Church, and known for repeated instances of filing false reports. Nevertheless, Texas authorities continued to investigate whether Swinton's claims were a hoax. The women and children who were suspected of being minors were returned after Texas courts established that the state had not presented sufficient evidence of abuse to have removed them. On 10 June 2006, Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard told the Deseret News that he had heard from several sources that Jeffs had returned to Arizona, and had performed marriage ceremonies in a mobile home that was being used as a wedding chapel. On 27 March 2007, the Deseret News reported that Jeffs had renounced his role as prophet of the FLDS Church in a conversation with his brother Nephi. Nephi quoted him as saying he was \\"the greatest of all sinners\\" and that God never called him to be a prophet. Jeffs presented a handwritten note to the judge at the end of trial on 27 March saying that he was not a prophet of the FLDS Church. On 7 November, the Washington County, Utah, Attorney's Office released video of jailhouse conversations between Nephi and Jeffs, in which Jeffs renounces his prophethood, claiming that God had told him that if he revealed that he was not the rightful prophet, and was a \\"wicked man\\", he would still gain a place in the celestial kingdom. Jeffs also admits to what he calls \\"immoral actions with a sister and a daughter\\" when he was 20 years old. Other records show that while incarcerated, Jeffs tried to commit suicide by banging his head against the walls and trying to hang himself. Jeffs formally resigned as President of the FLDS Church effective 20 November 2007. In an email to the Deseret News, Jeffs' attorneys made the following statements: \\"Mr. Jeffs has asked that the following statement be released to the media and to members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints .... Mr. Jeffs resigned as President of the Corporation of the President of The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints Inc.\\" The statement did not address his ecclesiastical position as prophet of the FLDS Church, and many in the FLDS communities still regard him as the prophet and their current leader. There are also reports that Jeffs admitted his position of prophet in the FLDS Church was a usurpation in a conversation to his brother, and declared that \\"Brother William E. Jessop has been the prophet since [my] Father's passing\\", though Jeffs' attorneys have claimed he misspoke. In early 2011, Jeffs retook legal control of the denomination. Sex crimes allegations and FBI's Most Wanted In July 2004, Jeffs' nephew, Brent Jeffs, filed a lawsuit alleging that Jeffs had anally raped him in the FLDS Church's Salt Lake Valley compound in the late 1980s. Together with author Maia Szalavitz, Brent wrote the memoir Lost Boy, which recounts alleged incidents of child sexual abuse inflicted upon him by Jeffs, his brothers, and other family members, committed when Brent was aged 5 or 6. Brent's brother Clayne committed suicide after accusing Jeffs of sexually assaulting him as a child. Two of Jeffs' nephews, and two of Jeffs' own children, have also publicly claimed to have been sexually abused by him. In June 2005, Jeffs was charged in Mohave County, Arizona, with sexual assault on a minor and with conspiracy to commit sexual misconduct with a minor for allegedly arranging, in April 2001, a marriage between a then-14-year-old girl and her 19-year-old first cousin, Allen. The young girl, Elissa Wall (then known as \\"Jane Doe IV\\", and the younger sister of Rebecca Wall), testified that she begged Rulon Jeffs to let her wait until she was older or choose another man for her. The elder Jeffs was apparently \\"sympathetic\\", but his son was not, and she was forced to go through with the marriage. Wall alleged that Allen often raped her and that she repeatedly miscarried. She eventually left Allen and the community. In July 2005, the Arizona Attorney General's office distributed wanted posters offering $10,000 for information leading to Jeffs' arrest and conviction. On 28 October, Jeffs' brother Seth was arrested under suspicion of harboring a fugitive. During a routine traffic stop in Pueblo County, Colorado, police found nearly $142,000 in cash, $7,000 worth of prepaid debit cards and personal records. During Seth's court case, FBI Agent Andrew Stearns testified that Seth had told him that he did not know where his older brother was and that he would not reveal his whereabouts if he did. Seth was convicted of harboring a fugitive on 1 May 2006. On 14 July, he was sentenced to three years' probation and a $2,500 fine. On 5 April 2006, Utah issued an arrest warrant for Jeffs on felony charges of accomplice rape of a teenage girl between 14 and 18 years old. Shortly after, on 6 May, the FBI placed Jeffs on its Top Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, offering a $60,000 reward. He was the 482nd fugitive listed on the list. The reward was soon raised to $100,000, and the public was warned that \\"Jeffs may travel with a number of loyal and armed bodyguards\\". On 8 June 2006, Jeffs returned to Colorado City to perform more \\"child-bride marriages.\\" On 27 May 2008, The Smoking Gun website released images of Jeffs with two underage wives, one of whom was 12 years old, celebrating one-year anniversaries in 2005 and 2006. =Arrest, trial and conviction= On 28 August 2006, around 9 p.m. PDT, Jeffs was pulled over on Interstate 15 in Clark County, Nevada, by highway trooper Eddie Dutchover because the temporary license plates on his red 2007 Cadillac Escalade were not visible. One of Jeffs' wives, Naomi Jessop, and his brother, Isaac, were with him. Jeffs possessed four computers, sixteen cell phones, disguises (including three wigs and twelve pairs of sunglasses), and more than $55,000 in cash. Jeffs' wife and brother were questioned and released. In a Nevada court hearing on 31 August, Jeffs waived extradition and agreed to return to Utah to face two first-degree felony charges of accomplice rape. Each charge carries an indeterminate penalty of five years to life in prison. Arizona prosecutors were next in line to try Jeffs. He was held in the Washington County jail, pending an 23 April 2007 trial on two counts of rape, as an accomplice for his role in arranging the marriage between Elissa Wall and her first cousin. Jeffs was believed to be leading his group from jail, and a Utah state board has expressed dissatisfaction in dealing with Hildale police, believing that many members of the force had ties to Jeffs, so therefore did not cooperate. In May and July 2007, Jeffs was indicted in Arizona on eight counts, including sexual conduct with a minor and incest. Jeffs' trial began on 11 September 2007 in St. George, Utah, with Judge James L. Shumate presiding. Jeffs was housed in Utah's Purgatory Correctional Facility in solitary confinement for the duration. At the culmination of the trial, on 25 September, Jeffs was found guilty of two counts of being an accomplice to rape. He was sentenced to prison for ten years to life and began serving his sentence at the Utah State Prison. On 27 July 2010, the Utah Supreme Court, citing deficient jury instructions, reversed Jeffs' convictions and ordered a new trial. The court found that the trial judge should have told the jury that Jeffs could not be convicted unless he intended for Elissa's husband to engage in nonconsensual sex with her. Elissa subsequently wrote an autobiography on her experiences in the FLDS Church and with Jeffs entitled Stolen Innocence. The book was co-authored with former New York Times journalist Lisa Pulitzer. Jeffs was also scheduled to be tried in Arizona. He had entered a not-guilty plea on 27 February 2008, to sex charges stemming from the arranged marriages of three teenage girls to older men. He was transported to the Mohave County jail to await trial. On 9 June 2010, a state judge, at the request of Mohave County prosecutor Matt Smith, dismissed all charges with prejudice. Smith said that the Arizona victims no longer wanted to testify, and that Jeffs had spent almost two years in jail awaiting trial ‚Äî more than he would have received had he been convicted. Combined with the pending charges against Jeffs in Texas, Smith concluded that \\"it would be impractical and unnecessary\\" to try Jeffs in Arizona. Jeffs was then returned to Utah; at the time, his appeal of the 2007 conviction was still pending. On 9 August 2011, Jeffs was convicted on two counts of sexual assault of a child and sentenced to life in prison. Warren Jeffs, Texas Department of Criminal Justice #01726705, will be eligible for parole on 22 July 2038. Prison life Jeffs tried to hang himself in jail in 2007 in Utah. On 9 July 2008, he was taken from the Mohave County, Arizona jail in Kingman, Arizona to a Las Vegas, Nevada hospital for what was described as a serious medical problem. Sheriff Tom Sheahan did not specify Jeffs' medical problem but said it was serious enough to move him about 100 miles from the Kingman Regional Medical Center to the Nevada hospital. Jeffs has engaged in lengthy hunger strikes, which his doctors and attorneys have claimed were for spiritual reasons. In August 2009, Superior Court Judge Steve Conn ordered that Jeffs be force fed, at the Arizona jail. On 29 August 2011, Jeffs was taken to East Texas Medical Center, Tyler, Texas, and hospitalized in critical condition under a medically induced coma after excessive fasting. Officials were not sure how long he would remain hospitalized, but expected Jeffs to live. Jeffs is incarcerated at the Louis C. Powledge Unit of the TDCJ near Palestine, Texas. Jeffs allegedly suffered a mental breakdown in the summer of 2019, leaving him unfit to give a deposition in a sex abuse case against him. Forcing him to testify would be ‚Äúfutile,‚Äù alleged attorneys representing the UEP community trust formerly belonging to the FLDS. In 2017, both the trust and Jeffs were sued by a woman alleging she was sexually abused by Jeffs when she was a child. \\"The trust has received reports that Warren Jeffs has suffered a mental breakdown, and there seems to be a high likelihood that Warren Jeffs is not mentally competent to provide admissible testimony,\\" its attorney wrote in an 8 July filing. The plaintiff's attorney said there is a lack of evidence to support a claim of Jeff's incompetency, accusing the trust of being \\"understandably very fearful\\" about Jeffs' testimony since it is liable for his actions as the past president of the FLDS. In 2005, Utah took over the trust. The court oversaw it for more than a decade before a judge handed it over to a board of community members composed mostly of former sect members. Current FLDS members continue to consider Jeffs to be their leader, their prophet who speaks to God and has been wrongly convicted.Lawyer: Polygamist leader Warren Jeffs has mental breakdown, Jackson Hole News and Guide, Bracy McCombs (AP), 13 August 2019. Retrieved 14 August 2019. In December 2012, Jeffs predicted that the world would end before 2013 and called for his followers to prepare for the end. =Jesus Christ Message to All Nations= While incarcerated at the Powledge Unit, Jeffs released a book entitled, Jesus Christ Message to All Nations, including several directives to set Jeffs free. Views =Statements on black people = In 2005, Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Report published the following statements made by Jeffs: * \\"The black race is the people through which the devil has always been able to bring evil unto the earth.\\" * Cain was \\"cursed with a black skin and he is the father of the Negro people. He has great power, can appear and disappear. He is used by the devil, as a mortal man, to do great evils.\\" * \\"Today you can see a black man with a white woman, et cetera.

She wrote the plot outlines for many books in the Nancy Drew series, using characters invented by her father, Edward Stratemeyer. Adams also oversaw other ghostwriters who wrote for these and many other series as a part of the Stratemeyer Syndicate, and rewrote many of the novels to update them starting in the late 1950s. Stratemeyer Syndicate With her sister, Edna, Adams took over control of the Stratemeyer Syndicate after her father Edward Stratemeyer's death in 1930. Edna ran the daily business operations, while Adams dealt with publishers and wrote; Edna became inactive when she married in 1942, and Adams took over the business. Adams is credited with keeping the Syndicate afloat through the Great Depression, and with revising the two most popular series, Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys, in the 1950s and 1960s, removing stereotypes and streamlining plots and characters. She ran the Syndicate for 52 years. Role in Nancy Drew series The extremely popular Nancy Drew books were the brainchild of Adams's father, who created the characters of a sixteen-year-old sleuth, her lawyer father, and their housekeeper. Later, Nancy's age was increased to eighteen to give her more independence. Adams came up with plot ideas and hired ghostwriters to flesh them out. The best-known books were written primarily by Mildred Wirt Benson, all published under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene. Adams outlined a few in the Hardy Boys series, which were published under the pseudonym Franklin W. Dixon. Although Adams claimed to write all the Nancy Drew books entirely by herself during her lifetime, it is well established that Wirt and 28 other authors did the actual writing, following Adams's ideas and embellishing on them. Adams touched up the completed manuscripts.Benfer, Amy. \\"Who was Carolyn Keene?\\". Salon. Retrieved 2016-04-14.

Life Bell was born in Edinburgh in 1726, his father a baker. He had little formal education and was apprenticed to the engraver Richard Cooper. Bell was a colourful Scot. His height was 4 foot 6; he had crooked legs and an enormous nose that he would sometimes augment with a paper-mache version whenever anyone stared at his natural nose. Bell began work as an engraver of crests, names, etc. on dog collars. Despite his small stature, he deliberately rode the tallest horse available in Edinburgh, dismounting by a ladder to the cheers of onlookers. He married Anne Wake who was the daughter of an excise officer in 1756. She was apparently the grand-daughter of the artist Andrew Crosbie and through this connection Bell inherited many of Crosbie's paintings.Cassell's Old and New Edinburgh vol. II p.223 Bell produced almost all of the copperplate engravings for the 1st-4th editions of the Britannica: 160 for the 1st, 340 for the 2nd, 542 for the 3rd, and 531 for the 4th. By contrast, the 50 plates of the Supplement to the 3rd edition were engraved by D. Lizars. After Macfarquhar died in 1793, Bell bought out his heirs and became sole owner of the Britannica until his own death in 1809. He quarrelled with his son-in-law, Thomson Bonar, and refused to speak with him for the last ten years of his life.

XVI: G1, I, mm. 29-53 .Benward & Saker (2009), Music in Theory and Practice: Volume II, p.138-39. Eighth Edition. . In classical music, musical development is a process by which a musical idea is communicated in the course of a composition. It refers to the transformation and restatement of initial material. Development is often contrasted with musical variation, which is a slightly different means to the same end. Development is carried out upon portions of material treated in many different presentations and combinations at a time, while variation depends upon one type of presentation at a time.Wennerstrom, Mary (1975). \\"Form in Twentieth- Century Music\\" (chap. 1), Aspects of Twentieth-Century Music. Wittlich, Gary (ed.). Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall. . In this process, certain central ideas are repeated in different contexts or in altered form so that the mind of the listener consciously or unconsciously compares the various incarnations of these ideas. Listeners may apprehend a \\"tension between expected and real results\\" (see irony), which is one \\"element of surprise\\" in music. This practice has its roots in counterpoint, where a theme or subject might create an impression of a pleasing or affective sort, but delight the mind further as its contrapuntal capabilities are gradually unveiled. In sonata form, the middle section (between the exposition and the recapitulation) is called the development. Typically, in this section, material from the exposition section is developed. In some older texts, this section may be referred to as free fantasia. According to the Oxford Companion to MusicTemperley, N. (2002, p. 355) ‚ÄúDevelopment‚Äù in Oxford Companion to Music. Oxford University Press. there are several ways of developing a theme. These include: * The division of a theme into parts, each of which can be developed in any of the above ways or recombined in a new way. Similarly, two or more themes can be developed in combination; in some cases, themes are composed with this possibility in mind. * Alteration of pitch intervals while retaining the original rhythm. * Rhythmic displacement, so that the metrical stress occurs at a different point in the otherwise unchanged theme. * Sequence, either diatonically within a key or through a succession of keys. The Scherzo movement from Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 15 in D major, Op 28 (the \\"Pastoral\\" Sonata) shows a number of these processes at work on a small scale. Charles Rosen (2002) marvels at the simplicity of the musical material: \\"The opening theme consists of nothing but four F sharps in descending octaves, followed by a light and simple I/ii/V7/I cadence with a quirky motif repeated four times.\\"Rosen, C. (2002, p.161), Beethoven's Piano Sonatas, a Short Companion. Yale University Press. These opening eight bars provide all the material Beethoven needs to furnish his development, which takes place in bars 33-48:Beethoven Piano Sonata Op 28, Scherzo Beethoven Pastoral Sonata Op. 28 Scherzo.  The division of a theme into parts  The falling octave in the first two bars and the repeated staccato chord in the left hand in bars 5-8 are the two fragments that Beethoven later develops:Beethoven Scherzo from Piano Sonata 15, thematic fragments used later in the development  Alteration of pitch intervals  The somewhat bald falling octave idea in the first four bars is transformed in bars 33-36 into an elegant shape ending with an upward-curving semitone:Transformation of opening idea  Rhythmic displacement  In this movement, the repeated left hand chords in bar 5 are displaced so that in bar 33 onwards, they fall on the 2nd and 3rd beats:Rhythmic displacement  Sequence and the development of two or more themes in combination  In bars 33-48, the two fragments combine and the development goes through a modulating sequence that touches on a succession of keys; Beethoven Piano Sonata Op 28, Scherzo, development sectionBeethoven, Scherzo from Sonata No 15, development section.

It is a verse tragedy, written in 1865 and first performed in Stockholm, Sweden on 24 March 1867. Brand is a priest who accepts the consequence of his choices, and is deeply bound to doing the \\"right thing\\". He believes primarily in the will of man, and lives by the belief \\"all or nothing\\". To make compromises is therefore difficult, or questionable. Brand's beliefs render him lonely, because those around him, when put to the test, generally cannot or will not follow his example. He is a young idealist whose main purpose is to save the world, or at least people's souls, but his judgment of others are harsh and unfair. The word brand means \\"fire\\" in Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Dutch and German. Plot Arne Aas (Brand) and Inger Marie Andersen (Agnes) in a 1968 production of Brand at Den Nationale Scene in Bergen =First act= At the beginning of the play, we find Brand in the mountains confronting different kinds of people: a farmer traveling with his son, who does not dare to brave a dangerous glacier on behalf of his dying daughter; Einar, a young painter with an easy-going attitude, and his fianc√©e, Agnes; and finally, a fifteen-year- old girl, Gerd, who claims to know of a bigger church in the mountains and hunts for a great hawk. Einar and Brand were in school together, and their conversation ends in a long discussion about God. Brand taunts Einar for portraying God as an old man, who \\"sees through his fingers\\", and wants to envision God as a young, heroic saviour. He believes that people have become too sloppy about their sins and shortcomings, because of the dogma that Christ, through his sacrifice, cleansed humanity once and for all. Brand vows to confront the three mindsets he has just met: the lazy mind (the farmer), the undisciplined mind (Einar), and the wild mind (Gerd). He ponders humanity's purpose and the difference between what is, and what should be. Here, we find the famous sentence: What you are, be fully, not in parts and pieces. =Second act= Brand enters the valley in which he was born, and finds great famine and need. The local bailiff distributes bread for the hungry in strict rations, and Brand questions the need for it. Meanwhile, a mother comes from the other side of the fjord, telling of her husband who needs absolution, because he, in dire need, killed one of his children rather than seeing him starve. Then he harmed himself. Nobody dares to venture the rough fjord, but Brand goes in a boat and, to his surprise, Agnes follows him. Gerd eggs him on, screaming from the hills above. Together, Brand and Agnes sail across the fjord, and the man gets his absolution. Brand muses over the remaining children, and what this experience might do to them, when a couple of farmers show up and demand that he stay with them as their priest. Brand is reluctant to do this, but they use his own words against him, and he gives in. Agnes, sitting on the beach, reflects and tells of an \\"inner world being born\\" in one of Ibsen's best known soliloquies. She renounces her former fianc√© Einar and chooses Brand. In the end of the second act, we meet Brand's mother, and learn that he grew up under the glacier, in a dreary place with no sun. His mother robbed his father while he was on his deathbed, and as a consequence, Brand does not want her money, but she urges him to take it. =Third act= Some years later, Brand and Agnes live together with their son, Alf, who is grievously ill because of the climate. The local doctor urges him to leave for the sake of his son, and he hesitates. Meanwhile, Brand's mother is dying, and Brand impresses on her that she will not get her priest unless she gives all her money to charity. She refuses to do so, and so Brand refuses to go to her. On the question of his son's health, the doctor points out that it is right to be \\"humane\\", whereas Brand answers: \\"Was God humane towards his son?\\" He states that by modern standards, the sacrifice of Christ would have boiled down to a \\"diplomatic heavenly charter\\", and no more. He clearly means that there is a difference between being a \\"human\\", and being a \\"humanist\\". In the end he almost gives in, but the farmers come to him and plead with him to stay. Then Gerd shows up, and states that evil forces will prevail if he leaves. The final straw is when she points out that the son is his \\"false god\\". Then he gives in and stays, knowing this will take his son's life. It is clear, however, that he wants Agnes to choose for him, and she answers: \\"Go the road your God appointed for you\\". =Fourth act= After the death of his son, Brand schemes to build a bigger church in the parish. The old one is too small to encompass his visions. He has hardened somewhat, and refuses to mourn. Agnes comforts herself with the clothes of her dead child, Alf. The local bailiff, who visits Brand in his home, is mostly opposed to Brand, but tells him that he has growing support in the parish and explains his own plans for building public institutions like a poorhouse, a jail and a political hall. The bailiff reveals that Brand's mother was forced to break with her true love, and married an old miser instead. The boy she loved then became involved with a Roma woman, resulting in the birth of Gerd. Brand is the result of the other, clearly loveless affair, and the bailiff suggests that there is some kind of spiritual sibling relationship between Brand and Gerd. After the bailiff leaves, a Roma woman arrives, demanding clothes for her freezing child (it is Christmas Eve). Brand then puts Agnes to the test, and gradually, she gives all of Alf's clothes to the Roma woman. As a result of this, Agnes renounces her life, and exclaims \\"I'm free\\". Brand accepts with effort, and Agnes dies. =Fifth act= Brand gets his new church built (in the 1860s, many old Norwegian churches were being rebuilt as new, larger places of worship). Brand comes to believe that his new church is still too small, and rebels against the authorities, the local dean and the bailiff. The provost talks about getting people to heaven \\"by the parish\\", and denounces individual thinking. The provost's speech should be examined in detail, also because he has a vision of the masses \\"marching with equal steps\\" towards salvation, and stressing that egality matters more to the church than freedom. This speech has been interpreted as holding a fascist undertone. In fact, the provost mentions that the ideal of a religious leader is \\"a corporal\\" that shall hold the masses in line. Rendered in Norwegian, the word \\"f√∏rer-ideal\\" is used in this passage (rhyming on corporal), something that to Norwegian (and German) ears easily could be interpreted as a foreshadowing of Hitler (f√∏rer = f√ºhrer). Brand's answers to this are mostly sarcastic. The provost ends his speech mentioning the \\"erasing of God in the soul of man\\", something of which he seems to approve. Brand, of course, wants the opposite: individual freedom and a clear picture of God in man's soul. Einar returns as a gloomy missionary soon after the provost's friendly speech. He has worked out a view of life that makes Brand shiver. Whereas Brand mourns the loss of his wife, Einar in the end thinks her death was righteous, because he regards her as a female seducer. Upon learning this, Brand shoves him off. In the end, Brand protests the heavy plight lain upon him by his elders, and throws the key to the church into the fjord and makes for the mountain with the entire parish following him. He makes a speech, and urges the people to \\"lift their faith\\", to make their Christianity surge through their entire existence, and in a way make a \\"Church without limits\\" that is meant to embrace all sides of life. In the end, he states that they all shall be priests in the task of relieving all people in the country from mental thralldom. The other clergymen protest against this because they no longer have any sway over their flock. Brand is greatly loved and respected by the common people, but the test is in the end too hard. They are lured down to the valley again by the bailiff, who fakes news of great economic opportunity (a large amount of fish in the sea). The same people who followed Brand, then chase him with stones in their hands. Brand is then left alone, struggling with doubt, remorse, and temptation, \\"the spirit of compromise\\". He does not yield to it, even when the spirit claims to be Agnes, something Brand doubts. The spirit says that the fall of man forever closed the gates to Paradise, but Brand states that the road of longing is still open. Then the spirit flees and says: \\"Die! The world does not need you!\\". Brand meets Gerd again, who thinks she sees the saviour in him, and Brand denies this. At the very end of the play, Gerd takes him to the glacier, her personal church, and Brand recoils when understanding where he is, the \\"Ice-cathedral\\". He breaks down in tears. Gerd, who has been hunting the hawk from the start of the play, fires a shot at it, and lets loose a great avalanche, which in the end buries the entire valley. In his dying words at the end of the play, Brand screams out to God, asking, \\"Does not salvation consider the will of man?\\" The final words are from an unknown voice: \\"He is the god of caritas.\\" What this line means has been debated. One interpretation is that Brand left love out of his worldview. Another might be that, being the god of love, God does not forget Brand after all. Analysis =Topics= The play debates freedom of will and the consequential choice. The problem is further debated in Peer Gynt. A crucial point is the discussion about the absence of love, and the sacrifice of Christ. As a consequence, the imitation of Christ can be regarded as a theme of the play (cf. Thomas √† Kempis). A key to this interpretation is found in the name of Agnes, clearly derived from Agnus Dei, the lamb of God or the sacrificial lamb. One should be aware that Brand never asks anyone to sacrifice themselves for his cause. He rather warns them off, if they wish to pledge themselves to him - as is the case of Agnes. But when she chooses, Brand reminds her of the moral consequence of that choice - it is final, and there is no turning back. Agnes chooses anyway, both the sweet and the bitter. One can also see a discussion in the play about what the Christian message really means, and what God's purpose with humankind really is. At one point Brand says: \\"The goal is to become blackboards for God to write upon\\". A reminiscence of this is found in Peer Gynt: \\"I was a paper, and was never written upon\\". The topics of the two plays are clearly related. Brand was Ibsen's breakthrough as playwright and author. Ibsen was himself fond of the play's main character, and claimed that Brand was \\"himself in his best moments\\". =Brand's vision= Brand's vision is arguably a romantic one, and his address in the fifth act resembles in a way Henrik Wergeland\`s vision in his great poem Man. His rebellion against the clergy, whom he feels are leading people astray rather than in the right direction, is also foreshadowed by Wergeland. He states here that \\"the spirit of compromise\\", a mentality he struggles to get free from all the way, is none other than Satan. When he is tempted later, we should be aware of this. From the beginning, Brand wishes to make man whole, because he is aware that there has been a split, a sundering somewhere in the past, and he wishes to fight a fragmented view of man and God. This fragmentation makes man weak, he states, and an easy prey to temptation - a result of the fall of man. The definition of wholeness as a greater good and fragmentarism as a bad thing, is a philosophical statement, originally derived from Plato and Pythagoras. The sentence about a Christianity that embraces all sides of life, resembles the view of the Danish priest Grundtvig. Throughout the play, we see that Brand looks for the right way to solve this problem, and makes new discoveries as he moves forward. One can also interpret the entire play as a tale of a developing soul, struggling with his connection to God. In this view, the collapse at the very end is a collapse of Brand's conflicting self, and the disaster opens a closed road for him. Thus, the final words of Gerd makes sense, as she finally manages to shoot the great hawk, with the words: \\"Salvation comes\\". This interpretation makes Gerd a restless voice in Brand's soul. The play can also be seen as a discussion of romanticism and reality, in a quite disillusional way. Ibsen at this stage leaves romanticism well behind, and moves on to greater realism. Some also consider Brand's character to have been based on the philosopher S√∏ren Kierkegaard.See Max Nordau Degeneration trans from the German London Heinnemann 1895 p 357 Kierkegaard gave an essential place in his philosophy to the opposition between faith and reason, the importance of making decisive choices and suffering in the name of God, and whose life ended during an official attack he led against the church of his country (which he thought perverted the original Christian message, making it an empty religion).

Filmed in Panavision, it was directed by Hal Needham, produced by Hong Kong's Golden Harvest films, and distributed by 20th Century Fox. It features an all-star supporting cast, including Burt Reynolds, Roger Moore, Dom DeLuise, Farrah Fawcett, and Jackie Chan. The film is based on the 1979 running of an actual cross-country outlaw road race in the United States, beginning in Connecticut and ending in California. It was one of 1981's most successful films at the box office. It was followed by Cannonball Run II (1984), and Speed Zone (1989). This and the 1984 sequel were the final film appearances of actor Dean Martin. It also featured Jackie Chan in his second Hollywood role. This plot is also used in the 2011 video game Need for Speed: The Run where Jack Rourke competes in the race for a $25,000,000 prize. Plot Race teams have gathered in Connecticut to start a cross-country car race. One at a time, teams drive up to the starters' stand, punch a time card to indicate their time of departure, then take off. Among the teams: :*JJ McClure (Reynolds) and Victor Prinzi (DeLuise), drive a souped-up, but otherwise authentic, Dodge Tradesman ambulance. (Hal Needham and Brock Yates used the same vehicle in the actual 1979 race.) :*Former open-wheel icon (and Scotch-swilling) Jamie Blake (Dean Martin) and his (gambling-obsessed) teammate Morris Fenderbaum (Sammy Davis Jr.), dressed as Catholic priests, drive a red Ferrari 308 GTS 1979. (They are based on an entry in the real 1972 race, in which three men disguised as priests (\\"The Flying Fathers\\") drove a Mercedes 280 SEL sedan, which they claimed to be \\"the Monsignor's car\\" belonging to an ecumenical council of prelates in California.) :*Jill Rivers (Tara Buckman) and Marcie Thatcher (Adrienne Barbeau), two attractive women who use their looks to their advantage, start the race in a black Lamborghini Countach. :*Jackie Chan and Michael Hui race in a high-tech, computer-laden Subaru GL 4WD hatchback with a rocket booster engine. :*A pair of good ol' boys, played by Terry Bradshaw and Mel Tillis, drive a street-legal replica of Donnie Allison's Hawaiian Tropic- sponsored NASCAR Winston Cup Series Chevrolet stock car owned by Hoss Ellington. (It starts off as '75‚Äì76 Laguna. After they paint it, it somehow becomes a '76‚Äì77 Monte Carlo.) :*Roger Moore plays Seymour Goldfarb, Jr., \\"heir to the Goldfarb Girdles fortune\\", who perpetually identifies himself as actor Roger Moore and signs into the race under that name. His character behaves similarly to James Bond and only once (by his mother) is called by his real name. He drives a silver Aston Martin DB5. (This film was released around the same time as Moore's next bona fide James Bond film, For Your Eyes Only.) :*Jamie Farr portrays an oil-rich Middle-Eastern sheikh, driving a white Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow. At the starting line, observing from the shadows, is Mr. Arthur J. Foyt (a play on the name of racer A. J. Foyt), a representative of the \\"Safety Enforcement Unit\\", who tries to stop the race because of its environmental effects and safety issues. In the car with Foyt (George Furth) is a photographer and tree lover, Pamela Glover (Fawcett). Beyond the starting line, JJ and Victor (driving their ambulance) come across Foyt and Glover, who have been involved in a minor fender-bender. Glover implores JJ and Victor to help, but when they tell Foyt to enter the ambulance through the back door, they kidnap Glover and take off without Foyt. As the race progresses, Victor occasionally turns into his alter ego, superhero \\"Captain Chaos\\". The very spooky Dr. Van Helsing (Jack Elam) and his huge hypodermic needle are also in the ambulance to \\"help\\" keep Glover quiet during the race. Various teams are shown either evading law enforcement, most of which deal with talking their way out of a possible ticket, or concocting crazy schemes to outmaneuver their opponents. :*Jill and Marcie use sex appeal as their weapon, unzipping their race suits to display copious amounts of cleavage during traffic stops. (However, this fails to work on a busty female traffic officer played in a cameo appearance by actress Valerie Perrine.) :*In New Jersey, the ambulance is pulled over by state troopers; Dr. Van Helsing drugs Glover, and JJ and Victor are able to convince the troopers that they're rushing \\"the Senator's wife\\" to UCLA for medical treatment (offering the theory, which to JJ and Victor's happy surprise is Van Helsing's idea, that her condition prevents them from flying, or from even driving through Denver). :*The Subaru team is able to turn off their car's headlights and use infrared sensors for racing at night. :*Seymour Goldfarb is frequently shown evading police by using various James Bond-type gadgets, such as oil slicks, smoke screens, switchable license plates, all installed in his Aston Martin DB5. :*Mr. Compton (Bert Convy) and \\"Super Chief\\" Finch (Warren Berlinger) disguise themselves as a newlywed couple on a motorcycle, but Finch's extra weight forces the two to ride cross-country in a continuous wheelie. The primary rivalry is between the ambulance and the Ferrari. In Ohio, Fenderbaum and Blake are able to convince Victor to pull over the ambulance in order to bless the patient on board. While Blake carries out the blessing, Fenderbaum flattens one of the ambulance's rear tires. JJ gets his revenge in Missouri by convincing a nearby police officer that the two men dressed as priests are actually Communists and sex perverts who are responsible for the flashing victim in the ambulance. The leading teams find themselves stopped on a desert highway, waiting for construction workers to clear the road. A biker gang (led by Peter Fonda) shows up and begins harassing Compton and Finch. It quickly gets out of hand and a free-for-all fistfight ensues. \\"Captain Chaos\\" re- emerges to fight the bikers. The Subaru team also joins in (Naturally, Jackie Chan puts his martial arts skills to work) and fists and kicks fly. The construction crew announces that the road is open, so the teams sprint back to their cars to resume the race. The ambulance falls behind the pack until Victor once again becomes Captain Chaos. The vehicles all arrive at the final destination at the same time, so it is a foot race to the finish line. JJ hands his team's time card to Victor, then ambushes the remaining racers, leaving only Victor and one of the Lamborghini women, Marcie. Just when it appears Victor will reach the time clock first, a spectator shouts that her \\"baby\\" has fallen into the water. Victor, still in his Captain Chaos persona, rushes to save the baby (later revealed to be her dog), allowing Marcie to clock in first and win the race. JJ is furious and never wants to see Captain Chaos again, but Victor replies that he does not care, becoming the persona he really wants to be, Captain USA. JJ laughs and hugs him. Foyt reappears and blames everyone for ruining the American highway. Seymour offers a cigar and tells Foyt to use the lighter in his car, which activates an ejection seat when pushed. Nothing happens at first, but when Seymour presses the button, he (Seymour) goes flying into the water. Cast Cannonball Run featured an all- star ensemble cast, including these actors: * Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise as racer J.J. McClure and his buddy, mechanic Victor Prinzi, a.k.a. \\"Captain Chaos.\\" * Roger Moore as Seymour Goldfarb, Jr., a self-parody of his role as James Bond. His car, an Aston Martin DB5, displays the UK registration plate 6633 PP, same as the one in the Bond films Goldfinger and Thunderball., although Moore's Bond never actually drove an Aston Martin in any of his seven Bond appearances. (The original UK registration plate was BMT 216A before being sold to businessman Gavin Keyzar.) Molly Picon portrays his mother. Several women ride with Seymour, including model Lois Hamilton, billed as Lois Areno. * Farrah Fawcett as tree-loving photographer Pamela Glover. J.J. calls her \\"Beauty.\\" * Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. as race car driver Jamie Blake and scam artist Morris Fenderbaum, disguised as Catholic priests. Jimmy \\"The Greek\\" Snyder plays himself as Fenderbaum bets on his success. (Snyder was Dean Martin's neighbor when both were growing up in Steubenville, Ohio.) Blake's car, a Ferrari 308 GTS 1979, is the same as the model in the TV series TV Magnum, P.I.. * George Furth as Arthur J. Foyt, the insipid, uptight main antagonist of the film, who tries to have the race stopped. * Jackie Chan and Michael Hui as drivers of a Subaru GL filled with gadgets. In the opening part of the film, Chan and Hui are introduced on a talk show (hosted by Johnny Yune) as the operators of Japan's entry into the race. (Both Chan and Hui were actually Chinese; furthermore, the credits mistakenly credit the two as \\"Mitsubishi Driver(s).\\")\\"Blu-ray Review: The Cannonball Run.\\" moviegazetteonline.com * Jamie Farr as Sheik Abdul ben Falafel, a wealthy Arabian potentate determined to win the race, even if he has to buy it. Bianca Jagger makes a brief appearance as his sister. Farr's car is a Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow. The Sheik is the only character to appear in all three Cannonball Run films. * Mel Tillis and Terry Bradshaw are Mel and Terry, a couple of \\"good ol' boys\\" driving a thinly-disguised Chevrolet Malibu NASCAR Grand National race car, resembling the Hoss Ellington No. 1 Hawaiian Tropic car Donnie Allison drove in 1979, most famously in the 1979 Daytona 500 crash that led to the famous fight. * Adrienne Barbeau and Tara Buckman as Marcie Thatcher and Jill Rivers, satin-Spandex-clad \\"hotties\\" in a black Lamborghini Countach. The same Lamborghini was used in the film's opening credits as it was being pursued by a Nevada Highway Patrol car. Valerie Perrine has an uncredited cameo as a state trooper. (Their character names are not mentioned during the story, but appear in the end credits. Their names return in the sequel, though the parts were re-cast.) * Peter Fonda has a cameo role referencing his character in The Wild Angels. The appearance of Fonda and his motorcycle gang during a halt in the race offered an excuse for Chan to demonstrate his martial arts skills during the fight sequence. Fonda's big, bald biker buddy is played by Robert Tessier. * Bert Convy as wealthy but bored executive Bradford Compton, who planned to run the Cannonball by motorcycle with the help of an old friend, Shakey Finch (Warren Berlinger), once the world's greatest cross-country motorcyclist. The two planned to disguise themselves as newlyweds. Compton's now portly ally forced them into a wheelie for the entire race. * Jack Elam as Doctor Nikolas Van Helsing, same name as the famous vampire hunter. This Van Helsing is a proctologist and graduate of the University of Rangoon, and the Knoxville, Tennessee College of Faith Healing. * Rick Aviles and Alfie Wise as Mad Dog and Batman, tow truck drivers who jump the train flatcar. * John Fiedler as the desk clerk. * Joe K≈Çecko as the Polish driver in the van who gets pulled over by Mr. Foyt. (K≈Çecko was a player in the National Football League.) * Car and Driver Magazine columnist and correspondent Brock Yates, who having created the real- life Cannonball Run, wrote the film directly for the screen, plays the race organizer of who lays down the rules at the starting line. * Director Hal Needham appears uncredited as the ambulance EMT. * Veteran Daytona 500 commentator Ken Squier appears as a California Highway Patrolman. * Veteran voice actor June Foray provided the dubbed dialogue of several of the women who escort Goldfarb in the race (\\"Seymour's girls\\", as the opening credits list them) in an uncredited performance. Production The film continued director Hal Needham's tradition of showing bloopers during the closing credits (a practice he started with Smokey and the Bandit II). Jackie Chan says this inspired him to do the same at the end of most of his films. =Original race= The film is based on the 1979 running of the Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash, an actual cross-country outlaw road race held four times in the 1970s, starting at the Red Ball Garage on 31st Street in New York City (later the Lock, Stock and Barrel Restaurant in Darien, Connecticut) and ending at the Portofino Inn in Redondo Beach, California, in Los Angeles. The screenwriter was automotive journalist Brock Yates, who had conceived the real-life Cannonball Baker event. Yates had originally proposed the race as a writer for Car and Driver. The race had only one rule: \\"All competitors will drive any vehicle of their choosing, over any route, at any speed they judge practical, between the starting point and destination. The competitor finishing with the lowest elapsed time is the winner.\\" Yates' team was the only participant in the original 1971 running, which was named after the driver Ernest \\"Cannonball\\" Baker, who drove across country in 1927 and made it in 60 hours. Yates wrote a book about it called The Sunday Driver. In 1973 it was reported John G. Avildsen and writer Eugene Price was to make a film based on the book called The Cannonball-Baker-Sea-to- Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash. The film was not made but the race did inspire the (unrelated) 1976 films Cannonball and The Gumball Rally. 1979 Race In the March 1979 race Yates formed one of 46 teams with director Hal Needham to compete with a 150-MPH van converted into an ambulance, with LA doctor Lyell Royer, and Brock's second wife, Pamela Reynolds, riding as the patient on the gurney. Although the ambulance never made it to the finish line -- the transmission gave out 50 miles short of the Redondo Beach finish line -- Yates made it to the movie as a race official and Needham as an EMT, as did the ambulance itself and even the transmission failure. The ambulance was stopped once, in Pennsylvania; that event made it into the movie, as did a cop stopping traffic in Kansas, exiting from a rodeo, to let the ambulance pass unimpeded.Hollywood Stuntman Hal Needham Plays Not My Job, National Public Radio's 'Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me', April 30, 2011. The Right Bra team was put together by rail-thin auto writer Judy Stropus, race driver Donna Mae Mims and Peggy Niemcek, whose husband was part of another entry, driving a Cadillac limo. In the movie, it became a two-woman team led by buxom Adrienne Barbeau driving a Lamborghini, but as auto writer Stropus said decades later, \\"a little editorial license never hurt anyone.\\" Yates points out in his book Cannonball!Cannonball! by Brock Yates, MotorBooks International, 2003 that Stropus's version of the race does not mention the baptism with green fluid from the porta-potty the three girls experienced when the limo overturned. =Script= The characters J.J. and Victor participate in the Cannonball Run in an ambulance: a heavily modified Dodge van. In the beginning, J.J. says to himself \\"we could get a black Trans Am\\", then answers his own question with \\"Nah that's been done\\", a reference to the Smokey and the Bandit films of Burt Reynolds and director Hal Needham. In an attempt to appear legitimate to law enforcement, the team of J.J. and Victor hires Doctor Nikolas Van Helsing, a frightening, yet friendly, physician of questionable skill played by Jack Elam. They kidnap attractive young photographer Pamela Glover (Farrah Fawcett) -- whom they nickname \\"Beauty\\" -- to be their cover patient. Beauty vehemently opposes her beastly captors at first, but eventually comes to sympathize with her captors and fall for J.J. =Development= Yates and Needham worked on a script and Al Ruddy became attached as producer. They wanted Reynolds to star, but he was reluctant to make more car-themed films. He was eventually persuaded by Needham's promise to keep the actor's schedule to only 14 days of filming, and a fee of $5 million plus a percentage of the profits. Finance came from Raymond Chow of Golden Harvest, who requested that Jackie Chan be included in the cast. \\"I did that film for all the wrong reasons\\", said Reynolds later. \\"I never liked it. I did it to help out a friend of mine, Hal Needham. And I also felt it was immoral to turn down that kind of money. I suppose I sold out so I couldn't really object to what people wrote about me.\\" Reception =Box office= A huge commercial success, The Cannonball Run opened June 19, 1981 on 1,673 screens and grossed $11,765,574 in its opening weekend, the fourth highest opening of all-time, however this was not enough to beat Superman II that opened the same weekend with a record-breaking $14,100,523. The film went on to gross $72,179,579 in the United States and Canada, making it the sixth highest-grossing film of 1981, behind Raiders of the Lost Ark, On Golden Pond, Superman II, Arthur, and Stripes. In France, The Cannonball Run sold 988,509 box office admissions in 1981. In Germany, the film sold 4,825,937 admissions, becoming the third highest-grossing film of 1981. In Japan, it was the second highest-grossing foreign film of 1982, grossing at the box office. The film grossed over worldwide, and went on to gross a worldwide total of . =Critical response= Despite its box office success, most critics reviewed the film negatively. It has received an approval rating of 30% on Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes based on 33 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film a half-star out of four, calling it \\"an abdication of artistic responsibility at the lowest possible level of ambition. In other words, they didn't even care enough to make a good lousy movie\\". Variety described the film as \\"full of terribly inside showbiz jokes and populated by what could be called Burt and Hal's Rat Pack, film takes place in that redneck never-never land where most of the guys are beer- guzzling good ole boys and all the gals are fabulously built tootsies.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times called the film \\"inoffensive and sometimes funny. Because there are only a limited number of variations that can be worked out on this same old highway race, don't bother to see it unless you're already hooked on the genre.\\" =Accolades= The film was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress for Fawcett, but lost to Diana Scarwid for the cult film Mommie Dearest. Accident On June 25, 1980 24-year-old German American stuntwoman Heidi von Beltz (1955‚Äì2015),Heidi was the daughter of Brad von Beltz (1928‚Äì1999), a veteran actor in Westerns. a former championship skier and aspiring actor, was critically injured in a car crash during production of the film. The original stunt person had left the production to attend an emergency family illness, and the stunt coordinator Bobby Bass called his then-fianc√©e von Beltz to the set for a stunt that he said was to be \\"a piece of cake\\". The car was to be driven by Jimmy Nickerson, weaving between oncoming vehicles while von Beltz rode in the passenger seat operating a smoke machine to give the impression the car was on fire. She was a world-class skier with no previous stunt driving experience. The Aston Martin car was beset with mechanical problems, including defective steering, clutch, and speedometer; it had bald tires, and no seat belts. Nickerson wanted repairs to the car but was told parts had not arrived and to \\"make do.\\" In the event the car collided head-on with a van and Von Beltz's neck was broken leaving her quadriplegic. When it became clear that von Beltz's personal injury lawsuit would exceed all available primary insurance coverage, the production's excess insurer, Interstate Fire (a subsidiary of Hollywood's favorite insurer, Fireman's Fund Insurance Company) sued von Beltz and her employer, Stuntman Inc., for a declaratory judgment that von Beltz's lawsuit was not covered under its policy. In 1988, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that there was a duty to defend, and that there was also a duty to indemnify to the extent that von Beltz was seeking recovery for mental injuries (the exclusion for bodily injuries was ruled to be enforceable).Interstate Fire & Cas. Co. v. Stuntman Inc., 861 F.2d 203 (9th Cir. 1988). She was eventually awarded $7 million although a judge reduced the amount and she ended up with $3.2 million. Much of the settlement went to her attorneys and to paying off medical bills. The industry adopted mandatory seat belts on all stunt-car work primarily due to this incident.https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/suffering-continues-paralyzed- ex-stuntwoman-24670 Remake Warner Bros. has acquired the rights to the Cannonball Run franchise and in 2016 set Etan Cohen to write and direct a remake, titled Cannonball.

Sheridan is surprised when the Inquisitor is not only human, but appears to be from Victorian England. He curtly introduces himself as Sebastian and requests to start the test immediately. When Delenn arrives, Sebastian gives her a set of wristbands which can inflict pain on her, but she has the option of removing them at any time. However, if she does so, she will fail the test. Sebastian repeatedly asks her to identify herself, refusing to accept most of her answers related to herself or her titles. He refutes her statements that she is part of a larger prophecy and her ulterior motives. Lennier comes searching for Delenn, and finds her in the isolated section while Sebastian is away. He offers to help her escape, but she insists on remaining and tells him to go. Lennier leaves but immediately approaches Sheridan, explaining the situation. Sheridan comes to Delenn's aid, but Sebastian instead starts to torture him with the same line of questioning. Feeling neither of them are worthy, Sebastian suggests finishing one of them off, but both of them beg Sebastian to take them instead. Sebastian concludes his test, revealing both of them have passed: they were willing to sacrifice themselves not for fame or glory, but for the life of a loved one in an isolated area that no one would ever hear of. He states that they are the \\"right people, in the right place, at the right time\\" for the upcoming war. As Sebastian prepares to leave, Sheridan reveals he has researched his background and concluded he really is Jack the Ripper, taken by the Vorlons from Earth in 1888. Sebastian affirms Sheridan's theory, noting that he, too, had thought he was chosen for a holy cause, which led the Vorlons to identify him as ideally suited to be an Inquisitor in the future. Sebastian leaves, his goal concluded. Meanwhile, Ambassador G'Kar seeks ways to smuggle weapons onto the Narn homeworld to fight the Centuari, a costly endeavor according to his arms dealer. Garibaldi learns of G'Kar's efforts and warns him not to use Babylon 5 as a routing point for the weapons, but does offer an alternate, safer route to bring the weapons to Narn. G'Kar tries to convince the other Narn on the station to help with the cost of the weapons but they question if the effort would be of any value and wonder if G'Kar is fit to lead them. G'Kar makes a deal that he will get communication with one of the Narn families within the day or otherwise give up his leadership position. G'Kar begs Sheridan for help, and Sheridan decides this would be a proper task for the Rangers to complete. The Rangers are successful, and the station's Narn agree to support G'Kar further. Production Straczynski was in part motivated to write this episode to make the Vorlons appear more morally ambiguous. He wanted to point out that people should not instantly fall for what others say they are. Due to a mistake in the screenplay, Sheridan remarks that Jack the Ripper committed his murders in the \\"West End\\" of London, when in fact the murders took place in the East End. After the original airing, the line was dubbed over to correct this error, and the dubbed version can be found on the DVD release. The captions have not been corrected and still refer to the \\"West End\\" of London. With reference to the gaffe, writer Straczynski has stated, \\"So I content myself with the notion that it's west...of B5. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go shoot myself.\\" Actor Wayne Alexander (who was raised in the San Joaquin Valley, California) spoke with such a convincing English accent that many UK viewers believed he was an Englishman. When he was told of this, Alexander was reportedly quite flattered. =Allusions= These are the historical, scientific, literary, cultural and other educational references found in this episode. * Sebastian's observation, \\"No greater love hath a man than he lay down his life for his brother\\", is a paraphrase from the Gospel of John. * Sebastian describes himself as, \\"Diogenes with his lamp, looking for an honest man willing to die for all the wrong reasons\\". Diogenes the Cynic was a Greek philosopher who is reputed to have sought \\"an honest man\\". * Jack the Ripper slew at least five people in London in 1888. * The limbo sets, camera motion, lighting, and the clipped cadence of the rapid-fire question- and-answers between Delenn and Sebastian were deliberately intended as an homage to \\"Once Upon a Time,\\" the penultimate episode of The Prisoner television series from the 1960s. Joe Straczynski has spoken of how influential that series was to him on several occasions, and there are several other nods throughout the course of the series. This is the most detailed, however. He later wrote the foreword to The Prisoner's Dilemma (by Jonathan Blum and Rupert Booth), a novel of The Prisoner, in which he expressed his admiration for that series.

Once used to describe only women of a high social class or status, the female equivalent of lord, now it may refer to any adult woman. Informal use of this word is sometimes euphemistic (\\"lady of the night\\" for a prostitute ) or, in American slang, condescending (equivalent to \\"mister\\" or \\"man\\"). \\"Lady\\" is also a formal title in the United Kingdom. \\"Lady\\" is used before the family name of a woman with a title of nobility or honorary title suo jure (in her own right), or the wife of a lord, a baronet, laird, or a knight, and also before the first name of the daughter of a duke, marquess, or earl.  Etymology  The word comes from Old English hl«£fdige; the first part of the word is a mutated form of hlƒÅf, \\"loaf, bread\\", also seen in the corresponding hlƒÅford, \\"lord\\". The second part is usually taken to be from the root dig-, \\"to knead\\", seen also in dough; the sense development from bread-kneader, or bread-maker, or bread-shaper, to the ordinary meaning, though not clearly to be traced historically, may be illustrated by that of \\"lord\\". The primary meaning of \\"mistress of a household\\" is now mostly obsolete, save for the term landlady and in set phrases such as \\"the lady of the house.\\" This meaning is retained in the southern states of the United States. The term is also used in titles such as First Lady and Lady Mayoress, the wives of elected or appointed officials. In many European languages the equivalent term serves as a general form of address equivalent to the English Mrs (French Madame, Spanish Se√±ora, Italian Signora, German Frau, Polish Pani, etc.). In those languages it is correct to address a woman whose name is unknown as Madame, Se√±ora, etc., but in polite English usage \\"lady\\" has for centuries only normally been a \\"term of address\\" in the plural,Oxford English Dictionary which is also the case for \\"gentleman\\". The singular vocative use was once common but has become mostly confined to poetry. In some dialects it may still be used to address an unknown woman in a brusque manner, often in an imperative or interrogatory context, analogous to \\"mister\\" for an unknown male: e.g., \\"Hey, lady, you aren't allowed in here!\\" In this usage, the word \\"lady\\" is very seldom capitalized when written. The usual English term for politely addressing a woman is Madam or Ma'am. John William Waterhouse's The Lady of Shalott, 1888 (Tate Gallery, London, England) Usage In British English, \\"lady\\" is often, but not always, simply a courteous synonym for \\"woman\\". Public toilets are often distinguished by signs showing simply \\"Ladies\\" or \\"Gentlemen\\". \\"Lady\\" has a formal and respectful quality, being used to describe a woman in old age such as \\"an old lady\\" or when speaking about a woman to a child (e.g. \\"Give the money to the lady.\\") It is used in the description of the female equivalent of a postman as a post lady. It is also used in such terms as \\"tea lady\\" and \\"sandwich lady\\" in office blocks; and informally in hospitals to refer to a female healthcare assistant as a \\"healthcare lady\\". It may be used, however incongruously, in descriptions such as \\"the cleaning lady\\" or even \\"a bag lady\\" (vagabond). The American journalist William Allen White noted one of the difficulties in his 1946 autobiography. He relates that a woman who had paid a fine for prostitution came to his newspaper to protest, not against the fact that her conviction had been reported, but that the newspaper had referred to her as a \\"woman\\" rather than a \\"lady\\". After the incident, White assured his readers, his papers referred to human females as \\"women\\", with the exception of police court characters, who were all \\"ladies\\". White's anecdote touches on a phenomenon that others have remarked on as well. In the late 19th and early twentieth century, in a difference reflected in the British historian Nancy Mitford's 1954 essay \\"U vs. non-U\\" , lower class women strongly preferred to be called \\"ladies\\" while women from higher social backgrounds were content to be identified as \\"women\\". These social class issues, while no longer as prominent in this century, have imbued some formal uses of \\"lady\\" with euphemism (e.g.: \\"my cleaning lady\\", or \\"ladies of the night\\" for prostitutes). Commenting on the word in 1953, C.S. Lewis wrote that \\"the guard at Holloway said it was a ladies' prison!\\" It remains in use, for example, as a counterpart to \\"gentleman\\", in the phrase \\"ladies and gentlemen\\", and is generally interchangeable (in a strictly informal sense) with \\"woman\\" (as in, \\"The lady at the store said I could return this item within thirty days\\"). However, some women, since the rise of second wave feminism, have objected to the term used in contexts such as the last example, arguing that the term sounds patronising and outdated when used in this way; a man in the same context would not necessarily be referred to as a \\"gentleman\\". One feminist writer, Robin Lakoff, in her book Language and Woman's Place (1975), notably raised the issue of the ways in which \\"lady\\" is not used as the counterpart of \\"gentleman\\". It is suggested by academic Elizabeth Reid Boyd that feminist usage of the word \\"lady\\" has been reclaimed in the 21st century. = British titles = Formally, \\"Lady\\" is the female counterpart to higher ranks in society, from gentlemen, through knights, to lords, and so on. During the Middle Ages, princesses or daughters of the blood royal were usually known by their first names with \\"Lady\\" prefixed, e.g. Lady Elizabeth; since Old English and Middle English did not have a female equivalent to princes or earls or other royals or nobles. Aside from the queen, women of royal and noble status simply carried the title of \\"Lady\\". As a title of nobility, the uses of \\"lady\\" in Britain are parallel to those of \\"lord\\". It is thus a less formal alternative to the full title giving the specific rank, of marchioness, countess, viscountess or baroness, whether as the title of the husband's rank by right or courtesy, or as the lady's title in her own right. A peeress's title is used with the definite article: Lord Morris's wife is \\"the Lady Morris\\". A widow's title derived from her husband becomes the dowager, e.g. The Dowager Lady Smith. The title \\"Lady\\" is also used for a woman who is the wife of a Scottish feudal baron or laird, the title \\"Lady\\" preceding the name of the barony or lairdship. In the case of younger sons of a duke or marquess, who have the courtesy title \\"Lord\\" prefixed to their given and family name, the wife is known by the husband's given and family name with \\"Lady\\" prefixed, e.g. Lady John Smith. The daughters of dukes, marquesses and earls are by courtesy \\"ladies\\"; here, that title is prefixed to the given and family name of the lady, e.g. Lady Jane Smith, and this is preserved if the lady marries a commoner, e.g. Mr John and Lady Jane Smith. \\"Lady\\" is also the customary title of the wife of a baronet or knight, but in this case without Christian name: \\"Lady\\" with the surname of the husband only, Sir John and Lady Smith. When a woman divorces a knight and he marries again, the new wife will be Lady Smith while the ex-wife becomes Jane, Lady Smith. Female members of the Order of the Garter and Order of the Thistle also receive the prefix of \\"Lady\\"; here that title is prefixed to the given and family name of the lady, e.g. Lady Marion Fraser, LT, with the post nominal LG or LT respectively, and this is preserved if the lady marries. Other meanings The special use of the word as a title of the Virgin Mary, usually Our Lady, represents the Latin Domina Nostra. In Lady Day and Lady Chapel the word is properly a genitive, representing hl«£fdigan \\"of the Lady\\". The word is also used as a title of the Wicca goddess, The Lady. Margaret Thatcher was informally referred to in the same way by many of her political colleagues when Prime Minister of Great Britain. Her husband was later created a baronet, thus making her \\"Lady Thatcher\\" as of right. After she retired, she was given a barony as Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven, and was thereafter known as \\"The Lady Thatcher\\". Elsewhere in the Commonwealth, the word is used in a similar fashion to aristocratic usage in Britain. In Ghana, for example, the consort of the Asantehene of the Ashanti people is known as Lady Julia Osei Tutu. In Nigeria, the Yoruba aristocrats Kofoworola, Lady Ademola and Oyinkansola, Lady Abayomi made use of the title due to their being the wives of British knights. In the BDSM community, many female dominants choose the title Lady as an alternative to the more commonly used Mistress.

It gradually evolved alongside the title Abbot of Abernethy, displacing that term in extant sources by the end of the 13th century. It was held by the descendants of Gille M√≠ch√©il, Earl of Fife. As Lord Abernethy, it is a subsidiary title of the Dukes of Hamilton and Brandon. The Mormaers and Earls of Fife had enjoyed the privilege of crowning new Kings of Scots. Following the failure of the main MacDuff line, and after the execution of the Stewart Murdoch, Earl of Fife in 1425, the privilege fell back to the second line of MacDuffs, those of Abernethy. Through them this honour was regarded as passing to the Douglas Earls of Angus, notably at the coronation of James III in 1460 when George Douglas, 4th Earl of Angus proclaimed \\"There! Now that I have set it upon your Grace's head, let me see who will be so bold as to move it.\\"Maxwell Vol II, p.17 This continuity has survived to the current era, most notably at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, when the then Lord Abernethy and Angus, Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 14th Duke of Hamilton bore and presented the Crown of Scotland to the Queen at St. Giles' Cathedral. Hamilton's son the 15th Duke, and the 16th Duke performed similar duties at the opening of Scottish Parliaments since 1999. Abbots and lords of Abernethy  The abbots of Abernethy were descendants of Gille M√≠ch√©il, Earl of Fife. The abbacy may have been held by √Åed (called Hugo or Eggu and other Latinised forms), son of Gille M√≠ch√©il,See genealogical chart by Dauvit Broun. but the abbacy is first attested when √Åed's son Orm is confirmed in possession of it by King William of Scotland in the 1170s, in condition for making concessions favorable to the King's new monastic establishment at Arbroath Abbey.Barrow, \\"Reign of William the Lion\\", p. 80; McGladdery, \\"Abernethy family (per. c.1260‚Äìc.1465)\\". The title of Abbot disappears in the sources during the abbacy of Laurence, with the title of dominus predominating: * Orm de Abernethy (fl. 1170s) * Laurence de Abernethy (fl. 1190s) * Hugh de Abernethy (d. 1291) * Alexander de Abernethy (d. c. 1315) Following the death of Alexander Abernethy, the title passed to his daughter Margaret who married John Stewart of Bonkyll, who assumed the title, as well as being granted the forfeited Earldom of Angus. =Douglas lords of Abernethy= His granddaughter Margaret Stewart, 4th Countess of Angus and Lady of Abernethy, had an illegitimate son by William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas.

It can be applied in different categories of work where an overall picture is needed. It is used to make conceptual distinctions and organize ideas. Strong conceptual frameworks capture something real and do this in a way that is easy to remember and apply. Isaiah Berlin used the metaphor of a \\"fox\\" and a \\"hedgehog\\" to make conceptual distinctions in how important philosophers and authors view the world. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson; 1986 New York: Simon and Schuster, introduction by M. Walzer. Berlin describes hedgehogs as those who use a single idea or organizing principle to view the world (such as Dante Alighieri, Blaise Pascal, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Plato, Henrik Ibsen and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel). Foxes, on the other hand, incorporate a type of pluralism and view the world through multiple, sometimes conflicting, lenses (examples include Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, James Joyce, William Shakespeare, Aristotle, Herodotus, Moli√®re, and Honor√© de Balzac). Economists use the conceptual framework of \\"supply\\" and \\"demand\\" to distinguish between the behavior and incentive systems of firms and consumers.Colander, David. 2013. Microeconomics, 9th edition, New York: McGraw Hill and Frank, Robert and Ben Bernanke. 2013. Principles of Microeconomics, 5th edition. New York: McGraw Hill. Like many conceptual frameworks, supply and demand can be presented through visual or graphical representations (see demand curve). Both political Science and economics use principal agent theory as a conceptual framework. The politics-administration dichotomy is a long- standing conceptual framework used in public administration. All three of these cases are examples of a macro level conceptual framework.  Overview  The use of the term conceptual framework crosses both scale (large and small theories) and contexts (social science,Moorstein, Mark. Frameworks, Conflict in Balance. marketing, applied science, art endnote #47 etc.). Its explicit definition and application can therefore vary. Conceptual frameworks are particularly useful as organizing devices in empirical research. One set of scholars has applied the notion of conceptual framework to deductive, empirical research at the micro- or individual study level. They employ American football plays as a useful metaphor to clarify the meaning of conceptual framework (used in the context of a deductive empirical study). Likewise, conceptual frameworks are abstract representations, connected to the research project's goal that direct the collection and analysis of data (on the plane of observation ‚Äì the ground). Critically, a football play is a \\"plan of action\\" tied to a particular, timely, purpose, usually summarized as long or short yardage. Presentation at the American Society for Public Administration annual conference, Washington DC March 15, This powerpoint depicts the connection between football and conceptual frameworks in the context of a large graduate student paper. The national presentation was delivered before Public Administration graduate students in Washington DC. Shields and Rangarajan (2013) argue that it is this tie to \\"purpose\\" that make American football plays such a good metaphor. They define a conceptual framework as \\"the way ideas are organized to achieve a research project's purpose\\". Like football plays, conceptual frameworks are connected to a research purpose or aim. Explanation Babbie also identifies exploration and description as purposes of empirical research is the most common type of research purpose employed in empirical research. The formal hypothesis of a scientific investigation is the framework associated with explanation. Brains et al 2011 also identify exploration, explanation and description as research purposes. Explanation is connected to hypotheses testing (as a framework). The other research purposes are not connected to a framework. Explanatory research usually focuses on \\"why\\" or \\"what caused\\" a phenomenon to occur. Formal hypotheses posit possible explanations (answers to the why question) that are tested by collecting data and assessing the evidence (usually quantitative using statistical tests). For example, Kai Huang wanted to determine what factors contributed to residential fires in U.S. cities. Three factors were posited to influence residential fires. These factors (environment, population and building characteristics) became the hypotheses or conceptual framework he used to achieve his purpose ‚Äì explain factors that influenced home fires in U.S. cities. The formal hypotheses took the form of relational statements. H1: environmental factors influence residential fire rates; H2: populations characteristics influence residential fire rates; H3: Building factors influence residential fire rates. These hypotheses could be represented visually as H1: A ‚Üí RFR; H2: B ‚Üí RFR; H3: C ‚Üí RFR where A = environmental factors; B = population characteristics; C = Building Factors and RFR = Residential Fire Rates.  Types  Several types of conceptual frameworks have been identified, and line up with a research purpose in the following ways: * Working hypothesis ‚Äì exploration or exploratory research * Pillar questions ‚Äì exploration or exploratory research * Descriptive categories ‚Äì description or descriptive research * Practical ideal type ‚Äì analysis (gauging) * Models of operations research ‚Äì decision making * Formal hypothesis ‚Äì explanation and prediction Note that Shields and Rangarajan (2013) do not claim that the above are the only framework-purpose pairing. Nor do they claim the system is applicable to inductive forms of empirical research. Rather, the conceptual framework-research purpose pairings they propose are useful and provide new scholars a point of departure to develop their own research design. Frameworks have also been used to explain conflict theory and the balance necessary to reach what amounts to resolution. Within these conflict frameworks, visible and invisible variables function under concepts of relevance. Boundaries form and within these boundaries, tensions regarding laws and chaos (or freedom) are mitigated. These frameworks often function like cells, with sub-frameworks, stasis, evolution and revolution. Anomalies may exist without adequate \\"lenses\\" or \\"filters\\" to see them and may become visible only when the tools exist to define them.Thomas Kuhn.

He achieved domestic political success as a member of parliament and later Secretary of State under King James I. He lost much of his political power after his support for a failed marriage alliance between Prince Charles and the Spanish House of Habsburg royal family. Rather than continue in politics, he resigned all of his political offices in 1625 except for his position on the Privy Council and declared his Catholicism publicly. He was created Baron Baltimore in the Peerage of Ireland upon his resignation. Baltimore Manor was located in County Longford, Ireland. Calvert took an interest in the British colonisation of the Americas, at first for commercial reasons and later to create a refuge for persecuted English Catholics. He became the proprietor of Avalon, the first sustained English settlement on the southeastern peninsula on the island of Newfoundland (off the eastern coast of modern Canada). Discouraged by its cold and sometimes inhospitable climate and the sufferings of the settlers, he looked for a more suitable spot further south and sought a new royal charter to settle the region, which would become the state of Maryland. Calvert died five weeks before the new Charter was sealed, leaving the settlement of the Maryland colony to his son Cecil (1605‚Äì1675). His second son Leonard Calvert (1606‚Äì1647) was the first colonial governor of the Province of Maryland. Family and early life Coat of Arms of George Calvert Little is known of the ancestry of the Yorkshire branch of the Calverts. At George Calvert's knighting, it was claimed that his family originally came from Flanders (a Dutch-speaking area today across the English Channel in modern Belgium).Browne, p. 2. Calvert's father, (an earlier) Leonard, was a country gentleman who had achieved some prominence as a tenant of Lord Wharton,Krugler, p. 28. and was wealthy enough to marry a \\"gentlewoman\\" of a noble line, Alicia or Alice Crossland (sometimes spelled \\"Crosland\\"). He established his family on the estate of the later-built Kiplin Hall, near Catterick in Yorkshire.Browne, p. 3. George Calvert was born at Kiplin in late 1579. His mother Alicia/Alice died on 28 November 1587, when he was eight years old. His father then married Grace Crossland (sometimes spelled: \\"Crosland\\"), Alicia's first cousin. In 1569, Sir Thomas Gargrave had described Richmond as a territory where all gentlemen were \\"evil in religion\\", by which he meant predominately Roman Catholic; it appears Leonard Calvert was no exception. During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, continuing the changes wrought earlier in the century by her father King Henry VIII which made the monarch the supreme authority of the Christian Church in England, continuing the Protestant Reformation from the continent of Europe, with the political, spiritual and temporal separation from the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope/Papacy in Rome, the Royal Government exerted authority over the matters of religious faith, practices and the Church. Acts mandating compulsory religious uniformity were enacted by Parliament and enforced through penal laws.Krugler, pp. 12‚Äì16; From 1571, graduated fines were imposed on anyone attending mass in the Roman Catholic church, and generous rewards were offered to informers of the crime. Middleton, p. 95. The Acts of Supremacy and the Uniformity Act of 1559 also included an oath of allegiance to the Queen and an implicit denial of the Pope's (then Pope Paul IV) authority over the English Church. This oath was required of any subject who wished to hold high office, attend university, or take advantage of opportunities controlled by the state (king/kingdom).Krugler, pp. 12‚Äì16. The Calvert household suffered the intrusion of the Elizabethan-era religious laws. From the year of George's birth onward, his father, Leonard Calvert, was subjected to repeated harassment by the Yorkshire authorities, who in 1580 extracted a promise of conformity from him, compelling his attendance at the Church of England services.Krugler, pp. 28‚Äì30. In 1592, when George was twelve, the authorities denounced one of his tutors for teaching \\"from a popish primer\\" and instructed Leonard and Grace to send George and his brother Christopher to a Protestant tutor and, if necessary, to present the children before the commission \\"once a month to see how they perfect in learning\\". As a result, the boys were sent to a Protestant tutor called Fowberry at Bilton. The senior Calvert had to give a \\"bond of conformity\\"; he was banned from employing any Catholic servants and forced to purchase an English Bible, which was to \\"lie open in his house for everyone to read\\". In 1593, records show that Grace Calvert was committed to the custody of a \\"pursuivant\\", an official responsible for identifying and persecuting Catholics, and in 1604 she was described as the \\"wife of Leonard Calvert of Kipling, non-communicant at Easter last\\". George Calvert went up to Trinity College at Oxford University, matriculating in 1593/94, where he studied foreign languages and received a bachelor's degree in 1597. As the oath of allegiance was compulsory after the age of sixteen, he would almost certainly have pledged conformity while at Oxford. The same pattern of conformity, whether pretended or sincere, continued through Calvert's early life. After Oxford, he moved in 1598 to London, where he studied municipal law at Lincoln's Inn for three years.Krugler, p. 30. Marriage and family In November 1604 he married Anne Mynne (or Mayne), daughter of George Mynne of Hertingfordbury and his wife Elizabeth Wroth, in a Protestant Church of England ceremony at St Peter's, Cornhill, Middlesex, where his address was registered as St Martin in the Fields.Krugler, p. 32. His children, including his eldest son and heir Cecil, who was born in the winter of 1605‚Äì06, were all baptised in the Church of England. When Anne died on 8 August 1622, she was buried at Calvert's local Protestant parish church, St Martin-in-the-Fields. Calvert had a total of thirteen children: Cecil, who succeeded his father as the 2nd Baron Baltimore, Leonard, Anne, Mary, Dorothy, Elizabeth, Grace, who married Sir Robert Talbot, 2nd Baronet of Carton, County Kildare, Francis, George, Helen, Henry, John, and Philip. Political success Calvert named his son \\"Cecilius\\" (1605‚Äì1675) for Sir Robert Cecil, first Earl of Salisbury (1563‚Äì1612),Browne, p. 4.Fiske, p. 255. spymaster to Queen Elizabeth, whom Calvert had met during an extended trip to the European mainland between 1601 and 1603, after which he became known as a specialist in foreign affairs. Calvert carried a packet for Cecilius from Paris, and so entered the service of the principal engineer of King James VI of Scotland's succession to the English throne in 1603 (when he also assumed the title of King James I of England.) King James rewarded Robert Cecil, whom he made a Privy Councillor and secretary of state, with the granting of the title of Earl of Salisbury in 1605 and Lord High Treasurer in 1608, making him the most powerful man at the royal court. As Cecil rose, Calvert rose with him. Calvert's foreign languages, legal training, and discretion made him an invaluable aide to Robert Cecil who, no lover of Catholics, seems to have accepted Calvert's conformity as beyond question. Working at the centre of court politics, Calvert exploited his influence by selling favours, an accepted practice for the times.Krugler, p. 31. Calvert accumulated a number of small offices, honours, and sinecures. In August 1605, he attended the King at Oxford, and received an honorary master-of-arts degree in an elaborate ceremony at which the Duke of Lennox (Ludovic Stewart), the earls of Oxford and Northumberland, and Cecilius received degrees.Browne, p. 4; Krugler, p. 32. Given the prestige of the other graduates, Calvert's was the last awarded, but his presence in such company signalled his growing stature. In 1606 the king made Calvert \\"clerk of the Crown\\" and \\"Assizes in Connaught\\", County Clare, Ireland, his first royal appointment.Krugler, p. 33. In 1609, James appointed him a \\"clerk of the Signet office\\", a post which required the preparation of documents for the royal signature and brought Calvert into close contact with the king. Calvert also served in James's First Parliament as a member for the borough of Bossiney, in the county of Cornwall, installed there by Cecil to support his policies.Browne, pp. 3‚Äì4. In 1610, Calvert was appointed a \\"clerk of the Privy Council\\". Each of these positions would have required an oath of allegiance. With Robert Cecil's support, George Calvert came into his own as an adviser and supporter of King James. In 1610 and 1611, Calvert undertook missions to the continent on behalf of the King, visiting a number of embassies in Paris, Holland, and the Duchy of Cleves,Krugler, p. 35. and acting as an ambassador to the French Royal Court during the coronation of King Louis XIII (1601‚Äì1643) in 1610.Browne, p. 5. A correspondent from France reported that Calvert gave \\"everyone great contentment with his discreet conversation.\\" In 1615, James sent him to the continental Electorate of the Palatinate (German) in the Holy Roman Empire, whose impoverished elector, Frederick V, Elector Palatine (1596‚Äì1632), had married James's daughter Elizabeth of Bohemia (1596‚Äì1662) in 1613.Krugler, p. 39. Calvert had to convey the King's disapproval that Elizabeth, for lack of money, had given away expensive jewels to a gentlewoman leaving her employ. Elector Frederick's decision in 1619 to accept the throne of Bohemia triggered a war with the powerful neighbouring Habsburg dynasty of Austria to the southwest in Vienna, which James attempted to end through a proposed alliance with the Kingdom of Spain.Krugler, p. 40. In 1611, James employed Calvert to research and transcribe his tract against the Dutch Protestant theologian Conrad Vorstius (1569‚Äì1622).Krugler, p. 36. The following year, Cecil died, and Calvert acted as one of the four executors of his will. The king's favourite, Sir Robert Carr, first Earl of Somerset (1587‚Äì1645), Viscount Rochester, assumed the duties of secretary of state and recruited Calvert to assist with foreign policy, in particular the Latin and Spanish correspondence.Krugler, p. 37. Carr, soon raised to the earldom of Somerset, was not a success in the job, and fell from favour partly as a result of the murder of Thomas Overbury (1581‚Äì1613), to which Carr's wife Frances, the former Countess of Essex and later Somerset (1590‚Äì1632), pleaded guilty in 1615. Carr's place as James's principal favourite was now taken by the handsome George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham (1592‚Äì1628), with whom James was said to have been infatuated.Stewart, p. 265. Kiplin Hall, estate built by Sir George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore (1579‚Äì1632) in the 1620s In 1613 the King commissioned Calvert to investigate Roman Catholic grievances in Ireland, along with Sir Humphrey Wynch (1555‚Äì1625), Sir Charles Cornwallis (XXX?-1629) and Sir Roger Wilbraham (1553‚Äì1616). The commission spent almost four months in Ireland, and its final report, partly drafted by Calvert, concluded that religious conformity should be enforced more strictly in Ireland, Catholic schools be suppressed, and bad priests removed and punished.Krugler, p. 38. The King resolved not to reconvene the Parliament of Ireland until the Catholics \\"shall be better disciplined\\". In 1616 James endowed Calvert with the manor of Danby Wiske in Yorkshire, which brought him into contact with Sir Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford (1593‚Äì1641), who became his closest friend and political ally.Krugler, p. 38 and p. 83. Calvert was now wealthy enough to buy the Kiplin Hall estate in his home parish. (Today, the University of Maryland operates a research centre there, while the main building is a house museum owned by the Kiplin Hall Trust.) In 1617 his social status received a further boost when he was knighted, then becoming Sir George Calvert. In 1619, Calvert completed his rise to power when James appointed him as one of the two principal secretaries of state. This followed the dismissal of Sir Thomas Lake (1567‚Äì1630) due to scandals, including his wife's indiscretions with state secrets.Browne, p. 6. Not emerging as a candidate until the end of the selection process, Calvert's appointment surprised him and most observers. Assuming he owed his promotion to the king's increasingly powerful favourite George Villiers (1592‚Äì1628) (later first Duke of Buckingham), he sent him a great jewel as a token of thanks. Villiers returned the jewel, saying he had had nothing to do with the matter.Krugler. pp. 41‚Äì42. Calvert's personal fortune was secured when he was additionally appointed a \\"commissioner of the treasury\\" with a pension of ¬£1,000 pounds sterling and a subsidy on imported raw silk, which would later be converted to another ¬£1,000 pension.Browne, p. 8; Brugger, p. 4. Secretary of State James I, painted by Daniel Mytens in 1621. James made Calvert the first Baron Baltimore in 1625, in recognition of his services to the Crown. In Parliament, a political crisis developed over the king's policy of seeking a Spanish wife for Charles, Prince of Wales, as part of a proposed alliance with the Habsburgs.Krugler, p. 24. In the parliament of 1621, it fell to Calvert to advocate the Spanish Match, as it came to be called, against the majority of Parliament, who feared an increase in Catholic influence on the state.Krugler, pp. 24‚Äì5. As a result of his pro-Spanish stance and defence of relaxations in the penal laws against Catholics, Calvert became estranged from many in the Commons, who were suspicious of his close familiarity with the Spanish ambassador's court.Krugler, pp. 49‚Äì51. Calvert also faced difficulties in his private life: his wife's death on 8 August 1622 left him the single father of ten children, the oldest of whom, Cecil, was sixteen years old.Browne, p. 11. King James rewarded Calvert in 1623 for his loyalty by granting him a estate in County Longford, in the Irish province of Leinster, where his seat was known as the \\"Manor of Baltimore\\".Brugger, p. 4. Calvert was increasingly isolated from court circles as the Prince of Wales, (heir to the throne) and George Villiers wrested control of policy from the ageing James. Without consulting the diplomatically astute Calvert, the prince and the duke travelled to Spain to negotiate the Spanish marriage for themselves, with disastrous results.Krugler, pp. 61‚Äì3. Instead of securing an alliance, the visit provoked a hostility between the two courts which quickly led to war. In a reversal of policy, Buckingham dismissed the treaties with Spain, summoned a war council, and sought a French marriage for the Prince of Wales.Krugler, pp. 63‚Äì64. Resignation and conversion to Catholicism As the chief parliamentary spokesman for an abandoned policy, Calvert no longer served a useful purpose to the English Royal Court, and by February 1624 his duties had been restricted to placating the Spanish ambassador.Krugler, p. 66. The degree of his disfavour was shown when he was reprimanded for supposedly delaying diplomatic letters. Calvert bowed to the inevitable. On the pretext of ill health, he began negotiations for the sale of his position, finally resigning the secretariat in February 1625.Krugler, pp. 65‚Äì66. No disgrace was attached to Calvert's departure from office: the King, to whom he had always remained personally loyal, confirmed his place on the Privy Council and appointed him Baron Baltimore, in County Longford in Leinster in central Ireland.\\"On 16th/26th February, in recompense for past services, King James I appointed Calvert Baron Baltimore of Baltimore, in County Longford, Ireland.\\" Codignola, 12; In March, Lord Carew wrote: \\"Calvert is removed from his place as secretary of state, but yet without disgrace, for the king hath created him baron of Baltimore in Ireland, and remaynes a councillor\\". Krugler, p. 74. Immediately after Calvert resigned, he converted to Roman Catholicism.Amerigo Salvetti, Tuscan representative in London, wrote in his January‚ÄìFebruary newsletter \\"being resolved for the future to live and die as a Catholic, he knew he could not serve him [the duke] where he was without the jealousy of the state and danger from Parliament.\\" Krugler, p. 74. The connection between Calvert's resignation and his conversion to Roman Catholicism was a complex one. George Cottington, a former employee of Calvert, suggested in 1628 that Calvert's conversion had been in progress a long time before it was made public.Codignola, p. 12. George Abbot (1562‚Äì1633), the reigning Archbishop of Canterbury (and ecclesiastical head of the independent Church of England), reported that political opposition to Calvert, combined with his loss of office, had \\"made him discontented and, as the saying is, \\"Desperatio facit monachum\\", so hee apparently did turne papist, which hee now professeth, this being the third time that he hath bene to blame that way [sic]\\".Krugler, p. 69. Abbot's remark suggests previous wavering on Calvert's part; Krugler speculates that the two previous times \\"he had bene to blame that way\\" were during his childhood, when his Catholic family was forced to become Protestant, and during the period of distress and doubt Calvert experienced after the death of his wife. Godfrey Goodman, the Bishop of Gloucester, later claimed Calvert had been a secret Catholic all along (\\"infinitely addicted to the Catholic faith\\"), which explained his support for lenient policies towards Catholics and for the Spanish match.Krugler, p. 70. No-one had questioned Calvert's conformity at the time, and if he had been secretly Catholic, he had hidden it well. It seems more likely Calvert converted in late 1624. At the time, Simon Stock, a Discalced Carmelite priest reported to the Congregation Propaganda Fide\\"The Sacred Congregation de propaganda fide, officially established by Pope Gregory XV on 22 June 1622, with the papal bull: \\"Inscrutabile divinae providentiae\\", had the double mission of spreading the \\"True Faith\\" among the infidels and of protecting it wherever Catholics lived side-by-side with non-Catholics. 'Propaganda' was meant to pursue these goals by co-ordinating all missionary activities and centralising information on foreign lands ... on the global chessboard on which Propaganda was operating, England was one of its most difficult problems.\\", Codignola, p. 9. in Rome on 15 November that he had converted two Privy Councillors to Catholicism, one of whom historians are certain was Calvert.Letter of Simon Stock, 15 November 1624 quoted by Codignola, p. 11. Calvert, who had probably met Stock at the Spanish embassy in London, later worked with the priest on a plan for a Catholic mission in his new first Newfoundland Colony (off modern Canada).Codignola, p. 11. When King James I died in March 1625, his successor Charles I maintained Calvert's barony but not his previous place on the Privy Council.Browne, p. 14; Fiske, p. 256; Codignola, p. 12; Krugler, p. 5. Calvert then turned his attention to his Irish estates and his overseas investments. He was not entirely forgotten at court.Krugler, p. 78. After Buckingham's dabblings in wars against Spain and France had ended in failure, he recalled Baltimore to court, and for a while may have considered employing him in the peace negotiations with Spain.The Venetian ambassador wrote \\"Should this new scheme attain the king's assent, he [Baltimore] will be employed in it, because they consider him to be a staunch Spaniard\\". But later he wrote, \\"Because he is so notoriously a Spaniard the king cannot employ him from lack of confidence\\". Krugler, p. 90. Though nothing came of Baltimore's recall, he renewed his rights over the silk-import duties, which had lapsed with the death of James I,Krugler, pp. 90‚Äì91. and secured Charles' blessing for his venture in the \\"New Found Land\\". Colony of Avalon (Newfoundland) Calvert had long maintained an interest in the exploration and settlement of the New World, beginning with his investment of twenty-five pounds in the second Virginia Company in 1609, and a few months later a more substantial sum in the East India Company, which he increased in 1614.Krugler, pp. 33‚Äì4 and 39; He later also became a member of the New England Company which founded the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1622. Browne, p. 15. In 1620, Calvert purchased a tract of land in Newfoundland from Sir William Vaughan (1575‚Äì1641), a Welsh writer and colonial investor, who had earlier failed to establish a colony on the large subarctic island off the eastern coast of North America. He named the area of the peninsula as Avalon, after the legendary spot where Christianity was supposedly introduced to Roman Britain in ancient times.Browne, p. 16. The plantation lay on what is now called the Avalon PeninsulaBetween the modern towns of Fermeuse and Aquaforte. and included the fishing station at \\"Ferryland\\".Fiske, p. 256. Calvert almost certainly had a fishery project in mind at this stage.Pope, p. 32. Sketch of Sir George Calvert, first Baron and Lord Baltimore (1579‚Äì1632), c. 1620 Calvert dispatched Captain Edward Wynne and a group of Welsh colonists to Ferryland, where they landed in August 1621, and set about constructing a settlement.Browne, p. 16; Codignola, p. 10. Wynne sent positive reports concerning the potential for local fisheries and for the production of salt, hemp, flax, tar, iron, timber and hops.Browne, p. 16; Wynne promised to send Calvert a barrel of the best salt that ever \\"my eyes beheld\\". Krugler, p. 79. Wynne also praised the climate, declaring, \\"It is better and not so cold as England,\\" and predicted that the colony would become self-sufficient after one year.Krugler, p. 79. Others corroborated Wynne's reports: for example, Captain Daniel Powell, who delivered a further party of settlers to Ferryland, wrote: \\"The land on which our Governor [Calvert and/or Wynne] planted is so good and commodious, that for the quantity, I think there is no better in many parts of England\\"; but he added ominously that Ferryland was \\"the coldest harbour in the land\\".When Calvert wintered in the colony in 1628‚Äì29, he would write of being deceived by the \\"lying letters of the Governors and such\\". Krugler, p. 79. Wynne and his men began work on various building projects, including a substantial house and the shoring up of the harbour. To protect them against marauding French warships, a recent hazard in the area, since the recent founding of New France in the interior (modern Lower Canada of the 18th and 19th centuries, Province of Quebec and Dominion of Canada) along the St. Lawrence River, Calvert employed the pirate John Nutt.When Nutt was captured in 1623 after switching his activities to the Irish Sea, Calvert had him released, and his captor Captain Eliot imprisoned for malfeasance of office. Krugler, p. 82. The settlement appeared to be progressing so well that in January 1623, Calvert obtained a concession from King James for the whole of Newfoundland, though the grant was soon reduced to cover only the southeastern Avalon peninsula, owing to competing claims from other English colonists.Browne, p. 17; Codignola, p. 10. The final Charter constituted the province as a \\"county palatinate\\", officially titled the \\"Province of Avalon\\", under Calvert's personal rule.Browne, p. 17; Fiske, p. 256; A Palatinate was a province governed by a semi-autonomous agent in the King's name. Calvert, who had in April 1621, opposed attempts by the House of Commons in the English Parliament to extend their authority to the fishing rights in the \\"Americas\\"/\\"New World\\", believed that plantations: \\"are not yet annexed to the Crown of England, but are the King's as gotten him by conquest\\" governed according to the King's Prerogative, as he saw fit. Krugler, p. 78. After resigning the Royal secretariat of state in 1625, the new Baron Baltimore made clear his intention to visit the colony: \\"I intend shortly,\\" he wrote in March, \\"God willing, a journey for Newfoundland to visit a plantation which I began there some few years since.\\"Krugler, pp. 75 and 84. His plans were disrupted by the death of King James I, and by the crackdown on Catholics with which King Charles I began his reign to appease his opponents. The new King required all privy councillors to take the oaths of supremacy and allegiance; and since Baltimore, as a Catholic, had to refuse, he was obliged to step down from that cherished office.Charles accepted Baltimore's refusal with good grace. \\"His ability to manipulate the government for his own purposes over the next few years belies any suggestion that the government hounded him out of England.\\" Krugler, pp. 85‚Äì7. Given the new religious and political climate, and perhaps also to escape a serious outbreak of plague in England, Baltimore moved to his estates in Ireland. His expedition to Newfoundland had set sail without him in late May 1625 under Sir Arthur Aston, who became the new provincial Governor of Avalon.Krugler, pp. 85‚Äì86. Aston was granted a royal licence for the voyage in return for bringing back some hawks and elks for the king. A reference by David Rothe, bishop of Ossary in Ireland, to a \\"Joane [also recorded as Jane] Baltimore now wife\\" of Calvert, reveals that Baltimore had recently remarried.Since there is not a record of the marriage, it would certainly have been a Catholic one. Krugler, p. 86. From the time of his conversion in 1625 onwards, Baltimore took care to cater for the religious needs of his colonists, both Catholic and Protestant. He had asked Simon Stock to provide priests for the 1625 expedition,Stock wrote to his superiors that the \\"Avalon gentleman\\", as he cautiously called Baltimore, \\"desires to take with him two or three brethren to sow the Sacred Faith in that land.\\" Krugler, p. 89. but Stock's recruits arrived in England after Aston had sailed. Stock's own ambitions for the colony appear to have exceeded Baltimore's: in letters to De Propaganda Fide in Rome, Stock claimed the Newfoundland settlement could act as a springboard for the conversion of natives not only in the New World but also in China, the latter via a passage he believed existed from the east coast to the Pacific Ocean.Codignola, p. 25; Stock conceived the Avalon colony as a base for conversion, lest the natives \\"become pernicious heretics\\" under the influence of Protestant settlers. Krugler, p. 89. Baltimore in Avalon Baltimore was determined to visit his colony in person. In May 1626, he wrote to Wentworth: George Calvert by Dani√´l Mijtens Aston's return to England in late 1626,Aston died the following year in the siege of √éle de R√©, opposite La Rochelle, in the service of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham. Codignola, p. 42. along with all the Catholic settlers, failed to deter Baltimore, who finally sailed for Newfoundland in 1627, arriving on 23 July and staying only two months before returning to England.Browne, p. 18. He had taken both Protestant and Catholic settlers with him, as well as two secular priests, Thomas Longville and Anthony Pole (also known as Smith), the latter remaining behind in the colony when Baltimore departed for England. The land Baltimore had seen was by no means the paradise described by some early settlers, being only marginally productive;Browne, pp. 18‚Äì19. as the summer climate was deceptively mild, his brief visit gave Baltimore no reason to alter his plans for the colony. In 1628 he sailed again for Newfoundland, this time with his second wife Jane, most of his children,He left his eldest son Cecil at home to supervise his lands and his affairs. Krugler, p. 95. and 40 more settlers, to officially take over as Proprietary Governor of Avalon.Browne, p. 19; Fiske, page 261. He and his family moved into the house at Ferryland built by Wynne, a sizeable structure for the time, by colonial standards, and the only one in the settlement large enough to accommodate religious services for the community.The building was a two-storey longhouse, fifteen by forty-four feet, probably of stone, partly roofed with boards and partly with \\"sedge, flagges, and rushes\\"; it had a stone kitchen and chimney, a parlour, a two-room storehouse, a smithy, saltworks, brewhouse, henhouse, and tenements. Pope, p. 128. Matters connected to religion were to bedevil Baltimore's stay in \\"this remote part of the worlde where I have planted my selfe [sic]\\". He sailed at a time when English military preparations were underway to relieve the Huguenots at La Rochelle. He was dismayed to find that the war with France had spread to Newfoundland, and that he had to spend most of his time fighting off French attacks on English fishing fleets with his own ships the Dove and the Ark.Browne, p. 20; Fiske, p. 261. As he wrote to Buckingham, \\"I came to builde, and sett, and sowe, but I am falne to fighting with Frenchmen [sic]\\". His settlers were so successful against the French that they captured several ships, which they escorted back to England to help with the war effort. Baltimore was granted the loan of one of the ships to aid in his defence of the colony, as well as a share of the prize money.Krugler, p. 95. Adopting a policy of free religious worship in the colony, Baltimore allowed the Catholics to worship in one part of his house and the Protestants in another. This novel arrangement proved too much for the resident Anglican priest, Erasmus Stourton‚Äî\\"that knave Stourton\\", as Baltimore referred to him‚Äîwho, after altercations with Baltimore, was placed on a ship for England, where he lost no time in reporting Baltimore's practices to the authorities, complaining that the Catholic priests Smith and Hackett said mass every Sunday and \\"doe use all other ceremonies of the church of Rome in as ample a manner as tis used in Spayne [sic]\\".Krugler, p. 97. Baltimore's tolerance went down no better with the Catholics: Propaganda banned Catholics from worshipping in the same house as \\"heretics\\", but in practice Baltimore's house in Ferryland was the only option for either denomination. Krugler, p. 98. and that Baltimore had the son of a Protestant forcibly baptised as a Catholic.Codignola, p. 53. Although Stourton's complaints were investigated by the Privy Council, due to Baltimore's support in high places the case was dismissed.Browne, pp. 23‚Äì24; Fiske, p. 261; Codignola, p. 53; Baltimore thanked the king for \\"protecting me also against calumny and malice\\" of those who sought \\"to make me seem foule\\" in your eyes. Krugler, p. 100. Baltimore had become disenchanted with conditions in \\"this wofull country\\", and he wrote to his old acquaintances in England lamenting his troubles.Codignola, p. 53; Browne, pp. 19‚Äì20. The final blow to his hopes was dealt by the Newfoundland winter of 1628‚Äì9, which did not release its grip until May. Like others before them, the residents of Avalon suffered terribly from the cold and from malnutrition.Browne, p. 24; Fiske, p. 261. Nine or ten of Baltimore's company died that winter, and with half the settlers ill at one time, his house had to be turned into a hospital. The sea froze over, and nothing would grow before May. \\"Tis not terra Christianorum\\", Baltimore wrote to Wentworth.Krugler, p. 102. He confessed to the king: \\"I have found...by too deare bought experience [that which other men] always concealed from me...that there is a sad face of wynter upon all this land\\". Baltimore solicited a new charter from the king. To found an alternative colony in a less hostile climate further south, he requested \\"a precinct\\" in Virginia, where he could grow tobacco.Browne, pp. 24‚Äì25. He wrote to his friends Francis Cottington and Thomas Wentworth enlisting their support for this new proposal, admitting the impression his abandonment of Avalon might make in England: \\"I shall rayse a great deal of talke and discourse and be censured by most men of giddiness and levity [sic]\\".Letter to Wentworth. Krugler, p. 102. The king, perhaps guided by Baltimore's friends at court, replied expressing concern for Baltimore's health and gently advising him to forget colonial schemes and return to England, where he would be treated with every respect: \\"Men of your condition and breeding are fitter for other imployments than the framing of new plantations, which commonly have rugged & laborious beginnings, and require much greater meanes, in managing them, than usually the power of one private subject can reach unto\\".Codignola, p. 54. Baltimore sent his children home to England in August. By the time the king's letter reached Avalon, he had departed with his wife and servants for Virginia.Browne, p. 27. Attempt to found a Mid-Atlantic colony In late September or October 1629, Baltimore arrived in Jamestown, where the Virginians, who suspected him of designs on some of their territory and vehemently opposed Catholicism, gave him a cool welcome. They gave him the oaths of supremacy and allegiance, which he refused to take, so they ordered him to leave.Browne, p. 27; Fiske, pp. 263‚Äì4; The Virginians may also have nursed unpleasant memories of Baltimore's membership of the Virginia Company board, when James I had revoked its original charter in 1624. Krugler, pp. 104‚Äì5. After no more than a few weeks in the colony, Baltimore left for England to pursue the new charter, leaving his wife and servants behind.Browne, p. 28. In early 1630 he procured a ship to fetch them, but it foundered off the Irish coast, and his wife was drowned.Krugler, pp. 106‚Äì7. Baltimore described himself the following year as \\"a long time myself a Man of Sorrows\\".Krugler, p. 117. Baltimore spent the last two years of his life constantly lobbying for his new charter, though the obstacles proved difficult. The Virginians, led by William Claiborne, who sailed to England to make the case, campaigned aggressively against separate colonising of the Chesapeake, claiming they possessed the rights to that area.Krugler, p. 107. Baltimore was short of capital, having exhausted his fortune, and was sometimes forced to depend on the assistance of his friends. To make matters worse, in the summer of 1630 his household was infected by the plague, which he survived. He wrote to Wentworth: \\"Blessed be God for it who hath preserved me now from shipwreck, hunger, scurvy and pestilence...\\"Krugler, p. 108. His health declining, Baltimore's persistence over the charter finally paid off in 1632. The king first granted him a location south of Jamestown, but Baltimore asked the king to reconsider in response to opposition from other investors interested in settling the new land of Carolina into a sugar plantation.Fiske, p. 265. Baltimore eventually compromised by accepting redrawn boundaries to the north of the Potomac River, on either side of the Chesapeake Bay.Browne, p. 17. The charter was about to pass when the fifty-two-year-old Baltimore died in his lodgings at Lincoln's Inn Fields, on 15 April 1632.Browne, p. 31; Krugler, p. 118. Five weeks later, on 20 June 1632, the charter for Maryland passed the seals.Krugler, p. 118. Legacy The state flag of Maryland is the banner of Baltimore's coat-of-arms (Calvert, his father's family, in the first and fourth quarters, and Crossland, his mother's family, in the second and third quarters). In his will, written the day before he died, Baltimore beseeched his friends Wentworth and Cottington to act as guardians and supervisors to his first son Cecil, who inherited the title of Lord Baltimore and the imminent grant of Maryland.Browne, p. 31; Fiske, pp. 265‚Äì266; Krugler, p. 118. Baltimore's two colonies in the New World continued under the proprietorship of his family.Browne, pp. 31‚Äì32. Avalon, which remained a prime spot for the salting and export of fish, was expropriated by Sir David Kirke, with a new royal charter which Cecil Calvert vigorously challenged, and it was finally absorbed into Newfoundland in 1754.Browne, p. 32; Pope, p. 6. Although Baltimore's failed Avalon venture marked the end of an early era of attempts at proprietary colonisation, it laid the foundation upon which permanent settlements developed in that region of Newfoundland.Pope, p. 4. Maryland became a prime tobacco exporting colony in the mid-Atlantic and, for a time, a refuge for Catholic settlers, as George Calvert had hoped.Hennesey, pp. 36‚Äì45. Under the rule of the Lords Baltimore, thousands of British Catholics emigrated to Maryland, establishing some of the oldest Catholic communities in what later became the United States. Catholic rule in Maryland was eventually nullified by the re-assertion of royal control over the colony. One hundred and forty years after its first settlement, Maryland joined twelve other British colonies along the Atlantic coast in declaring their independence from British rule and the right to freedom of religion for all citizens in the new United States.Hennesey, pp. 55‚Äì68. The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor. Notes References  * Fiske, John (1897). Old Virginia and Her Neighbors. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. * Hennesey, James (1981).

It is mainly produced by the liver, and also locally synthesized by macrophages, fibroblasts, and adrenocortical cells. In humans it is encoded by the A2M gene. Alpha 2 macroglobulin acts as an antiprotease and is able to inactivate an enormous variety of proteinases. It functions as an inhibitor of fibrinolysis by inhibiting plasmin and kallikrein. It functions as an inhibitor of coagulation by inhibiting thrombin. Alpha-2-macroglobulin may act as a carrier protein because it also binds to numerous growth factors and cytokines, such as platelet-derived growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, TGF-Œ≤, insulin, and IL-1Œ≤. No specific deficiency with associated disease has been recognized, and no disease state is attributed to low concentrations of alpha-2-macroglobulin. The concentration of alpha-2-macroglobulin rises 10-fold or more in the nephrotic syndrome when other lower molecular weight proteins are lost in the urine. The loss of alpha-2-macroglobulin into urine is prevented by its large size. The net result is that alpha-2-macroglobulin reaches serum levels equal to or greater than those of albumin in the nephrotic syndrome, which has the effect of maintaining oncotic pressure.  Structure  Human alpha-2-macroglobulin is composed of four identical subunits bound together by -S-S- bonds. In addition to tetrameric forms of alpha-2-macroglobulin, dimeric, and more recently monomeric aM protease inhibitors have been identified. Each monomer of human alpha-2-macroglobulin is composed of several functional domains, including macroglobulin domains, a thiol ester-containing domain and a receptor-binding domain. Overall, alpha-2-Macroglobulin is the largest major nonimmunoglobulin protein in human plasma. The amino acid sequence of alpha-2-macroglobulin has been shown to be 71% the same as that of the Pregnancy zone protein.  Function  The alpha-macroglobulin (aM) family of proteins includes protease inhibitors, typified by the human tetrameric alpha-2-macroglobulin (a2M); they belong to the MEROPS proteinase inhibitor family I39, clan IL. These protease inhibitors share several defining properties, which include (i) the ability to inhibit proteases from all catalytic classes, (ii) the presence of a 'bait region' (aka. a sequence of amino acids in an Œ±2-macroglobulin molecule, or a homologous protein, that contains scissile peptide bonds for those proteinases that it inhibits) and a thiol ester, (iii) a similar protease inhibitory mechanism and (iv) the inactivation of the inhibitory capacity by reaction of the thiol ester with small primary amines. aM protease inhibitors inhibit by steric hindrance. The mechanism involves protease cleavage of the bait region, a segment of the aM that is particularly susceptible to proteolytic cleavage, which initiates a conformational change such that the aM collapses about the protease. In the resulting aM-protease complex, the active site of the protease is sterically shielded, thus substantially decreasing access to protein substrates. Two additional events occur as a consequence of bait region cleavage, namely (i) the h-cysteinyl-g-glutamyl thiol ester becomes highly reactive and (ii) a major conformational change exposes a conserved COOH-terminal receptor binding domain (RBD). RBD exposure allows the aM protease complex to bind to clearance receptors and be removed from circulation. Tetrameric, dimeric, and, more recently, monomeric aM protease inhibitors have been identified. alpha-2-Macroglobulin is able to inactivate an enormous variety of proteinases (including serine-, cysteine-, aspartic- and metalloproteinases). It functions as an inhibitor of fibrinolysis by inhibiting plasmin and kallikrein. It functions as an inhibitor of coagulation by inhibiting thrombin. Alpha-2-macroglobulin has in its structure a 35 amino acid \\"bait\\" region. Proteinases binding and cleaving the bait region become bound to Œ±2M. The proteinase-Œ±2M complex is recognised by macrophage receptors and cleared from the system. Fibrinolysis (simplified). Blue arrows denote stimulation, and red arrows inhibition. alpha-2-Macroglobulin is known to bind zinc, as well as copper in plasma, even more strongly than albumin, and such it is also known as transcuprein. 10-15% of copper in human plasma is chelated by alpha-2-macroglobulin.  Disease  alpha-2-Macroglobulin levels are increased when the serum albumin levels are low, which is most commonly seen in nephrotic syndrome, a condition wherein the kidneys start to leak out some of the smaller blood proteins. Because of its size, alpha-2-macroglobulin is retained in the bloodstream. Increased production of all proteins means alpha-2-macroglobulin concentration increases. This increase has little adverse effect on the health, but is used as a diagnostic clue. Longstanding chronic kidney failure can lead to amyloid by alpha-2-macroglobulin (see main article: amyloid). A common variant (29.5%) (polymorphism) of alpha-2-macroglobulin leads to increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. alpha-2-Macroglobulin binds to and removes the active forms of the gelatinase (MMP-2 and MMP-9) from the circulation via scavenger receptors on the phagocytes.

Capitol Hill, in addition to being a metonym for the United States Congress, is the largest historic residential neighborhood in Washington, D.C., stretching easterly in front of the United States Capitol along wide avenues. It is one of the oldest residential neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. and, with roughly 35,000 people in just under , it is also one of the most densely populated. As a geographic feature, Capitol Hill rises near the center of the District of Columbia and extends eastward. Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant, as he began to develop his plan for the new federal capital city in 1791, chose to locate the \\"Congress House\\" (the Capitol building) on the crest of the hill at a site that he characterized as a \\"pedestal waiting for a monument\\". The Capitol building has been the home of the Congress of the United States and the workplace of many residents of the Capitol Hill neighborhood since 1800. The Capitol Hill neighborhood today straddles two quadrants of the city, Southeast and Northeast. A large portion of the neighborhood is now designated as the Capitol Hill Historic District. The name Capitol Hill is often used to refer to both the historic district and to the larger neighborhood around it. To the east of Capitol Hill lies the Anacostia River, to the north is the H Street corridor, to the south are the Southeast/Southwest Freeway and the Washington Navy Yard, and to the west are the National Mall and the city's central business district. The Capitol building is surrounded by the Capitol Hill Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The Capitol Hill Historic District was expanded in 2015 to the north to include the blocks bordered by 2nd Street, F Street, 4th Street, and just south of H Street, NE, collectively known as the Swampoodle Addition. History  L'Enfant selected the location of the Capitol (the \\"Congress House\\") in his 1791 design for the federal capital city (see: L'Enfant Plan). He referred to the hill chosen as the site of the future Congress House as \\"Jenkins Hill\\" or \\"Jenkins Heights\\".(1) (2) However, the tract of land had for many years belonged to the Carroll family and was noted in their records of ownership as \\"New Troy\\". While a man named Thomas Jenkins had once pastured some livestock at the site of the Capitol (and thus his name was associated with the site), artist John Trumbull, who would paint several murals inside the Capitol's rotunda, reported in 1791 that the site was covered with a thick wood, making it an unlikely place for livestock to graze. Research published in 2004 by the Capitol Hill Historical Society showed that Jenkins' land was just seven blocks east of the site of the Capitol and that L'Enfant was likely to have given Jenkins' name to the general location. While serving in 1793 as President George Washington's Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson named Capitol Hill, invoking the famous Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill, one of the seven hills of Rome.(1) (2) However, the connection between the two is not completely clear. (The Roman Senate had in fact never met on the Capitoline Hill). The neighborhood that is now called Capitol Hill started to develop when the government began work at two locations, the Capitol and the Washington Navy Yard. It became a distinct community between 1799 and 1810 as the federal government became a major employer. The first stage in its early history was that of a boarding house community developed for members of Congress. In the early years of the Republic, few Congressmen wished to establish permanent residence in the city. Instead, most preferred to live in boarding houses within walking distance of the Capitol. In 1799, the Washington Navy Yard was established on the banks of the Anacostia River, providing jobs to craftsmen who built and repaired ships. Many of the craftsmen who were employed both at the Navy Yard and in the construction of the Capitol chose to live within walking distance, to the east of the Capitol and the north of the Navy Yard. They became the original residential population of the neighborhood. In 1801, Thomas Jefferson, who was at the time President of the United States, selected the location of the Marine Barracks, which had to be within marching distance of both the Capitol and the White House, near the Washington Navy Yard. By 1810, shops, goldsmiths, blacksmiths, and churches were flourishing in the area. The Civil War resulted in more construction in the Capitol Hill area, including the building of hospitals. Construction of new houses continued in the 1870s and 1880s. The neighborhood began to divide along racial and economic class lines. Electricity, piped water, and plumbing were introduced in the 1890s, and were first available in the downtown areas of the District of Columbia, including Capitol Hill. There was a real estate development boom between 1890 and 1910 as the Capitol Hill area became one of the first neighborhoods having these modern conveniences. In 1976, the Capitol Hill Historic District was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is one of the largest historic districts in the United States. The boundaries of the historic district are irregular, extending southward from F Street NE, as far east as 14th Street, as far west as South Capitol Street, and with a southern limit marked chiefly by Virginia Avenue but including some territory as far south as M Street SE. It includes buildings from the Federal period (1800 to 1820) through 1919, but most of the buildings are late Victorian. Capitol Hill has remained a fairly stable middle-class neighborhood throughout its existence. It suffered a period of economic decline and rising crime in the mid-20th century but gradually recovered. During the so-called \\"crack epidemic\\" of the 1980s, its fringes were often affected. Beginning in the 1990s, the neighborhood has undergone intense gentrification. Description Christ Church built 1806 on G Street SE Capitol Hill's landmarks include not only the United States Capitol, but also the Senate and House office buildings, the Supreme Court building, the Library of Congress, the Marine Barracks, the Washington Navy Yard, and Congressional Cemetery. It is, however, largely a residential neighborhood composed predominantly of rowhouses of different stylistic varieties and periods. Side by side exist early 19th century manor houses, Federal townhouses, small frame dwellings, ornate Italianate bracketed houses, and the late 19th century press brick rowhouses with their often whimsical decorative elements combining Richardsonian Romanesque, Queen Anne, and Eastlakian motifs. In the 1990s, gentrification and the booming economy of the District of Columbia meant that the neighborhood's non-historic and obsolete buildings began to be replaced. New buildings, which have to comply with height limits and other restrictions, are often done in a decorative modernist style, many by Amy Weinstein, whose designs feature polychrome brickwork set in patterned relief. There are multiple schools within the boundaries, including Brent Elementary School, the main primary school, St. Peter's School on Capitol Hill, the only Catholic school, Capitol Hill Day School, Stuart- Hobson Middle School, Elliot-Hine Jr. High School, Eastern High School and many others. Compared to other DC neighborhoods, it has an abnormally large number of schools. The main non-residential corridor of Capitol Hill is Pennsylvania Avenue, a lively commercial street with shops, restaurants and bars. Eastern Market is an 1873 public market on 7th Street SE, where vendors sell fresh meat and produce in indoor stalls and at outdoor farmers' stands. It is also the site of an outdoor flea market every weekend. After a major fire gutted the main market building on April 30, 2007, it underwent restoration and reopened on June 26, 2009. One of the most beloved stores, Fragers Hardware, has been based on Pennsylvania Avenue for nearly 100 years before it suffered a fire similar in destructiveness to the Eastern Market fire. It has successfully rebuilt on the same location. Barracks Row (8th Street SE), so called because of its proximity to the U.S. Marine Barracks, is one of the city's oldest commercial corridors. It dates to the late 18th century and has recently been revitalized. A new addition to Capitol Hill is a community center named Hill Center. Hill Center is housed in the restored Old Naval Hospital at the corner of 9th and Pennsylvania Avenue SE. The rehabilitation of the Old Naval Hospital combines the restoration of a historically significant landmark with the cutting-edge technologies of modern ‚Äúgreen‚Äù architecture. Hill Center is a vibrant new home for cultural, educational, and civic life on Capitol Hill. Recent estimates in Capitol Hill newspapers suggest as many as a third of all Members of Congress live on Capitol Hill while in Washington, due to its proximity to key government buildings.

Lane gave his last performance at the age of 101 as a narrator in 2006. Lane appeared in many Frank Capra films, including Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), You Can't Take It With You (1938), Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), Arsenic and Old Lace (1944), It's a Wonderful Life (1946) and Riding High (1950). He was a favored supporting actor of Lucille Ball, who often used him as a no-nonsense authority figure and comedic foe of her scatterbrained TV character on her TV series I Love Lucy, The Lucy‚ÄìDesi Comedy Hour and The Lucy Show. His first film of more than 250 was as a hotel clerk in Smart Money (1931) starring Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney. Early life Lane was born Charles Gerstle Levison to a Jewish family in San Francisco, California, to parents Alice (n√©e Gerstle) and Jacob B. Levison. His father, an executive at the Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, was instrumental in rebuilding San Francisco after the 1906 earthquakeJWeekly: \\"Celebrity Jews\\" by Nate Bloom. July 20, 2007 of which Lane was one of the last remaining survivors. Career Lane spent a short time as an insurance salesman before taking to the stage at the Pasadena Playhouse. Actor/director Irving Pichel first suggested that Lane go into acting in 1929, and four years later Lane was a founding member of the Screen Actors Guild. He became a favorite of director Frank Capra, who used him in several films. In It's a Wonderful Life, Lane played a seemingly hard-nosed rent collector. Lane also appeared in the film Mighty Joe Young (1949) as one of the reporters cajoling Max O'Hara (Robert Armstrong) for information about the identity of \\"Mr. Joseph Young\\", the persona given featured billing on the front of the building, on opening night. Among his many roles as a character actor, Lane played Mr. Fosdick in Dear Phoebe, which aired on NBC in 1954‚Äì1955. He also portrayed mean-spirited railroad executive Homer Bedloe in the situation comedy Petticoat Junction. He guest starred on such series as ABC's Guestward, Ho!, starring Joanne Dru, and The Bing Crosby Show, as well as the syndicated drama of the American Civil War, The Gray Ghost. He was a good friend of Lucille Ball, and his specialty in playing scowling, beady-eyed, short tempered, no-nonsense professionals provided the perfect comic foil for Ball's scatterbrained television character. He played several guest roles on I Love Lucy, including an appearance in the episode \\"Lucy Goes To the Hospital\\", where he is seated in the waiting room with Ricky while Lucy gives birth to their son. He also played the title role in the episode \\"The Business Manager\\", the casting director in \\"Lucy Tells The Truth,\\" and the passport clerk in \\"Staten Island Ferry.\\" Lane appeared twice in The Lucy‚ÄìDesi Comedy Hour. He later had recurring roles as shopkeeper Mr. Finch on Dennis the Menace and during the first season (1962‚Äì1963) of Ball's The Lucy Show, playing banker Mr. Barnsdahl. According to The Lucy Book by Geoffrey Fidelman, Lane was let go because he had trouble reciting his lines correctly. However, Lane was in reality a placeholder for Ball's original choice, Gale Gordon, who joined the program in 1963 as Mr. Mooney after he was free from other contractual obligations. In 1963, Lane appeared in the mega-comedy It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, playing the airport manager. (On the DVD commentary track, historian Michael Schlesinger wryly noted, \\"You do not have a comedy unless Charles Lane is in it.\\") His final acting role was at the age of 101 in 2006's The Night Before Christmas. His last television appearance was at the age of 90, when he appeared in the 1995 Disney TV remake of its 1970 teen comedy The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes, with Kirk Cameron. In 2005, the TV Land Awards paid tribute to Lane by celebrating his 100th birthday. Seated in a wheelchair in the audience, which had sung Happy Birthday to him, Lane was presented with his award by Haley Joel Osment and then announced \\"If you're interested, I'm still available [for work]!\\" The audience gave him a standing ovation. Lane appeared in more than 250 films and hundreds of television shows and was uncredited in many of them. On his busiest days, Lane said he sometimes played more than one role, getting into costume and filming his two or three lines, then hurrying off to another set or studio for a different costume and a different role. As for being typecast, Lane described it as \\"... a pain in the ass. You did something that was pretty good, and the picture was pretty good. But that pedigreed you into that type of part, which I thought was stupid and unfair, too. It didn't give me a chance, but it made the casting easier for the studio.\\" Lane is recorded as having appeared in sixty-seven parts in a span of just two years, 1940 to 1942. Personal life In 1931, Lane married Ruth Covell (1906-2002) and they remained together for 70 years until her death in 2002. They had a son named Tom and a daughter named Alice. Despite his stern, hard-hearted demeanor in most of his film and television roles, friends and acquaintances have unanimously described Lane as a warm, funny and kind person. On January 26, 2007, Lane celebrated his 102nd birthday. He continued to live in the Brentwood home he bought with Ruth (for $46,000 in 1964) until his death. In the end, his son, Tom Lane, said he was talking with his father at 9 p.m. on the evening of Monday, July 9, 2007, \\"He was lying in bed with his eyes real wide open. Then he closed his eyes and stopped breathing.\\" Charles Lane was 102. He died from natural causes.

Located near the southern fringe of the Cotswolds, the Cotswold Way long-distance footpath passes through the town. Standing on the B4058, Wotton is about from the M5 motorway. The nearest railway station is Cam and Dursley, away by road, on the Bristol to Birmingham line. History The first record of the town is in an Anglo-Saxon Royal Charter of King Edmund I, who in AD 940 leased four hides of land in Wudetun to Eadric. The name Wudetun means the enclosure, homestead or village (tun) in or near the wood (wude). The \\"Edge\\" refers to the limestone escarpment of the Cotswold Edge which includes the hills of Wotton Hill and Tor Hill that flank the town. In the 1086 Domesday Book listing, Wotton was in the hundred of Dudstone.http://opendomesday.org/place/SO8520/wotton/ Open Domesday: Wotton Kingswood Abbey was founded in 1139, but all that remains is a 16th-century Cistercian gatehouse. Nearby historical buildings include the Tudor houses of Newark Park and Owlpen Manor. The medieval former public house The Ancient Ram Inn dates back to 1145. The original town was burnt down during the reign of King John (1199-1216); it was rebuilt in 1252 and a charter granted to Johanna de Berkeley authorising her to hold a market and a three-day annual fair on the Feast of the Cross. In 1272 the inhabitants of the borough were authorised to elect one of their members as a Mayor, a practice that continued every year until 1886. St. Mary the Virgin was consecrated in 1283, and is the oldest and largest church in the town. The Katharine Lady Berkeley's Grammar School was established in 1384 and is now a comprehensive named Katharine Lady Berkeley's School although the present modern building is a little outside of the town on the way to the village of Kingswood. The British School was established in the village in 1835. A battle occurred near the Ancient Ram Inn in 1469, when the building was owned by a Viscount Lisle. William Berkely led the forces that beat the Viscount, and after the battle his men sacked the manor. Overlooking the town on the top of Wotton Hill are a collection of trees planted in the 19th century to commemorate the Battle of Waterloo. These are situated on the site that housed one of the early warning beacons used to warn England of the approach of the Spanish Armada in 1588. A map of Wotton-under-Edge from 1946 New Mills, founded in 1810, prospered by supplying both sides in the Napoleonic wars but after a century of decline the mill was near to closing in 1981 when it was acquired by Renishaw plc. The town's corporation status was abolished in 1886 following the Municipal Corporations Act of 1883 The Wotton- under-Edge BT Tower formed part of the microwave communication network. Governance An electoral ward with the same name exists. The ward mainly covers Wotton-under-Edge but also stretches to North Nibley. The total population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 6,510. Facilities The town is relatively well served for a town of its size. It has several pubs and a hotel, and a range of takeaways and restaurants. It can be quite lively at night compared to many others of its size. It has several active social groups, such as Scouts,https://www.wottonscoutgroup.org/ Guides, a gardening club and the Wotton Lions. In 1958, local people and school students built the town swimming pool, which was completed in 1961. Subsequently the pool has had solar and electric heating installed. In 1999 with the fund raising support of community groups, a retractable enclosure was fitted to prolong the swimming season. In 2002, following the closure of the local cinema, a group of volunteers raised funds for a refurbishment to become one of the first digital cinemas in the UK. It re-opened in 2005 as a 100-seat facility inside an old stable yard, once part of the Crown Inn which closed in 1911. Films were first shown in the old Banqueting Hall of the Inn and moved to the stable yard some years later, due to the popularity of films. The Wotton Electric Picture House (the original name) is now a thriving venue. The town has always lacked a railway station. There was once one at nearby Charfield, which is still on a partly-extant line, and there have been calls for the station to be re-opened.

Before going into broadcasting, Garroway worked as a Harvard University lab assistant, as a book salesman, and as a piston ring salesman. After not being able to successfully sell either, Garroway decided to try his hand in radio. Career =Early years= Garroway began his broadcasting career at NBC as a page in 1938, he graduated 23rd in a class of 24 from NBC's school for announcers. Following graduation, he landed a job at Pittsburgh radio station KDKA in 1939. As a station reporter, he filed reports from a hot-air balloon, a U.S. Navy submarine in the Ohio River, and deep inside a coal mine. His early reporting efforts earned Garroway a reputation for finding a good story, even in unusual places. The \\"Roving Announcer\\", as he was known, worked his way up to become the station's special events director, while still attending to his on-air work. After two years with KDKA, Garroway left for Chicago. =Radio= Garroway at Chicago's WMAQ in 1951 with Connie Russell and Jack Haskell When the United States entered World War II in 1941, Garroway enlisted in the U.S. Navy. While stationed in Honolulu, he hosted a radio show when he was off duty, playing jazz records and reminiscing about the old days back in Chicago. After the war, Garroway went to work as a disc jockey at WMAQ (AM) in Chicago. Over time, Garroway hosted a series of radio programs such as The 11:60 Club, The Dave Garroway Show, and Reserved for Garroway. One oddity Garroway introduced on his radio shows was having the studio audience respond to a song number not by applauding but by snapping their fingers. Garroway also worked to organize jazz concerts, creating a \\"Jazz Circuit\\" of local clubs in 1947, bringing back interest in this music genre. His fellow disc jockeys voted him the nation's best in the 1948 and 1949 Billboard polls. He won the award again in 1951. Garroway was the first \\"communicator\\" on NBC Radio's Monitor when the program first aired on June 12, 1955. He continued as the Sunday evening host of the news and music program from 1955 to 1961. Garroway worked on the air at WCBS radio in 1964 and briefly hosted the afternoon rush hour shift at KFI in Los Angeles in late 1970 and early 1971. =Television= Garroway's signature upraised hand while saying \\"Peace\\" Garroway and crew on the Today show set (1952) Garroway as host of Wide Wide World (1957) Garroway was introduced to the national television audience when he hosted the experimental musical variety show Garroway at Large, telecast live from Chicago. It was carried by NBC from June 18, 1949, to June 24, 1951.Video file downloads-The Best of Garroway at Large Garroway's relaxed, informal style when on the air became part of his trademark. In 1960, reviewer Richard F. Shepard of The New York Times wrote, \\"He does not crash into the home with the false jollity and thunderous witticisms of a backslapper. He is pleasant, serious, scholarly looking and not obtrusively convivial.\\" On television, Garroway was known for his signoff, saying \\"Peace\\" with an upraised palm. Along with Arthur Godfrey, Arlene Francis, Steve Allen and Jack Paar, Garroway was one of the pioneers of the television talk show. Television commentator Steven D. Stark traces the origins of the style to Chicago. Garroway, Studs Terkel, and Hugh Downs all hosted relaxed, garrulous, extemporaneous shows in that city in the early 1950s. Earlier radio and television voices spoke with an authoritative \\"announcer's\\" intonation, resembling public oration, often dropping about a musical fifth on the last word of a sentence. Garroway was one of the broadcasters who introduced conversational style and tone to television, beginning some broadcasts as though the viewer were sitting in the studio with him, as in this November 20, 1957, introduction for the Today show: \\"And how are you about the world today? Let's see what kind of shape it's in; there is a glimmer of hope.\\" Pioneering NBC president Sylvester \\"Pat\\" Weaver chose Garroway as the host of his new morning news-and-entertainment experiment, the Today show, in 1951. He was joined by news editor Jim Fleming and announcer Jack Lescoulie when the show debuted on Monday, January 14, 1952. Though initially panned by critics, Garroway's style attracted a large audience that enjoyed his easygoing presence early in the morning. His familiar \\"cohost,\\" a chimpanzee with the puckish name of J. Fred Muggs, did not hurt his genial manner, but his concurrent seriousness in dealing with news stories and ability to clearly explain abstract concepts earned him the nickname \\"The Communicator\\" and eventually won praise from critics and viewers alike. At the same time he did Today, Garroway also hosted a Friday night variety series, The Dave Garroway Show, from October 2, 1953, to June 25, 1954. On October 16, 1955, he began hosting NBC's live Sunday afternoon documentary Wide Wide World, continuing with that series until June 8, 1958. Another Friday evening variety show, Dave's Place, was on the air in 1960. He also hosted a radio show, Dial Dave Garroway, that went on the air as soon as Today wrapped up each morning. Dial Dave Garroway had begun in 1946 when Garroway was still working for WMAQ in Chicago. Garroway took Today to various locations during his tenure: Paris in 1959 and Rome in 1960; car shows and technology expos; plays and movies; and aboard an Air Force B-52 for a practice bombing run. Through television, Garroway gave viewers access to a variety of people that included politicians, writers, artists, scientists, economists, and musicians. In his role as Today host, Garroway acted as pitchman for several of the show's sponsors. Among them were Admiral television sets, Alcoa and Sergeant's dog food. Most of the appearances were in the form of print ads in newspapers and magazines. By 1960, there was also a board game called \\"Dave Garroway's Today Game\\". In 1961, Garroway hosted a special filmed program for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association that traced Billy Graham's crusades from 1949 to 1960. Garroway's relaxed demeanor on TV hid his depression. Toward the end of his professional career, he began to have disagreements with staff members; some days Garroway would disappear in the middle of the Today broadcast, leaving colleagues to finish the live program. When Garroway's second wife, Pamela, died of a prescription drug overdose on April 28, 1961, Garroway sank into a deeper emotional malaise. In late May 1961, Garroway resigned, announcing his intention to leave Today‚Äîeither at the end of October when his contract was finished or sooner, if possible‚Äîin order to spend more time with his children. On June 16, 1961, Garroway left the morning show he helped pioneer. =Later career= After leaving Today, Garroway returned to television on National Educational Television (the forerunner of PBS) with a science series called Exploring the Universe in late 1962. Later he went back to working in radio, doing \\"split shift\\" shows called Garroway AM (mid mornings) and Garroway PM (mid afternoons) for WCBS (AM), New York. Garroway also started a magazine, National FM-Radio; the venture was a costly failure with Garroway realizing he was not cut out to be a businessman. While he was in the publishing business, Garroway began reading various law books in an effort to try to understand what his lawyer was saying. His attorney told him that he had done enough legal reading to pass the New York State bar exam. On a bet, Garroway sat for and passed the written exam. In April 1969, Garroway launched a daytime talk show on WNAC-TV, Tempo Boston, which he hoped would be picked up for national syndication. Stations in New York and Philadelphia agreed to pick up the show, but by early 1970, the small-scale syndication ended and Tempo was cancelled. The show had promise, but management instead decided to fill its time slot with old movies instead of more expensive local programming. After leaving the Boston airwaves, Garroway traveled to southern California, hosting a music-and-talk show on KFI radio in Los Angeles. He planned to reenter the television world with a CBS summer replacement show, Newcomers, but the show never made it past the summer of 1971. While in Los Angeles, Garroway began to take acting workshops; he had a role in an episode of the western series Alias Smith and Jones as a judge in 1972. Garroway appeared sporadically on other television programs without achieving the success and recognition levels he enjoyed on Today. He largely remained out of the public eye for the rest of the 1960s and 1970s, although he did reemerge for Today anniversaries. His final such appearance was on the 30th anniversary show, on January 14, 1982. =Other media= Garroway narrated a compilation of romantic songs performed by the Boston Pops Orchestra, Getting Friendly with Music, in 1956. He also served as narrator for special albums, including 1964's The Great Campaigners, 1928‚Äì1960 and 1960's Names From the Wars. In 1960, Garroway wrote Fun on Wheels, an activity book for children on road trips. The book was revised and reissued in 1962 and 1964. Toward the end of his life, Garroway planned to write an autobiography. The book never made it past the research stage; the surviving notes, manuscripts, audio tapes, and news clippings were sent to former Today researcher Lee Lawrence. Upon Lawrence's death in 2003, the boxes were turned over to the Library of American Broadcasting, Special Collections, University of Maryland Libraries, where they remained as of 2009. Personal life The Garroways at home in 1960. From left: Garroway with David, Jr., wife Pamela, daughter Paris and son Michael seated on the floor =Marriages and children= Garroway was married three times and had three children. His first marriage was to Adele Dwyer, whom he married in 1945. The couple had a daughter, Paris, before divorcing the following year. He married former actress and ballerina Pamela Wilde in 1956. They had a son, David Cunningham Garroway, Jr., in 1958. Garroway later adopted Wilde's son Michael from her first marriage. Wilde died of a prescription drug overdose on April 28, 1961. Garroway married astronomer Sarah Lee Lippincott in February 1980. They remained married until Garroway's death in 1982. =Interests= Garroway at the wheel of his favorite car, a 1938 SS Jaguar 100 which he restored Garroway was very interested in astronomy, and during a tour of Russian telescopes he met his third wife, astronomer Sarah Lee Lippincott. In his final years, he attended astronomy symposia at Swarthmore College and spent time at Sproul Observatory. Garroway was also an automobile enthusiast, and one of his hobbies was collecting and restoring vintage luxury and sports cars. He was especially fond of his 1938 SS Jaguar 100, which he also raced in his spare time. (PDF) Garroway was featured in several automobile commercials, including the first Chevrolet Corvette in 1953, and the Ford Falcon in 1964. Garroway, a music lover and amateur drummer, lent his name to a series of recordings of jazz, classical, and pop music released in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Among them were Wide, Wide World of Jazz, 1957's Some of My Favorites and 1958's Dave Garroway's Orchestra: An Adventure in Hi-Fi Music. Death In 1981, Garroway underwent open-heart surgery, as a result of which he contracted a staph infection. On January 14, 1982, Today broadcast its 30th anniversary special, which featured all of the important living, former, and current staff members. Garroway, who had recently undergone rehab for an amphetamine addiction, appeared to be cheerful and in good spirits during the show. He also indicated that he would be present for the show's 35th anniversary in 1987. A few months later, however, Garroway began suffering complications from the infection he had contracted during surgery. He spent some weeks in and out of hospitals and had an in-home nurse tending to him. On July 21, he was found dead of a self- inflicted shotgun wound at his Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, home. There was no suicide note and Garroway's nurse did not recall him being unusually depressed in the final day of his life. Garroway's son Michael said that his father had been experiencing complications from his heart operation and he had \\"unfortunately succumbed to the traumatic effects of his illness.\\" In addition, he was extremely depressed at his inability to resurrect a TV career, saying to friends and family \\"I'm old hat, old news. Nobody wants old Dave anymore.\\" His family held a private graveside service for him in Philadelphia on July 28. Garroway is buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. The July 22 edition of Today was mainly a remembrance of Garroway. His colleague Jack Lescoulie, news editor Frank Blair, and former consumer reporter Betty Furness offered tributes on the show.NBC News Today rundown, July 22, 1982 Garroway's death was noted on NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw and Roger Mudd.

The dukedoms were named after Cleveland in northern England. The first creation in 1670 (along with the barony of Nonsuch and the earldom of Southampton) was for Barbara Castlemaine, a mistress of King Charles II. The dukedom was created with a special remainder allowing it to be inherited by her first son, Charles FitzRoy, and his heirs male, then by her third son, George FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Northumberland, both being her illegitimate sons by Charles II. Charles FitzRoy was created Duke of Southampton in 1675 and inherited the dukedom of Cleveland in 1709. His son William inherited both dukedoms in 1730. He died without heirs male in 1774. As there were no heirs male descended from George FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Northumberland and the 1st Duchess of Cleveland's 2nd son (Henry Fitzroy, 1st Duke of Grafton) and his heirs male had not been made eligible to inherit the dukedom of Cleveland, the title became extinct. The dukedom of Cleveland was created again on 29 January 1833 for William Vane, 3rd Earl of Darlington, along with the title Baron Raby.

It is part of the North Maluku province of Indonesia and Sofifi, the capital of the province, is located on the west coast of the island. Halmahera has a land area of ; it is the largest island of Indonesia outside the five main islands. It had a population of 162,728 in 1995; by 2010, it had increased to 449,938 for the island itself (excluding the tip which is considered part of the Joronga Islands, but including Gebe and Ju islands) and 667,161 for the island group (including all of South Halmahera and Tidore, but not Ternate). Approximately half of the island's inhabitants are Muslim and half are Christian. History Togutil man of Halmahera island Sparsely-populated Halmahera's fortunes have long been closely tied to those of the smaller islands of Ternate and Tidore, both off its west coast. These islands were both the sites of major kingdoms in the era before Dutch East India Company colonized the entire archipelago. During World War II, Halmahera was the site of a Japanese naval base at Kao Bay. In 1999 and 2000 Halmahera was the site of violence that began as a purely ethnic dispute between residents of (mainly Christian) Kao and (entirely Muslim) Malifut sub- districts and then took on a religious nature as it spread through much of the North Moluccas, called the Maluku sectarian conflict. Thousands of people on Halmahera were killed in the fighting between religious militias. In June 2000, about five hundred people were killed when a ferry carrying refugees from the fighting on Halmahera sank off the northeast tip of Sulawesi island. Conspiracy theories about this event abound. A memorial to this tragedy can be found in Duma village in North Halmahera district. Today, much transportation to the rest of Indonesia is through connections on the provincial capital, Ternate island although Tobelo, the largest town on Halmahera, also has direct ferry and cargo sea links to Surabaya and Manado. Particularly since the inauguration of the first ever directly elected Bupati (Regent or District Head), Tobelo is undergoing rapid development and is aiming at rivaling Ternate's historical dominance. As it is surrounded by flat land, Tobelo has the potential for expansion. Ternate is limited by its size, being a small island which can be driven around in forty-five minutes. Also, in 2010 the provincial government has moved the provincial capital from Ternate City to Sofifi, a small village on the Halmahera coast opposite Tidore island. North Maluku Province consists of eight regencies and two municipalities (cities); five of the regencies and one municipality include a part of Halmahera island. The regencies are North Halmahera, West Halmahera, East Halmahera, Central Halmahera, South Halmahera, Morotai, Sula Islands and Taliabu, while the municipalities are Ternate and Tidore Islands. Only Ternate Municipality, and Morotai, the Sula Islands and Taliabu regencies do not include any part of Halmahera. Geology Topography of Halmahera The volcanic island lies on an island arc that includes the Raja Ampat Islands, all uplifted by the northward migration of the continent of Australia and subduction of the Pacific Plate. Dukono is an active volcano at the north end of the island. Mount Ibu is an active volcano on the island's northwest coast. Natural history Semioptera wallacei by Richard Bowdler Sharpe (1847-1909) The flightless invisible rail is endemic to the island. The naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace visited Halmahera, as described in his 1869 book The Malay Archipelago. He considered the standardwing bird of paradise, Semioptera wallacei, to be his greatest prize. It was in February 1858, on island of Ternate, between the bouts of fever, that a suffering Wallace came to the idea of the natural selection via the survival of the fittest. Wallace wrote his ideas during the next couple of days, and sent the historical letter to Darwin. Mining A rig crew looking for minerals Halmahera is the site of several mining projects.

It became extinct on the death of his grandson in 1694. Owing to the uncanonicity of the marriage of Robert II to Elizabeth Mure, and the 1373 Act which only sidestepped this question for heirs male of Robert II's sons, William Graham's ancestors potentially had a better claim to the Scottish throne than Mary, Queen of Scots. Graham thus had a potentially better claim to the throne than Mary's descendant, Charles I, as Graham's claim descends from Robert II's second - undoubted - marriage. Graham had successfully petitioned for the return of the title of Earl of Strathearn which the first Graham Earl of Mentieth had held. Before he was invested, however, Graham boasted that his blood was \\"bluer than the King's\\". He was sacked from his positions and instead of receiving the Earldom of Strathearn, he was given the insultingly minor title of Earl of Airth.

In 1834 Capt Robert Barclay Allardice of Ury and Allardice petitioned the King to be recognised as Earl of Airth as a descendant of William Graham, 1st Earl of Airth, his great-great-great- grandfather, basing his claim on the fact that the Letters Patent of 1633 specified descent to 'heirs general', rather than limiting it to 'heirs male'. The petition was referred to the House of Lords. No decision was forthcoming and in 1840 Capt Barclay Allardice petitioned Queen Victoria for him to be recognised as Earl of Strathearn, Menteith and Airth. Capt Barclay Allardice died in 1854 and his elder daughter, Mary Barclay Allardice, renewed the claim in 1870. The Committee for Privileges heard evidence in support of the opposing claims in 1870 and 1871, but came to no decision, and the three Earldoms remained dormant. On 29 April 2011, Queen Elizabeth II conferred the title of Earl of Strathearn on Prince William of Wales. As a result, on marriage his wife Catherine became Countess of Strathearn. He generally uses this title in Scotland.

Common fixtures =Supply= The most common plumbing fixtures are: *Bathtubs *Bidets *Channel drains *Drinking fountains *Hose bib (connections for water hoses) *Janitor sinks *Kitchen sinks *Showers *Pipes *Tapware - an industry term for that sub- category of plumbing fixtures consisting of tap valves, also called water taps (British English) or faucets (American English), and their accessories, such as water spouts and shower heads. *Terminal valves for dishwashers, ice makers, humidifiers, etc. *Urinals *Utility sinks *Flush toilets =Waste= A water outlet Each of these plumbing fixtures has one or more water outlets and a drain. In some cases, the drain has a device that can be manipulated to block the drain to fill the basin of the fixture. Each fixture also has a flood rim, or level at which water will begin to overflow. Most fixtures also have an overflow, which is a conduit for water to drain away, when the regular drain is plugged, before the water actually overflows at the flood rim level. However, water closets and showers (that are not in bathtubs) usually lack this feature because their drains normally cannot be stopped. Each fixture usually has a characteristic means of connection. Normal plumbing practice is to install a valve on each water supply line before the fixture, and this is most commonly termed a stop or \\"service valve\\". The water supply to some fixtures is cold water only (such as water closets and urinals). Most fixtures also have a hot water supply. In some occasional cases, a sink may have both a potable (drinkable) and a non-potable water supply. Lavatories and water closets normally connect to the water supply by means of a supply, which is a tube, usually of nominal 3/8 in (U.S.) or 10 or 12 mm diameter (Europe and Middle East), which connects the water supply to the fixture, sometimes through a flexible (braided) hose. For water closets, this tube usually ends in a flat neoprene washer that tightens against the connection, while for lavatories, the supply usually ends in a conical neoprene washer. Kitchen sinks, tubs and showers usually have supply tubes built onto their valves which then are soldered or 'fast jointed' directly onto the water supply pipes. Drains The actual initial drain part in a lavatory or sink is termed a strainer. If there is a removable strainer device that fits into the fixed strainer, it is termed a strainer basket. The initial pipe that leads from the strainer to the trap is termed the tailpiece. Floor-mounted water closets seal to the toilet flange of the drain pipe by means of a wax ring. These are traditionally made out of beeswax. However, their proper sealing depends on proper seating of the water closet, on a firm and secure base (floor), and on proper installation of the closet bolts which secure the closet to the flange, which is in turn supposed to be securely fastened to the floor. Traps and vents This drain cover has a container underneath (which can be taken out for cleaning and revealing another container below) acting as a trap. Water inside the container forms a seal when the cover is in place. Positive air pressure will push the cover up, acting as an early warning device. The underside of the cover (centre image) is kept moist by condensation occurring and insects that go back up the drain pipe get stuck to the walls of the cover. All plumbing fixtures have traps in their drains; these traps are either internal or external to the fixtures. Traps are pipes which curve down then back up; they 'trap' a small amount of water to create a water seal between the ambient air space and the inside of the drain system. This prevents sewer gas from entering buildings. Most water closets, bidets, and many urinals have the trap integral with the fixture itself. The visible water surface in a toilet is the top of the trap's water seal. Each fixture drain, with exceptions, must be vented so that negative air pressure in the drain cannot siphon the trap dry, to prevent positive air pressure in the sewer from forcing gases past the water seal, and to prevent explosive sewer gas buildup. Electronic plumbing Sensor operated plumbing fixtures have fewer moving parts, and therefore outlast traditional manual flush fixtures. Additionally, they reduce water consumption by way of intelligent flushing schedules (fuzzy logic) that determines the quantity of each flush based on how many people are standing in line to use the fixture. A wall-mounted shower sensor In public facilities, the trend is toward sensor-operated (automatic) fixtures that improve hygiene and save money. For example, sensor operated automatic-flush urinals have fewer moving parts, reduce wear, and tend to last longer than manual-flush valves. Also they ensure fixtures are flushed only once per use. Some contain intelligence that flushes them at different amounts of water flow depending on traffic patterns: e.g., the fixture can detect a lineup of users and only give a full flush after the last person has used the urinal. For the same purpose, dual-flush toilets are also becoming more popular. A combination of both technologies can allow for saved power and water. Automatic flush compensates for users who do not bother to flush. Also, since the fixtures are always flushed, there is no need for a urinal cake, or other odor reduction. Sensor-operated toilets also have automatic flush. Sensor-operated faucets and showers save water. For example, while a user is lathering up with soap, the fixture shuts off and then resumes when the user needs it to. Sensor-operated soap and shampoo dispensers reduce waste and spills that might otherwise represent a slippage hazard. However, many people, especially children, dislike or even fear automatic flush toilets, since they have the tendency to flush without warning, even while the user is still sitting on the toilet. Some parents have started keeping track of public bathrooms that have manual flush toilets, or even carrying post-it notes or other devices with them to temporarily disable the automatic flush sensor. These fixtures typically cost more to install than conventional plumbing fixtures, because they require the services (or presence) of both a licensed plumber and a licensed electrician. Construction companies on cost-plus contracts may actually favor these fixtures for this reason, although their clients may not. The additional complexity of these fixtures also complicates repairs, particularly the diagnosis of malfunctions causing unexpected flushing. Few electricians, and fewer plumbers, understand microelectronics well enough for complex diagnosis.

Sir David Kirke (c. 1597 ‚Äì 1654), also spelt David Ker, was a Scottish adventurer, privateer and colonial governor. He is best known for his successful capture of New France in 1629 during the Thirty Years' War and his subsequent governorship of lands in Newfoundland. A favourite of Charles I of England, Kirke's downfall came with that of the Crown during the English Civil War and it is believed he died in prison. Early life Kirke was a son of Gervase (Jarvis) Kirke, a rich merchant of the City of London,Herald's Visitation of the City of London dated 1 December 1631 (British Museum Add. MS 5533) and Elizabeth Goudon, a French Huguenot woman. He was raised in Dieppe, in Normandy. Also David was the eldest of five sons, followed by Lewis, Thomas, John and James. Quebec campaign Champlain leaves Quebec as a prisoner aboard Kirke's ship, after a bloodless siege in 1629. Image by Charles William Jefferys, 1942 A English fleet, consisting of six warships and three pinnaces, left Gravesend in March 1629 with Jacques Michel, a deserter from Champlain, to act as pilot on the St. Lawrence River. Champlain sent a party from Quebec, whose residents were on the point of starvation, to meet an expected relief fleet under √âmery de Ca√´n. Unknown to Champlain, Ca√´n was also bringing word that in April peace had been declared in Europe by the Treaty of Susa. Although Champlain's party met Ca√´n in the Gulf, they were captured by the English on their way upriver to Quebec. Kirke, now aware of the desperate conditions facing the Quebecers, sent his brothers Lewis and Thomas to demand a French surrender. Having no alternative, Champlain surrendered on 19 July 1629. However, Champlain argued that the seizure of Quebec by the Kirkes was unlawful, as the war had already ended; and he worked to have the area returned to France. As part of the ongoing negotiations of their exit from the Anglo-French War, in 1632 Charles I of England agreed to return the lands in exchange for Louis XIII paying his wife's dowry. These terms were signed into law with the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye of 1632. The lands in Quebec and Acadia were returned to the French Company of One Hundred Associates. As a consolation, Kirke was knighted in 1633. Governor of Newfoundland Kirke is believed to have visited Ferryland, as he published a report on the island of Newfoundland in 1635. He was impressed by the island's fisheries, and in 1637 he asked King Charles for a land grant. In November 1637 Kirke and his partners were granted a royal charter for co-proprietorship of the entire island. A portion of Newfoundland, the Avalon Peninsula, had already been granted to George Calvert, Lord Baltimore, but he was accused of abandoning his colony before his death in 1632, and the lands were transferred to Kirke. The charter of this new grant had stipulations designed to reduce conflict with migratory fishermen; there was to be no settlement within six miles of the shore, fishing rooms were not to be occupied before the arrival of the summer fishing crews, and a five per cent tax was to be collected on all fish products taken by foreigners. Kirke was installed as the Proprietary Governor and arrived in 1638 with one hundred colonists. The original governorship of the Avalon Peninsula had passed to Baltimore's son, Cecilius Calvert, who had installed William Hill as governor. Kirke seized the governor's mansion, then occupied by Hill. In January 1638, the king also granted Kirke a coat of arms, \\"For the greater honour and splendour of that Countrey and the people therein inhabiting ‚Ä¶ to be used in all such cases as Armes are wont to be by other nations and Countries.\\" In 1639, Kirke renamed the colony the Pool Plantation. Over the next several years, he built forts at Ferryland, St. John‚Äôs, and Bay de Verde. He collected tolls from all fishing vessels. Kirke was granted the rights to \\"the sole trade of the Newfoundland, the Fishing excepted.\\" The latter words resulted in considerable trouble. At the time the Grand Banks of Newfoundland were being fished by many European nations, and Kirke's 5% tax gave an advantage to the English fishermen in the area. A number of West Country merchants thrived on the fish trade. Represented in London by Kirke, Barkeley, and Company, with several of his brothers in control, Kirke used his land rights to support the fish trade, in conflict with the terms of his charter. By 1638, strong links between Ferryland and Dartmouth, Devon, had already been established. Kirke brought the entire trade network south of St. John's under the control of a growing family commercial empire. These actions aroused strong animosity from the West Country merchants. The planters and migratory fishermen agreed that Kirke was reserving the best fishing rooms for himself and his friends. In addition, he was accused of opening taverns, which were disruptive to the settlers' work. But before these charges could be investigated, in 1642 the English Civil War broke out between the king and parliament. Arrest and death The Civil War ended in 1651, and the Kirkes, as royalists, were on the losing side. Although the merchants' complaints were put aside during the war, they were revived at the end of it, and the Kirkes were no longer protected by the crown. In 1651 a team of six commissioners, led by Maryland merchant John Treworgie, was sent to Ferryland to seize Kirke and bring him to England to stand trial. His lands were acquired by the Commonwealth of England. Found not guilty, in 1653 Kirke re-purchased the title to his lands. His wife, Dame Sara Kirke, returned to Newfoundland to oversee his business and reclaim his property, but Cecil Calvert, Lord Baltimore, brought new charges against Kirke over the title of the lands around Ferryland. Kirke is thought to have died in the original Southwark jail, The Clink, as early as January 1654, while awaiting trial. Treworgie was granted the governorship of Newfoundland in 1653; he was already in Ferryland, apparently never having left after 1651. The next year, he and two other commissioners were arrested by James Kirke for holding possession of lands rightfully owned by the Kirkes, and an unpaid debt of ¬£1,100. Treworgie maintained that Kirke's possessions had been returned to his wife, but was found guilty in a first trial. A personal plea to Cromwell resulted in a second trial. The outcome is lost, but it appears that Treworgie was found not guilty, as he continued to serve as governor until 1660. In 1660, Treworgie returned to England to ask for another term as governor and for six year's salary he claimed he was owed. He never returned to Newfoundland. Sara Kirke The restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660 re-opened the debate between the Kirkes and the Calverts over the ownership of the Avalon Peninsula. This time, Cecil Calvert was successful in gaining the royal patent on Avalon, but he never took up residence. David Kirke's brother, now Sir Lewis Kirke, demanded compensation for improvements made at Ferryland by the Kirkes. Lady Kirke petitioned Charles II to make Lewis's nephew George Kirke the governor of Newfoundland, an arrangement suggested by the Newfoundlanders, but the king demurred from appointing a resident governor. Lady Kirke and her children were still in Ferryland in 1673, when a Dutch fleet sacked and burned the settlement during the Third Anglo-Dutch War. A decade later, in 1683, Sir John Kirke, whose daughter had married Pierre-Esprit Radisson and who was himself a member of Prince Rupert‚Äôs Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company, asked the king for compensation for the losses incurred in the conquest of Canada in 1629. He claimed that the French had never paid the Kirkes for the return of the lands. The last known reference to his nephew George Kirke dates from 1680, when he was proposed as a collector of the toll levied on all boats fishing in Newfoundland waters. Dame Sara Kirke managed the Pool Plantation at Ferryland throughout this period. Between 1651 and her retirement in 1679, Sara and her sons developed a number of plantations at Ferryland and Renews. During raids by Dutch ships from New Amsterdam in 1665 and 1672 in the Anglo-Dutch Wars, their lands were targeted by the Dutch. As late as 1696, three of Sir David Kirke's sons, George, David the Younger, and Phillip, remained substantial planters on the Southern Shore of Newfoundland. The grant of arms to Kirke was lost during the Civil War. During the aftermath of World War I, the Imperial War Graves Commission in Europe asked what arms should mark the graves of soldiers from Newfoundland. During the subsequent investigations, the Kirke arms were found in the College of Heralds. In 1928, they were adopted as the official coat of arms of Newfoundland and continue to be used today by the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. width=\\"25%\\" align=\\"center\\"Preceded by: William Hill width=\\"25%\\" align=\\"center\\"Governor of Newfoundland 1638‚Äì1651 width=\\"25%\\" align=\\"center\\"Followed by: John Treworgie References External links Category:Governors of Newfoundland Colony Category:1590s births Category:1654 deaths Category:English people who died in prison custody Category:Persons of National Historic Significance (Canada) ","title":"David Kirke"},{"id":"555735","text":"Arms of Stratford, Earl of Aldborough: Barry of ten argent and azure, a lion rampant gules Earl of Aldborough, of the Palatinate of Upper Ormond, was a title in the Peerage of Ireland held by the Stratford family.

Thus, it occurs in the theory of the complex projective line, and in particular, in the theory of modular forms and hypergeometric functions. It plays an important role in the theory of univalent functions, conformal mapping and Teichm√ºller spaces. Definition The Schwarzian derivative of a holomorphic function of one complex variable is defined by : (Sf)(z) = \\\\left( \\\\frac{f(z)}{f'(z)}\\\\right)' - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left({f(z)\\\\over f'(z)}\\\\right)^2 = \\\\frac{f'(z)}{f'(z)}-\\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\left({f(z)\\\\over f'(z)}\\\\right)^2. The same formula also defines the Schwarzian derivative of a C3 function of one real variable. The alternative notation :\\\\\\\\{f,z\\\\\\\\} = (Sf)(z) is frequently used. Properties The Schwarzian derivative of any M√∂bius transformation : g(z) = \\\\frac{az + b}{cz + d} is zero. Conversely, the M√∂bius transformations are the only functions with this property. Thus, the Schwarzian derivative precisely measures the degree to which a function fails to be a M√∂bius transformation. If g is a M√∂bius transformation, then the composition g o f has the same Schwarzian derivative as f; and on the other hand, the Schwarzian derivative of f o g is given by the chain rule : (S(f \\\\circ g))(z) = (Sf)(g(z)) \\\\cdot g'(z)^2. More generally, for any sufficiently differentiable functions f and g : S(f \\\\circ g) = \\\\left( S(f)\\\\circ g\\\\right ) \\\\cdot(g')^2+S(g). This makes the Schwarzian derivative an important tool in one-dimensional dynamics Weisstein, Eric W. \\"Schwarzian Derivative.\\" From MathWorld‚ÄîA Wolfram Web Resource. since it implies that all iterates of a function with negative Schwarzian will also have negative Schwarzian. Introducing the function of two complex variables :F(z,w)= \\\\log \\\\left ( \\\\frac{f(z)-f(w)}{z-w} \\\\right ), its second mixed partial derivative is given by : \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 F(z,w)}{\\\\partial z \\\\, \\\\partial w} = {f^\\\\prime(z)f^\\\\prime(w)\\\\over(f(z)-f(w))^2}-{1\\\\over(z-w)^2}, and the Schwarzian derivative is given by the formula: : (Sf)(w)= \\\\left. 6 \\\\cdot {\\\\partial^2 F(z,w)\\\\over \\\\partial z \\\\, \\\\partial w}\\\\right\\\\vert_{z=w}. The Schwarzian derivative has a simple inversion formula, exchanging the dependent and the independent variables. One has :(Sw)(v) = -\\\\left(\\\\frac{dw}{dv}\\\\right)^2 (Sv)(w) which follows from the inverse function theorem, namely that v'(w)=1/w'. Differential equation The Schwarzian derivative has a fundamental relation with a second-order linear ordinary differential equation in the complex plane. Let f_1(z) and f_2(z) be two linearly independent holomorphic solutions of :\\\\frac{d^2f}{dz^2}+ Q(z) f(z)=0. Then the ratio g(z)=f_1(z)/f_2(z) satisfies :(Sg)(z) = 2Q(z) over the domain on which f_1(z) and f_2(z) are defined, and f_2(z) e 0. The converse is also true: if such a g exists, and it is holomorphic on a simply connected domain, then two solutions f_1 and f_2 can be found, and furthermore, these are unique up to a common scale factor. When a linear second-order ordinary differential equation can be brought into the above form, the resulting Q is sometimes called the Q-value of the equation. Note that the Gaussian hypergeometric differential equation can be brought into the above form, and thus pairs of solutions to the hypergeometric equation are related in this way. Conditions for univalence If f is a holomorphic function on the unit disc, D, then W. Kraus (1932) and Nehari (1949) proved that a necessary condition for f to be univalent is :S(f) \\\\le 6(1-z^2)^{-2}. Conversely if f(z) is a holomorphic function on D satisfying : S(f)(z) \\\\le 2(1-z^2)^{-2}, then Nehari proved that f is univalent. In particular a sufficient condition for univalence is : S(f)\\\\le 2. Conformal mapping of circular arc polygons The Schwarzian derivative and associated second -order ordinary differential equation can be used to determine the Riemann mapping between the upper half-plane or unit circle and any bounded polygon in the complex plane, the edges of which are circular arcs or straight lines. For polygons with straight edges, this reduces to the Schwarz‚ÄìChristoffel mapping, which can be derived directly without using the Schwarzian derivative. The accessory parameters that arise as constants of integration are related to the eigenvalues of the second-order differential equation. Already in 1890 Felix Klein had studied the case of quadrilaterals in terms of the Lam√© differential equation. Let Œî be a circular arc polygon with angles Œ±1, ..., Œ±n in clockwise order. Let f : H ‚Üí Œî be a holomorphic map extending continuously to a map between the boundaries. Let the vertices correspond to points a1, ..., an on the real axis. Then p(x) = S(f)(x) is real-valued for x real and not one of the points. By the Schwarz reflection principle p(x) extends to a rational function on the complex plane with a double pole at ai: : p(z)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{(1-\\\\alpha_i^2)}{2(z-a_i)^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\beta_i}{z-a_i}. The real numbers Œ≤i are called accessory parameters. They are subject to three linear constraints: :\\\\sum \\\\beta_i=0 : \\\\sum 2a_i \\\\beta_i + \\\\left ( 1-\\\\alpha_i^2 \\\\right ) =0 : \\\\sum a_i^2 \\\\beta_i + a_i \\\\left ( 1-\\\\alpha_i^2 \\\\right ) =0 which correspond to the vanishing of the coefficients of z^{-1}, z^{-2} and z^{-3} in the expansion of p(z) around z = ‚àû. The mapping f(z) can then be written as : f(z) = {u_1(z)\\\\over u_2(z)}, where u_1(z) and u_2(z) are linearly independent holomorphic solutions of the linear second-order ordinary differential equation : u^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}(z) + \\\\tfrac{1}{2} p(z)u(z)=0. There are n‚àí3 linearly independent accessory parameters, which can be difficult to determine in practise. For a triangle, when n = 3, there are no accessory parameters. The ordinary differential equation is equivalent to the hypergeometric differential equation and f(z) is the Schwarz triangle function, which can be written in terms of hypergeometric functions. For a quadrilateral the accessory parameters depend on one independent variable Œª. Writing U(z) = q(z)u(z) for a suitable choice of q(z), the ordinary differential equation takes the form : a(z) U^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}(z) + b(z) U^\\\\prime(z) +(c(z)+\\\\lambda)U(z)=0. Thus q(z) u_i(z) are eigenfunctions of a Sturm‚ÄìLiouville equation on the interval [a_i,a_{i+1}]. By the Sturm separation theorem, the non-vanishing of u_2(z) forces Œª to be the lowest eigenvalue. Complex structure on Teichm√ºller space Universal Teichm√ºller space is defined to be the space of real analytic quasiconformal mappings of the unit disc D, or equivalently the upper half-plane H, onto itself, with two mappings considered to be equivalent if on the boundary one is obtained from the other by composition with a M√∂bius transformation. Identifying D with the lower hemisphere of the Riemann sphere, any quasiconformal self-map f of the lower hemisphere corresponds naturally to a conformal mapping of the upper hemisphere \\\\tilde{f} onto itself. In fact \\\\tilde{f} is determined as the restriction to the upper hemisphere of the solution of the Beltrami differential equation : \\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial \\\\overline{z}} = \\\\mu(z) \\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial z}, where Œº is the bounded measurable function defined by :\\\\mu(z) = \\\\frac{ \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial \\\\overline{z}}\\\\right) }{\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right) } on the lower hemisphere, extended to 0 on the upper hemisphere. Identifying the upper hemisphere with D, Lipman Bers used the Schwarzian derivative to define a mapping : g= S(\\\\tilde{f}), which embeds universal Teichm√ºller space into an open subset U of the space of bounded holomorphic functions g on D with the uniform norm. Frederick Gehring showed in 1977 that U is the interior of the closed subset of Schwarzian derivatives of univalent functions. For a compact Riemann surface S of genus greater than 1, its universal covering space is the unit disc D on which its fundamental group Œì acts by M√∂bius transformations. The Teichm√ºller space of S can be identified with the subspace of the universal Teichm√ºller space invariant under Œì. The holomorphic functions g have the property that :g(z) \\\\, dz^2 is invariant under Œì, so determine quadratic differentials on S. In this way, the Teichm√ºller space of S is realized as an open subspace of the finite-dimensional complex vector space of quadratic differentials on S. Diffeomorphism group of the circle =Crossed homomorphisms= The transformation property : S(f \\\\circ g) = \\\\left( S(f)\\\\circ g\\\\right ) \\\\cdot(g')^2+S(g). allows the Schwarzian derivative to be interpreted as a continuous 1-cocycle or crossed homomorphism of the diffeomorphism group of the circle with coefficients in the module of densities of degree 2 on the circle. Let FŒª(S1) be the space of tensor densities of degree Œª on S1. The group of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of S1, Diff(S1), acts on FŒª(S1) via pushforwards. If f is an element of Diff(S1) then consider the mapping :f \\\\to S(f^{-1}). In the language of group cohomology the chain-like rule above says that this mapping is a 1-cocycle on Diff(S1) with coefficients in F2(S1). In fact :H^1(\\\\text{Diff}(\\\\mathbf{S}^1);F_2 (\\\\mathbf{S}^1)) = \\\\mathbf{R} and the 1-cocycle generating the cohomology is f ‚Üí S(f‚àí1). The computation of 1-cohomology is a particular case of the more general result :H^1(\\\\text{Diff}(\\\\mathbf{S}^1);F_\\\\lambda (\\\\mathbf{S}^1)) = \\\\mathbf{R}\\\\,\\\\, \\\\mathrm{for} \\\\,\\\\, \\\\lambda=0,1,2\\\\,\\\\, \\\\mathrm{and} \\\\,\\\\,(0) \\\\,\\\\,\\\\mathrm{otherwise.} Note that if G is a group and M a G-module, then the identity defining a crossed homomorphism c of G into M can be expressed in terms of standard homomorphisms of groups: it is encoded in a homomorphism of G into the semidirect product M\\\\rtimes G such that the composition of with the projection M\\\\rtimes G onto G is the identity map; the correspondence is by the map C(g) = (c(g), g). The crossed homomorphisms form a vector space and containing as a subspace the coboundary crossed homomorphisms b(g) = g ‚ãÖ m ‚àí m for m in M. A simple averaging argument shows that, if K is a compact group and V a topological vector space on which K acts continuously, then the higher cohomology groups vanish Hm(K, V) = (0) for m > 0. n particular for 1-cocycles œá with :\\\\chi(xy) = \\\\chi(x) + x\\\\cdot \\\\chi(y), averaging over y, using left invariant of the Haar measure on K gives :\\\\chi(x) = m - x\\\\cdot m, with :m=\\\\int_K \\\\chi(y)\\\\,dy. Thus by averaging it may be assumed that c satisfies the normalisation condition c(x) = 0 for x in Rot(S1). Note that if any element x in G satisifes c(x) = 0 then C(x) = (0,x). But then, since C is a homomorphism, C(xgx‚àí1) = C(x)C(g)C(x)‚àí1, so that c satisfies the equivariance condition c(xgx‚àí1) = x ‚ãÖ c(g). Thus it may be assumed that the cocycle satisfies these normalisation conditions for Rot(S1). The Schwarzian derivative in fact vanishes whenever x is a M√∂bius transformation corresponding to SU(1,1). The other two 1-cycles discussed below vanish only on Rot(S1) (Œª = 0, 1). There is an infinitesimal version of this result giving a 1-cocycle for Vect(S1), the Lie algebra of smooth vector fields, and hence for the Witt algebra, the subalgebra of trigonometric polynomial vector fields. Indeed, when G is a Lie group and the action of G on M is smooth, there is a Lie algebraic version of crossed homomorphism obtained by taking the corresponding homomorphisms of the Lie algebras (the derivatives of the homomotphisms at the identity). This also makes sense for Diff(S1) and leads to the 1-cocycle : s\\\\left(f\\\\, {d\\\\over d\\\\theta}\\\\right) = {d^3f\\\\over d\\\\theta^3}\\\\,(d\\\\theta)^2 which satisfies the identity :s([X,Y])=X\\\\cdot s(Y) -Y\\\\cdot s(X). In the Lie algebra case, the coboundary maps have the form b(X) = X ‚ãÖ m for m in M. In both cases the 1-cohomology is defined as the space of crossed homomorphisms modulo coboundaries. The natural correspondence between group homomorphisms and Lie algebra homomorphisms leads to the \\"van Est inclusion map\\" :H^1(\\\\operatorname{Diff}(\\\\mathbf{S}^1);F_\\\\lambda (\\\\mathbf{S}^1)) \\\\hookrightarrow H^1(\\\\operatorname{Vect}(\\\\mathbf{S}^1);F_\\\\lambda (\\\\mathbf{S}^1)), In this way the calculation can be reduced to that of Lie algebra cohomology. By continuity this reduces to the computation of crossed homomorphisms of the Witt algebra into FŒª(S1). The normalisations conditions on the group crossed homomorphism imply the following additional conditions for : :\\\\varphi(\\\\operatorname{Ad}(x) X) = x\\\\cdot \\\\varphi(X),\\\\,\\\\, \\\\varphi(d/d\\\\theta) = 0 for x in Rot(S1). Following the conventions of , a basis of the Witt algebra is given by :d_n = i e^{in\\\\theta} \\\\,{d\\\\over d\\\\theta} so that [dm,dn] = (m ‚Äì n) dm + n. A basis for the complexification of FŒª(S1) is given by :v_n=e^{in\\\\theta} \\\\, (d\\\\theta)^\\\\lambda, so that : d_m \\\\cdot v_n = -(n+\\\\lambda m)v_{n+m},\\\\,\\\\, g_\\\\zeta \\\\cdot v_n = \\\\zeta^{n} v_n, for gŒ∂ in Rot(S1) = T. This forces for suitable coefficients . The crossed homomorphism condition gives a recurrence relation for the : : (m-n) a_{m+n} = (m+\\\\lambda n) a_m-(n+\\\\lambda m)a_n. The condition (d/dŒ∏) = 0, implies that a0 = 0. From this condition and the recurrence relation, it follows that up to scalar multiples, this has a unique non-zero solution when Œª equals 0, 1 or 2 and only the zero solution otherwise. The solution for corresponds to the group 1-cocycle \\\\varphi_1(f) =f^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}/f^\\\\prime\\\\, d\\\\theta. The solution for corresponds to the group 1-cocycle 0(f) = log f' . The corresponding Lie algebra 1-cocycles for Œª = 0, 1, 2 are given up to a scalar multiple by :\\\\varphi_\\\\lambda\\\\left(F {d\\\\over d\\\\theta}\\\\right) = {d^{\\\\lambda+1} F\\\\over d\\\\theta^{\\\\lambda +1}} \\\\, (d\\\\theta)^\\\\lambda. =Central extensions= The crossed homomorphisms in turn give rise to the central extension of Diff(S1) and of its Lie algebra Vect(S1), the so-called Virasoro algebra. =Coadjoint action= The group Diff(S1) and its central extension also appear naturally in the context of Teichm√ºller theory and string theory. In fact the homeomorphisms of S1 induced by quasiconformal self-maps of D are precisely the quasisymmetric homeomorphisms of S1; these are exactly homeomorphisms which do not send four points with cross ratio 1/2 to points with cross ratio near 1 or 0. Taking boundary values, universal Teichm√ºller can be identified with the quotient of the group of quasisymmetric homeomorphisms QS(S1) by the subgroup of M√∂bius transformations Moeb(S1). (It can also be realized naturally as the space of quasicircles in C.) Since :\\\\operatorname{Moeb}(\\\\mathbf{S}^1)\\\\subset \\\\operatorname{Diff}(\\\\mathbf{S}^1) \\\\subset \\\\text{QS}(\\\\mathbf{S}^1) the homogeneous space Diff(S1)/Moeb(S1) is naturally a subspace of universal Teichm√ºller space. It is also naturally a complex manifold and this and other natural geometric structures are compatible with those on Teichm√ºller space. The dual of the Lie algebra of Diff(S1) can be identified with the space of Hill's operators on S1 :{d^2\\\\over d\\\\theta^2} + q(\\\\theta), and the coadjoint action of Diff(S1) invokes the Schwarzian derivative. The inverse of the diffeomorphism f sends the Hill's operator to :{d^2\\\\over d\\\\theta^2} + f^\\\\prime(\\\\theta)^2 \\\\,q\\\\circ f(\\\\theta) + \\\\tfrac{1}{2} S(f)(\\\\theta). Pseudogroups and connections The Schwarzian derivative and the other 1-cocycle defined on Diff(S1) can be extended to biholomorphic between open sets in the complex plane. In this case the local description leads to the theory of analytic pseudogroups, formalizing the theory of infinite- dimensional groups and Lie algebras first studied by √âlie Cartan in the 1910s. This is related to affine and projective structures on Riemann surfaces as well as the theory of Schwarzian or projective connections, discussed by Gunning, Schiffer and Hawley. A holomorphic pseudogroup Œì on C consists of a collection of biholomorphisms between open sets U and V in C which contains the identity maps for each open U, which is closed under restricting to opens, which is closed under composition (when possible), which is closed under taking inverses and such that if a biholomorphisms is locally in Œì, then it too is in Œì. The pseudogroup is said to be transitive if, given and in C, there is a biholomorphism in Œì such that . A particular case of transitive pseudogroups are those which are flat, i.e. contain all complex translations . Let G be the group, under composition, of formal power series transformations with . A holomorphic pseudogroup Œì defines a subgroup A of G, namely the subgroup defined by the Taylor series expansion about 0 (or \\"jet\\") of elements of Œì with . Conversely if Œì is flat it is uniquely determined by A: a biholomorphism on U is contained in Œì in if and only if the power series of lies in A for every in U: in other words the formal power series for at is given by an element of A with replaced by ; or more briefly all the jets of f lie in A. The group G has a natural homomorphisms onto the group Gk of k-jets obtained by taking the truncated power series taken up to the term zk. This group acts faithfully on the space of polynomials of degree k (truncating terms of order higher than k). Truncations similarly define homomorphisms of Gk onto Gk ‚àí 1; the kernel consists of maps f with f(z) = z + bzk, so is Abelian. Thus the group Gk is solvable, a fact also clear from the fact that it is in triangular form for the basis of monomials. A flat pseudogroup Œì is said to be \\"defined by differential equations\\" if there is a finite integer k such that homomorphism of A into Gk is faithful and the image is a closed subgroup. The smallest such k is said to be the order of Œì. There is a complete classification of all subgroups A that arise in this way which satisfy the additional assumptions that the image of A in Gk is a complex subgroup and that G1 equals C*: this implies that the pseudogroup also contains the scaling transformations Sa(z) = az for a ‚â† 0, i.e. contains A contains every polynomial az with a ‚â† 0. The only possibilities in this case are that k = 1 and A = {az: a ‚â† 0}; or that k = 2 and A = {az/(1‚àíbz) : a ‚â† 0}. The former is the pseudogroup defined by affine subgroup of the complex M√∂bius group (the az + b transformations fixing ‚àû); the latter is the pseudogroup defined by the whole complex M√∂bius group. This classification can easily be reduced to a Lie algebraic problem since the formal Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g} of G consists of formal vector fields F(z) d/dz with F a formal power series. It contains the polynomial vectors fields with basis dn = zn+1 d/dz (n ‚â• 0), which is a subalgebra of the Witt algebra. The Lie brackets are given by [dm,dn] = (n ‚àí m)dm+n. Again these act on the space of polynomials of degree ‚â§ k by differentiation‚Äîit can be identified with Cz/(zk+1)‚Äîand the images of d0, ..., dk ‚Äì 1 give a basis of the Lie algebra of Gk. Note that . Let \\\\mathfrak{a} denote the Lie algebra of A: it is isomorphic to a subalgebra of the Lie algebra of Gk. It contains d0 and is invariant under Ad(Sa). Since \\\\mathfrak{a} is a Lie subalgebra of the Witt algebra, the only possibility is that it has basis d0 or basis d0, dn for some n ‚â• 1. There are corresponding group elements of the form f(z)= z + bzn+1 \\\\+ .... Composing this with translations yields T‚Äìf(Œµ) ‚àò f ‚àò T Œµ(z) = cz + dz2 \\\\+ ... with c, d ‚â† 0. Unless n = 2, this contradicts the form of subgroup A; so n = 2. The Schwarzian derivative is related to the pseudogroup for the complex M√∂bius group. In fact if f is a biholomorphism defined on V then 2(f) = S(f) is a quadratic differential on V. If g is a bihomolorphism defined on U and g(V) ‚äÜ U, S(f ‚àò g) and S(g) are quadratic differentials on U; moreover S(f) is a quadratic differential on V, so that g‚àóS(f) is also a quadratic differential on U. The identity : S(f\\\\circ g) = g_*S(f) + S(g) is thus the analogue of a 1-cocycle for the pseudogroup of biholomorphisms with coefficients in holomorphic quadratic differentials. Similarly \\\\varphi_0(f) = \\\\log f^\\\\prime and \\\\varphi_1(f) = f^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}/f^\\\\prime are 1-cocycles for the same pseudogroup with values in holomorphic functions and holomorphic differentials. In general 1-cocycle can be defined for holomorphic differentials of any order so that :\\\\varphi(f\\\\circ g) = g_*\\\\varphi(f) + \\\\varphi(g). Applying the above identity to inclusion maps j, it follows that (j) = 0 ;and hence that if f1 is the restriction of f2, so that f2 ‚àò j = f1, then (f1) = (f2). On the other hand, taking the local holomororphic flow defined by holomorphic vector fields,‚Äîthe exponential of the vector fields‚Äîthe holomorphic pseudogroup of local biholomorphisms is generated by holomorphic vector fields. If the 1-cocycle satisfies suitable continuity or analyticity conditions, it induces a 1-cocycle of holomorphic vector fields, also compatible with restriction. Accordingly, it defines a 1-cocycle on holomorphic vector fields on C: :\\\\varphi([X,Y]) = X \\\\varphi(Y) - Y \\\\varphi(X). Restricting to the Lie algebra of polynomial vector fields with basis dn = zn+1 d/dz (n ‚â• ‚àí1), these can be determined using the same methods of Lie algebra cohomology (as in the previous section on crossed homomorphisms). There the calculation was for the whole Witt algebra acting on densities of order k, whereas here it is just for a subalgebra acting on holomorphic (or polynomial) differentials of order k. Again, assuming that vanishes on rotations of C, there are non-zero 1-cocycles, unique up to scalar multiples. only for differentials of degree 0, 1 and 2 given by the same derivative formula :\\\\varphi_k\\\\left(p(z) {d\\\\over dz}\\\\right) = p^{(k+1)}(z) \\\\, (dz)^k, where p(z) is a polynomial. The 1-cocycles define the three pseudogroups by k(f) = 0: this gives the scaling group (k = 0); the affine group (k = 1); and the whole complex M√∂bius group (k = 2). So these 1-cocycles are the special ordinary differential equations defining the pseudogroup. More significantly they can be used to define corresponding affine or projective structures and connections on Riemann surfaces. If Œì is a pseudogroup of smooth mappings on Rn, a topological space M is said to have a Œì-structure if it has a collection of charts f that are homeomorphisms from open sets Vi in M to open sets Ui in Rn such that, for every non-empty intersection, the natural map from to lies in Œì. This defines the structure of a smooth n-manifold if Œì consists of local diffeomorphims and a Riemann surface if n = 2‚Äîso that R2 ‚â° C‚Äîand Œì consists of biholomorphisms. If Œì is the affine pseudogroup, M is said to have an affine structure; and if Œì is the M√∂bius pseudogroup, M is said to have a projective structure. Thus a genus one surface given as C/Œõ for some lattice Œõ ‚äÇ C has an affine structure; and a genus p > 1 surface given as the quotient of the upper half plane or unit disk by a Fuchsian group has a projective structure. describes how this process can be reversed: for genus p > 1, the existence of a projective connection, defined using the Schwarzian derivative 2 and proved using standard results on cohomology, can be used to identify the universal covering surface with the upper half plane or unit disk (a similar result holds for genus 1, using affine connections and 1).

After the destruction of the Temple, the mikveh's main uses remained as follows: * by Jewish women to achieve ritual purity after menstruation and childbirth before they and their husbands may resume marital relations; * by Jewish men to achieve ritual purity after ejaculation; * as part of the traditional procedure for conversion to Judaism; * to immerse newly acquired metal and glass utensils used in serving and eating food; * to immerse a corpse as part of the preparation for burial (taharah). Most forms of ritual impurity can be purified through immersion in any natural collection of water. However, some impurities, such as a zav, require \\"living water\\",Leviticus 15:13 such as springs or groundwater wells. Living water has the further advantage of being able to purify even while flowing, as opposed to rainwater which must be stationary in order to purify. The mikveh is designed to simplify this requirement, by providing a bathing facility that remains in contact with a natural source of water. In Orthodox Judaism, these regulations are steadfastly adhered to, and, consequently, the mikveh is central to an Orthodox Jewish community; they formally hold in Conservative Judaism as well. The existence of a mikveh is considered so important that a Jewish community is required to construct a mikveh even before building a synagogue, and must go to the extreme of selling Torah scrolls or even a synagogue if necessary, to provide funding for its construction.Rabbi Naftali Tzvi Yehuda Berlin, Meshiv Dabar, 1:45 Etymology In the Hebrew Bible, the word is employed in its broader sense, but generally means a collection of water. History Excavated mikveh in Qumran Before the beginning of the first century BCE, neither written sources, nor archaeology gives any indication about the existence of specific installations used for ritual cleansing. Mikvoth appear at the beginning of the first century BCE, and from then on, ancient mikvoth can be found throughout the land of Israel, as well as in historic communities of the Jewish diaspora. In October 2020, a 2,000-year-old mikveh was found near Hannaton in northern Israel. Requirements Modern mikveh ‚Äì schematic illustration The traditional rules regarding the construction of a mikveh are based on those specified in classical rabbinical literature. According to these rules, a mikveh must be connected to a natural spring or well of naturally occurring water, and thus can be supplied by rivers and lakes which have natural springs as their source. A cistern filled by the rainwater is also permitted to act as a mikveh's water supply so long as the water is never collected in a vessel. Similarly snow, ice and hail are allowed to act as the supply of water to a mikveh no matter how they were transferred to the mikveh.. A river that dries up upon occasion cannot be used because it is presumed to be rainwater and not spring water, which cannot purify while in a flowing state. Oceans and seas for the most part have the status of natural springs. A mikveh must, according to the classical regulations, contain enough water to cover the entire body of an average-sized person; based on a mikveh with the dimensions of 3 cubits deep, 1 cubit wide, and 1 cubit long, the necessary volume of water was estimated as being 40 seah of water. The exact volume referred to by a seah is debated, and classical rabbinical literature specifies only that it is enough to fit 144 eggs;Numbers Rabbah, 18:17 most Orthodox Jews use the stringent ruling of the Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz, according to which one seah is 14.3 litres, and therefore, a mikveh must contain approximately 575 litres.about 3 Koku, about 116 qafiz, about 126 Imperial Gallons, about 143 Burmese tins, and about 150 U.S. liquid gallons This volume of water can later be topped up with water from any source,. but if there were less than 40 seahs of water in the mikveh, then the addition of 3 or more pints of water that was at any time intentionally collected in any vessel or transferred by a human, would render the mikveh unfit for use, regardless of whether water from a natural source was then added to make up 40 seahs from a natural source; a mikveh rendered unfit for use in this way would need to be completely drained away and refilled from scratch in the prescribed way. Although not commonly accepted, at least one American Orthodox rabbi advocated a home mikvah using tap water. As water flows through only pipes that open at both ends, the municipal and in-home plumbing would be construed as a non-vessel. So long as the pipes, hoses, and fittings are all freestanding and not held in the hand, they could be used to fill a mikvah receptacle that met all other requirements. There are also classical requirements for the manner in which the water can be stored and transported to the pool; the water must flow naturally to the mikveh from the source, which essentially means that it must be supplied by gravity or a natural pressure gradient, and the water cannot be pumped there by hand or carried. It was also forbidden for the water to pass through any vessel which could hold water within it or is capable of becoming impure (anything made of metal) (however pipes open to the air at both ends are fine so long as there is no significant curviture) As a result, tap water could not be used as the primary water source for a mikveh, although it can be used to top the water up to a suitable level. To avoid issues with these rules in large cities, various methods are employed to establish a valid mikveh. One is that tap water is made to flow into a kosher mikveh, and through a conduit into a larger pool. A second method is to create a mikveh in a deep pool, place a floor with holes over that and then fill the upper pool with tap water. In this way, it is considered as if the person dipping is actually \\"in\\" the pool of rain water. Most contemporary mikvoth are indoor constructions involving rainwater collected from a cistern and passed through a duct by gravity into an ordinary bathing pool; the mikveh can be heated, taking into account certain rules, often resulting in an environment not unlike a spa. A mikveh must be built into the ground or built as an essential part of a building. Portable receptacles, such as bathtubs, whirlpools or Jacuzzis, can therefore never function as mikvehs. Reasons for immersion in a mikveh =Historic reasons= Medieval Mikveh room in the old Synagogue of Sopron, Hungary, which dates to the 14th century A medieval mikveh in Besal√∫, Spain A mikveh from Boskovice in the Czech Republic Traditionally, the mikveh was used by both men and women to regain ritual purity after various events, according to regulations laid down in the Torah and in classical rabbinical literature. The Torah requires full immersion * after Keri ‚Äî normal emissions of semen, whether from sexual activity, or from nocturnal emission. Bathing in a mikveh due to Keri is required by the Torah in order that one should be allowed to consume from a heave offering or sacrifice; while Ezra instituted that one should also do so in order to be allowed to recite words of Torah. The latter case is known as tevilath Ezra (\\"the immersion of Ezra\\") * after Zav/Zavah ‚Äî abnormal discharges of body fluids * after Tzaraath ‚Äî certain skin condition(s). These are termed lepra in the Septuagint, and therefore traditionally translated into English as leprosy; this is probably a translation error, as the Greek term lepra mostly refers to psoriasis, and the Greek term for leprosy was elephas or elephantiasis. * by anyone who came into contact with someone suffering from Zav/Zavah, or into contact with someone still in Niddah (normal menstruation), or who comes into contact with articles that have been used or sat upon by such persons * by a Kohen who is being consecrated, * by the Kohen Gadol on Yom Kippur, after sending away the goat to Azazel, and by the man who leads away the goat, , * by the Kohen who performed the Red Heifer ritual * after contact with a corpse or grave, in addition to having the ashes of the Red heifer ritual sprinkled upon them * after eating meat from an animal that died naturally Classical rabbinical writers conflated the rules for zavah and niddah. It also became customary for Kohanim to fully immerse themselves before Jewish holidays, and the laity of many communities subsequently adopted this practice. Converts to Judaism are required to undergo full immersion in water. =In Modern Judaism= Some Jewish funeral homes have a mikveh for immersing a body during the purification procedure (taharah) before burial. Orthodox Judaism Orthodox Judaism generally adheres to the classical regulations and traditions, and consequently Orthodox Jewish women are obligated to immerse in a mikveh between Niddah and sexual relations with their husbands. This includes brides before their marriage, and married women after their menstruation period or childbirth. In accordance with Orthodox rules concerning modesty, men and women are required to immerse in separate mikveh facilities in separate locations, or to use the mikveh at different designated times. Converts to Orthodox Judaism, regardless of gender, are also required to immerse in a mikveh. It is customary for Orthodox Jews to immerse before Yom Kippur,Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim, 581:4 and 606:4 and married women sometimes do so as well. In the customs of certain Jewish communities, men also use a mikveh before Jewish holidays; the men in certain communities, especially hasidic and haredi groups, also practice immersion before each Shabbat, and some immerse in a mikveh every single day. Although the Temple Mount is treated by many Orthodox Jewish authorities as being forbidden territory, a number of groups permit access, but require immersion before ascending the Mount as a precaution. Orthodox Judaism requires that vessels and utensils must be immersed in a mikveh before being used for food, if purchased or received from a non-Jew. =Obligatory immersion in Orthodox Judaism= Immersion in a mikveh is obligatory in contemporary Orthodox Jewish practice in the following circumstances: * Women ** Following the niddah period after menstruation, prior to resuming marital relations ** Following the niddah period after childbirth, prior to resuming marital relations ** By a bride, before her wedding * Either gender ** As part of a conversion to Judaism * Immersion of utensils acquired from a gentile and used for food =Customary immersion in Orthodox Judaism= Immersion in a mikveh is customary in contemporary Orthodox Jewish practice in the following circumstances: * Men ** By a bridegroom, on the day of his wedding, according to the custom of some communities ** By a father, prior to the circumcision of his son, according to the custom of some communities ** By a kohen, prior to a service in which he will recite the priestly blessing, according to the custom of some communities ** Before Yom Kippur, according to the custom of some communities ** Erev Rosh HaShona, according to the custom of some communities ** Before a Jewish holiday, according to the custom of some communities ** Weekly before Shabbat, under Hasidic and Haredi customs ** Every day, under Hasidic customs Immersion for men is more common in Hasidic communities, and non-existent in others, like German Jewish communities. =Recent Orthodox writings= Rabbi Aryeh KaplanWaters of Eden by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan. . connects the laws of impurity to the narrative in the beginning of Genesis. According to Genesis, by eating of the fruit, Adam and Eve had brought death into the world. Kaplan points out that most of the laws of impurity relate to some form of death (or in the case of Niddah the loss of a potential life). One who comes into contact with one of the forms of death must then immerse in water which is described in Genesis as flowing out of the Garden of Eden (the source of life) in order to cleanse oneself of this contact with death (and by extension of sin). Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook offered an additional message for mikveh: By immersing ourselves in water, \\"we are forced to recognize our existential estrangement from the physical universe. How long can we survive under water? The experience of submerging drives home the realization that our existence in this world is transient, and we should strive towards more lasting goals. Conservative Judaism The mikveh at the American Jewish University in Los Angeles, California In a series of responsa on the subject of Niddah in December 2006, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of Conservative Judaism reaffirmed a requirement that Conservative women use a mikveh monthly following the end of the niddah period following menstruation, while adopting certain leniencies including reducing the length of the nidda period. The three responsa adopted permit a range of approaches from an opinion reaffirming the traditional ritual to an opinion declaring the concept of ritual purity does not apply outside the Temple in Jerusalem, proposing a new theological basis for the ritual, adapting new terminology including renaming the observances related to menstruation from taharat hamishpacha family purity to kedushat hamishpaha [family holiness] to reflect the view that the concept of ritual purity is no longer considered applicable, and adopting certain leniencies including reducing the length of the niddah period.Rabbi Miriam Berkowitz, Mikveh and the Sanctity of Family Relations, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, December 6, 2006 Rabbi Susan Grossman, Mikveh And The Sanctity Of Being Created Human, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, December 6, 2006Rabbi Avram Reisner, Observing Niddah In Our Day: An Inquiry On The Status Of Purity And The Prohibition Of Sexual Activity With A Menstruant, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, December 6, 2006Rabbi Miriam Berkowitz, RESHAPING THE LAWS OF FAMILY PURITY FOR THE MODERN WORLD, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, December 6, 2006 Isaac Klein's A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice, a comprehensive guide frequently used within Conservative Judaism, also addresses Conservative views on other uses of a mikveh, but because it predates the 2006 opinions, it describes an approach more closely resembling the Orthodox one, and does not address the leniencies and views those opinions reflected. Rabbi Miriam Berkowitz's recent book Taking the Plunge: A Practical and Spiritual Guide to the Mikveh (Jerusalem: Schechter Institute, 2007) offers a comprehensive discussion of contemporary issues and new mikveh uses along with traditional reasons for observance, details of how to prepare and what to expect, and how the laws developed. Conservative Judaism encourages, but does not require, immersion before Jewish Holidays (including Yom Kippur), nor the immersion of utensils purchased from non-Jews. New uses are being developed throughout the liberal world for healing (after rape, incest, divorce, etc.) or celebration (milestone birthdays, anniversaries, ordination, or reading Torah for the first time). As in Orthodox Judaism, converts to Judaism through the Conservative movement are required to immerse themselves in a mikveh. Two Jews must witness the event, at least one of which must actually see the immersion. Immersion into a mikveh has been described as a very emotional, life-changing experience similar to a graduation.Freudenheim, Susan. \\"Becoming Jewish: Tales from the Mikveh.\\" Jewish Journal. 8 May 2013. 8 May 2013. Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism Restored mikveh in White Stork Synagogue, Wroclaw. Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism do not hold the halachic requirements of mikveh the way Orthodox Judaism does. However, there are growing trends toward using mikveh for conversions, wedding preparation, and even before holidays. In the 21st century the mikveh is experiencing a revival among progressive Jews who view immersion as a way to mark transitions in their lives. \\"Open\\" mikvoth welcome Jews to consider immersion for reasons not necessarily required by Jewish law; they might immerse following a divorce or medical treatment, to find closure after an abortion, or to celebrate a life transition, among other reasons.What is the mikvah all about? The Washington Post, Nov 7, 2014 Progressive Jews may also use the mikveh for conversion.the New American Mikveh Tablet Magazine, Aug 13, 2012  During pregnancy  In some Jewish communities it is customary that at some point during the ninth month of a woman's pregnancy she should dip in a mikveh. Requirements during use There is supposed to be no barrier between the person immersing and the water. The person should be wearing no clothes, jewelry, makeup, nail polish, fake nails, or grooming products on the hair or skin. For more observant Jewish women, an attendant will assure these requirements are met.What is the mikvah all about? The Washington Post, November 7, 2014, Showering or bathing and carefully checking the whole body is, therefore, part of the religious requirements before entering the water of a Mikveh for a woman. =Hair= According to rabbinical tradition, the hair counts as part of the body, and therefore, water is required to touch all parts of it, meaning that braids cannot be worn during immersion; this has resulted in debate between the various ethnic groups within Judaism, about whether hair combing is necessary before immersion. The Ashkenazi community generally supports the view that hair must be combed straight so that there are no knots, but some take issue with this stance, particularly when it comes to dreadlocks. A number of rabbinical rulings argue in support of dreadlocks, on the basis that * dreadlocks can sometimes be loose enough to become thoroughly saturated with water, particularly if the person had first showered * combing dreadlocked hair can be painful * although a particularly cautious individual would consider a single knotted hair as an obstruction, in most cases hair is loose enough for water to pass through it unless each hair is individually knottedKolel Menachem, Kitzur Dinei Taharah: A Digest of the Niddah Laws Following the Rulings of the Rebbes of Chabad (Brooklyn, New York: Kehot Publication Society, 2005). Allegorical uses of the term mikveh The word mikveh makes use of the same root letters in Hebrew as the word for \\"hope\\" and this has served as the basis for homiletical comparison of the two concepts in both biblical and rabbinic literature. For instance, in the Book of Jeremiah, the word mikveh is used in the sense of \\"hope\\", but at the same time also associated with \\"living water\\": In the Mishnah, following on from a discussion about Yom Kippur, immersion in a Mikveh is compared by Rabbi Akiva with the relationship between God and Israel. Akiva refers to the description of God in the Book of Jeremiah as the \\"Mikveh of Israel\\", and suggests that \\"just as a mikveh purifies the contaminated, so does the Holy One, blessed is he, purify Israel\\". A different allegory is used by many Jews adhering to a belief in resurrection as one of the Thirteen Principles of Faith. Since \\"living water\\" in a lifeless frozen state (as ice) is still likely to again become living water (after melting), it became customary in traditional Jewish bereavement rituals to read the seventh chapter of the Mikvaot tractate in the Mishnah, following a funeral; the Mikvaot tractate covers the laws of the mikveh, and the seventh chapter starts with a discussion of substances which can be used as valid water sources for a mikveh ‚Äì snow, hail, frost, ice, salt, and pourable mud. Controversies =Use by Reform and Conservative converts= The Reform Movement‚Äôs Israel Religious Action Center sued the state on behalf of the Reform and Conservative/Masorti movements to allow members to use publicly funded mikvoth. The case, which took ten years to resolve, resulted in the Israeli Supreme Court ruling that public ritual baths must accept all prospective converts to Judaism, including converts to Reform and Conservative Judaism. In his 2016 ruling, Supreme Court Justice Elyakim Rubinstein said barring certain converts amounts to discrimination. Until this ruling, Orthodox officials barred non-Orthodox converts from using any mikveh, claiming their traditions do not conform to Jewish law, and the people they convert are therefore not Jews. Rubinstein noted: \\"Once it established public mikvahs, and put them at the service of the public ‚Äî including for the process of conversion ‚Äî the State cannot but be even-handed in allowing their use.\\" He also said. \\"The State of Israel is free to supervise the use of its mikvahs, so long as it does so in an egalitarian manner.\\"Israel‚Äôs Supreme Court: Public ritual baths must accept non-Orthodox, too Religion news, Feb 14, 2016 =Intrusive questions= In 2013, the Israeli Center for Women's Justice and Kolech, an organization committed to Orthodox Jewish feminism, petitioned the Supreme Court to forbid attendants from asking intrusive questions of women at state-funded and -operated mikvot. In response, the Chief Rabbinate said it would forbid questioning of women about their marital status before immersion. The complaint had charged that the practice represented unacceptable discrimination.Don‚Äôt Ask, Don‚Äôt Tell; ‚Äì the New Mikveh Policy haaretz, May 10, 2013 In 2015, however, the ITIM Advocacy Center filed a complaint with the Israeli Supreme Court on behalf of 13 Orthodox women against the Chief Rabbinate and the Jerusalem Religious Council, insisting that women be allowed to use the mikvah \\"according to their personal customs and without supervision, or with their own attendant if they wish\\". The complaint charged that the Chief Rabbinate is ignoring directives passed in 2013 that allow women to use the mikvah facilities without being asked intrusive questions by attendants.Israeli NGO asks Supreme Court to protect women‚Äôs rights at mikvah Times of Israel, July 20, 2015 In June 2016, the Chief Rabbinate agreed to allow women to use a mikveh without an attendant.Israeli Women to Be Allowed to Bathe in Mikvehs Without an Attendant Haaretz, June 23, 2016 = Transgender people = Some transgender people have adopted the practice of mikveh immersion to mark a gender transition. However, many Orthodox authorities who control mikvaot only permit immersions that adhere with Jewish law. Therefore, other Jewish organizations strive to create mikvaot that allow for different uses, such as marking any important life transitions. Mayyim Hayyim, an organization in Newton, Massachusetts, collaborated with Keshet, one of Boston's LGBT Jewish organizations, to actively create a mikveh space that felt accessible to transgender people, including training mikveh guides on gender issues. There is some controversy within the Jewish transgender community about the use of mikvah to mark gender transitions. Some feel uncomfortable in a space that is traditionally so highly gendered and that requires complete nudity. Others still see mikveh as a place for married women to go after their periods, and therefore a transgender female would be exempt from these requirements as she does not menstruate.

Permeable pavement surfaces typically include pervious concrete, porous asphalt, paving stones and interlocking pavers. Unlike traditional impervious paving materials, permeable paving systems allow stormwater to percolate and infiltrate through the pavement and into the aggregate layers and/or soil below. In addition to reducing surface runoff, permeable paving systems can trap suspended solids, thereby filtering pollutants from stormwater.Interlocking Concrete Pavement Institute, http://www.icpi.org/sustainable The goal is to control stormwater at the source, reduce runoff and improve water quality by filtering pollutants in the subsurface layers. Permeable pavement surfaces are made of either a porous material that enables stormwater to flow through it or nonporous blocks spaced so that water can flow between the gaps. Stormwater flows into and is stored in an underlying stone reservoir. Permeable pavement is commonly used on roads, paths and parking lots subject to light vehicular traffic, such as cycle-paths, service or emergency access lanes, road and airport shoulders, and residential sidewalks and driveways.  Description and applications  Permeable solutions can be based on: porous asphalt and concrete surfaces, concrete pavers (permeable interlocking concrete paving systems ‚Äì PICP), or polymer-based grass pavers, grids and geocells. Porous pavements and concrete pavers (actually the voids in-between them) enable stormwater to drain through a stone base layer for on-site infiltration and filtering. Polymer based grass grid or cellular paver systems provide load bearing reinforcement for unpaved surfaces of gravel or turf. Grass pavers, plastic turf reinforcing grids (PTRG), and geocells (cellular confinement systems) are honeycombed 3D grid- cellular systems, made of thin-walled HDPE plastic or other polymer alloys. These provide grass reinforcement, ground stabilization and gravel retention. The 3D structure reinforces infill and transfers vertical loads from the surface, distributing them over a wider area. Selection of the type of cellular grid depends to an extent on the surface material, traffic and loads. The cellular grids are installed on a prepared base layer of open-graded stone (higher void spacing) or engineered stone (stronger). The surface layer may be compacted gravel or topsoil seeded with grass and fertilizer. In addition to load support, the cellular grid reduces compaction of the soil to maintain permeability, while the roots improve permeability due to their root channels.Stormwater Management, http://www.epa.gov/oaintrnt/stormwater/index.htm In new suburban growth, porous pavements protect watersheds by delaying and filtering the surge flow. In existing built-up areas and towns, redevelopment and reconstruction are opportunities to implement stormwater water management practices. Permeable paving is an important component in Low Impact Development (LID), a process for land development in the United States that attempts to minimize impacts on water quality and the similar concept of sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) in the United Kingdom. The infiltration capacity of the native soil is a key design consideration for determining the depth of base rock for stormwater storage or for whether an underdrain system is needed.  Advantages  = Managing runoff = Permeable paving surfaces have been demonstrated as effective in managing runoff from paved surfaces.Brattebo, B. O., and D. B. Booth. 2003. \\"Long-Term Stormwater Quantity and Quality Performance of Permeable Pavement Systems.\\" Water Research. 37: 4369‚Äì4376. United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, D.C. \\"Field Evaluation of Permeable Pavements for Stormwater Management, Olympia, Washington.\\" Fact Sheet. October 2000. Document No. EPA-841-B-00-005B. Large volumes of urban runoff causes serious erosion and siltation in surface water bodies. Permeable pavers provide a solid ground surface, strong enough to take heavy loads, like large vehicles, while at the same time they allow water to filter through the surface and reach the underlying soils, mimicking natural ground absorption. They can reduce downstream flooding and stream bank erosion, and maintain base flows in rivers to keep ecosystems self-sustaining. Permeable pavers also combat erosion that occurs when grass is dry or dead, by replacing grassed areas in suburban and residential environments. = Controlling pollutants = Permeable paving surfaces keep the pollutants in place in the soil or other material underlying the roadway, and allow water seepage to groundwater recharge while preventing the stream erosion problems. They capture the heavy metals that fall on them, preventing them from washing downstream and accumulating inadvertently in the environment. In the void spaces, naturally occurring micro-organisms digest car oils, leaving little but carbon dioxide and water. Rainwater infiltration is usually less than that of an impervious pavement with a separate stormwater management facility somewhere downstream. .in areas where infiltration is not possible due to unsuitable soil conditions permeable pavements are used in the attenuation mode where water is retained in the pavement and slowly released to surface water systems between storm events. = Trees = Permeable pavements may give urban trees the rooting space they need to grow to full size. A \\"structural-soil\\" pavement base combines structural aggregate with soil; a porous surface admits vital air and water to the rooting zone. This integrates healthy ecology and thriving cities, with the living tree canopy above, the city's traffic on the ground, and living tree roots below. The benefits of permeables on urban tree growth have not been conclusively demonstrated and many researchers have observed tree growth is not increased if construction practices compact materials before permeable pavements are installed.  Disadvantages  = Runoff volumes = Permeable pavements are designed to replace Effective Impervious Areas (EIAs), not to manage stormwater from other impervious surfaces on site. Use of this technique must be part of an overall on site management system for stormwater, and is not a replacement for other techniques. During large storm event, the water table below the porous pavement can rise to a higher level, preventing the precipitation from being absorbed into the ground. Some additional water is stored in the open graded or crushed drain rock base, and remains until the subgrade can absorb the water. For clay-based soils, or other low to 'non'-draining soils, it is important to increase the depth of the crushed drain rock base to allow additional capacity for the water as it waits to be infiltrated. The best way to prevent this problem is to understand the soil infiltration rate, and design the pavement and base depths to meet the volume of water. Or, allow for adequate rain water run off at the pavement design stage. = Pollutant load = Runoff across some land uses may become contaminated, where pollutant concentrations exceed those typically found in stormwater. These \\"hot spots\\" include commercial plant nurseries, recycling facilities, fueling stations, industrial storage, marinas, some outdoor loading facilities, public works yards, hazardous materials generators (if containers are exposed to rainfall), vehicle service and maintenance areas, and vehicle and equipment washing and steam cleaning facilities. Since porous pavement is an infiltration practice, it should not be applied at stormwater hot spots due to the potential for groundwater contamination. All contaminated runoff should be prevented from entering municipal storm drain systems by using best management practices (BMPs) for the specific industry or activity.Capital Regional District. Victoria, BC. \\"Regulating Stormwater Discharges.\\" Accessed 2010-03-19. = Weight and traffic volumes = Reference sources differ on whether low or medium traffic volumes and weights are appropriate for porous pavements. For example, around truck loading docks and areas of high commercial traffic, porous pavement is sometimes cited as being inappropriate. However, given the variability of products available, the growing number of existing installations in North America and targeted research by both manufacturers and user agencies, the range of accepted applications seems to be expanding. Some concrete paver companies have developed products specifically for industrial applications. Working examples exist at fire halls, busy retail complex parking lots, and on public and private roads, including intersections in parts of North America with quite severe winter conditions. = Siting = Permeable pavements may not be appropriate when land surrounding or draining into the pavement exceeds a 20 percent slope, where pavement is down slope from buildings or where foundations have piped drainage at their footers. The key is to ensure that drainage from other parts of a site is intercepted and dealt with separately rather than being directed onto permeable surfaces. = Climate = Cold climates may present special challenges. Road salt contains chlorides that could migrate through the porous pavement into groundwater. Snow plow blades could catch block edges and damage surfaces. Sand cannot be used for snow and ice control on porous surfaces because it will plug the pores and reduce permeability. Although there are design modifications to reduce the risks, infiltrating runoff may freeze below the pavement, causing frost heave. Another issue is spalling damage. Spalling damage exclusively occurs on porous concrete pavement from salt application during the winter season. Thus porous paving is suggested for warmer climates. However, other materials have proven to be effective, even lowering winter maintenance costs by preserving salt in the pavement itself. This also reduces the amount of storm water runoff that is contaminated with salt chlorides. Porous pavement designed to reduce frost heave and spalling damage has been used successfully in Norway. Furthermore, experience suggests that preventive measures with rapid drainage below porous surfaces be taken in order to increase the rate of snow melt above ground. = Cost = Some estimates put the cost of permeable paving at two to three times that of conventional asphalt paving. Using permeable paving, however, can reduce the cost of providing larger or more stormwater BMPs on site, and these savings should be factored into any cost analysis. In addition, the off-site environmental impact costs of not reducing on-site stormwater volumes and pollution have historically been ignored or assigned to other groups (local government parks, public works and environmental restoration budgets, fisheries losses, etc.) The City of Olympia, Washington is studying the use of pervious concrete quite closely and finding that new stormwater regulations are making it a viable alternative to storm water. = Longevity and maintenance = Some permeable pavements require frequent maintenance because grit or gravel can block the open pores. This is commonly done by industrial vacuums that suck up all the sediment. If maintenance is not carried out on a regular basis, the porous pavements can begin to function more like impervious surfaces. With more advanced paving systems the levels of maintenance needed can be greatly decreased, elastomerically bound glass pavements requires less maintenance than regular concrete paving as the glass bound pavement has 50% more void space. Plastic grid systems, if selected and installed correctly, are becoming more and more popular with local government maintenance personnel owing to the reduction in maintenance efforts: reduced gravel migration and weed suppression in public park settings. Some permeable paving products are prone to damage from misuse, such as drivers who tear up patches of plastic & gravel grid systems by \\"joy riding\\" on remote parking lots at night. The damage is not difficult to repair but can look unsightly in the meantime. Grass pavers require supplemental watering in the first year to establish the vegetation, otherwise they may need to be re-seeded. Regional climate also means that most grass applications will go dormant during the dry season. While brown vegetation is only a matter of aesthetics, it can influence public support for this type of permeable paving. Traditional permeable concrete paving bricks tend to lose their color in relatively short time which can be costly to replace or clean and is mainly due to the problem of efflorescence. = Efflorescence = Efflorescence is a hardened crystalline deposit of salts, principally calcium carbonates, which migrate from the center of concrete or masonry materials to the surface, where they form insoluble deposits that harden on the surface. Efflorescence usually appears white, gray or black depending on the region. Over time, efflorescence begins to degrade the overall appearance of masonry/concrete and may cause the surfaces to become slippery when exposed to moisture. If left unchecked, this efflorescence will harden whereby the calcium/lime deposits begin to affect the integrity of the cementitious surface by slowly eroding away the cement paste and aggregate. In some cases it will also discolor stained or coated surfaces. Efflorescence forms more quickly in areas that are exposed to excessive amounts of moisture, such as near pool decks, spas, and fountains or where irrigation runoff is present. The affected regions become very slick when wet. This can be of serious concern especially as a public safety issue to individuals, principals and property owners by exposing them to possible injury and increased general liability claims. Efflorescence remover chemicals can be used to remove calcium/lime build-up without damaging the integrity of the paving surface.  Types of Permeable Pavement  Installation of porous pavements is no more difficult than that of dense pavements, but has different specifications and procedures which must be strictly adhered to. Nine different families of porous paving materials present distinctive advantages and disadvantages for specific applications. Here are examples: = Pervious concrete = Pervious concrete is widely available, can bear frequent traffic, and is universally accessible. Pervious concrete quality depends on the installer's knowledge and experience.EPA. National Menu of Stormwater Best Management Practices. 2009-09-10. \\"Pervious Concrete Pavement.\\" = Plastic grids = Plastic grids allow for a 100% porous system using structural grid systems for containing and stabilizing either gravel or turf. These grids come in a variety of shapes and sizes depending on use; from pathways to commercial parking lots. These systems have been used readily in Europe for over a decade, but are gaining popularity in North America due to requirements by government for many projects to meet LEED environmental building standards. Plastic grid system are also popular with homeowners due to their lower cost to install, ease of installation, and versatility. The ideal design for this type of grid system is a closed cell system, which prevents gravel/sand/turf from migrating laterally. = Porous asphalt = Porous asphalt is produced and placed using the same methods as conventional asphalt concrete; it differs in that fine (small) aggregates are omitted from the asphalt mixture. The remaining large, single-sized aggregate particles leave open voids that give the material its porosity and permeability. To ensure pavement strength, fiber may be added to the mix or a polymer-modified asphalt binder may be used. Generally, porous asphalt pavements are designed with a subsurface reservoir that holds water that passes through the pavement, allowing it to evaporate and/or percolate slowly into the surround soils.National Menu of Stormwater Best Management Practices. 2009-09-10. Open-graded friction courses (OGFC) are a porous asphalt surface course used on highways to improve driving safety by removing water from the surface. Unlike a full-depth porous asphalt pavement, OGFCs do not drain water to the base of a pavement. Instead, they allow water to infiltrate the top 3/4 to 1.5 inch of the pavement and then drain out to the side of the roadway. This can improve the friction characteristics of the road and reduce road spray. = Single-sized aggregate = Single-sized aggregate without any binder, e.g. loose gravel, stone- chippings, is another alternative. Although it can only be safely used in walkways and very low-speed, low-traffic settings, e.g. car-parks and drives, its potential cumulative area is great. = Porous turf = Grass pavement Porous turf, if properly constructed, can be used for occasional parking like that at churches and stadia. Plastic turf reinforcing grids can be used to support the increased load.Bean, Eban Z.; Hunt, William F.; Bidelspach, David A.; Smith, Jonathan T. (2004).\\"Study on the Surface Infiltration Rate of Permeable Pavements.\\" North Carolina State University, Biological and Agricultural Engineering Dept. Raleigh, NC.EPA. \\"Permeable pavers.\\" Stormwater Management Best Practices. Accessed 2010-06-17. Living turf transpires water, actively counteracting the \\"heat island\\" with what appears to be a green open lawn. = Permeable interlocking concrete pavements = Permeable interlocking concrete pavements are concrete units with open, permeable spaces between the units. They give an architectural appearance, and can bear both light and heavy traffic, particularly interlocking concrete pavers, excepting high- volume or high-speed roads.National Menu of Stormwater Best Management Practices. 2009-09-10. Some products are polymer-coated and have an entirely porous face. = Permeable clay brick pavements = Permeable clay brick pavements are fired clay brick units with open, permeable spaces between the units. Clay pavers provide a durable surface that allows stormwater runoff to permeate through the joints. = Resin-bound paving = Resin bound paving is a mixture of resin binder and aggregate. Clear resin is used to fully coat each aggregate particle before laying. Enough resin is used to allow each aggregate particle to adhere to one another and to the base yet leave voids for water to permeate through. Resin bound paving provides a strong and durable surface that is suitable for pedestrian and vehicular traffic in applications such as pathways, driveways, car parks and access roads. = Stabilized Decomposed Granite = Stabilized decomposed granite is a mixture of a non-resin binder and aggregate (decomposed granite). The binder, which may include color, is mixed with the decomposed granite and the mixture is moistened either before it is put in place or after. Stabilized decomposed granite provides a strong and durable surface that is suitable for pedestrian and vehicular traffic in applications such as pathways, driveways, car parks and access roads. The surface is ADA compliant and can be painted on. = Bound recycled glass porous pavement = Elastomerically bound recycled glass porous pavement consisting of bonding processed post-consumer glass with a mixture of resins, pigments, granite and binding agents. Approximately 75 percent of glass in the U.S. is disposed in landfills.EPA (2009). \\"Municipal Solid Waste Generation, Recycling, and Disposal in the United States: Facts and Figures for 2008.\\" Document no.

The company sells pet food for cats and dogs formulated for puppy/kitten, adult and mature. Its products are developed by nutritionists and veterinarians and can be found in three main formulas: ProActive Health, Healthy Naturals and Premium Protection. Veterinary formulas for pets with special dietary requirements are also available.  History  During the 1940s, because pet food was not available in stores, animals were predominantly fed homemade food, usually table scraps.\\"Iams History\\". Coupon for Dog Paul Iams, an animal nutritionist who graduated from Ohio State University in 1937, founded The Iams Company in 1946 in a small feed mill near Dayton. In 1950, he developed the world‚Äôs first animal-based protein, dry dog food and called it Iams 999. In 1969, Paul Iams formulated a new dog food and named it Eukanuba. Prior to founding Iams and Eukanuba, he worked for a number of companies including his father‚Äôs feed business in Dayton, Ohio. In 1973 during the Arab oil embargo, the costs for meat and bone meal tripled, but sale prices in the US were frozen by a nationwide wage and price control issued by then-President Richard Nixon. Iams did not change the product formula during the price freeze mandate and the company nearly went broke. Clay Mathile, who joined Iams in 1970, purchased half of the company in 1975. By 1982, he became the sole owner and president. After expanding the company from $100,000 revenue in 1970 to $900 million in 1999, Mathile sold it to P&G; in September 1999. In July 2006, P&G; reorganized the Pet Health & Nutrition division into P&G; Pet Care (consisting of the Iams and Eukanuba brands). In its largest divestiture in five years, Procter & Gamble announced in April 2014 that it would sell its Iams, Eukanuba and Natura pet food brands in all markets except Europe to Mars, Incorporated for $2.9 billion in cash. P&G; said the deal would allow it to lose a slow performer and generate cash to grow core businesses. The deal for P&G; Pet Care's operations in North America and Latin America was completed in August 2014. Mars, Inc also exercised options to acquire P&G;‚Äôs pet food business in some parts of Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, including Australia, Japan and Singapore. P&G; sold its European pet care business to Spectrum Brands in December 2014.  Iams Home 4 the Holidays  In 1999, Helen Woodward Animal Center and Iams established Iams Home 4 the Holidays (IH4TH), a holiday pet adoption drive. The drive started with 14 animal rescue organizations in San Diego and has expanded its network to more than 3,500 in 21 different countries. Since it began in 1999, the adoption program has helped place more than 4.6 million pets into homes. In 2008 and 2009, actresses and pet adoption advocates Felicity Huffman and Hilary Swank served as the celebrity ambassadors for the IH4TH program, respectively. In 2010, five million meals were donated to network animal shelters through the IH4TH Bags 4 Bowls program.  Controversy  In 2002, a film by animal rights organizations PETA criticized Iams for the way the company conducted animal research at external laboratories. Iams ended its relationship with the Sinclair Research Center in 2003, stating that the filmed activity was contrary to the company's strict long-standing animal studies policies. According to Iams, since 2006, studies have been conducted in pet owners' homes, P&G; Pet Care's Pet Health & Nutrition Center, and locations where dogs and cats are already living such as assistance dog organizations. This center and these studies are subjected to unannounced examinations by the ASPCA.

Baron Alington was a title that was created three times in British history. The first creation came in the Peerage of Ireland on 28 July 1642 when William Alington was made Baron Alington, of Killard in the County of Cork. His second son, the third Baron (who succeeded in the title on the early death of his elder brother), was a Major-General in the English Army. On 5 December 1682 he was created Baron Alington, of Wymondley in the County of Hertford, in the Peerage of England. The English barony became extinct on the death of his young son Giles, the fourth Baron, in 1691. The late Baron was succeeded in the Irish barony by his uncle, the fifth Baron. He was a captain in the army. On his death in February 1723 the Irish barony became extinct as well. The title was revived on 15 January 1876 when the peer and Conservative politician Henry Sturt was made Baron Alington, of Crichel in the County of Dorset, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was the son of Henry Sturt, great-grandson of Humphrey Sturt by his wife Diana (through which marriage Crichel House in Dorset came into the Sturt family), daughter of Sir Nathaniel Napier, 3rd Baronet, and the Honourable Catherine, daughter of the third Baron of the 1642 creation. Lord Alington was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. He represented Dorset East in Parliament. His eldest son, Captain Hon. Gerard Philip Montagu Napier Sturt (1893‚Äì1918), died on Armistice Day 1918, from wounds received in action, unmarried. Lord Alington was therefore succeeded by his second son, the third Baron. He was a captain in the Royal Air Force. He had no sons and on his death on active service in 1940 the title became extinct. The family seat of Crichel House passed to the late Baron's daughter, the Honourable Mary Anna Sibell Elizabeth Sturt (1929‚Äì2010).

Such models consider many individual components that interact with each other. In MFT, the effect of all the other individuals on any given individual is approximated by a single averaged effect, thus reducing a many-body problem to a one-body problem. The main idea of MFT is to replace all interactions to any one body with an average or effective interaction, sometimes called a molecular field. This reduces any many-body problem into an effective one-body problem. The ease of solving MFT problems means that some insight into the behavior of the system can be obtained at a lower computational cost. MFT has since been applied to a wide range of fields outside of physics, including statistical inference, graphical models, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, epidemic models, queueing theory, computer-network performance and game theory, as in the quantal response equilibrium.  Origins  The ideas first appeared in physics (statistical mechanics) in the work of Pierre Curie and Pierre Weiss to describe phase transitions. MFT has been used in the Bragg‚ÄìWilliams approximation, models on Bethe lattice, Landau theory, Pierre‚ÄìWeiss approximation, Flory‚ÄìHuggins solution theory, and Scheutjens‚ÄìFleer theory. Systems with many (sometimes infinite) degrees of freedom are generally hard to solve exactly or compute in closed, analytic form, except for some simple cases (e.g. certain Gaussian random-field theories, the 1D Ising model). Often combinatorial problems arise that make things like computing the partition function of a system difficult. MFT is an approximation method that often makes the original solvable and open to calculation. Sometimes, MFT gives very accurate approximations. In field theory, the Hamiltonian may be expanded in terms of the magnitude of fluctuations around the mean of the field. In this context, MFT can be viewed as the \\"zeroth-order\\" expansion of the Hamiltonian in fluctuations. Physically, this means that an MFT system has no fluctuations, but this coincides with the idea that one is replacing all interactions with a \\"mean field\\". Quite often, MFT provides a convenient launch point to studying higher-order fluctuations. For example, when computing the partition function, studying the combinatorics of the interaction terms in the Hamiltonian can sometimes at best produce perturbative results or Feynman diagrams that correct the mean-field approximation.  Validity  In general, dimensionality plays a strong role in determining whether a mean-field approach will work for any particular problem. There is sometimes a critical dimension, above which MFT is valid and below which it is not. Heuristically, many interactions are replaced in MFT by one effective interaction. So if the field or particle exhibits many random interactions in the original system, they tend to cancel each other out, so the mean effective interaction and MFT will be more accurate. This is true in cases of high dimensionality, when the Hamiltonian includes long-range forces, or when the particles are extended (e.g. polymers). The Ginzburg criterion is the formal expression of how fluctuations render MFT a poor approximation, often depending upon the number of spatial dimensions in the system of interest. Formal approach (Hamiltonian) The formal basis for mean-field theory is the Bogoliubov inequality. This inequality states that the free energy of a system with Hamiltonian : \\\\mathcal{H} = \\\\mathcal{H}_0 + \\\\Delta \\\\mathcal{H} has the following upper bound: : F \\\\leq F_0 \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\langle \\\\mathcal{H} \\\\rangle_0 - T S_0, where S_0 is the entropy, and F and F_0 are Helmholtz free energies. The average is taken over the equilibrium ensemble of the reference system with Hamiltonian \\\\mathcal{H}_0. In the special case that the reference Hamiltonian is that of a non-interacting system and can thus be written as : \\\\mathcal{H}_0 = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N h_i(\\\\xi_i), where \\\\xi_i are the degrees of freedom of the individual components of our statistical system (atoms, spins and so forth), one can consider sharpening the upper bound by minimizing the right side of the inequality. The minimizing reference system is then the \\"best\\" approximation to the true system using non-correlated degrees of freedom and is known as the mean-field approximation. For the most common case that the target Hamiltonian contains only pairwise interactions, i.e., : \\\\mathcal{H} = \\\\sum_{(i,j) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{P}} V_{i,j}(\\\\xi_i, \\\\xi_j), where \\\\mathcal{P} is the set of pairs that interact, the minimizing procedure can be carried out formally. Define \\\\operatorname{Tr}_i f(\\\\xi_i) as the generalized sum of the observable f over the degrees of freedom of the single component (sum for discrete variables, integrals for continuous ones). The approximating free energy is given by :\\\\begin{align} F_0 &= \\\\operatorname{Tr}_{1,2,\\\\ldots,N} \\\\mathcal{H}(\\\\xi_1, \\\\xi_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\xi_N) P^{(N)}_0(\\\\xi_1, \\\\xi_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\xi_N)  &\\\\+ kT \\\\,\\\\operatorname{Tr}_{1,2,\\\\ldots,N} P^{(N)}_0(\\\\xi_1, \\\\xi_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\xi_N) \\\\log P^{(N)}_0(\\\\xi_1, \\\\xi_2, \\\\ldots,\\\\xi_N), \\\\end{align} where P^{(N)}_0(\\\\xi_1, \\\\xi_2, \\\\dots, \\\\xi_N) is the probability to find the reference system in the state specified by the variables (\\\\xi_1, \\\\xi_2, \\\\dots, \\\\xi_N). This probability is given by the normalized Boltzmann factor : \\\\begin{align} P^{(N)}_0(\\\\xi_1, \\\\xi_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\xi_N) &= \\\\frac{1}{Z^{(N)}_0} e^{-\\\\beta \\\\mathcal{H}_0(\\\\xi_1, \\\\xi_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\xi_N)}  &= \\\\prod_{i=1}^N \\\\frac{1}{Z_0} e^{-\\\\beta h_i(\\\\xi_i)} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\prod_{i=1}^N P^{(i)}_0(\\\\xi_i), \\\\end{align} where Z_0 is the partition function. Thus :\\\\begin{align} F_0 &= \\\\sum_{(i,j) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{P}} \\\\operatorname{Tr}_{i,j} V_{i,j}(\\\\xi_i, \\\\xi_j) P^{(i)}_0(\\\\xi_i) P^{(j)}_0(\\\\xi_j)  &\\\\+ kT \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\operatorname{Tr}_i P^{(i)}_0(\\\\xi_i) \\\\log P^{(i)}_0(\\\\xi_i). \\\\end{align} In order to minimize, we take the derivative with respect to the single-degree-of-freedom probabilities P^{(i)}_0 using a Lagrange multiplier to ensure proper normalization. The end result is the set of self-consistency equations : P^{(i)}_0(\\\\xi_i) = \\\\frac{1}{Z_0} e^{-\\\\beta h_i^{MF}(\\\\xi_i)},\\\\quad i = 1, 2, \\\\ldots, N, where the mean field is given by : h_i^\\\\text{MF}(\\\\xi_i) = \\\\sum_{\\\\\\\\{j \\\\mid (i,j) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{P}\\\\\\\\}} \\\\operatorname{Tr}_j V_{i,j}(\\\\xi_i, \\\\xi_j) P^{(j)}_0(\\\\xi_j). Applications Mean-field theory can be applied to a number of physical systems so as to study phenomena such as phase transitions. =Ising model= Consider the Ising model on a d-dimensional lattice. The Hamiltonian is given by : H = -J \\\\sum_{\\\\langle i, j \\\\rangle} s_i s_j - h \\\\sum_i s_i, where the \\\\sum_{\\\\langle i, j \\\\rangle} indicates summation over the pair of nearest neighbors \\\\langle i, j \\\\rangle, and s_i, s_j = \\\\pm 1 are neighboring Ising spins. Let us transform our spin variable by introducing the fluctuation from its mean value m_i \\\\equiv \\\\langle s_i \\\\rangle. We may rewrite the Hamiltonian as : H = -J \\\\sum_{\\\\langle i, j \\\\rangle} (m_i + \\\\delta s_i) (m_j + \\\\delta s_j) - h \\\\sum_i s_i, where we define \\\\delta s_i \\\\equiv s_i - m_i; this is the fluctuation of the spin. If we expand the right side, we obtain one term that is entirely dependent on the mean values of the spins and independent of the spin configurations. This is the trivial term, which does not affect the statistical properties of the system. The next term is the one involving the product of the mean value of the spin and the fluctuation value. Finally, the last term involves a product of two fluctuation values. The mean- field approximation consists of neglecting this second-order fluctuation term: : H \\\\approx H^\\\\text{MF} \\\\equiv -J \\\\sum_{\\\\langle i, j \\\\rangle} (m_i m_j + m_i \\\\delta s_j + m_j \\\\delta s_i) - h \\\\sum_i s_i. These fluctuations are enhanced at low dimensions, making MFT a better approximation for high dimensions. Again, the summand can be reexpanded. In addition, we expect that the mean value of each spin is site-independent, since the Ising chain is translationally invariant. This yields : H^\\\\text{MF} = -J \\\\sum_{\\\\langle i, j \\\\rangle} \\\\big(m^2 + 2m(s_i - m)\\\\big) - h \\\\sum_i s_i. The summation over neighboring spins can be rewritten as \\\\sum_{\\\\langle i, j \\\\rangle} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_i \\\\sum_{j \\\\in nn(i)}, where nn(i) means \\"nearest neighbor of i\\", and the 1/2 prefactor avoids double counting, since each bond participates in two spins. Simplifying leads to the final expression : H^\\\\text{MF} = \\\\frac{J m^2 N z}{2} - \\\\underbrace{(h + m J z)}_{h^\\\\text{eff.}} \\\\sum_i s_i, where z is the coordination number. At this point, the Ising Hamiltonian has been decoupled into a sum of one-body Hamiltonians with an effective mean field h^\\\\text{eff.} = h + J z m, which is the sum of the external field h and of the mean field induced by the neighboring spins. It is worth noting that this mean field directly depends on the number of nearest neighbors and thus on the dimension of the system (for instance, for a hypercubic lattice of dimension d, z = 2 d). Substituting this Hamiltonian into the partition function and solving the effective 1D problem, we obtain : Z = e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\beta J m^2 Nz}{2}} \\\\left[2 \\\\cosh\\\\left(\\\\frac{h + m J z}{k_\\\\text{B} T}\\\\right)\\\\right]^N, where N is the number of lattice sites. This is a closed and exact expression for the partition function of the system. We may obtain the free energy of the system and calculate critical exponents. In particular, we can obtain the magnetization m as a function of h^\\\\text{eff.}. We thus have two equations between m and h^\\\\text{eff.}, allowing us to determine m as a function of temperature. This leads to the following observation: * For temperatures greater than a certain value T_\\\\text{c}, the only solution is m = 0. The system is paramagnetic. * For T < T_\\\\text{c}, there are two non-zero solutions: m = \\\\pm m_0. The system is ferromagnetic. T_\\\\text{c} is given by the following relation: T_\\\\text{c} = \\\\frac{J z}{k_B}. This shows that MFT can account for the ferromagnetic phase transition. =Application to other systems= Similarly, MFT can be applied to other types of Hamiltonian as in the following cases: * To study the metal‚Äìsuperconductor transition. In this case, the analog of the magnetization is the superconducting gap \\\\Delta. * The molecular field of a liquid crystal that emerges when the Laplacian of the director field is non-zero. * To determine the optimal amino acid side chain packing given a fixed protein backbone in protein structure prediction (see Self-consistent mean field (biology)). * To determine the elastic properties of a composite material. Extension to time-dependent mean fields In mean- field theory, the mean field appearing in the single-site problem is a scalar or vectorial time-independent quantity. However, this need not always be the case: in a variant of mean-field theory called dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), the mean field becomes a time-dependent quantity. For instance, DMFT can be applied to the Hubbard model to study the metal‚ÄìMott-insulator transition.

Until 2012, it was known as the John Labatt Centre. The John Labatt Centre, which opened on October 11, 2002, was named after John Labatt, founder of the Labatt brewery in London. Labatt still has a large brewery in London to the present day, although its head office was moved to Toronto in the early 1990s. The John Labatt Centre's name was changed to Budweiser Gardens (after Labatt's sister brand in AB InBev) in Fall 2012, as approved by London City Council on Tuesday, June 26, 2012 with a vote of 12‚Äì3. The centre was built, in part, to be the new downtown home of London's Ontario Hockey League team, the London Knights, replacing the 40-year-old London Ice House in the south end of the city, near Highway 401. Since 2011, it is home to London's National Basketball League of Canada team, the London Lightning. History =The Talbot Inn= Budweiser Gardens million-dollar facade at its northeast corner is a replica of the Talbot Inn using \\"retumbled\\" yellow brick (new yellow bricks that have been scuffed up and scarred to appear old). The Talbot Inn is a 19th-century building that stood on the site for more than 125 years‚Äîa designated heritage property under the Ontario Heritage Act (facade only via a registered heritage easement). Originally planning to re-use the old bricks from the Talbot Inn on the northeast facade of Budweiser Gardens, the City of London suddenly had the building demolished on the morning of Sunday, June 3, 2001‚Äîwithout a demolition permit or delisting the Talbot Inn's facade as a designated heritage property. Instead, the City of London had previously obtained a \\"heritage alteration permit\\", permits which are routinely used for minor changes to heritage properties, changes that don't affect the by-law reasons for designation. According to officials with the Ontario Heritage Foundation (now called the Ontario Heritage Trust), it is the first known time in Ontario's history and possibly Canada's, that a \\"heritage alteration permit\\" was misused to outright demolish a designated heritage property. The rationale cited by civic officials was that the Talbot Inn bricks were not salvageable due to their moisture content after a contractor had power-washed the paint off the bricks. Some of the original bricks, however, were used for the interior walls of the restaurant on Budweiser Gardens second level and the rest were trucked to TRY Recycling in London where they were re-sold. No charges were ever laid against the City of London under the Ontario Heritage Act for the unusual demolition and the facade of the Talbot Inn remained designated under the Ontario Heritage Act for approximately 17 months after it was demolished. =The \\"Talbot Tot\\"= Prior to the construction of Budweiser Gardens during an archaeological assessment of the property, the skeletal remains of an infant, believed to be from the 1830s or 1840s, were found in the soil at the site. The discovery caused an uproar and delayed construction for a few months and likely contributed to the sudden demolition of the Talbot Inn in 2001. The human remains were dubbed the \\"Talbot Tot\\" and subsequently were reinterred at Oakland (pioneer) Cemetery on Oxford Street West in London. Ownership and management Budweiser Gardens is leased from the City of London by the London Civic Centre Corporation, an example of a public-private partnership. The London Civic Centre Corporation is owned in turn by EllisDon and Global Spectrum, the Philadelphia-based subsidiary of Comcast the American cable company. Global Spectrum also manages the Budweiser Gardens and operates more than 100 other arenas, stadiums and convention centres. Because of this, the Philadelphia Flyers, a corporate cousin of Global Spectrum, customarily have played a preseason game at Budweiser Gardens each year. =Seating and ticketing= Approximate capacities: * 9,046 - Hockey * 9,000 - End stage concert * 3,200 - Theatre mode (smaller concert) * 2,800 - Theatre mode (with proscenium) * 10,200 - Centre stage concert In addition to the standard end stage configuration for large concerts, the arena can be set up to accommodate touring Broadway shows or smaller concerts in its theatre mode. The theatre mode features a small, intimate atmosphere and a 30-line fly grid to suspend scenery or lighting and sound. When the sports-entertainment centre was originally being planned, estimates for sports seating were as low as 6,500 and high as 12,000 before settling on the original 9,090. It was decided due to several smaller arenas in the 4,000 to 7,000 range struggling financially and the cost on construction nearly doubling to have 12,000 or more seats. The sports-entertainment centre features 38 luxury suites and 1,100 club seats. Budweiser Gardens complies with the Ontarians with Disabilities Act and has 55% more public washrooms than required by the law. Cost and construction Budweiser Gardens was built at a cost of approximately $42 million by the London, Ontario-based construction company EllisDon Corp., builders of Toronto's Rogers Centre. The City of London contributed $32 million for arena construction and $10 million to purchase the land, while the London Civic Centre Corporation added $9.5 million to the arena's construction. The sports- entertainment centre was originally named the John Labatt Centre, after the Labatt Brewing Company which has a production plant in London, until 2012 when their 10-year naming rights expired. The Labatt Brewing Company had an exclusive first rights on a second deal and could change the name if they chose, which they did, to Budweiser Gardens to further promote the main brand of their sister corporation, Anheuser-Busch. The original deal was $5-million for 10 years and the deal signed in 2012 was $6.4 million for 10 years. Global Spectrum, which manages the sports-entertainment centre, was selected by the City of London to choose the naming rights and they used a subsidiary called Front Row Marketing. Proceeds from naming rights are put into the net revenue, though the exact divide of the amount going to the City of London and Global Spectrum is unknown. Sporting events Within a few years of opening, the London Knights had a championship season in 2004‚Äì05 and the centre was well positioned to take maximum advantage of the team's popularity. Budweiser Gardens hosted the 2005 Memorial Cup, the CHL championship series which the Knights also won after winning the OHL championship. The arena also hosted the 2014 Memorial Cup in which the Edmonton Oil Kings were champions defeating the Guelph Storm by a score of 6‚Äì3. The University of Western Ontario Mustangs hockey team used Budweiser Gardens as their home arena from 2005 until 2007. They have since moved back to Thompson Arena. In addition to hockey, the arena is used as home play area for the London Lightning professional basketball team. Budweiser Gardens is host to national-level events, such as the 2005 Canadian Figure Skating Championships, the 2006 Scott Tournament of Hearts (curling), the 2007 World Synchronized Skating Championships, 2011 Tim Hortons Brier, as well as a wide variety of family entertainment such as Disney on Ice, the Harlem Globetrotters, Monster Jam and Stars on Ice. It also hosted an international jousting tournament two years in a row, and the World Figure Skating Championships in 2013. The facility, The London Knights and the City of London hosted the 2014 MasterCard Memorial Cup. The arena also hosted on September 22, 2014, a NHL preseason game between the Philadelphia Flyers and the Toronto Maple Leafs. Toronto won, 3‚Äì2, in a shootout. Other events The arena has also hosted many other well known artists and Broadway Shows. Budweiser Gardens was launched as a concert venue with Cher's \\"Living Proof: The Farewell Tour\\" in 2002. The tour returned for an encore performance in 2005. In 2007, Meat Loaf's \\"3 Bats Live\\" DVD from the \\"Seize The Night\\" tour was recorded here. Cirque du Soleil chose Budweiser Gardens to stage its first-ever arena show, a rebuilt production of Saltimbanco. Sting performed during his Symphonicities Tour on July 21, 2010, along with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. In 2010, Budweiser Gardens was awarded as the Canadian Venue of the Year at the Canadian Music and Broadcast Industry Awards. The arena hosted the 2019 Juno Awards on March 17, 2019.

It is named after Wilbur Lucius Cross, a former governor of the state (1931‚Äì1939). Commercial vehicles, trailers, towed vehicles (except as provided in Connecticut state law Section 14.298.240), buses, hearses, and large vehicles are prohibited from using the parkway. The Wilbur Cross Parkway had two toll barriers located in Milford and Wallingford until 1988.  Route description  Traveling north toward Exit 59 and the West Rock Tunnel, dubbed \\"Heroes Tunnel\\" by the Connecticut legislature in 2003 The tunnel is the only route through a natural obstacle in Connecticut The four-lane Wilbur Cross Parkway begins as a direct continuation of the Merritt Parkway at the Sikorsky Bridge over the Housatonic River at the town line between Milford and Stratford. Immediately after is the exit for the Milford Parkway, which connects to the Connecticut Turnpike (I-95) and the Boston Post Road (US 1). The Wilbur Cross Parkway runs northeast through the towns of Milford, Orange, Woodbridge, and New Haven. At the town line between New Haven and Hamden, the parkway passes through the West Rock Tunnel, which was renamed \\"Heroes Tunnel\\" in 2003 by the State of Connecticut to honor first responders. The only road tunnel through a natural obstacle in Connecticut, it is lighted solely using low pressure sodium vapor lamps, rare in the United States. The parkway proceeds north through the towns of Hamden, North Haven, Wallingford, and Meriden. After connecting with I-91 in Meriden, the parkway ends, merging onto North Broad Street (US 5). North of Meriden, Routes 5 and 15 continue as the Berlin Turnpike. Reflecting its history as a toll road, two pairs of service plazas lie opposite one-another along the parkway in Orange and North Haven. All were renovated since 2011, along with six further south on the Merritt Parkway. In addition to gas pumps and an Alltown convenience store at each plaza, they now include Dunkin' Donuts and Subway shops. Prior to the renovations, no fast-food service had been available at any of the plazas. Three abandoned rest areas remain along the Parkway, in Woodbridge, New Haven, and Meriden.  History  The Wilbur Cross Parkway was originally planned in 1937 as route from US 1 in Milford to the Massachusetts state line in Union. The portion of the parkway south of Meriden was built largely as planned. Construction began in 1939 when federal funds were secured. The first section of the parkway to open was the Milford to Orange segment, from the Housatonic River (Exit 54) to Route 34 (Exit 57-58) at the end of 1941. Subsequent construction was delayed by World War II. After the war, two more sections of the parkway opened: the segment from US 5 in Wallingford (Exit 66) to US 5 in Meriden (Exit 68), bypassing the city center opened in 1946; and the segment from Route 10A in Hamden (Exit 61) to US 5 in Wallingford opened in 1947. In 1948, the parkway was designated as part of a new Route 15, connecting New York to Massachusetts. Because the New Haven segment had not yet been completed, motorists were directed to temporarily follow Route 34, US 5, and Route 10A. In November 1949, the New Haven segment, from Exit 57-58 to Exit 61, including the West Rock Tunnel opened. The entire parkway was a toll road when it opened in 1941. Tolls were removed from both the Merritt and Wilbur Cross Parkways in 1988. Exit list Mileposts and exit numbers listed below continue from the Merritt Parkway.

They are located in Southeast Asia, 150 km north of Aceh on Sumatra, and separated from Thailand to the east by the Andaman Sea. Located 1,300 km southeast of the Indian subcontinent, across the Bay of Bengal, they form part of the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India. UNESCO has declared the Great Nicobar Island as one of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves., The International Coordinating Council of UNESCO‚Äôs Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB), added the following new sites to the World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR) http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media- services/multimedia/photos/mab-2013/india/.

They comprise three distinct groups: Northern Group: * Car Nicobar * Battimaly Central Group: * Chowra, Chaura or Sanenyo * Teressa or Luroo * Bompuka or Poahat * Katchal * Camorta * Nancowry or Nancowrie * Trinket * Laouk or \\"Isle of Man\\" * Tillangchong Southern Group (Sambelong): * Great Nicobar (922 km¬≤, largest island of the Nicobars) * Little Nicobar * Kondul Island * Pulo Milo or Pillomilo (Milo Island) * Meroe, Trak, Treis, Menchal, Kabra, Pigeon and Megapod Indira Point () is the southernmost point of Great Nicobar Island and also of India itself, lying about 150 km north of Sumatra, Indonesia. Nature A Nicobar pigeon. While named after the Nicobar Islands, it is also found widely in the Malay Archipelago The Nicobar Islands are part of a great island arc created by the collision of the Indo-Australian Plate with Eurasia. The collision lifted the Himalayas and most of the Indonesian islands, and created a long arc of highlands and islands, which includes the Arakan Yoma range of Burma, the Andaman and Nicobar islands, and the islands off the west coast of Sumatra, including the Banyak Islands and Mentawai Islands. =Ecology= The climate is warm and tropical, with temperatures ranging from 22 to 30 ¬∞C. Rainfall is heavy due to annual monsoons and measures around 3000 to 3800 mm each year. The vegetation of the Nicobars is typically divided into the coastal mangrove forests and the interior evergreen and deciduous tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests. Additionally, several islands contain extensive inland grasslands, though these are thought to result from human intervention. The Nicobar Islands are recognised as a distinct terrestrial ecoregion, the Nicobar Islands rain forests, with many endemic species. As a result of lower sea levels during the ice ages, the Andaman Islands were linked to the Southeast Asian mainland, but it is not believed that the Nicobar Islands ever had a land bridge to the continent. Lower sea levels did link the islands to one another: Great Nicobar and Little Nicobar were linked to each other, and Nancowry, Chaura, Katchall, Trinka, Camorta, and the nearby smaller islands were linked to one another as well. History = Prehistory = Nicobarese people, c. 1870 The Nicobar Islands are believed to have been inhabited for thousands of years. Six indigenous Nicobarese languages are spoken on the islands, which are part of the Austroasiatic language family, which includes Mon, Khmer and Vietnamese languages of Southeast Asia, and the Munda languages of India. An indigenous tribe living at the southern tip of Great Nicobar, called the Shompen, may be of Mesolithic Southeast Asian origin. = Origin of the name = The earliest extant references to the name \\"Nicobar\\" is in the Sri Lankan Pali Buddhist chronicles, the Dipavamsa (c. 3rd or 4th century CE) and the Mahavamsa (c. 4th or 5th century), which state that the children of the followers of the legendary founder of the Sri Lankan Kingdom, Vijaya, landed on Naggadipa (the island of the children, from the Pali nagga meaning 'naked'). The modern name is likely derived from the Chola dynasty name for the islands, Nakkavaram or 'Puup Pii' (literally, \\"naked man\\" in Tamil) which is inscribed on the Thanjavur (Tanjore) inscription of 1050 CE. Marco Polo (12th-13th century) also referred to this island as 'Necuverann'. In the 15th century, Great Nicobar Island was recorded as \\"Cui Lan island\\" (Áø†Ëò≠Â∂º) during the voyages of Zheng He in the Mao Kun map of the Wu Bei Zhi. = Colonial period = The history of organised European colonisation on the islands began with the Danish East India Company in 1754/56. During this time they were administrated from Tranquebar (in continental Danish India) administrated under the name of Frederiks√∏erne; missionaries from the Moravian Church Brethren's settlement in Tranquebar attempted a settlement on Nancowry and died in great numbers from disease; the islands were repeatedly abandoned due to outbreaks of malaria: 1784‚Äì1807/09, 1830‚Äì1834 and finally from 1848 gradually for good. Between 1778 and 1783, William Bolts attempted to establish an Austrian colony on the islands on the mistaken assumption that Denmark‚ÄìNorway had abandoned its claims to the islands. Italy made an attempt at buying the Nicobar Islands from Denmark between 1864 and 1868. The Italian Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Luigi Torelli started a negotiation that looked promising, but failed due to the unexpected end of his office and the . The negotiations were interrupted and never brought up again.Ministero della Guerra, Ufficio Storico, Storia Militare della Colonia Eritrea, Vol. I, Roma 1935, pp. 15-16 Denmark's presence in the islands ended formally on 16 October 1868 when it sold the rights to the Nicobar Islands to Britain, which in 1869 made them part of British India. =World War II= During World War II, the islands were occupied by Japan between 1942 and 1945. The British reoccupied these islands after the Surrender of Japan, as its Territory. =Indian state= Together with the Andaman Islands, they became a union territory of India in 1950.  Water sports  Andaman and Nicobar islands are also known for the various types of water sports available. Water sports include snorkeling, scuba diving, parasailing, under-sea walking and other thrilling sports. Water sports is one main cause of the huge tourist attraction to this place. People can enjoy with their families and prefer to relax or excite themselves. 26 December 2004 tsunami On 26 December 2004, the coast of the Nicobar Islands was devastated by a 10‚Äì15 m high tsunami following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. At least 6,000 people were killed on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands with reports putting the death toll on Katchal Island alone at 4,600. Several islands were heavily damaged with initial reports of islands broken in two or three pieces and coral reefs moved above water. Teressa Island was said to have been split into two pieces and Trinkat Island into three pieces. Some estimates said that the islands were moved as much as 100 feet (30 m) by the earthquake and tilted. Indira Point subsided 4.25 m and the lighthouse there was damaged. World Biosphere Reserve On 31 May 2013 it was reported that Nicobar Islands have been declared as World Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO.

It once stood near the site of Gilmore Field, an early Los Angeles baseball venue predating Dodger Stadium. It was located within sight of both CBS Television City on the southeast corner of Beverly and Fairfax Avenue and the Farmers Market on the northeast corner of Third Street and Fairfax. For over 35 years it was the premier location for indoor public events in Los Angeles. The facility was closed in 1972, beginning 17 years of steady neglect and decay. In 1978, the Pan-Pacific Auditorium was included in the National Register of Historic Places, but eleven years later the sprawling wooden structure was destroyed in a fire. Architectural icon Built by event promoters Phillip and Cliff Henderson and designed by Los Angeles architects Wurdeman & Becket, the Pan-Pacific Auditorium opened to a fanfare of Boy Scout bugles on May 18, 1935 for a 16-day model home exhibition. Noted as one of the finest examples of Streamline Moderne architecture in the United States, the green and white facade faced west, was long and had four stylized towers and flagpoles meant to evoke upswept aircraft fins. The widely known and much photographed facade belied a modest rectilinear wooden structure resembling an overgrown gymnasium inside and out. The auditorium sprawled across and had seating for up to 6,000. Throughout the following 30 years the Pan-Pacific would host the Ice Capades and the Harlem Globetrotters, serve as home to the Los Angeles Monarchs of the Pacific Coast Hockey League along with UCLA ice hockey, UCLA men's basketball, USC men's basketball, professional tennis, car shows, political rallies and circuses. During the 1940s it was used for audience-attended national radio broadcasts and in the 1950s for televised professional wrestling shows. At its height, most major indoor events in Los Angeles were held at the Pan-Pacific. Leopold Stokowski conducted there in 1936, 1950s actress Jeanne Crain was crowned \\"Miss Pan Pacific\\" there in the early 1940s, General Dwight D. Eisenhower spoke to a beyond-capacity crowd of 10,000 in 1952 a month before being elected President of the United States, Elvis Presley performed there in 1957 shortly before he was drafted into the Army and Vice President Richard Nixon addressed a national audience from the Pan-Pacific in November 1960. The building carried on as Los Angeles' primary indoor venue until the 1972 opening of the much larger Los Angeles Convention Center, after which the Pan- Pacific Auditorium was closed. Pan Pacific State Park Sign Pan Pacific Auditorium Sign Pan-Pacific Auditorium in 1985 Decay and fire There were hopes throughout the surrounding Fairfax District towards refurbishing the Pan-Pacific, possibly as an ice rink or cultural center and the parking lot soon became a park. However, the building was neglected for many years and damaged by small fires started by transients. In 1975, the Pan-Pacific made a brief appearance as the entrance to the NBC Studios in Hollywood for the movie Funny Lady. Interest in the building was rekindled somewhat with its 1978 inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. The 1980 release of the movie musical Xanadu brought renewed hopes the building might be saved when the auditorium's facade was used to portray a dilapidated building which became a sparkling, brightly lit roller disco nightclub, but the movie was critically panned and not an economic success. It also appears at the beginning of the 1980 music video for the Barnes & Barnes song \\"Fish Heads\\". Black-and-white film footage of a man with a jet pack flying from left to right in front of the facade was used in the video for the 1981 Devo single, \\"Beautiful World\\". The dilapidated fa√ßade was used in the video for \\"Dancing in the Sheets\\" by Shalamar. Its final appearance was in the 1988 movie Miracle Mile. The auditorium continued to deteriorate throughout the 1980s, mostly owing to neglect. A large loading door on the southeast corner was often forced open, allowing free access to anyone. A fire in May 1983 damaged the northern end. On the evening of May 24, 1989 (six days after the 54th anniversary of its opening), the Pan-Pacific Auditorium was destroyed by a fire, the smoke from which was visible throughout the Los Angeles basin., includes photo of fire Site today The site is now Pan-Pacific Park and has a recreation center, with a scaled-down replica of one of the famous towers, which opened in 2002. Pop culture Entrance to Disney California Adventure, modeled after the Pan-Pacific Auditorium The facade of the building was used in the motion picture Xanadu, in which a muse (a daughter of Zeus) convinces two men to convert the classic but decaying building into a music and entertainment venue. Through special effects, the building is transformed to outshine the building in its heyday. The video for \\"She's My Girl\\" by The Babys featured the band playing in front of, as well as on top of the building and its iconic flagpole facades. Similarly, The Producers' 1982 music video \\"She Sheila\\" was partly filmed in front of the facade. The 1984 motion picture Ghost Warrior, in which a deep-frozen 400-year-old samurai is shipped to Los Angeles, where he comes back to life, includes scenes of both the seriously decayed facade and the dimly lit interior. In the interior shots, the columns with angled knee bracing and the distinctive arched bowstring trusses are briefly visible. The music video for the 1988 song \\"Going Back to Cali\\" by LL Cool J has a black and white photograph of the building in the opening sequence. A nearly full-scale, stylized replica of the facade opened as the main entrance to Disney's Hollywood Studios theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida on May 1, 1989, just three weeks before the original was destroyed by fire. Disney California Adventure Park, at the Disneyland Resort, opened new entrance gates in the style of the Pan-Pacific's facade on July 15, 2011.

It is located between the insula laterally and the putamen medially, separated by the extreme and external capsules respectively. The blood supply to the claustrum is fulfilled via the middle cerebral artery. It is considered to be the most densely connected structure in the brain, allowing for integration of various cortical inputs (e.g., colour, sound and touch) into one experience rather than singular events. The claustrum is difficult to study given the limited number of individuals with claustral lesions and the poor resolution of neuroimaging. The claustrum is made up of various cell types differing in size, shape and neurochemical composition. Five cell types exist, and a majority of these cells resemble pyramidal neurons found in the cortex. Within the claustrum, there is no organization of cell types compared to the cortex, and the somas of the cells can be a pyramidal, fusiform or circular shape. The principal cell type found in the claustrum is type 1 cells, which are large cells covered in spiny dendrites. The claustrum usually connects to the cortex in an ipsilateral manner; however, the few that travel contralaterally are considerably weaker than the former. The claustrum acts as a conductor for inputs from the cortical regions so these respective areas do not become unsynchronized. Without the claustrum, one could respond to stimuli that are familiar to the individual but not to complex events. Additionally, the claustrum is essential in combining sensory and motor modalities so that various anatomical patterns are present. One of the proposed functions of the claustrum is to differentiate between relevant and irrelevant information so that the latter can be ignored. Cortical components of consciousness include the fronto-parietal cortex, cingulate and precuneus. Due to the claustrum's widespread connectivity to these areas, it is suggested that it may play a role in both attention and consciousness. The neural networks that mediate sustained attention and consciousness implicate numerous cortical areas, many of which overlap in connectivity with the claustrum. Previous clinical reports suggest that conscious processes are lateralized to the left hemisphere in humans.  Structure  The claustrum is a small bilateral gray matter structure (comprising roughly 0.25% of the cerebral cortex) located deep to the insular cortex and extreme capsule, and superficial to the external capsule and basal ganglia. As mentioned, its name means ‚Äúhidden or shut away‚Äù and was first identified in 1672, with more detailed descriptions coming later on during the 19th century. Although the regional neuroanatomical boundaries of the claustrum have been defined, there remains a lack of consensus in the literature when defining its precise margins. = Connections = Despite this long history of reports on the claustrum, descriptions of its overall connectivity have been sparse. However, recent work has suggested that this mysterious structure is present in all mammals, with extensive connections to cortical and subcortical regions. More specifically, electrophysiological studies show extensive connections to thalamic nuclei and the basal ganglia, while isotopological reports have linked the claustrum with the prefrontal, frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital cortices. Additional studies have also looked at the relationship of the claustrum to well-described subcortical white matter tracts. Structures such as the corona radiata, occipital-frontal fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus project to the claustrum from frontal, pericentral, parietal and occipital regions. Reciprocal connections also exist with motor, somatosensory, auditory and visual cortical regions. Altogether, these findings leave the claustrum as the most highly connected structure per regional volume in the brain and suggest that it may serve as a hub to coordinate activity of cerebral circuits. Interestingly, even with this extensive connectivity, most projections to and from the claustrum are ipsilateral (although there are still contralateral projections), and little evidence exists to describe its afferent or efferent connections with the brainstem and spinal cord. In summary, the cortical and subcortical connectivity of the claustrum implies that it is most involved with processing sensory information, as well as the physical and emotional state of an animal. = Microanatomy = Inputs to the claustrum are organized by modality, which include visual, auditory and somatomotor processing areas. In the same way that the morphology of neurons in the spinal cord is indicative of function (i.e. rexed laminae), the visual, auditory and somatomotor regions within the claustrum share similar neurons with specific functional characteristics. For example, the portion of the claustrum that processes visual information (primarily synthesizing afferent fibers concerned with our peripheral visual field) is comprised by a majority of binocular cells that have ‚Äúelongated receptive fields and no orientation selectivity. This focus on peripheral sensory system is not an isolated occurrence, as most sensory afferents entering the claustrum bring peripheral sensory information. Moreover, the claustrum possesses a distinct topological organization for each sensory modality. For example, there is a retinotopic organization within the visual processing area of the claustrum that mirrors that of visual association cortices and V1, in a similar (yet less complicated) manner to the retinotopic conservation within the lateral geniculate nucleus. = Neurons = The claustrum is made up of various cell types that differ in size, shape and neurochemical composition. Five types of cells exist and the majority of these cells are structurally similar to pyramidal neurons found in the cortex. Within the claustrum, the somas of the cells can be found with a pyramidal, fusiform or circular shape. The principal cell type found in the claustrum is Type 1 cells, which are large neurons covered in spiny dendrites. These cells receive inputs from the cortex, and their axons will then leave in a medial or lateral fashion and send reciprocal projections back to the cortex. GABAergic interneurons represent only 10%-15% of the neurons within the claustrum. Finally, many studies show that the claustrum is best distinguished structurally by its prominent plexus of parvalbumin-positive fibers formed by local interneurons.  Function  The claustrum has been shown to have widespread activity to numerous cortical components, all of which have been associated with having components of consciousness and sustained attention. This is because of widespread connectivity to fronto-parietal areas, cingulate cortex, and thalami. Sustained attention is from the connections to the cingulate cortex, temporal cortex, and thalamus. Crick and Koch suggest that the claustrum has a role similar to that of a conductor within an orchestra as it attempts to co-ordinate the function of all connections. This ‚Äúconductor‚Äù analogy can also be supported through connections between the claustral, sensory, and frontal regions. The claustrum has been confirmed to be reciprocally connected to the prefrontal cortex, visual, auditory, sensory, and motor regions respectively. Connections to these modalities provide insight into the functionality of the claustrum. Here it is proposed that the claustrum functions in the gating of selective attention. Through this gating process the claustrum can selectively control input from these modalities to facilitate the process of ‚Äúfocusing‚Äù. It has also been suggested that it operates in the opposite context; that through divisive normalization the claustrum may implement resistance to certain input modalities to prevent ‚Äúdistraction‚Äù. = Potential function = The claustrum, in order to facilitate consciousness, would need to integrate various sensory and motor modalities from various parts of the cortex. The anatomical connections of the claustrum have been observed using DTI (diffusion tensor imaging). An fMRI scan looks at oxygenated blood levels in the brain as a way of observing the activity of specific cortical areas. fMRI scans show dampened activity when anesthetized versus awake in rats, specifically claustrum connections to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the mediodorsol thalamus (MD thalamus). The claustrum is connected with the contralateral hemispheres claustrum with strong and functional connections. Connections with MD thalamaus, mPFC, and surrounding and distant cortical areas also exist. Electrical stimulation in the dorsal claustrum of cats elicits excitatory responses within the visual cortex. The claustrum is situated anatomically at the confluence of a large number of white-matter tracts used to connected different parts of the cortex. This further suggests an integration center role for these different modalities, such as sensory and motor. Gap junctions have been shown to exist between aspiny interneurons of the claustrum ‚Äì suggesting a role in its ability to synchronize these modalities as input is received. =Attention= The claustrum has the differential ability to select between task relevant information and task irrelevant information to provide directed attention. It contains the highest density of connecting white matter tracts in the cortex. This supports the notion of networking and coordination among different regions of the brain. The claustrum has regional specificity to it; information coming in from visual centers project to specific areas of grey matter neurons in the structure and the auditory cortex. Unexpected stimuli also activate the claustrum, effecting an immediate focusing or allocation of function. In lower mammals (e.g. rats), claustral regions receive input from somatosensory modalities, such as whiskers' motor control perspective because of its sensory and discriminatory use in these mammals. Functionally, it is proposed that it segregates attention between these modalities. Attention itself has been considered as top-down processing or bottom-up processing; both fit contextually with what is observed in the claustrum structurally and functionally, supporting the notion that interactions occur with high-order sensory areas involved in encoding objects and features. Input from the prefrontal cortex, for example, will define attention based upon higher- cognitive task driven behaviour. Moreover, induction of electrical stimulation to the claustrum has been shown to cause inhibition reading, a blank stare, and unresponsiveness. It has been reported that the claustrum has a basal frequency firing that is modulated to increase or decrease with directed attention. For example, projections to motor and occulomotor areas would assist with gaze movement to direct attention to new stimuli by increasing the firing frequency of claustral neurons. Salvinorin A, the active hallucinogenic compound found in Salvia Divinorum, is capable of inducing loss of awareness. Consumption of salvinorin A can induce synesthesia, in which different sensory modalities are interpreted by different sensory cortices. (For example: seeing sounds, tasting colours.) This supports the idea of intrathalamic segregation and conduction (attention). The claustrum has Kappa Opioid Receptors to which Salvinorin A binds, eliciting this effect. = Empirical evidence = High frequency stimulation (HFS) in cat claustrum(s) has the capability to induce autonomic changes and induce ‚Äúinactivation syndrome‚Äù. This syndrome is described as a decrease in awareness, indicating the relationship between the claustrum and consciousness. In humans this same effect can be observed. Stimulation of the left claustrum in humans has produced 'a complete arrest of volitional behavior, unresponsiveness, and amnesia without negative motor symptoms or mere aphasia' suggesting the involvement in consciousness. Furthermore, MRI studies have shown that increased signal intensity with the claustrum has been associated with status epilepticus ‚Äì a condition in which epileptic seizures follow one another without recovery of consciousness in- between events. As well, increased signal intensity is associated with Focal dyscognitive seizures, which are seizures that elicit impairment of awareness or consciousness without convulsions. The individual becomes unaware of his or her environment, and the seizure will manifest as a blank or empty stare for a window of time. Using an operant conditioning task combined with HFS of the claustrum resulted in significant behavioural changes of rats; this included modulated motor responses, inactivity and decreased responsiveness. Beyond this, studies have also shown that the claustrum is active during REM sleep, alongside other structures such as the dentate gyrus. These have associative roles in spatial memory, suggesting that some form of memory consolidation takes place in these areas. = Lesions and consciousness = Functionally, the claustrum will integrate various cortical inputs through its connections into consciousness. Based upon its structure and connectivity, its function is suggested to do with coordination of different brain function; i.e. the conductor analogy. Consciousness functionally can be divided into two components: (i) wakefulness, which is arousal and alertness; (ii) content of consciousness, which is the processing of content. A study of traumatic brain injuries in war veterans was undertaken to better understand the functional role of the claustrum. Damage to the claustrum was associated with duration of loss of consciousness, but not frequency. Lesion size was correlated with greater duration of LOC events. Interestingly, no consequences were shown to attenuate cognitive processing. In a single case-study, consciousness was shown to be disrupted when there was stimulation to the extreme capsule of the brain ‚Äì is in close proximity to the claustrum ‚Äì such that upon termination of stimulation, consciousness was regained. Another study looking at the symptomology of schizophrenia established that the severity of delusions was associated with decreased grey matter volume of the left claustrum; postulating that correlations exist between the structure and positive symptoms seen in this psychiatric disorder. Further supporting this correlation between schizophrenia and the claustrum is that there is an increase in white matter volume entering the claustrum. Inverse correlations between grey matter volume, and severity of hallucinations in the context of auditory hallucinations of schizophrenia has been supported. As well, to see the total loss of function of the claustrum, lesions to both claustrums on each hemisphere would need to occur. However, a recent study consisting of electrical stimulation of the claustrum found no disruption of consciousness in any of the five patients that were subjected to the analysis. The tested patients reported subjective experiences in various sensory domains and exhibited reflexive movement, but none of them displayed loss of consciousness, thus questioning the claustrum's ability to disrupt consciousness when stimulated electrically.  Clinical significance  =Schizophrenia= Damage to the claustrum can lead to various common diseases or mental disorders; delayed development of the structure leads to autism. The claustrum may be involved in schizophrenia as findings show an increase in positive symptoms, such as delusions, when the grey matter volume of the left claustrum and right insula is decreased. Epilepticus with Claustrum Damagealt= =Epilepsy= The claustrum is also seen to play a role in epilepsy; MRIs have found increased claustral signal intensity in those that have been diagnosed with epilepsy. In certain cases, seizures tend to appear to originate from the claustrum when they are involved in early kainic acid induced seizures. =Consciousness= A single case-study showed that consciousness was disrupted when the area between the insula and claustrum was electrically stimulated; consciousness was regained when stimulation stopped. Patients that had a lesion in their left claustrum were more likely to experience a loss of consciousness compared to those that presented with lesions outside of the claustrum. For example, a patient that was subjected to electrode stimulation at the claustrum stopped reading, stared blankly and was unresponsive. Once the electrode was removed, the patient resumed reading and could not remember the events of being dazed. A 2019 study consisting of electrical stimulation of the claustrum found no disruption of consciousness in any of the five patients that were subjected to the analysis. The tested patients reported subjective experiences in various sensory domains and exhibited reflexive movement, but none of them displayed loss of consciousness, thus questioning the claustrum's ability to disrupt consciousness when stimulated electrically. A 2020 study involving artificial activation of the claustrum by optogenetic light stimulation silenced brain activity across the cortex, a phenomenon known as a \\"Down state,\\" which can be seen when mice are sleeping or resting awake (quiet wakefulness). The authors state that 'The claustrum is a coordinator of global slow-wave activity, and it is so exciting that we are getting closer to linking specific brain connections and actions with the ultimate puzzle of consciousness.' =Parkinsonism= A team of investigators led by neuroscientists at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center has identified the claustrum as the likely origin of parkinsonism across different conditions. The team used a novel methodology called lesion network mapping to discover the origins of parkinsonism in 29 patients whose symptoms were not the result of Parkinson‚Äôs disease but rather attributed to a brain lesion ‚Äì an abnormality or injury to the brain visible on brain imaging. The mapping of the 29 lesions ‚Äì which were located in different regions of the brain ‚Äì revealed that connectivity to the claustrum was the single most sensitive and specific marker of lesion-induced parkinsonism.  Other animals  In animals, through tract tracing, findings have shown that the claustrum has extensive connections throughout the cortex with sensory and motor regions along with the hippocampus. A variety of animal models have been used such as cats, rodents and monkeys. Anatomy of a cat brain =Cats= In cats, high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the claustrum can alter motor activity, induce autonomic changes, and precipitate an ‚Äúinactivation syndrome‚Äù described as ‚Äúdecreased awareness\\". Recordings, primarily in cats and primates, show that claustral neurons respond to sensory stimuli and during voluntary movements. Mapping from visual cortex to claustrum includes just a single map, which includes V1 and three other visual areas. Cells in the V1 are part of layer 6, which different from cells that go to the lateral geniculate nucleus; these cells use glutamate as their neurotransmitter. The cat claustrum has 3 defined zones: (1) the anterior dorsal zone, which connects to the motor and somatosensory cortex, (2) the posterior dorsal zone that has connections to the visual cortex and (3) a third zone that is ventral to visual one and connects to the auditory areas. Sensory input is segregated based on modalities and there is a high preference for peripheral sensory information. In the cat, input is received from various visual cortical areas and projects back to the area. These loops are retinotopical, meaning that regions getting visual input are responsible for the same region in the visual field as the area of the cortex that projects to the claustrum. The visual claustrum is a single map of contralateral visual hemifield, receiving information based on motion in the visual field's periphery and has no real selectivity. In terms of somatosensation, claustral neurons will receive whisker motor innervations. They then project back to the whisker motor and somatosensory cortex. This cortical-claustral-cortical circuit plays a role in whisker movements for orientation and palpation. Dynamics of place boundary and object encoding in alt= =Rodents= In rats, motor whisker areas receive input from the ipsilateral claustrum but will then project to the contralateral claustrum. The sensory barrel cortex and primary visual cortex also receive input from the ipsilateral claustrum but send very few projection back to the claustrum. Studies therefore indicate distinct patterning of connectivity of claustrum with different cortical areas. These suggest, rather than a diffuse role, they play specialized roles in cortical processing. In mice, parvalbumin fibres are highly interconnected by chemical and electrical synapses. They are additionally also highly interconnected with claustrocortical neurons ‚Äì suggesting that these inhibitory interneurons strongly modulate their activity. These local networks suggest to synchronize activity of claustrocortical projections to therefore influence brain rhythms and co-ordinated activity of different cortical brain regions. There are additional classes of inhibitory interneurons with local connections within the claustrocortical neurons. Recent experiments in mice monitoring claustrocortical axonal activity to changing visual stimuli suggest the claustrum signals stimulus changes. Interestingly although claustrocortical input to visual cortical areas were engaged, the strongest responses measured were in higher-order regions of the cortex, this included the anterior cingulate cortex which is densely innervated by claustral projection. =Monkeys= In the monkey, there are widespread connections of the claustrum with allocortical and neocortical regions. These connections project towards the frontal lobe, visual cortical regions, temporal cortex, parieto-occipital cortex and somatosensory areas amongst others. The subcortical areas receiving projections are the amygdala, caudate nucleus and hippocampus. It is unknown if there are cortical regions that do not receive input from the claustrum. Additionally, large or small types of aspiny are reported in the monkey brain, which are classified as ‚Äúlocal circuit neurons\\". The dorsal claustrum has bi- directional connections with motor structures in the cortex. The relationship between animal's movement and how neurons in the dorsocaudal claustrum behaves are as follows: 70% of movement neurons are non-selective and can fire to do any push, pulls or turn movements in the forelimb, the rest were more discerning and did only one of the three movements listed above.

The series takes place in the \\"Toward Stars Era\\" universe in which spacecraft are capable of traveling faster than the speed of light. The plot follows protagonist Gene Starwind and his motley crew of an inherited ship dubbed the Outlaw Star, as they search for a legendary, outer space treasure trove called the \\"Galactic Leyline\\". Outlaw Star was originally serialized in the monthly Shueisha magazine Ultra Jump between 1996 and 1999 for a total of 21 chapters. Three volumes of collected chapters were published in Japan between August 1997 and January 1999. Although no official English version of the manga exists, it has been published in Chinese, German, Italian, and Spanish. Sunrise produced a 26-episode anime adaptation that was directed by Mitsuru Hongo and aired on the Japanese station TV Tokyo in early 1998. The animated series has since been translated and broadcast worldwide. This includes an English version from Bandai Entertainment that received an edited airing on the North American Cartoon Network blocks Toonami in early 2001 and later on Adult Swim in early 2002. Outlaw Star has been licensed for release in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment and in Europe by Beez Entertainment. A few Japanese- exclusive audio CDs and light novels have been spawned since the start of the manga's publication. Critical reception for Outlaw Star has been mostly positive. Many reviewers praised the anime series, particularly its animation style and its balance of dramatic and comedic elements. However, some found fault with the show's pacing, believing that the storyline quality begins to wane after the first few episodes. Sunrise produced a spin-off television series titled , which aired in Japan in 1999. Preliminary plans were made to create a direct sequel in the form of a single-episode (OVA) called Sword of Wind, but production never began. Plot Outlaw Star is a space opera/space Western set in the fictional universe. During its past, an asteroid containing a material known as \\"dragonite\\" crashed in the fictional Arashon desert of northern China. Scientists found that the dragonite contained properties related to \\"ether\\", an energy source that would allow spacecraft to travel faster than the speed of light, and thus traverse large distances of the universe in a short time. As new colonies were formed throughout the vast reaches of outer space, pirates, assassins, and outlaws began to threaten humanity's new frontier. To create order, the Earth Federation established four empires: USSA, Einhorn, Piotr, and Tenpa. However, internal power struggles within the factions and conflicts amongst one another become abundant, leading to inevitable lawlessness. The storyline starts shortly after an infamous outlaw named \\"Hot Ice\\" Hilda flees from the Kei Pirates, a branch of the Tin'Pa. Hilda has stolen from them a highly-advanced prototype ship dubbed the XGP15A-II and a suitcase containing a bio-android called Melfina, the only being capable of interfacing with the ship. Outlaw Star opens on the backwater planet Sentinel III, on which the protagonist Gene Starwind and his 11-year-old business associate James \\"Jim\\" Hawking run a small jack-of-all-trades business. After the two take a job as bodyguards for a disguised Hilda and engage in a brief skirmish with the Kei Pirates, Gene and Jim find themselves the owners of the XGP15A-II (which they nickname the \\"Outlaw Star\\") and the caretakers of Melfina, though Hilda is killed in the process. Hilda reveals that the ship's true purpose is to locate the , a place which popular claims say is a holder of immense treasure, knowledge, and power. Throughout the course of the series, the crew grows to include the kimono-garbed contract killer \\"Twilight\\" Suzuka and the Ctarl-Ctarl alien catgirl Aisha Clanclan. The Outlaw Star manga series and animated television series are paced differently. The anime episodes often involve Gene and his comrades taking on various jobs or missions to fund their ship's massive maintenance costs. Throughout their travels, the crew often encounters Ronald MacDougall and Harry MacDougall, a pair of bounty hunters responsible for the death of Gene's father. Ronald acts as a rival to Gene, while Harry wishes to form a bond with Melfina, a bio-android like himself, who instead develops strong feelings for Gene. The crew also contends with others that learn of the Outlaw Star's connection to the Galactic Leyline. They are Nguyen Khan, a scientist wishing to gain omniscience through the Leyline; and Lord Hazanko, the leader of the ruthless assassin organization the Anten Seven that seek the Leyline to gain ultimate power. The series climaxes when all parties meet on the physical plane of the Leyline. In the end, Ron MacDougall retreats, saved by a computer copy of his brother Harry (who is killed trying to protect Melfina from Hazanko), Khan is integrated into the Leyline as data, Gene reveals to Melfina that he is in love with her and frees her from the Leyline by making it their shared wish to be together forever, and Hazanko is eventually defeated by the Outlaw Star crewmembers. Once the conflict comes to a close, Gene and his friends return to Sentinel III and go their separate ways, but ultimately reunite to continue their adventures together. Production Outlaw Star was created by Morning Star Studio. Takehiko It≈ç was the manga's director, writer, and chief artist. It≈ç was aided in his duties by Hajime Yatate, a pseudonym of writers at Sunrise. Others who contributed to the work include producer Kenzoh Tomita; starship designer Shoji Kawamori; character concept and imageboard illustrators Yutaka Minowa and Hajime Jinguji; and a team of production designers and assistant artists. Outlaw Star takes place in the Toward Stars Era, the same universe as It≈ç's , a pulp-science fiction manga that was first serialized by Kadokawa Shoten in 1988. It≈ç has described this earlier work as \\"something out of boy's dream\\" and took a much more mature, scientific approach when writing Outlaw Star. The author also referenced aspects of Chinese culture when creating Outlaw Star. The animated television series of Outlaw Star was produced by Sunrise and directed by Mitsuru Hongo, whose previous credits include the comedy Crayon Shin-chan and the magical girl series Shamanic Princess. The script was chiefly written by , who wrote about three-quarters of the episodes. Character designs were handled by Hiroyuki Hataike (Detonator Orgun, Armored Trooper Votoms) and Takuya Saito. The show's vehicles were designed by and Macross and Gundam mecha artist Sh≈çji Kawamori, the latter of whom designed the Outlaw Star ship itself. Kow Otani composed the musical score for the Outlaw Star anime. The series features the opening theme \\"Through the Night\\" written and performed Masahiko Arimachi, and two closing themes, and , both written and performed by Akino Arai. \\"Through the Night\\" was chosen for the opening among several candidate songs. It≈ç and Sunrise agreed that the theme should be one that had not been used in a recent animation and that it should feature male vocals. Arimachi wrote the song to resemble a story, took into account its long-term impact, and felt it fit Outlaw Star perfectly. Media =Manga= Outlaw Star was serialized in Japan's monthly Shueisha magazine Ultra Jump between 1996 and 1999. A total of 21 chapters were published, and 17 of these chapters were compiled among three tank≈çbon (collected volumes), released in Japan from August 1997 to January 1999. Each volume also contains information on the series' universe; detailed spaceship and planet descriptions; and character profiles. A Chinese version of the manga was published in Hong Kong by Sharp Point Press. The series has also been published in German and Italian by Planet Manga. No official English translation of the Outlaw Star exists, though Morning Star Studio's official website suggests that a release in the United States was planned at one time. =Anime= Outlaw Star was edited by Cartoon Network (bottom) to cover up instances of nudity featured in the Japanese version (top). The 26-episode anime adaptation of Outlaw Star began broadcasting in Japan on TV Tokyo from January 8, 1998 and ended on June 25, 1998, though the broadcast began on January 9, as it was in a 1:15 A.M. time slot. The series was licensed by Bandai Entertainment The English version was produced by ZRO Limit Productions and was aired on the evening Toonami block beginning on January 15, 2001 and ended on February 21, 2001. This broadcast of the show was heavily edited due to its adult content. Profanity was removed, scenes with violence and lewd behavior were cut or toned down, and many scenes containing nudity were altered by digitally inserting clothing onto characters. Episode 23, in which the Outlaw Star crew visits a hot spring planet, was not aired due to nudity and suggestive themes. However, some instances of adult language were not removed for the anime's initial run. Toonami's creative director Sean Akins claimed that Cartoon Network made all of their own edits to their licensed properties during this time period, which they did \\"in a way that preserves the story\\". The role of Fred Luo, a recurring homosexual character, was considerably toned down. Cartoon Network had no specific editing policy with regard to gay characters, but that \\"overt sexuality or implied sexuality of any kind are not allowed\\". Outlaw Star was also aired on the late night Adult Swim block throughout 2002. However, the broadcast was cancelled late in the year and (according to Akins) the network allowed its rights to the anime to expire by 2003. Outlaw Star was aired in the United Kingdom on CNX in October 2002. Bandai released the first 13 episodes of Outlaw Star on DVD in Japan on August 25, 1999, and the remaining 13 episodes on November 25, 1999. A Japanese \\"remastered\\" DVD boxset containing the entire series was published by Bandai on September 22, 2006. Yet another DVD boxset, Emotion the Best: Seih≈ç Buky≈ç Outlaw Star, was released in Japan on September 24, 2010. Bandai released the series in North America in three DVD collections on September 1, 2000, February 14, 2001, and March 6, 2001. The Outlaw Star Perfect Collection Box Set, a DVD compilation of the entire series, was released on September 10, 2002. The series was again re-released on March 28, 2006 as the Outlaw Star Complete Collection. Outlaw Star additionally received DVD releases in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment on June 23, 2004, and in the United Kingdom by Beez Entertainment on April 25, 2011. Following the closure of Beez, the show was re-licensed by Anime Limited who will re-release the series in 2013. At Otakon 2013, Funimation and Sunrise had announced that they have rescued Outlaw Star, along with a handful of other former BEI titles. In October 2014,https://bvc.bandaivisual.co.jp/special/010_outlawstar/index.htmlhttp://www.sunrise- inc.co.jp/seihou/OUTLAW-STAR/bdbox.html the entire series was released in Japan for the first time on Blu-Ray, with the set including such features as staff commentary, an art gallery board, book breaks of Gene and Melfina, and various songs.https://www.amazon.co.jp/ÊòüÊñπÊ≠¶‰æ†„Ç¢„Ç¶„Éà„É≠„Éº„Çπ„Çø„Éº-COMPLETE-Blu-ray-BOX- Ê∏ãË∞∑ËåÇ/dp/B00KHKWL7S On March 16, 2017, Funimation announcedhttps://www.funimation.com/blog/2017/03/16/june-2017-blu-ray-and-dvd- releases/ that Outlaw Star would be released in North America in both standard and Collector's Editions on June 13, 2017. Each edition includes a DVD and Blu-ray copy of the series, while the Collector's Edition comes in a metallic chipboard artbox designed after the XGP-15A2 and includes a 100-page artbook. Following Funimation's acquisition of the series, it aired again on Cartoon Network as part of Adult Swim on the Toonami programming block starting on Saturday August 19, 2017 and concluding on March 17, 2018. Due to its late night broadcast on Adult Swim, the anime was aired with much fewer edits and included the TV premiere of episode 23.Toonami to Air Outlaw Star Anime =CDs= The opening theme and the two closing themes of Outlaw Star were published in Japan in 1998 as CD singles by Victor Entertainment and JVC respectively. Victor Entertainment published a two-volume original soundtrack for the series on March 31, 1998, and June 24, 1998. The CDs consist of a total of 61 background and vocal music tracks. Another two-disc album containing several drama tracks, , was released on August 21, 1998. =Light novels= A series of light novels based on Outlaw Star has been released in Japan by Shueisha under its Super Dash Bunko label. , was written by Katsuhiko Tiba (ÂçÉËëâ ÂÖãÂΩ¶ Chiba Katsuhiko), illustrated by Takuya Saitou (ÊñéËó§ Âçì‰πü Sait≈ç Takuya), and released in two volumes on October 1998 and February 1999. The two books are an adaptation of the anime series, retelling the early events that trigger Gene and company's search for the Galactic Leyline. Another light novel, , was written by Miho Sakai, illustrated by Takuya Saitou, and released as a single volume on July 14, 2000. The novel features an original plot involving the Outlaw Star crew pursuing a serial killer named Billy McAglen in a mining town called El Dorado. =Other merchandise= A hardcover guidebook titled was published by Fujimi Shobo as part of its Dragon Magazine imprint in November 1998. The guide contains summaries of the manga and anime, character profiles, sketches, animation cels, and interviews with the production staff. In 2001, Bandai released an Outlaw Star action figure set as part of a line based on its licensed anime franchises. The set contains the Outlaw Star ship and the characters Gene and Melfina. Asako Nishida, one of the show's animation directors, compiled her contributions to the Toward Stars Era franchise in a 2009 art book. Reception Critical reception for Outlaw Star has been favorable. Eric Luce, Ivevei Upatkoon, and Michael Poirier of EX.org all gave similarly positive reviews for the Japanese manga, Japanese anime, and English anime versions of Outlaw Star respectively. Luce was complimentary of the manga's \\"raw\\" yet \\"good and distinctive\\" artwork, detailed backgrounds, and good placement of characters among one another. However, he was annoyed that all the women have \\"disturbing tendency to all have the same silicone stiffened chests\\" and that characters typically wear mad grins. Upatkoon found the artwork of the anime version to be good, and he particularly enjoyed the opening sequence, but took issue with the occasionally inconsistent character designs. He also appreciated the show's dichotomy between serious and humorous subject matter, shown by the titular ship in its grappler mode and how it communicates with the crew. Poirier found the main protagonist Gene to be the anime's best characterization: \\"Gene Starwind is a sly, sharp-shooting hero whose success with his gun (and with the ladies) is matched only by his propensity to get space-sick. Imagine that: the star of a space-faring series has to continually worry about vomiting onto his control panel. This sort of ironic comedy can be found throughout Outlaw Star, creating excellent segues between the fantastic action sequences and the delightful characters.\\" Poirier was intrigued by its other characters as well, and was impressed by the \\"sharp but fluid\\" animation style and the spaceship designs. Mania.com's David Owens appreciated the artistic style specifically for the characters, nearly all of which he incidentally found likeable. Jacob Churosh of THEM Anime Reviews additionally noted high animation quality throughout. Although he proclaimed the vehicle designs of Outlaw Star to be superb, Protoculture Addicts writer Martin Ouellette judged the animation and character designs to be \\"less lucky\\" and lacking in \\"the special aura\\" of Sunrise's acclaimed 1998 series Cowboy Bebop. Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy, authors of The Anime Encyclopedia agreeably denoted Outlaw Star as \\"no competition for Cowboy Bebop in terms of style, content, or execution\\". Critical reception for the plot of Outlaw Star has been mixed. Churosh found that though the series features many clich√©s of 1990's science fiction anime, Outlaw Star manages to transcend them as well. \\"Maybe it doesn't go anywhere that other series haven't already been\\", the reviewer stated. \\"But boy, does it have a damn good time getting there.\\" Upatkoon observed that the plot \\"[takes] off with a bang at the beginning\\" and then begins to drag. Keith Dawe of Animerica also noted this about the anime's pacing, stating that even as the first few episodes do well to begin the narrative, the show's writers rely too heavily on inertia to advance it. He went on to remark that the series suffers from \\"unfocused scripting\\" and that \\"one has to endure the occasional cheesy episode to reap the rewards of a show that is clever, pragmatic and amusing\\". However, Dawe did regard the English script writing and voice acting, and called the over-the-top introductory narration for each episode a reminder that the show should be enjoyed for what it was. Owens commented that the plot will not seem very original, but that it does seem to have direction, despite said direction not being very clear. Outlaw Star has received very modest commercial success and miscellaneous viewer recognition. The initial shipment of the manga's first volume sold out nationwide in Japan. According to Morning Star Studio's English website, the Outlaw Star manga has sold 250,000 copies, though the anime series was less successful. The Outlaw Star television series was aired in Japan during a late night timeslot because it was not likely to obtain more than one or two percent viewership like prime time shows. Outlaw Star was voted as the 20th best anime of 1999 in the Japanese Animage Anime Grand Prix. During a summer 2001 online poll to determine which show would return to Toonami, Outlaw Star received approximately two-thirds of the more than 150,000 votes cast. In August 2002, Cartoon Network announced that the late-night Adult Swim Outlaw Star received a Nielsen rating of 0.9, up 125 percent for that same time slot and a delivery of 414,000, up 135 percent for the 18‚Äì34 age range. The Outlaw Star Complete Collection was the 21st best-selling anime DVD in the United States in 2006 and the 25th in 2007. In 2012, Bandai's North American division, Bandai Entertainment, listed Outlaw Star as one of its top five most successful anime properties. Josh Pool of IGN listed Outlaw Star at number six on its \\"Top Ten Anime Themes and Soundtracks of All-Time\\", noting a stark polarity between the opening and ending themes. Legacy In 1999, Sunrise produced a spin-off television series titled . Outlaw Star and Angel Links take place in the same universe; characters from both series appeared in an episode of Outlaw Star, but the two have little else in relation. Morning Star Studio also drafted a proposed sequel to Outlaw Star in the form of a single- episode OVA special titled Outlaw Star 2: Sword of Wind on its official website with character designs and a plot outline. Set three years after the events of Outlaw Star, it was to continue the adventures of Gene Starwind in his new starship named \\"Sword of Wind\\". Due to the lack of the franchise's popularity in Japan and the busy schedule of animation director Mitsuru Hongo, no production date was set. In October 2001, Takehiko It≈ç commented that his team only had static, preliminary plans for the sequel series and that they could perhaps continue the manga series in the future.

The figure represented 20% of total greenhouse gas output by Canadians at the time and aimed to help the country reach its Kyoto Protocol emission reduction targets. The Liberal Government under Jean Chr√©tien and Paul Martin approved over $45 million to fund the program from 2003 to 2006.Evaluation of the One-Tonne Challenge Program To promote this program, the government placed television and print ads featuring comedian Rick Mercer. In one commercial, he described Canadians as wanting to take the challenge. \\"C‚Äômon... we‚Äôre Canadian... we‚Äôre up for a challenge!\\" A magnet with a temperature indictator given to high school students as promotional giveaways. The government urged Canadians to do such things as: * Take public transit more often. * Idle vehicles less. * Use programmable thermostats. * Seal windows with caulking and weather-stripping. * Compost organic kitchen waste. * Support green energy. * Water and energy conservation. * Purchase electronics that are labelled with Energy Star logo. * Recycling.

It was created on 19 December 1826, for William Amherst, 2nd Baron Amherst, the Governor-General of India. He was made Viscount Holmesdale, in the County of Kent, at the same time, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Lord Amherst had succeeded his uncle Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst, as second Baron Amherst in 1797. The latter was a distinguished military commander best known as one of the victors of the French and Indian War. In 1776, he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron Amherst, of Holmesdale in the County of Kent, with normal remainder to heirs male of his body. In 1788, he was created Baron Amherst, of Montreal in the County of Kent, also in the Peerage of Great Britain, with special remainder to his nephew William Pitt Amherst and the heirs male of his body. The 1776 barony became extinct on his death in 1797, while he was succeeded in the 1778 barony as second Baron according to the special remainder by his nephew, William Amherst, who later was elevated to an earldom in 1826. The first Earl was succeeded in 1857, by his second but eldest surviving son, the second Earl, who prior to his ennoblement had represented East Grinstead in the House of Commons. On his death in 1886 the titles passed to his eldest son, the third Earl. He was a soldier and politician, who in 1880 had been summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's junior title of Baron Amherst. He died childless in 1910 and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Earl. The latter was one of the 112 peers who voted against the passing of the Parliament Act 1911. In 1927, he was succeeded by his son, the fifth Earl, on whose death in 1993, the titles became extinct. John Amherst (), brother of the first baron, was an admiral in the Royal Navy.

Treworgie had worked as an agent at a Kittery, Maine trading post from 1635 to 1650. In 1651 he was named as one of a party of six sent to Newfoundland to arrest Sir David Kirke who had been accused of withholding taxes collected on behalf of the crown and otherwise violating the royal charter which granted him the governorship of Newfoundland. His party was also ordered to administer the fishery and collect taxes on fish and oil from foreign fishermen. He remained after the arrest of Kirke and was named governor by the English government and given authority over both migratory fisherman and colonists and ordered to fortify the colony. John Treworgie was the son of James Treworgie (or Treworgy), the son-in-law of Alexander Shapleigh, a Devonshire merchant and fisheries owner who founded Kittery, Maine. John Treworgie was the brother-in-law of Hon. John Gilman of Exeter, New Hampshire.The Wentworth Genealogy, Vol. I, John Wentworth, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, Mass., 1878 In 1654 Treworgie and two other commissioners were arrested for illegally taking possession of David Kirke's property and was found guilty.

For the restricted definition, see Gleicheniaceae. Gleicheniales is an order of ferns in the subclass Polypodiidae (the leptosporangiate ferns). The Gleicheniales appeared in the fossil record at least as early as the Cretaceous.C.Michael Hogan. 2010. Fern. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and Environment, topic ed. S Basu. ed in chief C. Cleveland Description These ferns are characterized by root steles having 3‚Äì5 protoxylem poles and antheridia with 6‚Äì12 narrow, twisted or curved cells in their walls. Otherwise, their habitus is highly diverse, including plants with the typical fern fronds, others whose leaves resemble those of palm trees, and yet others again which have undivided leaves. They are tropical ferns, most diverse in Asia and the Pacific region. Classification In the molecular phylogenetic classification of Smith et al. in 2006, the Gleicheniales were placed in class Polypodiopsida (the leptosporangiate ferns). Three families, Dipteridaceae, Gleicheniaceae, and Matoniaceae were recognized. The linear sequence of Christenhusz et al. (2011), intended for compatibility with the classification of Chase and Reveal (2009) which placed all land plants in Equisetopsida, reclassified Smith's Polypodiopsida as subclass Polypodiidae and placed the Gleicheniales there. The circumscription of the order and its families was not changed, and that circumscription and placement in Polypodiidae has subsequently been followed in the classifications of Christenhusz and Chase (2014) and PPG I (2016). The form taxon Microphyllopteris is used for some Mesozoic Gleicheniales that cannot be reliably assigned to the present-day orders. The Triassic Antarctipteris and Gleichenipteris are sometimes ascribed to the Gleicheniaceae, but are probably better considered Gleicheniales incertae sedis. In historical treatments, the order has sometimes been treated as a subclass Gleicheniatae of the Pteridopsida, with the taxa treated as families here upranked to orders, so that a distinct subclass can be established for the leptosporangiate ferns. In other treatments, they were expanded to include the filmy ferns (order Hymenophyllales), as well as the similar-looking genus Hymenophyllopsis (as order Hymenophyllopsidales). The resultant group was treated as class Gleichenopsida alongside the Pteridopsida, which would then be limited to the leptosporangiate ferns. However, this class is not monophyletic but rather a basal grade, retaining ancient traits among the living ferns. Irrespective of their modern taxonomic treatment, the Gleicheniales were formerly included in the order Polypodiales. But the ferns in the loose sense are much too diverse a group to be shoehorned into one taxon at such a low rank. Footnotes References * (2006): A classification for extant ferns.

It stars Drew Barrymore, Sara Gilbert, Tom Skerritt, and Cheryl Ladd. The original music score is composed by David Michael Frank. The film was shot in Los Angeles. It was nominated for the 1992 Grand Jury prize of Best Film at the Sundance Festival. Sara Gilbert was nominated for Best Supporting Female at the 1993 Independent Spirit Awards. Although it did not fare very well at the box office, grossing $1,829,804 with its limited theatrical release to 20 movie theaters, the film received favorable word-of-mouth, and became a success on cable and video in the mid-1990s. It is the first installment in a film series that includes three direct-to-video sequels. Plot Sylvie Cooper is a young girl at a private school for the wealthy. At a local hangout, she first meets Ivy, a street-smart but poor, and trashy girl, and witnesses Ivy mercy-killing a heavily wounded dog. In their second meeting, when Sylvie's father Darryl comes to pick her up, Ivy asks for a ride, and Darryl reluctantly agrees. Ivy makes an excuse to sit in the front with Darryl. She puts her feet on the dashboard and deliberately allows her mini- skirt to fall back onto her hip, revealing her legs, which Darryl notices. A few weeks later, Sylvie invites Ivy to her house. She tells Ivy that Darryl is her adoptive father and that her biological father is African-American. She also says that she once tried to kill herself. They meet Sylvie's sickly mother, Georgie, whom Ivy later wins over by talking about her scholarship and helping her unblock her oxygen tank. Soon after, as both of Sylvie's parents enjoy Ivy's company, they practically allow Ivy to move in. Ivy and Sylvie share clothes and sleep in the same bed. As they have similar figures, Georgie lends Ivy some of her clothes. In an attempt to improve his failing career, Darryl decides to throw a party at his house, and enlists Sylvie to help him. However, Sylvie is needed at work on the night of the party, which is orchestrated by Ivy so that she will be the one to assist Darryl. After the party, she dances with Darryl in the kitchen and they hug. Georgie walks in on them and storms upstairs. Ivy apologizes to Georgie and claims that Darryl was under stress and she was only comforting him. Georgie believes Ivy, accepts a glass of champagne drugged with sleeping pills, and falls asleep. Ivy sits on the bed next to Georgie and begins to massage Darryl with her foot while he kisses her legs. Over the next few days, Ivy continues changing her appearance and wears Georgie's clothing more often. Sylvie becomes increasingly irritated with Ivy for her growing presence in her family, and her anger reaches a breaking point when even her dog chooses Ivy over her, which in fact is because Ivy has some dog treats in her pockets. Sylvie skips school and tries to spend some time alone. Darryl picks Ivy up and they go into the forest, where she gets him drunk and has sex with him. The next morning, Georgie plays a cassette tape that Sylvie made for her and walks out onto her balcony. Ivy walks up behind Georgie, talks to her and without warning, pushes her off the balcony to her death. Because Georgie is known to have a mental illness, and has threatened to commit suicide previously, Ivy is not suspected. A few weeks later, Sylvie talks Ivy into going for a ride in her mother's sports car. When Sylvie becomes suspicious of her involvement in Georgie's death, Ivy crashes the car, then moves the unconscious Sylvie into the driver's seat. In the hospital, Sylvie hallucinates that her mother is sitting in front of her. This inspires her to get back to her house in an attempt to save her father from Ivy. When she gets to her house, there is a raging storm. She runs inside to get out of the rain, experiencing hallucinations all along the way. When she gets inside, she sees Darryl and Ivy having sex, and flees the room. As Darryl runs outside to look for Sylvie, Ivy runs out after him, accidentally revealing that she was behind the wheel; due to scarring on her chest. She lies, claiming that it was to protect him. He drives off to find Sylvie and Ivy goes up to Georgie's old room, plays the tape Sylvie made for Georgie, wears Georgie's robe and walks out the balcony. Sylvie sees Ivy and because of her head injury, believes that it is her mother and makes her way to the balcony. Sylvie tells Georgie that she loves her and Georgie says she loves Sylvie too. When they kiss, Ivy begins to use her tongue, which breaks Sylvie out of her hallucination. Ivy says Georgie wanted to die and now the three of them can be a family. Sylvie pushes Ivy over the balcony, but Ivy holds onto Sylvie's necklace. The chain breaks and Ivy falls to her death. Darryl returns to see Ivy on the ground with Sylvie above. The film ends with Sylvie narrating that she still loves and misses \\"her\\", following the parallel between Ivy and Georgie. Cast Production Producers Melissa Goddard and Peter Morgan brought the original idea to New Line. The studio then hired Katt Shea who had made a number of movies for Roger Corman; according to head of production Sara Risher, the studio wanted \\"a teenage Fatal Attraction\\". The film developed greatly from this premise. There were three different drafts of the script and four different endings. According to Shea, the original ending had Ivy getting away with her crimes and hitch-hiking along a road. However, New Line insisted that Ivy be punished and made her shoot a new ending where Ivy died. New Line then wanted Shea to revive the character for sequels which the director did not want to do; Shea now says she regrets the decision.Katt Shea on Poison Ivy at Trailers from Hell Shea says that she never regarded Ivy as villainous, but rather as a tragic character who just wants to be loved. She credits this for the film's popularity. Reception =Critical response= The film debuted at the Sundance Film Festival where, according to The New York Times, viewers were \\"either enraptured or insulted\\". At the Seattle International Festival of Women Directors it was perceived to be politically incorrect. Shea stated: > I always told New Line it was going to be different from what they thought. > I'm out to prove it's possible to make a film that's really artistic, that's > an honest expression that comes from me and that can still be commercial. I > told them I can only make movies for myself. I just know that if I really > love it there's going to be a market for it. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 34% rating based on 29 reviews. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"An unpleasant thriller that lacks the self-awareness to dilute its sordid undertones, Poison Ivy is liable to give audiences a rash.\\" On Metacritic it has a score of 51% based on reviews from 24 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Variety wrote: \\"Suicide, hints of lesbianism, murder, staged accidents and every other applicable melodramatic contrivance is dragged in. Unfortunate thesps take it all very seriously, while technical aspects are emptily polished.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it 2.5 out of 4 and wrote \\"Here the casting is so wrong that nothing quite works.\\" The character Ivy was ranked at number six on the list of the top 26 \\"bad girls\\" of all time by Entertainment Weekly.

The present east portal is nearly east of the original's and is at above sea level, below the pass. The tunnel connects Berne in Chelan County on its east with Scenic Hot Springs in King County on its west and is the longest railroad tunnel in the United States.  History  =Original tunnel= The first tunnel began construction on August 20, 1897, and was completed on December 20, 1900. The tunnel was 2.6 miles long. John Frank Stevens was the principal engineer on the interim switchback route (opened in 1893, with grades up to 4 percent) and the first Cascade Tunnel. Stevens Pass, located above the tunnels, was named after him. The tunnel had a fume problem from the coal-burning steam locomotives. It was built with a 1.7% (1:58.8) gradient eastbound, which was too close to the ruling gradient of 2.2%. Because of the steepness of the line, the locomotives had to pull hard to make the grade and thus burn more coal, which would lead to immense smoke in the bore. The tunnel was electrified, with the project completed on July 10, 1909, eliminating the problem. The unusual system used was three-phase AC, 6600 volts at 25 Hz, from a 5 MW hydroelectric plant on the Wenatchee River just west of Leavenworth. The tunnel section only was electrified; 4.0 route miles (6.4 km) or 6.0 track miles (9.6 km) and 1.7 percent grade through the tunnel. The motive power for the section consisted of four GN boxcab locomotives supplied by the American Locomotive Company; they used electrical equipment from General Electric and were of 1500 hp and weighed each. Initially three locomotives were coupled together and hauled trains at a constant speed of , but when larger trains required four locomotives the motors were concatenated (cascade control), so that the speed was halved to to avoid overloading the power supply. The consulting engineer, Cary T. Hutchinson, published a detailed description of the system in 1909. The tunnel was still plagued by snow slides in the area. On March 1, 1910, an avalanche at Wellington (renamed \\"Tye\\" after the disaster), near the west portal of the original Cascade Tunnel, killed 96-101Middleton (1974). people, the deadliest avalanche disaster in U.S. history. This disaster prompted the construction of the current tunnel. The old tunnel was abandoned in 1929, after the new longer and lower [7.8 miles] tunnel was opened. During the winter of 2007‚Äì2008, a section of the roof caved in and created a debris dam inside the tunnel, making it impassable to pedestrians due to standing water and ceiling debris. A warning was issued to stay clear of the western side of the old tunnel for a distance of one-half mile for the indeterminate future.

Railroad officials at the Mill Creek shaft, allowing excavation to proceed outwards from within the mountains. Opening of the new tunnel, January 12, 1929. The new Cascade Tunnel was opened on January 12, 1929. The new line had 72.9 route-miles or 93.2 track miles electrified, between Skykomish and Wenatchee. The ruling grade was still 2.2 percent, although 21 miles of 2 percent or worse grade was eliminated. The line length was reduced by 8.7 miles, and maximum elevation was lowered by from to . The new tunnel was started in December 1925, and was built in just over three years by A. Guthrie of St. Paul, Minnesota; the aim was to finish by the winter of 1928‚Äì1929 so that further maintenance on deteriorating snow sheds could be avoided. Project manager and engineer Frederick Mears was assigned to make sure the project was completed. While the new tunnel was being constructed, the Great Northern received delivery of five new electric locomotives. The new locomotives had a motor-generator supplying DC traction motors, and the single-phase AC supply required only one instead of two overhead conductors. Hence, the Great Northern re-electrified 21 miles of the original route at single-phase (11 kV, 25 Hz) AC, including 8 miles that were subsequently abandoned upon completion of the new tunnel, and used steam locomotives on the short remaining stretches of the old line. On March 5, 1927, the three-phase electrification was abandoned, and the new locomotives were placed in service between Skykomish and the east portal of the old tunnel; the time was reduced from 4 hours for a 2500-ton eastbound train to 1 hour 45 minutes for a 3500-ton train. Furthermore, for the first time regenerated power could be used by another train or fed back to the utility company (power from regenerative braking was previously dissipated in a water rheostat at the power station).Middleton (1974), p.163-9. Two years later, the new tunnel opened. It was the longest railroad tunnel in the Americas until 1989, when the Mount Macdonald Tunnel in British Columbia was completed, moving the Cascade into second place. Electrification was removed in 1956, after a ventilation system was installed to eliminate diesel fumes. On April 4, 1996 an eastbound freight train broke through the doors at the east portal after they did not open properly. There were no injuries, but the broken doors slowed operations for a couple of days while replacement doors were brought up from the Seattle area. The Great Northern Z-1, one of the locomotives used on the new Cascade Tunnel The Great Northern Y-1, the other locomotive used on the current tunnel  Operations  East Portal doors opening West Portal in 2011 The current Cascade Tunnel is in full operation and receives regular maintenance from BNSF Railway. The new alignment is a straight-line tunnel running between Berne and Scenic Hot Springs. It is currently part of the BNSF Scenic Subdivision between Seattle and Wenatchee, and Amtrak's Empire Builder runs through it. Because of safety and ventilation issues, this tunnel is a limiting factor on how many trains the railroad can operate over this route from Seattle to Spokane. The current limit is 28 trains per day. Speed through the tunnel is 30 mph (48 km/h) for passenger trains, 25 mph (40 km/h) for freight trains. The gradient in this tunnel is 1.565% (1:64), with the rise from west to east. The gradient is 2.2% on the west side from the town of Skykomish. Most recently, telecommunications assets and track sections inside the tunnel were improved. =Ventilation operations= Because of the length of the tunnel, an unusual system is used to ensure that the air inside remains breathable and reduce problems with excess fumes. For example, as a train enters the west portal of the tunnel, a red-and-white-checkered door closes on the east portal and huge fans blow in cool air through a second portal to help the diesel engines. As long as the train is within the tunnel, the fans work with reduced power to avoid pressure problems. When the train is approximately halfway through the tunnel, the door opens in earnest. Once the train has cleared the tunnel, the door closes again and the fans operate for 20 to 30 minutes with maximum power to clear the tunnel of exhaust before the next train passes through. In the opposite direction, the door opens when the train is within . The fans are powered by two 800-horsepower electric motors, clearing the air through the of tunnel within 20 minutes. Present-day train crews carry portable respirators for use in the event of a fan failure or a train stalling inside the tunnel. In addition, there are emergency/safety stations spaced apart, depending on the location within the tunnel, that provide additional air tanks and equipment to be used in the event of a ventilation/other failure. The tunnel door is protected by an absolute signal near the east portal; on the west side, another signal with dual-flashing lunar aspects indicates to eastbound trains that the tunnel fans are operating.

Innocence by Pierre Paul Prud'hon, circa 1810 Innocence is a lack of guilt, with respect to any kind of crime, or wrongdoing. In a legal context, innocence is to the lack of legal guilt of an individual, with respect to a crime. In other contexts, it is a lack of experience. In relation to knowledge Innocence can imply lesser experience in either a relative view to social peers, or by an absolute comparison to a more common normative scale. In contrast to ignorance, it is generally viewed as a positive term, connoting an optimistic view of the world, in particular one where the lack of knowledge stems from a lack of wrongdoing, whereas greater knowledge comes from doing wrong. This connotation may be connected with a popular false etymology explaining \\"innocent\\" as meaning \\"not knowing\\" (Latin noscere (To know, learn)). The actual etymology is from general negation prefix in- and the Latin nocere, \\"to harm\\". People who lack the mental capacity to understand the nature of their acts may be regarded as innocent regardless of their behavior. From this meaning comes the usage of innocent as a noun to refer to a child under the age of reason, or a person, of any age, who is severely mentally disabled. Nonetheless, the word \\"innocence\\" is used to describe childhood innocence as a notion created and controlled by adults. As Jean-Jacques Rousseau describes 'childhood as a time of innocence' where children are 'not-knowing' and must reach the age of reason to become competent people in society. However, this is not the case anymore as technology advances, this has given children in the contemporary world a platform where they are referred to as 'digital natives', where they are seen more knowledgeable than adults Boyd, Danah, 1977-. It's Complicated: the Social Lives of Networked Teens. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2014. Print. Furthermore, because of digital media and the internet, young people have become well-informed of the world around them and have a better understanding. Pejorative meaning In some cases, the term \\"innocence\\" has a pejorative meaning, where an assumed level of experience dictates common discourse or baseline qualifications for entry into another, different, social experience. Since experience is a prime factor in determining a person's point of view, innocence is often also used to imply naivety or lack of personal experience. Symbolism Faience plate, Bordeaux, c. 1840, \\"A shadow which will later become realized\\". The lamb is a commonly used symbol of innocence's nature. In Christianity, for example, Jesus is referred to as the \\"Lamb of God\\", thus emphasizing his sinless nature. Other symbols of innocence include children, virgins, acacia branches (especially in Freemasonry), non-sexual nudity, songbirds and the color white (biblical paintings and Hollywood films depict Jesus wearing a white tunic). Loss of innocence A \\"loss of innocence\\" is a common theme in fiction, pop culture, and realism. It is often seen as an integral part of coming of age. It is usually thought of as an experience or period in a person's life that leads to a greater awareness of evil, pain and/or suffering in the world around them. Examples of this theme include songs like \\"American Pie\\", poetry like William Blake's collection Songs of Innocence and of Experience, novels like To Kill a Mockingbird, The Catcher in the Rye, A Farewell to Arms, and Lord of the Flies, and films like Viridiana, The 400 Blows, and Stand By Me. By contrast, the I Ching urges a recovery of innocence - the name given to Hexagram 25 - and \\"encourages you to actively practice innocence\\".B. B. Walker trans, The I Ching or Book of Changes (1993) p. 53 Innocence could also be viewed as a Westernized view of childhood, and the \\"loss\\" of innocence is simply a social construction or viewed as the dominant ideology. Thinkers such as Jean-Jaques Rousseau used the romanticism discourse as a way to separate children from adults. Ideas surrounding childhood and childhood innocence stems from this discourse. In psychoanalysis The psychoanalytic tradition is broadly divided between those (like Fairbairn and Winnicott) who saw the child as initially innocent, but liable to lose its innocence under the impact of stress or psychological trauma; and those (like Freud and Klein) who see the child as developing innocence - maturing into it - as a result of surmounting the Oedipus complex and/or the depressive position.N. Symington, Narcissism (1993) p. xiv-xv More eclectically, Eric Berne saw the Child ego state, and its vocabulary, as reflecting three different possibilities: the cliches of conformity; the obscenities of revolt; and \\"the sweet phrases of charming innocence\\".E. Berne, What Do You Say After You Say Hello? (1974) p. 325 In a rather different formulation, Christopher Bollas used the term 'Violent Innocence' to describe a fixed and obdurate refusal to acknowledge the existence of an alternative viewpointS.

The agency is governed by the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and Minister of Health. The agency was created in April 1997 by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act for the purpose of consolidating the delivery of all federal food safety, animal health, and plant health regulatory programs in Canada. As such, the CFIA was established by combining and integrating the related inspection services of three separate federal government departments:Chapter 12‚ÄîCreation of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

A CFIA technocrat is appointed to be Canada's delegate on the FAO committee that drafts the Codex Alimentarius, which is a vital component of the WTO framework. The CFIA is also responsible for monitoring pesticide residues in food. Health Canada establishes Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) for pesticide residues in all foods. MRLs are supposedly set for each pesticide-crop combination.PMRA: \\"Frequently Asked Questions on the Re-evaluation of Glyphosate\\", 28 Apr 2017canada.ca: \\"Maximum Residue Limits for Pesticides\\", 2015-02-17 = Agency officials = The Minister of Health is responsible for: * establishing policies and standards for the safety and nutritional quality of food sold in Canada; * the administration of those provisions of the Canadian Food and Drugs Act that relate to public health, safety and nutrition; and * for assessing the effectiveness of the Agency's activities related to food safety. The Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) of Canada resides in the CFIA hierarchy: Doctor Jaspinder Komal is also Vice President, Science at the CFIA. As delegate to the OIE, the CVO commits the nation to observe the standards created by the international body, which standards in turn serve the WTO. The Chief Food Safety Officer for Canada resides in the CFIA hierarchy: most recently, Lyzette Lamondin was appointed to the role in 2017. The Chief Plant Health Officer for Canada also resides in the CFIA hierarchy. The occupant of this position sits on the North American Plant Protection Organization and the International Plant Protection Convention, the latter of which informs the WTO's Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. William Anderson PhD is appointed to this post. The Chief Science Operating Officer, currently Primal Silva, is responsible for the CFIA's 13 laboratories (one of which is Canada's contribution to the BSL4ZNet: National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease) and sits on the Scientific Advisory Board of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development as well as the Global Coalition of Regulatory Science Research. = Food and Drugs Act = One of the main acts and regulations that CFIA uses is the Food and Drugs Act. There have been ongoing regulatory amendments brought forward with the most recent attempt at modernizing the Food and Drugs Act was the introduction of Bill C-51. Other Acts and Regulations also specify inspection requirements and for certain trade requirements, the need to register with CFIA to conduct business. Such companies are termed \\"registered establishments\\" as opposed to those \\"non-federally registered establishments\\" that fall solely under the Food and Drugs Act. While the Food and Drugs Act provide for core food safety standards, many companies opt to use third-party standards such as HACCP or ISO 22000 (which in any case incorporates HACCP) in order to meet client specified standards. Due to the race to globalize and the push to standardize it is no wonder that the Global Food Safety Initiative has been endorsed by the CFIA. All of these standards are closely observed by the food industry due to the potential loss of business. Here, the reader is encouraged to review the CFIA white paper Private Certification Policy (Food Safety), which at some point between 2014 and 2020 replaced the Guide to Food Safety. The Food and Drugs Act does not have any requirements for domestic manufacturers to notify the agency of their existence but companies generally require provincial registrations or municipal licenses to operate. Provincial authorities and local public health units carry out inspections and work with the CFIA to manage food safety risks. There is no requirement in the Food and Drugs Act for importers to directly notify the CFIA of their existence. Import notification is required for other commodities such as fish and meat. All commercial importers must have an import/export account with Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) who refers food, animal and plant imports to the CFIA as required. Through various phytosanitary requirements, CBSA import controls often cause the CFIA to take notice. =Power to recall= The Food and Drugs Act does not provide the power to recall food products and all recalls are done on a voluntary basis. However, Section 19 of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act provides authority for the Minister of Agriculture to order a recall, where there is reasonable grounds that the product poses a risk to public, animal or plant health.Canadian Food Inspection Act CFIA rates their recalls in three classifications (see below). Public notification of Class I and sometimes class II recalls is done by the CFIA. Lower risk recalls are listed in a published database on the CFIA web site. Recall classifications are conducted by the Office of Food Safety and Recall based on risk advice from Health Canada. *Class I is a situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death. *Class II is a situation in which the use of, or exposure to, a violative product may cause temporary adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote. *Class III is a situation in which the use of, or exposure to, a violative product is not likely to cause any adverse health consequences. =Food Inspector corps= The CFIA Food Inspector Corps. is unionized by the Agriculture Union, which in turn is an affiliate of PSAC. On 11 May 2020, the embedded inspectors at slaughterhouses (as represented by the AU) said that CFIA management is \\"threatening disciplinary action against employees who refuse to be reassigned to work at COVID-19-infected meat plants\\", while the intrepid journalist was keen to note that Deputy PM Chrystia Freeland had previously said that \\"those who feel unsafe won't be forced back to work.\\" Incidents =Outsourcing controversy= In July 2008, CFIA biologist Luc Pomerleau was fired for disloyalty to the government, because he transmitted to his union a sensitive Treasury Board minutes document, in which President Vic Toews and ministers approved the cuts proposed by Minister of Health Tony Clement that were to affect the inspection of animal feed mills, the certification of commercial seed, eliminate mandatory label registration of meat and processed products, the Avian Influenza Preparedness Program, and also called for the consolidation of three \\"import service centres\\" into one central facility. Pomerleau is no longer able to work for the government because he was deemed \\"unreliable\\" and fired for \\"gross misconduct\\".canada.com: \\"Scientist fired for sharing secret memo\\", 9 July 2008. Also see archive.org backup =August 2008 listeria outbreak= According to the findings of the Independent Investigator that was appointed by the government following the 2008 Listeriosis outbreak, there were 75 confirmed cases of listeriosis and was also the underlying or contributing cause of death for 22 of these individuals. Although most cases were in Ontario, illnesses occurred in seven provinces. The report identified response actions that worked well at the federal and provincial levels and gaps in the system should be corrected. Canadian researcher Sylvain Charlebois published a separate report suggesting that the listeria outbreak forces the agency to accept that food recalls are no longer mainly externally oriented; they are systemic in nature. =2017 glyphosate residue tests= In April 2017, it was reported that nearly a third of food samples in CFIA testing contain glyphosate residues. Glyphosate residues were detected in 29.7% of all food samples, with 1.3% containing residue levels above MRLs. For the grain products tested, 3.9% had residue levels about MRLs.

Gilbert fought on the English side during the first war of Scottish independence until his death in 1308. His heir, second son Robert, also fought on the side of the English and surrendered to King Robert de Brus during the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. He was released by Robert and treated with the Scots for peace with England. He was ultimately disinherited of his titles. Robert's heir Gilbert continued attempting to recover the Earldom and supported Edward Balliol and other disinherited barons and lords in Scotland. =Stewart Earls= John Stewart of Bonkyll, Berwickshire, obtained the title Earl of Angus in 1329 in a new line after the forfeiture of the de Umfraville line, though the latter family continued to use the title in England until 1381. This Stewart line ended with Margaret Stewart, countess of Angus in her own right, and widow of Thomas, Earl of Mar. =Douglas earls= An illicit affair between Margaret Stewart, Countess of Mar and Angus, and her brother in law, William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas (married to the sister of her husband) produced George Douglas, 1st Earl of Angus (c. 1380‚Äì1403). The Countess secured a charter of her estates for her son, to whom in 1389 the title was granted by King Robert II. He was taken prisoner at Homildon Hill in 1402, and died in captivity in England. Archibald \\"Bell-the-Cat\\" (1453‚Äì1514) the powerful adversary of James III, was his great-grandson. William Douglas (1589‚Äì1660) 11th Earl of Angus, was created Marquis of Douglas in 1633. He resigned the title of Earl of Angus, having it recreated with the marquessate, so he was the 1st Earl of Angus in the new creation. He outlived his son Archibald Douglas, Earl of Angus (c.1609‚Äì1655) and was succeeded by Archibald's son James Douglas, 2nd Marquess of Douglas (1646‚Äì1699). James' son and heir Archibald Douglas was created Duke of Douglas, Marquess of Angus and Abernethy, Viscount of Jedburgh Forest, and Lord Douglas of Bonkill, Prestoun and Robertoun on 10 April 1703. He died without leaving an heir and the titles acquired with the dukedom became extinct.

Panphobia is not registered as a type of phobia in medical references. History The term panphobia was first coined by Th√©odule-Armand Ribot in his 1911 work The Psychology of the Emotions. He defined it as \\"a state in which a patient fears everything or nothing, where anxiety, instead of being riveted on one object, floats as in a dream, and only becomes fixed for an instant at a time, passing from one object to another, as circumstances may determine.\\" The term comes from the Greek œÄ·æ∂ŒΩ - pan, neuter of \\"œÄ·æ∂œÇ\\" - pas, \\"all\\"œÄ·æ∂œÇ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus and œÜœåŒ≤ŒøœÇ - phobos, \\"fear\\".œÜœåŒ≤ŒøœÇ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus The Greek root word pan (ex. pan-ic) describes \\"the unpleasant state inflicted by the intervention of the god Pan.\\" Pan is characterized as a human‚Äìanimal hybrid who \\"appeared as the agent of panic fear (that collective, animal-like disorder that seizes military camps at rest, especially at night) and of a form of individual possession (panolepsy).\\" According to Herodotus, it was Pan who was able to lead the Athenians to victory in the Battle of Marathon, forcing the Persians to flee. It has been argued that pantophobia may actually be considered the more accurate name to describe the non- specificity associated with a fear of all. Diagnosis There is no specific phobia in the DSM-5 which provides criteria for an all-encompassing fear of everything, though the defining symptom for generalized anxiety disorder in this manual is \\"excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation) about a number of events or activities.\\" Another very relatable state of mind is paranoia, in which one fears that unknown threats could, and most likely will, come from anyone, with distrust potentially leading to a loss of touch with reality. Delusional disorder is a more severe form of this type of disorder. Relevant academic literature may point to panphobia as merely a piece of such more complex states of mental disorder. Pseudoneurotic schizophrenia may be diagnosable in patients who, in addition to panphobia, also exhibit symptoms of pananxiety, panambivalence, and to a lesser extent, chaotic sexuality. These persons differ from generalized anxiety sufferers in that they have \\"free-floating anxiety that rarely subsides\\" and are clinically diagnosable as having borderline personality disorder in the DSM-IV-TR. No significant changes related to this personality disorder were made in transitioning to the DSM-5, suggesting the diagnostic criteria are still appropriate.

It is the sixth enlisted rate in the United States Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps, ranking just above petty officer second class and directly below chief petty officer. It is designated as non-commissioned officer, as are all petty officer ratings.Non-commissioned officer#United States. It is equivalent to the rank of staff sergeant in the Army and Marine Corps, and technical sergeant in the Air Force. They are all ranked E-6, which refers to the enlisted numbering system associated with pay grades. Overview In the United States Navy, each rating is officially abbreviated, such as ET for Electronics Technician, STS for Sonar Technician Submarines, or FT for Fire Control Technician. It is common practice to refer to the Petty Officer by this shorthand in all but the most formal correspondence (such as printing and inscription on awards). Often, the Petty Officer is just referred to by the shorthand designation, without using the surname. Thus ET1 Jones would just be called \\"ET1\\". A First Class Petty Officer may be generically referred to as PO1 when the sailor's rating is not known, although some prefer to be called simply \\"Petty Officer (last name)\\". To address a Petty Officer, one would say, \\"Petty Officer Smith\\", \\"Smith\\", or \\"Sailor\\" (the latter two forms being acceptable for use by those equal or greater in rank than the Petty Officer). It is uncommon to address a Petty Officer as simply, \\"Petty Officer\\" the way one might address an NCO in the Marine Corps as \\"Sergeant\\". Also acceptable, but archaic, would be to address a Petty Officer or Chief Petty Officer of any grade as \\"Mister Smith\\" or \\"Ms. Smith\\". The use of \\"Ms.\\" or \\"Mister\\" is commonly only in reference to junior commissioned officers or warrant officers. Similar to Petty Officer Second Class and Third Class, advancement to Petty Officer First Class is contingent upon the following conditions: *Completed a period of time-in-rate (three years time-in-rate as a second-class petty officer, or two years if the second-class petty officer received a promotion recommendation of \\"early promote\\" (EP) on their latest periodic performance evaluation and the second- class petty officer's commanding officer authorizes a one-year time-in-rate waiver). *Recommended for advancement by the commanding officer. *Have an established performance mark average. *No pending request for voluntary transfer to the fleet reserve. The advancement cycle is currently every 6 months (March and September). Only second-class petty officers that achieve a passing score on the biannual advancement examination are eligible to be advanced to first-class petty officer. Once the examination is complete, a quota is established based upon the needs of the Navy with respect to the specific rating the sailor holds. Using the rating ET (electronics technician) as an example: *1,000 ET2 (electronics technician, second class) eligible to be advanced after passing the advancement examination *100 are allowed to be advanced to ET1 (electronics technician, first class) by the Navy (a 10% quota) *The 100th eligible ET2 received a 219.5 final multiple score, therefore 219.5 is the lowest possible final multiple allowed to advance to ET1. The Navy's current high year tenure policy imposes a maximum enlistment of 22 years (total active service) to a petty officer first class. If a petty officer first class is not selected to the paygrade of chief petty officer within those 22 years, the petty officer is honorably retired from active service in the United States Navy, and placed in Fleet Reserve (inactive service) for a period of 8 to 10 years. Should there be no recall of the sailor to active duty due to war or national emergency, the sailor will then transition to a \\"retired\\" status after a combined total of 30 years of service. The rate insignia for a petty officer, first class is a perched eagle above three chevrons. On more formal uniforms (dress white and dress blue uniform), the symbol for the petty officer's rating will be placed between the eagle and the chevrons. On white uniforms, the eagle, rating, and chevrons are dark blue (almost black- this has led to the eagle being referred to as the \\"crow\\" in common practice, and often the entire rating badge is simply referred to as the crow). On navy blue (black) uniforms, the eagle and rating are white, and the chevrons are red, unless the sailor has served in the Navy for 12 years or more with good conduct- then that sailor wears gold chevrons on the dress blue uniform. Gold chevrons are also worn on the collars of the Navy blue coveralls uniform, and on the black garrison cap (only) worn with the Navy service working uniform (often called \\"peanut butters\\" or \\"black and tans\\"). The Coast Guard does not use golden chevrons. Working uniforms (all variations of the camouflage uniform) and metal rank devices do not have the rating badge symbol. First class petty officers normally serve as leading petty officers of a division, and direct the activities of a division. There are situations when there are more than one first class petty officers in a division, due to the demands for highly experienced or skilled Sailors in technical areas. Leading petty officer experience for a first-class petty officer is not officially required for advancement to chief petty officer (E7); however, it is generally accepted that at least one documented tour as an LPO (preferably at sea) is a vital step for advancement. First-class petty officers often form associations at their commands. Memberships in these associations are voluntary. On larger ships and some shore commands, PO1s may have their own mess, although unlike the CPO mess and wardroom mess, which have their own galleys and cooks, the first class \\"mess\\" is merely a separate compartment for eating meals from the general crew mess. Petty officers (E4-E6) serve a dual role as both technical experts and as leaders. Unlike the sailors below them, there is no such thing as an \\"undesignated petty officer.\\" Every petty officer has both a rate (rank) and rating (job, similar to a Military Occupation Specialty (MOS) in other services). A petty officer's full title is a combination of the two. Thus, a petty officer, first class, who has the rating of electronics technician would properly be called an Electronics Technician First Class, or ET1. The term \\"petty officer\\" is typically only used in the general sense when referring to a group of petty officers of different ratings, when the petty officer's rating is unknown, or when someone who is E-3 or below addresses a petty officer while in basic training or \\"A\\" school.

It rises in the northwestern portion of the state near the Blue Ridge Parkway's Thunder Hill Overlook. Several parts of the river are impounded by dams for water, power, and flood control. The river becomes the Pee Dee River at the confluence of the Uwharrie River south of the community of Badin and east of the town of Albemarle. The river then flows into South Carolina near Cheraw, which is at the Fall Line. The entirety of the Yadkin River and the Great Pee Dee River is part of the Yadkin-Pee Dee River Basin. Etymology The meaning of the word Yadkin, derived from Yattken, or Yattkin, a Siouan Indian word, is unknown. In Siouan terminology it may mean \\"big tree\\" or \\"place of big trees.\\" Alternate names include: :Adkin River :Atkin River :Big Yadkin River :Reatkin River :Sapona River :Yatkin River Yadkin County, North Carolina, and its county seat, the town of Yadkinville, are named after the river. History Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the Yadkin basin was inhabited by Siouan- speaking tribes. The Saura and Tutelo tribes are mentioned in historic records of the area. Before the Revolutionary War, colonial settlers of primarily Scots-Irish, German, and English extraction migrated into the Yadkin basin from Virginia and Pennsylvania using the Great Wagon Road and the Carolina Road. Notably, these included Moravian colonists from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania who occupied the 100,000-acre Wachovia tract following its purchase in 1753 (See also Old Salem). On May 9, 1771, when marching to join Governor William Tryon's army at the Battle of Alamance, a colonial force was intercepted along the Yadkin in Rowan County by a larger force of Regulators formed under Captain Benjamin Merrill. Realizing their forces were outnumbered, Tryon's men fell back to Salisbury, and were unable to join the governor until after the battle at Alamance was fought.Captain Benjamin Merrell & The Regulators of Colonial North Carolina; [via \\"History of the Liberty Baptist Association, by Elder Henry Sheets, Edwards & Broughton of Raleigh, N.C, (1907)\\"]; TAMU; accessed Aug 2018 In 1859 the NC Supreme court noted \\"it is certain that the Yadkin river is capable of private ownership and that some parts of the riverbed have been granted to private individuals.\\" The court determined that the owners of the dam across the Yadkin could not have his property taken without just compensation. Use The river is extensively used for recreation. Fishing consists mostly of sunfish, catfish, largemouth bass and white bass in the spring and early summer. Canoeing and rafting are also possible. A portion of the river flows through Pilot Mountain State Park. Morrow Mountain State Park and the Uwharrie National Forest are along the banks of the river where the river's name changes to the Pee Dee River. =State trail= In 1985, the NC General Assembly established the Yadkin River State Trail as a paddle trail which follows the river for . The paddle trail is a part of the North Carolina State Trails System, which is a section of the NC Division of Parks and Recreation. A system of launch points and camping locations were created along the river for the trail. Geography Principal tributaries of the Yadkin include the Reddies, Roaring, Mitchell, Fisher, Ararat and South Yadkin Rivers. Water supply Water supplies for many communities in North and South Carolina are taken from the Yadkin-Pee Dee and during drought years the division of the water is a contentious issue. The Mitchell River was impacted in the 1980s by massive runoff of sediment from land clearing at the Olde Beau development. Numerous citations from the NC EPA were issued against developer Earl Slick but the development proceeded. Today the golf course community near Roaring Gap is a good tax base for impoverished Allegheny County. =Lakes created by dams along the Yadkin/Pee Dee River= There are many reservoirs created by damming the Yadkin and Pee Dee rivers within the bounds of North Carolina, and are listed from upstream to downstream: *W. Kerr Scott Reservoir *High Rock Lake *Tuckertown Reservoir *Badin Lake *Falls Reservoir *Lake Tillery *Blewitt Falls Lake All but W. Kerr Scott generate hydroelectric power, and High Rock, Tuckertown, Badin, and Falls were managed by Alcoa under contract with the US Government, under oversight by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The contract with FERC expired in April 2008, and was under review after the N.C. Division of Water Quality revoked their water-quality certificate that the company needs to continue operating its power-generating dams along the river. The governor of North Carolina, Bev Perdue, and other North Carolina politicians made it a priority to recapture the Yadkin River water rights, but this has been denied. On September 22, 2016, Alcoa received a license to operate until March 31, 2055, a period 12 years shorter than desired. The license requires a minimum water level and a swimming beach for High Rock Lake. The terms of the license will now apply to Cube Hydro Carolinas, which bought the hydroelectric power operations.

The following factors may be taken into consideration: * Precipitation rate of the irrigation equipment ‚Äì how quickly the water is applied, often expressed in inches or mm per hour. * Distribution uniformity of the irrigation system ‚Äì how uniformly the water is applied, expressed as a percentage, the higher the number, the more uniform. * Soil infiltration rate ‚Äì how quickly the water is absorbed by the soil, the rate of which also decreases as the soil becomes wetter, also often expressed in inches or mm per hour. * Slope (topography) of the land being irrigated as this affects how quickly runoff occurs, often expressed as a percentage, i.e. distance of fall divided by 100 units of horizontal distance (1 ft of fall per would be 1%). * Soil available water capacity, expressed in units of water per unit of soil, i.e. inches of water per foot of soil. * Effective rooting depth of the plants to be watered, which affects how much water can be stored in the soil and made available to the plants. * Current watering requirements of the plant (which may be estimated by calculating evapotranspiration, or ET), often expressed in inches per day. * Amount of time in which water or labor may be available for irrigation. * Amount of allowable moisture stress which may be placed on the plant. For high value vegetable crops, this may mean no allowable stress, while for a lawn some stress would be allowable, since the goal would not be to maximize production, but merely to keep the lawn green and healthy. * Timing to take advantage of projected rainfall * Timing to take advantage of favorable utility rates * Timing to avoid interfering with other activities such as sporting events, holidays, lawn maintenance, or crop harvesting. The goal in irrigation scheduling is to apply enough water to fully wet the plant's root zone while minimizing overwatering and then allow the soil to dry out in between waterings, to allow air to enter the soil and encourage root development, but not so much that the plant is stressed beyond what is allowable. In recent years, more sophisticated irrigation controllers have been developed that receive ET input from either a single on-site weather station or from a network of stations and automatically adjust the irrigation schedule accordingly. Other devices helpful in irrigation scheduling are rain sensors, which automatically shut off an irrigation system when it rains, and soil moisture sensing devices such as capacitance sensors, tensiometers and gypsum blocks.

It has represented a historically important port for many centuries. Massawa was the capital of the Italian Colony of Eritrea until the seat of the colonial government was moved to Asmara in 1897. Massawa has an average temperature of 30 ¬∞C/86 ¬∞F, which is one of the highest found in the world, and is \\"one of the hottest marine coastal areas in the world.\\" History Historical map of Massawa Massawa was originally a small seaside village, lying in lands coextensive with the Kingdom of Axum‚Äîalso known as Kingdom of Zula in antiquity‚Äîand overshadowed by the nearby port of Adulis about to the south. Massawa has been ruled or occupied by a succession of polities during its history, including the Aksumite Empire, Abyssinia , Italian Eritrea and the Ottoman Empire. Following the fall of Axum in the 8th century, the area around Massawa and the town itself fell under the occupation of the Umayyad Caliphate from 702 to 750 CE. The Beja people would also come to rule within Massawa during the Bajag Kingdom of Eritrea from the year 740 to the 14th century. Massawa was situated between the sultanates of Qata, Baqulin, and Dahlak. Midri-Bahri, an Eritrean kingdom (14th‚Äì19th centuries), gained leverage at various times and ruled over Massawa. The port city would also come under control of the Balaw people (people of Arab descent), during the Balaw Kingdom of Eritrea (12th‚Äì15th centuries). At this time, the Sheikh Hanafi Mosque, one of the country's oldest mosques, was built on Massawa Island. The city reportedly has the oldest mosque in Africa, that is the Mosque of the Companions. It was reportedly built by companions of Muhammad who escaped persecution by Meccans. = Portuguese = In the struggle for domination of the Red sea the Portuguese ended up conquering Massawa ( Ma√ßua) and Arkiko in 1513 by Diogo Lopes de Albergaria, a port that they used for the entering in to allied territory of Ethiopia in the fight against the ottomans. King Manuel I ,first gave orders for the construction of a fortress that was never built. However, during Portuguese presence, it was lifted as well as the existing cisterns and wells for the Portuguese Navy watery. It was drawned by D. Jo√£o de Castro in 1541 in his \\" Roteiro do Mar Roxo\\" in their route to attack El Tor and Suez .The captain of the Arkiko was the Portuguese Gon√ßalo Ferreira, second port on the coast that guaranteed the presence and maintenance of the Portuguese fleets, whenever the port of Massawa was threatened by the Turkish presence. Until the mid 17th century Massawa was the main port that the Portuguese used, to maintain contact whit their main Christian allied in the region. Drawing by D. Jo√£o Castro, Massawa port in 1541\\" Roteiro do Mar Roxo\\" = Ottoman = Massawa rose to prominence when it was captured by the Ottoman Empire in 1557. The Ottomans made it the capital of Habesh Eyalet. Under √ñzdemir Pasha, Ottoman troops then attempted to conquer the rest of Eritrea. Due to resistance as well as sudden and unexpected demands for more the Ottomans did not conquer the rest of Eritrea. The Ottoman authorities placed the city and its immediate hinterlands under the control of one of the aristocrats of the Bellou people, whom they appointed \\"Naib of Massawa\\" and made answerable to the Ottoman governor at Suakin.Richard Pankhurst, The Ethiopian borderlands (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1997), p. 270. The Ottomans nevertheless built parts of the old town of Massawa on Massawa Island into a prominent port on the Red Sea. These buildings and the old town of Massawa remain to this day, having withstood both earthquakes and wars with aerial bombardment. The rules were intermittent for long periods and it became an Italian possession in 1885.https://www.britannica.com/place/Massawa Massawa in the 19th century In 1846, Massawa, and later much of the Northeast African coast of the Red Sea, came under the rule of the Khedive of Egypt with Ottoman consent. Following Egypt's defeat at the Battle of Gura, Egyptian control of the port withered. With the help of the British, the city eventually came under Italian control and became part of Italy's colony of Eritrea in 1885. Italian colonists started to settle in the port area in the early 1890s. =Italian rule= Train between Asmara and Massawa Two Eritrean boys in front of an Italian vessel in the first half of the 20th century At the end of the 19th century, the Kingdom of Italy created a modern port in Massawa for their newly acquired colony of Eritrea. In 1885‚Äì1897, Massawa (in the Italian spelling: 'Massaua') served as the capital of the region, before Governor Ferdinando Martini moved his administration to Asmara. Ras Alula's attack on nearby Dogali helped precipitate the First Italo-Ethiopian War; the Italians' disastrous defeat at Adwa ended their hopes of expanding further into the Ethiopian highlands for a decade and brought Menelik II's newly formed Ethiopian Empire international recognition. The Italian colony suffered repeated earthquakes. Most of the city was completely destroyed by the 1921 earthquake; it took until 1928 to fully restore the port, hampering initially the Italian colonial ambitions. A view of the port of Massawa on the Ethiopian dollar note, during the reign of Haile Selassie The War Memory Square in Massawa Massawa became the largest and safest port on the east coast of Africa, and the largest deep-water port on the Red Sea. Between 1887 and 1932, they expanded the Eritrean Railway, connecting Massawa with Asmara and then Bishia near the Sudan border, and completed the Asmara-Massawa Cableway. At long, it was the longest ropeway conveyor in the world at the time. In 1938, Massawa had 15,000 inhabitants, of which almost 2,000 were Italians: the city was improved with an architectural plan similar to the one in Asmara, with a commercial and industrial area. Italian Massaua Plan (in Italian) p. 65 During World War II Massawa was the homeport for the Red Sea Flotilla of the Italian Royal Navy. When the city fell during the East African Campaign, a large number of Italian and German ships were sunk in an attempt to block use of Massawa's harbor. From 15 April 1942, later master diver and salvage specialist RNR Lieutenant Peter Keeble (then a complete rookie in both disciplines) was assigned to the clearing of the harbour.Keeble, Peter (1957). Ordeal by water. Longmans, Green & co. No ISBN number available. He succeeded only in the simple task of salvaging an ex-Italian tugboat. The same month, United States Navy Commander Edward Ellsberg and his handful of crew arrived to take over. The wrecks were salvaged in short order and the port was returned to service, as part of what had now become the British protectorate of Eritrea. In 1945, following the end of World War II, the port of Massawa suffered damage as the occupying British either dismantled or destroyed much of the facilities. These actions were protested by Sylvia Pankhurst in her book Eritrea on the Eve.Also detailed in the chapter \\"The Feminist Fuzzy-Wuzzy\\" of Michela Wong's I didn't do it for you: how the world betrayed a small African nation (New York: Harper- Perennial, 2005), pp. 116‚Äì150. =Ethiopian rule= From 1952 to 1990, when Eritrea entered into a federation with Ethiopia, previously landlocked Ethiopia briefly enjoyed the use of Massawa as the headquarters of the now defunct Ethiopian Navy. Ultimately, Ethiopia dismantled the federation and forcibly annexed and occupied Eritrea. This led to the Eritrean War of Independence (1961‚Äì1991). In February 1990, units of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front captured Massawa in a surprise attack from both land and sea. Known as Operation Fenkil, the attack utilized both infiltrated commandos and speed boats. The success of this attack cut the major supply line to the Second Ethiopian Army in Asmara, which then had to be supplied by air. In response, the then leader of Ethiopia Mengistu Haile Mariam ordered Massawa bombed from the air, resulting in considerable damage.The damage of this continuous aerial assault on civilians is detailed in the Africa Watch Report, Ethiopia: \\"Mengistu has Decided to Burn Us like Wood\\": Bombing of Civilians and Civilian Targets by the Air Force, 24 July 1990 , the Eritrean government is rebuilding and repairing this damage. =Eritrean independence= With Eritrea's de facto independence (complete military liberation) in 1991, Ethiopia reverted to being landlocked and its Navy was dismantled (partially taken over by the nascent national navy of Eritrea). During the Eritrean- Ethiopian War the port was inactive, primarily due to the closing of the Eritrean-Ethiopian border which cut off Massawa from its traditional hinterlands. A large grain vessel donated by the United States, containing 15,000 tonnes of relief food, which docked at the port late in 2001, was the first significant shipment handled by the port since the war began.\\"Horn of Africa, Monthly Review, covering the months between November and December, 2001\\", UN-OCHA (accessed 24 February 2009) Transportation Massawa is home to a naval base and large dhow docks. It also has a station on the railway line to Asmara. Ferries sail to the Dahlak Islands and the nearby Sheikh Saeed Island, aka Green Island. In addition, the city's air transportation needs are served by the Massawa International Airport. Main sights Notable buildings in the city include the shrine of Sahaba, as well as the 15th century Sheikh Hanafi Mosque and various houses of coral. Many Ottoman buildings survive, such as the local bazaar. Later buildings include the Imperial Palace, built in 1872 to 1874 for Werner Munzinger; St. Mary's Cathedral; and the 1920s Banco d'Italia. The Eritrean War of Independence is commemorated in a memorial of three tanks in the middle of Massawa. Climate Massawa has a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BWh). The city receives a very low average annual rainfall amount totalling around and consistently experiences soaringly high temperatures during both day and night. The annual mean average temperature approaches , which is one of the highest found in the world. Massawa is noted for its very high summer humidity despite being a desert city. This combination of the desert heat and high humidity makes the apparent temperatures seem even more extreme. The sky is usually clear and bright throughout the year.

Early life Born in Milton, Canada West, the son of Edward Martin, a former Reeve, and Mary Ann Fleming, Martin was educated at the Milton public school, the Toronto Normal School and University of Toronto. He was a telegraph operator and afterwards obtained a First-class Teacher's certificate, and was appointed Principal of the public school in New Edinburgh, Ontario. He studied law in Ottawa and moved to Portage la Prairie, Manitoba in 1882. He was called to the Bar of Manitoba in 1882. Political career =Manitoba= He was first elected as the member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for the Portage la Prairie riding in 1883 and served as Attorney-General in the government of Thomas Greenway. In 1890, he initiated legislation to end French language instruction and support for Catholic separate schools, prompting the Manitoba Schools Question crisis. =Canada= Martin ran unsuccessfully as a Liberal candidate in the 1891 election to become the Member of Parliament for Selkirk. When Sir Hugh Macdonald resigned his Winnipeg seat, Martin ran in the 1893 by-election and won by acclamation. He lost the seat to Macdonald when they both ran for re-election in Selkirk in the 1896 election. He later ran in the 1908 election as an Independent in the Vancouver City riding but was not elected. =British Columbia= After his defeat in Manitoba, MartinOrmsby, 320-325 left for British Columbia to settle in Vancouver. He arrived at a time of booming prosperity. He took up the practice of law and made a fortune developing the Hastings Manor subdivision in Vancouver. Martin was first elected to the British Columbia Legislative Assembly in 1898 election in the multi-member Vancouver City riding. The election did not yield a majority for any one party. With increased representation for mainland ridings and a shift in popular support from the Turner government, a government of special interests, railway industrialists, coal barons, lumber and fishing capitalists, Turner's support fell to 17 of 38 seats. Lieutenant-Governor Thomas R. McInnes dismissed Turner on August 8, 1898 without allowing him the constitutional right to meet the legislature. Instead he turned to former premier Robert Beaven, even though he had not been elected in his constituency, to form a government. He was unable to do so, and McInnes then turned to Charles Semlin to form a government. Semlin took office as premier and chose Martin as his Attorney-General. During the two year Semlin government, Martin produced controversy by introducing measures such as an eight-hour work day (opposed by mine owners) and an Alien Exclusion Act to prevent Chinese from owning mining claims. The federal government, at the instance of American interests, took steps to disallow the legislation. During a controversial public meeting about the issue, Martin breached cabinet solidarity and criticized his own government resulting in a request from Premier Semlin for Martin's resignation. Semlin reconstituted his ministries and met the legislature facing strong opposition from Martin, often requiring the Speaker of the house to break ties by using his casting vote. On February 27, 1900 McInnes dismissed Semlin and, the following day, asked Martin to form a government. The result was a vote of non-confidence by the house which carried by a majority of 28 to 1. Nevertheless, Martin formed a cabinet and governed for three months before going to the polls in the 1900 election. Although hard fought, Martin had only 13 supporters elected. The Semlin faction had even fewer at 6 and Semlin was defeated personally. Following the election, Prime Minister Laurier dismissed McInnes and appointed Sir Henri- Gustave Joly de Lotbini√®re lieutenant-governor. The legislature was able to agree to support James Dunsmuir to lead a government. Martin served in the opposition (He became the first leader of the Liberal party of British Columbia)http://www.biographi.ca/fr/bio/martin_joseph_15E.html until he was defeated in the 1903 election, the first in British Columbia organized on party lines. In 1907, he founded the Vancouver Guardian newspaper. After his return from England, he ran in the 1920 election in Vancouver as an Independent under the banner of the Asiatic Exclusion League. He was defeated and lost his deposit. Martin, who died of complications from diabetes in March 1923, was the first person in Vancouver to be treated with insulin.Morton, 240 =United Kingdom= He moved to the United Kingdom where he won a seat in the British House of Commons as a Liberal Member of Parliament for St Pancras East. He served from 1910 until 1918. In December 1911, Winston Churchill, then the First Lord of the Admiralty, had announced to the House of Commons that the British fleet was ready for war. Martin fiercely attacked the Admiralty over the grounding of the warship Niobe \\"only to be completely and unceremoniously silenced by a biting answer from the First Lord.\\"Morton, 220-222 The St Pancras East Liberal Association and Martin had a difficult relationship. By 1914 the association did not want Martin to continue as their MP and in May selected Richard Leopold Reiss to be their candidate for the general election expected to be called late 1914/early 1915.Shoreditch Observer 2 May 1914 Martin said he would resign his seat and contest the resulting by-election as an Independent Lib-Lab candidate. Confronted with the prospect of losing the by-election to the Unionist, due to a split Liberal vote, the Liberal association told Martin in June that they would not contest the by-election.\\"News in Brief.\\" Times [London, England] 1 June 1914: 6. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 29 May 2016. In July Martin announced that he would instead resign his seat and return to his native Canada, allowing Reiss to run against a Unionist in the by-election.Liverpool Echo 6 Jul 1914 Martin changed his mind again and decided not to resign his seat. In August war was declared, the general election was deferred, Reiss resigned as candidate to enlisted and Martin continued as MP. Relations between Martin and his local Liberal association continued to be uncertain. Finally he crossed the floor to join the Labour Party. In early 1918 he was selected to run as Labour candidate in neighbouring Islington South. However, by close of nominations, there was no Labour candidate nominated. Martin was also a candidate for mayor of Vancouver in 1914 and founded another newspaper there in 1916.

Etymology The etymology of 'Orders' is unclear, although there are records extant dating the surname in its current spelling back to the 17th century in the Warminster region of Wiltshire and the 16th century in Cambridgeshire, England. The root of the name in its possible variant spelling forms can be ALD, AUD, OLD or ORD to which have been added a suffix such as AS, ES, ERS, IS, OS, US, etc. 'Orders' therefore has many possible genealogical or historical derivations which are affiliated in common via the shared modern spelling. Derivation The modern surname is now found in many parts of the world, and suggestions as to its historical roots include: *that it is an alternative spelling of AUDAS, which itself comes from two distinct sources, one of early medieval English origin and one of Scottish origin. The English form of the name derives from the Middle English female personal name \\"Aldus\\", itself a pet form of any of the numerous Olde English pre 7th Century male and female personal names with \\"(e)ald\\", old, as its first element. For example \\"Radulfus filius (son of) Alduse\\" is said to be noted in the 1168 Pipe Rolls of Yorkshire. The Scottish form of the surname is locational from Auldhous, in Strathclyde (Renfrewshire). The placename derives from the Olde English \\"eald\\" old, with \\"hus\\", house, hence \\"old house\\". *it may be part of a locational name from a place called Ord in Northumberland, deriving from the Old English pre-7th Century \\"ord\\" or \\"orde\\" meaning \\"point\\". This may refer to a headland, a certain geographical 'point', a long ridge or someone dwelling at one these locales. *it may be an Anglicized form of the Germanic personal name Ort, a short form of the various compound names, such as ORDERS, with the first element meaning \\"point\\" (for example of a sword, spear, hill, or army). 'Hare', or 'army' in old-German, is thought to have been the second element in the compound 'ord-hare' leading to 'orders'. *in its many different spellings from Ort, Imort, and Delort, to Horta, Huerta and Hurtic, this is a surname of French, Spanish, Portuguese and German derivation. The origin is usually pre-5th century C.E. German or Visigoth, the latter tribe being the conquerors of the Spanish region in the period between the 6th and 8th centuries. As a result many, perhaps the majority of popular Spanish and Portuguese surnames have some Germanic influence. In this case the surname is topographical and generally describes a person who lived in an 'ort', this being a settlement on the top of a hill, or in the case of the French nameholders, in a walled area, probably a defensive fortress. In some case the surname may have been descriptive for a soldier who carried an 'ort', this being a spear or lance. *it may derive its origin from Orderic Vitalis or his father, Odelerius of Orleans, a priest who came to England with William the Conqueror. *the Oxford University Press Names Companion lists under the surname of ORT a Southern French (Proven√ßal or Occitan) root that stems from the Latin 'HORTUS', Latin for 'garden' or 'gardener'. This has been corrupted into the variants ORT, ORTS, ORS and ORTELLS, and thus possibly ORDERS. *the Anglo-Saxon name stem 'Ord-' or 'Orde-' was sometimes taken to mean 'Prince' or 'Chief'. *As a possible variant of ORDISH, from the Old English compound of Ord(a), a personal name or word suggesting a 'point', 'tip', 'extremity', 'promontory', or Ora, Old English for a topographical 'bank', and Edisc, meaning park or pastureland. This possible source of 'Orders' as a surname appears to stem from the hilly ridge near Ashover in Derbyshire known as High Oredish, reputed to be an area of rural beauty and fine views. *it may be a Scottish locational name from various minor places named with the Gaelic \\"ord\\" meaning \\"hammer\\", which is used as a topographical term for a rounded or conical hill. Notable people *James Orders was awarded a medal for his part in the Battle of Waterloo, 1815. *Jonathan Orders, English-born cricketer References ","title":"Orders"},{"id":"555942","text":"Madman (Philip Sterns) is a supervillain within the fictional Marvel Comics universe. The character is portrayed as one of the Hulk's enemies and as the brother of the Leader. Publication history He first appeared as Philip Sterns in The Incredible Hulk #363 (December 1989) and as Madman in The Incredible Hulk #364 where they were created by Peter David and Jeff Purves. Fictional character biography A former schoolmate of Bruce Banner, Sterns develops a deranged love/obsession with Banner's \\"career\\" as the Hulk. Sterns subjects himself to a multitude of experiments involving gamma-radiation to emulate his \\"hero.\\" This results in Sterns turning into a distorted monstrosity with vast superhuman strength, and develops multiple personality disorder. From this point, a much stronger, arguably deranged, personality gives him ‚Äòorders‚Äô to carry out. Calling himself Madman, Sterns hatches a plot to kill the Hulk, giving him a poison injection that rapidly deteriorates his physical state. This puts the Hulk in conflict with various members of his rogues‚Äô gallery, most notably the Abomination, turning weaker and more emaciated for every battle. Samuel Sterns, the Leader and Phillip's brother, comes to the Hulk's aid and helps him track down Madman to find the antidote. He explains that Madman \\"scares him,\\" but can't force himself to kill his brother. During the ensuing battle, Madman suffers a psychological breakdown, completely submerging his original personality, and Hulk manages to cure himself, as well as poison Madman, leaving the latter on the verge of death, with the remedy dropped barely out of reach.Incredible Hulk vol.2, #367 Later Madman reveals that he simply increased his mass to grab it, and used the time to masquerade as a researcher in the Red Skull's \\"New World Order\\" organization. Here he helped to engineer the transformation of a captured S.H.I.E.L.D. agent into the power-mimicking creature known as Piecemeal, and installed a safety override, making it answerable only to himself.Incredible Hulk vol.2, #408 When tracking the creature, he finds it in confrontation with the Hulk in the vicinity of Loch Ness, and knocks out his enemy from behind. He dumps the Hulk into the lake saddled with iron weights, but is disappointed when the latter takes longer than expected to escape. During the ensuing gang- up, Madman continues to make disorderly, deranged remarks. When Perseus, a retired Pantheon member the Hulk was visiting, tries to intervene, Madman indifferently kills him, but the Hulk punches him away.Incredible Hulk vol.2, #407-#408 While the Hulk seemingly kills Piecemeal, Madman decides to take off in a stolen jet. The Hulk overtakes and starts to dismantle the jet, and Madman triggers a pilot-chair parachute, remarking that he's not interested in killing Hulk, since it would be dull to not annoy him anymore, and detonates the plane. After landing in London, where the two superhumans called Killpower and Motormouth happen to be staying, he immediately holds the British prince Charles hostage on top of Buckingham Palace, and demands to be declared king of England. As Hulk comes to the rescue Madman states that the latter should understand the demands to use great power and shifts from crying to irreverently upbeat within seconds, dropping the prince towards the ground. The Hulk catches up to him, while Madman, after being knocked back by Motormouth, is in the middle of a temper tantrum about everybody \\"ganging up on him\\", and manages to knock him down. Madman once again voices his \\"love\\"/admiration for Hulk/Banner, but takes the opportunity to escape as the London Bridge collapses underneath them.Incredible Hulk vol.2, #409 As part of the Marvel NOW! event, Madman resurfaces and has been seen supplying gamma technology on the island of Kata Jaya. He runs afoul of Red Hulk's incarnation of the Thunderbolts.Thunderbolts vol. 2 #3 Madman was killed by Leader in his Red Leader form when he whispered something in his ear.Thunderbolts #6 After taking over Kata Jaya, the Leader makes a deal with Mephisto that allows him to observe Madman being tortured in Hell. When Mephisto later takes the Leader to Hell, he notes that they need to \\"get his brother over here with some razor blades\\". Powers and abilities Like the Hulk, Madman has vast superhuman strength. Unlike the Hulk, Madman is unable to become stronger as he becomes angrier, but he is capable of creating significant boosts in his size, density and power, being able to reach at least twice of the \\"calm strength level\\" of most incarnations.Hulk: The Incredible Guide (2003), by Tom DeFalco He once knocked out the Hulk with a single punch to the head through the advantage of surprise.‚Äô‚ÄôIncredible Hulk‚Äô‚Äô vol.2, #407 He has also claimed to be able to assume many different appearances, including the scientist spying on the \\"New World Order\\". In other media =Television= * Madman appears in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes episode \\"Hulk Vs. the World\\" as an inmate in the Cube, a prison for gamma-powered villains. =Video games= * Madman appears as one of the major bosses in the Hulk video game voiced by Paul Dobson. He works with his brother, The Leader to create a world ruled by gamma creatures (Freehold). Madman first appears kidnapping Betty Ross, and putting her in a gamma chamber. The Hulk comes to rescue Betty and battle him. He returns near the end of the game, in the Leader's base, and teams up with Halflife to kill Bruce Banner. However, Banner turns into the Hulk, and battles the duo. Madman flees in the middle of the boss fight, leaving Halflife at the mercy of the Hulk. When the base is collapsing, he tries to battle the Hulk one more time. He is presumably killed in the final fight after the Leader's base was destroyed as he was left behind.

Chelmsford ran for two series, of six and seven episodes, in 1988 and 1990. The series was set in the British town of Chelmsford in the year AD 123 and concerned the power struggle between Roman governor Aulus Paulinus (Jimmy Mulville) and the British chieftain, Badvoc (Rory McGrath). Britain is a miserable place, cold and wet ‚Äì just the place to exile Aulus for accidentally insulting the Emperor's horse but also give him something useful to do. Aulus, probably a play on Aulus Platorius Nepos, the governor of Roman Britain between 122 and 125, was a rather delicate Roman and was usually outwitted by the scheming Badvoc, who hadn't had a haircut for twenty-five years.

Building The building, designed by Branson Coates following an architectural design competition managed by RIBA Competitions, consists of four giant stainless steel drums, surrounding an atrium area, the upper floor of which has a glazed roof. Each of the drums has a rotating turret with a nozzle which is meant to turn with the wind and vent air. On the other side, an opening facing the wind takes inlet air down through wall cavities, being heated or cooled as required. Air is drawn out of the nozzle by buoyancy and wind pressure. The ground floor contained office space, a shop, a bar, a caf√© and a further exhibition space. Access to this floor was free, with only the top floor forming the museum. Closure The Centre failed to attract enough visitors and cash flow to ensure its viability for its 79 workers ‚Äì BBC News described the centre as having been \\"shunned\\" by visitors, and, despite a ¬£2 million relaunch, the Centre closed in 2000. Ticket prices were about ¬£21 for a family of four. It was hoped to attract 400,000 visitors a year. After seven months, there had been 104,000 visitors, and on 18 October 1999 the building's owners, Music Heritage Ltd, called in PricewaterhouseCoopers to administer its day-to-day running. The company was to be liquidated in that November if administration was not successful. It was saved in the interim although ¬£1.1 million was owed to 200 creditors. The estimate of visitors per year was reduced to 150,000. Martin King, the chief executive who took over from Stuart Rogers, resigned in January 2000. Just prior to closure, BBC Radio 2 held an event hosted by Billy Bragg and attended by around 75 prizewinners, to see Madness perform live with support from Paul Carrack.

The population of Wakasa is primarily located in mountain villages in a line from the southeast to northwest of the town. Most of the population is located along the Hatt≈ç River or its small tributaries. The town hosts an annual 'Yukigassen', an organised snowball fighting tournament in which up to fifty teams participate. The winners win a trip to participate in the Hokkaido grand tournament. Geography Wakasa is largely rural and located centrally in the Ch≈´goku Mountains. Prominent mountains in the town include Mount Hy≈çno(), Mount Mimuro (), ≈åginosen (), and Mount Shinbachi (). The area of the town along the border with Hy≈çgo Prefecture is part of Hy≈çnosen-Ushiroyama-Nagisan Quasi-National Park. The Hatt≈ç River (), the largest tributary of the Sendai River, emerges from Tokura Ridge on the border of Wakasa and Shis≈ç, Hy≈çgo Prefecture.

No remains from the J≈çmon (14,000 - 300 BCE) or Yayoi 300 BCE - 250 CE) periods have been found in Wakasa. The town had two or three small settlements in the Kofun period (250 - 538). Wakasa became part of Yakami District in Inaba Province early in recorded Japanese history. Settlements in the area are appeared early in the Heian period (794 - 1185), and the name of a village called Wakasa first appear in the historical record this time. The Yabe clan controlled Wakasa throughout the Heian period to the end of the Kamakura period (1185 - 1333). The Yabe built Wakasa Oniga Castle in this period. The existence of the Yabe clan and Oniga castle are noted in the Taiheiki, a Japanese historical epic written in the late 14th century. =Later history= Wakasa, located in a richly forested area of the Ch≈´goku Mountains, was a source of lumber and lumber products from early times. The production of raw timber, planks, charcoal, and firewood is noted as early as the Kamakura period. These products, as well as rice, were transported on the Hatt≈ç River for export to other parts of Japan via the Japan Sea. At the beginning of the Edo period (1603 - 1868) the Tokugawa shogunate developed land for rice paddies in Wakasa as part of a nationwide effort to increase rice production in Japan. The mountainous areas of Wakasa provided extensive irrigation for rice-producing areas in the flatlands of the lower Sendai River, but Wakasa suffered frequent flooding from the Hatt≈ç River, notably in 1815 and 1888. After the Meiji Restoration in 1868 Wakasa became part of the newly formed Tottori Prefecture. The town was officially incorporated under administrative reforms by the Meiji government in 1889. Economy Wakasa has historically been a center of the lumber trade, but is now also known for its production of daikon radish and other agricultural products. Footnotes :A.Wakasa Oniga Castle in present-day Wakasa was one of many castles with the same name. Oniga Castle in present-day Kumano, Mie was the most important among them, but others existed in Kyoto and Miyazaki prefectures.

For example, the word cleave can mean \\"to cut apart\\" or \\"to bind together\\". This phenomenon is called enantiosemy,Pages 11 and 77 in Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew, by Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Palgrave Macmillan, 2003, where \\"enantiosemy\\" is mentioned along with \\"auto- opposite\\". enantionymy (enantio- means \\"opposite\\"), antilogy or autantonymy. An enantiosemic term is necessarily polysemic.  Nomenclature  The terms \\"autantonym\\" and \\"contronym\\" were coined by Joseph Twadell Shipley in 1960 and Jack Herring in 1962, respectively. An auto-antonym is alternatively called an antagonym, Janus word (after the Roman god Janus, who is usually depicted with two faces), enantiodrome, enantionym, self-antonym, antilogy, or addad (Arabic, singular didd).  Linguistic mechanisms  Some pairs of contronyms are true homographs, i.e., distinct words with different etymology which happen to have the same form. For instance cleave \\"separate\\" is from Old English clƒìofan, while cleave \\"adhere\\" is from Old English clifian, which was pronounced differently. The King James Bible often uses \\"let\\" in the sense of \\"forbid\\", a meaning which is now uncommon, and which is derived from the Old English verb lettan 'hinder, delay, impede, oppress', as opposed to the meaning \\"allow\\", which is derived from the Old English verb l«£tan 'leave, allow, let on lease (etc.)'. The alternative meaning of \\"let\\" can still be found in the legal phrase \\"without let or hindrance\\" and in ball games such as tennis, squash, table tennis, and racquetball. Other contronyms are a form of polysemy, but where a single word acquires different and ultimately opposite definitions. For example, sanction‚Äî\\"permit\\" or \\"penalize\\"; bolt (originally from crossbows)‚Äî\\"leave quickly\\" or \\"fix/immobilize\\"; fast‚Äî\\"moving rapidly\\" or \\"unmoving\\". Some English examples result from nouns being verbed in the patterns of \\"add <noun> to\\" and \\"remove <noun> from\\"; e.g. dust, seed, stone. Denotations and connotations can drift or branch over centuries. An apocryphal story relates how Charles II (or sometimes Queen Anne) described St Paul's Cathedral (using contemporaneous English) as \\"awful, pompous, and artificial,\\" with the meaning (rendered in modern English) of \\"awe-inspiring, majestic, and ingeniously designed\\". Negative words such as bad and sick sometimes acquire ironic senses referring to traits that are impressive and admired, if not necessarily positive (that outfit is bad as hell; lyrics full of sick burns). Some contronyms result from differences in varieties of English. For example, to table a bill means \\"to put it up for debate\\" in British English, while it means \\"to remove it from debate\\" in American English (where British English would have \\"shelve\\", which in this sense has an identical meaning in American English). To barrack for anyone in Australian English is to loudly demonstrate your support, while it expresses disapproval and contempt in British English. Some words contain simultaneous opposing or competing meanings in the same context, rather than alternative meanings in different contexts; examples include blend words such as coopetition (meaning a murky blend of cooperation and competition), frenemy (meaning a murky blend of friend and enemy), glocalization, etc. These are not usually classed as contronyms, but they share the theme of containing opposing meanings. Auto-antonyms exist in many languages, as the following examples show. In Latin, sacer has the double meaning \\"sacred, holy\\" and \\"accursed, infamous\\". Greek Œ¥Œ∑ŒºŒπŒøœÖœÅŒ≥œåœÇ gave Latin its demiurgus, from which English got its demiurge, which can refer either to God as the creator or to the devil, depending on philosophical context. In many languages, a word stem associated with a single event may treat the action of that event as unitary, so it can refer to any of the doings or persons on either side of the transaction, that is, to the action of either the subject or the object, or to either the person who does something or the person to whom (or for whom) it is done. Other cues nail down the aspects of subject versus object. Thus there is a simple logic involved, despite that discussions of such words sometimes fixate on a superficial appearance of illogic (that is, \\"how can one word mean both?!\\") such as in words for borrow and lend; see #Examples below.  Examples  = English = * Bound can mean \\"tied into immobility\\" or a (or to) \\"leap or jump\\". * Cleave can mean \\"to cling\\" or \\"to split apart\\". * Clip can mean \\"attach\\" or \\"cut off\\". * Conclude can mean \\"to start\\" (a contract) or \\"to end\\". * Dust can mean \\"to remove dust (cleaning a house)\\" or \\"to add dust\\" (e.g. to dust a cake with powdered sugar). * Fast can mean \\"without moving; fixed in place\\", (holding fast, also as in \\"steadfast\\"), or \\"moving quickly\\". * Impregnable can mean \\"invulnerable\\" or \\"vulnerable\\" (to impregnation). * Let can mean \\"allow\\" or \\"prevent\\" (A British Passport contains a request that the bearer be allowed to \\"pass without let or hindrance\\"). * Left can mean \\"remain\\" or \\"leave\\" (\\"He left the room\\" or \\"He was the last one left in the room\\"). * Off can mean \\"activated\\", \\"beginning to make a noise\\" (e.g. \\"The alarm went off\\") or \\"deactivated\\" / \\"ceasing operation\\" (e.g. \\"The alarm turned off by itself\\"). * Overlook can mean to miss seeing something, or a place to see something from above. * Oversight can mean \\"accidental omission or error\\", or \\"close scrutiny and control\\". * Peruse can mean to \\"consider with attention and in detail\\" or \\"look over or through in a casual or cursory manner\\". * Ravel can mean \\"to separate\\" (e.g. threads in cloth) or \\"entangle\\". * Sanction can mean \\"approve\\" or \\"penalize\\". * Table can mean \\"to discuss a topic at a meeting\\" or \\"to postpone discussion of a topic\\". = Other languages = * Nouns ** The Korean noun Ïïû(ap) may mean either \\"future\\" or \\"past\\" (distinguished by context). * Verbs ** The German verb ausleihen, the Russian verb –æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∏—Ç—å and the Finnish verb lainata can mean either \\"to lend\\" or \\"to borrow\\", with case, pronouns, and mention of persons making the sense clear. The verb stem conveys that \\"a lending-and-borrowing event is occurring\\", and the other cues convey who is lending to whom. This makes sense because anytime lending is occurring, borrowing is simultaneously occurring; one cannot happen without the other. ** The Romanian verb a √Ænchiria means \\"to rent\\" (as the lessee does) as well as \\"to let\\" (as the lessor does). ** The Swahili verb kutoa means both \\"to remove\\" and \\"to add\\". ** In his Limited Views: Essays on Ideas and Letters, Qian Zhongshu gave some examples of Chinese auto-antonyms, like \\"Âª¢\\" meaning both \\"to abolish\\" and \\"to establish\\". He named this kind of phenomenon \\"reverse symbolism\\"(ÂèçË±°‰ª•Âæµ). ** The Persian verb ⁄Ü€åÿØŸÜ means both \\" to pluck\\" and \\"to arrange\\" (i.e. by putting objects down). * Adverbs ** and (kal ) may mean either \\"yesterday\\" or \\"tomorrow\\" (disambiguated by the verb in the sentence). ** can mean both \\"a while ago\\" and \\"in a little bit/later on\\" * Agent nouns ** The Italian and French cognates, ospite and h√¥te, respectively, also can mean \\"host\\" or \\"guest\\". Both words derive from the Latin hospes, which also carries both meanings. * Adjectives Seeming auto-antonyms can occur from translation. In Hawaiian, for example, aloha is translated both as \\"hello\\" and as \\"goodbye\\", but the essential meaning of the word is \\"love\\", whether used as a greeting or farewell. The Italian greeting ciao is translated as \\"hello\\" or \\"goodbye\\" depending on the context; however, the original meaning was \\"(I'm your) slave\\".

The ketotetroses have one chiral center and, therefore, two possible stereoisomers: erythrulose (L\\\\- and D-form). Again, only the D enantiomer is naturally occurring.  Biological Functions  There are a few known ways that tetrose sugars are used in nature. Some are seen in metabolic pathways and others are known to affect certain enzymes. = Intermediates in the Pentose Phosphate Pathway = One of the metabolic pathways that a tetrose is involved in is the Pentose Phosphate Pathway. In the Pentose Phosphate Pathway, there is an oxidative stage and a non-oxidative stage. A tetrose sugar, D-erythrose, is utilized in the non- oxidative stage, where D-ribulose 5-phosphate is generated into a 6 carbon sugar (fructose 6-phosphate) and a 3 carbon sugar (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate). Both of these molecules can be used elsewhere in the body. D-erythrose 4-phosphate is generated as a product of a reaction called transaldolation. In the Pentose Phosphate Pathway, a transaldolase removes the first 3 carbon molecules of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and places them onto a glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The transaldolase utilizes a Schiff base to perform a reverse aldol reaction and a forward aldol reaction in its mechanism, generating an erythrose 4-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate. The erythrose 4-phosphate is an important intermediate in the Pentose Phosphate Pathway because it is then used in the final non-oxidative step of the pathway. The final non-oxidative step of the pathway is a transketolase reaction. A transketolase utilizes a thiamine pyrophosphate, or TPP cofactor, to break the unfavorable bond between the carbon in a carbonyl and the alpha carbon. TPP attacks a xylulose 5-phosphate molecule and facilitates the cleavage of the bond between the C2 (carbonyl carbon) and the C3 (alpha carbon), where glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is released. Then, C2 can attack erythrose 4-phosphate, which forms fructose 6-phosphate. Both of the products of this reaction can enter the gluconeogenesis pathway to regenerate glucose. = Inhibitors of Enzymes = A tetrose diphosphate molecule, D-threose 2,4-diphosphate, was discovered to be an inhibitor of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase is the sixth enzyme used in the glycolysis pathway, and its function is to convert glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate into 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. This tetrose diphosphate molecule inhibits the G3P dehydrogenase from performing catalysis because it oxidizes the enzyme by binding to it at the active site. When tetrose diphosphate is bound to the enzyme, the active site of the enzyme is blocked; therefore phosphorolysis of G3P is unable to occur. High concentrations of tetrose diphosphate must be used to outcompete the substrate, G3P, and block the function of G3P dehydrogenase. With the function of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase lost, glycolysis cannot proceed. D-erythrose 4-phosphate was found to be an inhibitor of phosphoglucose isomerase. Phosphoglucose isomerase is the second enzyme in the glycolysis pathway, and its role is to convert glucose 6-phosphate into fructose 6-phosphate. In both of these cases, the tetrose is an inhibitor of an enzyme in the glycolysis pathway, preventing it from proceeding onward.

The 2006 census recorded that the population of the village was 1,703 - an increase of 62.1% from the 2002 Census. Ovens is within the Cork North-West D√°il constituency.  History  In Lewis' Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, published in 1837, Ovens is described under the Anglican parish name of Athnowen: :ATHNOWEN (ST. MARY), or OVENS, a parish partly in the barony of BARRETTS, but chiefly in that of EAST MUSKERRY, county of CORK, and province of MUNSTER, 1¬Ω mile (W.) from Ballincollig; containing 1953 inhabitants. This parish, which is generally called Ovens, is situated on the south line of road from Cork to Macroom, and is bounded on the north by the river Lee, and intersected by the Bride. :It comprises 4660 statute acres, as applotted under the tithe act, and valued at ¬£7594 per annum: the soil in the northern or hilly part is rather poor and stony, but in the vales extremely rich, lying on a sub-stratum of limestone forming part of the great limestone district extending to Castlemore on the west, and to Blackrock on the east. The limestone is quarried to some extent for burning into lime for the supply of the hilly districts to the north and south for a distance of several miles. :The principal seats are Grange, the residents of J. Hawkes Esq., which occupies the site of Grange abbey (said to have been founded by St. Cera, who died in 679), and includes part of the ancient walls; Sirmount of G. Hawkes, Esq., which occupies an elevated site commanding and extensive propspect over a highly interesting and richly cultivated tract of the country; Spring Mount, of S. McCarthy Esq.; Clashenure, of Kyrle Allen, Esq.; and the glebe-house of the Rev. W. Harvey. There are two boulting-mills on the River Bride; one at Killumney belonging to Mr. D. Donovan, jun.; and the other at Ovens, belonging to Messrs. R. Donovan and Sons. The petty session for the District are held every alternative week at Carroghally. The living is a rectory and vicarage, in the diocese of Cork, united by diocesan authory, in 1785, to the prebend of Kilnaglory in the cathedral church of St. Finbarr, Cork: the tithes amount to ¬£425. :The church is a neat ancient structure with a square tower crowned with pinncales. There is a glebe-house, with a glebe of 20a. 2r. 17p. In the Roman Catholic divisions this parish is the head of a union or district called Ovens, which included also the parishes of Desertmore and Aglish, and the ploughlands of Millane and Killumney, in the parish of St. Finbarr, Cork: the chapel, erected in 1835 is a handsome edifice of hewn limestone, in the mixed Gothic and Grecian styles of architecture. The male and female parochial schools are supported principally at the expense of the rector. There is also a national school, in which are 140 children, under the patronage of the Roman Catholic clergy, for which a spacious school-room has been built near the chapel. A dispensary has been established for the relief of the sick poor. :Near the bridge of Ovens over the river Bride is the entrance of the celebrated limestone caves, which Smith, in his history of Cork, describes as 18 feet in height; but from the accumulation of rubbish they are now not more than three feet high and are nearly filled with water. They branch off into several ramifications, and from the roofs of some of them depend stalactites of various forms: their dimensions have never been satisfactorily ascertained.

The area is especially rich in remains from the late Kofun period (250 - 538) AD. Hino District belonged to H≈çki Province, a former old province of Japan that covered the western part of present-day Tottori Prefecture. The district is described in the Izumo Fudoki, a detailed 8th-century record of the culture and geography of Izumo Province. The Wamy≈ç Ruijush≈ç, a 10th-century Japanese dictionary, records that the district consisted of six villages by the time of the Heian period (794 - 1185). From the middle of the Kamakura period to the end of the Nanboku-ch≈ç period, from roughly the 13th to 14th centuries, the district was controlled by the Hino and Kamonamochi clans. Various clans took control of the district in the Sengoku period (1467 - 1573), but the area was ultimately unified under the Ikeda clan, who ruled from Tottori Castle in present-day Tottori City. At the beginning of the Edo period (1603 - 1868) the district had 173 villages; by the end of the period, they numbered 165. Hino District was noted for the production of iron, steel, and tobacco in the Edo period. In 1858 Hino was separated into two districts, but records from the period indicate the borders of the area were, in general, poorly defined. Under the administrative reforms of the Meiji period (1868 - 1912) Hino District was re-established, and in 1889 consisted of 29 villages. Through various mergers the district now consists of only three municipalities. Geography Hino District stretches from roughly Mount Sents≈´ to the upper and middle reaches of the Hino River. The small plains in the valleys around the Hino River have been developed for rice production.

Pugsley, a Liberal, served as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick, Solicitor-General and Attorney-General in various Liberal governments before becoming premier in 1907. He resigned in September of that year to become minister of public works in the federal Liberal government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. He served in that position until the government's defeat in the 1911 federal election, but remained as a Member of Parliament (MP) until 1917 when he was appointed the 15th Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick. When his term ended in 1923, he was appointed to a federal position in charge of settling war claims, and held that position until his death. Pugsley was staying at King Edward Hotel when he fell ill and died of pneumonia in Toronto in 1925. He was buried in the Fernhill Cemetery in Saint John, New Brunswick.

At the end of January 31, 2011, the city has an estimated population of 53,280, with 20,945 households and a population density of 1,400 persons per km¬≤. The total area is 38.5 km¬≤. Negoroji temple was founded in the 12th century. (see also Negoro-gumi, Siege of Negoroji.) The Kinokawa River flows along the south of Iwade. Iwade was formerly located within the former Naga District until April 1, 2006, when Iwade gained city status which dissolved the district.  Municipal history  * August 1, 1908 - The village of Iwade was elevated to town status: the start of the town of Iwade (1st generation). * September 30, 1956 - During the big mergers of the Showa era, the town merged with the villages of Kamiiwade, Nera, Yamazaki, and parts of Kokura (the localities of Funado and Yamazaki). The town of Iwade was formed, with the same area of the current city. The town had the population of 13,000. The remaining parts of Kokura were merged into the city of Wakayama. * April 1, 2006 - Iwade was elevated to city status to become the ninth city in the prefecture. The prior town to become a city was Arida from Arida District on May 1, 1956. The road to city status Iwade was one of the 6 towns in Naga District, but on November 7, 2005, 5 towns merged to form the new city of Kinokawa. After the town grew to more than 50,000 people as of the 2005 census and at the request of residents, Iwade decided to gain city status alone. Iwade fulfilled the requirements to gain city status by both the ordinance of Wakayama Prefecture and Local Government Law. The cities able to gain city status alone in Japan were Tomisato in Chiba Prefecture (formerly part of Inba District) and Tomigusuku in Okinawa Prefecture (formerly part of Shimajiri District) on April 1, 2002. The only town to gain city status alone is Arida as written above, but in the Kinki Region, it has been 4 and a half years since the town Ritto in Shiga Prefecture gained city status alone on October 1, 2001. On March 3, 2006, the Wakayama Prefectural Government allowed Iwade to gain city status. It was officially announced to the government on March 17.

History Thanks to the story Inamura no Hi: The Burning Rice Fields by Tsunezo Nakai (translated and published in English by Sara Cone Bryant) and Lafcadio Hearn's Gleanings in Buddha-Fields (1897), Hirogawa (then Hiro-Mura) is often referred to the home of \\"A Living God\\": Goryo Hamaguchi (1820-1885). In 1854, Goryo Hamaguchi saved many lives from the tsunami struck the Kii Peninsula following the big earthquake. He set fires to rice sheaves (inamura) to help guide those in great danger to safety on the hilltop. He also devoted himself to help fellow villagers find jobs (hiring them) and build confidence by constructing a huge seawall. Goryo Hamaguchi and others established a private academy called \\"Taikyu-sha\\" (current Taikyu Junior/High School) to give the villagers the opportunity to learn. (According to the school record, they are not teaching the way to be successful or be famous but to be practical in many ways, such as farming and ironing.) In 1907, George Trumbull Ladd, assisting Marquis Ito (Hirofumi), visited the school and later published his journal Rare Days in Japan (1910) in the U.S. =In literature= George Trumbull Ladd briefly described his visit in another book In Korea with Marquis Ito (1908) as follows: > We had taken a trip to the village of Hiro Mura, where formerly lived > Hamaguchi Goryo, the benevolent patron of his village, whose act of self- > sacrifice in burning his rice straw in order to guide the bewildered > villagers to a place of safety when they were being overwhelmed by a tidal > wave in the darkness of midnight, has been made the theme of one of Lafcadio > Hearn‚Äôs interesting tales. Mr. Hearn, it appears, had never visited the > locality; and, indeed, we were assured that we were the first foreigners who > had ever been in the village streets. A former pupil of mine is at the head > of a flourishing school patronized by the Hamaguchi family; and having > accepted his invitation, in the name of the entire region, to visit them and > speak to the school and to the teachers of the Prefecture, the cordial > greeting, hospitable entertainment, and the surpassingly beautiful scenery, > afforded a rich reward for the three or four days of time required.

It is one of a number of such systems in use in English-speaking countries. It is related to Seeing Essential English (SEE-I), a manual sign system created in 1945, based on the morphemes of English words.Luetke-Stahlman, B. (1991). \\"Following the Rules:Consistency in Sign.\\"Journal of Speech and Hearing Research. 34:(1293-1298) SEE-II models much of its sign vocabulary from American Sign Language (ASL), but modifies the handshapes used in ASL in order to use the handshape of the first letter of the corresponding English word. The four components of signs are handshape (static or dynamic), orientation (the direction of the palm), location (where the sign is performed relative to the body), and movement (trajectory shape, trajectory size, direction of motion, and planar orientation).Kong, W. W., & Ranganath, S. (2008). Signing exact english (see): Modeling and recognition. Pattern Recognition, 41(5), 1638-1652.

Addressing the need to develop morphemic awareness en route to reading English proficiently when students are deaf or hard of hearing; documenting; the unrealized, empirically-substantiated use of Signing Exact English. Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education. History English Before 1970, children who were deaf had access to \\"oral-only\\" educations, where teachers and other adults did not use sign in the classroom. Around the early 1970s, sign began to be used more as an educational tool in \\"total communication\\" classrooms. ASL had only recently been recognized as a language and forms of Manually Coded English had just been invented. Three main reasons served as grounds for the invention of Manually Coded English, Signing Exact English (SEE), in particular. At the time, there was dissatisfaction with the levels of educational achievement of deaf children, as difficulties with syntax and morphology were impacting their writing skills. In addition, a discrepancy between hearing and deaf children in regards to knowledge of normal language development was noted. Lastly, concerns rose in regards to speech reading and the ambiguities of relying solely on speech reading.Gustaston, G. (1990). Signing exact english. In H. Bornstein (Ed.) Manual Communication: Implications for Education. (pp. 108-127). Washington, D.C. Galluadet University Press. With growing concern over the low levels of literacy and other academic skills attained by the majority of deaf students, manually coded sign systems began to develop. The first manual English System (SEE-I) was developed by David Anthony, a deaf teacher, with input from other deaf educators as well as parents of deaf children. This is known today as the Morphemic Sign Systems (MSS). This system was viewed as inadequate by other members of Anthony's team and Gerilee Gustason, a deaf woman and deaf educator, along with other members of the original SEE-I team developed SEE- II.Nielsen, D.C., Luetke, B., Stryker, D.S. (2011). The importance of morphemic awareness to reading achievement and the potential of signing morphemes to supporting reading development. Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education, 16(3) SEE-II was devised to give Deaf and hard of hearing children the same English communicative potential as their typically hearing peers. First published in 1972 by Gustasen, Pfetzing, and Zawolkow, SEE-II matches visual signs with the grammatical structure of English. Unlike ASL, which is a real language and has its own unique grammar system, SEE-II is an exact visual model of spoken English and allows children with hearing loss to access grammatically correct English, just as all hearing children receive in educational settings. SEE employs English word order, the addition of affixes and tenses, the creation of new signs not represented in ASL and the use of initials with base signs to distinguish from English synonyms.Gustaston, G. (1990). Signing Exact English. In H. Bornstein (Ed.) Manual Communication: Implications for Education. (pp. 108-127). Washington, D.C. Galluadet University Press. SEE-II is available in books and other materials. SEE-II includes roughly 4,000 signs, 70 of which are common word endings or markers. In comparison to Signed English, SEE-II involves more advanced motoric and cognitive functions.Glennen, S., & DeCoste, D.C. (1997). The handbook of augmentative and alternative communication. Cengage Learning. Handshapes Handshapes are one of the four components of a sign and convey a large amount of information about each sign. The two types of signs are static and dynamic. Dynamic signs involve hand movement and the handshape can remain the same or can change from one handshape to another. Usually only the handshapes at the start and end of a dynamic sign are important to understanding the meaning of each sign. There have been about 30-40 handshapes defined in SEE and they have many similarities to those of ASL. = SEE-II vs ASL Handshapes = ASL is a complete, unique language, meaning that it not only has its own vocabulary but its own grammar and syntax that differs from spoken English. SEE-II is not a true language but rather a system of gestural signs that rely on the signs from language of ASL to communicate in English through signs and fingerspelling. The vocabulary of SEE-II is a combination of ASL signs, modified ASL signs, or unique English signs. The reason SEE-II signs vary from ASL is to add clarity so that the exact English word meant for the conversation is understood. For example- the sign for \\"car\\" in ASL is two A hands gesturing as if they are holding onto and moving a steering wheel. This is the same sign used for any automobile controlled by a steering wheel. In SEE-II, \\"car\\" is signed by two C hands, one on top of the other, moving away from each other. To specify another vehicle, the hand shape is modified to include the first initial of the type of vehicle (e.g., V for \\"van\\", B for \\"bus\\", J for \\"jeep\\", etc.). This is called an initialized sign- the meaning of the sign is clarified by initializing the sign with the first letter of the intended English word. This allows the signer to specify exactly what they want to communicate in English. Uses Because SEE-II is a manual version of spoken English, SEE-II and its variants may be easy for English speakers to learn. Currently, the average deaf or hard-of-hearing student graduating from high school reads at approximately the third- or fourth-grade level. SEE-II has been used in hopes of promoting reading skills in deaf students. Children who grew up on SEE-II are now in their 20s and 30s and members of the Deaf Community. A small survey of 46 former students of a school in the Northwest that uses SEE indicated that many graduated from high school and attended college. Many graduate from college and obtain jobs, live independently (78.8%), drive (93.3%), and vote (88.9%). About 15% of the participants in this study receive SSI. Other advantages are: *SEE-II sign makes visible the smallest units of meaning in the English language which are difficult to hear (e.g., the word \\"boy\\" is signed differently than the word \\"boys\\"); *SEE-II sign parallels spoken and written English and is useful for children who hear speech; *SEE-II signs gives visual access to articles and prepositions and other grammatical parts of the English language; *SEE-II is easy for English speaking parents and teachers of deaf children to master because they do not have to learn a new grammar; *SEE-II is easier for non-deaf and non-verbal individuals with receptive English language skills (such as those with severe autism) to master. *SEE-II provides support for individuals who utilize cochlear implants, helping them match the SEE-II handshapes that they see with the hearing and speaking that they utilize *SEE-II can also be used if in a normal American Sign Language conversation, the signer wants to quote a hearing person's English words directly. The signer would start by signing normally, and after crediting the hearing person for their ideas, they would then switch to SEE-II and sign the quote. Once the quote is over, the signer would switch back to American Sign Language. Research The use of Signing Exact English has been controversial but in 2012 was suggested by Dr. Marc Marschark (editor of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education) as a viable support to listening, speech, English language, and reading in the schools. Some deaf people find SEE to be difficult to efficiently perceive and produce. Deaf Community members born in the 1980s were most often raised on some form of signing and speaking and do so in their adult lives. Because unlike coded manual forms of English, such as SEE-II, ASL is a naturally-evolved language, it is vitally important for children who use SEE to have opportunities to learn ASL as well. However, it is advocated by some educators as a way of providing deaf children with access to a visual form of the English language. There is research published in the Journal of Deaf Studies in Deaf Education in 2013 to evidence that SEE serves as the home language for many families although it is technically a system of communication. It allows signers to drop word medial morphemes after they can be both spoken and signed by students. For example, the sign for examination is produced with two signs: EXAM + -TION. The system assumes that since examtion is not a word in English the observer will fill in the missing parts, and students demonstrate this through their intelligible speech daily in programs where SEE is used (Northwest School for Hearing-Impaired Children in the Seattle area). Thus, the SEE-II user must first be familiar with English in order to discern the correct form. Young children must be taught which signs have incomplete English morphemic representations just as occurs when children learn to read English writing systems, just are incomplete at time but serve a valuable purpose (as does SEE). Additionally, for use of figurative language, signs must literally translate from spoken English to Signed Exact English. To learn more about SEE and its effectiveness, read the most current research available in the two major journals in the field of Deaf Education. Another argument against SEE-II is that it may not be the most efficient form of communication. ASL proponents argue that SEE-II takes the direct communications method used in the grammatical structure of American Sign Language (ASL) and fills it with English based prepositions and articles that slow down communication and make it more difficult for the communicative partners to follow along. They believe that SEE-II may be a tool for teaching English but should be limited to classroom environments. Educational controversy In the United States, about two-thirds of teachers who have deaf or hard of hearing students instruct with some sort of sign language or manually coded system; this can include ASL, SEE-II, SEE-I, or Signed/Manual English, or a combination thereof. The debate is whether SEE-II benefits children enough to justify its teaching in place of ASL which is only used by 6% of children today. Proponents of SEE-II demonstrate through research that the system is useful in helping children learn to listen, speak, understand and use English as well as read and write English as do their same-age peers. They further claim that SEE-II can exist as a practical alternative to ASL without hindering the learning of ASL, because it is easier to learn for native verbal English speakers, such as individuals with partial hearing loss or no hearing impairment. Opponents point to the logistical disadvantages of trying to promote the mainstream use of a manually coded system, which is not a real language, and dispute that SEE-II offers advantages to warrant educational resources which could be put toward encouraging universal adoption of ASL.

Situated on a small bay of the Pacific ocean and surrounded by mountains, it is a quiet and picturesque farming community of about 12,500 people. Its location has been mentioned in ancient texts since the 8th century, but the basic land area was incorporated in 1889. After a series of village mergers, the present area of Minabe was formed in 2004. Minabe is known for its high-quality apricots, known as Ume. It is also known for a high-quality charcoal called Binch≈çtan, has good fishing waters, and produces a variety of agricultural goods.  Geography  Minabe is located at the southernmost edge of Hidaka District in central Wakayama Prefecture. The main part of Minabe, including the train station, government buildings, and business district, lies around the basin of the Minabe River as it flows into Minabe Bay on the Pacific Ocean. There are three distinguishing features of Minabe Bay: Kashima Island situated approximately 1 km offshore, a long non- swimming beach that runs parallel to the central business district, and two prominent rocky points at either end. The central area of town is largely flat and comprises the majority of houses and people. It is moderately populated, with many cultivated fields and buildings. To the west-northwest of central Minabe is the Iwashiro region which is centered on the Iwashiro River Basin. This area is lightly populated and a mixture of farmland and forested mountains. It also features sections of non-swimming beaches. Following the Minabe River northeast one comes to the Kamiminabe region. This area is partly mountainous and comprises the majority of the town‚Äôs ume trees. Following the river farther upwards, the valley becomes increasingly narrow and forested, with little ground suitable for cultivation or houses. The path of the Minabe River here is narrow, no more than 30m across. There is little to nothing in the way of buildings or cultivated fields. Approximately 8 kilometers from the center of town is the lightly populated region of Takagi which features some farmland and houses. A further 6 kilometers up the river valley is the even smaller region of Kiyokawa, which is the end of Minabe. The highest point is located here: 768m. On October 1, 2004 the village of Minabegawa, from Hidaka District, was merged into Minabe. Economy Minabe is a large producer of two important agricultural products in Japan. One is Umeboshi (Japanese pickled plum). Minabe produces grows and processes more plums than any other place in Japan. The plums are primarily grown on the hillsides and mountainsides of the small valley around the Minabe River. Ume are used almost inclusively in food products ranging from the aforementioned Umeboshi to cooking sauces to ice cream. The other product is a traditional charcoal called Binch≈çtan. Minabe currently produces the second most Binch≈çtan of any place in Japan. This charcoal is produced in small, family-operated outdoor kilns primarily in the upper mountainous areas of Minabe. It is used in a wide variety of products: soaps and shampoos, ornaments, musical instruments, air fresheners, and many others. While much of Minabe's economy is agricultural, it does have several businesses and other industries. The town supports a small business district centered on its train station, as well as 3 full- service hotels and several restaurants and cafes.

Shirahama is a resort town on the south coast of Wakayama Prefecture. Its beaches has been white sand from the olden days, but some sand was imported from Perth, Australia when waves and typhoons had washed away some sand during the 1980sKansai Scene - Shirahama. Shirahama is known for its hot springs. During the summer months of July and August there are fireworks every night on the beach. Shirahama Station is about two and a half hours from Osaka by JR West's Ocean Arrow train service. There are daily flights from Nanki-Shirahama Airport to Tokyo's Tokyo International Airport (Haneda). On March 1, 2006 the town of Hikigawa, from Nishimuro District, was merged into Shirahama. As of January 31, 2012, the town has an estimated population of 23,325, with 11,149 households, and a population density of 116.02 persons per km¬≤. The total area is 201.04 km¬≤.

Two public baths in the town are part of a World Heritage site. Shirahama is one of the very few municipalities in Japan that do not have \\"azas\\", or towns and villages that were previously in the boundaries of the present-day town. White-sand beach One of Shirahama‚Äôs main attractions is its crescent-shaped white-sand beach; ‚ÄúShirahama‚Äù means ‚Äúwhite beach‚Äù or ‚Äúwhite bay‚Äù. In the 1960s, when Shirahama was connected by rail to Osaka, the city became a popular tourist destination, particularly with honeymooners, and blocky white hotel towers were erected along the coastal road. The increased development accelerated erosion, and the famous sand began to wash into the sea.

The town has the distinction of being the southernmost point of Japan's main island, Honsh≈´. The central area of town is on a narrow isthmus, surrounded on both sides by the Pacific Ocean. Kushimoto is bordered by the towns of Susami on the west, Kozagawa on the north, and Nachi-Katsuura on the east. On April 1, 2005 Kushimoto absorbed the town of Koza, from Higashimuro District, to become the new town of Kushimoto. The former town of Kushimoto was part of Nishimuro District, but the town has strong ties with the city of Shing≈´ and Higashimuro District, both for political and economic reasons. The town became part of Higashimuro District upon this merger. History Though people were known to have inhabited the area since the Asuka period, the earliest known documented settlements were established during the Edo period. During that time, most of the area that encompasses Wakayama Prefecture today was known as Kii-no-Kuni (Kii Province) or Kish≈´. The area was owned by the Kii branch of the Tokugawa clan, headquartered at Wakayama Castle. In 1791 the US captains John Kendrick of the Lady Washington and William Douglas of the Grace visited Kushimoto, hoping to open a trading relationship with Japan. News was sent to Wakayama Castle, which sent troops. However, Kendrick and Douglas departed two days before the troops arrived. The result of this first visit of Americans to Japan was largely symbolic for the United States. For Japan it resulted in a new system of alarms and coastal patrols, increasing Japan's isolation under sakoku. Kushimoto did not experience significant growth until the 20th century. It was officially incorporated into a town in Nishimuro District in 1907. Over the next decades, the town grew as a result of numerous mergers with the surrounding neighborhoods: *1924: Incorporation of Fuji-Bashi *1955: Incorporation of Arita, Shiono-Misaki, Tanami, and Wabuka *1958: Incorporation of Oshima *On April 1, 2005: Kushimoto, formerly from Nishimuro District, absorbed the town of Koza, from Higashimuro District, to become the new town of Kushimoto, now in Higashimuro District. Being in a very strategic location, Kushimoto was home to many military installations during World War II, including the Kushimoto Seaplane Base and Shiono-Misaki Airfield. Both bases were attacked by the United States Navy and Air Force in 1945, including a naval bombardment on the night of 24/25 July. Shiono-Misaki Airfield now serves as a small base for the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force. Kushimoto (or specifically, Shiono-Misaki) was the epicenter of the Great Nankai earthquake, a magnitude 8.0 earthquake that struck the area on December 21, 1946, at 4:19am. This triggered a tsunami that enveloped the central part of town. Most of the Fuji-Bashi neighborhood was destroyed but has since been rebuilt. There are memorials around town marking the event, including signposts indicating how far the tsunami had penetrated inland. Of the 269 casualties in Wakayama Prefecture, the majority were in Kushimoto and in the city of Kainan. =Name origin= There are two widely accepted views of where the name \\"Kushimoto\\" comes from. The first is explained by a strange tree growing in a shrine in Shiono-Misaki, whose seedling is thought to have floated from a far off island to its current resting place. An archaic compound form of the Chinese character for \\"kushi\\" (‰∏≤) is said to have meant \\"strange tree\\"; in combination with the second character \\"moto\\" (Êú¨), the name is supposed to represent \\"strange tree's origin.\\" Another explanation dictates that the \\"kushi\\" character is a visual abstraction of the town's layout; Shiono-Misaki and Oshima act as the smaller upper \\"kuchi\\" (Âè£) radical, while the mainland acts as the larger lower one. The \\"bo\\" (ÔΩú) radical that strikes through both of the others is said to represent the isthmus that runs through the town. Climate Owing to its location on the Kii Peninsula in the path of typhoons and the moist winds of the Kuroshio Current, Kushimoto has a very wet climate, receiving an average of of rainfall per year, though it is not quite as wet as Owase further east. The wettest month was September 1929 with whilst in January 2010 the town received no rain for the second time since records began in 1913 and had the lowest monthly humidity on record at 47 percent.Monthly Mean Relative Humidity The heaviest daily rainfall was on 17 October 1939.

The cape of Shiono-Misaki, located in the southern tip of the town, has a park and tower marking the southernmost point of Honsh≈´. The island of Oshima, connected to the main town via the Kushimoto Big Bridge, is home to two museums of foreign origin. * The Turkish Memorial and Museum, located on the southeastern end of the island, commemorates the crash of the Turkish ship Ertugrul on Oshima's shores. As of 2005, there was discussion of salvaging the wreckage with a Turkish team to exhibit it in the local museum. *The United States Friendship Museum commemorates the visit of the USS Lady Washington, which took place years before Commodore Matthew Perry's infamous landing in Japan. The museum also hosts a collection of Native American artifacts and items of nostalgia from its sister city, Hemet, in the United States. Kushimoto had been the northernmost point where coral was found in Japan, beyond the Darwin Point of 29N latitude. Nevertheless, the meandering Kuroshio warm current that normally protects the coral, led to influx of cold water in 2018 that killed off most of the coral.https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/04/20/national/meandering- kuroshio-current-behind-coral-bleaching-off-western-japan-ministry Both water too hot or too cold can bleach coral. =Water sports= The surrounding wetlands and coastal areas in Kushimoto are designated areas of conservation through the Ramsar Convention of 1971. They have since become popular spots for scuba diving, with numerous diving establishments along National Highway 42. A merger in 2004 incorporated the former town of Koza into Kushimoto. Located in the east of Kushimoto, Koza is home to the Kozagawa River. The river, regulated by the Shichikawa Dam, is one of three rivers in southern Wakayama Prefecture known for kayaking. Though waves are relatively tame compared with worldwide standards, Kushimoto is a popular surfing spot for locals and people from the bigger cities in the Kansai area. =Annual events and festivals= In late January or early February is the Shiono-Misaki Fire Festival. During this event, the large grassy field that designates Honsh≈´'s southernmost tip is ritually burned. Spectators may walk through the fire as it progresses through the field. In February is the Oshima Boat Race. Festivals grounds are set up at Oshima Port, and two boats ritually race to and from the port on the mainland Kushimoto. In August, the Summer Fireworks Festival takes place at Kushimoto Port. In October is the Sunset Marathon. The marathon's route winds through Oshima and Shiono-Misaki.

Traditional Bhutanese music includes a spectrum of subgenres, ranging from folk to religious song and music. Some genres of traditional Bhutanese music intertwine vocals, instrumentation, and theatre and dance, while others are mainly vocal or instrumental. The much older traditional genres are distinguished from modern popular music such as rigsar. Instruments Instruments used in both traditional and modern genres of Bhutanese music include the lingm (six-holed flute), the chiwang (Tibetan two-stringed fiddle), and the dramnyen (similar to a large three-stringed rebec); modern musicians often update these instruments for use in rigsar. Other traditional instruments include tangtang namborong (four-holed bamboo bass flute), kongkha (bamboo mouth harp), and gombu (bull or buffalo horn). Newer instruments include the yangchen, brought from Tibet in the 1960s. While Bhutanese folk music often employs stringed instruments, religious music usually does not. Unlike many countries, Bhutanese folk music is almost never incorporated into popular music. Religious music Bhutan was first united in the 17th century, during the reign of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal (1594‚Äì1652); the same period saw a great blossoming of folk music and dance. Religious music is usually chanted, and its lyrics and dance often reenact namtars, spiritual biographies of saints, and feature distinctive masks and costumes. Today, Bhutan has a robust tradition of monastic song and music not normally heard by the general public. The language used in these lyrics is generally Ch√∂ke. ;Cham The Cham dance is one of the most conspicuous religious musical subgenres in Bhutan, and is shared among Tibetan Buddhists in Tibet and in other countries, having roots in the 8th century. Lama and founder of Bhutan Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal is also credited with introducing many masked dances into Bhutanese tradition. Performed during modern Bhutanese tsechus (festivals), cham dances act both to achieve enlightenment and to destroy evil forces in a sort of ritual purification. Ordinary people watch cham dances in order to receive a spiritual benefit and merit. The music and choreography of the cham dance are heavily associated with Tibetan Buddhism, however some common features derive directly from the B√∂n religion. The Dramyin Cham in particular is a focal point of many modern tsechus. Folk music The influence of Drukpa Buddhism and Buddhist music on Bhutanese culture is such that many folk songs and chanting styles are derived from Drukpa music. While some lamas and monks are credited for composing certain Bhutanese folk music, the majority of its creators are unknown or anonymous. Like religious music, the lyrics of folk music are most often in literary Dzongkha or Ch√∂ke, however there are also several traditional songs in Khengkha and Bumthangkha. Vocal and behavioral discipline for traditional singing requires thorough training in order to master the correct pitch, facial expressions, gestures, and overall conduct while performing. Along with traditional music, masked dances and dance dramas are common participatory components of folk music, and feature prominently at Bhutanese tsechus (festivals). Energetic dancers wearing colorful wooden or composition face masks employ special costumes and music to depict a panoply of heroes, demons, death heads, animals, gods, and caricatures of common people. The dances enjoy royal patronage and preserve not only ancient folk and religious customs but also perpetuate the art of mask making. Bhutanese folk songs include a variety of subgenres, including zhungdra and boedra, as well as several minor varieties such as zhey and zhem, yuedra, tsangmo, alo, khorey, and ausa. Traditional song and dance are also an integral part of archery in Bhutan, known for lyrics that range from literary and sublime to provocative and burlesque. ;Zhungdra Zhungdra (Dzongkha: ‡ΩÇ‡Ωû‡Ω¥‡ΩÑ‡ºã‡Ω¶‡æí‡æ≤‡ºã; Wylie: gzhung-sgra; \\"center music\\") is one of the two dominant forms of Bhutanese folk music. It was developed in the 17th century, and is associated with the folk music of the central valleys of Paro, Thimphu, and Punakha, the heart of the Ngalop cultural area. Although considered secular, the lyrics of zhungdra songs often tell Buddhist allegories, such as Yak Legbi Lhadar, in which the singer tells of his former life as a yak slaughtered in connection with a non-Buddhist ritual in the Gasa District. Zhungdra is characterized by the use of extended vocal tones in complex patterns which slowly decorate a relatively simple instrumental melody. Untrained singers, even those with natural singing ability, typically find it challenging to sing zhungdra. This has reduced the popularity of zhungdra compared with rigsar, the fast-paced pop Bhutanese music style based on electronic synthesizers. ;Boedra Boedra (Dzongkha: ‡Ωñ‡Ωº‡Ωë‡ºã‡Ω¶‡æí‡æ≤‡ºã; Wylie: bod-sgra; \\"Tibetan music\\") is the second of the two dominant forms of Bhutanese folk music. Instrumentation for boedra often includes the chiwang, which symbolizes a horse. In contrast to Zhungdra, Boedra evolved out of Tibetan court music. ;Zhey and zhem The paired zhey and zhem (Dzongkha: ‡ΩÇ‡Ωû‡Ω¶‡ºã/‡ΩÇ‡Ωû‡Ω¶‡ºã‡Ωò‡Ωº‡ºã; Wylie: gzhas/gzhas-mo) are elaborately choreographed vocal performances often performed during tsechus (festivals). They contain elements of both zhungdra and boedra. The quick-stepped zhey are performed by men, while the more flowing zhem are women's dances. Zheys originate in the 17th century, and although there is considerable variety among contemporary zheys, most of them share common tunes and dance formats. Dancers originally performed barefoot and without any elaborate uniform, however the tradition of wearing long gowns, head gear and traditional boots was established in the 1970s. In honor of the 2011 royal wedding, Bhutanese dancers performed four major zheys (Goen Zhey of Gasa, Wang Zhey of Thimphu, Nub Zhey of Trongsa, Woochupai Zhey of Paro) and four minor zheys (Auley of Laya, Locho of Sha, Bonghur Zhey of Haa, and Miritsemoi Zhey of Chukha). The Goen Zhey is of central importance among all zheys. Its origins lie in the coming of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, the founder of Bhutan. According to tradition, when he came in 1616 to at Bangdekha below Wakeyla, a place between Gasa and Laya, the people of Goen in Gasa offered the elaborate dance. Requiring two days and 21 dancers to complete, the dance has 25 intricate steps. Dancers wear red woolen gho, black tego undershirt, and red-and-white kabney in the fashion of ancient warriors. The zheypon (dance master) wears an elaborate headdress. The Woochhu Zhey, from the Wochu Village (\\"Jackal River Village\\"; modern Woochhu Village in Lungnyi Gewog, Paro), also bases its origin in Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, first performed by a lama in the procession to receive the Zhabdrung. One particularly endangered performance is the Wang Zhey of Thimphu. According to tradition, it began with a commoner from the Wang valley who went to Laya. On his way, he stopped at the Gasa tshechu where he saw Goen Zhey for the first time. Inspired, he stayed to learn it. After returning to Wang, he taught his people the zhey in exchange for a fee of salt for every song. In 1620, with small changes, it was performed in Thimphu during the consecration ceremony of Chagri Monastery. Thereafter, it was performed regularly in receptions for important Tibetan Drukpa lamas. Though the Wang Zhey was once routine in rabneys, archery matches, and weddings of well-to-do families, it is now less frequently performed, and young Bhutanese do not know its significance. ;Tsangmo Tsangmo (Dzongkha: ‡Ωô‡ΩÑ‡ºã‡Ωò‡Ωº‡ºã; Wylie: tsang-mo), also considered a literary genre, are very popular in Bhutan. They consist of sung couplets, the first of which describes a relevant scenario, followed by the second couplet, which conveys a point such as love, hate, abuse, or ridicule. Tsangmo may be sung in a call- and-reply fashion, and may be a means of competition. ;Lozey Lozey (Dzongkha: ‡Ωñ‡æ≥‡Ωº‡ºã‡Ωü‡Ω∫‡ºã; Wylie: blo-ze), literally translated as \\"ornaments of speech,\\" refer to two distinct vocal traditions. The first is a short exchange lines, while the second is a collection of ballads that vary from region to region. They all concern traditional customs, dress, and literature. Rich in metaphor, they are known and recited by ordinary people in modern language. Like Tsangmo, Lozey may be sung in a call-and-reply fashion, and may be a means of competition. Certain Lozey are sung in vernacular language. Popular music The modern popular rigsar genre (Dzongkha ‡Ω¢‡Ω≤‡ΩÇ‡ºã‡ΩÇ‡Ω¶‡Ω¢‡ºã; Wylie: rig-gsar; \\"new idea\\") emerged in the 1960s. Rigsar can be contrasted from most traditional music in its updated electronic instrumentation, faster rhythm, and vernacular language, especially Dzongkha and Tsangla. Its context can also be contrasted, as rigsar is a common feature of Bhutanese television and film. Some of the earliest rigsar tunes were translations of contemporary popular Hindi songs. The first Bhutanese rigsar hit was Zhendi Migo, covered the popular Bollywood filmi song \\"Sayonara\\" from the film Love in Tokyo. Since the 1960s, a great number of Bhutanese artists have covered or produced a staggering volume of rigsar music. Rigsar gained popularity on the Bhutan Broadcasting Service, making way for the rigsar band Tashi Nencha to established the first recording studio in Thimphu in 1991. Prior to this period, Bhutanese people primarily listened to filmi and other kinds of Indian pop music. Rigsar is the dominant style of Bhutanese popular music, and dates back to the late 1980s. The first major music star was Shera Lhendup, whose career began after the 1981 hit \\"Jyalam Jaylam Gi Ashi\\". By the end of the 1980s, rigsar was no longer so popular, its detractors citing repetitive, simple tunes that were often copied directly from foreign music. Since 1995, with founding of the Norling Drayang recording label, rigsar has returned to relative popularity as a fusion of elements and instruments from English language pop, Indian and Nepalese music. Rigsar remains ubiquitous in Bhutan, heard in on public streets, in taxis, and on buses, and even used by the government to deliver health and sanitation education. There is also a small underground metal scene with bands like Forsaken Bhutan has also been seeing a boom in the popular music such as the B-Pop show that was held to promote creativity in May 2018 by M-Studio in collaboration with the Ministry of Information and Communications. Institutions The Royal Academy of Performing Arts (RAPA) has worked under royal prerogative to document, preserve, and promote traditional Bhutanese music, song, and dance since 1954. Its activities are overseen by the Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs of the Government of Bhutan. The Academy's performers participate in festivals, tour schools within Bhutan, and perform for tourists. The Royal University of Bhutan Institute of Language and Cultural Studies (ILCS) at Semtokha, Thimphu, was the only university level institute to offer elective courses on traditional and modern Bhutanese music, song, and dance as of 2003. Aa-Yang Ensemble, started by Jigme Drukpa in 2010, is a private performing group. The ensemble includes members from north, east and south of Bhutan, making it one of the more culturally diverse music groups in Bhutan. In 2013 the group toured Sweden for 23 days.

Taiji has long been well known as a whaling town and spearheaded the development of more sophisticated whaling techniques in the 17th century. In 1988, a ruling by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) caused Taiji to suspend commercial whaling. However, the town continues to hunt small whales and dolphins. Taiji's annual dolphin hunt is a subject of controversy and the town faces continued pressure from protest groups.  History  Taiji has been primarily known as a whaling town.Sowa, Frank: Seaside Communities in Crisis: On the Construction of Collective Identity in a Japanese Whaling Town after the Moratorium, in: Annuals of Marine Sociology/Roczniki Socjologii Morskiej, Jg. XXIII (2014), 21-35. Japanese traditional whaling techniques were developed here in the 17th century, and the commercial hunting and catching of dolphins remains a major source of income for its residents to this day. Wada Ch≈´bei organized the group hunting system (Âà∫ÊâãÁµÑ) and introduced a new handheld harpoon in 1606. Wada Kakuemon, later known as Taiji Kakuemon, invented the whaling net technique called Amitori h≈ç (Á∂≤ÂèñÊ≥ï) to increase the safety and efficiency of whaling. This method was applied for more than 200 years. The people of Taiji experienced great loss and economic hardship after an incident in 1878, when a large group of whalers were lost at sea while hunting a whale. The whale was harpooned, but was strong enough to pull the whaling boats out to sea (a \\"Nantucket sleigh ride\\"). Refusing to cut the whale loose until it was too late, many whalers drowned or were otherwise adrift and lost at sea as a result. Around one hundred whalers died in the course of this event.C. W. Nicol (1979), Taiji - Winds of Change, article retrieved 6 February 2008. After the Russo-Japanese War, Taiji's whaling industry became buoyant again as it became a base for modern whaling. When the practice of Antarctic whaling started, Taiji provided crews for the whaling fleet. In 1988, Taiji suspended commercial whaling as a result of a ruling by the International Whaling Commission (IWC). = Dolphin drive hunting = Whalers from the town of Taiji continue to hunt small whales such as melon- headed and pilot whales as well as dolphins, commercial activities which are not regulated by the International Whaling Commission. Whalers from Taiji also participate in the annual hunt for minke whales which is sanctioned under IWC regulations for scientific purposes. According to the Fisheries Research Agency, 1,623 dolphins were caught in Wakayama Prefecture; this figure represents about 13% of the total national dolphin catch for that year. In 2008, 1,484 dolphins and whales were caught. In 2009, 2,317 dolphins and whales were caught, just under the town's self-imposed quota of 2,400. =Documentary= The town's annual dolphin drive hunt was featured in the 2009 Oscar-winning documentary The Cove. Some people who appeared in the film, including Taiji assemblyman Hisato Ryono, have stated that the documentary's producers lied to them about the film's intended content. Since the film's release, more activists than before, many from outside Japan, have gone to Taiji to observe or protest the annual dolphin slaughter which usually begins in 1 September and continues through the end of February. As a result, the town announced in July 2011 that it was reinforcing its police presence at the cove where the killings take place by operating a 24-hour, 10-man k≈çban in order to prevent confrontations between activists and locals.  Sightseeing  = Museums = * Taiji Whale Museum opened in 1969. It exhibits more than 1,000 items related to whales and whaling, including skeletal displays of several whale species. It keeps captive dolphins obtained by the Taiji dolphin drive hunt on display and uses the museum as a transfer station prior to distributing animals to dolphinariums worldwide. * Hiromitsu Ochiai Baseball Museum commemorates Japanese baseball player Hiromitsu Ochiai who won the Nippon Professional Baseball triple crown three times. * Ishigaki Museum commemorates painter Eitaro Ishigaki who hailed from Taiji. His wife Ayako founded the museum in 1991. = Onsens (hot springs) = There are two small- scale onsens (hot springs) in the town: * Taiji Onsen * Natsusa (or Nassa) Onsen = Festivals = Taiji's summer festival is called the Taiji Isana Festival that is held annually on 14 August. Isana is an old Japanese word for whales. Its annual autumn festival is the Taiji Kujira Matsuri (\\"Taiji Whale Festival\\"), held on the first Sunday of November. Both festivals are heavily whale-themed and the attractions include the Kujira Odori (\\"whale dance\\") and the Kujira Daiko (\\"whale drumming\\"). The Kujira Odori is a traditional dance that whalers performed in the past to celebrate a good catch. This dance is unique, as the dancers only move their upper bodies as they dance sitting in whaling boats. It is identified as intangible cultural heritage by Wakayama Prefecture. The Kujira Daiko is also traditional and its performance describes a battle between a large whale and small whaling boats.  Transportation  = Railway = The Kisei Main Line of JR West runs through Taiji. Taiji Station is the only station in the town and is located just outside the Moriura area. A circular bus line connects the station with the tourist areas and the town hall. All Local trains and some Express trains stop at Taiji Station. = Roads = The main roads that run through Taiji are as follows: * National highway route 42 * Wakayama prefectural road route 289 * Wakayama prefectural road route 240  Education  * Taiji Elementary School * Taiji Junior High School There are no high schools or universities. Mercury concerns In 2009, hair samples from 1,137 Taiji residents were tested for mercury by the National Institute for Minamata Disease (NIMD). The average amount of methylmercury found in the hair samples was 11.0 parts per million for men and 6.63 ppm for women, compared with an average of 2.47 ppm for men and 1.64 ppm for women in tests conducted in 14 other locations in Japan. From the total population, 182 Taiji residents who showed relatively high mercury levels over 7.2 ppm, including 18 men and 5 women over 50 ppm, underwent further medical testing to check for neurological symptoms of mercury poisoning.\\"http://www.nimd.go.jp/kenkyu/report/20100427_taiji_report.pdf\\" None of the Taiji residents displayed any of the traditional symptoms of mercury poisoning, according to the institute.Matsutani, Minoru, \\"Taiji locals test high for mercury: In surprise, experts fail to discover any signs of illness\\", The Japan Times, 10 May 2010, p. 1.Matsutani, Minoru, \\"Most Taiji residents rest easy, refuse to change diet\\", The Japan Times, 10 May 2010, p. 2. However, the Japan Times reported that the mortality rate for Taiji and nearby Kozagawa, where dolphin meat is also consumed, is over 50% higher in comparison to some other similarly sized villages in other regions of Japan.Harnell, Boyd, \\"Experts fear Taiji mercury tests are fatally flawed\\", Japan Times, 23 May 2010, p. 12. However, the study makes no mention of specific causes of death nor does it mention relevant age demographics: as Taiji has 1,225 elderly residents (aged 65 years or older) and Kozagawa has 1,531 elderly residents, both towns have more elderly residents, up to twice as many, as towns mentioned in the study, such as Hiezuson, Tottori (699). The chief of the NIMD, K≈çji Okamoto, said, \\"We presume that the high mercury concentrations are due to the intake of dolphin and whale meat. There were not any particular cases of damaged health, but seeing as how there were some especially high concentration levels found, we would like to continue conducting surveys here.\\" Yomiuri Shimbun 10 May 2010 NIMD ran further tests in 2010 and 2011. Hair from 700 Taiji residents were tested for mercury; 117 males and 77 females who showed over 10 ppm underwent further neurological tests. Again, no participant displayed any signs of mercury poisoning.\\"Taiji residents relieved to hear 'it's safe' again\\", Asahi Shimbun, 31 May 2012. In August 2012, a research project to investigate the health effects of mercury on children was launched by NIMD.\\"Investigation of mercury health effect on elementary school children in Taiji\\", Yomiuri Shinbun, 7 August 2012.

It runs on the Symbian-based Series 80 platform.GSMArena - Nokia 9500 specifications The 9500 is equipped with a 150 MHz Texas Instruments OMAP processor and 64 megabytes of SDRAM. It features two screens ‚Äì a fully functional interior screen, and a restricted-function external screen, which operates on a stripped-down Series 40 user interface. Connectivity features of the 9500 include: Bluetooth, infrared, USB, Wi-Fi (Nokia's first device with Wi-Fi), CSD, HSCSD, GPRS and EDGE. It has send and receive fax facilities (without scanner) and multi-account POP3/IMAP email client. The built-in Web browser, a Nokia-branded version of Opera, is able to render both WAP and HTML Web pages. Like others in the Communicator series, the 9500 has a full QWERTY keyboard. Built-in software includes a word processor, spreadsheet and presentation program, which are compatible with the Microsoft Office suite equivalents; also featured is an MP3 player. In addition to the software applications provided by Nokia, a large range of third-party software is available; many programs written for older Nokia Communicators are compatible with the 9500 and new software can be written in C++ or OPL. The 9500 also runs Java ME applications, but some do not make full use of the unusually large and wide screen, so that many existing Java games will run, but only use the top left hand corner of the screen. It supports storage on a Multimedia Card (MMC) of up to 2 GB (on later firmware versions). The 9500 is only available with 900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 1900 MHz radios. There were many rumors that a U.S. version with 850 MHz radio capability was going to be made, but it never materialized. Nokia was producing simultaneously the 9500 and its related version, the 9300, so they decided to make a U.S. version of the 9300 instead.

The Kelham Island Museum is an industrial museum on Alma Street, alongside the River Don, in the centre of Sheffield, England. It was opened in 1982. The site The island on which it is located is man-made, resulting from the construction of a mill race, in the 12th century, which diverted water from the River Don to power a corn mill belonging to the Lord of the Manor. It is reported that the island was subsequently named after the Town Armourer, Kellam Homer, who owned a grinding workshop on the neighbouring goit (mill race) in 1637. Having remained meadowland for much of its existence, John Crowley's Iron Foundry was built on the site in 1829 and continued in operation until the 1890s. This building was replaced by a power station, in 1899, to provide electricity for the new fleet of trams in the city. These are the premises now occupied by the museum. The Museum The museum seen from across the mill race The museum houses exhibitions on science and Sheffield industry, including examples of reconstructed little mesters' workshops and England's largest surviving Bessemer converter. This object received an Engineering Heritage Award in 2004 from the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.IMechE (2009) Recognising Excellence, Past, Present and Future (Henry Bessemer's pilot converter is on display at the Science Museum (London)). The museum gives tours to local schools and has regular demonstrations of the 1905 River Don Engine, a 12,000 horsepower (9 MW) steam engine, which originally powered a local armour plate rolling mill. The engine is remarkable for its ability to change direction very quickly, a feature that was necessary for the efficient rolling of heavy steel. The engine rolled steel for nuclear reactors towards the end of its life (it was last used in production in 1978 at the River Don Works). The museum is operated by the Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust. It is an Anchor Point of ERIH, The European Route of Industrial Heritage. The Museum has a vast photographic archive which is used by authors for illustrating local history books. The Museum suffered heavily in the Sheffield flood of 2007 but is now fully redisplayed and open to the public.

The department covers a total surface area of 24,057 km¬≤ and has an estimated 2015 population of 537,306 inhabitants. The departmental capital is Juticalpa, which is also the see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Juticalpa, which covers the department. Terrain Rugged mountains rise in the western and northern portions of the department, notably the Sierra de Agalta, the Monta√±a de Tembladeros, and the Monta√±a de Botaderos. Vast pine and hardwood forests cover these mountains. Central Olancho has rolling plains, watered by the Guayape River and its affluents. These plains, sometimes called pampas due to their similarity to the vast Argentinian plains, are famous for their large cattle herds and extensive farming. The main cities, capital Juticalpa and Catacamas, are located there. The eastern part of the department is covered with rainforests, though the influx of impoverished, farmers and intense timber extraction have increased deforestation rates in the area. A portion of the Rio Platano Biosphere Reserve, a tropical rainforest with diverse wildlife and declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO, straddles the border of Olancho and the neighboring departments of Gracias a Dios and Col√≥n. The Guayape River is famous for its placer gold with concessions where today the mining company Eurocantera (Goldlake Group) exploits ethical gold. First exploited by the Spaniards during the colonial period, these gold deposits are still productive. Local men and women may be seen panning for gold in riverbanks during the dry season. Extensive gold dredging is also underway during the dry season in much of the river, including deep into the mountainous regions of the Rio Patuca (into which the Guayape feeds).  History  The Cave of Talgua, also known as \\"The Cave of the Glowing Skulls,\\" is located near Catacamas. It was used as a burial site by the native peoples, and over time, the bones left there were covered by the calcite dripping from the ceiling, giving them an eerie, sparkling appearance. Radiocarbon testing indicated that the burials were made around 900 B.C., well before the rise of the Mayans and other civilizations. The ossuary chamber was discovered in 1994 by a Peace Corps volunteer named Timothy Berg, along with two Catacamas locals named Desiderio Reyes and Jorge Y√°√±ez, and research is still being conducted in the area. In the 18th and 19th century, Olancho resisted government authority from Tegucigalpa, resulting in armed conflicts. To this day, the old independent sentiments persist among Olanchanos, although the department's role as an agricultural producer has made it an integral part of the Honduran economy. The former president of Honduras, Porfirio Lobo, hails from the department, specifically from the city of Juticalpa. Also former president now congressman Manuel Zelaya Rosales is from the city of Catacamas, also from the department There is an accurate saying about Olancho known by all residents of the region that has become the unofficial motto: \\"Olancho es ancho para entrar, y angosto para salir.\\" This is variously translated as \\"Olancho is easy to enter, and hard to leave\\", or more literally: \\"Olancho is wide to enter, and narrow to leave\\". True understanding of, and appreciation for, this motto takes years to develop. It has also been said to be because of the historical violence of the department. There is another saying, \\"Olancho: Entre si quiere, salga si puede\\" (literally, \\"Olancho: Enter if you want, exit if you can\\"). =Recent violence= The Olancho Department remains one of the most violent areas in Honduras. In June 2012, after a Drug Enforcement Administration agent killed a suspect in Honduras, it was confirmed that the US government has been running covert operations in the Olancho area to combat drug trafficking. Currently, many multinational corporations as well as charitable and religious organizations with personnel in Honduras actively discourage their members from visiting Olancho, as do the governments of the US, Canada, France, New Zealand and the UK, among others.

The documentary, which was directed and produced by American filmmakers Chris Valdes and Ted Griswold, focused on the lives of band members from Los Plebes de Olancho, a regional narco-corrido music band. The logline of the film is as follows: > Manuel, a farmer from Olancho, Honduras, seeks fame by making music for the > region‚Äôs drug cartels. When some of his song lyrics get him in trouble, > Manuel must make the most difficult decision of his life: continue the quest > for fame, or flee. Olancho premiered at the 2017 Big Sky Documentary Film Festival in Missoula, Montana. Over the course of the following two years, the film went on to screen at dozens of international film festivals, including at the Rotterdam Film Festival in the Netherlands and the Berlin Film Festival in Germany. The film earned the Special Jury Prize for Best Documentary Feature at the 2017 New Orleans Film Festival, Best Cinematography at the 2017 Tulsa American Film Festival, and Best Feature Documentary Film at the 2017 Nevada City Film Festival. Olancho is distributed by First Run Features and is now available streaming on Kanopy and for purchase on Amazon.

He is usually portrayed as the leader of the Dinobots, a subfaction of Autobots that can transform into metal dinosaurs. In 2007, USA Today polled people as to which Transformer they want to appear in the second installment in the Transformers film series; Grimlock came in tied for second with Devastator. Transformers: Generation 1 Grimlock is the leader of the Dinobots, as well as the most fearsome and powerful member. Grimlock can be cold, merciless and contemptuous of those he considers beneath him, such as human beings, and at times, even Optimus Prime himself. Nevertheless, he is a valiant warrior whose actions command respect from all who are witness to them, both friend and foe. One of Grimlock's most distinguishing features is his famous speech impediment, which leads him to shorten sentences and refer to himself constantly as \\"Me Grimlock\\", never \\"I\\". However he is still an Autobot and is willing to protect the Earth as much as the Autobots, and does also show a begrudging respect for Optimus Prime. In the animated series, Grimlock's fellow Dinobots share his speech impediment, whereas in the Marvel Comics series the other Dinobots are capable of grammatically correct speech. Grimlock is among the strongest of the Transformers, possibly an equal to, or even superior to Optimus Prime and Megatron in most continuities. In Tyrannosaurus rex mode, his powerful jaws can snap virtually anything that comes between them. He also can breathe fire and shoot an energy ray from his mouth. In robot mode, Grimlock wields an energon sword, whose blade is sheathed in crackling energon and can slice a concrete wall in one slash. He also uses a double-barreled, self-propelled rocket launcher. Grimlock is the only Dinobot whose name doesn't start with the letter S. =Reception= A Grimlock toy on display in the Natural History Museum, London. Grimlock was one of the favorite Autobots of IGN. Grimlock was voted the 6th top Transformer who was considered to be \\"badass\\" in the comics by Topless Robot.10 Transformers That Were Only Badass in the Comics By Rob Bricken, Apr. 14 2009 By Kevin J. Guhl According to X-Entertainment Grimlock was the 2nd top Transformers figure of all time. One of the original Grimlock toys is on display in the Natural History Museum, London. =Animated series= The Transformers The original character profiles written by Bob Budiansky and Dan Bobro indicate that Grimlock and the Dinobots were intended to come from Cybertron to Earth like most of the other Transformers. However, the cartoon would disregard this entirely. The discovery of fossilized dinosaur bones in a cavern in their volcano base set the Earthbound Autobots on the track to creating the Dinobots. Intrigued by the creatures, and with additional knowledge supplied by Spike Witwicky, Wheeljack and Ratchet created three \\"Dinobots\\", one of which being Grimlock. Their design specs proved to be too accurate to the creatures they were modeled on, as their primitive brains went out of control, and Grimlock and the other Dinobots almost destroyed Teletraan I, before the trio was stopped. Optimus Prime deemed them too dangerous to use again, and had them sealed back up in the cavern, but when the majority of the Autobot forces was captured by the Decepticons, Wheeljack freed them to go to their rescue. Equipped with new devices that enhanced their brainpower to functional levels, the three Dinobots successfully rescued their Autobot comrades, and Optimus Prime admitted his error. In his private thoughts, however, Grimlock considered Optimus Prime too weak to lead, seeking the position for himself. When Soundwave read his mind and learned of this animosity, Megatron was able to trick Grimlock and the Dinobots into switching sides, attacking and capturing Optimus Prime. To stop the turncoat Dinobots, two new ones were created: Snarl and Swoop. Ultimately, it was when Optimus Prime threw himself into harm's way to save Grimlock from an explosion that he accepted his mistake and rejoined the Autobots. In a rare display of modesty and humility, Grimlock emotionally apologized to Prime, admitted his jealousy of the leader, and accepted fault for the battle. The two subsequently patched up their differences. Although content for the moment to remain a soldier, rather than a leader, Grimlock still had trouble accepting orders, only agreeing to help stem the tide of natural disasters ravaging Earth due to Cybertron being pulled into its orbit when he realized he would die if he did not. Grimlock and the Dinobots were semi-regularly called into action when the Autobots were faced with challenges that required extra strength, such as the Sub-Atlantican invasion of Washington, D.C., or the Decepticons' control of the TORQ III supercomputer; with every piece of help he and his troops gave, Grimlock was never slow to add a scathing remark about the inabilities of the Autobots. That said, he was not unwilling to admit the failings of his own troops, either, and willingly took them to the time-displaced \\"Dinobot Island\\", where they trained in the wilderness and helped stop a Decepticon raid on the prehistoric paradise. The final straw for Grimlock came when he and the Dinobots were injured in a Decepticon trap at an airfield. Enraged, Grimlock refused to take orders from Optimus Prime anymore, and he and the other Dinobots left. When the Autobots began to suffer from Cybertonium deficiency, Spike Witwicky and his girlfriend Carly attempted to persuade the Dinobots - who continued to function perfectly, as they had been built on Earth without Cybertonium - to steal some of the mineral from a Decepticon shipment coming in from Cybertron. Grimlock instead opted to lead the Dinobots to Cybertron itself, where they were captured by Shockwave and put to work in the Cybertonium mines, until Swoop, Spike and Carly rescued them. Brought back to Earth, the Dinobots agreed to follow Prime's order again - until such time as Grimlock did not feel like it. By 2005, it seemed apparent that Grimlock had undergone some degree of a personality change, becoming more childish and petulant, rather than brutish and stubborn. He and the Dinobots accompanied Optimus Prime on the latter's rescue mission to Autobot City, and fought Devastator. Subsequently, the Dinobots joined Hot Rod and his companions in traveling back to Cybertron to face the evil Unicron. Also of note, it seemed that, along with the other Dinobots, Grimlock remained in his dinosaur mode almost exclusively, rarely changing back to his robot form. Throughout 2006, he regularly participated in missions with his fellow Autobots rather than the other Dinobots, battling on the planets of Chaar, Goo, Dredd and Eurythma. In episode #78, \\"Madman's Paradise\\", Spike and Carly hosted a banquet for a visiting ambassador. Their son Daniel got bored and wandered off. Grimlock followed him, and they fell into a lost chamber where Quintessons banished their criminals to other dimensions. They slipped through to the other- dimensional realm of Menonia, and were tricked into fighting on the Red Wizard's side, only to find out that he was the Quintesson criminal, who overthrew the Golden One. Ultra Magnus, Blaster, Eject, Rewind, Ramhorn, and Steeljaw followed, and using Blaster's amplification, they help the Golden One defeat the Red Wizard. With the help of Perceptor, the Autobots and Daniel are returned to Cybertron. Grimlock helped to sniff out the \\"dinosaur transform static\\" that implicated Trypticon in the theft of world monuments. Later in the year, when Galvatron, the new Decepticon leader, had Cybertron infused with function-inverting anti-electrons, a dose of the particles gave Grimlock super-intelligence. For the first time Grimlock identified himself as \\"I, Grimlock\\". During a mission to Unicron's disembodied head, where the Autobots were outmatched by the new Decepticon Terrorcons, Grimlock used components of Unicron's head to construct the Technobots to battle them. Combined as Computron, the Technobots felt they could not match the Terrorcons, until Grimlock transferred his super-intelligence into Computron, reverting to his old self and allowing the Autobots to claim victory. Grimlock's greatest victory came when he and a large number of other Transformers with primitive animal-themed transformations were summoned to a world at the centre of the galaxy by the ex-assistant of the ancient genius, Primacron, creator of Unicron. The assistant had assembled these \\"Primitive\\" Transformers in the hope that their simple instincts could defeat Primacron's newest creation, Tornedron, but one by one they fell to him, with Grimlock apparently crushed under Trypticon. Grimlock survived, however, and followed Tornedron back to Primacron's lab. When Tornedron turned on his master, like his predecessor, Primacron's complicated plans and equations could not find a way to stop him; Grimlock, on the other hand, randomly flicked a switch which reversed Tornedron's energy polarity, undoing the damage the now dissipating Tornedron had done. Grimlock decimated Primacron's lab while dancing around over his successful saving of the universe, dubbing it the smartest thing he'd ever done. In 2011, the Decepticons invaded Cybertron in full force. Grimlock was deployed by Wreck-Gar to fend off the invaders. He was seen fighting alongside his fellow Dinobots as well as the Throttlebots against the invading Decepticons, however, they didn't fare too well against the Decepticon Headmasters, as they are all quickly put to sleep by Mindwipe's hypnosis attack. In the second episode, Grimlock was again in action, trying to protect Vector Sigma along with two fellow Dinobots and Jazz. After the animated series ended in the US Grimlock appeared in animated form one last time in the commercial for the Classic Pretenders. =Books= Grimlock was featured in the 1985 Find Your Fate Junior book called Dinobots Strike Back by Casey Todd. Grimlock appeared in the 1986 story and coloring book The Lost Treasure of Cybertron by Marvel Books. Grimlock was featured in the 1993 Transformers: Generation 2 coloring book \\"Decepticon Madness\\" by Bud Simpson. =Comics= 3H Enterprises Although no Grimlock toy was made in the Transformers: Universe toy line, both Grimlock and his Transformers: Robots in Disguise counterpart appeared in the storyline. The Autobots returning to Cybertron along with Blackarachnia and Silverbolt were then abducted via teleportation beams and taken to Unicron. Tap-Out, Transformers: Armada Megatron, Brawn, War Within Grimlock and Snarl were also abducted from various timelines (Transformers: Universe #1). War Within Grimlock, Armada Megatron and Universe Optimus Primal are each transported to the Unicron world, where they eventually team up and fight Striker and Reptilion. Note, there is a small continuity error in that this story ends with Grimlock, Megatron and Primal standing over Reptilion, but issue #2 of the comic starts with them standing over Striker (2003 Botcon Voice Actor Play). After the events of the Botcon 2003 voice actor play, Optimus Primal is able to use his spark telepathy to free Striker from Unicron's influence. Optimus Primal, Megatron and Grimlock help break free the slaves from various timelines which are held there and gets them to Cybertron (Transformers: Universe #2). Condor Verlag In a story called \\"By their Blasters you shall know them ...!\\" from Transformers Comic-Magazin issue #12 by German comic publisher Condor Verlag Optimus Prime instructs Backstreet, Bumblebee and Ruckus on how to identify Autobots from Decepticons in battle using the Ark's computer. Pretender Grimlock is one of those he displays to the Autobots. He is identified as a Decepticon. Devil's Due Publishing Grimlock also appeared in several of the G.I. Joe vs the Transformers series from Devil's Due Publishing. In 2004 Grimlock was among the Autobots under the leadership Optimus Prime who attempted to take back the planet Cybertron from the Decepticon tyrant Shockwave. After an accident with the teleportational systems of the supercomputer Teletran-3, Grimlock found himself sent back in time and on the planet Earth. He was reformatted in the form of an Earth dinosaur with several other Autobots. A group of humans were able to bring the new Dinobots back to Cybertron and they helped overcome Shockwave. Grimlock returned in the third series as a main character. Grimlock, Arcee, Bumblebee and Perceptor were sent to Earth to aid G.I. Joe in removing the influence of Cybertronian technology on the planet. When Cobra attacked the base, the Autobots helped repel the Cobra Battle Android Trooper armies. This was simply a distraction, however, to allow Cobra Commander access to the real prize - Serpent O.R., a technorganic android created from the DNA of many great warleaders and parts from Megatron. Predictably the Megatron aspects took control and Serpent O.R. escaped, taking over the G.I. Joe battlesuits and forcing Grimlock and the other Autobots to battle them while he made his escape. The Autobots and Joes pursued him to Cybertron, where they were captured by Serpentor, the Predacons, the Seacons and the Stunticons. While Serpentor captured Optimus Prime, Snake-Eyes led a jailbreak, with Grimlock flattening Rampage in the process. He would then form part of the combined Autobot/G.I. Joe strike force to rescue Optimus Prime, at one point ripping a Decepticon prisoner's arm off to gain Prime's location. At the end, after Serpentor's defeat and Prime's rescue, Grimlock admitted he was wrong about the Joes, and that they were great heroes, warriors and friends. There is a notable disparity in Grimlock's speech patterns between the second and third series. In the second series he is seen to speak normally, referring to himself as \\"I\\". However, in the third series he speaks in his more normal \\"Me Grimlock\\" speech. Dreamwave Productions The 21st century re- imagining of the original universe by Dreamwave Productions depicted Grimlock in a manner similar to his depiction in Marvel Comics - a powerful, cunning warrior who values strength of body and character. Through Transformers: The War Within, the company shaped a background on Cybertron for Grimlock which showed that he had participated in the planet's underground gladiatorial game in order to unleash the rage and anger he had always overflowed with. When Megatron began using the games to identify suitable soldiers for his burgeoning Decepticon army, Grimlock was recruited by him and initially fought on his side, befriending Starscream and perhaps the scientist, Jetfire, before defecting to the Autobots - not out of any particular fondness for them and their ideals, but rather out of sheer hatred of Megatron and his ideals. He still bears a particularly fierce grudge against Jetfire over an unspecified incident with a cerebro-shell. During the time Autobot leader Sentinel Prime was killed, Grimlock was an established, respected member of the Autobots (perhaps most remembered for his quote \\"Me Grimlock, badass!!!\\"). Grimlock questioned the new leadership of Optimus Prime, including Prime's first major decision to evacuate Cybertron over defending it. Witnessing and aiding him in battle with Megatron deep beneath Cybertron, however, Grimlock came to respect Prime as time passed. When Prime and Megatron disappeared in an early test of the experimental spacebridge transport system, disarray struck the Autobot and Decepticon ranks and they splintered off into numerous smaller factions - Grimlock founded the Lightning Strike Coalition to fight the battles he considered the most important. As the \\"Dark Ages\\" came to an end, Ultra Magnus reunified the various Autobot factions, with Grimlock becoming something of his right-hand man. Starscream's Predacon faction attacked an attempted peace treaty between the Autobots, the Decepticons and Ratbat's Ultracons. As Grimlock leapt to Ultra Magnus's defence, he apparently perished - naturally, we know he later returned to life, but unfortunately, due to Dreamwave's closure, this story was never resolved, and Grimlock's restoration to life was left unexplained. What is known of the remainder of his time on Cybertron, however, is that he, Slag, Sludge, Snarl, and Swoop formed a team known as the \\"Dynobots\\" (they are referred to as such in the first issue of \\"The Age of Wrath\\"). The Dynobots remained on Cybertron when Optimus Prime left on The Ark, pursued by Megatron. When Optimus Prime and Megatron's troops vanished four million years ago, they pursued the Decepticons known as the Insecticons, who had set off in search of the missing leaders. The two teams battled on prehistoric Earth, and the battle ended with both sides trapped in stasis. The eventual awakening of Prime and Megatron's forces in 1984 was followed by the Autobots' discovery and reactivation of the Dynobots, now rechristened the \\"Dinobots\\" for their new dinosaur alternate modes. When the Transformers were all believed destroyed in the explosion of the ship that was taking them back to Cybertron, several of them, including Grimlock, were recovered by a rogue military faction and reprogrammed so that they could be operating as killing machines. Bumblebee, Frenzy, Grimlock, Laserbeak, Prowl, Ravage, Soundwave and Starscream were forced to attack the Smitco oil refinery in the Arctic to display their power for sale to the highest bidder. When Megatron liberated himself and several others from this control, Grimlock, tired of risking his life for the humans, joined him, ripping off his insignia and joining in the Decepticon attack on San Francisco, during which he was dispatched from behind by Trailbreaker. Left behind by the fleeing Decepticons, he subsequently located and liberated the other Dinobots, and headed for Cybertron. In the four-million-year interim, the planet had been unified by Shockwave for his own sinister ends, but once there, Grimlock led an assault on Iacon, providing enough chaos and unrest for Optimus Prime's Autobot underground to overthrow Shockwave's rule of Cybertron. Grimlock successfully hauled Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus to safety when Shockwave's citadel exploded. Grimlock's Pretender form is given an entry in the seventh issue of the More Than Meets the Eyes profile series, indicating there may have been plans to make him a Pretender at some point in the Dreamwave universe. Dreamwave's closure meant that they would tell no further stories of their Grimlock, although his \\"War Within\\"-era design did appear in the Transformers: Universe comic book exclusive to BotCon. Grimlock also appeared in the Dreamwave Transformers/G.I. Joe comic. Although not one of the Dinobots in this continuity, transforming into a Sherman Tank, this Grimlock shared the rebellious attitude and speech mannerisms of other incarnations of the G1 character, although he had a softer attitude towards humans. Reactivated by G.I. Joe to fight the Decepticons and Cobra, Grimlock battled Cobra forces and Rumble alongside Roadblock, although the Decepticon's piledriver arms nearly defeated them, with Grimlock telling Roadblock to leave him, until Bumblebee and Scarlett intervened. When Snake Eyes opened the Matrix on Prime's command, Grimlock was presumably deactivated. Fun Publications =Classicverse= Based on the Transformers Classic toy line, the Timelines 2007 story is set 15 years after the end of the Marvel Comics story (ignoring all events of the Marvel UK and Generation 2 comics). When Bludgeon and his Decepticons were banished after the battle of Klo Grimlock refitted his Decepticon battleship, the Graviton, with weapons and recruited his several Dinobots and Autobots to hunt them down. The crew included Ultra Magnus, Springer, Huffer, Elita One, Snarl, Terranotron and the Mini-Cons Swoop and Strongarm. After getting word from Optimus Prime that Megatron was alive on Earth Grimlock left Ultra Magnus in charge of the Graviton and took a shuttle to Earth. In the story Crossing Over by Fun Publications Grimlock was among Autobot troops of Optimus Prime who responded to the sighting of Megatron and arrived in time to save the dimensional traveling Autobot Skyfall from Megatron's wraith. In Games of Deception the Graviton follows Bludgeon's agent Bugbite and several Decepticons to Earth where the Autobots join up with Grimlock. After a brief encounter with the Decepticons the Graviton leaves with Grimlock joining them. Classic Grimlock's biography was featured in issue #13 of the Transformers Collectors Club magazine. Grimlock appears in \\"Beast Wars Shattered Glass Chapter One: Shattered Time\\" by Fun Publications. In this story Ultra Magnus and the Autobots aboard the Graviton battle Megatron and the Decepticons aboard the Talon. Both ships are pulled through a vortex into the past of Shattered Glass Earth. Crashing they discover that dangerous energon readings outside the ship will place them in stasis lock. The Autobots devise organic alternate modes to protect them from the energon. The Decepticons create energon-absorbing armor for protection. Grimlock takes on the alternate form of a white velociraptor (his Beast Wars toy). This team of animal-based Autobots eventually renamed themselves \\"Maximals\\" after encountering a member of that faction from an alternate universe. Grimlock and his fellow Maximals eventually joined forces with the heroic Decepticons-as opposed to their Megatron's renamed Predacons-under Galvatron. This would lead to Grimlock joining Galvatron in coming to the aid of Decepticon City on Earth when it was attacked by the Autobots in an effort to break the Decepticon war effort once and for all. Grimlock would be sent in to attack Superion, only to be overpowered after letting his guard down due to the humor-in his eyes, at least-of a Combiner made up of Micromasters. Fortunately, the Micromaster Predacons came to his aid and thwarted Superion's assault. =Wings Universe= Kup told the Dinobots and Rodimus the story of how he became a member of the Autobot Elite Guard. =Beast Wars: Uprising= Grimlock was also featured in the Beast Wars: Uprising storyline as a member of the Maximal-Predacon resistance movement instigated by Lio Convoy. Having transplanted his Spark into a Maximal protoform to avoid the immobility common among his fellow Autobot and Decepticon \\"Builders,\\" Grimlock launches a violent campaign seeking to topple the old regime and bring Cybertron under resistance rule. However, his extreme agenda eventually leads him to steal the G-Virus, a contagion born from the essence of the fallen Galvatron with the ability to remake any Cybertronian in his image. Grimlock soon leads his team to a gladitorial event, intent on unleashing the virus on the spectators, only to have the now Micromaster Hot Rod interfere. One of Grimlock's own subordinates then destroys most of the virus, unaware that a Cybertronian has already been affected and been turned into a new Galvatron.https://www.transformersclub.com/prose/Beast-Wars-Uprising-Micro- Aggressions-V1.01.pdf IDW Publishing In a flashback in Maximum Dinobots #1 Grimlock lead the Dinobots in taking a Decepticon energon silo in Sub-Sector Nine on Cybertron. In the Transformers Spotlight issue on Shockwave, Grimlock and the 'Dinobots' (sporting Cybertronian designs much like their War Within designs) appear in a story that partially pays homage to their Marvel G1 origin. Seeking payback for a humiliating defeat by Shockwave, Grimlock pursued him to prehistoric Earth (which Shockwave was seeding with Energon). In order to protect themselves against Energon surges, the Dinobots required alternate modes covered by a layer of synthetic flesh. Refusing to pick dying and thus weak Ice Age mammals for an alternate form, Grimlock chose to utilise more ferocious dinosaurian beast modes which were much more impressive. The Dinobots got the initial jump on Shockwave, as their attack was too illogical for him to understand, but he quickly recovered and dispatched the entire team, destroying their synthetic skins and sending them into stasis lock. Grimlock got the final laugh, as the Dinobot ship fired a pre-programmed blast into the surrounding volcanoes to unleash a flow of lava that engulfs all six Transformers until they were uncovered by human paleontologists in 2006. Following this, Skywatch, a government agency who knew about Transformers, took over the site. Later, following escalating Transformer activity on Earth (as seen in The Transformers: Devastation), and losing control of their other captive Transformers Ravage and Laserbeak, Skywatch reactivated Grimlock as a response. The reawakening was sabotaged by the Machination, and Grimlock escaped. He met Scorponok, who proposed an alliance as they were both now fugitives. Grimlock refused, but lost the subsequent battle, teleporting himself to the Dinobot ship. Vowing to bring down Scorponok, he was unaware the Machination were manipulating Skywatch into reactivating the other Dinobots, with the aim of having them dispose of Grimlock (Spotlight Grimlock). Following their acquisition of the Transformers licence in 2005 IDW Publishing released a comic book series which takes place during the Beast Wars animated series, but features the toys and characters who did not appear in the show itself. The Beast Wars incarnation of Grimlock appeared, as a gigantic white Velociraptor-type dinosaur, and it was revealed that Grimlock was among those in protoform stasis on the Axalon, and like the others was launched into space in the series pilot. He fought against Predacon leader Magmatron in a one-on-one battle but lost the upper hand when Magmatron split into three separate beast forms, which attacked him simultaneously; in the long run however, he provided the necessary distraction for the Maximals to steal Magmatron's Chronal Phase armband, leading to his ultimate defeat. Grimlock has since joined Razorbeast's Maximal team. After the defeat of Magmatron's Predacons the united group of Maximals awaited rescue from Cybertron. He appears among the Maximals on the cover of the first issue of the sequel story Beast Wars: The Ascending. In the beginning of Beast Wars The Ascending Razorbeast speaks to Prowl and Wolfang about how he feels there is no rescue mission coming for them from Cybertron as Grimlock hunts in the nearby woods. In Beast Wars: The Ascending #4 Grimlock was among the Maximals and Predacons returned to Cybertron to battle Shokaract. Grimlock had a biography printed in the Beast Wars Sourcebook by IDW Publishing.Creators of Transformers: Beast Wars: The Gathering are back =Dawn of the Predacus= Grimlock also features briefly in the comic story \\"Dawn of the Predacus\\" in which his exposure to transmatter turns him into a protoform, heralding his eventual role in Beast Wars fiction. As he is placed in a stasis pod he is looked upon by Predacon-and future Maximal-Dinobot, possibly indicating where the warrior took his future name. Manga In the Japanese manga \\"Big War\\" #2, the Autobots Rodimus Prime, Grimlock, Kup and Wheelie, along with their human allies Spike Witwicky and Daniel Witwicky send Computron into battle against Galvatron's new warrior combiner Abominus. The Terrorcons spit \\"corrosive control liquid\\" against Computron, taking control of him and turning him into a Decepticon. Spike luckily uses his new Exosuit to free Computron with \\"defense spray\\". Defeated, Galvatron retreats. Marvel Comics Since Marvel Comics' Transformers series were primarily written by Bob Budiansky in its early years, the writer was able to present his origin for the Dinobots as he had originally conceived it. Hence, when the Ark crashed on Earth four million years ago, it was followed down to the planet by the Decepticon Shockwave, who touched down in the prehistoric region of Antarctica known as the Savage Land. The Ark's computer detected his presence on the planet, and its scans of the Savage Land led it to believe that dinosaurs were the dominant life form. Thus, it reconstructed Grimlock and his troops into dinosaur forms, in order to battle Shockwave. Unfortunately, he slyly outmaneuvered them and managed to pick them off at a distance with his superior firepower; knocking them into a tar pit one by one. With their final strike the battle ended in a stalemate as the Dinobots made him fall in the pit along with them, buried under a rock slide for several million years. In 1984, when Shockwave was accidentally reactivated by an Autobot probe and took command of the Decepticons from Megatron, Autobot medic Ratchet entered into an uneasy alliance with the deposed Decepticon leader, agreeing to recover the Dinobots so that they might defeat Shockwave again. Ratchet pulled a double-cross, however, and had the Dinobots attack Megatron instead, resulting in a battle that ended with Megatron's disappearance. Grimlock steadily grew more and more displeased with Optimus Prime's leadership, and eventually broke his Dinobots away from the main Autobot faction. After a prolonged period living in self-imposed exile, the news of Optimus Prime's death brought Grimlock back to the Autobots. After proving his worth by defeating the Decepticon Trypticon, Grimlock was elected leader of the Autobots. It soon proved that people with power, especially a lot of power, are more likely to be corrupt. Grimlock became a tyrannical ruler who led the Autobots with an iron fist. His policy towards Earth and its inhabitants were vastly different from Optimus Prime's ‚Äì instead of viewing them as objects of protection, Grimlock expressed a disdain for humanity, viewing them as an inferior species unworthy of their protection. Under Grimlock's leadership, the Ark was repaired and made space-worthy again. In issue #32, titled \\"Used Autobots\\", Wheeljack completed work on his Geothermal Generator, which used the heat from the volcano the Ark had crashed in to generate energon cubes. Although Wheeljack thought this would impress Grimlock by reducing their dependence on human help, Grimlock seemed to think the Autobots should just take what they need from the humans. Blaster and Goldbug could not endure Grimlock's leadership any more, and set out on their own, only to have Grimlock mark them as traitors. Blaster was hunted down by the Protectobots and later the Dinobots themselves, and placed under imprisonment and torture. When the Autobot Headmasters and Targetmasters arrived from Nebulos, Grimlock refused to recognize the authority of Fortress Maximus and failed to establish an allegiance with his group. This proved to be the last straw for the Autobots under Grimlock's command, who collectively conspired to overthrow him, arranging for Blaster to challenge Grimlock for leadership. During their battle on the moon, the Decepticons took advantage of this weakness in the Autobot ranks and interrupted the duel with an all-out assault. With all Autobots now under attack from their mortal enemies, Grimlock and Blaster put their differences aside and fought alongside each other against the Decepticon horde. Subsequently, Fortress Maximus orchestrated the recreation of Optimus Prime as a Powermaster, and Grimlock stepped down as leader. Grimlock and the Dinobots were destroyed during the battle against Starscream while the villain was super-powered by the Underbase. Grimlock was seen among the Autobots being repaired on the Ark when Optimus Prime sent Landmine and Cloudburst on their mission to obtain computer chips to repair fellow Autobots in issue #52, \\"Guess Who The Mechannibals Are Having For Dinner?\\" Grimlock's body was seen among the deactivated Autobots Ratchet was doing his best to revive in Transformers #56, \\"Back from the Dead\\". After a short time, Grimlock (along with Jazz and Bumblebee) was rebuilt by Ratchet as a Pretender. Ratchet shortly after was lost in a transport incident while taking out Megatron, and was thus unable to continue his work restoring other Autobots in stasis lock (Ratchet later returned, physically merged with Megatron). Grimlock swore to one day find a way to revive his Dinobots. Under the leadership of Powermaster Optimus Prime, Grimlock proved to be a loyal and powerful Autobot, daring even to battle the Matrix-powered Decepticon Thunderwing during the Matrix Quest. However, he was still obsessed with quickly reviving the Dinobots, a goal which put him at odds with Optimus Prime, who advocated patience in the search for a way to rebuild the fallen Autobots. Grimlock finally lost patience, stole the bodies of the Dinobots and a shuttle from the Ark, and piloted it to the planet Hydrus Four, where scientists had developed a new fuel called nucleon. It was more powerful than energon and capable of bringing dead Transformers back to life, but it was unstable and could have unforeseen consequences. Grimlock was unwilling to subject his Dinobots to anything he would not go through himself, and thus decided to test the fuel on himself first. When no ill effects were apparent, he used it to revive the Dinobots, and brought enough back to revive the remaining fallen Autobots. The Dinobots returned to Cybertron with the nucleon, and arrived in time for the battle with Unicron. Their arrival, and their reviving the fallen Autobots with Nucleon, was an important part of Transformer victory that day, but Optimus Prime once again lost his life, sacrificing himself to destroy Unicron, and once again naming Grimlock as his successor with his dying breath. Before Grimlock could celebrate his new position, however, the Nucleon's effect on Transformers became apparent. Grimlock began to experience brief bursts of immobility, his joints locking, which reached a peak when he became completely paralyzed in Cybertron's wastelands while he and the Dinobots were under attack by monstrous creatures from beneath Cybertron's surface. Realizing that Grimlock had become trapped in a \\"chrysalis\\" stage, Prime's Powermaster partner, Hi-Q, tapped into and accelerated the process, completing Grimlock's evolution into a more powerful \\"Actionmaster\\" ‚Äì but the enhanced power came with a price: Grimlock was now no longer able to transform into dinosaur mode. At that point, Cybertron was believed to be dying as a result of the battle with Unicron, and the Autobots and Decepticons were co-operating to evacuate. However, the Decepticons had a hidden motive: to escape, and leave the Autobots marooned on the dying planet. Grimlock and the Dinobots were the only ones among the Autobots who saw through the Decepticons' false pretense of peaceful co-existence and suspected the plan of mass betrayal. When the Decepticons sabotaged the Autobots' ships and fled the planet, Grimlock saved the Autobots. He revealed that he had captured Decepticon ships after a strike against them before the voyage to Earth, and had hidden them away. Thanks to those ships, the Autobots were able to flee Cybertron and follow the Decepticons to the planet Klo for a final showdown. Unfortunately Decepticon leader Bludgeon had discovered the Autobot homing beacon and laid a trap for them. Grimlock's stubbornness meant the Autobots walked right into it, decimating them. Grimlock was one of the few survivors, and when Optimus Prime returned, recreated by the Last Autobot, Grimlock participated in the rout of the Decepticons. While the monthly Transformers comic was published in the United States, its sister title in the United Kingdom reprinted its stories, and included many of its own original tales, interspliced with the running American narrative. The author of these stories, Simon Furman, was particularly fond of Grimlock, often using him for his original stories, and even using the character for responses on the readers' letters page. Furman truly transformed Grimlock, from the brutish tyrant of the early American comics into a noble anti-hero. Set in and around the U.S. stories, Grimlock and the Dinobots were the stars of several stories while self-exiled from the other Autobots, including In The National Interest where they tried to help expose the Robo-Master hoax. When leader of the Autobots, Grimlock was involved in assisting Action Force battle Megatron in London and attempted to kill the Predacon Divebomb in order to silence embarrassing facts about Swoop's past. Towards the end of the series, the UK comics began a break-away storyline that branched off from the continuity of the American stories, beginning with Grimlock's decision to once again break his Dinobots away from the main Autobot force. Tired of Prime's pacifistic approach to protecting Earth, Grimlock was joined by several older Autobots like Prowl and Wheeljack, who had just recently been reactivated, and longed for the older, simpler days. Under Grimlock's command, they formed the Earthforce, a pro-active Autobot group based in Canada who regularly battled the two Decepticon forces under the commands of Megatron and Shockwave. Issue #279 of the Marvel U.K. Transformers comic featured a story called \\"Divide and Conquer!\\" where Soundwave lead the bulk of the Decepticon forces on Earth against the Autobot Earthforce headquarters while Starscream attacked an oil tanker. Sent into battle by Prowl, the Dinobots routed the main Decepticon forces while Springer lead the Autobot Survivors, Broadside, Inferno, Skids, and Carnivac to defeat Starscream. There was no specific ending for the Earthforce crew, but the issue of nucleon was resolved in a one-shot text story contained in the final Transformers annual (a hardback book containing new material released each year). Of the Dinobots, only Slag retained the ability to transform, until the discovery of new nucleon allowed all the Transformers previously empowered by it to regain their transforming abilities. The place in continuity of this tale is hard to determine. It followed on from the events at the conclusion of the American series, yet cannot fit in with American continuity as it puts Megatron in a situation he cannot possibly be in. A few years after the conclusion of the original Transformers comic, the line was given a shot in the arm with the release of the new Transformers: Generation 2 toyline and an accompanying comic. Grimlock's toy was re-released for the G2 toyline in several colors including blue, but he continued to appear in his original grey color scheme for most of his appearances in the G2 comic. With his transformation capabilities restored (the explanation for which was not offered in the American series), Grimlock was Optimus Prime's second in command in the so-called Generation 2 series, aiding in the Autobots' war against the \\"second generation\\" of Cybertronians led by Jhiaxus. However, he remained as rebellious and aggressive as ever, though it proved to be a mixed blessing - at one point his urge to combat Jhiaxus's forces led him and his troops right into a trap, while at another time, his willingness to defy Optimus Prime's orders and launch an all-out attack saved Prime from certain death at the hands of Megatron. When the Autobots and Decepticons united against Jhiaxus and the threat of the Swarm - a destructive by-product of Transformer reproduction - Grimlock was the joint leader of the ground troops as Prime and Megatron fought on other fronts, and survived the brutal conflict. Grimlock appeared in his blue Generation 2 form in the short lived UK. Generation 2 comic series. TFcon comics Grimlock appears in the TFcon 2008 voice play prelude comic called \\"Ground Effects\\" where Perceptor informs him about a repeat repeat wave. Grimlock orders the other Dinobots to dig up a Transformer on Dinobot Island. Grimlock appeared in the TFcon 2008 voice play \\"Primitive Recall.\\" =Games= The Classic line appeared in a simple Flash-based video game on the Hasbro web site called Transformers Battle Circuit.

When Hasbro imported the toy in 1985 for the Transformers line, the blue crotch was changed to red and the Diaclone driver mini-figure was dropped. :The original Grimlock changes from a robot into a robotic T. rex and comes with a red sword, a black double-barreled rifle, and a rocket launcher with three silver rockets. :Grimlock was later reissued in the European/Australian-exclusive Classics series (not to be confused with the 2006 Classics line). :A variety of knockoff toys of Grimlock have been produced, including those with gold chrome, large horns on the head, and those remolded to look like Mechagodzilla. :According to X-Entertainment Grimlock was the 2nd top Transformers figure of all time. * Generation 1 Decoy Grimlock (1986) :A small rubber version of Grimlock holding his rifle in robot mode given away as a bonus item with Transformers in 1986. * Generation 1 Pretender Grimlock (1989) :A small Grimlock toy which could be stored inside a human- like shell. * Generation 1 Legends Grimlock (1989) :Basically Pretender Grimlock without the shell, helmet and with only his tail gun.

Knockoffs of this toy in bright orange and red colors have been produced. * Generation 1 Action Master Grimlock (1990) :A non-transforming Action Master toy with an anti-tank cannon which turns into a long-range mortar launcher. * Generation 2 Grimlock (1993) :Based on the original Grimlock without his missile launcher. This figure was available in blue, gray or turquoise.Tomart's Action Figure Digest #7, 1992, page 9 * Beast Wars Grimlock (1997) :A recolor of the original Dinobot. Comes with sword and rotating blade. The Dinobot mold was changed slightly for this release. The chest area underneath the Velociraptor head in robot mode was made up of bone- like detailing on Dinobot. However, in the center of all this detail, Grimlock has a square section that was molded to accommodate the Maximal heat sensitive rub sticker. Slightly smaller knockoffs of this toy have been sold under the Animism Defenders toy line.Unicron.us - Grimlock :Beast Wars Grimlock (himself a recolor of Beast Wars Dinobot) was remolded in silver and orange to appear more cybernetic as Thrustor for the Japanese-exclusive Beast Wars Second line. Later, for Beast Wars Neo, the toy was remolded to become Hardhead, a blue and purple Pachycephalosaurus, and this version of the figure was redecoed in yellow, black and green and released in the Beast Machines Dinobots subline as Dinotron. After being released under the Grimlock name again in 2003, the original version of the mold returned to its roots when it was redecoed into the 10th Anniversary edition figure of Beast Wars Dinobot. * World Smallest Dinorobots Commander (2004) :An unlicensed smaller reproduction of the Generation 1 figure by JustiToys, in the style of Takara's Smallest Transformers.JustiToys.hk * Dinobots Grimlock (2003) :A Walmart exclusive redeco of Beast Wars Grimlock that came packaged with a Terrorsaur redeco named both Swoop and Terranotron. * Alternators Grimlock (2005) :Grimlock staged a comeback in 2005 as part of the Transformers: Alternators toyline, known in Japan as \\"Binaltech\\". Although the American toys offer no supporting fiction, the Binaltech series tells the story of how Grimlock was reborn in his new form. :While the Autobots on Earth were decimated by Cosmic Rust and restored in new \\"Binaltech\\" bodies through a joint partnership with human automotive corporations, Grimlock and the Dinobots were a part of the larger war raging in space. Unfortunately, Megatron struck at their primitive minds with telepathic alien lifeforms known as \\"Unleashers,\\" which drove them to attack their fellow Autobots; with no other options, the Autobots were forced to counterattack, taking the Dinobots out of commission. Grimlock regained consciousness and vowed to do anything to return to the battle, and was consequently transported to Earth. His spark was implanted into the Autobots' newest Binaltech body, which combined all the aspects of the previous bodies. Now able to transform into a Ford Mustang GT, Grimlock immediately resented his new, non-traditional body, but came to make the best of it. He remains armed with his energo-sword, and also wields a stun laser. :The figure was also redecoed in white and blue with a different head as Wheeljack. * Titanium 3-inch Grimlock (2006) :Grimlock was released as a 3 inch tall non- transforming toy in the Transformers: Titanium line. :Mightiest among the Dinobots, Grimlock masked a surprising intelligence behind simplistic speech patterns. His contempt for the weak kept him often at odds with Optimus Prime, but his hatred for all those who exploited their strength at the expense of others kept him always firmly on the side of right. Though he could bring a huge array of weapons to any fight, he preferred to close with his enemies, wielding his Energo sword in robot mode, or simply crushing his enemies' limbs with his powerful jaw as a Tyrannosaurus. * Classics Grimlock (2006) :The original Grimlock returned to his original T. rex Beast mode in the Transformers Classics line, released in December 2006. He returns as leader of the Dinobots, in a toy that is a homage to his original and pretender releases, but with a totally new mold and for the first time, a flexible articulated tail. His fiction seems more in-tune with his The War Within persona, faking his impediment to trick his enemies, as well as collecting pieces of his opponents left over after battles to add to an ever-growing collection. Classics Grimlock represents modern research regarding the T. rex, with a horizontal back and tail carried high, rather than the classic sloped back and ground-dragging tail. :Initially sold separately, Classic Jetfire and Grimlock were later packaged in a 2-pack box set. :This toy was redecoed into BotCon exclusive Overkill (2007)TFW2005.com - Overkill and Shattered Glass Grimlock (2008).TFW2005.com - Shattered Glass Grimlock :This toy was voted the 73rd top toy released in the last 10 years by Toyfare Magazine.Toyfare Magazine issue #122 * Attacktix Grimlock (2007) :Series 2 of the Transformers Attacktix figures included a Generation 1 Grimlock figure in beast mode. * Transformers 3D Battle-Card Game Grimlock (2007) :Produced by Wizards of the Coast, wave 2 of their Transformers 3D Battle-Card Game included a Grimlock card. * Titanium 6-inch War Within Grimlock (2007) :At BotCon 2006, Hasbro announced that a figure based on Grimlock from his \\"War Within\\" comic book appearance is \\"on the rollout line\\" for the 6 inch metal Cybertron Heroes lineup.

The figure is highly articulated, comparable to the other masterpiece transformers. This figure also has eyes that can be switched between red (the original toy color) and blue (the animated series color) in both robot and T. Rex modes. It makes no sounds, but does have a light-up blaster and sword. Other accessories include an attachable brain transfer device (as seen in the episode \\"Grimlock's New Brain\\", where he transferred his newly acquired intelligence to his creation, Computron), a bowtie, an apron and a cocktail tray (used by Grimlock in \\"Madman's Paradise\\" as a waiter during an alien ambassador's meeting on Cybertron). This figure is a breath of fresh air for the Masterpiece line, in the sense that the transformation is not as complicated as the other Masterpieces, which is almost similar to that of the original G1 figure. * Masterpiece MP08X King Grimlock (2009) :A Toy Hobby (Japan) exclusive that includes the crown, sword, and gun.

Transformers: Robots in Disguise The first completely different character to bear the name of Grimlock was one inhabiting the alternate universe of the 2001 Transformers toyline, Transformers: Robots in Disguise. Grimlock (originally named Build Hurricane in the original Japanese version of the series, Car Robots) was a co-leader of the Autobot Build Team, able to transform into a steam shovel. Despite his harsh appearance, Grimlock is a seasoned, upbeat warrior. He judges any situation in a composed, calm manner, and dispenses accurate advice based on his many past experiences in battle to others, particularly his leader, Wedge. He can combine with his fellow Build Team members to create Landfill, able to form either a leg or a pair of arms. =Animated series= Grimlock first appeared in episode #18 \\"Wedge's Short Fuse\\" and last appeared in episode #38 \\"The Final Battle Part 2\\". =3H Enterprises= Robots in Disguise Grimlock (in Walmart yellow repaint colors) appeared in the 2004 BotCon voice actor play. Play Synopsis: Rhinox has built a device to deflect Unicron's attempts to pull victims from other dimensions with his tractor beam. The Autobots deflect two attempts and the victims end up on a frozen planetoid instead of with Unicron. Maximals Rattrap and Silverbolt and the Predacon Waspinator are sent to help the victims, but Reptilion, Sunstorm, Ruination, and Universe Perceptor are sent to get them for Unicron. As a side effect of the device Rhinox built, a vortex opens which sucks in an Autobot shuttle from the past piloted by Bumblebee, Tracks, and Cosmos. Thrust attacks the Maximal ship, but they are saved by being transported to the Autobot shuttle. The Autobots and Maximals then go to the planet where they save the victims from the Decepticons. On the planet are two groups of Autobots. One is from the Robots in Disguise story, with Landfill (Walmart recolor), Universe Side Burn, and Universe Prowl. The other is from another parallel world with Spy Changer Optimus Prime, Ultra Magnus, Prowl, and Ironhide. They all fight off the Decepticons. The Autobot shuttle is sent back to its own time. =Toys= * Car Robots Build Hurricane (2000) :Grimlock's first toy is actually Japan's Build Hurricane, part of its Transformers: Car Robots line in 2000. * Robots in Disguise Grimlock (2001) :When Grimlock (the American equivalent) was released in 2001, mold and paint colors were slightly altered. The most noticeable differences are the lack of metallic elements used on the Build Team's American bodies, and the tampographing of Autobot insignias on each Build Team member. (Previously, only Build Boy/Wedge carried an insignia.) :Grimlock and the rest of the Build Team were redecoed for Transformers: Universe as the Constructicons, in the characters' traditional purple and green color scheme. Grimlock became Scavenger, packaged with Hightower. * Robots in Disguise Grimlock Redeco (2003) :Grimlock was later recolored in yellow by Hasbro in 2003 for a Wal*Mart store exclusive and was packaged with his team. Although packages as part of Robots in Disguise many fans consider it to be an unofficial part of the \\"Transformers: Universe\\" toyline by being released during the Universe time period. It is the last released toy of the RiD series before it was changed to Universe. This version of the Build Team appeared in the Transformers: Universe storyline presented at the BotCon 2005 voice actor play. Transformers: Energon Another alternate-universe incarnation of Grimlock entered the fray in the Transformers: Energon line. Grimlock's toy ‚Äì packaged with the similarly- redesigned Swoop ‚Äì was a modern updating of his original figure. It still transformed into a Tyrannosaurus rex, but had one major change: Grimlock and Swoop could now combine to form a larger robot named \\"Mega-Dinobot\\". The characters' joint biography clearly draws on the Generation 1 cartoon incarnation of the original characters, presenting them as Autobots who are simple in speech and thought, but who make up for it in raw strength. Decepticons have been known to flee in fear when faced with the two Dinobots, as Swoop uses his aerial abilities to confuse and distract them, while Grimlock attacks from behind and stomps them flat before they know what hit them. Though heavily armed, the duo's preferred weaponry is their teeth and talons. =Dreamwave Productions= It comes as no surprise that longtime Grimlock fan Simon Furman intended to feature the characters in Dreamwave's Energon comic book, but the company's closure prevented this. =Fun Publications= Grimlock appeared in the text story from Fun Publications called \\"Force of Habit\\". This story explained where he was during the events of the Cybertron story. Ultra Magnus was the commander of various Autobot ships sent to other planets in search for the Cyber Planet Keys. He also served as captain of the Iron Hope which was crewed by Bonecrusher, Grimlock, Ironhide, Knock Out, Overcast, Prowl, Quickstrike, RipTide, Skyblast, Smokescreen, Swoop, Wreckage, and the Sky Scorcher Mini-Con Team. Grimlock and Swoop were sent to stop an attack by Predacon on the ship. =Toys= * Energon Grimlock with Swoop (2005) Transformers Cinematic Universe Producer Tom DeSanto has stated that he had an idea on how to include the Dinobots and Constructicons in a possible sequel, although director Michael Bay has confirmed that they will not be. However, the Constructicons and their combined form, Devastator, do appear in the 2009 movie. In a USA Today online fan poll, Grimlock was one of the 10 Transformers that the fans wanted in the sequel, tied for second with 16% of the votes. Later reports revealed that Grimlock and other Dinobots would be featured in the fourth film, with images surfacing of Optimus Prime riding Grimlock into battle in Hong Kong. =Live- action films= In Transformers: Age of Extinction, Grimlock and the Dinobots are captured by Lockdown as trophies, referred to as legendary knights. After the Autobots escape with the part of the ship holding them, Optimus releases the Dinobots for backup and engages in a battle for dominance with Grimlock which Optimus wins. Submitting to Optimus, Grimlock allows Optimus to ride him into battle in Hong Kong and aids in destroying the KSI Decepticons and protecting the Seed. After Lockdown is defeated, Optimus releases Grimlock and the Dinobots to go their own way. This Grimlock is larger than previous incarnations and, like the rest of the Dinobots, he isn't referred to by name (although in The Last Knight he is named by Cade Yeager) as he cannot speak, or at least has yet to learn how. Grimlock returned in Transformers: The Last Knight. Grimlock is among the Autobots taking sanctuary at Cade Yeager's junkyard. He has taken up the personality of a dog, often eating the local police chief's car. During the TRF and Decepticon invasion of the junkyard, Grimlock attacks a fleet of TRF cars along with Slug, eating the Decepticon Dreadbot. Though he is not seen after this, Grimlock presumably joins the other Autobots in returning to Cybertron on Lockdown's ship. Mini-Grimlock, a baby Dinobot, also appears in the Last Knight, as one of the Autobots in Cade's junkyard. It gains Grimlock's fire breath, which it uses in Cade's trailer. Mini-Grimlock is seen snuggling with Izabella and around the other Autobots. =Video Games= The Sector 7 viral marketing web site featured several videos recording supposed evidence of Transformers on Earth. These featured cameos by Generation 1 Transformers, including scenes of Grimlock destroying a construction site, as well as scenes of Kickback and Laserbeak being video taped by people accidentally, and a security video showing bits of a robot looking a lot like Generation 1 Bumblebee transforming in a parking garage. Grimlock's Age of Extinction incarnation is a playable character in Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark. In the game, his controls are very identical to his counterpart in Transformers: Fall of Cybertron. Grimlock is one of the main playable characters in Transformers: Devastation, and the only one who does not transform into a motor vehicle. =Toys= * Age of Extinction Cyberverse Grimlock (2014) * Age of Extinction Chomp and Stomp Grimlock (2014) :A new transforming toy aimed at younger children.First look: Dinobots a plenty in 'Transformers' toy line * Age of Extinction Dinobot Sparker Optimus Prime and Grimlock (2014) :A non-transforming toy of Optimus Prime riding on Grimlock.

Transformers: Animated A character named Grimlock appears in Transformers: Animated, which began airing in 2007. He is similar to his animated Generation 1 incarnation in persona and form, but with his face modified with a feral look. His beast mode now looks more like how an actual Tyrannosaurus is thought to look and his roar sounds much like the T. Rexs roar from Jurassic Park. In robot mode, he wields a flaming battle sword and can breathe fire in beast mode. Grimlock is partnered with fellow Dinobots, Snarl and Swoop. He debuts in episode 6, \\"Blast From the Past\\". Grimlock acquired his name while the damaged Megatron's head was surveying the Dinobots at Prof. Isaac Sumdac's laboratory. Megatron said, \\"And without more substantial robotics for my own body, my prospects are grim, locked in this prison of a lab.\\" He is also the only one of the Dinobots to talk and the first to transform into robot mode. =Animated series= In \\"Blast From the Past\\" the Autobots visit a dinosaur-themed amusement park where animatronic dinosaurs are on display, but Bulkhead accidentally breaks them. Professor Sumdac and Megatron rebuild the animatronic dinosaurs as technological wonders named the Dinobots, who go on a rampage under the Deception's influence until the attacks powered Sari's AllSpark key affecting Bumblebee and Ratchet's Electromagnetic blast against the Dinobots by making them conscious. Finding a way to control them, Megatron told Grimlock to attack the city by telling the Dinobots they are \\"fossil feeders\\" due to the way Earth vehicles are powered and that the Autobots are even worse. The Dinobots are lured away by the Autobots, with Prowl secretly placing them at the later named Dinobot Island in hopes that they'll live in peace. However, while expressing his rage at two birds defecating on him, Grimlock accidentally transforms to robot mode and finds his new form to his liking. In a TFA short, \\"Bulkhead Plays with Grimlock\\", Bulkhead throws a tree for no reason. Then Grimlock catches it with his mouth, and brings it back to Bulkhead. Grimlock states he loves fetch and asks to play again. Apparently this is a contradiction to \\"Human Error Part 2\\" where he criticized Snarl for willing to become a pet to Scrapper. The episode \\"Survival of the Fittest\\" marks his, as well as the rest of the Dinobots, official side change when they help defeat Meltdown, Cyrus \\"The Colossus\\" Rhodes, and Meltdown's experiments. In \\"Megatron Rising\\" Pt. 1, Optimus Prime, Prowl, and Bulkhead try to get the Dinobots to help them fight the Decepticons, but they refused saying that robots are their enemies. Upon them being told that they are robots too, Grimlock and the other two Dinobots end up fighting each other. In \\"The Elite Guard\\", Optimus Prime leads Ultra Magnus and Sentinel Prime to the downed ship on Dinobot Island when they run into Grimlock and the Dinobots. Despite Optimus' warnings, Sentinel Prime charged them and got defeated. Ultra Magnus repelled them with the lightning he summoned with his hammer. In \\"A Fistful of Energon\\", Prowl and Bulkhead are sent to the island where the Dinobots are, once again, to investigate the reports of a rampage. Soon enough, Grimlock heads right towards Prowl and Bulkhead, thinking something has made him hostile, but later discovering something is wedged between his foot, and yank it out. Later, under Blackarachnia's seduction, Grimlock returns in the episode \\"Black Friday\\" to break out Meltdown. Out of the Dinobots, Grimlock had the most love for Blackarachnia, refusing to accept that she's using him when she departs, leaving him heartbroken. In \\"Predacons Rising\\" the Dinobots are once again coerced into doing Blackarachnia's bidding, bringing them into conflict with the Autobots. In the ensuing battle, they are overwhelmed and defeated by Jetfire and Jetstorm, though Jetfire noted Grimlock seemed to have some fight left in him. During the Human Error 2-parter, Sari attempted to get the Dinobots' aid only to have a not so warm welcome. Though she managed to convince him not to attack with her techno-organic powers, Grimlock refuses to give the Autobots aid; however, he indirectly led her in looking for Snarl, whom he lost respect towards and considered a 'traitor' for befriending the marooned Scrapper. =Other media= Grimlock appears among the characters in Re-Unification, the 2010 TFCon voice actor play prelude comic.TFCon =Toys= * Animated Voyager Grimlock (2008) : Grimlock transforms into a mechanical Tyrannosaurus fairly accurate to his Animated appearance. He comes with a large, transparent orange sword with flame details that spring out when the sword is placed in his right hand and the wrist is twisted clockwise or counter-clockwise. A button on his dinosaur mode neck opens his mouth. The transformation sequence is very close to his original G1 toy, but with more details and a few minor steps added. : The box packaging and instructions mention the sword also being able to connect to his mouth as a \\"Jet flame breath attack,\\" though there are no actual connection points in his mouth. This feature was probably dropped during production due to issues with getting the sword to actually fit inside his mouth. * Animated Activators Grimlock (2008) :A small version of Grimlock that transforms at the push of a button.

It should also be noted that this Grimlock has Trypticon's colors. According to the Tech Specs Grimlock was created as an experiment in artificial intelligence by the Decepticons which became too violent and Megatron shut him down. Optimus Prime then liberated Grimlock and let him work for the Autobots. Initially Grimlock is a non-living machine without the ability to transform to a humanoid shape. Once granted an ember by the Omega Terminus he gains the ability to transform. His transformation seems to be tied to his emotions. When calm intellectual he gains a humanoid mode, but when enraged he is forced into dinosaur mode. Grimlock was reprogrammed by Optimus Prime to not be able to attack anything bearing the purple Autobot symbol, but after being granted an ember he seems to have overcome this limitation. =Reception= The Botcon 2008 set was chosen as the \\"Action Figure Digest Hot Pick.\\" =Fun Publications= Grimlock appears in the 2008 April Fool's comic \\"Shattered Expectations\\" by Fun Publications. Grimlock appears as a member of Optimus Prime's forces in the Transformers: Timelines story \\"Shattered Glass\\". He helps defend the Ark from a Decepticon attack, but is overcome by the Predacons. Grimlock appears in the preview to \\"Dungeons & Dinobots\\", printed in the Transformers Collectors Club magazine issue #22. Huffer attempts to capture Grimlock, but Grimlock chases him away while following a strange voice into the depths of Cybertron. Grimlock appears in the text fiction \\"Dungeons & Dinobots\\". The mad Autobot scientist Wheeljack duplicates Grimlock's design to create an army of Dinobots, which he uses to attack the Decepticons, but sadly the dinobots attack each other in the frenzy of their first battle. Grimlock runs off, being called to the super computer known as the Omega Terminus, Grimlock is granted an ember, superior intelligence and the ability to transform. Followed by the Rodimus, Blurr, Cliffjumper and Sideswipe, he confronts the four with the aid of an army of zombie mechs, including the reanimated bodies of the dead Cliffjumper from his world and Sideswipe's old leader Drench. He bites the left hand off Rodimus during the battle, but thrown off a cliff during the fight. Although presumed dead he appears at the Autobot headquarters offering his services to Optimus Prime of his own free will, secretly planning on helping grant embers the various Dinobots and Dinocons. In \\"Do Over\\" it is revealed that Grimlock had given the Dinobots and Dinocons embers, then returned them to the Autobots and Decepticons. In Reunification Grimlock is seen gnawing on the body of Blurr, who was punished by Optimus Prime for failing to stop Rodimus from taking the Ark. =Toys= * Timelines Deluxe Grimlock (2008) :A BotCon '08 exclusive redeco of the Classics Grimlock figure in the colors of Generation 1 Trypticon. Aligned continuity There are two characters with the name Grimlock in the Aligned continuity. The first, featured in the video game, is known for not following orders or trusting in Optimus Prime's ability to be an effective leader. This Grimlock is evidently based on the original Generation 1 character. Gregg Berger reprises his role as Grimlock for the first time in 25 years since the 1984 cartoon series. This incarnation is evidently more intelligent than his Generation 1 counterpart, and initially speaks in a more coherent manner as with other characters. As the leader of the Lightning Strike Coalition Force, Grimlock enjoys smashing things first and asking questions later. Due to Shockwave's experiments, Grimlock has been left with a malfunctioning voice processor and alt-mode inspired by a distant primitive world. The second Grimlock is part of Bumblebee's new team of Autobots in Transformers: Robots in Disguise, and is a more light hearted version of the character with a love of smashing but a fear of kittens. Some major changes from previous Grimlock incarnations is that along with not having a speech impediment that was shown in series prior, he also has a much more mild manner and a showingly kind personality with an artistic side, frequently doing art projects and sculptures as the series progresses. Despite this, he usually is shown as not the most intellectual character on the team. Coincidentally, this incarnation also sports green colors similar to the 2001's incarnation from the series also titled Transformers: Robots in Disguise. =Comics= The first Grimlock appears in the Transformers: Prime spinoff comic series, Rage of the Dinobots, in which he and the other Dinobots remain behind on Cybertron after Optimus Prime departs. Grimlock becomes the leader of a city known as Last Spark, ruling over and protecting the citizens in a monarchial fashion. He and the other Dinobots are forced to contend with the prejudices of other Cybertronians due to their altered states, as well as Shockwave's creations, which include a group of Decepticons known as the Forged. =Games= Grimlock appears as a minor character in the portable version of Transformers: War for Cybertron, and one of the main characters of subject in the 2012 game Transformers: Fall of Cybertron, where he and his team are captured by Shockwave and the Insecticons and taken to a laboratory where Shockwave transforms them into the Dinobots. Grimlock becomes the first to break free following a brief encounter with the disgraced Starscream and proceeds to free three of four (Sludge having been put in stasis lock and left behind after they were captured) other members of his team, discover his Dinobot abilities, and destroy the space bridge Megatron plans to use as a route to a perpetual energy source, Earth. Toys * Generations Voyager Grimlock (2013) =Animated Series= In Transformers: Robots in Disguise, as one of many Decepticon prisoners aboard the Autobot ship Alchemor, Grimlock was the only one not to escape when the vessel crashed on Earth. The stasis unit on his cell was damaged however, and he was thus awake when the Autobots were engaging his former fellow inmate Underbite in the first pilot episode. He was freed after he insulted Underbite, and subsequently engaged the Decepticon in battle to satisfy his destructive impulses. Grimlock then proved an unlikely addition to Bumblebee's team, and with them witnessed the astonishing reappearance of Optimus Prime. After Underbite was imprisoned, Bumblebee decided to allow Grimlock to join the team on probation, and thus has been a major character in the series since. Later, after bringing the cyber-tick Minitron, he was formally inducted into the Autobot ranks and began to sport Autobot symbols instead of the Decepticon ones he sported in all of the episodes prior. According to Bumblebee, the only reason Grimlock was imprisoned on the Alchemor was due to severe property damage, which Bumblebee deemed to just be him acting like himself and not being a threat. Transformers: Cyberverse Grimlock is one of the characters who appeared in Transformers: Cyberverse, and unlike past versions of the character, is shown to be charismatic and civilized, only when in his Dino mode does he show impediments in speech (akin to Bruce Banner / The Incredible Hulk). This version also has missile launchers in his robot mode shoulders, and a seismic stomp attack more often paired with Dinobot Sludge.

History  For the ancient Asuka, see Asuka period and Asuka, Yamato. In 1956, the village of Asuka (ÊòéÊó•È¶ô) was founded as a result of a merger of three villages, Sakaai, Takechi and Asuka (È£õÈ≥•Êùë). In 1966, Asuka was proclaimed a \\"historic town\\", as defined by the national Special Arrangement for Preservation of Historic Sites Law as well as Kyoto, Nara and Kamakura. The law restricts constructions and other civil engineering operations in the designated areas due preservation of the historic sites. In 1967, a part of Asuka, around 391ha in area, was designated as a historic site for preservation. Along with this decision, the government planned to build Asuka National Historic Park, for which construction was launched in 1966 and finished in 1994. In 1972, a site with colorfully painted murals from the late Asuka period was found in the Takamatsuzuka Tomb. Since the Special Arrangement for Preservation of Historic Sites Law (1966) restricts any visual changes in the areas which it concerns, it has directly affected the daily life of residents. To preserve the site, they have had to give up some elements of modern life. As compensation, the Asuka Law, which aims to preserve the site effectively and give economic support for Asuka residents, was settled in 1980.  Asuka stones and Kofun  In various parts of the Asuka region are unusual carved granite stones the largest of which is Masuda no iwafune. This is a large stone structure approximately 11 meters in length, 8 meters in width, and 4.7 meters In height. The upper surface is flat, with a shallow trough and two square holes. This is located on top of a hill just a few hundred meters west of Okadera Station. How or why this colossal stone and others was carved remains a mystery. They appear to be a different style than later Buddhist sculptures.http://www2.gol.com/users/stever/asukas.htmhttp://www.megalithic.co.uk/search.php?query=&topic;=&author;=&sitetype;=44&county;=602&category;=&type;=stories There are also several nearby kofuns or tombs including the Ishibutai Kofun which is built from massive boulders including one that weighs an estimated 75 tons.

These flowering cherry trees were planted in four groves at different altitudes, in part so that the trees would be visible coming into bloom at different times in the spring. An account of Yoshino written in about 1714 explained that, on their climb to the top, travelers would be able to enjoy the lower 1,000 cherry trees at the base, the middle 1,000 on the way, the upper 1,000 toward the top, and the 1,000 in the precincts of the inner shrine at the top.

Before supermarkets and other modern conveniences existed, the townspeople gathered every ten days for a market. Hatsuichi marked the first market of the new lunar year. Over time Hatsuichi and the local Ebisu Shrine joined in creating the modern festival. Ebisu is a god of business and one of the seven \\"lucky gods\\" derived from China. The Ebisu Shrine is decorated with lanterns, traditional ornaments and colors for the festival, which now marks the annual opening of the shrine. On the afternoon of Hatsuichi a portable shrine is paraded through the town. In July, the neighboring town of Oyodo hosts the Yoshino-gawa festival, which includes a fireworks display. In early October, the town holds a sports festival in honor of Japan's national Health and Sports Day. An opening ceremony including fireworks and the lighting of an Olympic-style torch takes place as neighborhoods compete in various games. Prizes are awarded on the neighborhood and town level, and may include items such as bags of rice, bicycles, toaster ovens, heaters, tissues, beer, game systems, and various household items. The town's schools also participate in the event with various dances and performances. The Aki Matsuri (Fall or Autumn Festival) is held in mid- to late October. Activities include a parade of lanterns and drums down the main street to one of the town's temples near the top of a mountain. The town's bunkasai (cultural festival) also takes place around this time, with numerous performances by townspeople and local school children, as well as displays of calligraphy, pottery, paintings, and flower arrangements by local artists in the town's cultural hall.

He is well known for singing soul ballads (often as a duet with female singers) and has contributed to two Disney animated feature soundtracks. Bryson is a winner of two Grammy Awards. Early years and career He had two sisters and a brother and spent much of his childhood on his grandfather's farm in Mauldin, South Carolina. His love for music stemmed from his mother, who often took the family to concerts of well-known African-American artists at the time. Bryson marked his professional debut at age 14, singing backup for Al Freeman and the Upsetters, a local Greenville group. It was Freeman's difficulty in pronouncing Bryson's French West-Indian name, \\"Peapo\\", that led Bryson to change its spelling to Peabo. Two years later, he left home to tour the Chitlin' Circuit with another local band, Moses Dillard and the Tex-Town Display. Bryson's first break came during a recording session at Atlanta's Bang Records. Although Bang was not impressed with Dillard's band, the young backup singer caught the ear of the label's general manager, Eddie Biscoe. Biscoe signed Bryson to a contract as a writer, producer, and arranger and encouraged Bryson to perform his own songs. For several years, Bryson worked with hometown bands and wrote and produced for Bang. In 1976, he launched his own recording career with \\"Underground Music\\" on the Bang label. His first album, Peabo, followed shortly thereafter. Although only a regional success, Bryson signed to Capitol Records in 1977. Bryson's greatest solo hits include 1977's \\"Feel the Fire\\" and \\"Reaching for the Sky\\", 1978's \\"I'm So into You\\" and \\"Crosswinds\\", 1982's \\"Let the Feeling Flow\\", 1984's \\"If Ever You're in My Arms Again\\" (his first Top 10 pop single, at No. 10 in the US), 1989's \\"Show and Tell\\", and the 1991 hit \\"Can You Stop the Rain\\". In 1985, he appeared on the soap opera One Life to Live to sing a lyrical version of its theme song. Bryson's vocals were added to the regular theme song in 1987 and his voice was heard daily until 1992. He recorded the successful album of romantic love duets with Roberta Flack (Born to Love) in 1983. In partnership with Regina Belle, Bryson recorded two hit duets: \\"Without You\\", the love theme from the comedy film Leonard Part 6, recorded in 1987 and \\"A Whole New World\\", the main theme of the Disney's animated feature film Aladdin, recorded in 1992. Bryson and Belle recorded four duets over the years: \\"Without You\\" (in 1987), \\"I Can't Imagine\\" (in 1991), \\"A Whole New World\\" (in 1992) and \\"Total Praise\\" (in 2009).

In Spring 1998, Bryson contributed his voice to Barney's Great Adventure: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, with the song \\"Dream (Twinken's Tune)\\". Bryson performed in theater and operatic productions, most notably the tenor role of \\"Sportin' Life\\" in the Michigan Opera Theater of Detroit's version of Porgy and Bess. His tax problems caught up with him on August 21, 2003, when the U.S. Internal Revenue Service seized property from his Atlanta, Georgia, home. He is reported to owe $1.2 million in taxes dating back to 1984. The IRS auctioned many of his possessions, including both Grammy Awards, electronic equipment, his grand piano and multiple pairs of shoes. In 2002, Bryson's \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" music video was included on the platinum and Blu-ray edition of Beauty and the Beast. His \\"A Whole New World\\" music video was included on the platinum edition DVD release of Aladdin. Bryson's CD, Missing You, was released on October 2, 2007 on Peak Records, a division of Concord Music Group. September 4, 2016 was declared \\"Peabo Bryson Day\\" in Charleston, SC and North Charleston, SC during the LowCountryJazzFest. The annual jazzfest is presented by ClosingTheGapInHealthCare.org, founded by Dr. Thaddeus Bell. In 2018, Bryson released his new album Stand For Love, which was produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. The project was released on Jam & Lewis' newly reactivated label, Perspective Records.

Species Plantarum 2: 987 in Latin Description Cockleburs are coarse, herbaceous annual plants growing to tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, with deeply toothed margins. Some species, notably Xanthium spinosum, are also very thorny with long, slender spines at the leaf bases.Flora of North America Vol. 21 Page 19, Lampourde, Xanthium Linnaeus, Sp. Pl. 2: 987. 1753; Gen. Pl. ed. 5, 424. 1754. The flower heads are of two types; One, in short terminal branches, produces only pollen. The other, in clusters in the axils of the leaves, produces seed. Unlike many other members of the family Asteraceae, whose seeds are airborne with a plume of silky hairs resembling miniature parachutes, cocklebur seeds are produced in a hard, spiny, globose or oval double-chambered, single-seeded bur long. It is covered with stiff, hooked spines, which stick to fur and clothing and can be quite difficult to detach. These burs are carried long distances from the parent plant during seed dispersal by help of animals (zoochorous).Flora of China Vol. 20‚Äì21 Page 4, 6, 852, 875 ËãçËÄ≥Â±û cang er shu Xanthium Linnaeus, Sp. Pl. 2: 987. 1753. Biology Cockleburs are short-day plants, meaning they only initiate flowering when the days are getting shorter in the late summer and fall, typically from July to October in the Northern Hemisphere. They can also flower in the tropics where the daylength is constant. Diversity Over 200 names have been proposed for species, subspecies, and varieties within the genus. Most of these are regarded as synonyms of highly variable species. Some recognize as few as two or three species in the genus.

Toxicity and uses The common cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium) is a native of North America. It has become an invasive species worldwide. It invades agricultural lands and can be poisonous to livestock, including horses, cattle, and sheep. Some domestic animals will avoid consuming the plant if other forage is present, but less discriminating animals, such as pigs, will consume the plants and then sicken and die. The seedlings and seeds are the most toxic parts of the plants. Symptoms usually occur within a few hours, producing unsteadiness and weakness, depression, nausea and vomiting, twisting of the neck muscles, rapid and weak pulse, difficulty breathing, and eventually death. The plant also has been used for making yellow dye, hence the name of the genus (Greek xanthos = 'yellow'). The many species of this plant, which can be found in many areas, may actually be varieties of two or three species. The seed oil is edible. Xanthium strumarium is known as cang er zi (ËãçËÄ≥Â≠ê) in traditional Chinese medicine. Xanthium is also used to treat nasal and sinus congestion. The spines and seeds of this fruit are rich in a chemical called carboxyatractyloside (CAT), formerly referred to as xanthostrumarin, which is the chemical that is responsible for most of the adverse effects from the use of cang er zi. CAT has been shown to be a growth inhibitor in Xanthium and other plants, serving two functions, delaying seed germination and inhibiting the growth of other plants. Most of the chemical is concentrated in the spines. When the bur is prepared as an herbal remedy, the spines are usually removed, reducing the CAT content of the finished product.Cutler, H. G. and R. J. Cole. (1983). Carboxyatractyloside: A compound from Xanthium strumarium and Atractylis gummifera with plant growth inhibiting properties. Journal of Natural Products 46(5) 609-13. Velcro The Cocklebur was the inspiration for a Swiss Engineer named George de Mestral. He had gotten the idea for velcro from when he was hiking in the Swiss mountains in 1948 and some Cocklebur had gotten stuck onto his pants and onto his dog's fur. He then wondered how the Cocklebur stuck on and that is how Velcro was invented.

It was the first movie location built in Texas, originally constructed for and best known as the setting for The Alamo (1960), directed by John Wayne and starring Wayne, Richard Widmark, Laurence Harvey and Frankie Avalon. History The set was built by James T. \\"Happy\\" Shahan of Brackettville, who in 1995 was named the \\"Father of the Texas movie industry\\" by Governor George W. Bush. Shahan began building the set on his ranch in September, 1957 for Wayne, who had tried for years to make a movie about the Battle of the Alamo for Republic Pictures, before finally breaking away to form Batjac Productions. Filming began in August, 1959. Originally the set was to be facades of the front and sides of the buildings. However, Wayne ran out of money and called a halt to construction. Shahan agreed to continue working while Wayne raised more money, if Wayne would agree to building full sets with four walls, floor and roofs. Wayne signed on to the deal. The set includes a full-scale re-creation of the Alamo compound as it would have appeared in 1836 (the real Alamo is in the middle of what is now Downtown San Antonio and is surrounded by modern skyscrapers). The set also includes a representation of the village of San Antonio de B√©xar of the same time period. The building of the set required over 1.5 million adobe bricks (which were manufactured on site), 14 miles of gravel road and a 4,000-foot runway. The full scale set for The Alamo. Shahan preserved the set after the end of the 1960 production and, over the years, over a dozen films about the Alamo have been shot there. In addition, over 100 other western movies as well as documentaries, music videos and commercials have been shot using various parts of the set. Frank Thompson, a film historian, noted that each production changed the set in some way, big or small, and that the changes appear in each new movie about the Alamo, documenting the current view of authenticity over time. The 2004 Disney movie about the Alamo was not shot on this set, but in a new set built in Dripping Springs, Texas. After the filming of the 1960 version of The Alamo, the village has served primarily as a tourist attraction. For several decades, it served as a significant local employer and element of the economy of Brackettville. In addition to the replica of The Alamo, the village included a cantina and restaurant, a trading post, an Indian store, a church, a jail, a blacksmith shop, the John Wayne Western Museum, several museums, and a celebrity gallery. Alamo Village also maintained a collection of antique tools, vehicles and other period props, as well as a herd of longhorn cattle. During the summer, live music and stage shows performed frequently, and over Labor Day weekend the Labor Day Horse Races brought crowds to the village. Alamo Village was open to visitors year round except for December 21‚Äì26. In 2004, the set was put up for sale by its owner, Virginia Shahan, Happy Shahan's widow, for $3.0 million. Virginia Shahan died on June 23, 2009 at the age of 93. Alamo Village was closed to the public while her estate evaluated the feasibility of the Village's continued operation in the midst of the late-2000s recession. Alamo Village temporarily re-opened after the death of owner Virginia Shahan but on September 28, 2009, Tulisha Shahan Wardlaw, Happy and Virginia's daughter died at the age of 67. Alamo Village then closed its doors and removed its website, ending an era.Bracketville, Texas: Alamo Village (Closed) Alamo Village reopened briefly for the summer in 2010 with limited hours and no shows, stores or restaurants, but closed again within a few months. Corpus Christi, Texas business man David Jones was in the process of raising funds to buy the site. After an eight year closure, the site opened for a short time in late January 2018, possibly for the last time. The event was a liquidation sale of all of the props.Wagons, movie set props up for sale at Alamo Village A news item at the time indicated that the future of the site was undecided.‚ÄòIt Couldn‚Äôt Last Forever:‚Äô Alamo Village Owners Put Props Up for Sale Selected filmography *The Alamo (1960) - Produced, directed and starring John Wayne *Two Rode Together (1961) - starring James Stewart *Bandolero!

He is described by early writers such as Bede, Alcuin and Stephen of Ripon as a man of great learning. Some of his works and some letters written to him survive. His reign was relatively peaceful, marred only by disputes with Bishop Wilfrid, a major figure in the early Northumbrian church. Aldfrith was born on an uncertain date to Oswiu of Northumbria and an Irish princess named F√≠n. Oswiu later became King of Northumbria; he died in 670 and was succeeded by his son Ecgfrith. Aldfrith was educated for a career in the church and became a scholar. However, in 685, when Ecgfrith was killed at the battle of Nechtansmere, Aldfrith was recalled to Northumbria, reportedly from the Hebridean island of Iona, and became king. In his early-8th-century account of Aldfrith's reign, Bede states that he \\"ably restored the shattered fortunes of the kingdom, though within smaller boundaries\\".Bede, Ecclesiastical History, Book IV, Chapter 26. His reign saw the creation of works of Hiberno-Saxon art such as the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Codex Amiatinus, and is often seen as the start of Northumbria's golden age. Background and accession By the year 600, most of what is now England had been conquered by invaders from the continent, including Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. Bernicia and Deira, the two Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in the north of England, were first united under a single ruler in about 605 when √Üthelfrith, king of Bernicia, extended his rule over Deira. Over the course of the 7th century, the two kingdoms were sometimes ruled by a single king, and sometimes separately. The combined kingdom became known as the kingdom of Northumbria: it stretched from the River Humber in the south to the River Forth in the north.Hunter Blair, An Introduction, pp. 42‚Äì45. Ireland in the time of Aldfrith In 616, √Üthelfrith was succeeded by Edwin of Northumbria, a Deiran. Edwin banished √Üthelfrith's sons, including both Oswald and Oswiu of Northumbria. Both spent their exile in D√°l Riata, a kingdom spanning parts of northeastern Ireland and western Scotland. Oswiu was a child when he came to D√°l Riata, and grew up in an Irish milieu.Philip Holdsworth, \\"Oswiu\\", in Lapidge et al., Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England, p. 349. He became a fluent speaker of Old Irish,Bede, Ecclesiastical History, Book III, Chapter 25. and may have married a princess of the U√≠ N√©ill dynasty, probably F√≠n the daughter (or possibly granddaughter) of Colm√°n R√≠mid.Kirby, Earliest English Kings, p. 143. Aldfrith was a child of this marriage, but his date of birth is unrecorded.Grimmer, ¬ß25; Kirby, p. 143.; Williams, p. 18. He was probably thus a cousin or nephew of the noted scholar Cenn F√°elad mac Aillila, and perhaps a nephew of Bishop Finan of Lindisfarne.Colm√°n R√≠mid mac B√°et√°in died circa 604, and is listed as a High King of Ireland, see Charles- Edwards, pp. 502 & 504; for F√≠n as granddaughter of Colm√°n R√≠mid see Kirby, p. 143 and Cramp; for the possible relationship with Bishop F√≠nan, see Campbell, p. 86. Irish law made F√≠n's kin, the Cen√©l nE√≥gain of the northern U√≠ N√©ill, responsible for his upbringing.Grimmer, ¬ß23. The relationship between Aldfrith's father and mother was not considered a lawful marriage by Northumbrian churchmen of his day, and he is described as the son of a concubine in early sources.The term used is nothus, bastard. Some later sources doubt his paternity, but well-informed contemporary ones, including those derived from the Chronicle of Ireland are in no doubt that he was Oswiu's son, for example, the notice of his death in the Annals of Ulster, s.a. 704, which calls him \\"Aldfrith m. Ossu\\". See also Yorke, Conversion, pp. 226‚Äì227. Oswald and Oswiu returned to Northumbria after Edwin's death in 633, and between them they ruled for much of the middle of the 7th century. The 8th-century monk and chronicler Bede lists both Oswald and Oswiu as having held imperium, or overlordship, over the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms; in Oswiu's case his dominance extended beyond the Anglo-Saxons to the Picts, the Gaels of D√°l Riata, and the many obscure and nameless native British kingdoms in what are now North West England and southern Scotland.Holdsworth; Kirby, pp 95‚Äì98. Oswiu's overlordship was ended in 658 by the rise of Wulfhere of Mercia, but his reign continued until his death in 670, when Ecgfrith, one of his sons by his second wife, Eanfl√¶d, succeeded him. Ecgfrith was unable to recover Oswiu's position in Mercia and the southern kingdoms, and was defeated by Wulfhere's brother √Üthelred in a battle on the River Trent in 679.Fraser, pp. 119‚Äì120, and Kirby, pp. 84‚Äì85, suggest that the defeat at the Trent was a greater blow to Northumbrian pretensions to the overlordship of Britain than the defeat at Nechtansmere in 685. Ecgfrith sent an army under his general, Berht, to Ireland in 684 where he ravaged the plain of Brega, destroying churches and taking hostages. The raid may have been intended to discourage support for any claim Aldfrith might have to the throne, though other motives are possible.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p. 85, makes this suggestion. Charles- Edwards, chapter 10, and especially pp. 429‚Äì438, suggests that ecclesiastical politics may have been of great importance. See also Fraser, pp. 43‚Äì47. The descent of Aldfrith. Kings in italics reigned over Northumbria, Bernicia or Deira. Date ranges are given for reigns.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p. 76. Ecgfrith's two marriages‚Äîthe first to the saintly virgin √Üthelthryth (Saint Audrey), the second to Eormenburh‚Äîproduced no children.Alan Thacker, \\"Ecgfrith\\", ODNB; Cramp, \\"Aldfrith\\", ODNB. He had two full brothers: Alhfrith, who is not mentioned after 664, and √Ülfwine, who was killed at the battle on the Trent in 679.Kirby, Earliest English Kings, pp. 96, 103. Hence the succession in Northumbria was unclear for some years before Ecgfrith's death. Bede's Life of Cuthbert recounts a conversation between Cuthbert and Abbess √Ülffl√¶d of Whitby, daughter of Oswiu, in which Cuthbert foresaw Ecgfrith's death. When √Ülffl√¶d asked about his successor, she was told she would love him as a brother: > \\"But,\\" said she, \\"I beseech you to tell me where he may be found.\\" He > answered, \\"You behold this great and spacious sea, how it aboundeth in > islands. It is easy for God out of some of these to provide a person to > reign over England.\\" She therefore understood him to speak of [Aldfrith], > who was said to be the son of her father, and was then, on account of his > love of literature, exiled to the Scottish islands.Bede, Life of Cuthbert, > chapter XXIV. D.P. Kirby suggests that \\"[r]ather than asking Cuthbert > ingenuously who would succeed Ecgfrith, [√Ülffl√¶d] was probably testing his > loyalties\\"; Kirby, p. 106. The anonymous Life of Cuthbert, written during > Aldfrith's reign, is generally similar in its account, but differs in the > last sentence, which reads \\"Then she quickly remembered that he spoke of > Aldfrith who now reigns in peace, who was then on the island they call > [Iona]\\"; Fraser, pp. 138‚Äì139. Cuthbert, later considered a saint, was a second cousin of Aldfrith (according to Irish genealogies), which may have been the reason for his proposal as monarch.'Was St.Cuthbert an Irishman' . Aldfrith of Northumbria and the Irish genealogies. Ireland, C. A., in Celtica 22 (1991)]. Ecgfrith was killed during a campaign against his cousin, the King of the Picts Bridei map Beli, at a battle known as Nechtansmere to the Northumbrians, in Pictish territory north of the Firth of Forth.Dunnichen in Angus has, until recently, been the preferred site; see e.g. Kirby, Earliest English Kings, p. 99\\\\. An alternative site at Dunachton in Badenoch has been proposed by Woolf, Dun Nechtain, Fortriu and the Geography of the Picts Bede recounts that Queen Eormenburh and Cuthbert were visiting Carlisle that day, and that Cuthbert had a premonition of the defeat.Bede, Life of Cuthbert, chapter XXVII. Ecgfrith's death threatened to break the hold of the descendants of √Üthelfrith on Northumbria, but the scholar Aldfrith became king and the thrones of Bernicia and Deira remained united.Kirby, p. 106, notes \\"Aelfflaed's question to Cuthbert reveals the ambition of this family, which had possessed royal power continuously since 633 or 634, to hold on to it\\". The succession at Aldfrith's death was disputed, and a distant branches of his own as well as other families contested successfully for power after the death of Aldfrith's son Osred. Although rival claimants of royal descent must have existed, there is no recorded resistance to Aldfrith's accession.D.P. Kirby notes \\"[t]he prestige of Oswiu's family, or else its capacity for intimidation, must have been very considerable for Aldfrith to return and rule in what seems to have been domestic peace\\"; Kirby, p. 144. It has also been suggested that Aldfrith's ascent was eased by support from D√°l Riata, the U√≠ N√©ill, and the Picts, all of whom might have preferred the mature, known quantity of Aldfrith to an unknown and more warlike monarch, such as Ecgfrith or Oswiu had been.Kirby, p. 144. Cramp suggests that Aldfrith may already have been present in Northumbria at Ecgfrith's death; Blair, Northumbria, p. 52, prefers Iona. The historian Herman Moisl, for example, wrote that \\"Aldfrith was in Iona in the year preceding the battle [of Nechtansmere]; immediately afterwards, he was king of Northumbria. It is quite obvious that he must have been installed by the Pictish-D√°l Riatan alliance\\".Moisl, \\"Bernician Royal Dynasty\\", p. 121. Subsequently, a battle between the Northumbrians and the Picts in which Berht was killed is recorded by Bede and the Irish annals in 697 or 698.Kirby, p. 142; Annals of Ulster, s.a. 697; Bede, Ecclesiastical History, Book V, Chapter 24. Overall, Aldfrith appears to have abandoned his predecessors' attempts to dominate Northumbria's neighbours.Cramp, \\"Aldfrith\\", ODNB. Aldfrith's Northumbria The British Isles in the late seventh century Bede, paraphrasing Virgil, wrote that following Ecgfrith's death, \\"the hopes and strengths of the English realm began 'to waver and slip backward ever lower'\\". The Northumbrians never regained the dominance of central Britain lost in 679, or of northern Britain lost in 685. Nonetheless, Northumbria remained one of the most powerful states of Britain and Ireland well into the Viking Age.Campbell, pp. 88ff; Kirby, pp. 142‚Äì143. Aldfrith ruled both Bernicia and Deira throughout his reign, but the two parts remained distinct, and would again be divided by the Vikings in the late 9th century.Holdsworth, \\"Northumbria\\". The centre of Bernicia lay in the region around the later Anglo-Scottish border, with Lindisfarne, Hexham, Bamburgh, and Yeavering being important religious and royal centres. Even after Ecgfrith's death, Bernicia included much of modern southeast Scotland, with a presumed royal centre at Dunbar, and religious centres at Coldingham and Melrose.Alcock, Kings and Warriors, pp. 214‚Äì7, for discussion of Dunbar as a Bernician royal centre. The details of the early Middle Ages in northwest England and southwest Scotland are more obscure, but a Bishop of Whithorn is known from shortly after Aldfrith's reign. York, Catterick, Ripon, and Whitby appear to have been important sites in Deira.Blair, Introduction, pp 37‚Äì49, p. 42, map 7, & p. 145, map 9; Higham, cc. 4‚Äì5, passim. Northumbria's southern frontier with Mercia ran across England, from the Humber in the east, following the River Ouse and the River Don, to the Mersey in the west. Some archaeological evidence, the Roman Rig dyke, near modern Sheffield, appears to show that it was a defended border, with large earthworks set back from the frontier.Higham, pp. 140‚Äì144. The Nico Ditch, to the south of modern Manchester, has been cited in this context, though it has also been argued that it was simply a boundary marker without fortifications.Nevell, Lands and Lordships, p. 41. In the far north, the evidence is less clear, and it appears that authority lay with sub-kings, perhaps including native British rulers. The family of Ecgfrith's general Berht may have been one such dynasty of under-kings.Kirby, p. 100; Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, pp. 92 & 171. Relations with the Church Bishoprics (underlined), monasteries (italicised) and other locations in the north central British Isles in the time of Aldfrith Along with the king, royal family, and chief noblemen, the church was a major force in Northumbria. Churchmen were not only figures of spiritual authority, they were major landowners, who also controlled trade, centred at major churches and monasteries in a land without cities and towns. The bishopric of Lindisfarne was held by Cuthbert at Aldfrith's accession; Cuthbert was succeeded by the Irish-educated Eadberht, who would later be Abbot of Iona and bring the Easter controversy to an end, and then by Eadfrith, creator of the Lindisfarne Gospels. The bishops of Lindisfarne sometimes held the see of Hexham, but during Aldfrith's reign it was held by John of Beverley, a pupil and prot√©g√© of Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The bishopric of York was held by Bosa in 685. Wilfrid was given the see in 687, but removed in 691 with Bosa returning to York. The short-lived see at Abercorn, created in 681 for Bishop Trumwine, collapsed in the period after Ecgfrith's death and the first known Bishop of Whithorn was appointed in the reign of King Ceolwulf. Important monasteries existed at Whitby, where the known abbesses tended to be members of the Deiran royal family, at Monkwearmouth-Jarrow, where Bede was a monk, and at Ripon.Blair, Introduction, pp. 132‚Äì141. Aldfrith appears to have had the support of leading ecclesiastics, most notably his half-sister √Ülffl√¶d and the highly respected Bishop Cuthbert.Yorke, Conversion, pp 226‚Äì227. He is known to have received confirmation at the hands of Aldhelm, later the Bishop of Sherborne in the south-western Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Wessex. Aldhelm too had received an Irish education, but in Britain, at Malmesbury. Correspondence between the two survives, and Aldhelm sent Aldfrith his treatise on the numerology of the number seven, the Epistola ad Acircium.Lapidge, \\"Aldfrith\\"; Lapidge, \\"Aldhelm\\"; Blair, Northumbria, p. 53; Mayr-Harting, p. 195. Aldfrith also owned a manuscript on cosmography, which (according to Bede) he purchased from Abbot Ceolfrith of Monkwearmouth-Jarrow in exchange for an estate valued at eight hides.Blair, World of Bede, pp. 184‚Äì185; Bede, Life of the Abbots of Wearmouth and Jarrow, c. 15. Aldfrith was a close friend of Adomn√°n, Abbot of Iona from 679, and may have studied with him.Grimmer, ¬ß25, note 60. In the 680s Aldfrith twice met with Adomn√°n, who came to seek the release of the Irish captives taken in Berht's expedition of 684. These were released and Adomn√°n presented Aldfrith with a copy of his treatise De Locis Sanctis (\\"On the Holy Places\\"), a description of the places of pilgrimage in the Holy Land, and at Alexandria and Constantinople. Bede reports that Aldfrith circulated Adomn√°n's work for others to read.Blair, World of Bede, pp. 185‚Äì186; Yorke, Conversion, pp. 17‚Äì18; Bede, Ecclesiastical History, Book V, Chapters 15‚Äì17. Bede described Aldfrith as a scholar, and his interest in learning distinguishes him from the earlier Anglo-Saxon warrior kings, such as Penda. Irish sources describe him as a sapiens, a term from the Latin for wise that refers to a scholar not usually associated with a particular church. It implies a degree of learning and wisdom that led historian Peter Hunter Blair to compare Aldfrith to the Platonic ideal of the philosopher king.The use of the term sapiens is discussed by Charles-Edwards, pp. 264‚Äì271. Blair, Northumbria, p. 53‚Äì54, writes of Aldfrith as \\"a man perhaps not so very far removed from the Platonic ideal of the Philosopher king\\" and as \\"one of Northumbria's first and greatest scholars\\". Bede also makes it clear that the church in Aldfrith's day was less subject to lay control of monasteries, a practice he dated from the time of Aldfrith's death.Bede, \\"Letter to Egbert\\", in Sherley-Price, Bede, p. 346. Aldfrith's relations with the Church were, however, not always smooth. He inherited from Ecgfrith a troubled relationship with Wilfrid, a major ecclesiastical figure of the time. Wilfrid, the bishop of York, had been exiled by Ecgfrith for his role in persuading Ecgfrith's wife, √Üthelthryth, to remain a saintly celibate. In 686, at the urging of Archbishop Theodore, Aldfrith allowed Wilfrid to return.Bede, Ecclesiastical History, Book V, Chapter 19.Life of Wilfrid, Chapters 43‚Äì44. Aldfrith's relations with Wilfrid were stormy; the hostility between the two was partly caused by Aldfrith's allegiances with the Celtic Church, a consequence of his upbringing in exile.Blair, Introduction, p. 137. A more significant cause of strife was Wilfrid's opposition to Theodore's division, in 677, of his huge Northumbrian diocese. When Wilfrid returned from exile the reconciliation with Aldfrith did not include Aldfrith's support for Wilfrid's attempts to recover his episcopal authority over the whole of the north.Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p. 143. By 691 or 692 their differences were beyond repair. Wilfrid's hagiographer writes:Stephen of Ripon, Life of Wilfrid, Chapter 45. > For a while all would be peace between the wise King Aldfrith and our holy > bishop, and a happier state of affairs could hardly be imagined. Then spite > would boil up again and the situation would be reversed. And so they > continued for years, in and out of friendship with each other, till finally > their quarrels came to a head and the king banished Wilfrid from > Northumbria. Wilfrid spent his exile in Mercia, where he enjoyed the staunch support of King √Üthelred. In 702 or 703, Aldfrith convened a council at Austerfield, on the southern border of Northumbria, which was attended by Berhtwald, Archbishop of Canterbury, and many bishops. The question of Wilfrid's return to Northumbria was hotly debated and then rejected by the bishops. According to Stephen of Ripon, King Aldfrith offered to use his army to pressure Wilfrid into accepting the decision, but the bishops reminded him that he had promised Wilfrid safe-conduct.Stephen of Ripon, Life of Wilfrid, Chapters 46‚Äì48. After returning to Mercia, Wilfrid was excommunicated by his enemies among the bishops. He responded by journeying to Rome, where he appealed in person to Pope John VI. The Pope provided him with letters to Aldfrith ordering that Wilfrid be restored to his offices.Stephen of Ripon, Life of Wilfrid, Chapters 49‚Äì55. Aldfrith refused to receive the letters, and Wilfrid remained in disfavour.Life of Wilfrid, Chapters 58‚Äì59; Bede, Ecclesiastical History, Book V, Chapter 19. Northumbria's Golden Age Ezra in the Codex Amiatinus, an illuminated manuscript bible created at Wearmouth-Jarrow in the reign of Aldfrith Aldfrith's reign is considered the beginning of Northumbria's Golden Age, which lasted until the end of the 8th century. The period saw the flowering of Insular art in Northumbria and produced the Lindisfarne Gospels, perhaps begun in Aldfrith's time, the scholarship of Bede, and the beginnings of the Anglo-Saxon missions to the continent.Art and scholarship, see Higham, pp. 155‚Äì166; Blair, Introduction, pp. 311‚Äì329; missions, see Blair, Introduction, pp. 162‚Äì164. The Lindisfarne Gospels are believed to be the work of Eadfrith of Lindisfarne, bishop of Lindisfarne from 698. They are not the only surviving Northumbrian illuminated manuscripts from Aldfrith's time. Also active at Lindisfarne in the late 7th century was the scribe known as the \\"Durham-Echternach calligrapher\\", who produced the Durham Gospels and the Echternach Gospels.The Northumbrian origins of the Echternach Gospels have been debated, with some historians arguing for an Irish origin, see Brown, \\"Echternach Gospels\\"; Higham, Kingdom of Northumbria, pp. 155‚Äì160; Verey, \\"Lindisfarne of Rath Maelsigi?\\". The Lichfield Gospels are sometimes linked to Northumbria although this is far from certain; Higham, Kingdom of Northumbria, p. 158. The Codex Amiatinus was a product of Monkwearmouth-Jarrow, made on the orders of Abbot Ceolfrid, probably in the decade after Aldfrith's death.Nees, Early Medieval Art, pp. 164‚Äì167 at 165; Alcock, Kings and Warriors, pp. 353‚Äì354. Two significant items of jewellery from Northumbria in this period have survived. The Ripon Jewel, discovered in the precincts of Ripon Cathedral in 1977, is difficult to date but its grandeur and the location of the find have suggested a link with Bishop Wilfrid, whose rich furnishings of the church at Ripon are on record.Hall et al., \\"The Ripon Jewel\\". Bishop Cuthbert's pectoral cross was buried with him during Aldfrith's reign, either at his death in 687 or his reburial in 698 and is now at Durham Cathedral.Higham, Kingdom of Northumbria, p. 159. There are few surviving architectural or monumental remains from the period. The Bewcastle Cross, the Ruthwell Cross and the Hexham Cross are probably to be dated to one or two generations after Aldfrith's time.√ì Carrag√°in, \\"The Necessary Distance\\", p. 192, argues that the Agnus Dei imagery on both monuments places them in an 8th-century context; likewise √ì Carrag√°in, \\"Ruthwell Cross\\", proposes a date between 730 and 750 for Ruthwell; Bailey, \\"Bewcastle\\", estimates between 725 and 750 for Bewcastle; more generally see Alcock, Kings and warriors, pp. 377‚Äì382. Escomb Church is the best preserved Northumbrian church of the period, dated to the late 7th century. The ruined chapel at Heysham, overlooking Morecambe Bay, may be somewhat later in date.Blair, \\"Escomb\\"; Alcock, Kings and warriors, pp. 273‚Äì285. Silver coin of Aldfrith of Northumbria (686‚Äì705). OBVERSE: +AldFRIdUS, pellet-in-annulet; REVERSE: Lion with forked tail standing left. The Northumbrian coinage is thought to have begun during Aldfrith's reign. Early silver coins, known as sceattas, appeared, replacing the impractical gold thrymsa as a medium of exchange.Kirby, p. 146. Higham, pp. 166‚Äì168, gives an overview of Northumbrian coinage. Exceptionally for the period, Aldfrith's coins bear his name, rather than that of a moneyer, in an Irish uncial script. Most show a lion, with upraised tail.Gannon, pp. 125‚Äì126. Heirs, death, and succession Aldfrith was married to Cuthburh, sister of King Ine of Wessex; the marriage thus allied Aldfrith with one of the most powerful kings in Anglo-Saxon England. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that Aldfrith and Cuthburh separated, and Cuthburh established an abbey at Wimborne Minster where she was abbess. At least two sons were born to Aldfrith, but whether Cuthburh was their mother is unrecorded.Kirby, p. 145. Osred, born around 696 or 697, succeeded to the throne after a civil war following Aldfrith's death. Little is known of Offa, who is presumed to have been killed after being taken from Lindisfarne in 750 on the orders of King Eadberht of Northumbria.Kirby, pp. 143‚Äì150; Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, pp. 89‚Äì90 & 93. Osric, who was later king, may have been Aldfrith's son, or alternatively the son of Aldfrith's half-brother Alhfrith.Kirby, p. 147; Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, pp. 88 & 90. The 13th- century discovery of a tomb thought to be that of St Osana has led to the suggestion that Osana was the daughter of Aldfrith, although this view is not widely held by modern historians.Coulstock, Collegiate Church, p. 31. Aldfrith was said to have been ill for some time before his death, dying on 14 December 704 or 705.For the year of Aldfrith's death see Kirby, p. 145: the Irish annals record his death under the year 703, which is 704 A.D., while Bede gives 705 and a reign of nineteen years. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle adds that he died at Driffield in the East Riding of Yorkshire. The succession was disputed by Eadwulf, supported initially by Bishop Wilfrid, and supporters of Aldfrith's young son Osred, apparently led by Berht's kinsman Berhtfrith.Life of Wilfrid, Chapters 59‚Äì60; Bede, Ecclesiastical History, Book V, Chapter 19. The reports of Aldfrith's death in the Irish annals call him Aldfrith son of Oswiu, but some of these are glossed by later scribes with the name Flann F√≠na mac Ossu. A collection of wisdom literature attributed to Flann F√≠na, the Briathra Flainn Fhina Maic Ossu, has survived, though the text is not contemporary with Aldfrith as it is in Middle Irish, a form of Irish not in use until the 10th century.Ireland, pp. 70‚Äì75. > Learning merits respect. > Intelligence overcomes fury. > Truth should be supported. > Falsehood should be rebuked. > Iniquity should be corrected. > A quarrel merits mediation. > Stinginess should be spurned. > Arrogance deserves oblivion. > Good should be exalted.

The Lubang Islands are about southwest of Manila. There are seven islands in the group.Landor, Arnold Henry Savage (1904). The Gems of the East: Sixteen Thousand Miles of Research Travel Among Wild and Tame Tribes of Enchanting Islands, p. 10. Harper & Bros., New York. The island is divided into two municipalities. The largest settlement is the town of Lubang, the northwest end of the island. Its town center is about northwest of Tilik Port, the only safe anchorage on Lubang Island.Dow, John C. (1906). Philippine Islands Sailing Directions: Section II: Southwest and South Coasts of Luzon and Adjacent Islands from Manila to San Bernardino Straits (third edition), pp 19‚Äì20. U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, Manila. The southeastern half of the island is covered by the Municipality of Looc. The Lubang island group, which constitutes all the seven islands, are geographically distinct from any landmass, making it biologically unique - and endangered at the same time. The islands are under consideration to be set aside as a UNESCO tentative site. Geography Northwest to southeast the four main islands are Cabra Island, separated by a deep, wide channel from Lubang Island, then Ambil Island and finally Golo Island. The three smaller islands are Talinas Island, Malavatuan Island and Mandaui Island. *Cabra Island is mostly wooded and about long, rising to a height of about . It has a lighthouse at the northwest end of the island. *Lubang Island is about , being over in length and up to wide. It is the 34th largest island in the Philippine Archipelago. *Ambil Island is an extinct volcanic island rising to over and is about in area. During the earlier part of the Spanish Colonial Era, Ambil was reported to be in eruption.Daubeny, Charles (1848). \\"A description of active and extinct volcanos, of earthquakes, and of thermal springs\\", p.399. Richard and John E. Taylor, London. But when it was climbed by German scientist Carl Semper in the latter part of 19th century, he found no evidence that it has erupted in historical times.Becker, George F. (1901). \\"Report of the Geology of the Philippines\\", p.53. Government Printing Office, Wachington. It is the 93rd largest island in the Philippine archipelago. *Golo Island is long, narrow and flat lying, and is about in area. History The islands were originally settled by a proto-ethnic group that eventually advanced into present-day Tagalogs. The Spanish built a fort on Lubang Island, the San Vicente Bastion, on the western point of the entrance to Tilik Port. After World War II, Lubang Island was where Hiroo Onoda, a Japanese army intelligence officer, hid in the jungles when the Allies reclaimed the Philippines. He engaged in continuous, and sometimes deadly, guerrilla warfare against the United States and later against Philippine Commonwealth troops and paramilitary police. Despite flyers being dropped by airplanes in his hiding area, he adamantly believed that the war was not over yet. In March 1974, he was officially relieved of duty, 29 years after the end of the war, making him one of the last Japanese soldiers to surrender.Trefalt, Beatrice (1999) \\"A Straggler Returns: Onoda Hir≈ç and Japanese Memories of the War\\" War & Society 17(2): pp. 111‚Äì124, An independent documentary titled 'Onoda's War' was released in 2016. The documentary was shot on location around Vigo, Burol, Agkawayan and Looc. Administration The islands are administratively part of the province of Occidental Mindoro and are divided into two municipalities: Lubang and Looc. Lubang covers the northwestern half of Lubang Island (Cabra Island included), while Looc covers the remaining half of Lubang Island plus Ambil, Golo and the other islands. Looc Proper is divided into three major sections: BonBon, Gitna and Kanluran. These islands offer scenic delights, pristine waters, abundant and precious marine life, and scuba-diving opportunities. The coast lines boasts of white sand and unspoiled beauty. Economics Most of the population resides on Lubang Island, where Tilik Port is located. The main economic activity is fishing in the waters surrounding the islands and planting rice, garlic, peanut, and vegetables. However, with the islands fine white-sand coastlines, tourism is growing in economic importance. Fauna The Lubang Forest Mouse is endemic to the island.

He was an official of the Nazi Party and later a high-ranking leader of the Schutzstaffel (SS). As an associate of Adolf Eichmann, he had a leading role in Operation Reinhard, which organized the murder of more than one million mostly Polish Jews during the Holocaust in the Majdanek, Treblinka, Sobib√≥r and Be≈Ç≈ºec extermination camps.Kranjc, Joseph G.

Yale University Press, 2002. , . p. 287Mazower, Mark (2008) Hitler's Empire, pages 382, 384‚Äì387, . Historian Michael Allen described him as \\"the vilest individual in the vilest organization ever known\\". Because Globoƒçnik was a leading Nazi official, and perpetrator of not only the Holocaust but the enslavement and ethnic cleansing of millions of Poles and other Slavs, historians have been interested in accounts of Globoƒçnik's Slavic ancestry (his surname is Slavic). In his 2004 biography of Globoƒçnik, historian Joseph Kranjc devoted the entire first chapter to the debate concerning his ancestry. He says that Globoƒçnik was ridiculed by other Nazis for his surname, because Hitler classified Slavs as sub-human (Untermenschen).Poprzeczny, Odilo Globoƒçnik But senior Nazis such as Himmler defended him, saying that he was of Aryan origin and that his surname had been derived from slavicization.Poprzeczny, Odilo Globoƒçnik Globoƒçnik committed suicide shortly after being captured and detained by British soldiers. Early life and ancestry Odilo Globoƒçnik was born on 21 April 1904 in the Imperial Free City of Trieste, then the capital of the Austrian Littoral administrative region of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Italy). He was the second child of Franz Globoƒçnik, a cavalry lieutenant in the Austro-Hungarian Army. His father was unable to accumulate the money needed to get an officer's marriage permission and had to leave the service. As was the practice at this time, he was given a job in the Imperial and Royal Mail. Odilo's mother Anna, n√©e Petschinka, was born in Versecz, Kingdom of Hungary (now Vr≈°ac, Serbia); she was half-Serbian and half-Croatian. In 1914, the family left Trieste for Csekl√©sz, where Franz Globoƒçnik was recalled to active duty after the outbreak of the First World War.Poprzeczny, Odilo Globoƒçnik, pp. 9‚Äì14. The same year, Odilo Globoƒçnik joined the army, via a military school. The war ended his military education prematurely. Odilo moved with his family to Klagenfurt in Carinthia. There as a teenager, he joined the pro- Austrian volunteer militia fighting Slovene volunteers and, later, the Yugoslav Army during the Carinthian War (1918‚Äì19).Siegfried J. Pucher: ‚Äû‚Ä¶ in der Bewegung f√ºhrend t√§tig‚Äú. Odilo Globoƒçnik. K√§mpfer f√ºr den ‚ÄûAnschlu√ü‚Äú. Vollstrecker des Holocaust. Drava, Klagenfurt 1997, p. 18 In 1920, he worked as an underground propagandist for the Austrian cause during the Carinthian Plebiscite.Siegfried J. Pucher: ‚Äû‚Ä¶ in der Bewegung f√ºhrend t√§tig‚Äú. Odilo Globoƒçnik. K√§mpfer f√ºr den ‚ÄûAnschlu√ü‚Äú. Vollstrecker des Holocaust. Drava, Klagenfurt 1997, p. 19 He later enrolled at the H√∂here Staatsgewerbeschule (a higher vocational school for mechanical engineering), where he passed his Matura (the Austrian equivalent of the German Abitur) and graduated with honours.Michael D. Miller and Andreas Schulz-Gauleiter: The Regional Leaders of the Nazi Party and their Deputies, 1925‚Äì1945, page 245. He worked a variety of jobs, such as being a porter at the railway station, in order to help support his family financially. Globoƒçnik first became active in politics in 1922, when he became a prominent member of pre-Nazi Carinthian paramilitary organisations and was seen wearing a swastika. At the time, he was a building tradesman, introduced to his job while engaged to Grete Michner. Her father, Emil Michner, had talked to the director of K√ÑEWAG, a hydropower plant, and secured Globoƒçnik a job as a technician and construction supervisor.Poprzeczny, Odilo Globoƒçnik, pp. 24‚Äì25. After he entered politics, Globoƒçnik faced ridicule from the German and international media for his Slavic surname,Poprzeczny, Odilo Globoƒçnik, p. 12. in light of the Nazis' (including Globoƒçnik's) extreme racism against Slavs. Globoƒçnik would assiduously maintain that he was of Germanic ancestry. This was important, since Slavs were considered sub-human (Untermenschen) and eventually subjugated to genocide by the Third Reich. He said that his paternal grandfather was an \\"Aryan\\" who was culturally slavicized, but maintained his Germanic blood. Historians have often dismissed this as a ruse. But historian Joseph Popzeczny argued in his 2004 biography of Globoƒçnik that the story was true, citing Austro-Hungarian census data from 1910 indicating that the Globoƒçniks were ethnic Germans.Poprzeczny, Odilo Globoƒçnik, p. 16. Nazi Party and SS career Gauleiter of Vienna, 1938 In August 1933, Globoƒçnik was arrested for the first time, for attempting to contact imprisoned Nazis in Klagenfurt. This was the same year that he became a member of the Austrian SS. He was arrested because of his public support for the Nazi Party (NSDAP), as he had become a member of the party in 1931 while he was in Carinthia. Although he was arrested four times between 1933 and 1935, he served only a little over a year in jail.Poprzeczny, Odilo Globocnik, pp. 28‚Äì29. Heinrich Himmler intervened on his behalf, after two years of arguments between Globoƒçnik and the authorities. His first documented activity for the NSDAP occurred in 1931, when he was documented as distributing propaganda for the party. By this point he had nearly abandoned his work as a building tradesman, and attached himself very closely to the NSDAP. He was assigned to develop a courier and intelligence service for the NSDAP, which channeled funds from the German Reich into Austria. In June 1933, in Vienna, a bomb was thrown at the shop of Jewish jeweller Norbert Futterweit, killing him. This was one of the first murders in Austria attributable to the Nazis. A number of historians believe that Globoƒçnik was involved in the attack.Poprzeczny, Odilo Globocnik, pp. 32‚Äì34. Globoƒçnik joined the Schutzstaffel (SS) on 1 September 1934. His devotion to the Nazi cause paid off, as he quickly climbed the ladder of the party apparatus in his native Austria. He became a Deputy Gauleiter briefly in Vienna and then in Carinthia between January and May 1933. He was appointed as the head of the party intelligence apparatus in Carinthia, serving from 1934 to 1936. From September 1936 to May 1938, he served as the Chief of Staff of the National Leadership of the Austrian Nazi Party under Hubert Klausner. Globoƒçnik was a key player in the usurpation of the Austrian government by the Nazis.Poprzeczny, Odilo Globocnik, pp. 45‚Äì59 With the Anschluss, Nazi Germany annexed Austria on 12 March 1938.William L. Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; Secker & Warburg; London; 1960; pp. 325‚Äì329 Globoƒçnik was rewarded with an appointment as a State Secretary in the Nazi government, set up by Chancellor Arthur Seyss-Inquart on 15 March. On 10 April 1938, he was elected to the Reichstag. Next came his appointment as Gauleiter of Vienna on 22 May 1938 by Adolf Hitler.Poprzeczny, Odilo Globocnik, pp. 45‚Äì59. > In his early tenure as Gauleiter, Globoƒçnik espoused Nazi anti-Jewish > philosophy: \\"I will not recoil from radical interventions for the solution > of Jewish questions.\\" Later that same year he opened Vienna's first anti- > Semitic political exhibition, which was attended by 10,000 visitors on the > first day. Prominent at the exhibition and received enthusiastically by the > public was the film, \\"The Eternal Jew\\".Robin O'Neill, The Belzec Death Camp > and the Origin of Jewish Genocide at Galicia (Hebrew and Jewish Department, > University College, London: 2002), Chapter IV, cited in Poprzeczny, Odilo > Globocnik, p. 64. Early gestures of accommodation to the new government by Cardinal Innitzer did not assuage the Austrian Nazi radicals, foremost among them the young Gauleiter Globoƒçnik.Mark Mazower; Hitler's Empire ‚Äì Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe; Penguin; 2008; ; pp. 51‚Äì52 He launched a crusade against the Church, and the Nazis confiscated property, closed Catholic organisations and sent many priests to Dachau. Anger at the treatment of the Church in Austria grew quickly, and in October 1938 the first act of overt mass resistance to the new regime took place. A rally of thousands left Mass in Vienna chanting \\"Christ is our F√ºhrer\\", before being dispersed by police.Mark Mazower; Hitler's Empire ‚Äì Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe; Penguin; 2008; ; p.52 A Nazi mob ransacked Cardinal Innitzer's residence, after he denounced Nazi persecution of the Church.William L. Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; Secker & Warburg; London; p 349-350\\" Globoƒçnik was relieved of his posts and stripped of his party honours on 30 January 1939, when it was discovered that he was involved in illegal foreign currency speculation. As punishment, Himmler transferred Globoƒçnik to the Waffen-SS, in the rank of corporal, where he served with SS Standarte \\"Germania\\" during the Polish campaign.Poprzeczny, Odilo Globocnik, pp. 76‚Äì80. Himmler liked Globoƒçnik and recognised the value of the ruthless Austrian. In late 1939, Globoƒçnik was pardoned, promoted to SS-Brigadef√ºhrer, and assigned to Lublin province.Poprzeczny, Odilo Globocnik, pp. 80, 83. =Crimes in occupied Poland= On 9 November 1939, Himmler appointed Globoƒçnik as SS and Police Leader in the Lublin district of the General Government territory. After the initially disappointing party career, Globoƒçnik now had a second chance in the ranks of the SS and the police.Poprzeczny, Odilo Globocnik, p. 90. On 16 February 1940, Globoƒçnik declared: \\"The evacuated Jews should feed themselves and be supported by their countrymen, as these Jews have enough [food]. If this does not succeed, one should let them starve.\\"Saul Friedl√§nder. The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1939-1945, p. 35.Dieter Pohl. Von der \\"Judenpolitik\\" zum Judenmord: Der Distrikt Lublin des Generalgouvernements, 1939‚Äì1944. Frankfurt am Main, 1993, p. 52. In the following years, Globoƒçnik was responsible for: #'Liquidating' the Warsaw Ghetto, which contained about 500,000 Jews, the largest Jewish community in Europe and the second-largest in the world after New York. #Liquidating the Bialystok Ghetto, which had strongly resisted German occupation. #Resettling a large number of Poles under the premise of 'ethnic cleansing'. #Implementation and supervision of the Lublin reservation, to which 95,000 Jews were deported, with its adjacent network of forced labour camps in the Lublin district. He was also in charge of over 45,000 Jewish labourers. =Extermination camps= Action T4 bus for the transport to Hartheim Euthanasia Centre There are indications that Globoƒçnik, along with a chief accomplice Christian Wirth, may have originated the concept of the extermination camp and industrialised murder, and been the person to suggest it to Himmler. At a two-hour meeting with Himmler on 13 October 1941, Globoƒçnik received verbal approval to start construction work on the Belzec extermination camp, the first such camp in the General Government.Saul Friedl√§nder. The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1939-1945, p. 283.Heinrich Himmler. Der Dienstkalender, pp. 233-34 n. 35.Christopher Browning. The Origins of the Final Solution, pp. 359‚Äì360. Shortly beforehand, in September 1941, Globoƒçnik had been visited by Phillip Bouhl er and Victor Brack, the top officials in the Fuhrer Chancellery responsible for the Action T4 \\"euthanasia\\" program, which had been using gas chambers disguised as shower rooms to execute many of its victims.Henry Friedlander. The Origins of Nazi Genocide, From Euthanasia to the Final Solution, pp. 86‚Äì98, 110.Yitzhak Arad. Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka, The Operation Reinhard Death Camps, p. 9. On or about 1 October 1941, Globoƒçnik had written a memorandum to Himmler containing proposals for actions against the Jews \\"of a security policy nature,\\" and the 13 October meeting was held to discuss this memorandum and related subjects.Peter Longerich. Holocaust, the Nazi Persecution and Murder of the Jews, p. 294Peter Longerich. Heinrich Himmler, p. 547. A colleague's contemporaneous letter reflects Globoƒçnik's state of mind at the time of the 13 October meeting: Globoƒçnik said it was necessary to undertake a \\"cleansing of the entire [General Government] of Jews and Poles\\" and was \\"full of good and far-reaching plans\\" to accomplish this.Peter Longerich. Holocaust, the Nazi Persecution and Murder of the Jews, pp. 294‚Äì95. There are indications that Globoƒçnik may have begun a crude experimental gassing facility in the woods near Belzec shortly before his mid-October meeting with Himmler.Christopher Browning. The Origins of the Final Solution, pp. 364‚Äì365. At the 13 October 1941 meeting with Himmler, Globoƒçnikproposed exterminating the Jews in assembly-line fashion in a concentration camp, using gas chambers.Christopher Browning. The Origins of the Final Solution, p. 360. On 14 October 1941 ‚Äì the day after he had met with Globoƒçnik ‚Äì Himmler held a five-hour meeting with Reinhard Heydrich to discuss \\"executions\\", following which other extermination camp gassing sites were built.Christopher Browning. The Origins of the Final Solution, pp. 365‚Äì366. Days later, Himmler forbade all further Jewish emigration from Reich territory \\"in view of the forthcoming 'Final Solution' to the Jewish question.\\"Christopher Browning. The Origins of the Final Solution, pp. 368‚Äì369. The gassing facilities that Globoƒçnik established at Belzec soon after his 13 October meeting with Himmler were designed by T4 programme personnel assigned to him. They used carbon monoxide, as the T4 programme had done.Peter Longerich, Holocaust, the Nazi Persecution and Murder of the Jews, p. 280Henry Friedlander The Origins of Nazi Genocide, From Euthanasia to the Final Solution, pp. 96, 99 Before it became an extermination camp, Belzec had been part of Himmler's and Globoƒçnik's Burggraben project. The construction of three more death camps, Sobibor and Maidanek in the Lublin district and Treblinka at Ma≈Çkinia G√≥rna, followed in 1942. Globoƒçnik was complicit in the extermination of more than 1.5 million Polish, Czech, Dutch, French, Russian, Slovak, German, Portuguese, Turkish, Spanish and Austrian Jews, as well as a smaller number of non-Jews, in the death camps which he organised and supervised. He exploited Jews and non-Jews as slave labourers in his own forced labour camps. He was responsible for seizing the properties and valuables of murdered inmates while in charge of Operation Reinhard. Although other arms of the Nazi state were also involved in the overall management of the greater concentration camp system, Globoƒçnik had control over the Aktion Reinhard camps, and any orders that he received came directly from Himmler.Saul Friedl√§nder. The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1939-1945, p. 346. From 1942‚Äì1943 he also oversaw the beginning of the Generalplan Ost, the plan to expel Poles from their lands and resettle those territories with German settlers (see Zamo≈õƒá Uprising). On 9 November 1942, Globoƒçnik was promoted to SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer and Generalleutnant der Polizei. =Activities in Italy= After the Armistice of Cassibile, Globoƒçnik was appointed as Higher SS and Police Leader of the Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral of Italy on 13 September 1943.Klee, Ernst: Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945?, p. 187. Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag, Zweite aktualisierte Auflage, Frankfurt am Main 2003 After the completion of Operation Reinhard in Poland, he was sent to Trieste, his hometown. Having looted assets stolen from Holocaust victims at death camps in occupied Poland, Globoƒçnik went to Italy with a number of his men who had taken part in Aktion Tiergarten 4 including Franz Stangl from Treblinka and Franz Reichleitner from Sobibor. A few days after 8 September 1943, Christian Wirth arrived in Trieste. Together, they converted an old rice mill on the outskirts of the city into a detention centre complete with a crematorium, known as Risiera di San Sabba (in Slovene: Ri≈æarna). At San Sabba, thousands of Italian Jews, partisans and other political dissidents were interrogated, tortured and murdered under the direction of these men after the 1943 downfall of Benito Mussolini and the German takeover of the country. In Slovene Littoral, Slovene Partisans were fought both by Germans and by the Littoral Home Guard, which was also under Globoƒçnik's direct command. It provided Germans with lists of locations of Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation hideouts and suspicious individuals (described as propagandists).Kranjc, Joseph G. (2013).To Walk with the Devil, University of Toronto Press, With the advance of Allied troops, Globoƒçnik retreated into Austrian Carinthia and finally went into hiding high in the mountains near Weissensee, still in company of his closest staff members. Death Globoƒçnik was tracked down and captured by a British armoured cavalry unit on 31 May 1945 in Carinthia, Austria. A unit from the 4th Queen's Own Hussars, found him on the M√∂slacher Alm, a mountain in the Eastern Alps, with seven other wanted Nazis including Georg Michalsen, Friedrich Rainer, Ernst Lerch, Hermann H√∂fle, Karl Hellesberger, Hugo Herzog and Friedrich Pl√∂b.Prosecuting Nazi War Criminals, fold3.com; accessed 20 January 2016. Globoƒçnik was taken to Paternion in Villach-Land District to be interrogated. However, before he was questioned, Globoƒçnik committed suicide by biting on a cyanide capsule. His body was taken to be buried in a local churchyard, but the priest reportedly refused to have 'the body of such a man' resting in consecrated ground. A grave was dug outside the churchyard, next to an outer wall, and the body was buried without ceremony.Poprzeczny, Odilo Globocnik, pp. 366‚Äì82 =Conspiracy theories= Despite contemporary photographs of Globoƒçnik's corpse and reliable reports, such as the Regimental Diary and Field Reports of the 4th Queen's Own Hussars, detailing the circumstances of his capture and suicide, urban legends suggested he survived the war, or that circumstances of his death differed. Prior to the 1980s, there was debate over the circumstances of Globoƒçnik's survival; some had speculated that his death in either early May or June 1945 was at the hands of either partisans or a Jewish revenge squad. A false version of Globoƒçnik's fate has circulated that says he was turned over to U.S. intelligence by the British. This is based on an \\"official US document signed by US CIC S/A Operations Officer Andrew L. Venters, dated 27 October 1948, more than three years after his supposed death\\". But, this document was exposed as a forgery in the 1980s by the investigative writer and historian, Gitta Sereny; she gives all details in a long article in the Observer newspaper.\\"Spin Time For Hitler\\", Observer, London, 21 April 1996.

It was licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL, and is one of the most famous products to be based completely on AOLserver. Although there were several forks of the project, the only one that is still actively maintained is OpenACS. Features of ACS included a core set of APIs, datamodels, and database routines for coordinating information common to all community web applications, as well as modules such as workflow management, CMS, messaging, bug/issue tracking, project tracking, e-commerce, and bboards. History ACS was built in the mid-1990s to support the photo.net online community as well as a variety of Internet services from Hearst Corporation. The initial developers included Tracy Adams, Ben Adida, Eve Andersson, Jin S. Choi, Philip Greenspun, Aurelius Prochazka, and Brian Tivol. The ACS was originally written using the Oracle database and AOLserver threaded web server and thus was a combination of SQL, HTML templates, and Tcl code to merge database results with templates. ACS 3.4, however, was also available with Java Server Pages to run with Apache and Tomcat. In 2001, the code tree was forked, with the Tcl code base being maintained and refactored by one group of developers, while the product line was being re-written in Java EE. In 2002, Red Hat acquired ArsDigita. As a result of this, the Java version was renamed \\"Red Hat CCM\\", and official support for the Tcl version ceased.

Etymology The term \\"almas\\" and numerous variants thereof appear in Mongolian, Turkic languages, and Iranian languages. Writing in 1964, scholar P. R. Rinƒçen says that \\"the origin of the old name is quite unknown ‚Ä¶ and it does not lend itself for translation in other languages\\". The name is connected to a variety of place names (toponyms) in southwestern Mongolia, including Almasyn Dobo ('the Hills of Almases'), Almasyn Ulan Oula ('the Red Mountains of Almases') and ('the Red Rocks of Almases'). Folk belief in the almas in Oburkhangai and Bayankhongor has resulted in a name-avoidance taboo there, wherein the entities may be referred to as akhai, meaning 'uncle-brother'. The folk traditions of Darkhad include the deity Almas khara Tenguer, meaning 'Almas the Black God' and associated with highland prairies and mountain forests. According to Rinƒçen, the god may be offered edible wild roots and wild animal meat. Description Nikolay Przhevalsky describes the almas, as related to him under the name kung-guressu (\\"man-beast\\"), as follows: > We were told that it had a flat face like that of a human being, and that it > often walked on two legs, that its body was covered with a thick black fur, > and its feet armed with enormous claws; that its strength was terrible, and > that not only were hunters afraid of attacking it, but that the inhabitants > removed their habitations from those parts of the country which it visited. Heaney suggests that the almas should be identified with the Arimaspi, a group of legendary humanoid creatures said to inhabit the Riphean Mountains.  In science  In 1992, a group of scientists went on an expedition to search for the almas in the Caucasus Mountains. A 2014 study concluded that hair samples attributed to the almas were in fact from species including Ursus arctos, Equus caballus, and Bos taurus. Guti√©rrez and Pine concluded that several of these samples were from the brown bear.

Early life Tamayo was born in Oaxaca, Mexico in 1899 to parents Manuel Arellanes and Florentina Tamayo. His mother was a seamstress and his father was a shoemaker. His mother died of tuberculosis 1911. Tamayo's Zapotec heritage is often cited as an early influence. Mexico City to live with his aunt, where he spent a lot of time working alongside her in the city's fruit markets. While there, he devoted himself to helping his family with their small business. However, after a while, Tamayo's aunt enrolled him at Escuela Nacional de Artes Plasticas at San Carlos in 1917 to study art. As a student, he experimented with and was influenced by Cubism, Impressionism and Fauvism, among other popular art movements of the time, but with a distinctly Mexican feel. Although Tamayo studied drawing at the Academy of Art at San Carlos as a young adult, he became dissatisfied and eventually decided to study on his own. That was when he began working for Jos√© Vasconcelos at the Department of Ethnographic Drawings (1921); he was later appointed head of the department by Vasconcelos. Career Homenaje al Sol (tribute to the sun) The intention of this work was to honor the nomads and natives of the Northeast who considered the sun as a god. Rufino Tamayo, along with other muralists such as Rivera, Orozco, and Siqueiros, represented the twentieth century in their native country of Mexico. After the Mexican Revolution, Tamayo devoted himself to creating a distinct identity in his work. He expressed what he envisioned as the traditional Mexico and eschewed the overt political art of such contemporaries as Jos√© Clemente Orozco, Diego Rivera, Oswaldo Guayasamin and David Alfaro Siqueiros. He disagreed with these muralists in their belief that the revolution was necessary for the future of Mexico but considered, instead, that the revolution would harm Mexico. In his painting, Ni√±os Jugando con Fuego (Children Playing with Fire, 1947), Tamayo shows two individuals being burnt by a fire they have created, a symbol of the Mexican people being injured by its own choice and action. Tamayo claimed, \\"We are in a dangerous situation, and the danger is that man may be absorbed and destroyed by what he has created\\". Due to his opinion, he was characterized by some as a \\"traitor\\" to the political cause. Tamayo came to feel that he could not freely express his art; he therefore decided in 1926 to leave Mexico and move to New York City. Prior to his departure, Tamayo organized a one-man show of his work in Mexico City where he was noticed for his individuality. The artist returned to Mexico in 1929 to have another solo show, this time being met with high praise and media coverage. Tamayo Trayectos reopening exhibition of the Museo Rufino Tamayo, Mexico City in the 2012. Rufino Tamayo's legacy in the history of art lies in his oeuvre of original graphic prints in which he cultivated every technique. Rufino Tamayo's graphic work, produced between 1925 and 1991, includes woodcuts, lithographs, etchings and \\"Mixografia\\" prints. With the help of Mexican printer and engineer Luis Remba, Tamayo expanded the technical and aesthetic possibilities of the graphic arts by developing a new medium which they named Mixografia. This technique is a unique fine art printing process that allows for the production of prints with three-dimensional texture. It not only registered the texture and volume of Rufino Tamayo's design but also granted the artist freedom to use any combination of solid materials in its creation. Rufino Tamayo was delighted with the Mixografia process and created some 80 original Mixographs. One of their most famous Mixografia is titled Dos Personajes Atacados por Perros (Two Characters Attacked by Dogs). In 1935, Tamayo joined the Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios (LEAR). The LEAR was an organization in which Mexican artists could express through painting and writing their responses towards the revolutionary war and governmental policies then current in M√©xico. Although Tamayo did not agree with Siqueiros and Orozco, they were chosen along with four others to represent their art in the first American Artists' Congress in New York. Now married, Rufino and Olga had planned on staying in New York only for the duration of the event; however, they made New York their permanent home for the next decade and a half. In 1948, Tamayo's first major retrospective was held at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City. Although his positions remained controversial, his popularity was high. Uncomfortable with the continuing political controversy, Tamayo and Olga moved to Paris in 1949 where they remained for the next decade. Tamayo also enjoyed portraying women in his paintings. His early works included many nudes, a subject which eventually disappeared in his later career. However, he often painted his wife Olga, showing her struggles through color choices and facial expressions. The shared difficulties of painter and wife can be seen in the portrait Rufino and Olga, circa 1934, where the couple appears broken by life's obstacles. Tamayo also painted murals, some of which are displayed inside Palacio Nacional de Bellas Artes opera house in Mexico City, such as Nacimiento de la nacionalidad (Birth of the Nationality, 1952). Influences Painting by Mexican artist Rufino Tamayo Tamayo was influenced by many artists. Mar√≠a Izquierdo, a fellow Mexican artist with whom he lived with for a time, taught Tamayo precision in his color choices. He selected colors true to his Mexican environment. He argued, \\"Mexicans are not a gay race but a tragic one ...\\" Other influences came from Tamayo's cultural heritage. One can say that Tamayo was one of the few artists of his era who enjoyed Mexico's ethnic differences. He enjoyed the fusion of Spanish-Mexican-Indian blood and that is shown in some of his art pieces. In Lion and Horse (1942), Tamayo used pre-Columbian ceramics. Tamayo was proud of his Mexican culture because his culture nourished him and, by traveling to other countries, his love for Mexico became greater. Tamayo's acute awareness of the disregard shown Mexican artists influenced him profoundly. For example, according to Jose Carlos Ramirez, \\"Tamayo's work did not have much value\\". Many people doubted that Mexican artists could actually create art. Under the D√≠az regime, artists of Mexican origin were ignored by society; it was commonly held that they lacked the skills to surpass artists of European descent. Outside Mexico From 1937 to 1949, Tamayo and his wife Olga lived in New York where he painted some of his most memorable works. He had his first show in New York City at the Valentine Gallery. He gained credibility thereby and proceeded to exhibit works at the Knoedler Gallery and Marlborough Gallery. While in New York, Tamayo instructed Helen Frankenthaler at the Dalton School Tamayo, while in the United States, attended important exhibitions which influenced his art mechanics. From Ingres to Picasso and French art exhibitions, Tamayo was introduced to Impressionism, Fauvism, and Cubism. Also, at an exhibition in Brooklyn in 1928, Tamayo came into contact with Henri Matisse, the French artist. In a 1926 exhibition, 39 of Tamayo's works were displayed at the Weyhe Gallery in New York just a month after his arrival into the United States. This stands in stark contrast to the few showings which were held during his early career in M√©xico. The artist's sojourn in New York dramatically increased his recognition not only in the United States but in Mexico and other countries also. Style Nacimiento de nuestra nacionalidad by Rufino Tamayo on the first floor of the Palacio de Bellas Artes Tamayo explained his approach to Paul Westheim as follows: \\"As the number of colors we use decreases, the wealth of possibilities increases\\". Tamayo favored using few colors rather than many; he asserted that fewer colors in a painting gave the art greater force and meaning. Tamayo's unique color choices are evident in the painting Tres personajes cantando (Three singers), 1981. In this painting, Tamayo employs pure colors such as red and purple; his restraint in the choice of color here confirms his belief that fewer colors, far from limiting the painting, actually enlarge the composition's possibilities. With that being said, Octavio Paz, author of the book Rufino Tamayo, argues that, \\"Time and again we have been told that Tamayo is a great colourist; but it should be added that this richness of colour is the result of sobriety\\". By being pure or, as Paz explained, sober with his color choice, Tamayo's paintings were enriched, not impoverished.

In 1959, Tamayo and his wife returned to Mexico permanently and Tamayo built an art museum in his home town of Oaxaca, the Museo Rufino Tamayo. In 1972, Tamayo was the subject of the documentary film, Rufino Tamayo: The Sources of his Art by Gary Conklin. The Tamayo Contemporary Art Museum (Museo Tamayo de Arte Contempor√°neo), located on Mexico City's Paseo de la Reforma boulevard where it crosses Chapultepec Park, was opened in 1981 as a repository for the collections that Rufino Tamayo and his wife acquired during their lifetimes, and ultimately donated to the nation. Tamayo painted his last painting in 1990, at the age of 90,Luna y Sol(Moon and Sun) Tamayo's work has been displayed in museums throughout the world, including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City, The Phillips Collection in Washington, the Cleveland Museum of Art in Cleveland, Ohio, the Naples Museum of Art in Naples, Florida and The Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid, Spain. Death On June 12, 1991, Tamayo was admitted to Mexico City's National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition for respiratory and heart failure. He suffered a heart attack and died on June 24, 1991. Before Tamayo died, he continued creating art pieces in his late years. He was very productive at that stage in life. To show how grateful people were towards his art, there were several important exhibitions and publications that were organized after his death. Theft and recovery Tamayo's 1970 painting Tres Personajes was bought by a Houston man as a gift for his wife in 1977, then stolen from their storage locker in 1987 during a move. In 2003, Elizabeth Gibson found the painting in the trash on a New York City curb. Although she knew little about modern art, Gibson felt the painting \\"had power\\" and took it without knowing its origin or market value. She spent four years trying to learn about the work, eventually learning from the PBS website that it had been featured on an episode of Antiques Roadshow. After seeing the Missing Masterpieces segment about Tres Personajes, Gibson and the former owner arranged to sell the painting at a Sotheby's auction. In November, 2007 Gibson received a $15,000 reward plus a portion of the $1,049,000 auction sale price.

The town proper has approximately 3100 inhabitants. The municipality population in 2011 was 11,772, in an area of . History The castle and wall of √ìbidos, view from the west. Azulejo in an √ìbidos city gate Top view of Santa Maria The name \\"√ìbidos\\" is a Latinised (oppidum, citadel) derivation of the older Celtic \\"Eburobricio\\". The municipality had its growth from a Roman settlement near the foothills of an elevated escarpment. The region of √ìbidos, extending from the Atlantic to the interior of Estremadura Province along the rivers and lakes has been inhabited since the late Paleolithic. A settlement was constructed by early Celt tribes, that was later a centre of trade for the Phoenicians. Archeological evidence from the base of the medieval tower (south of Facho) at √ìbidos Castle indicates Roman construction linked to an outpost of the Roman civitas of Eburobrittium, a large urban area that has been under excavation. Archeological surveys determined the remains of a forum, baths and other Roman structures near the settlement. After the fall of Rome, the region came under the influence of the Visigoths, although specific records are missing. The Roman town of Eburobrittium was abandoned in the 5th century for the more secure hilltop where today the principal settlement is located. Sometime after 713 the Moors established a fortification on this mountain, while a Christian community of Mozarabs lived in the Moncharro neighbourhood. The area was taken from the Moors by the first King of Portugal, Afonso Henriques, in 1148. Tradition states that one knight, Gon√ßalo Mendes da Maia, was responsible for the successful storming of the Moorish castle. The retaking of √ìbidos was a final stage in the conquest of the Estremadura Province region, after the settlements of Santar√©m, Lisbon and Torres Vedras. Following the control of the region, the settlement received its first foral (charter) in 1195, during the reign of King Sancho I. In 1210, King Afonso II gave the title of this village to Queen Urraca. Since then, √ìbidos has often been patronized by the Queens of Portugal, giving rise to its informal title as Vila das Rainhas (); several royal consorts enriched the village with donations from the Middle Ages until the 16th century. The castle and walls of √ìbidos were remodelled during the reign of King Dinis I. The limestone and marble structure was strengthened and elaborated, while the keep was created in the 14th century, by King Fernando. By the time of the first remodelling project, the settlement had also grown beyond the gates of the castle. The Church of Santa Maria in √ìbidos was the setting for the wedding of King Afonso V to his cousin, Princess Isabella of Coimbra, on 15 August 1441, when they were both still children aged 9 and 10, respectively. Administrative reforms conducted by King Manuel I at √ìbidos in 1513, included the institution of a formal charter and major requalification of the urban area. The 1755 earthquake caused damage to the village walls, a few churches, and many buildings, and resulted in the loss of architecture of Arab or Medieval inspiration. Similarly, the Peninsular Wars were fought in the vicinity of √ìbidos, including the Battle of Roli√ßa. More recently, the village was a centre of government and meeting place for those involved in the 1974 Carnation Revolution, linking it to the armed forces movement revolt. Geography Main street of √ìbidos Located on the Atlantic Ocean coast, the municipality is bounded in the northeast and east by Caldas da Rainha, in the south by Bombarral, in the southeast by Lourinh√£ and in the west by Peniche. Administratively, it is divided into 7 civil parishes (freguesias): * A dos Negros * Amoreira * Gaeiras * Olho Marinho * Santa Maria, S√£o Pedro e Sobral da Lagoa * Usseira * Vau Tourism The area of the town of √ìbidos is located on a hilltop, encircled by a fortified wall. √ìbidos remains a well-preserved example of medieval architecture; its streets, squares, walls and its castle are a popular tourist destination. The castle now houses a pousada. The municipality is also home to the famous Praia D'el Rey golf complex, one of the top golf resorts in Europe, and Royal √ìbidos - Spa & Golf Resort. =√ìbidos Medieval Market= Each July √ìbidos castle hosts a traditional 'Medieval Market'. For two weeks the castle and the surrounding town recreate the spirit of medieval Europe. Flowing banners and heraldic flags set the mood together with hundreds of entertainers and stall holders dressed as merchants, jugglers, jesters, wandering minstrels, soldiers and more. Visitors can shop at the traditional handcrafts fair or watch medieval shows, horse displays and a costumed parade that winds its way through the streets. There are also displays of jousting knights and armed combat. Spit roasted hog, hearty soups, rabbit, lamb, cod, quail, sausages and other grilled meats are just some of the many medieval style meals on offer from dozens of \\"taverns\\" and stalls spread throughout the market. Drinking from pewter tankards and eating from wooden trencher all adds to the experience. Obidos is also famous for its bookstores. There are 14 bookstores, one of which is in a church, another one sells fish as well as books.

Anhydrous copper nitrate forms deep blue-green crystals and sublimes in a vacuum at 150-200 ¬∞C. Copper nitrate also occurs as five different hydrates, the most common ones being the hemipentahydrate and trihydrate. These materials are more commonly encountered in commerce than in the laboratory. Synthesis and reactions for copper nitrate  Aqueous solution of copper(II) nitrate. Hydrated copper nitrate can be prepared by hydration of the anhydrous material or by treating copper metal with an aqueous solution of silver nitrate or concentrated nitric acid: :Cu + 4 HNO3 ‚Üí Cu(NO3)2 \\\\+ 2 H2O + 2 NO2 Anhydrous Cu(NO3)2 forms when copper metal is treated with N2O4: :Cu + 2 N2O4 ‚Üí Cu(NO3)2 \\\\+ 2 NO Attempted dehydration of any of the hydrated copper(II) nitrates by heating instead affords the oxides, not Cu(NO3)2. At 80 ¬∞C, the hydrates convert to \\"basic copper nitrate\\" (Cu2(NO3)(OH)3), which converts to CuO at 180 ¬∞C. Exploiting this reactivity, copper nitrate can be used to generate nitric acid by heating it until decomposition and passing the fumes directly into water. This method is similar to the last step in the Ostwald process. The equations are as follows: :2 Cu(NO3)2 ‚Üí 2 CuO + 4 NO2 \\\\+ O2 :3NO2 \\\\+ H2O ‚Üí 2HNO3 \\\\+ NO Natural basic copper nitrates include the rare minerals gerhardtite and rouaite, both being polymorphs of Cu2(NO3)(OH)3 substance.Mindat, http://www.mindat.org/min-10588.html Structure =Anhydrous copper(II) nitrate= Anhydrous copper(II) nitrate has been crystallized in two solvate- free polymorphs. Œ±- and Œ≤-Cu(NO3)2 are fully 3D coordination polymer networks. The alpha form has only one Cu environment, with [4+1] coordination, but the beta form has two different copper centers, one with [4+1] and one that is square planar. The nitromethane solvate also features \\"[4+ 1] coordination\\", with four short Cu-O bonds of approximately 200 pm and one longer bond at 240 pm. They are coordination polymers, with infinite chains of copper(II) centers and nitrate groups. In the gas phase, copper(II) nitrate features two bidentate nitrate ligands (see image at upper right). Thus, evaporation of the solid entails \\"cracking\\" to give the copper(II) nitrate molecule. =Hydrated copper(II) nitrate= Five hydrates have been reported: the monohydrate (Cu(NO3)2¬∑H2O), the sesquihydrate (Cu(NO3)2¬∑1.5H2O), the hemipentahydrate (Cu(NO3)2¬∑2.5H2O), a trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2¬∑3H2O),J. Garaj, Sbornik Prac. Chem.-Technol. Fak. Svst., Cskosl. 1966, pp. 35‚Äì39. and a hexahydrate ([Cu(H2O)6](NO3)2). The hexahydrate is interesting because the Cu-O distances are all equal, not revealing the usual effect of Jahn-Teller distortion that is otherwise characteristic of octahedral Cu(II) complexes. This non-effect is attributed to the strong hydrogen bonding that limits the elasticity of the Cu-O bonds. Applications Copper(II) nitrate finds a variety of applications, the main one being its conversion to copper(II) oxide, which is used as catalyst for a variety of processes in organic chemistry. Its solutions are used in textiles and polishing agents for other metals. Copper nitrates are found in some pyrotechnics.H.Wayne Richardson \\"Copper Compounds\\" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. . It is often used in school laboratories to demonstrate chemical voltaic cell reactions. It is a component in some ceramic glazes and metal patinas. =Organic synthesis= Copper nitrate, in combination with acetic anhydride, is an effective reagent for nitration of aromatic compounds, known as the Menke nitration in honor of the Dutch chemist who discovered that metal nitrates are effective reagents for nitration. Hydrated copper nitrate adsorbed onto clay affords a reagent called \\"Claycop\\". The resulting blue- colored clay is used as a slurry, for example for the oxidation of thiols to disulfides. Claycop is also used to convert dithioacetals to carbonyls.Balogh, M. \\"Copper(II) Nitrate‚ÄìK10 Bentonite Clay\\" in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis (Ed: L. Paquette) 2004, J. Wiley & Sons, New York. . A related reagent based on montmorillonite has proven useful for the nitration of aromatic compounds.

A c√¢mara municipal (, meaning literally municipal chamber and often referred to simply as c√¢mara) is a type of municipal governing body, existing in several countries of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries. In Portugal, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau and Timor-Leste, a c√¢mara municipal is the executive body of a municipality. In Brazil, it is the legislature of a municipality. S√£o Tome and Pr√≠ncipe has similar c√¢maras distritais (district chambers), which are the executive bodies of the districts (municipalities). In all these countries, the members of a c√¢mara are known as vereadores (aldermen).  Brazil  The Brazilian c√¢maras municipais have their origin in the municipal administration model inherited from Portugal. However, while the Portuguese c√¢maras evolved towards becoming executive bodies, in Brazil they evolved towards becoming the legislative bodies of the municipalities. In Brazil, the executive municipal power is vested in the prefeituras municipais (municipal prefectures), each headed by the prefeito (mayor). Each c√¢mara municipal is composed of a number of elected vereadores.  Portugal  Its members (vereadores, aldermen) are elected by the Hondt method, serve year-round and are paid. The president of a Municipal Chamber is the head of the most-voted list. The C√¢mara Municipal has an odd number of aldermen (from five to thirteen), determined by the number of registered voters within the municipality, with the exceptions of Lisbon (fixed at 17 aldermen) and Porto (15 aldermen). Each Municipal Chamber has a council, composed of representatives from a variety of organizations, which serve as a consultative body. . The term can also refer to the building where the Municipal Chamber offices are located, i.e., the City Hall. A C√¢mara municipal is an executive body of a municipal, a level higher than the Junta de freguesia. The legislature equivalent of C√¢mara municipal is the Assembleia Municipal.

Konx Om Pax: Essays in Light is a publication by British occultist Aleister Crowley, first published in 1907. The title, Konx Om Pax, is a phrase said to have been pronounced in the Eleusinian Mysteries to bid initiates to depart after having completed the tests for admission to the degree of epopt (seer). The origin and meaning of this phrase are obscure, although numerous theories have been proposed. S. L. MacGregor Mathers claimed the phrase was derived from Khabs-am Pekht, which in the Egyptian language means roughly \\"light in extension\\" or \\"light rushing out in a single ray\\", which is used in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn's Vernal and Autumnal Equinox ceremonies. This is the meaning which Crowley ascribes to the phrase within the book. The front cover image, portraying the title Konx Om Pax in stretched letters, is said to have been designed by Crowley while smoking hashish.  Contents  = Introduction = Syncretic materials introduce the work: * Ave: in John Dee and Edward Kelley's Enochian language; * the Egyptian hieroglyphs for the Stele of Ankh-f-n-khonsu Three full pages of quotations introduce this work, signaling the syncretic intention of the author.Gordan Djurdjevic. The Great Beast as a Tantric Hero, collected in Aleister Crowley and Western Esotericism, ed. Henrik Bogdan, Martin P. Starr Many sacred texts and sources such as Dante, Catullus, and Jesus are quoted. = The Wake World = An allegory for the ascent of a magickal practitioner through the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, accompanied by her Holy Guardian Angel. It was originally written by Crowley as a bedtime story for his daughter, Lola Zaza, with Crowley relating himself as the \\"Fairy Prince\\", a guide through the schema and sounding much like Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. = Thien Tao, or, the Synagogue of Satan = This parodic essay casts a Crowley character (Master Kwaw) as a Taoist advisor to the Japanese \\"Daimio\\" (daimy≈ç) in a time of crisis. Kwaw advises a course of study in which people shall be taught the antithesis of their natural tendencies: the prostitute to learn chastity, the prude to learn sexual expression, the religious bigot to learn Huxley's materialism, the atheist to learn ceremonial magick. = Ali Sloper, or, the Forty Liars: A Christmas Diversion = A play that is over-presented with title credits, but is generally a simple dialogue based on Crowley's conversation with a friend and his wife on Christmas Day. With only two main speakers Crowley satyrizes himself as \\"Bowley\\", with the whole a means to present his inserted essay Ameth. The title is a mock of Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves, a tale from the classic One Thousand and One Nights. = Stone of the Philosophers Which Is Hidden in the Mountain of Abiegnus = A satirical conversation between a number of men, including \\"a socialist\\" and \\"a doctor\\", each one contributing a poem into their philosophical debate. Here Crowley takes the stance as \\"Basil Gray\\"; the work contains La Gitana, his popular love poem. It is thought that this work was inspired by the Zohar, where each Rabbi would contribute a commentary on the Tanakh. Editions *Yoga Publication Society. June 1982. *Teitan Press.

It is about north of Salt Lake City. The base was named in honor of Major Ployer Peter Hill of the U.S. Army Air Corps, who died test-flying NX13372, the original Model 299 prototype of the B-17 Flying Fortress bomber. As of 2018 Hill AFB is the sixth-largest employer in the state of Utah. Hill AFB is the home of the Air Force Materiel Command's (AFMC) Ogden Air Logistics Complex which is the worldwide manager for a wide range of aircraft, engines, missiles, software, avionics, and accessories components. The commander of the Air Logistics Complex is Brigadier General H. Brent Baker Sr. The Ogden Air Logistics Complex is part of the Air Force Sustainment Center. The host unit at Hill AFB is the Air Force Material Command's 75th Air Base Wing (75 ABW), which provides services and support for the Ogden Air Logistics Complex and its subordinate organizations. The Wing and Installation Commander of Hill Air Force Base is Colonel Jon A. Eberlan. Additional tenant units at Hill AFB include operational fighter wings of the Air Combat Command (ACC) and the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). History Hill Air Force Base is named in honor of Major Ployer Peter Hill (1894‚Äì1935), the Chief of the Flying Branch of the U.S. Army Air Corps Material Division of Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio. Major Hill had died as a result of injuries he received from the crash of the Boeing Aircraft Company's experimental aircraft Boeing Model 299 at Wright Field, the prototype airplane for what became the famous B-17 Flying Fortress. Hill Air Force Base traces its origins back to the ill- fated U.S. Army's Air Mail \\"experiment\\" of 1934, when the idea originated for a permanent air depot in the Salt Lake City area. In the following years, the U.S. Army Air Corps surveyed the region for a suitable location for the permanent western terminus of the air mail. Several sites in Utah were considered, and the present site near Ogden emerged as the clear favorite. In July 1939, Congress appropriated $8.0 million for the establishment and construction of the Ogden Air Depot. Hill Field officially opened on 7 November 1940. Following American entry into World War II in December 1941, Hill Field quickly became an important maintenance and supply base, with round-the-clock operations geared to supporting the war effort. Battle-worn warplanes like the A-26, B-17, B-24, B-29, P-40, P-47, P-61, were sent to Hill Field for structural repairs, engine overhauls, and spare parts. The peak wartime employment at Hill Field was reached in 1943 with a total of just over 22,000 military and civilian personnel. Men and women at the depot rehabilitated and returned thousands of warplanes to combat. Starting in 1944, Hill Field was utilized for the long-term storage of surplus airplanes and their support equipment, including outmoded P-40 Tomahawks and P-40 Warhawks which had been removed from combat service and replaced by newer and better warplanes. P-47 Thunderbolts, B-24 Liberators, B-29 Superfortresses, and many other types of aircraft were also prepared for and placed in storage at Hill over the course of the 1940s and 1950s. Hill Field became the Hill Air Force Base on 5 February 1948, following the creation of the United States Air Force. During the Korean War, Hill AFB was assigned a major share of the Air Materiel Command's logistical effort to support the combat in Korea. Hill AFB personnel quickly removed needed warplanes from storage, renovated them, and added them to active-service USAF flying squadrons.Hangar at Hill Air Force Base. Then during the 1960s, Hill AFB began to perform the maintenance support for various kinds of jet warplanes, mainly the F-4 Phantom II during the Vietnam War, and then afterwards, the more modern F-16 Fighting Falcons, A-10 Thunderbolt IIs, and C-130 Hercules, and also air combat missile systems and air-to-ground rockets. Hill AFB continues to carry out these tasks to the present day. =Major commands assigned= * Materiel Div, Office of Chief of the Air Corps, 1 December 1939 ‚Äì 11 December 1941 *Air Service Command, 11 December 1941 ‚Äì 17 July 1944 * AAF Materiel and Services, 17 July 1944 ‚Äì 31 August 1944 *Army Air Forces Technical Service Command, 31 August 1944 ‚Äì 1 July 1945 *Air Technical Service Command, 1 July 1945 ‚Äì 9 March 1946 *Air Materiel Command, 9 March 1946 ‚Äì 1 April 1961 *Air Force Logistics Command, 1 April 1961 ‚Äì 1 June 1992 *Air Force Materiel Command 1 June 1992 ‚Äì present =Base operating units= * Ogden Air Depot, 7 November 1940 ‚Äì 8 April 1942 * 9th Station Complement, 8 April 1942 ‚Äì 2 January 1943 * 482d Base HQ and Air Base Sq, 2 January 1943 ‚Äì 1 April 1944 * 4135th AAF Base Unit, 1 April 1944 ‚Äì 26 September 1947 * 4135th AF Base Unit, 26 September 1947 ‚Äì 27 August 1948 * HQ and HQ Sq, Ogden AMA, 27 August 1948 ‚Äì 4 May 1950 * 25th Air Base Gp, 4 May 1950 ‚Äì 1 May 1953 * 2849th Air Base Wg, 1 May 1953 ‚Äì 8 July 1964 * 2849th Air Base Gp, 8 July 1964 ‚Äì 1994 * 75th Air Base Wing 1994 ‚Äì present  Role and operations  = Ogden Air Logistics Complex = The Ogden Air Logistics Complex provides worldwide engineering and logistics management for the F-35 Lightning II, F-16 Fighting Falcon, A-10 Thunderbolt II, and Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile. = 75th Air Base Wing = The 75th Air Base Wing is responsible for the base operating support of all units at Hill AFB.

The term \\"settlement\\" also has other meanings in the context of law. Structured settlements provide for future periodic payments, instead of a one time cash payment. Basis A settlement, as well as dealing with the dispute between the parties is a contract between those parties, and is one possible (and common) result when parties sue (or contemplate so doing) each other in civil proceedings. The plaintiffs and defendants identified in the lawsuit can end the dispute between themselves without a trial. The contract is based upon the bargain that a party forgoes its ability to sue (if it has not sued already), or to continue with the claim (if the plaintiff has sued), in return for the certainty written into the settlement. The courts will enforce the settlement. If it is breached, the party in default could be sued for breach of that contract. In some jurisdictions, the party in default could also face the original action being restored. The settlement of the lawsuit defines legal requirements of the parties and is often put in force by an order of the court after a joint stipulation by the parties. In other situations (as where the claims have been satisfied by the payment of a certain sum of money), the plaintiff and defendant can simply file a notice that the case has been dismissed. The majority of cases are decided by a settlement. Both sides (regardless of relative monetary resources) often have a strong incentive to settle to avoid the costs (such as legal fees, finding expert witnesses, etc.), the time and the stress associated with a trial, particularly where a trial by jury is available. Generally, one side or the other will make a settlement offer early in litigation. The parties may hold (and indeed, the court may require) a settlement conference, at which they attempt to reach such a settlement. In controversial cases, it may be written into a settlement that both sides keep its contents and all other information relevant to the case confidential or that one of the parties (usually the one being sued) does not, by agreeing to the settlement, admit to any fault or wrongdoing in the underlying issue. A \\"global settlement\\" is one employed where suits have been filed or charges brought in multiple jurisdictions and is defined as \\"a legal agreement that addresses or compromises both civil claims and criminal charges against a corporation or other large entity\\".questions.com Examples of a global settlement include the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement between the attorneys general of 46 U.S. states and the four major U.S. tobacco companies in 1999.Global Settlement of Tobacco Litigation: Hearing Before the Commerce, Science, and Transportation, U.S. Senate (U.S. Government Printing Office, 1997) Another example is within the Global Analyst Research Settlements. Specific jurisdictions =United States= Usually, lawsuits end in a settlement, with an empirical analysis finding that less than 2% of cases end with a trial, 90% of torts settle, and around 50% of other civil cases settle.  Negotiations  Under Federal Rule of Evidence 408, settlement negotiations cannot usually be introduced as evidence at trial, and many state rules of evidence have similar rules modeled after it. Confidentiality  Most settlements are confidential. In these cases, the court order may refer to another document which is not disclosed, but which may be revealed to prove a breach of the settlement. Confidentiality is not possible in class action cases in the United States, where all settlements are subject to approval by the court pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and counterpart rules adopted in most states. In some cases, confidential settlements are requested in discovery. Federal courts can issue protective orders preventing the release, but the party seeking to prevent disclosure must show that harm or prejudice would result from the disclosure. In specific states such as California, however the burden is on the party seeking release of the confidential settlement. Limitations The confidentiality of settlements is controversial as it allows damaging actions to remain secret, as occurred in the Catholic sexual abuse scandal. In response, some states have passed laws which limit confidentiality. For example, in 1990 Florida passed a 'Sunshine in Litigation' law which limits confidentiality from concealing public hazards. Washington state, Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana have laws limiting confidentiality as well, although judicial interpretation has weakened the application of these types of laws. In the U.S. Congress, a similar federal Sunshine in Litigation Act has been proposed but not passed in 2009, 2011, 2014, and 2015. Confidentiality agreements which keep secrets from regulators about violations is probably unenforceable, but a specific carveout granting regulators access is usually not included. =England and Wales= In England and Wales, if the matter is already before the courts, except in a case where the claim is to be dismissed outright and the Claimant agrees to pay the Defendant's costs, the matter is usually dealt with by a consent order, signed by the legal representatives of both parties and approved by the judge. To get around the issue of confidentiality referred to above, a standard procedure consent order, known as a Tomlin Order is entered into. The order itself contains an agreement that the claim is stayed and no further action can be taken in court (except for referring a dispute in the implementation of the order to court, which is allowed). The order also deals with payment of costs, and payments of money out of court if any money is held by the court (as these are matters which must be dealt with by Court Order). However, the actual terms of the settlement are dealt with in a 'schedule' to the order, which can remain confidential. Breach of the schedule can be dealt with as breach of contract, or breach of the consent order. = Israel = In Israel, which is a common law jurisdiction, settlements almost always are submitted to the court, for two reasons: (a) only by submitting the settlement to the court can the litigants control whether the court will order one or more parties to pay costs, and (b) the plaintiff (claimant) usually prefers for the settlement to be given the effect of a judgment. Criminal cases In criminal matters, the closest parallel to a settlement is a plea bargain, although this differs in several important respects, particularly the ability of the presiding judge to reject the terms of a settlement.

A distinguished soldier in a generation of exceptionally capable military and naval personnel, he served in the Seven Years' War of 1756-1763, taking part in the defeat of France. He later served in the American War of Independence (1775‚Äì1783) and in the early campaigns against France during the French Revolutionary War. Following the Battle of Paoli in Pennsylvania in 1777 he became known as \\"No-flint Grey\\" for, reputedly, ordering his men to extract the flints from their muskets during a night approach and to fight with the bayonet only.  Early life  He was the fourth son of Sir Henry Grey, 1st Baronet, of Howick and Hannah, daughter of Thomas Wood of Fallodon in Northumberland. Grey was born at his family's estate, known as Howick, 30 miles north of Newcastle upon Tyne and one mile from the North Sea. His exact birthdate is unknown, but he was baptized 23 October 1729, so he was probably born in October. Because he had three older brothers, Grey did not expect to inherit his father's titles and estates, so he pursued a career in the military. Two older brothers Sir Henry and Thomas both died without issue.  Military career  In 1744, with financial assistance from his father, Grey purchased a commission as an ensign in the 6th Regiment of Foot. He soon went to Scotland with the Sixth Regiment to suppress the Jacobite Rising of 1745. Following victory there, the Sixth Regiment spent the next few years in Gibraltar. In December 1752, he purchased a lieutenancy in the Sixth Regiment. In March 1755, he formed a new independent company and became their captain. Two months later, he purchased a captaincy in the 20th Regiment of Foot (subsequently titled 'East Devonshire Regiment', and in 1881 the Lancashire Fusiliers), in which James Wolfe served as lieutenant colonel. In 1757, while with Wolfe's regiment, he participated in the unsuccessful attack on Rochefort. = Seven Years' War = In the Seven Years' War, he served as adjutant in the staff of Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick and on 1 August 1759 was wounded at Minden. On 14 October 1760 he commanded a Light Company at the Battle of Campen, where he was again wounded. One year later, as Lt. Colonel of the 98th Regiment of Foot (1761), he participated in the Capture of Belle √éle, off the coast of Brittany. Next, he served at the Battle of Havana in 1762. Later, he was on the staff of Wilhelm, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe during the Spanish invasion of Portugal (1762). In 1763 he retired on half-pay, but in 1772 he received a promotion to Colonel and served as aide-de-camp to King George III. = American War of Independence = During the American War of Independence he was one of the more successful army leaders. He was rapidly promoted, becoming a Major General in 1777 and commanded the 3rd Brigade at the Battle of Brandywine. He earned the nickname \\"No-flint Grey\\" after the Battle of Paoli in the same campaign when, to ensure surprise in the night attack on an American encampment, it was said he ordered the infantry of his command to remove the flints from their muskets and use only their bayonets. In fact, he only directed that muskets should be unloaded. He commanded the 3rd Brigade again at the Battle of Germantown and the Battle of Monmouth. Immediately following his disastrous retreat at the Battle of Monmouth the American General Charles Lee excused himself from criticism by complaining that he had directly faced the advance Grey's 3rd brigade. Suggesting the Earl was a feared and respected opponent by this stage in the war. In 1778 he led raids at New Bedford on 5‚Äì6 September, destroying nearly all the shipping and burning twenty shops and twenty-two houses in the town, and Martha's Vineyard, where between 10 and 15 September, the British carried off all the sheep, swine, cattle and oxen that they could find with promise of payment in New York. On 27 September 1778, Grey used the same methods as he had at the Battle of Paoli in a controversial night attack at Old Tappan, New Jersey, which came to be known as the Baylor Massacre. He was recalled to England and became a knight of the Order of the Bath and a lieutenant general. He later was appointed commander-in-chief of the British troops in America, but hostilities ended before he could take command. = French Revolutionary Wars = At the outset of the war with Revolutionary France, in 1793, Sir Charles Grey was appointed commander of the West Indian expedition. First, however, he went to Ostend to participate in the relief of Nieuwpoort, Belgium. In early 1794, he and Admiral Sir John Jervis led a British force to capture Martinique. The campaign lasted about six weeks with the British capturing Fort Royal and Fort Saint Louis on 22 March, and Fort Bourbon two days later. The British then occupied Martinique until the Treaty of Amiens returned the island to the French in 1802. Next Grey was involved in the invasion of Guadeloupe. Between the years of 1797 and 1807 General Grey held the position of Governor of Guernsey, in the Channel Islands.  Peerage  In late 1794 he returned to England. From 1798 to 1799 he served as Commander of the Southern District, retiring in 1799. In acknowledgment of his service, he was raised in January 1801 to the peerage as Baron Grey, of Howick in the County of Northumberland. In 1806, he was created Earl Grey and Viscount Howick, in the County of Northumberland. He died the next year, at the age of 78.  Family  A member of the House of Grey, he married Elizabeth Grey (1744‚Äì1822), daughter of George Grey of Southwick (1713‚Äì1746). Their children were: * Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, (1764‚Äì1845) British statesman and prime minister after whom Earl Grey tea is named. Married Mary Elizabeth Ponsonby, and ancestor of later Earls Grey. * Sir George Grey, 1st Baronet of Fallodon, KCB (1767‚Äì1828), Flag Captain under Admiral Jervis, Flag Captain of King George III's Royal Yacht (1801‚Äì04), married Mary Whitbread, daughter of Samuel Whitbread (1720‚Äì1796). * Bishop Edward Grey (1782‚Äì1837) Bishop of Hereford married firstly Charlotte Elizabeth Croft, secondly Elizabeth Adair, and thirdly Eliza Innes. * Sir Henry George Grey, (1766‚Äì1845) GCH GCB, Colonel in the 13th Light Dragoons, who married Charlotte Des Voeux (1789‚Äì1882). * Lady Elizabeth Grey (1765‚Äì1846) married Samuel Whitbread. * Lt. Col. William Grey (1777‚Äì1817) married Maria Shirreff. * Lady Hannah Althea Grey (1785‚Äì1832) married George Edmund Byron Bettesworth. Grey and his wife brought up Eliza Courtney, the illegitimate daughter of their son Charles with Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire.

It is a tributary of the Little Tennessee River (and in turn the Tennessee River, Ohio River and Mississippi River), into which it flows near the county seat of Franklin. It originates to the southeast, near Highlands, the county's only other town. It flows from manmade Lake Sequoyah, which is fed by Mirror Lake and other creeks and streams originating on the western side of the Eastern Continental Divide, which runs through the east side of Highlands. A two-lane highway called Mountain Waters Scenic Byway, which is the combined route of U.S. 64 and NC 28, runs through the Cullasaja Gorge, which is mostly protected as part of the Nantahala National Forest. The U.S. Forest Service has designated this to be a National Scenic Byway because of the river, and its numerous waterfalls, including: *Bridal Veil Falls, actually from a tributary creek *Dry Falls, which visitors can walk behind without getting wet *Quarry Falls, also known as Bust-Yer-Butt Falls *Cullasaja Falls, the major cascade of falls The road is known as Franklin Road near Highlands, and Highlands Road near Franklin.

The most well-known is Peek's Creek, where a catastrophic flood and mudslide occurred in September 2004. Several former Cherokee towns were located along the Cullasaja River. The town of Ellijay was on Ellijay Creek, a tributary of Cullasaja River. Several Cherokee towns were called Kulsetsiyi (or Sugartown), abbreviated Kulsetsi, including one on Cullasaja River near Ellijay Creek. \\"Cullasaja\\" is a variant spelling of the Cherokee town name \\"Kulsetsi\\".

Brynmawr (; , ,Note: the name is preferably spelt in Welsh with a hyphen Bryn-mawr, according to the recommendations in Rhestr o Enwau Lleoedd (\\"A Gazetteer of Welsh Place-Names\\") by Elwyn Davies, University of Wales Press, 1967) is a market town, community and electoral ward in Blaenau Gwent, Wales. The town, sometimes cited as the highest town in Wales, is situated at above sea level at the head of the South Wales Valleys. It grew with the development of the coal mining and iron industries in the early 19th century. Until the reorganisation of local authorities in 1974, Brynmawr was administered as part of the county of Brecknockshire. History Prior to the Industrial Revolution Brynmawr was a small village settlement called Gwaun Helygen (Cors Helygen in Modern Welsh, meaning \\"marsh of the willow\\" in English) in the county of Brecknockshire. With the expansion of the Nantyglo Ironworks housing was required for the workers and Brynmawr turned into a prosperous town. Although coal mining has virtually ceased, a large mining museum has been established at Big Pit in nearby Blaenavon. Population Brynmawr has an estimated population of over 6,000 people. At the 2001 Census 5.75% of the 16‚Äì65 age group spoke Welsh, but the proportion of children (ages 3‚Äì15) able to speak Welsh was much higher at 30.54%. The town had the only Welsh-medium primary school, Ysgol Gymraeg Brynmawr, in Blaenau Gwent with 310 pupils ranging from nursery to year 6 until 2010, when the school re-located to a brand new, purpose-built building in Blaina. Commerce and local economy The town centre's primary shopping areas are contained within Beaufort Street and on Market Square which is also the focal point of the town where many events are hosted. The former Market Hall is now a cinema and theatre presenting films and productions from the local amateur operatic society. The business community offers many traditional, family-orientated and independently run shops, such as Tutta Bella, Durbans Shoe repairs, Perfectday Bridal and many more. The Tabor Centre, situated in Davies Street, is a multi-purpose community venue with rooms available for hire. Brynmawr is also home to many artisan food producers, such as the award-winning Miss Daisy's Kitchen, specialist vegan and gluten-free food producers Daddies Little Pickle, and the Little Dragon Pizza Van, who organise the annual Brynmawr Street Food Festival. Places of interest Parc Nant y Waun is a nature reserve incorporating of grassland, mires and reservoirs which was officially opened in 2007.Opening of Parc Nant y Waun Home to many wildlife species, it includes a picnic area, an outdoor classroom, and an angling club.Angling Club Sport and leisure Heavy frost at the park, December 2008 Brynmawr RFC is the local rugby union club which is affiliated to the Newport Gwent Dragons. Brynmawr has a 350-seat cinema (The Market Hall Cinema) which is the longest continually running cinema in Wales. The Market Hall opened in 1893 and has recently been renovated. As of 1 April 2017 the Market Hall Cinema has been closed since November 2016 after Blaenau Gwent Council conducted a series of asbestos tests in the building. The Market Hall was successfully reopened by Hollywood star Michael Sheen on 12 July 2017.

Wales and Great Britain Rugby League international Roy Francis, who scored 229 tries in 356 top-flight matches and went on to win three National League titles and the 1968 Challenge Cup as a coach of Hull FC and Leeds, was born in the town and played for Brynmawr RFC.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRX27awOb6g See also  * References External links * Brynmawr Town Council website * Old photos of Brynmawr * Aerial photograph of Brynmawr * Photos of Brynmawr and surrounding area on geograph.org.uk * History of Brynmawr, Wales at thomasgenweb.com, with excerpts from Brynmawr: A Study of a Distressed Area, by Hilda Jennings Category:Towns in Blaenau Gwent Category:Market towns in Wales Category:Wards of Blaenau Gwent ","title":"Brynmawr"},{"id":"556350","title":"Ben Gordon"},{"id":"556357","title":"Maytag"},{"id":"556358","text":"Neoclassical cocklestove in the Palais Rohan (Strasbourg, France) A stove is a device in which fuel is burned to heat either the space in which the stove is situated, or items placed on the heated stove or inside it in an oven. There are many types of stoves, such as the kitchen stove, which is used to cook food, and the wood-burning stove or a coal stove, which is typically used for heating a dwelling. Due to concerns about air pollution, efforts have been made to improve the stove design over the years. Pellet stoves, for example, are a type of clean-burning stove, and air-tight stoves are another type that burn the wood more completely and therefore reduce the amount of the resulted combustion by-products. Another possibility is the addition of a device to clean the exhaust gas (e.g. filter or afterburner).Chimney filters can save billions All wood stoves manufactured In the United States since 1992 are required to limit emission of particulates.  Origin  The Old English word stofa meant any individual enclosed space, such as a room, and \\"stove\\" is still occasionally used in that sense, as in \\"stoved in\\". Until well into the 19th century \\"stove\\" was used to mean a single heated room, so that Joseph Banks' assertion that he \\"placed his most precious plants in the stove\\" or Ren√© Descartes' observation that he got \\"his greatest philosophical inspiration while sitting inside a stove\\" are not as odd as they first seem. In its earliest attestation, cooking was done by roasting meat and tubers in an open fire. Pottery and other cooking vessels may be placed directly on an open fire, but setting the vessel on a support, as simple as a base of three stones, resulted in a stove. The three-stone stove is still widely used around the world. In some areas it developed into a U-shaped dried mud or brick enclosure with the opening in the front for fuel and air, sometimes with a second smaller hole at the rear. Kitchen stove A kitchen stove, cooker, or cookstove is a kitchen appliance designed for the purpose of cooking food. Kitchen stoves rely on the application of direct heat for the cooking process and may also contain an oven underneath or to the side that is used for baking. Traditionally these have been fueled by wood, and one of the earliest recorded instances of a wood-burning kitchen stove was the so-called stew stove (developed in 1735 by the French designer Fran√ßois de Cuvilli√©s and officially termed the Castrol Stove). More modern versions such as the popular Rayburn range offer a choice between using wood or gas. Wood burning stove Coal stoves The most common stove for heating in the industrial world for almost a century and a half was the coal stove that burned coal. Coal stoves came in all sizes and shapes and different operating principles. Coal burns at a much higher temperature than wood, and coal stoves must be constructed to resist the high heat levels. A coal stove can burn either wood or coal, but a wood stove might not burn coal unless a grate is supplied. The grate may be removable or an \\"extra\\". This is because coal stoves are fitted with a grate so allowing part of the combustion air to be admitted below the fire. The proportion of air admitted above/below the fire depends on the type of coal. Brown coal and lignites evolve more combustible gases than say anthracite and so need more air above the fire. The ratio of air above/below the fire must be carefully adjusted to enable complete combustion.\\"Hand Firing With Coal\\" Popular Mechanics, December 1943 article gives a detailed description with drawings of various coal stoves for heating in general use in that era with methods of operation  Efficiency  Compared to simple open fires, enclosed stoves can offer greater efficiency and control. In free air, solid fuels burn at a temperature of only about , which is too low a temperature for perfect combustion reactions to occur, heat produced through convection is largely lost, smoke particles are evolved without being fully burned and the supply of combustion air cannot be readily controlled. By enclosing the fire in a chamber and connecting it to a chimney, draft (draught) is generated pulling fresh air through the burning fuel. This causes the temperature of combustion to rise to a point () where efficient combustion is achieved, the enclosure allows the ingress of air to be regulated and losses by convection are almost eliminated. It also becomes possible, with ingenious design, to direct the flow of burned gasses inside the stove such that smoke particles are heated and destroyed. Enclosing a fire also prevents air from being sucked from the room into the chimney. This can represent a significant loss of heat as an open fireplace can pull away many cubic metres of heated air per hour. Efficiency is generally regarded as the maximum heat output of a stove or fire, and is usually referred to by manufacturers as the difference between heat to the room and heat lost up the chimney. An early improvement was the fire chamber: the fire was enclosed on three sides by masonry walls and covered by an iron plate. Only in 1735 did the first design that completely enclosed the fire appear: the Castrol stove of the French architect Fran√ßois de Cuvilli√©s was a masonry construction with several fireholes covered by perforated iron plates. It is also known as a stew stove. Near the end of the 18th century, the design was refined by hanging the pots in holes through the top iron plate, thus improving heat efficiency even more. In 1743, Benjamin Franklin invented an all-metal fireplace with an attempt to improve the efficiency. It was still an open-faced fireplace, but improved on efficiency compared to old-fashioned fireplaces. Some stoves use a catalytic converter, which causes combustion of the gas and smoke particles not previously burned. Other models use a design that includes firebox insulation, a large baffle to produce a longer, hotter gas flow path. Modern enclosed stoves are often built with a window to let out some light and to enable the user to view progress of the fire. While enclosed stoves are typically more efficient and controllable than open fires, there are exceptions. The type of water-heating \\"back boiler\\" open fires commonly used in Ireland, for instance, can achieve more than 80% absolute efficiency.  Material  Masonry heaters were developed to control air flow in stoves. A masonry heater is designed to allow complete combustion by burning fuels at full-temperature with no restriction of air inflow. Due to its large thermal mass the captured heat is radiated over long periods of time without the need of constant firing, and the surface temperature is generally not dangerous to touch. Metal stoves came into use in the 18th century. An early and famous example of a metal stove is the Franklin stove, said to have been invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1742. It had a labyrinthine path for hot exhaust gases to escape, thus allowing heat to enter the room instead of going up the chimney. The Franklin stove, however, was designed for heating, not for cooking. Benjamin Thompson at the turn to the 19th century was among the first to present a working metal kitchen stove. His Rumford fireplace used one fire to heat several pots that were also hung into holes so that they could be heated from the sides, too. It was even possible to regulate the heat individually for each hole. His stove was designed for large canteen or castle kitchens, though. It would take another 30 years until the technology had been refined and the size of the iron stove been reduced enough for domestic use. Philo Stewart's Oberlin stove was a much more compact, wood-burning cast-iron stove, patented in the United States in 1834. It became a huge commercial success with some 90,000 units sold in the next 30 years. In Europe, similar designs also appeared in the 1830s. In the following years, these iron stoves evolved into specialised cooking appliances with flue pipes connected to the chimney, oven holes, and installations for heating water. The originally open holes into which the pots were hung were now covered with concentric iron rings on which the pots were placed. Depending on the size of the pot or the heat needed, one could remove the inner rings.

The largest strides have been made in innovations for biomass burning stoves, such as the wood-burning stoves used in many of the most populous countries. These new designs address the fundamental problem that wood and other biomass fires inefficiently consume large amounts of fuel to produce relatively small amounts of heat, while producing fumes that cause significant indoorSee CRECER, Chronic Respiratory Effects of Early Childhood Exposure to Respirable Particulate Matter http://ehs.sph.berkeley.edu/guat/page.asp?id=07 and environmental pollutants. The World Health Organization has documented the significant number of deaths caused by smoke from home fires. Increases in efficiency mean that a stove's users can spend less time gathering wood or other fuels, suffer less emphysema and other lung diseases prevalent in smoke-filled homes, while reducing deforestation and air pollution. Corn and pellet stoves and furnaces are a type of biofuel stove. The shelled dry kernel of corn, also called a corn pellet, creates as much heat as a wood pellet, but generates more ash. \\"Corn pellet stoves and wood pellet stoves look the same from the outside. Since they are highly efficient, they don't need a chimney; instead, they can be vented outdoors by a four-inch (102 mm) pipe through an outside wall and so can be located in any room in the home.\\" A pellet stove is a type of clean- burning stove that uses small, biological fuel pellets which are renewable and very clean-burning. Home heating using a pellet stove is an alternative currently used throughout the world, with rapid growth in Europe. The pellets are made of renewable material ‚Äî typically wood sawdust or off-cuts. There are more than half a million homes in North America using pellet stoves for heat, and probably a similar number in Europe. The pellet stove typically uses a feed screw to transfer pellets from a storage hopper to a combustion chamber. Air is provided for the combustion by an electric blower. The ignition is automatic, using a stream of air heated by an electrical element. The rotation speed of the feeder and the fan speeds can be varied to modulate the heat output. Other efficient stoves are based on Top Lit updraft (T-LUD) or wood gas or smoke burner stove, a principle applied and made popular by Dr. Thomas Reed, which use small pieces of sticks, chips of wood or shavings, leaves, etc., as fuel. The efficiency is very high ‚Äî up to 50 percent ‚Äî as compared to traditional stoves that are 5 to 15 percent efficient on average. Stoves fueled by alcohol, such as ethanol, offer another modern, clean-burning stove option. Ethanol-fueled stoves have been made popular through the work of Project Gaia in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. =Air-tight stoves = The pentagonal self-cleaning wood stove, is an EPA style secondary combustion air wood stove with a fan forced heat exchanger, thermostat, outside air intake with throttle, shakers, and ash drop for easy cleanup. An air-tight stove is a wood-burning stove designed to burn solid fuel, traditionally wood, in a controlled fashion so as to provide for efficient and controlled fuel use, and the benefits of stable heating or cooking temperatures. They are made of sheet metal, consisting of a drum-like combustion chamber with airflow openings that can be open and shut, and a chimney of a metre or more length. These stoves are used most often to heat buildings in winter. Wood or other fuel is put into the stove, lit, and then air flow is regulated to control the burn. The intake airflow is either at the level where fuel is added, or below it. The exhaust (smoke) from the stove is usually several metres above the combustion chamber. Most modern air-tight stoves feature a damper at the stove's outlet that can be closed to force the exhaust through an after burner at the top of the stove, a heated chamber in which the combustion process continues. Some air-tight stoves feature a catalytic converter, a platinum grid placed at the stove outlet to burn remaining fuel that has not been combusted, as gases burn at a much lower temperature in the presence of platinum.Non-Catalytic Wood Stoves. United States Environmental Protection Agency. Accessed 2012-11-03Gird, John W. 1984 Catalytic Retrofits for Wood Stoves Cooperative Extension Service, University of Maryland, College Park. Accessed 2012-11-03 Using an air-tight stove initially requires leaving the damper and air vents open until a bed of coals has been formed. After that, the damper is closed and the air vent regulated to slow down the burning of the wood. A properly loaded and controlled air- tight stove will burn safely without further attention for eight hours, or longer. These features provide a more complete combustion of wood and elimination of polluting combustion products. It also provides for regulation of the intensity of fire by limiting air flow, and for the fire to create a strong draught or draw up the chimney. This results in highly efficient fuel usage. Air-tight stoves are a more sophisticated version of traditional wood- burning stoves.  Emission regulation  Many countries legislate to control emissions. Since 2015, the Phase III EPA Woodstove Regulations in the United States require that all wood stoves being manufactured limit particulate emission to 4.5 grams per hour for stoves with after burners or 2.5 grams per hour for stoves with catalytic converters. The burn temperature in modern stoves can increase to the point where secondary and complete combustion of the fuel takes place. A properly fired masonry heater has little or no particulate pollution in the exhaust and does not contribute to the buildup of creosote in the heater flues or the chimney. Some stoves achieve as little as 1 to 4 grams per hour. This is roughly 10% as much smoke than older stoves, and equates to nearly zero visible smoke from the chimney. This is largely achieved through causing the maximum amount of material to combust, which results in a net efficiency of 60 to 70%, as contrasted to less than 30% for an open fireplace. Net efficiency is defined as the amount of heat energy transferred to the room compared to the amount contained in the wood, minus any amount central heating must work to compensate for airflow problems. Stove research and development The search for safer, cleaner stoves remains to many an important if low-profile area of modern technology. Cook stoves in common use around the world, particularly in Third World countries, are considered fire hazards and worse: according to the World Health Organization, a million and a half people die each year from indoor smoke inhalation caused by faulty stoves. An engineer's \\"Stove Camp\\" has been hosted annually since 1999 by Aprovecho Research Center (Oregon, US) with the intent of designing a cheap, efficient, and healthy cook stove for use around the world. Other engineering societies (see Envirofit International, Colorado, US) and philanthropic groups (see the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, California) continue to research and promote improved cook stove designs. A focus on research and development on improved heating stoves is ongoing and was on display at the 2013 Wood Stove Decathlon in Washington, D.C.

It is the highest of the Yorkshire Three Peaks, the other two being Ingleborough and Pen-y-ghent. It is the highest point in the ceremonial county of North YorkshireMickle Fell in southern Teesdale is the highest point within the boundaries of the historic county of Yorkshire. and the historic West Riding of Yorkshire with the summit lying on the county boundary with Cumbria. In shape Whernside forms a long ridge, running roughly north-north-east to south- south-west. The mountain is north west of Ingleton and north of Horton-in- Ribblesdale. Routes There is a right of way footpath running from the east at Ribblehead that heads north via Smithy Hill and Grain Ings before turning west to Knoutberry Haw and then south to Whernside itself. From the summit the right of way heads initially south, then steeply southeast down a stepped path to the area known as Bruntscar. If climbed as part of the Yorkshire Three Peaks Challenge (which is normally done anti-clockwise) Whernside will be climbed following the route up from Ribblehead to descend to Bruntscar. There are, however, other routes up/down the mountain which are not rights of way. A path heads directly west from the triangulation pillar to reach the road that is Deepdale Lane near White Shaw Moss. An alternative route heads directly north across Knoutberry Haw to pass Whernside Tarns and reaches the Craven Way at Boot of the Wold. Following the southern descent for , instead of turning steeply southeast towards Bruntscar a path continues south running adjacent the wall passing Combe Scar and West Fell to reach the limestone pavements at Ewe's Top. Finally, south of the triangulation pillar an old route (partly fenced off) descends (initially very steeply) for to reach a road southwest of Winterscales Farm, this is the old route of the Three Peaks Challenge. Walkers should select this route with care as it is no longer maintained, boggy, badly eroded and requires extreme care over the steep ascent/descent. The current route of the Three Peaks fell race runs approximately north of this old ascent along open moor. All paths are on open access land and make an interesting change from the right of way ascents/descents. A walk solely around Whernside starting at the junction of the Blea Moor and Gauber roads near the Station Inn at Ribblehead, to the top of Whernside and back via the bridleway from Bruntscar via the farms at Broadrake, Ivescar, Winterscales and Gunnerfleet (or the footpath from Blea Moor Sidings) is a distance of roughly . Alfred Wainwright in his 1970 Walks in Limestone Country describes three walks titled \\"Ascent of Whernside\\": a route from Ingleton, up the south west ridge and returning via Ellerbeck, which he describes as \\"an exhilirating walk, a tonic for jaded minds, and a splendid exercise for the legs\\"; a route from Dent (or from a car parked nearer), following what is now the Dales High Way route onto the ridge and descending steeply west to Deepdale, \\"a fine walk on a fine day with excellent views ... the best of all routes up Whernside because of the lovely countryside from which it springs\\"; and the ascent from Ribblehead, via Force Gill with a direct return via Winterscales. General On a clear day the views from the summit to the west can be spectacular, with views of the Lake District and Morecambe Bay, including (with the aid of binoculars) Blackpool Tower, some away. Whernside lies about northwest of Ribblehead Viaduct on the Settle‚ÄìCarlisle Railway. Whernside is sometimes confused with the lower peak of Great Whernside away to the east of Whernside. The word \\"Whern\\" is believed to refer to querns (millstones) whilst \\"side\\" is derived from the Norse \\"s√¶ttr\\", meaning an area of summer pasture.

They were founded by Anselmo parallel to his membership in Pantera, but became a full-time endeavor a few years later after Pantera's dissolution. Their style can be considered a mix of Pantera's style of groove metal and thrash metal. A small trace of black metal can be heard, as well. Bands like Venom, Slayer, Celtic Frost, Voivod, and Darkthrone have been noted as influences also. The name Superjoint Ritual comes from a lyric in the Darkthrone song \\"The Pagan Winter\\". According to Bower, Anselmo wrote 70-80% of the group's music. Despite their early 1990s establishment, it was not until a decade later, after the folding of Pantera, that the group recorded any albums. It was then that Superjoint Ritual garnered significant TV exposure on programs such as MTV2's Headbangers Ball and Fuse TV's Uranium. However, the group's time in the spotlight would prove short lived. A dispute between Anselmo and Fazzio led to the band's eventual split in late 2004, which was confirmed by both Hank Williams III and Jimmy Bower. The band reunited at the Housecore Horror Film Festival in Austin, Texas in October, 2014. For legal reasons, the band performed under the name Superjoint. Hank Williams III was initially supposed to take part in this first reunion show, but had to bow out due to personal issues. Although their appearance at Housecore Horror was supposed to be the only reunion show, the band would later perform at Hellfest Open Air 2015. Superjoint released Caught Up in the Gears of Application on November 11, 2016 through Housecore Records. In January 2017, Superjoint played a tour with Battlecross and Child Bite. In an interview in June 2019, Anselmo mentioned that he was no longer interested in playing with Superjoint, once again ending the band.

It is one of the Yorkshire Three Peaks (the other two being Whernside and Pen-y-ghent), and is frequently climbed as part of the Three Peaks walk. Name The first element of the name \\"Ingleborough\\" has been variably explained as a Scots term for 'beacon, fire', an Old Danish term meaning 'English' or a derivative of Old English ing, 'peak'. The second element is derived from the Old English word burh, meaning \\"a fortified place\\"; in this case, a hill fort. The summit plateau of Ingleborough is encircled by the remains of a massive stone rampart, containing the foundations of Iron Age huts. Geography Ingleborough is in the south-western corner of the Yorkshire Dales, at the highest point of a triangle of land with corners at Ingleton, Ribblehead and Settle. The hill is connected to its nearest higher neighbour, Whernside, by a low col or mountain pass at Ribblehead at approximately . Ingleborough throws out a ridge to the north-east which develops into a summit, Simon Fell, and another summit further down, Park Fell. An ill-defined ridge going south-east from the summit breaks into two large areas of limestone plateau at about ; both plateaux contain summits and these are the subsidiary summits of Norber and Moughton. On the slopes of the former are the famed Norber Boulders. Continuing south-east the high land is broken by a divide carrying the minor road from Austwick to Helwith Bridge. On the other side of the divide the low summit of Smearsett Scar rises along with its subsidiaries, Pot Scar and Giggleswick Scar; from here the land falls away to the River Ribble at Settle. On the western side of Ingleborough is a large limestone plateau appropriately known as White Scars. White Scar Caves run for below the plateau, and their entrance series has been developed as a show cave. The plateau is bounded by Raven Scar, the longest unbroken cliff in the district, and on top of it is the pothole of Meregill Hole. On the southern side (west of the Clapham path) is a similar plateau, containing potholes such as Fluted Hole and Pillar Hole. The unassuming but cavernous Juniper Gulf The plateau to the north of Norber, an area known as The Allotment, is particularly rich in potholes; one of these, Long Kin East, can be followed without specialist caving equipment for . Also here is Juniper Gulf, which descends underground through an arduous rift, dominated by a small geological fault. The Smearsett Scar region contains the Celtic Wall, the Ebbing and Flowing Well (which has now stopped ebbing and flowing) and a glacial hollow known as the Happy Valley. Ascents There are several popular hillwalking routes to its summit. The most frequently used starting point is probably the village of Ingleton, about to the southwest. An ascent from here is about there and back. The route follows a walled lane, Fell Lane, before emerging onto a flat area, Crina Bottom, scattered with potholes including the considerable Quaking Pot. A steep climb through the limestone cliffs leads to the summit. The hill may also be climbed from Horton in Ribblesdale to the east, following a route crossing extensive areas of limestone pavement in the region of Sulber Nick. This is the route of descent of the Three Peaks Walk and has been heavily improved by the National Trust, having changed in just thirty years from no path at all to a serious example of footpath erosion. Another route on this flank is from the isolated farmstead of Crummack. There is also a route from Clapham that follows the Ingleborough Estate nature trail, before passing the Craven Fault, the showcave of Ingleborough Cave, the ravine of Trow Gill and the pothole of Gaping Gill. It then crosses a marshy area and climbs up to the shoulder of Little Ingleborough before following the ridge to the summit. The return to Clapham can be varied by taking the Horton- in-Ribblesdale path for before striking south through more limestone pavement to the small top of Norber; a descent past the famed Norber erratics (Norber Boulders) finishes a walk of that Wainwright considered the finest walk in the Yorkshire Dales. An alternative route from the south-west side of the triangle starts at Newby Cote, roughly a mile northwest of Clapham on the minor road heading towards Ingleton. This path proceeds ENE until it joins the main path from Clapham about a mile from the summit. There is a northern route from the Hill Inn at Chapel-le-Dale, the route of ascent used by the Three Peaks Walk and the shortest way up the mountain, being just from village to summit. An interesting walk across a limestone plateau with many caves, including Great Douk Cave and Meregill Hole, is followed by a steep and tedious climb to the shoulder of the subsidiary summit of Simon Fell at , a mile to the north-east of the summit. The passage from here to the summit is high-level and exhilarating, but requires some scrambling. Finally there are unwaymarked routes heading NE across Simon Fell and Souther Scales Fell both of which reach a steep descent just beyond the triangulation pillar on Park Fell to reach the Right of Way at New Close. Both routes give commanding views of the area. The summit trig point and windshelter The layered appearance of Ingleborough View from the limestone pavement Twistleton Scar, west of Ingleborough The summit is a broad plateau half a mile in circumference, slightly convex, higher to the north-west than to the south-east, and carpeted with dry turf. There is an Ordnance Survey trig point (number S. 5619) at the highest point, near the western corner. Just to the north is a well-built windshelter (cross-shaped to provide shelter whichever way the wind is blowing) with a view indicator or toposcope built into its centre. Between them is a large cairn. At the point where the Ingleton path reaches the summit rim is an even larger cairn; this, remarkably, is the remains of a battlemented round tower (a hospice), built in 1830. The celebrations on the day of its opening ceremony became so alcoholic, however, that parts of it were thrown down there and then, the rest being destroyed later. Along the northern and eastern edges of the plateau are the tumbled remains of a wall, once believed to have been a Roman military camp but now known to be an Iron Age hill fort. For the view, which is far-reaching and superb, see here. The hill fort, which covers and of which the defensive wall can still be seen although much robbed for stone, contains the remains of several hut circles. It is now thought that this was in fact Celtic, built by the Brigantes, the largest amalgamation of tribes in Iron Age Britain. The fort was known to the Romans as the Kings Fort. It may be that this was a base for Venutius after his 'divorce' from Cartimandua, the Brigantes Queen who was a supporter of the Roman invaders, unlike Venutius who led several rebellions. What we do know is that this fort was used all year, which was unusual for such a location, but at the time of the Romans the climate was much milder, the Romans for example cultivating grapes in Newcastle. Geology The striking appearance of Ingleborough from all directions and from a great distance is due to the unusual geology of the underlying rock. The base of the mountain is composed of ancient Silurian and Ordovician rocks which are exposed in the valley bottoms to the north of Ingleton. A belt of Carboniferous Limestone, the 'Great Scar Limestone', some thick, lies on top of this. Due to the limestone's permeability, all the streams flowing down from the mountain are engulfed upon reaching it, falling into a number of potholes. Above lies the layered Yoredale Series of sedimentary rocks, predominantly shale and sandstone, and generally concealed by the peat but revealed in the escarpments about up. There are also layers of harder limestone sandwiched between the softer rocks which have been eroded faster, and which protect the layers beneath them, leading to the 'tiered' effect. The whole mountain, however, is protected from erosion by a cap of Millstone Grit approximately tall. The rock above the Millstone Grit layer has been eroded away, which explains the comparative flatness of the summit. A good explanation of the geology and scenery of the area is given in Waltham. The view Important mountain peaks visible from Ingleborough are listed here, clockwise from north, with their distance in miles and bearing in degrees. The furthest peak visible is Manod Mawr in Snowdonia, North Wales, away on a bearing of 218 degrees. =North to east= * Wild Boar Fell, 15 miles, 5 degrees * Mickle Fell, 31 miles, 7 degrees * High Seat, 17 miles, 12 degrees * Great Knoutberry Hill, 8 miles, 21 degrees * Great Shunner Fell, 16 miles, 26 degrees * Lovely Seat, 15 miles, 34 degrees * Dodd Fell Hill, 9 miles, 45 degrees * Yockenthwaite Moor, 11 miles, 69 degrees * Buckden Pike, 14 miles, 79 degrees * Plover Hill, 7 miles, 87 degrees =East to south= * Great Whernside, 16 miles, 92 degrees * Pen-y- ghent, 6 miles, 98 degrees * Fountains Fell, 8 miles, 105 degrees * Thorpe Fell Top, 19 miles, 119 degrees * Ilkley Moor, 30 miles, 128 degrees * Rye Loaf Hill, 10 miles, 132 degrees * Boulsworth Hill, 27 miles, 155 degrees * Kinder Scout, 58 miles, 159 degrees * Shining Tor, 65 miles, 166 degrees * Pendle Hill, 21 miles, 169 degrees =South to west= * Winter Hill, 38 miles, 188 degrees * White Hill, 11 miles, 203 degrees * Fair Snape Fell, 19 miles, 208 degrees * Moel Siabod, 99 miles, 221 degrees * Ward's Stone, 13 miles, 223 degrees * Carnedd Llewelyn, 95 miles, 224 degrees * Caton Moor, 12 miles, 236 degrees * Warton Crag, 15 miles, 266 degrees =West to north= * Snaefell, 84 miles, 275 degrees * Black Combe, 38 miles, 280 degrees * Old Man of Coniston, 33 miles, 296 degrees * Scafell Pike, 38 miles, 302 degrees * Great Gable, 40 miles, 304 degrees * Grasmoor, 45 miles, 309 degrees * Gragareth, 4¬Ω miles, 312 degrees * Helvellyn, 35 miles, 315 degrees * High Street, 29 miles, 321 degrees * Great Coum, 6 miles, 337 degrees * The Calf, 15 miles, 342 degrees * Yarlside, 15 miles, 347 degrees * Cross Fell, 37 miles, 355 degrees * Whernside, 4 miles, 359 degrees Gallery Image:Ingleborough.jpgIngleborough seen on the ascent of Simon Fell Image:Ingleborough.JPGIngleborough as seen from the summit of Whernside Image:Ingleborough mountain 02.JPGIngleborough ascent Image:Ingleborough Sept2015.jpgIngleborough from Little Ingleborough Image:IngleboroughSummit17Sept2015.jpgIngleborough Summit trig point References  External links  * Ingleborough National Nature Reserve * Three Peaks of Yorkshire * Routes to climb Ingleborough * Climb Ingleborough from Clapham Category:Marilyns of England Category:Hewitts of England Category:Peaks of the Yorkshire Dales Category:National nature reserves in England Category:Nuttalls Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in North Yorkshire Category:Yorkshire Three Peaks Category:Mountains and hills of the United Kingdom with toposcopes ","title":"Ingleborough"},{"id":"556371","text":"Pen-y-ghent or Penyghent is a fell in the Yorkshire Dales, England. It is the lowest of Yorkshire's Three Peaks at ; the other two being Ingleborough and Whernside. It lies east of Horton in Ribblesdale. It has a number of interesting geological features, such as Hunt Pot, and further down, Hull Pot. The waters that flow in have created an extensive cave system which rises at Brants Gill head. In 2004 the body of an unidentified female, dubbed by the media the \\"Lady of the Hills\\", was found near to the entrance of Sell Gill Hole. Etymology In the Cumbric language, exactly as in today's Welsh, pen meant 'top' or 'head', and y is most likely the definite article (the), exactly as in Modern Welsh y (compare Pen-y-berth 'end of the hedge/copse', or Pen-y-ffordd 'head of the road/way', etc.). The element ghent is more obscure, it could be taken to be 'edge' or 'border'. The name Pen-y-ghent could therefore mean 'Hill on the border' (compare Kent). Or else, the final element may be g√Ønt, meaning \\"a heathen, a gentile\\" (< Latin gentis; c.f. Welsh gynt), presumably in reference to Scandinavian pagans. It is also acceptable to write the name as Pen y Ghent rather than Pen-y-ghent. Geography Hull Pot Beck spilling into Hull Pot. Taken looking north-westwards Pen-y-Ghent is made up of a millstone grit top upon a bed of carboniferous limestone. The summit acts as a watershed with water flowing east into the River Skirfare and on through to the Humber Estuary, and water flowing west dropping into the River Ribble, to ultimately flow into the Irish Sea. The distinctive rakes that adorn the hillside (particularly on the western edge of Pen-y-Ghent) were revealed during a great storm in July 1881. The ferocity of the water cascading down the hillside removed the topsoil and revealed the rakes beneath. Hull Pot Beck rises on the western side of Plover Hill and flows into Hull Pot, which is the largest natural hole in England. Hull Pot measures long by wide and deep. The water then flows under Horton Moor before re-appearing just east of Horton in Ribblesdale as Brants Ghyll Beck, where it flows into the River Ribble. Local legend has it that the waters from Hull Pot and Hunt Pot cross each other underground without mixing. This is said to have first been noted when a sheep wash was undertaken in one stream thereby making it muddy, and the husks of oats being dropped into the other stream and both having exited into the Ribble without mixing together. Hiking The Pennine Way links the summit to the village; the route is around in length as the Way curves initially to the north before turning east to reach the summit. The more direct route that traverses the southern 'nose' of the hill is the route usually taken by those attempting the Yorkshire Three Peaks Challenge, as the walk is usually (but not exclusively) done in an anti-clockwise direction starting and finishing in Horton in Ribblesdale. The other main hillwalking route on the hill heads north from the summit to reach Plover Hill before descending to join Foxup Road, a bridleway at the head of Littondale. Pen-y-ghent is one of the mountains on the Yorkshire Three Peaks route.

The fingerings of the different saxophones are all the same so a saxophone player can play any type of saxophone. The alto saxophone had a prominent role in the development of jazz. Influential jazz musicians who made significant contributions include Don Redman, Jimmy Dorsey, Johnny Hodges, Benny Carter, Charlie Parker, Sonny Stitt, Lee Konitz, Jackie McLean, Phil Woods, Art Pepper, Paul Desmond, and Cannonball Adderley. Although the role of the alto saxophone in classical music has been limited, influential performers include Marcel Mule, Sigurd Rasch√®r, Jean-Marie Londeix, Eugene Rousseau, and Frederick L. Hemke.  Range  The range of the alto saxophone is from concert D3 (the D below middle C‚Äîsee Scientific pitch notation) to concert A5 (or A5 on altos with a high F key). When necessary, a player can extend the instrument's range to concert C3 by putting their knee or foot in the bell. As with most types of saxophone, the standard written range is B3 to F6 (or F6). Above that, the altissimo register begins at F6 (or G6) and extends upwards. The saxophone's altissimo register is more difficult to control than that of other woodwinds and is usually only expected from advanced players. The alto saxophone is a transposing instrument; pitches sound a major sixth lower than written.  Alto saxophonists  left Notable jazz alto saxophonists include Charlie Parker, Cannonball Adderley, Kenny Garrett, Paul Desmond, Benny Carter, Eric Dolphy, Ornette Coleman, Bobby Watson, Marshall Allen, Julius Hemphill, Oliver Lake, Anthony Braxton, Henry Threadgill, Carlos Ward, David Sanborn, Dave Koz, Tom Scott, Paquito D'Rivera, John Zorn, Tim Berne, Steve Wilson, Steve Coleman, Greg Osby, Vincent Herring, Mark Gross, and Jeff Coffin. Notable classical alto saxophonists include Tim McAllister, Jean-Yves Fourmeau, Lawrence Gwozdz, Donald Sinta, Harvey Pittel, Larry Teal, Kenneth Tse, Arno Bornkamp, Harry White, Otis Murphy, Claude Delangle. Kadri Gopalnath was the pioneer of Carnatic music for the instrument.  Manufacturers  Some companies that currently produce saxophones are Buffet Crampon, KHS/Jupiter, Conn-Selmer, Selmer Paris, Yamaha, Leblanc/Vito, Keilwerth, Cannonball, P.Mauriat Musical Instrument and Yanagisawa. New alto saxophones range in price between ‚Ç¨250 ($281.05) for lower quality student models to over ‚Ç¨6000 ($6745.20) for professional models.  Classical music repertoire  The alto saxophone has a large classical solo repertoire that includes solos with orchestra, piano and wind symphony. Two important solo compositions are Jacques Ibert's \\"Concertino da Camera\\" and Alexander Glazunov's \\"Concerto in E Flat major\\". The alto saxophone is found in the standard instrumentation of concert bands and saxophone quartets. Alexander Glazunov composed his Saxophone Quartet in B-flat major in 1932. The alto saxophone is sometimes used in orchestral music. Some of the compositions where it appears are listed below. *Georges Bizet features it in the \\"Minuet\\" from the second suite of music from L'Arl√©sienne. *It was called for by Richard Strauss in his Sinfonia Domestica, which includes parts for four saxophones including an alto saxophone in F. *Dmitri Shostakovich uses the alto in his Suite for Variety Orchestra and it has a prominent solo in the \\"Waltz No. 2\\" section. He also includes it in his Suite No. 1 and Suite No. 2. *Maurice Ravel uses the saxophone prominently in his orchestration of Modest Moussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition, most notably as the soloist in \\"Il vecchio castello\\". *Alban Berg uses the saxophone in his late orchestral works, most notably \\"Der Wein\\", Lulu, and the Violin Concerto. *Sergei Rachmaninoff uses the saxophone in his Symphonic Dances as a soloist in the first movement. *George Gershwin includes it in a few pieces; such as Rhapsody in Blue and An American in Paris. *Pierre Boulez wrote for 2 alto saxes in his composition Pli selon pli (\\"Fold by Fold\\"). *Benjamin Britten calls for an alto in his Sinfonia da Requiem and The Prince of the Pagodas. *Leonard Bernstein includes an alto sax in his Symphonic Dances from West Side Story. *Vincent d'Indy enlists two altos in his opera Fervaal. *Darius Milhaud writes for an alto in La Creation du Monde, and places it in the score where we would expect to see a viola. *Allan Pettersson makes use of an alto in his 16th Symphony. *Krzysztof Penderecki scores for two altos in his opera The Devils of Loudon (\\"Die Teufel von Loudon\\"). *Aram Khatchaturian includes an alto in his ballet Gayane. *Poul Ruders includes a significant solo for the alto saxophone in his orchestral suite Concerto in Pieces. *Eric Coates wrote for an alto in his 1936 Saxo- Rhapsody. *Claude Debussy features an alto in his Rhapsody for Saxophone and Orchestra. *Paul Creston wrote a concerto for the alto as well as a sonata (with piano), a rapsodie (with organ), and included it in a suite for saxophone quartet. *Ronald Binge wrote a concerto for the alto saxophone in E-flat major (1956) *Alan Hovhaness includes an alto in his ballet Is There Survival (also known as King Vahaken) and as part of incidental music he wrote to accompany the play The Flowering Peach.

This is typically achieved by having multiple cartridges stored in a magazine (within or attached to the gun) and then fed into the chamber by the bolt via either a manual or automatic mechanism, while the act of chambering the rifle typically also recocks the action for the following shot. In common usage, the term \\"repeating rifle\\" most often refers specifically to manually-operated weapons, as opposed to self-loading rifles, which use the recoil and blowback of the previous shot to cycle the action and load the next round, even though all self-loading firearms are technically a subcategory of repeating firearms. Repeating rifles were a significant advance over the preceding single-shot breechloading rifles when used for military combat, as they allowed a much greater rate of fire. Repeating rifles saw use in the American Civil War during the early 1860s, and the first repeating air rifle to see military service was the Windb√ºchse Rifle.  Early repeaters  * Jennings Magazine Rifle: in 1847 Walter Hunt patented in Britain a repeating rifle he called \\"the Volitional Repeater\\". He would patent it again in the United States in 1849. This rifle featured a tubular magazine beneath the barrel and a lever mechanism to raise cartridges into the chamber. Unable to finance the building of the rifle, Hunt sold the rights to George Arrowsmith who in turn had an employee, Lewis Jennings, improve the lever mechanism. Courtland Palmer placed the first order for the \\"Jennings Magazine rifle\\" for his hardware store: Robbins & Lawrence. The rifle did not sell well as the ammunition was a hollow based bullet containing gunpowder. Most of the guns were later converted to single shot rifles. Two employees working at Robbins & Lawrence: Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson improved the design and sold it as the \\"Smith-Jennings Repeating Rifle\\". * Lagatz Rifle: a modification of the Lorenzoni System, invented in the 18th century. * Jobard Rifle: a turret rifle with 14 shots patented in Belgium in 1826 and presented to the government in 1835.https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=m1lPqxaxvPEC&pg;=PA529&lpg;=PA529&dq;=Jobard+Fusil&source;=bl&ots;=PiqCatsrcS&sig;=ACfU3U3ilwI2AoqW2Kpl61fJPW2S_gryRw&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjo87bwhJTpAhV5SBUIHTAQAo0Q6AEwCnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q;=Jobard%20Fusil&f;=false * Thomson Rifle: a flintlock repeating rifle patented in 1814, using multiple breeches to obtain repeating fire. * Colette Gravity Pistol: a repeating saloon gun designed in the early 1850s.

Even though the revolver mechanism was fine for pistols, it posed a problem with long guns: without special sealing details, the cylinder produces a gas discharge close to the face when the weapon is fired from the shoulder, as was a common approach with rifles.  Falling block action  Although most falling-blocks were single-shot actions, some early repeaters used this design, notably the Norwegian Krag‚ÄìPetersson and the U. S. Spencer rifle. The former loaded from a Henry-style underbarrel magazine; the latter fed from a tubular magazine in the buttstock.  Lever action  Marlin Model 1894C lever-action carbine in .357 Magnum caliber In a classic lever-action firearm of the Henry-Winchester type, rounds are individually loaded into a tubular magazine parallel to and below the barrel. A short bolt is held in place with an over center toggle action. Once closed, the over center action prevents opening solely by the force on the bolt when the weapon is fired. This toggle action is operated by a hand grip that forms part of the trigger guard. When operated, a spring in the tubular magazine pushes a fresh round into position. Returning the operating lever to the home position chambers the round and closes the breach. An interlock prevents firing unless the toggle is fully closed. The famous Model 1873 Winchester is exemplary of this type. Later lever-action designs, such as Marlin leverguns and those designed for Winchester by John Browning, use one or two vertical locking blocks instead of a toggle-link. There also exist lever-action rifles that feed from a box magazine, which allows them to use pointed bullets. A one-off example of Lever action reloading on automatic firearms is the M1895 Colt‚ÄìBrowning machine gun. This weapon had a swinging lever beneath its barrel that was actuated by a gas bleed in the barrel, unlocking the breech to reload. This unique operation gave the nickname \\"potato digger\\" as the lever swung each time the weapon fired.  Pump action  Colt Lightning .22 pump action rifle With a pump-action firearm, the action is operated by a movable fore-end that the shooter moves backwards and forwards to eject a spent round, and extract and chamber a fresh round of ammunition. Pump-actions are usually associated with shotguns, but one example of a pump-action rifle is the Remington Model 7600 series. Rifles with pump action are also called slide-action. This style of rifle is still popular with some local law enforcement branches as a rifle that is easy to train officers who are already familiar with the pump shotgun.  Bolt action  Opened bolt on a Winchester Model 70. The bolt has an engine turned finish The bolt is a mechanism that is operated by hand to extract a fired cartridge, move a fresh round into the chamber and reset the firing pin, readying the weapon to fire again. The bolt closes the breech end of the barrel and contains the firing pin. The bolt is held in place with a lever that fits into a notch. Moving this lever out of the notch will release the restraint on the bolt, allowing it to be drawn back. An extractor removes the spent cartridge, which is then ejected through the lever slot. A spring at the bottom of the magazine pushes up the reserve rounds, positioning the topmost between the bolt and the chamber at the base of the barrel. Pushing the bolt lever forward chambers this round and pushing the lever into the notch locks the bolt and enables the trigger mechanism. The complete cycle action also resets the firing pin. The Mauser rifle of the late 19th and early 20th centuries is the most famous of the bolt action types, with most similar weapons derived from this pioneering design, such as the M1903 Springfield and the Karabiner 98 Kurz rifle (abbreviated often as Kar98k or simply K98). The Russian Mosin‚ÄìNagant rifle, the British Lee‚ÄìEnfield, and the Norwegian Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen are examples of alternate bolt action designs. = Autoloading =  Blowback  In blowback operation, the bolt is not actually locked at the moment of firing. To prevent violent recoil, in most firearms using this mechanism the opening of the bolt is delayed in some way. In many small arms, the round is fired while the bolt is still travelling forward, and the bolt does not open until this forward momentum is overcome. Other methods involve delaying the opening until two rollers have been forced back into recesses in the receiver in which the bolt is carried. Simple blowback action is simple and inexpensive to manufacture, but is limited in the power it can handle, so it is seen on small caliber weapons such as machine pistols and submachine guns. Lever-delayed blowback, as seen in for example the French FAMAS assault rifle, can also handle more powerful cartridges but is more complicated and expensive to manufacture.  Recoil-operated  M1941 Johnson rifle In a recoil-operated firearm, the breech is locked, and the barrel recoils as part of the firing cycle. In long-recoil actions, such as the Browning Auto-5 shotgun, the barrel and breechblock remain locked for the full recoil travel, and separate on the return; in short-recoil actions, typical of most semiautomatic handguns (e.g. the Colt M1911), the barrel recoils only a short distance before decoupling from the breechblock.  Gas-operated  FN FAL battle rifle In a gas-operated mechanism, a portion of the gases propelling the bullet from the barrel are extracted and used to operate a piston. The motion of this piston in turn unlocks and operates the bolt, which performs extraction of the spent cartridge and via spring action readies the next round. Almost all modern military rifles use mechanisms of this type.

It drains portions of three national forests-- Chattahoochee, Nantahala, and Cherokee-- and provides the southwestern boundary of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The river flows through five major impoundments: Fontana Dam, Cheoah Dam, Calderwood Dam, Chilhowee Dam, and Tellico Dam, and one smaller impoundment, Porters Bend Dam. Course The Little Tennessee River rises in the Blue Ridge Mountains, in the Chattahoochee National Forest in northeast Georgia's Rabun County. After flowing north through the mountains past Dillard into southwestern North Carolina, it is joined by the Cullasaja River at Franklin. The river then turns northwest, flowing through the Nantahala National Forest along the north side of the Nantahala Mountains. It crosses into eastern Tennessee and joins the Tennessee River at Lenoir City, 25 miles (40 km) southwest of Knoxville. Impoundments The lower river is impounded several places by sequential dams, some created as part of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) system; they form a string of reservoirs in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee down to the river's confluence with the Tennessee. Near the state line between North Carolina and Tennessee, the Little Tennessee River is impounded by the Fontana Dam, completed in 1944, forming Fontana Lake along the southern boundary of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. It is also impounded by Cheoah Dam in North Carolina, and by Calderwood and Chilhowee dams in Tennessee. The reservoirs provide flood control and hydroelectric power. Calderwood and Cheoah dams divert water through short tunnels slightly downstream of the dams themselves to hydroelectric generators. Chilhowee has power generators built straight into the dam itself. Some water is also diverted from the nearby Santeetlah Dam on the Cheoah River to power another hydroelectric generator at the Santeetlah Powerhouse. This water is brought to the Little Tennessee River through of tunnels through the Great Smoky Mountains. Chilhowee, Calderwood, and Cheoah Dams and the Santeetlah Powerhouse were originally built by Alcoa to power the aluminum plant at Alcoa, Tennessee. To ensure efficiency in operation, Alcoa coordinates the operation of its hydro system with TVA, making sure that reservoir and river water levels are safe for recreational use (primarily boating and fishing) and that proper flows of water continue down the river. The final impoundment is Tellico Dam, which is just above its mouth into the Tennessee River at Lenoir City, Tennessee. It creates Tellico Reservoir. The dam does not have its own hydroelectric generators but serves to increase the flow through those at nearby Fort Loudoun Dam on the Tennessee by means of a canal which diverts much of the flow of the Little Tennessee. The plan to build the dam was the subject of environmental controversy during the 1970s regarding the snail darter, an endangered species.Richard Polhemus, The Toqua Site -- 40MR6, Vol. I (Norris, Tenn.: Tennessee Valley Authority, 1987), 1.

Construction and commissioning Chester was launched on 3 July 1929 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey; sponsored by Miss J. T. Blain; commissioned on 24 June 1930, Captain Arthur Fairfield in command; and reported to the Atlantic Fleet. Inter-war period Chester cleared Newport, Rhode Island, on 13 August 1930 for an extensive European cruise. She visited Barcelona, Naples, Constantinople, Phaleron Bay, and Gibraltar before returning to Chester, Pennsylvania, for voyage repairs on 13 October. She joined the Scouting Fleet as flagship for Commander, Light Cruiser Divisions, and on 6 March 1931, embarked the Secretary of the Navy for the Canal Zone where he observed the annual fleet problem from . Chester carried the secretary back to Miami, Fla., arriving on 22 March, then sailed to Narragansett Bay for exercises and duty escorting two visiting French cruisers. Originally classified as a light cruiser, CL-27, because of her thin armor, Chester was redesignated a heavy cruiser, CA-27, because of her 8-inch guns in accordance with the provisions of the London Naval Treaty of 1930, effective 1 July 1931. Following an overhaul at New York Navy Yard during which she was equipped with two catapults amidships, Chester stood out of Hampton Roads on 31 July 1932 with planes and ammunition for the West Coast. She arrived at San Pedro, California, on 14 August and joined in the regular activities of the fleet. Departing San Pedro on 9 April 1934 as flagship of Commander, Special Service Squadron, she arrived in New York on 31 May for that day's Presidential Naval Review, returning to San Pedro on 9 November. Ensign Richard O'Kane, who would win the Medal of Honor as the most successful United States submarine officer of World War II, served aboard Chester for one year as a junior gun division officer and then as signal officer following graduation from the United States Naval Academy in 1934.O'Kane, Richard H. WAHOO The Patrols of America's Most Famous WWII Submarine (1987) Presidio Press pp.1-3 On 25 September 1935, Chester embarked the Secretary of War and his party for a voyage to the Philippines in connection with the inauguration of the president of the Philippines Commonwealth on 15 November. Returning to San Francisco on 14 December 1935, she resumed operations with Cruiser Division 4. Sailing from San Francisco on 28 October 1936, Chester arrived at Charleston, South Carolina, on 13 November and departed five days later to escort with President Franklin Roosevelt embarked for a good-will visit to Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Montevideo, Uruguay. Chester returned to San Pedro on 24 December. Chester remained on the West Coast for fleet exercises and training cruises to Hawaiian and Alaskan waters from 1937 except for a cruise to the East Coast for exercises and overhaul (23 September 1940 ‚Äì 21 January 1941). Chester was one of six ships to receive the new RCA CXAM radar in 1940. Home-ported at Pearl Harbor from 3 February, the cruiser exercised in Hawaiian waters, and made one voyage to the West Coast with Commander, Scouting Force embarked (14 May 1941 ‚Äì 18 June 1941). From 10 October to 13 November, she escorted two army transports carrying reinforcements to Manila, Philippines Islands. Upon her return, she joined and and was at sea returning from Wake Island when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. World War II Chester remained on patrol with Task Force 8 (TF 8) in Hawaiian waters. On 12 December, her planes bombed a submarine, then guided to a depth charge attack which continued until contact was lost. =1942= Chester supported the reinforcement landing on Samoa (18‚Äì24 January 1942), then joined Task Group 8.3 (TG 8.3) commanded by Adm. William Halsey for the successful raid on Taroa (1 February). Retiring under heavy air attack, she received a bomb hit in the well deck which killed eight and injured 38. The Chester was the only surface ship to lose men in the first surface attack of the Pacific war. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 3 February for repairs. Following an escort voyage to San Francisco, Chester joined TF 17 for the Guadalcanal-Tulagi raid (4 May); the attack on Misima Island, Louisiade Archipelago (7 May); and the Battle of the Coral Sea (8 May) during which her steady antiaircraft fire protected the carriers providing the air strikes which stopped the invasion force heading for Port Moresby, New Guinea. Five of Chesters crew were wounded in this encounter. On 10 May, she received 478 survivors of from , whom she transferred to Tonga Island on 15 May. After a West Coast overhaul, Chester arrived at Noum√©a on 21 September 1942, to join TF 62 for the landings on Funafuti, Ellice Islands (2‚Äì4 October). She then proceeded south and while cruising in support of the operations in the Solomons, specifically north of the New Hebrides Islands, Chester was hit by a torpedo from on the starboard side, amidships on 20 October which killed 11 and wounded 12. She returned to Espiritu Santo under her own power for emergency repairs on 23 October. Three days later, struck a mine, and Chester sent fire and rescue parties to her aid as well as taking on the 440 survivors for transfer to Espiritu Santo. She steamed to Sydney, Australia, on 29 October for further repairs and on Christmas Day, departed for Norfolk and a complete overhaul. =1943= Returning to San Francisco on 13 September 1943, Chester operated on escort duty between that port and Pearl Harbor until 20 October. On 8 November, she cleared Pearl Harbor for the invasion of the Gilbert Islands. On 18‚Äì20 November, after air attacks, destroyers and cruisers bombarded Tarawa. Chester was the lead ship and received some accurate fire from the beach the first two days. The Chester, along with the rest of the division, also bombarded Apemoma, another of the Gilberts. She covered the landings on Abemama Island and bombarded Taroa, Wotje, and Maloelap. =1944= Chester assumed antisubmarine and antiaircraft patrol off Majuro until 25 April 1944, when she sailed for San Francisco and brief overhaul (6‚Äì22 May). She joined TF 94 at Adak Island, Alaska, on 27 May for the bombardments of Matsuwa and Paramushiru in the Kuriles on 13 June and 26 June, then sailed to Pearl Harbor, arriving on 13 August. Chester sortied on 29 August with TG 12.5 for the bombardment of Wake Island (3 September), then arrived at Eniwetok on 6 September. She cruised off Saipan and participated in the bombardment of Marcus Island on 9 October, before joining TG 38.1 for the carrier strikes on Luzon and Samar in support of the Leyte operations, as well as searching for enemy forces after the Battle for Leyte Gulf (25‚Äì26 October). =1945= From 8 November 1944 to 21 February 1945, Chester operated from Ulithi and Saipan in bombardment of Iwo Jima and the Bonins, supporting the invasion landings of 19 February. After another West Coast overhaul, Chester returned to Ulithi on 21 June, and conducted patrols off Okinawa from 27 June, as well as covering minesweeping operations west of the island. In late July, Chester was assigned to the force supplying air cover for the Coast Striking Group (TG 95.2) off the Yangtze River Delta and protecting minesweeping. In August, she made a voyage to the Aleutians, and on the last day of the month sailed to participate in the occupation landings at Ominato, Aomori, Hakodate, and Otaru in September and October. Post-war Chester embarked homeward bound troops at Iwo Jima, and sailed on 2 November for San Francisco, arriving on 18 November. She made another voyage to Guam to bring home servicemen (24 November ‚Äì 17 December), then steamed on 14 January 1946 for Philadelphia, arriving on 30 January. Chester was placed out of commission in reserve in Philadelphia on 10 June. She was sold for scrap on 11 August 1959. Awards Chester received 11 battle stars for World War II service.

He is best known for making what is generally considered the first widely reported modern unidentified flying object sighting in the United States, after claiming to have seen nine unusual objects flying in tandem near Mount Rainier, Washington on June 24, 1947. Early life and career Arnold was born in Sebeka, Minnesota, but grew up in Scobey, Montana. He attended the University of Minnesota, where he was coached in football by Bernie Bierman. Arnold began Great Western Fire Control Supply in Boise, Idaho in 1940, a company that sold and installed fire suppression systems, a job that took him around the Pacific Northwest. Arnold was regarded as a skilled and experienced pilot, with over 9,000 total flying hours, almost half of which were devoted to Search and Rescue Mercy Flyer efforts.Diana Palmer Hoyt, \\"UFOCRITIQUE: UFO's, Social Intelligence and the Condon Committee\\"; Master's Thesis, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, 2000; read it online He ran unsuccessfully for Lieutenant Governor of Idaho in 1962. UFO sighting On June 24, 1947, Arnold claimed that, while flying near Mt. Rainier in Washington State, he had seen nine unusual objects flying in the skies. Arnold also claimed to have seen UFOs on several subsequent occasions. Arnold originally described the objects' shape as \\"flat like a pie pan\\", \\"shaped like a pie plate\\", \\"half-moon shaped, oval in front and convex in the rear\\", \\"something like a pie plate that was cut in half with a sort of a convex triangle in the rear\\", or simply \\"saucer-like\\" or \\"like a big flat disk\\" (see quotes), and also described their erratic motion being \\"like a fish flipping in the sun\\" or a saucer skipped across water. From these, the press quickly coined the new terms \\"flying saucer\\"Edward J. Ruppelt, The Report on the Unidentied Flying Objects, Ballantine, 1960. and \\"flying disc\\" to describe such objects, many of which were reported within days after Arnold's sighting. Later Arnold would add that one of the objects actually resembled a crescent or flying wing. The U.S. Air Force formally listed the Arnold case as \\"unknown\\". According to Project Blue Book leader Edward J. Ruppelt, some in the Air Force favored the possibility of nearby jet airplanes seen distorted through a mirage; this is one of many explanations that have been disputed by critics, and researchers Jerome Clark, author of The UFO Book (1998)Jerome Clark, The UFO Book: Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial. Visible Ink, 1998. and Ronald Story, editor of The Encyclopedia of UFOs (1980).Story, Ronald, editor, The Encyclopedia of UFOs, Garden City: Doubleday & Company, Inc, 1980, Both argue that there has never been an entirely persuasive conventional explanation of the Arnold sighting. After his UFO sighting, Arnold became a minor celebrity, and for about a decade thereafter, he was somewhat involved in interviewing other UFO witnesses or contactees. Notably, he investigated the claims of Samuel Eaton Thompson, one of the first contactees. Arnold wrote a book and several magazine articles about his UFO sighting and his subsequent research. By the 1960s, Arnold had tired of his notoriety and UFOs in general, and he eventually declined all interviews. On June 24, 1977, however, he attended the First International UFO Congress in Chicago, curated by Fate to mark the 30th anniversary of the \\"birth\\" of the modern UFO age. Some of his comments at the event reflected his displeasure at the general ignorance concerning the matter: Personal life Arnold and his wife Doris had four daughters. He died, aged 68, from colon cancer at Overlake Hospital in Bellevue, Washington. Bibliography *The Real Flying Saucers, Other Worlds (January 1952) *The Coming of the Saucers (1952) (with Raymond A.

The star of the Indians pitching staff, he won over 20 games each year from the epidemic-shortened 1918 season through 1921, leading the AL in shutouts twice and in strikeouts and earned run average (ERA) once each during his nine years with the club. The star of the 1920 World Series, he led the Indians to their first title with three complete-game victories, including a 3‚Äì0 shutout in the Game 7 finale. Traded to the Washington Senators after the 1924 season, he helped that club to its second AL pennant in a row with 20 victories against only 5 losses, including a 13-game winning streak, while again leading the league in ERA. Coveleski followed in the footsteps of his brother Harry as a major league pitcher. But after making his debut with the Philadelphia Athletics in 1912, he was sidetracked by three more seasons in the minor leagues before joining the Indians in 1916, and won only 13 major league games before turning 27. Coveleski specialized in throwing the spitball, where the pitcher alters the ball with a foreign substance such as chewing tobacco. It was legal when his career began but prohibited in 1920, with Coveleski being one of 17 pitchers permitted to continue throwing the pitch. In 450 career games, Coveleski pitched 3,082 innings and posted a record of 215‚Äì142, with 224 complete games, 38 shutouts, and a 2.89 ERA. He set Cleveland records of 172 wins, innings and 305 starts, which were later broken by Mel Harder and Willis Hudlin. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1969. Early years Stanislaus Anthony Kowalewski was born in Shamokin, Pennsylvania, one of eight children of Anthony (1845-1929) and Ann (Racicz) Kowalewski (1850-1919), who had immigrated from Russian Poland in the early 1870s. They settled in Shamokin, where Anthony worked as a coal miner, in Northumberland County, east of the Susquehanna River and northeast of the state capital of Harrisburg.Kashatus, pp. 9‚Äì10. Stanley was the youngest of five baseball-playing brothers; his oldest brother Jacob died serving in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War (1898). In addition to his older brother, Harry (1886‚Äì1950), who pitched in the major leagues between 1907 and 1918, their other brothers Frank and John also played professional baseball, but only in the minor leagues. Harry won 20 games in a season on three occasions during his 14-year major league career. Like many his age in the Shamokin area, Coveleski began work as a \\"breaker boy\\" at a local colliery at the age of 12. In return for 72 hours of labor per week, Coveleski received $3.75, or about five cents an hour.Kashatus, p. 9. \\"There was nothing strange in those days about a twelve-year-old Polish kid working in the mines for 72 hours a week at a nickel an hour\\", he later recalled. \\"What was strange is that I ever got out of there\\". Coveleski was rarely able to play baseball as a child due to his work schedule. Nevertheless, he worked on his pitching skills during the evenings, when he threw stones at a tin can placed 50 feet away.Kashatus, p. 10. When he was 18 years old, Coveleski's abilities caught the attention of the local semi-professional ball club, which invited him to pitch for them. \\"When it came to throwing a baseball, why it was easy to pitch\\", Coveleski recalled. \\"After all, the plate's a lot bigger than a tin can to throw at\\". His baseball career in Shamokin was short-lived; after five games, Coveleski relocated to Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Philadelphia Athletics and minor leagues Coveleski signed his first professional contract in 1909 with the minor league Lancaster Red Roses, a club affiliated with the Tri-State League. Originally reluctant to sign for the club, he only agreed to do so if his older brother John also joined; at that time he anglicized his name, changing it to Coveleskie, which it would remain throughout his professional career. During his first trip to Lancaster, he recalled that it was \\"the first time I ever rode on a train\\", and he added that he \\"was too shy to eat in the hotel with the rest of the team\\".Kashatus, p. 44. In 272 innings of work his first season, Coveleski had a 23‚Äì11 win-loss record with an earned run average of 1.95. He pitched two more seasons for Lancaster, earning a record of 53‚Äì38 in 109 appearances through three seasons. 1909 Lancaster Red Roses; Stan Coveleski is standing fourth from left In 1912, he pitched for the relocated Lancaster team, the Atlantic City Lanks, where he had a 20‚Äì14 record with a 2.53 ERA in 40 appearances, 30 of them starts. In September 1912, manager Connie Mack signed him to a contract with the Philadelphia Athletics and brought him to the major leagues. By the time Coveleski made his debut for the Athletics on September 10, pitching one inning in relief in an 8-6 road loss to the Detroit Tigers, the two-time defending World Series champions were more than a dozen games out of first place - the only year between 1910 and 1914 they failed to win the pennant. Coveleski won his first game two days later in his first start, a 3-0 three- hit shutout of the Tigers, allowing only two singles and a double by Ty Cobb. He pitched in five games for the Athletics that season, starting two of them and finishing the season with a 2‚Äì1 record and a 3.43 ERA. After the season ended, Mack felt that Coveleski needed more seasoning, and sent him to the Spokane Indians of the Northwestern League. Coveleski finished the 1913 season with a 17‚Äì20 record and a 2.82 ERA. Around that time, he married Mary Stivetts, and the following season he went 20‚Äì15, pitched over 300 innings, and led the league in strikeouts. At the time of his debut, the powerhouse Philadelphia club boasted a strong group of talented pitchers, including Eddie Plank, Chief Bender, and Jack Coombs. Coveleski admitted that he \\"[didn't] know if I could have beat them out for a spot in the rotation.\\"Kashatus, p. 86. After the 1914 season, the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League wanted Coveleski, and traded five players to Spokane to acquire him. While Mack had an agreement with Spokane that Coveleski would be promoted after playing there for a time, the Athletics fell under new ownership in 1913 and lost control of him due to the Athletics' rights expiring.Macht, pp. 559‚Äì560 Coveleski spent his time in Portland learning to throw the spitball; originally using chewing tobacco, he later used alum. In his lone season with Portland, he won and lost 17 games, and had a 2.67 ERA. After the season ended, the Cleveland Indians purchased Coveleski from Portland, and he joined the major league squad in 1916. Cleveland Indians Cleveland in 1918 When Coveleski was brought up to the majors, the original intention was to use him as a relief pitcher. Due to an injury to Ed Klepfer, the Indians used him as a starter early on in the 1916 season, and kept him in the role when he performed well. He was scheduled to pitch in the first week of the season against his brother Harry, but the matchup never took place at Harry's behest. On May 30, Coveleski hit the only home run of his career in the first game of a road doubleheader against the St. Louis Browns; the three-run shot in the tenth inning gave Cleveland a 4-1 lead, but the Browns came back to win 5-4 in 15 innings. Coveleski fought health problems during the season, suffering from tonsillitis in the middle of the year and pitching one game with a fever of . He finished the season with a 15‚Äì13 record and a 3.41 ERA in 45 games, 27 of them starts. Coveleski had lost 10 pounds due to illness during 1916, but recovered during the offseason, gained 20 pounds, and appeared healthier by the time the season began. Baseball card of Coveleski; he originally spelled his last name as Coveleskie. Coveleski's status as the ace of the staff was demonstrated when he was named the starter for Opening Day of the 1917 season; he beat the Detroit Tigers 6‚Äì4 on April 11. He improved statistically during the 1917 season, winning 19 games and losing 14 with an ERA of 1.81 and a career-high 133 strikeouts. On September 19, Coveleski pitched the only one- hitter of his career, a 2-0 road win over the New York Yankees; the only hit came from Fritz Maisel in the seventh inning.Schneider, p. 156. Coveleski continued to improve during the 1918 season, which was ended on September 1 due to the late-summer surge of the Spanish flu pandemic. His outings that year included 2-1 13-inning road loss to Philadelphia on May 15, in which he had a career-high ten strikeouts, and a 19-inning complete game on May 24 in New York as the Indians won 3‚Äì2. He finished the season with a 22‚Äì13 record, a 1.82 ERA, and 311 innings pitched in 38 games, 33 of them starts; his wins and ERA were both second in the American League to Walter Johnson. In 1919, Coveleski pitched in 43 games, starting 34, and had a 24‚Äì12 record and an ERA of 2.61. At the beginning of the 1920 season, the spitball was banned by Major League Baseball. As a current spitball pitcher, Coveleski was grandfathered in, and was allowed to continue using the pitch until his retirement. He won his first seven starting appearances of the season, but on May 28 his wife died suddenly, and he was given some time off to mourn, returning to pitching two weeks later. He picked up his 100th victory on August 2 with a 2-0 shutout win over the Senators. Covaleski was the starting pitcher against the Yankees on August 16, and hit a sacrifice fly to help the Indians win 4‚Äì3, but it is best remembered as the game in which a pitch by the Yankees' Carl Mays hit Indians shortstop Ray Chapman in the head, resulting in the only death in major league history.Sowell, pp. 172‚Äì174. Covaleski finished the 1920 regular season with 24 wins, 14 losses, a 2.49 ERA, and 133 strikeouts; he led the AL in strikeouts and finished second in ERA to Bob Shawkey. Coveleski helped the Indians to win the AL pennant and play in the 1920 World Series against the Brooklyn Robins. Coveleski was the star of the Series, in which he pitched three complete game victories. He pitched the first game against Rube Marquard, and allowed one run and five hits in a 3‚Äì1 Cleveland victory. Four days later, he pitched Game 4, again allowing one run and five hits in a 5‚Äì1 win. In Game 7, the final one of the best-of-nine series, Coveleski threw a complete game shutout with five hits against fellow spitballer Burleigh Grimes; the 3‚Äì0 victory gave the Indians the first World Series championship in franchise history. Coveleski had an ERA of 0.67, which remains a World Series record. After spending the offseason hunting with Smoky Joe Wood,Sowell, p. 279. Coveleski returned to the Indians in 1921, and throughout the season, the Indians battled the Yankees for first in the American League. On September 26, the two teams faced off, but Coveleski failed to make it past the third inning; the Yankees won 8‚Äì7 to ensure they won the pennant. Coveleski pitched 315 innings in 1921, matching his career high from the year before, and had a 23‚Äì13 record and a 3.37 ERA. The following season, Coveleski married Frances Stivetts, the sister of his late wife. While he did cause the Yankees to move out of first place after winning an August 23 game against them, 4‚Äì1, it was his last game of the season. He finished the year with a 17‚Äì14 record, the first time since 1917 he did not have 20 wins, and a 3.32 ERA. Early on in the 1923 season, Coveleski pitched 27 straight scoreless innings between April 22 and 30, starting with a 10-inning 1-0 shutout of the Tigers and ending when he allowed two runs in the ninth inning of a 4-2 road win over the same club. However, he won less frequently as the season wore on, losing three straight games in mid-August. His last game came on August 15, with over a month left in the season. Coveleski finished the season with a 13‚Äì14 record, his first season with a losing record. Despite that, he had an ERA of 2.76 and five shutouts, both of which led the AL. In 1924, Coveleski struggled, and at the end of May, he had four losses and an ERA of 6.49. On June 16 he broke Addie Joss' club record of 160 wins with a 2-1 complete-game win over the Yankees, with the winning run scoring with two out in the bottom of the ninth on second baseman Ernie Johnson's error, with Coveleski batting; he had tied Joss' record two days earlier with a relief win in an 11-inning victory over the Boston Red Sox. In his last appearance on September 22, he gave up a career-high ten runs in a 10-4 loss to the Yankees, ending the season with a 15‚Äì16 record and a 4.04 ERA. In December 1924, after nine years pitching for Cleveland, Coveleski was traded to the Washington Senators for pitcher By Speece and outfielder Carr Smith. Despite Coveleski's success in Cleveland, he was not a fan of playing there; he stated that he \\"didn't like the town. Now the people are all right, but I just didn't like the town.\\" He also stated that it began to affect his performance on the mound and that he began to get \\"lazy\\" from being with the club so long. He did, however, have praise for his catcher: \\"The best thing that happened to me there was pitching to Steve O'Neill. He caught me for nine years in Cleveland and knew me so well he didn't even need to give me a sign\\". Washington Senators and New York Yankees Due to the acquisition of Coveleski, combined with winning the 1924 World Series, the Washington Senators were considered favorites to win the AL in 1925. During his first season in Washington, Coveleski bounced back from his 1924 season, and by mid-July, critics regarded his success as the biggest surprise in baseball; Cleveland had considered him to be past his best. From May 9 to July 26 he compiled thirteen consecutive victories, ten of them complete games. He won twenty games and lost five that year, and his ERA of 2.84 led the AL. Coveleski also finished 12th in MVP voting that year, with Senators shortstop Roger Peckinpaugh winning the award. The Senators won the AL and were to face the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1925 World Series, but Coveleski suffered from sore back muscles late in the season. Coveleski pitched two games in the World Series. In Game 2, he faced Vic Aldridge in a pitcher's duel; the teams were tied at one apiece in the eighth inning, but a two-run home run by the Pirates' Kiki Cuyler led to a 3‚Äì2 loss.Thomas, pp. 275‚Äì276. Aldridge and Coveleski faced off again in Game 5, but Coveleski allowed four runs before being pulled with one out in the seventh inning, leading to a 6‚Äì3 Pirates win.Thomas, p. 279. The Senators lost the series in seven games, and he finished with a 3.77 ERA, five walks, three strikeouts, and two of the Senators' four losses. Coveleski continued to pitch for Washington during the 1926 season. His performances that season included his 200th win, a 5-3 win in Cleveland on June 10, and a 2‚Äì0 victory against the Boston Red Sox on August 31, a game which was finished in only 78 minutes. Coveleski finished the season with 14 wins, 11 losses, 3 shutouts, and a 3.12 ERA in 36 games. To start the 1927 season, due to an injury to Walter Johnson, Coveleski became the Senators' Opening Day starter against the Red Sox; he won the game 6‚Äì2.Thomas, p. 293. However, his performance declined due to \\"a chronically sore arm\\", which limited his playing time that season.Kashatus, p. 88. Due to his sore arm, the Senators released him unconditionally on June 17, 1927. He finished the season with a 2‚Äì1 record and a 3.14 ERA in five games. On December 21, 1927, Coveleski signed with the New York Yankees in an attempt at a comeback. In his final season, he posted a 5‚Äì1 record with a 5.74 ERA in 12 appearances. Coveleski failed to regain his form, however, pitching his last game on August 3, and after the signing of Tom Zachary, manager Miller Huggins released Coveleski. He retired from the game later that year. Later life and legacy In 1929, after leaving major league baseball, Coveleski relocated to South Bend, Indiana. There, he ran Coveleski Service Station for a time but closed the business during the Great Depression. He became a popular member of the community in South Bend, providing free pitching lessons to local youths in a field behind his garage.Kashatus, p. 126. After his playing career ended, he dropped the \\"e\\" at the end of his name, as he never corrected anyone if his last name was incorrectly spelled.Nemec, p. 98. In 1969, Coveleski was named to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans' Committee alongside 1920s pitcher Waite Hoyt. Of his introduction into the Hall, he said, \\"I figured I'd make it sooner or later, and I just kept hoping each year would be the one.\\" His health declined in later years, and he was eventually admitted to a local nursing home, where he died on March 20, 1984, at the age of 94. In addition to Coveleski's induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame, he was inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame in 1976. In 1984, the minor league baseball stadium in South Bend, Indiana, was named in his honor. Coveleski was interviewed by Lawrence Ritter for his 1966 book The Glory of Their Times, a series of interviews with players of the early 20th century. To fellow ballplayers, Coveleski was considered \\"taciturn and ornery\\" on days when he was scheduled to pitch but was otherwise friendly with a lively sense of humor. Coveleski had 215 wins and 142 losses with a 2.89 ERA in 450 games, 385 of them starts, in a 14-year career. He had 224 complete games, 38 shutouts, 981 strikeouts, and pitched 3,082 total innings. His control was highly regarded. He never considered himself a strikeout pitcher, and it was not unusual for him to pitch a complete game having thrown 95 pitches or less. He once pitched seven innings of a game where every pitch was either a hit or a strike.Sowell, p. 99. In 2001, baseball writer Bill James ranked Coveleski 58th among the all-time greatest major league pitchers.James, p. 882.

Bly, The Elements of Technical Writing, pg. 117. New York: Macmillan Publishers, 1993. When used, an abstract always appears at the beginning of a manuscript or typescript, acting as the point-of-entry for any given academic paper or patent application. Abstracting and indexing services for various academic disciplines are aimed at compiling a body of literature for that particular subject. The terms pr√©cis or synopsis are used in some publications to refer to the same thing that other publications might call an \\"abstract\\". In management reports, an executive summary usually contains more information (and often more sensitive information) than the abstract does. Purpose and limitations Academic literature uses the abstract to succinctly communicate complex research. An abstract may act as a stand-alone entity instead of a full paper. As such, an abstract is used by many organizations as the basis for selecting research that is proposed for presentation in the form of a poster, platform/oral presentation or workshop presentation at an academic conference. Most literature database search engines index only abstracts rather than providing the entire text of the paper. Full texts of scientific papers must often be purchased because of copyright and/or publisher fees and therefore the abstract is a significant selling point for the reprint or electronic form of the full text. The abstract can convey the main results and conclusions of a scientific article but the full text article must be consulted for details of the methodology, the full experimental results, and a critical discussion of the interpretations and conclusions. An abstract allows one to sift through copious numbers of papers for ones in which the researcher can have more confidence that they will be relevant to his or her research. Once papers are chosen based on the abstract, they must be read carefully to be evaluated for relevance. It is generally agreed that one must not base reference citations on the abstract alone, but the content of an entire paper. According to the results of a study published in PLOS Medicine, the \\"exaggerated and inappropriate coverage of research findings in the news media\\" is ultimately related to inaccurately reporting or over-interpreting research results in many abstract conclusions. A study published in JAMA concluded that \\"inconsistencies in data between abstract and body and reporting of data and other information solely in the abstract are relatively common and that a simple educational intervention directed to the author is ineffective in reducing that frequency.\\" Other \\"studies comparing the accuracy of information reported in a journal abstract with that reported in the text of the full publication have found claims that are inconsistent with, or missing from, the body of the full article.\\"  History  Perhaps the earliest use of abstracts to communicate science were from the early 1800's, where the Royal Society would publish 'abstracts' summarizing the presented papers during meetings.https://www.insidescience.org/news/what%E2%80%99s-so-abstract-about- scientific-abstracts Three decades later, the Royal Society compiled abstracts of previous papers published from 1800 - 1837, in the societies journal Philosophical Transactions, titled Abstracts of the Papers Printed in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. https://www.jstor.org/journal/abstpapeprinphil This practice took hold and later other journals followed suite. Perhaps the earliest example of an abstract bound to the same article dates to the 1919 paper On the Irregularities of Motion of the Foucault Pendulum published in the Physical Review, the oldest journal published by the American Physical Society,https://www.insidescience.org/news/what%E2%80%99s-so-abstract-about- scientific-abstracts and the journal often published abstracts in its volumes thereafter.

However, publishers of scientific articles invariably make abstracts freely available, even when the article itself is not. For example, articles in the biomedical literature are available publicly from MEDLINE which is accessible through PubMed. Structure An academic abstract typically outlines four elements relevant to the completed work: * The research focus (i.e. statement of the problem(s)/research issue(s) addressed); * The research methods used (experimental research, case studies, questionnaires, etc.); * The results/findings of the research; and * The main conclusions and recommendations It may also contain brief references, although some publications' standard style omits references from the abstract, reserving them for the article body (which, by definition, treats the same topics but in more depth). Abstract length varies by discipline and publisher requirements. Typical length ranges from 100 to 500 words, but very rarely more than a page and occasionally just a few words. An abstract may or may not have the section title of \\"abstract\\" explicitly listed as an antecedent to content. Abstracts are typically sectioned logically as an overview of what appears in the paper, with any of the following subheadings: Background, Introduction, Objectives, Methods, Results, Conclusions. Abstracts in which these subheadings are explicitly given are often called structured abstracts. Abstracts that comprise one paragraph (no explicit subheadings) are often called unstructured abstracts. =Example= Example taken from the Journal of Biology, Volume 3, Issue 2.: > The hydrodynamics of dolphin drafting > by Daniel Weihs, Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, Technion, Israel > Institute of Technology, Haifa 32000, Israel. Abstract: Background Drafting > in cetaceans is defined as the transfer of forces between individuals > without actual physical contact between them. This behavior has long been > surmised to explain how young dolphin calves keep up with their rapidly > moving mothers. It has recently been observed that a significant number of > calves become permanently separated from their mothers during chases by tuna > vessels. A study of the hydrodynamics of drafting, initiated inmechanisms > causing the separation of mothers and calves during fishing-related > activities, is reported here. Results Quantitative results are shown for the > forces and moments around a pair of unequally sized dolphin-like slender > bodies. These include two major effects. First, the so-called Bernoulli > suction, which stems from the fact that the local pressure drops in areas of > high speed, results in an attractive force between mother and calf. Second > is the displacement effect, in which the motion of the mother causes the > water in front to move forwards and radially outwards, and water behind the > body to move forwards to replace the animal's mass. Thus, the calf can gain > a 'free ride' in the forward-moving areas. Utilizing these effects, the > neonate can gain up to 90% of the thrust needed to move alongside the mother > at speeds of up to 2.4 m/s. A comparison with observations of eastern > spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) is presented, showing savings of up > to 60% in the thrust that calves require if they are to keep up with their > mothers. Conclusions A theoretical analysis, backed by observations of free- > swimming dolphin schools, indicates that hydrodynamic interactions with > mothers play an important role in enabling dolphin calves to keep up with > rapidly moving adult school members. ¬© 2004 Weihs; licensee BioMed Central > Ltd.

Usually between 100 and 200 words, the informative abstract summarizes the paper's structure, its major topics and key points. A format for scientific short reports that is similar to an informative abstract has been proposed in recent years. Informative abstracts may be viewed as standalone documents. =Descriptive= The descriptive abstract, also known as the limited abstract or the indicative abstract, provides a description of what the paper covers without delving into its substance. A descriptive abstract is akin to a table of contents in paragraph form. Graphical abstracts During the late 2000s, due to the influence of computer storage and retrieval systems such as the Internet, some scientific publications, primarily those published by Elsevier, started including graphical abstracts alongside the text abstracts. The graphic is intended to summarize or be an exemplar for the main thrust of the article. It is not intended to be as exhaustive a summary as the text abstract, rather it is supposed to indicate the type, scope, and technical coverage of the article at a glance. The use of graphical abstracts has been generally well received by the scientific community. Moreover, some journals also include video abstracts and animated abstracts made by the authors to easily explain their papers. Many scientific publishers currently encourage authors to supplement their articles with graphical abstracts, in the hope that such a convenient visual summary will facilitate readers with a clearer outline of papers that are of interest and will result in improved overall visibility of the respective publication. However, the validity of this assumption has not been thoroughly studied, and a recent study statistically comparing publications with or without graphical abstracts with regard to several output parameters reflecting visibility failed to demonstrate an effectiveness of graphical abstracts for attracting attention to scientific publications.  Abstract quality assessment  Various methods can be used to evaluate abstract quality, e.g. rating by readers, checklists (not necessary in structured abstracts), and readability measures (such as Flesch Reading Ease).

She was active throughout the Pacific War. USS Louisville was the first large warship to be built in a drydock. Louisville was launched on 1 September 1930 at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington, sponsored by Miss Jane Brown Kennedy, and commissioned on 15 January 1931, Captain Edward John Marquart in command. Louisville since commissioning day has carried, on the prominent bulkhead, a shoe of the great stallion, Man o' War, as a talisman against evil. She was originally classified as a light cruiser, CL-28, because of her thin armor. Effective 1 July 1931, Louisville was redesignated a heavy cruiser, CA-28, because of her 8-inch guns in accordance with the provisions of the London Naval Treaty of 1930. Service history =Interwar period= USS Louisville in 1938 Louisvilles shakedown cruise, running through the summer, fall, and winter of 1931, took her from Bremerton to New York City via the Panama Canal. Returning from New York, she participated in the 1932 fleet problems before commencing gunnery exercises in the San Pedro-San Diego area. During the winter of 1933, she steamed for Hawaii, returning after exercises to San Pedro where she became a schoolship for anti-aircraft (AA) training. In April 1934, the cruiser steamed out of San Diego to begin a nine-month voyage \\"showing the flag\\" at various ports in Central America, the Caribbean Sea, and along the gulf and east coasts. Arriving back in California in late fall, Louisville participated in gunnery and tactical exercises until the spring of 1935, when she departed for Dutch Harbor, Alaska, and, thence, to Pearl Harbor to take part in fleet problems. For the next two years, she operated off the West Coast, participating in the 1936 and 1937 fleet problems, making good will calls at Latin American ports and undergoing local training operations. On 16 July 1937 at about 1200 hours, she collided with the American halibut-fishing boat Alten in the harbor at Ketchikan, Territory of Alaska; she and a United States Coast Guard Cutter, , assisted Altens crew of 11 and there was no loss of life, although Alten was badly damaged. In January 1938, Louisville began a long Pacific cruise which took her to Hawaii, Samoa, Australia, and Tahiti before returning to Pearl Harbor for fleet problems. While in Sydney, Australia, the crew of the Louisville rescued a number of passengers from a sightseeing ferryboat which had capsized and sank when most of the passengers crowded on the open top deck ran to the rail to wave the cruiser off. Nineteen of the ferry's passengers died. The winter of 1939 found Louisville participating in fleet exercises in the Caribbean. She operated in these waters until May, when she returned to the west coast. After fleet problems off Hawaii that autumn, Louisville departed Long Beach, California, for an extended cruise through the Panama Canal to eastern South America. At Bahia, Brazil, she received orders to proceed to Simonstown, South Africa. As a neutral ship, Louisville traveled the U-boat-infested waters with her American flag spotlighted. At Simonstown, she received $148 million in British gold for deposit in the United States. She then sailed for New York City, delivered her precious cargo and returned to the Pacific. =World War II= On 7 December 1941, Louisville, escorting and , was en route from Tarakan, East Borneo, to Pearl Harbor. She continued on to Hawaii, stopped briefly to survey the damage and proceeded on to California. There she joined Task Force 17 (TF 17) and steamed from San Diego on 6 January 1942, for Samoa, landing troops there on 22 January. Her first offensive operation of the war came on her return trip when she took part in carrier plane raids on 1‚Äì2 February on the Gilbert and Marshall Islands. During this action, one of her scout planes went missing and the pilot and aircrewman were lost. After a short stay at Pearl Harbor, Louisville commenced patrolling the Ellice Islands area to help protect American bases in that vicinity. Early in March she joined TF 119, a carrier force, and began operations to stem the Japanese advance down the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomons. This force steamed in the Salamaua-Lae-Rabaul sector for a number of days, making airstrikes on numerous objectives. Following this operation, Louisville returned to Pearl Harbor, proceeding from there to Mare Island Navy Yard, San Francisco, where her anti-aircraft armament was increased with additional 1.1 in and 20 mm cannon fitted. On 31 May, she steamed for the Aleutians to join TF 8 to counter the enemy forces expected to be in the area. Fortunately for Louisville, the Japanese carrier force did not locate her and the other cruisers during the attacks on Dutch Harbor, which coincided with the Battle of Midway. Her duties, during this period of Japan's strongest efforts to establish the northern end of her \\"ribbon defense\\" in the western Aleutians, were primarily those of convoy escort, but included shore bombardment of Kiska Island. On 11 November, the cruiser departed San Francisco for Pearl Harbor, continuing, after a few days on to the South Pacific, escorting several troop transports as far as New Caledonia. She then proceeded north to Espiritu Santo to Join TF 67, which was then battling Japanese forces in the Solomons. On 29 January 1943, Louisville participated In the Battle off Rennell Island, the last of the seven naval battles for Guadalcanal, after which she operated east of the island until it was entirely secured. USS Louisville at Aleutian Islands In April, Louisville steamed, via Pearl Harbor, to the Aleutians. There, as a unit of TF 16, the cruiser covered the assault and occupation of Attu (11‚Äì30 May) and participated In the pre-invasion bombardment of Kiska in July. After the latter was evacuated by the Japanese, she conducted escort of convoy operations in the northern Pacific. In August 1943 she proceeded to the Mare Island Navy Yard for an overhaul to her machinery and alterations. Louisville was in overhaul at Mare Island from 8 October until 24 December 1943. Like her sister ships her forward mast was cut down and her aft mainmast was removed and replaced with a lighter tripod just aft of the second funnel. Louisville had the camouflage measure 32-6D paint scheme added and two new mark 34 main battery directors installed. The 1.1 in AA cannon mounts were removed and replaced with several quad 40 mm Bofors mounts along with numerous 20 mm cannon. Improved radars and flagship spaces were also added. Following this work in January 1944, Louisville returned to the southern Pacific as the flagship of Rear Admiral J. B. Oldendorf, who was to command the naval gunfire support groups through the amphibious operations ahead. In the Marshalls at the end of the month, she bombarded Wotje Atoll, west of Kwajalein, on 29 January. Then the cruiser turned her guns on the airfield and troop concentrations on Roi and Namur on the southern tip of the atoll, contributing to the conquest of those islands by 3 February. During this campaign, while waiting bombardment further targets an 8-inch 55 caliber shell fired from ricocheted off the island to explode a near miss alongside Louisville starboard side causing heavy pieces of shrapnel which damaged the chiefs quarters, pierced the bulkhead, and turret No. 3 ‚Äì 8-inch gun had shrapnel damage on the tips of the barrels- no injuries. Two weeks later, Louisville led the gunfire support group into action at Eniwetok. After Eniwetok, Louisville joined TF 58, and with the fast aircraft carriers struck Japanese installations in the Palaus, in March, and bombarded Truk and Sawatan in April. June brought preparations for the invasion of the greater Marianas, and again Louisville was the leading unit in shore bombardment operations; beginning with Saipan, where she fired continuously for the first 11 days of that engagement, through the shelling of Tinian, and ending with the assault on Guam. Louisville became the first large US ship to enter Philippine waters since 12 December 1941. On October 21, 1944, while Louisville was bombarding Leyte she was hit by the kamikaze plane shrapnel killing one crewmember. On 25 October 1944, she was in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, participating in the last engagement of a battleline as the Japanese southern force attempted to force its way into Leyte Gulf through Surigao Strait. Admiral Oldendorf deployed the American battleline across the strait and PT boats and destroyers on either side of the narrow body of water, defeating the Japanese ships as they passed through the strait. USS Louisville hit by a kamikaze (Mitsubishi Ki-51) in Lingayen Gulf, 6 January 1945 Following Leyte operations, Louisville rejoined the fast carriers now designated TF 38, and participated in pre-invasion strikes against the enemy on Luzon. By the new year, 1945, Louisville was headed towards Lingayen Gulf. While en route on 5‚Äì6 January, two kamikazes headed for and scored on her. The first kamikaze on 5 January 1945 hit the No. 2 main battery 8-inch 55 caliber gun knocking it completely out of commission killing one man with 17 injured/burned including Captain Rex LeGrande Hicks. The second kamikaze on 6 January 1945 hit the starboard side signal bridge. Rear Admiral Theodore E. Chandler, commander of Cruiser Division 4 (CruDiv 4) was fatally injured helping the sailors man handle the fire hoses to put out the massive flames during the latter attack, and died of his wounds the following day. Commander (later Rear Admiral) William P. McCarty took control of Louisville and managed recovery efforts in fighting fires and restoration of equipment, for which he was awarded the Silver Star. 42 crewmen were also killed and 125 or more men were wounded. Bridge knocked out of commission at the time forced switch of control to battery no. 2 by second smoke stack. Despite extensive damage, the cruiser shelled the beaches and shot down several enemy planes before withdrawing on 9 January 1945 and proceeding to Mare Island Navy Yard for repairs. Her repairs completed on April 10, 1945, Louisville delivered Admiral Halsey's 50 officers and 100 staff to the battleship at Guam and Louisville returned to the Pacific to join TF 54 in providing gunfire support for ground forces on Okinawa. On June 5, 1945, she was again hit by a kamikaze(initially identified as a friendly plane). Four twin 20 AA cannon opened up to set the kamikaze ablaze prior to hitting Louisville which killed eight sailors on a quad 40 mm AA gun mount, injured 45 sailors, bent the number 1 smoke stack and cut Louisvilles seaplane off and left only the pontoon on the catapult. Louisville was back on the gun line by 9 June, to remain on station until ordered back to Pearl Harbor for repairs on 15 June.Anon 1946 Post-war Louisville ship's bell With the end of the war on 14 August, Louisville was again seaworthy and hurriedly prepared for postwar duties. On 16 August, she sailed for Guam to Darien, Manchuria, with Rear Admiral T. G. W. Settle on board. From Darien, where the evacuation of Allied prisoners of war was supervised, she steamed to Tsingtao, where Japanese vessels in that area were surrendered by Vice Admiral Kaneko. Louisville then escorted the surrendered vessels to Jinsen, Korea, after which she returned to China for further postwar duties at Chefoo. In mid-October, she joined the Yellow Sea force for abbreviated service before proceeding, via San Pedro, to Philadelphia, where she decommissioned on 17 June 1946 and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Remaining with that fleet for the next 13 years, Louisville was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1959, and sold on 14 September to the Marlene Blouse Corporation of New York. Louisvilles ship's bell is on display at the Navy Operational Support Center in Louisville, Kentucky. One of her main battery 8-inch 55 caliber gun turrets (Turret No. 2) damaged in a kamikaze attack on January 5, 1945, was removed and replaced. The turret was repaired, but with the end of the war it was no longer needed. After sitting for over a decade, it was taken to the Nevada Test Site and converted into a rotating radiation detector, to collect data on nuclear tests. The turret is located 86 miles NNW of Las Vegas (Lat 37.139455, Long -116.109085). Awards Louisville was awarded 13 battle stars for her service during World War II.

Walton reappeared after a five-day search. The Walton case received mainstream publicity and remains one of the best-known alien abduction stories. Skeptics consider it a hoax. Walton wrote a book about his purported abduction in 1978 called The Walton Experience, which was adapted into the 1993 film Fire in the Sky.  Abduction claims  According to Walton, on November 5, 1975 he was working with a timber stand improvement crew in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest near Snowflake, Arizona. While riding in a truck with six of his coworkers, they encountered a saucer-shaped object hovering over the ground approximately 110 feet away, making a high-pitched buzz. Walton claims that after he left the truck and approached the object, a beam of light suddenly appeared from the craft and knocked him unconscious. The other six men were frightened and supposedly drove away. Walton claimed that he awoke in a hospital-like room, being observed by three short, bald creatures. He claimed that he fought with them until a human wearing a helmet led Walton to another room, where he blacked out as three other humans put a clear plastic mask over his face. Walton has claimed he remembers nothing else until he found himself walking along a highway five days later, with the flying saucer departing above him.  Ufologists  In the days following Walton's UFO claim, The National Enquirer awarded Walton and his co-workers a $5,000 prize for \\"best UFO case of the year\\" after they allegedly passed polygraph tests administered by the Enquirer and the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO). Walton, his older brother, and his mother were described by the Navajo County, Arizona sheriff as \\"longtime students of UFOs\\". Some UFOlogists believe Walton was abducted by aliens. UFOlogist Jim Ledwith said, ‚ÄúFor five days, the authorities thought he‚Äôd been murdered by his co-workers, and then he was returned. All of the co-workers who were there, who saw the spacecraft, they all took polygraph tests, and they all passed, except for one, and that one was inconclusive.‚Äù  Skeptical reception  Skeptics consider the case to be a hoax, describing it as \\"sensationalizing on the part of the media\\" and \\"a put-up job to make money\\". UFO researcher Philip J. Klass considered Walton's story to be a hoax perpetrated for financial gain and discovered many \\"discrepancies\\" in the accounts of Walton and his co-workers. After investigating the case, Klass reported that the polygraph tests were \\"poorly administered\\", that Walton used \\"polygraph countermeasures,\\" such as holding his breath, and that Klass uncovered an earlier failed test administered by an examiner who concluded the case involved \\"gross deception\\".Sheaffer, Robert. (1981). The UFO Verdict: Examining the Evidence. Prometheus Books. p. 20. \\"APRO and The National Enquirer had arranged an earlier secret polygraph test for Travis with John J. McCarthy, the most experienced polygraph examiner in the state of Arizona. McCarthy found Travis to be attempting \\"gross deception,\\" and pronounced the abduction story a hoax.\\"Baker, Robert Allen. (1992). Hidden Memories: Voices and Visions from Within. Prometheus Books. p. 319. \\"With regard to the Travis Walton affair, this was one of the more tawdry examples of \\"true-believer\\" chicanery, sensationalizing on the part of the media, and greedy men who tried to pull off a hoax that failed.\\"Hutchinson, Mike; Hoggart, Simon. (2000). Bizarre Beliefs. Richard Cohen Books. p. 39. \\"To put it bluntly, there is nothing in the Travis Walton story to suggest anything more than a hoax.\\"Nickell, Joe. (1992). Missing Pieces: How to Investigate Ghosts, UFOs, Psychics, & Other Mysteries. Prometheus Books. p. 202. \\"A more rigorous investigation by Philip J. Klass (1989) discovered that the case was a hoax, that the lie detector test was flawed, and the abduction a \\"put- up job\\" to make money.\\" Science and skepticism writer Michael Shermer criticized Walton's claims, saying, \\"I think the polygraph is not a reliable determiner of truth. I think Travis Walton was not abducted by aliens. In both cases, the power of deception and self-deception is all we need to understand what really happened in 1975 and after.\\" Cognitive psychologist Susan Clancy argues that alien abduction reports began only after stories of extraterrestrials appeared in films and on TV, and that Walton was likely influenced by the NBC television movie The UFO Incident, which aired two weeks before his own claimed abduction and dramatized the alien abduction claims of Barney and Betty Hill. Clancy noted the rise in alien abduction claims following the movie and cites Klass's conclusions that \\"after viewing this movie, any person with a little imagination could now become an instant celebrity\\", concluding that \\"one of those instant celebrities was Travis Walton.\\"  Media and publicity  In 1978, Walton wrote the book The Walton Experience detailing his claims, which became the basis for the 1993 film Fire in the Sky. Paramount Pictures decided Walton‚Äôs account was \\"too fuzzy and too similar to other televised close encounters\\", so they ordered screenwriter Tracy Torm√© to write a \\"flashier, more provocative\\" abduction story. Walton has occasionally appeared at UFO conventions or on television. He sponsors his own UFO conference in Arizona called the \\"Skyfire Summit\\". Thirty years after the book's release, Walton appeared on the Fox game show The Moment of Truth and was asked if he in fact was abducted by a UFO on November 5, 1975, to which he replied, \\"Yes\\". The polygraph test determined he was lying.

The comedy centers on a high school populated by the clones of famous historical figures. The show's central cast includes adolescent depictions of Abraham Lincoln, Joan of Arc, Mahatma Gandhi, John F. Kennedy, and Cleopatra. The series also serves as a parody of teen dramas such as Dawson's Creek and Beverly Hills, 90210; every episode is introduced as a \\"very special episode\\". Lord and Miller first developed the series' concept while at Dartmouth College in the 1990s, later pitching it to executives at American network Fox Broadcasting Company, who ultimately decided to pass on the program. It was later purchased by cable channel MTV, and was produced between 2002 and 2003. The show's design is heavily stylized and its animation style limited, emphasizing humor and story over visuals. The Clone High theme song was written by Tommy Walter and performed by his alternative rock band Abandoned Pools, who also provided much of the series' background music. Clone High first aired in its entirety on Canadian cable network Teletoon between 2002 and 2003, later debuting on MTV. It became embroiled in a controversy regarding its depiction of Gandhi soon afterward, which prompted hundreds in India to mount a hunger strike in response. Shortly after, MTV pulled the series, which had been receiving low ratings. Clone High attracted mixed reviews from television critics upon its premiere, but it has since received critical acclaim and a cult following. In July 2020, it was announced that a reboot of the series is in the works at MTV Studios with the original creators Lord, Miller, and Lawrence returning.  Premise  Clone High is set in a high school in the fictional town of Exclamation, USA, that is secretly being run as an elaborate military experiment orchestrated by a government office called the Secret Board of Shadowy Figures. The school is entirely populated by the clones of famous historical figures that have been created and raised with the intent of having their various strengths and abilities harnessed by the United States military. The principal of the high school, Cinnamon J. Scudworth, has his own plans for the clones, and secretly tries to undermine the wishes of the Board (Scudworth wants to use the clones to create a clone- themed amusement park, dubbed \\"Cloney Island\\", a decidedly less evil intention than that of the Board). He is assisted by his robot butler/vice principal/dehumidifier, Mr. Butlertron (a parody of Mr. Belvedere), who is programmed to call everyone \\"Wesley\\" and speak in two distinct intonations. The main protagonists of Clone High are the clones of Abraham Lincoln (referred to as \\"Abe\\"), Joan of Arc, and Mahatma Gandhi. Much of the plot of the show revolves around the attempts of Abe to woo the vain and promiscuous clone of Cleopatra, while being oblivious to the fact that his friend Joan of Arc is attracted to him. Meanwhile, John F. Kennedy's clone (referred to as \\"JFK\\"), a macho, narcissistic womanizer, is also attempting to win over Cleopatra and has a long-standing rivalry with Abe. Gandhi acts in many of the episodes as the comic relief. Also on a few occasions, the characters that we see learn most of \\"Life's Lessons\\" the hard way. = Themes and style = While the clones derive many character qualities from their ancestors, much of the humor in the show comes from the large contrast between the personality of the clones and the actual values and legacy of the historical figures they are descended from. For instance, Gandhi is portrayed as a hyperactive jerk-with- a-heart-of-gold whose biggest dream is to be accepted by those around him, in contrast to his historical legacy of calm nonviolence. Abe Lincoln is similarly portrayed as weak and indecisive, completely lacking the resolve of the President whose DNA he shares. All of the clones are also given mis- matched foster parents who have little in common with them. Gandhi's parents are a stereotypical Jewish-American couple, while JFK is raised by a homosexual, interracial couple; Joan's \\"foster grandpa\\" is an elderly blind musician similar to Ray Charles named Toots. The show also includes humor based on the historical figures themselves. For example, the diner the clones frequent is called The Grassy Knoll, a reference to the JFK assassination conspiracy theory about a second shooter, dubbed \\"The Man on the Grassy Knoll\\". Other references seen are the flag at The Grassy Knoll being permanently at half mast and the car on the roof of the diner containing the original JFK's body leaning over the edge. There are pictures of assassinations hanging on the walls of the restaurant, such as the famous Currier and Ives print of the Lincoln assassination (though this version is in color and considerably more graphic than the original print). The genetic ancestors of all of the five main clones died of similarly irregular causes: three assassinations, one execution and one suicide. Other historical figure- based humor includes offhand coincidental remarks to other students, such as Abe mentioning that the clone of Napoleon is so annoying because of \\"some kind of complex\\", or Gandhi telling Catherine the Great to \\"get off her high horse\\". The show is also a parody of \\"issue\\" episodes of high-school themed comedies. Each episode is introduced as a \\"very special episode.\\" Episodes center on various social issues, including Gandhi being shunned by his school for having ADD (because of misinformation about the disorder), parodying shows which tackle AIDS awareness (it even included a special guest celebrity who tries to educate the students). Other episodes tackle drugs (smoking raisins), the environment, and underage drinking in a similarly ridiculous fashion. In a clear sign that it is parodying the high school genre, it even ends at prom: a stereotypical \\"high school show\\" ending. Even the prom is a joke however, as we learn it is only the Winter Prom. There was a running gag that creators Phil Lord and Christopher Miller wanted to include in the show \\"where Clone High ‚Äì being an exaggeration of typical high schools in teen dramas ‚Äì would have many proms throughout the year\\". Planned proms included \\"an Early Winter Prom, a Late Winter/Early Spring Prom, a Mid-Semester Prom, a Post-Prom Clean Up Prom, etc\\". The only surviving references to this joke are the Homecoming Prom in episode 6, \\"Homecoming: A Shot in D'Arc\\", and the winter prom in episode 13, \\"Changes: The Big Prom: The Sex Romp: The Season Finale\\". Another reference to the gag was deleted from episode 8, \\"A Room of One's Clone: Pie of the Storm\\".  Characters  The main characters of Clone High: Mr. Butlertron, John F. Kennedy, Cleopatra, Abe Lincoln, Joan of Arc, Gandhi and Cinnamon J. Scudworth (reclining). * Abe Lincoln (voiced by Will Forte) is a clone of Abraham Lincoln and the main protagonist. He admires his clonefather Abraham Lincoln and feels that he is struggling to live up to him. He is in love with Cleopatra and has a very na√Øve and awkward personality. Abe doesn't notice that Joan has feelings for him and unintentionally mistreats her by reinterpreting it as a sign of friendship. He later realizes his feelings for her too late. * Joan of Arc (voiced by Nicole Sullivan) is a clone of Joan of Arc and Abe's closest friend and confidante. She is an intelligent, cynical and angsty goth. She loves Abe and hates how he ignores her in order to hook up with Cleopatra. She holds liberal political views, and \\"somewhat naively support[s] every special-interest cause.\\" In the Season Finale, realizing that JFK loves her for herself, Joan begins a relationship with him. * Gandhi (voiced by Michael McDonald) is a clone of Mahatma Gandhi and Abe's other best friend. He, like Abe, is struggling to live up to his clonefather Mahatma Gandhi. As a result, he reinvents himself as a wild party animal who tries to become popular by being outrageous and practicing finger snaps. In the end he begins a relationship with Marie Curie. * JFK (voiced by Chris Miller) is a clone of John F. Kennedy and a handsome, popular, arrogant, and horny jock as well as Abe's on-and-off rival for Cleo's affections. He later develops feelings for Joan and hates how Abe treats her. * Cleopatra Smith (voiced by Christa Miller) is a clone of Cleopatra VII as well as Abe's love interest and later girlfriend. She is a self-absorbed, vain, and often mean-spirited popular cheerleader who is the object of desire for every male in the school, most notably Abe and JFK. She is also known to live with Joan of Arc due to Cleopatra's mom and Joan's grandfathers relationship. * Principal Scudworth (Dr. Cinnamon J. Scudworth) (voiced by Phil Lord) is the literally \\"mad\\" scientist and principal of Clone High, who secretly plans to use the clones as attractions for his hypothetical amusement park, dubbed \\"Cloney Island,\\" and many of the series' subplots surround him trying to find ways to accelerate his plans. He also hates John Stamos. In his spare time he makes little pirate hats from newspapers, which he collects in a drawer on his desk. * Mr. Lynn Butlertron (voiced by Chris Miller) is Scudworth's Mr. Belvedere-esque sane robotic butler and reluctant sidekick in his stupid schemes. He refers to everyone as \\"Wesley\\". * Phil Lord as Genghis Khan * Nicole Sullivan as Marie Curie * Donald Faison as Toots, Wally, X-Stream Bob, Martin Luther King Jr. and George Washington Carver * Neil Flynn as Julius Caesar, Buddy Holly, Carl, Moses, Krabby Kakes, and Glenn The Janitor * Andy Dick as Mr. Sheepman, Police Officer and Vincent van Gogh * Murray Miller as Catherine the Great * Judah Miller as Scangrade * Debra Wilson as Harriet Tubman, Eva Per√≥n, Skunky-Poo, Reporter * Sarah Chalke as X-Stream Erin, Marie Antoinette * Zach Braff as X-Stream Mike, Paul Revere * Joe Flaherty as Abe's Foster Dad  Production  Miller initially developed the show's premise while in college, initially imagining the clones would be at a university rather than high school. The series was originally developed in 2000 under the title Clone High School, USA!. \\"Original Concept Art\\", 2001 The production was overseen by Touchstone Television. It was originally pitched to the Fox Broadcasting Company, who purchased the show immediately but ultimately decided not to order it to series. Miller deemed it the \\"easiest pitch ever,\\" considering the show's use of famous figures. Following Fox's rejection, MTV purchased the program in May 2001. All the original character designs were much different from what they would become even though the characters kept the same physical attributes and appearance. Each episode was budgeted at approximately $750,000. Despite being an MTV/Nelvana Co-production, the show was co-produced with Touchstone Television, marking as Disney's third adult animated series after The PJs and Clerks: The Animated Series. In forming the show's central cast, they found themselves limited in the number of historical figures they could depict, in consideration with avoiding \\"litigious estates\\" (such as the families of Albert Einstein or Marilyn Monroe) and keeping in mind the viewership of MTV. The show also parodies teen dramas, such as Dawson's Creek, which Lord and Miller watched in preparation to create the series. The show's art design has been described as angular and \\"evocative of UPA at its best.\\" It is characterized by a flat and very stylized appearance resembling the animation used in Cartoon Network animated series from the 1990s and early 2000s, such as Dexter's Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls and Time Squad (Lord and Miller specifically cited Samurai Jack as an influence). The character designs were all done by Carey Yost, known for his work on Dexter's Laboratory, Samurai Jack, The Powerpuff Girls, The Ren & Stimpy Show, and Timon & Pumbaa. The characters and backgrounds were traditionally drawn, and frames and cels were frequently recycled. Co-creator Chris Miller explained, \\"We like the snappy pose-to-pose animation, more for reasons of comic timing than anything else. Things that aren't expected are funnier: If an anvil's going to fall on your head, it had better not take more than three seconds. That's why we like the quick pose-to-pose stuff. For scenes with more emotional content, the characters move a little slower and more fluidly\\". Phil Lord added, \\"But we never want the viewer to be paying attention to the animation, because it's there to serve the jokes and the story. We strip out extraneous movements, because we don't want to draw your eye to anything that's not part of a joke.\\" Gandhi is the most animated character on the show; he requires twice as many story-board poses as any other character. Total Drama character designer Todd Kauffman did designs for the show's intro. The series was produced by Bill Lawrence, who also produced Scrubs, Spin City and Cougar Town. Many Scrubs alumni, such as Zach Braff, Donald Faison, Sarah Chalke, John C. McGinley, Neil Flynn, and Christa Miller, provided the voices of characters in Clone High for free. Writing and voice work were done at North Hollywood Medical Center, where Scrubs was filmed. Clone High was notable for subtle jokes hidden in the animation. There is an image of a dolphin hidden in almost every episode. The use of dolphins (sounds or images) would be later featured in Lord and Miller's later work. In the episode \\"Raisin the Stakes\\", there were numerous hidden messages, which appeared to be a parody of subliminal messaging.  Controversy and cancellation  An article in Maxim Magazine depicting Mahatma Gandhi being beaten up by a muscular man sparked outrage in India. Clone High was caught in a crossfire when citizens in the country conducted internet searches on the Maxim article but also found out about the show's Gandhi character on MTV's website. This sparked an outrage in India over the show's depiction of Gandhi. On January 30, 2003, the 55th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi's assassination, approximately 150 protesters (including members of parliament) gathered in New Delhi and vowed to fast in response to Clone High. Tom Freston, the head of Viacom (owner of MTV), was visiting the network's India branch and was \\"trapped in the building\\", according to Miller. In 2014, he recalled that protestors \\"basically threatened that they'd revoke MTV's broadcasting license in India if they didn't take the show off the air\\". MTV offered a quick apology, stating that \\"Clone High was created and intended for an American audience\\", and \\"we recognize and respect that various cultures may view this programming differently, and we regret any offense taken by the content in the show\\". Miller would later recall that executives at MTV enjoyed the show, and asked for the duo to pitch a second season without Gandhi. Lord and Miller's two potential versions of a second season included one that made no mention of Gandhi's absence, and another that revealed that the character was, in fact, a clone of actor Gary Coleman all along, and the show continued as normal. \\"We pitched that, and it went up to the top at Viacom again and it got a big no,\\" he remembered.  Future and reboot series  Lord and Miller have since stated that they have \\"considered\\" a film adaptation of the series. In 2014, they explained that as they at that time were under contract with Fox, Lawrence had a television deal at Warner Bros. Television, and the rights to Clone High were owned by Nelvana/Corus Entertainment, Touchstone/the Walt Disney Company, and MTV/ViacomCBS, it would be difficult to resurrect the show. References to Clone High are present in their later productions: the duo admitted many jokes in 22 Jump Street were \\"ripped off straight from Clone High\\", and Forte also voices a Lego version of Lincoln in The Lego Movie. In a 2014 Grantland article, the two joked that \\"our entire career has just been about getting Clone High back on the air\\". In the 2018 film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, produced by Lord and Miller, a billboard appears promoting a movie titled \\"Clone College\\", starring Abe and JFK. On July 2, 2020, it was announced that a reboot of the series was in the works at MTV Studios, with the original creators of Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, and Bill Lawrence returning for the reboot. It was also revealed that original series writer, Erica Rivinoja, will serve as showrunner of the series, while also writing the pilot with Lord and Miller.  Episodes  = Season 1 (2002‚Äì03) =  Soundtrack  The previous animated MTV series Daria and Beavis and Butt-head had used then-current popular music as a soundtrack, but, in contrast, Clone High featured a wide variety of music, usually exclusive to alternative rock, indie rock, midwest emo, hardcore punk pop rock, metalcore, from mostly unknown and underground bands and musicians; a previous MTV animated series, Undergrads, had also done this. Of these include Alkaline Trio, American Football, Ritalin, Catch 22, Ilya, The Gentleman, Drex, Taking Back Sunday, The Stereo, Jo Davidson, Saves the Day, Hot Rod Circuit, Thursday, Helicopter Helicopter, Owen, Dashboard Confessional, Elf Power, Abandoned Pools, The Get Up Kids, Mink Lungs, Mates of State, Snapcase, The Mooney Suzuki, Jon DeRosa, Ephemera, Jinnrall, Avoid One Thing, DJ Cellulitis, DJ Piccolo, Whippersnapper, Matt Pond PA, Mad City and Bumblefoot. The series' other background music and original score was written and produced by Scott Nickoley and Jamie Dunlap of Mad City Productions. Nickoley and Dunlap went on to score other shows such as South Park, The Osbournes and Newlyweds.  Reception  = Initial reviews = Television critics gave Clone High mixed reviews upon its 2002 premiere. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 based on reviews from critics, the show has a score of 60, based on seven reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". David Bianculli of the New York Daily News praised the series, commenting, \\"In a year of variations and ripoffs of established themes and genres, it's a true original. It's also a cartoon, and is truly, outrageously bizarre.\\" The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Rob Owen complimented the show: \\"Yes, Clone High has the MTV-requisite sexual innuendo, but it's more clever than much of what passes for humor in prime time today. And like Scrubs, it has heart, particularly when it comes to Abe and Joan.\\" Anita Gates of The New York Times opined that \\"the dialogue isn't always exactly funny, but it's smile worthy,\\" observing, \\"the characters are intriguing in a lightweight way but could lose their appeal fast.\\" Scott Sandell of the Los Angeles Times felt the show's debut episode lacking: \\"The problem is that the first episode, which focuses on crushes and beer, doesn't quite live up to the obvious comedic potential behind the killer premise.\\" The Hollywood Reporter Michael Farkash felt similarly, writing, \\"The premise sounds intriguing, but what hatches in the first episode is a disappointing, weak strain of comic material, lacking the cunning, subversive quality of, say, South Park.\\" = Retrospective reviews = Because of the series' early cancellation in 2003, it quickly fell into obscurity, especially in the US. However, it has garnered a large fanbase and cult-following throughout the Internet. Reruns formally aired on Teletoon's now-defunct Teletoon at Night (formerly Teletoon Detour) block and also briefly aired on MTV, MTV2 and Razer (now MTV2), and Much in Canada. Heather Marulli, of the website Television Without Pity, called the series \\"a mini-masterpiece of the animated genre; an opus to the primetime cartoon\\". David Broermann, from the website Freakin' Awesome Network, gave the series an \\"A+\\", saying it has \\"some really really good character development and depth\\" and an \\"amazing soundtrack\\" He notes the fantastic use of multiple running gags keeping viewers on their toes. Currently, the show has an 8.7 rating on TV.com, has an 8.1 rating on IMDb, and is listed as #5 on IGN's \\"Reader Choice: Top Animated Series\\". Jesse David Fox of Vulture, in a retrospective piece on the series, wrote that \\"Clone High still holds up more than a decade later as a brilliantly funny, completely nuts, surprisingly heartfelt, tonally inventive masterpiece.\\"  Home media  The two-disc DVD complete series boxset was released in Canada by Kaboom! Entertainment and Nelvana. The DVD contains the complete series, including the five episodes which did not originally air in the United States.

He is best known for his humorous short pieces written over many years for The New Yorker. He also wrote for several other magazines, including Judge, as well as books, scripts, and screenplays. Perelman received an Academy Award for screenwriting in 1956. Life and career Perelman was born in Brooklyn, New York, the only son of Joseph and Sophie Perelman, who moved from one failed business to another until they found themselves raising chickens on a farm and running a dry-goods store in Providence, Rhode Island. He attended the Candace Street Grammar School and Classical High School in Providence, Rhode Island. He entered Brown University in 1921, where he became editor of the campus humor magazine The Brown Jug in 1924. Perelman dropped out of Brown and moved to Greenwich Village in New York. Perelman wrote many brief, humorous descriptions of his travels for various magazines, and of his travails on his Pennsylvania farm, all of which were collected into books. (A few were illustrated by caricaturist Al Hirschfeld, who accompanied Perelman on the round-the-world trip recounted in Westward Ha!.) Perelman is highly regarded for his humorous short pieces that he published in magazines in the 1930s and 1940s, most often in The New Yorker. For these, he is considered the first surrealist humor writer of the United States.Donald Barthelme (1982) interview in Partisan Review, Volume 49, p.185 quotation: In these numerous brief sketches he pioneered a new and unique style, using parody to \\"wring every drop of false feeling or slovenly thinking.\\"Wilfrid Sheed (1970) The flinty eye behind the humor in Life (magazine), Sep 18, 1970, They were infused with a sense of ridicule, irony, and wryness and frequently used his own misadventures as their theme. Perelman chose to describe these pieces as feuilletons ‚Äî a French literary term meaning \\"literary or scientific articles; serial stories\\" (literally \\"little leaves\\") ‚Äî and he defined himself as a feuilletoniste. Perelman's only attempt at a conventional novel (Parlor, Bedlam and Bath, written in collaboration with Q.J. Reynolds) was unsuccessful, and throughout his life he was resentful that authors who wrote in the full-length form of novels received more literary respect (and financial success) than short-form authors like himself even as he openly admired British humorist P.G. Wodehouse. While many believe Dawn Ginsbergh's Revenge to be a novel, it is actually his first collection of humorous pieces, many written while he was a student at Brown. It is largely considered juvenilia , and its pieces were never included in future Perelman collections. The tone of Perelman's feuilletons was very different from those sketches of the inept \\"little man\\" struggling to cope with life that James Thurber and other New Yorker writers of the era frequently produced. Yet his references to himself were typically wittily self-deprecatory‚Äîas for example, \\"before they made S.J. Perelman, they broke the mold.\\" Although frequently fictional, very few of Perelman's sketches were precisely short stories. Sometimes he gleaned an apparently off-hand phrase from a newspaper article or magazine advertisement and then write a brief, satiric play or sketch inspired by that phrase. A typical example is his 1950s work \\"No Starch in the Dhoti, S'il Vous Plait.\\" Beginning with an off-hand phrase in a New York Times Magazine article (\\"...the late Pandit Motilal Nehru‚Äîwho sent his laundry to Paris‚Äîthe young Jawaharlal's British nurse etc. etc. ...), Perelman composed a series of imaginary letters that might have been exchanged in 1903 between an angry Pandit Nehru in India and a sly Parisian laundryman about the condition of his laundered underwear. In other sketches, Perelman satirized popular magazines or story genres of his day. In \\"Somewhere a Roscoe,\\" he pokes fun at the \\"purple prose\\" writing style of 1930s pulp magazines such as Spicy Detective. In \\"Swing Out, Sweet Chariot,\\" he examines the silliness of the \\"jive language\\" found in The Jitterbug, a teen magazine with stories inspired by the 1930s Swing dance craze. Perelman voraciously read magazines to find new material for his sketches. (He often referred to the magazines as \\"Sauce for the gander.\\") Perelman also occasionally used a form of word play that was, apparently, unique to him. He would take a common word or phrase and change its meaning completely within the context of what he was writing, generally in the direction of the ridiculous. In Westward Ha!, for instance, he writes: \\"The homeward-bound Americans were as merry as grigs (the Southern Railway had considerately furnished a box of grigs for purposes of comparison)\\". Another classic Perelman pun is \\"I've got Bright's Disease and he's got mine\\".S.J. Perelman talks to Tony Bilbow The Listener, Volume 83 p.279 He also wrote a notable series of sketches called Cloudland Revisited in which he gives acid (and disillusioned) descriptions of recent viewings of movies (and recent re-readings of novels) that had enthralled him as a youth in Providence, Rhode Island, later as a student at Brown University, and then while a struggling comic artist in Greenwich Village. A number of his works were set in Hollywood and in various places around the world. He stated that as a young man he was heavily influenced by James Joyce and Flann O'Brien, particularly his wordplay, obscure words and references, metaphors, irony, parody, paradox, symbols, free associations, clang associations, non- sequiturs, and sense of the ridiculous. All these elements infused Perelman's writings but his style was precise, clear, and the very opposite of Joycean stream of consciousness. Perelman dryly admitted to having been such a Ring Lardner thief that he should have been arrested. Woody Allen has in turn admitted to being influenced by Perelman and recently has written tributes in very much the same style. The two once happened to have dinner at the same restaurant, and when the elder humorist sent his compliments, the younger comedian mistook it for a joke. Authors that admired Perelman's ingenious style included T.S. Eliot and W. Somerset Maugham. Frank Muir, a British expert on comic writing, lauded Perelman as the best American comic author of all time in his Oxford Book of Humorous Prose. Humorist Garrison Keillor has declared his admiration for Perelman's writing.Garrison Keillor. Happy to Be Here. Faber, 1983. Keillor's 'Jack Schmidt, Arts Administrator' is a parody of Perelman's classic 'Farewell, My Lovely Appetizer',S. J. Perelman, Fiction, \\"Farewell, My Lovely Appetizer,\\" The New Yorker, December 16, 1944, p. 2. http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1944/12/16/1944_12_16_021_TNY_CARDS_000197922#ixzz0eXA9Wj50 itself a parody of the Raymond Chandler school of tough, amorous 'private-eye' crime fiction. Irish comedian and actor Dylan Moran listed Perelman as a major influence in his December 13, 2012 interview on the WTF with Marc Maron podcast (episode 343).  Broadway and film  Perelman wrote at least five original plays produced on Broadway from 1932 to 1963, two as collaborators with his wife Laura. The first was the musical revue Walk a Little Faster, which opened in December 1932. With Ogden Nash, he wrote the book for the musical One Touch of Venus (music by Kurt Weill, lyrics by Nash), which opened on Broadway in 1943 and ran for more than 500 performances. His final play The Beauty Part (1962), which starred Bert Lahr in multiple roles, fared less well, its short run attributed in part to the 114-day 1962 New York City newspaper strike. In cinema, Perelman is noted for co-writing scripts for the Marx Brothers films Monkey Business (1931) and Horse Feathers (1932), and for the Academy Award-winning screenplay Around the World in 80 Days (1956). Along with his explicit credits, Perelman and Laura West Perelman worked as contract screenwriters for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and made uncredited contributions for films such as Sweethearts (1938). His official credits include: * Monkey Business (1931) * Horse Feathers (1932) * Hold 'Em Jail (1932) * Sitting Pretty (1933) * Paris Interlude (1934) * Florida Special (1936) * Early to Bed (1936) * Ambush (1939) * Boy Trouble (1939) * The Golden Fleecing (1940) * One Touch of Venus (1948) * Larceny, Inc. (1942) based on the Perelmans' Broadway play The Night Before Christmas * Around the World in 80 Days (1956) * Aladdin (1958), produced for television and featuring the final score written by Cole Porter  Personal life  Perelman's personal life was difficult. In 1929 at the age of 25 he married the 18-year-old sister of his school friend Nathanael West, Laura West (n√©e Lorraine Weinstein).Conversations with S.J. Perelman, by Sidney Joseph Perelman, page xiii The two worked as writing collaborators on the 1935 play All Good Americans, produced on Broadway, and both were signed by Irving Thalberg as contract screenwriters for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer the same year. They remained married until Laura's death in 1970. Perelman did not remarry. The marriage was strained from the start because of his innumerable affairs (notably with Leila Hadley). Perelman reportedly regarded children as a nuisance. His son Adam (born in 1936) committed several robberies in the mid 1950s, was accused of attempted rape, and ended up in a reformatory for wayward boys.http://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2017/12/unexpected-art- deco-h-i-feldmans-1930.html The two things that brought Perelman happiness were his MG automobile and a mynah bird, both of which he pampered like babies. His Anglophilia turned rather sour when late in his life he (temporarily) relocated to England and actually had to socialize with the English. Perelman had a problematic relationship with Groucho Marx, who once said of the writer, \\"I hated the son of a bitch, and he had a head as big as my desk.\\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/columnists/miles-kington/art-- la-carte-67738.html In the later years of Perelman's career, he bristled at being identified as a writer of Marx Brothers material, insisting that his publishers omit any mention of it in publicity material. Cultural influence Perelman was indirectly responsible for the success of Joseph Heller's novel Catch-22. When first published, this novel received lukewarm reviews and indifferent sales. A few months later, Perelman was interviewed for a national publication. The interviewer asked Perelman if he had read anything funny lately. Perelman‚Äîa man not noted for generosity with his praise‚Äîwent to considerable lengths to commend Catch-22. After the interview was published, sales of Heller's novel skyrocketed. Perelman picked up plenty of pungent expressions from Yiddish and liberally sprinkled his prose with these phrases, thus paving the way for the likes of Philip Roth. The phrase \\"crazy like a fox\\" gained currency in the 20th century after Perelman used it as a book title in 1944.http://dictionary.reference.com/cite.html?qh=crazy%20like%20a%20fox&ia;=ahdi Bibliography =Books by S.J.

Background Falkland was the son of Charles John Cary, 9th Viscount Falkland, and his wife, Christiana. He succeeded as tenth Viscount Falkland in 1809 at the age of five after his father was killed in a duel. Political and administrative career A reformer, Lord Falkland was elected to the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer in 1831. However, already on 15 May 1832, he was created Baron Hunsdon, of Scutterskelfe in the County of York, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This title gave him a seat in the House of Lords. Five years later he was admitted to the Privy Council. Falkland became Governor of Nova Scotia in 1840 after the recall of Sir Colin Campbell. He opposed the movement led by Joseph Howe for responsible government leading to Howe threatening to horsewhip him. He restructured the colony's Executive Council by including reformers in the body which had previously been a Tory domain but resisted the demand that the majority party in the legislature be permitted to form a government. Falkland's term ended in 1846. He then returned to England and held office in the Whig government of Lord John Russell as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard from 1846 to 1848. The latter year he was appointed Governor of Bombay, in which post he remained until 1853. He returned to England the same year and later served as a magistrate in Yorkshire. Marriage and family Lord Falkland married Lady Amelia FitzClarence (21 March 1807 ‚Äì 2 July 1858 London), the last unmarried illegitimate daughter of King William IV and his mistress, Dorothy Jordan, on 27 December 1830 at the Royal Pavilion. The King gave away the bride and the ceremony was performed by the Bishop of Winchester; they spent their honeymoon at Cumberland Lodge. The couple lived at Rudby Hall, North Yorkshire.

While they were often placed in the Old World warbler family Sylviidae, recent research suggests they more likely belong in the Cisticolidae and they are treated as such in Del Hoyo et al. One species, the mountain tailorbird (and therefore also its sister species rufous-headed tailorbird), is actually closer to an old world warbler genus Cettia. They occur in the Old World tropics, principally in Asia. These warblers are usually brightly colored, with green or grey upper parts and yellow white or grey under parts. They often have chestnut on the head. Tailorbirds have short rounded wings, short tails, strong legs and long curved bills. The tail is typically held upright, like a wren. They are typically found in open woodland, scrub and gardens. Tailorbirds get their name from the way their nest is constructed. The edges of a large leaf are pierced and sewn together with plant fibre or spider's web to make a cradle in which the actual grass nest is built. Species list The genus contains 13 species: * Common tailorbird, Orthotomus sutorius * Dark- necked tailorbird, Orthotomus atrogularis * Cambodian tailorbird, Orthotomus chaktomuk * Philippine tailorbird, Orthotomus castaneiceps * Trilling tailorbird, Orthotomus chloronotus * Rufous-fronted tailorbird, Orthotomus frontalis * Grey-backed tailorbird, Orthotomus derbianus * Rufous-tailed tailorbird, Orthotomus sericeus * Ashy tailorbird, Orthotomus ruficeps * Olive-backed tailorbird, Orthotomus sepium * Yellow-breasted tailorbird, Orthotomus samarensis * Black-headed tailorbird, Orthotomus nigriceps * White- eared tailorbird, Orthotomus cinereiceps Two species moved to the Cettiidae: * Mountain tailorbird, Phyllergates cucullatus * Rufous-headed tailorbird, Phyllergates heterolaemus References Bibliography * The New Student's Reference Work/Tailor-Bird * Baker, Kevin.

Commissioned in 1939, she was very active in the Pacific during World War II, earning eleven battle stars. She was deactivated shortly after the war, but was recommissioned into the Brazilian Navy as Almirante Tamandar√© in 1951. She served until 1976, and sank under tow to the scrappers in 1980. Construction St. Louis was laid down on 10 December 1936 by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, Newport News, Virginia; launched on 15 April 1938; sponsored by Miss Nancy Lee Morrill; and commissioned on 19 May 1939, Captain Charles H. Morrison in command. Inter-war period =Atlantic= Fitted out and based at Norfolk, St. Louis completed shakedown on 6 October, then commenced Neutrality Patrol operations which, during the next 11 months, took her from the West Indies into the North Atlantic. On 3 September 1940, she put to sea with an inspection board embarked to evaluate possible sites, from Newfoundland to British Guiana, for naval and air bases to be gained in exchange for destroyers transferred to the British government. She returned to Norfolk on 27 October. =Pacific= St. Louis sailed for the Pacific on 9 November. Transiting the Panama Canal five days later, St. Louis reached Pearl Harbor on 12 December. She participated in fleet maneuvers and conducted patrols during the winter of 1940‚Äì1941, then steamed to California for an overhaul at Mare Island. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 20 June and resumed operations in Hawaiian waters. Two months later, St. Louis sailed west with other cruisers of the Battle Force, patrolled between Wake Island, Midway Atoll, and Guam, then, proceeded to Manila, returning to Hawaii at the end of September. On 28 September 1941, she entered the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard for upkeep. World War II This message denotes the first US ship, USS St. Louis (CL49) to clear Pearl Harbor. (National Archives and Records Administration) [Note that this is in answer to question \\"Is channel clear?\\" and faint writing at bottom concerning the answer being held until St. Louis had successfully cleared.] On 7 December 1941, St. Louis was moored to the pier in Southeast Lock at the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. At 7:56, Japanese planes were sighted by observers on board St. Louis. Within minutes, the ship was at general quarters, and her operable anti-aircraft guns were manned and firing on the attackers. By 8:06, preparations for getting underway had begun. At about 8:20, one of the cruiser's gun crews shot down its first Japanese plane. By 9:00, two more Japanese aircraft had joined the first. At 9:31, St. Louis moved away from the pier and headed for South Channel and the open sea. 15 minutes later, her guns, whose power leads had been disconnected, were in full operating order. As the cruiser moved into the channel entrance, she became the target of a midget submarine. The Japanese torpedoes, however, exploded on striking a shoal less than from the ship. Destroyers then pounded the bottom with depth charges and St. Louis continued out to sea where she joined and , both of which also left Pearl Harbor during the attack, and a few destroyers in the search for the Japanese fleet. After failing to locate the Japanese strike force, the hunters returned to Pearl Harbor on 10 December. St. Louis turned to escorting transports carrying casualties to San Francisco and troops to Hawaii. For her success during the attack on Pearl Harbor, the ship was given the nickname \\"Lucky Lou.\\" =1942= On 6 January 1942, she departed San Francisco with Task Force 17 (TF 17), centered around , and escorted the ships transporting the Marine Expeditionary Force to Samoa to reinforce defenses there. From 20‚Äì24 January, the Yorktown group covered the offloading at Pago Pago, then moved to conduct air strikes in the Marshalls and the Gilberts before returning to Pearl Harbor on 7 February. Upon her return to Pearl Harbor, St. Louis resumed escort duty with Hawaii‚ÄìCalifornia convoys. In the spring, after a trip to the New Hebrides, she escorted , which was carrying President Manuel L. Quezon of the Philippines to the west coast, arriving at San Francisco on 8 May. The following day, she was again bound for Pearl Harbor. There, she switched to a reinforcement group carrying Marine aircraft and personnel to Midway in anticipation of Japanese efforts to take that key outpost. On the 25th, she delivered her charges to their mid-ocean destination, then moved north as a unit of TF 8 to reinforce Aleutian defenses. On 31 May, St. Louis arrived at Kodiak Island, refueled, and got underway to patrol south of the Alaskan Peninsula. Through July, she continued the patrols, ranging westward to intercept enemy shipping. On 3 August, she headed for Kiska for her first shore bombardment mission. Four days later, she shelled that enemy-held island, then returned to Kodiak on the 11th. After that mission, the cruiser continued patrols in the Aleutian area and covered the Allied occupation of Adak Island. On 25 October, she proceeded via Dutch Harbor to California for an overhaul at Mare Island. =1943= On 4 December 1942, she departed San Francisco with transports bound for New Caledonia. She shepherded the convoy into its Noum√©an anchorage on the 21st, then shifted to Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, where she proceeded into the Solomons. She commenced operations there in January 1943 with bombardments of Japanese air facilities at Munda and Kolombangara, and during the next five months, repeated those raids and patrolled \\"the Slot\\" in the Central Solomons in an effort to halt the \\"Tokyo Express\\": reinforcement and supply shipping that sought, almost nightly, to bolster Japanese garrisons. Shortly after midnight on 4‚Äì5 July, she participated in the bombardment of Vila and Bairoko Harbor, New Georgia. Her division, Cruiser Division 9 (CruDiv 9) and its screen, Destroyer Squadron 21 (DesRon 21), then retired back toward Tulagi to replenish as troops were landed at Rice Anchorage. Early on the morning of the 6th, however, the force located and engaged ten enemy destroyers headed for Vila with reinforcements embarked. In the Battle of Kula Gulf, and two enemy ships were sunk. St. Louis after the Battle of Kolombangara, showing torpedo damage to her bow Six nights later, the force, TF 18, reinforced by DesRon 12, moved back up \\"the Slot\\" from Tulagi, and soon after 0100 on the 13th, engaged an enemy force consisting of the Japanese cruiser and five destroyers in the Battle of Kolombangara. During the battle, which raged for over an hour, Jintsu and were sunk and , , and St. Louis were damaged. St. Louis took a torpedo which hit well forward and twisted her bow, but caused no serious casualties. She returned to Tulagi on the afternoon of the 13th. From there, she moved on to Espiritu Santo for temporary repairs, then steamed eastward, aft forward to protect the bow, to Mare Island, to complete the work. In mid- November, she returned to the Solomons, and from the 20th‚Äì25th covered Marines fighting for Bougainville Island. In December, she returned to that island to shell troop concentrations and, in January 1944, shifted southward to bombard enemy installations in the Shortland Islands. Then, she moved back to Bougainville to cover the landing of reinforcements at Cape Torokina. =1944‚Äì1945= On 10 January 1944, St. Louis headed back to Florida Island. In February, she again moved northwest, this time into the extreme northern Solomons and the Bismarcks. On the 13th, she arrived in the area between Buka and St. George Channel to support landing operations in the Green Islands, off of New Ireland. At 1945 on the 14th, six Aichi D3A \\"Val\\" dive bombers were sighted approaching St. Louiss group. Crossing astern of the ships, the enemy planes went out to the southeast before turning and coming back. Only five remained in the formation, which split off into two groups. Two of the planes closed on St. Louis. The first plane dropped three bombs, all near misses. The second released three more. One scored on the light cruiser, the others being near misses just off the port quarter. The bomb that hit penetrated the 40 mm clipping room near the No. 6 gun mount, and exploded in the midships living compartment. Twenty-three died and 20 were wounded, 10 seriously. A fire, which had started in the clipping room, was extinguished. Both of her scout planes were rendered inoperable, and her ventilation system was damaged. Communication with the after engine room ceased, and the cruiser slowed to . On the 15th, she survived another air attack and was then ordered back to Purvis Bay. Repairs were completed by the end of the month, and in March, St. Louis resumed operations with her division. Through May, she remained in the Solomons. On 4 June, she moved north to the Marshalls, where on the 10th, she sailed for the Mariana Islands in TF 52, the Saipan assault force. Four days later, she cruised off southern Saipan. On the 15th, she shelled the Chalan Kanoa area, retired as the landings took place, then moved back to provide call fire support and to shell targets of opportunity. On the 16th, she proceeded south and bombarded the Asan beach area of Guam. She then returned to Saipan and, on the 17th, shifted to an area north of that island where she remained through the battle of the Philippine Sea. On the 22nd, she returned to Saipan and, after screening the refueling group for two days, proceeded to the Marshalls. On 14 July 1944, St. Louis again headed for the Marianas. The next day, she damaged her No. 3 propeller and lost of the tail shaft. Nevertheless, two days later, she arrived off Guam as scheduled; and, during the afternoon, covered underwater demolition teams working the proposed landing beaches. Pre-invasion shore bombardment followed, and after the landings on the 21st, she provided support fire and call fire. On the 29th, St. Louis departed the Marianas for Pearl Harbor, where she was routed on to California for overhaul. In mid-October, she steamed back to Hawaii, trained until the end of the month, then moved on across the Pacific, via Ulithi and Kossol Roads, to the Philippines, arriving in Leyte Gulf on 16 November. St. Louis hit by a kamikaze off Leyte, 27 November 1944 During the next 10 days, she patrolled in the gulf and in Surigao Strait, adding her batteries to the anti-aircraft guns protecting shipping in the area. Shortly before noon on 27 November, a formation of 12‚Äì14 enemy planes attacked the cruiser's formation. St. Louis was unscathed in the brief battle. A request was made for CAP cover, but Japanese planes continued to command the air. At 1130, another 10 enemy planes filled the space vacated by the first flight and broke into three attack groups of four, four, and two. At 1138, a \\"Val\\" made a kamikaze dive on St. Louis from the port quarter, and exploded with its bomb on impact. Fires broke out in the cruiser's hangar area and spaces. All crew members of 20 mm guns 7‚Äì10 were killed or wounded. At 1139, a second burning enemy plane headed at her on the port beam. Flank speed was rung up and the rudder was put hard right. The plane passed over No. 4 turret and crashed out. At 1146, there was still no CAP cover over the cruiser's formation, and at 1151, two more enemy planes, both burning, attacked St. Louis. The first was splashed off the port quarter, and the second drove in from starboard and crashed almost on board on the port side. A section of armor belt was lost and numerous holes were torn in her hull. By 1152, the ship had taken on a list to port. At 1210, another kamikaze closed on St. Louis. It was stopped astern. Ten minutes later, enemy torpedo bombers moved in to attack. St. Louis, warned by a PT boat, barely avoided contact with a lethal package dropped by one of the planes. By 1236, the cruiser was back on an even keel. Thirty minutes later, all major fires were out, and salvage work had been started. Medical work was well under way: 15 were dead, one was missing, 21 were seriously wounded, and 22 had sustained minor injuries. On the 28th, St. Louiss seriously injured were transferred, and on the 30th, she put into San Pedro Bay for temporary repairs which allowed her to reach California toward the end of December. On 1 March 1945, St. Louis departed California, and at mid-month, she joined the fast carrier force at Ulithi. By the end of the month, she had participated in strikes against the southern Japanese home islands, then moved south to the Ryukyu Islands to join Task Force 54 (TF 54), bombarded Okinawa, and guarded minesweepers and underwater demolition teams clearing channels for the invasion of Okinawa. On the 31st, she put into Kerama Retto to replenish, then returned to the larger island to support the forces landed on the Hagushi beaches on 1 April. Five days later, the cruiser covered minesweepers off Iwo Jima, then resumed fire support and antiaircraft duties off Okinawa. On 18 May, she departed Hagushi for a brief respite at Leyte, and in mid-June, she resumed support operations off Okinawa. On 25 July, she shifted to TF 95, and on the 28th, she supported air strikes against Japanese installations on the Asiatic mainland. Sweeps of the East China Sea followed, and in early August, she anchored in Buckner Bay, where she remained until the end of hostilities on 15 August. Post-war =China= Post-war duties kept the cruiser in the Far East for another two and one-half months. In late August 1945, while in the Philippines, she was assigned to TF 73 of the Yangtze River Patrol Force. During September, as other ships joined the force, she was at Buckner Bay, and in October, she moved on to Shanghai. In mid-October, she helped to lift Chinese Army units to Formosa. =Magic Carpet= St. Louis joined the \\"Magic Carpet\\" fleet to carry World War II veterans back to the United States. She completed her first \\"Magic Carpet\\" run at San Francisco on 9 November 1945, and by mid-January 1946 had made two more runs, both to islands in the Central and Southwest Pacific. In early February 1946, St. Louis sailed for the east coast and arrived at Philadelphia for deactivation on the 25th. She was decommissioned on 20 June and berthed at League Island with the 16th (Inactive) Fleet through the decade. Transfer to Brazil Squadron of the Brazilian Navy. In the center, the cruiser Almirante Tamandar√©, surrounded by four destroyers. In 1951, St. Louis was designated for transfer to the government of Brazil. Her name was struck from the US Naval Vessel Register on 22 January 1951, and on the 29th, she was commissioned in the Brazilian Navy as the Almirante Tamandar√© (C-12) and served as the Fleet Flagship until 1976. She was deployed as part of the force in the Lobster War between Brazil and France. Decommissioned for the final time and placed into reserve, the Tamandare was eventually sold for scrap to Taiwan in 1980 and was under tow to the breakers yard (Taiwan) when she flooded and sank on 24 August 1980, near Cape of Good Hope, at .

The first episode of season 8, it originally aired on March 17, 2004. In the episode, the boys are transformed into Japanese warriors after they buy martial arts weapons at a local market. Their sworn enemy, Professor Chaos, confronts them and a highly stylized battle ensues. The episode's animation routinely switches from the usual cutout-and-solid-color style to a highly stylized anime theme. This was the first episode with April Stewart as the bulk of the female characters following Eliza Schneider's departure. The episode was written by series co- creator Trey Parker. In 2015, he and co-creator Matt Stone listed it as their second favorite episode of the series. The episode was rated TV-MA L in the United States. Plot At the Park County Fair, the boys come across a vendor selling \\"authentic weapons from the Far East\\" and are interested in purchasing them. Although the vendor says parental permission is required if the hopeful buyer is under 18 years old, Cartman uses this information to pretend that he, Kenny, Kyle and Stan are orphaned brothers that their parents died in a car accident (a ruse the boys have apparently successfully used \\"like twelve times\\" in the past) and successfully tricks the vendor into giving them the weapons. Stan purchases a pair of Tonfa, Kyle gets nunchaku, Cartman buys a pair of sai, and Kenny purchases (according to Cartman) the only thing he can afford, a pair of shaken-style shuriken. After showing their weapons off to Craig, they go around town pretending to be ninjas, becoming anime-like characters with their own individual superpowers. The animation style takes on an overall Japanese look and switches to a cinemascope aspect ratio whenever this happens. Butters sees them playing and wants to join but the boys refuse to let him. He goes home and becomes his supervillain alter ego, Professor Chaos, and sets off to get his revenge on the four ninjas. Cartman keeps giving himself powers so Kyle takes them from him right before they encounter Professor Chaos. Not realizing who he actually is, the boys agree to engage in battle with their new enemy. Professor Chaos gains the upper hand by neutralizing Kyle and Stan and Cartman proves no help as he prefers to use his ninja powers, which were returned mid-battle, to turn Kyle into a chicken. Kenny comes to their defense and throws one of his shuriken. The shuriken hits Butters in his eye and becomes lodged in it, which immediately brings an end to the battle and brings the boys back to their senses. Suddenly they all realize that Butters needs medical attention, but taking him to the local hospital would result in their parents finding out about their purchases. Cartman suggests killing Butters and burying him in Kyle's backyard, which the latter agrees to, scared of what is mother would do if she heard. They try to pull the shuriken out of Butters' eye themselves but when that only makes things worse, Stan and Cartman decide that the only way they can take Butters to a doctor is if they go to the local veterinarian and so, they dress Butters up like a dog. Butters after being dressed up as a dog On the way, the boys encounter Craig again and have to hide Butters in an abandoned oven so nobody sees him. Much to their chagrin, Craig has copied them and obtained weapons from the same vendor, enlisting Jimmy, Clyde, and Token as his fellow ninjas. The two ninja groups fight, but in the chaos Butters escapes. The four boys force Craig's group to help them search for Butters, threatening to tell on them if they do not. A weakened Butters makes his way to the hospital but his disguise fools the attending doctor, who sends Butters to the local animal shelter. There, the veterinarian determines that the only thing to do is to put Butters to sleep. Just before he does, though, Butters escapes again and heads for the fair; so he decides to do the same thing to another dog instead. The boys decide to dispose of the evidence and return to the fair to have the vendor refund their money, which he refuses to do. Craig and the others inform them that they have seen Butters wandering around on the other side of the fair towards an auction that all their parents are attending. Cartman decides to use his ninja power of invisibility to walk across the auction stage to get to Butters undetected and takes off his clothes. However, since nobody else knows what the boys have been up to, Cartman inadvertently ends up streaking across the stage and is unable to reach Butters, who collapses on the stage while everyone looks on stunned. The final scene shows the townsfolk protesting at an emergency meeting about the outrage at the auction. The boys are under the impression that the outrage in question is Butters' wound (which has been medically treated by this time), but it soon transpires that the real issue is Cartman's public nudity. Cartman explains that it was a \\"wardrobe malfunction\\", and the episode ends with the other three boys addressing the issue that adults are more offended by sex than by violence, allowing them to keep their weapons with Kyle suggesting that Cartman should be punished. The episode ends with a freeze-frame of the boys in Anime style posing and embarking on another adventure as they have more work to do. Production In spite of the episode's popularity among fans, series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone openly admitted in the season eight DVD audio commentary that they did not think it was a very good episode. This episode features some ninja counterparts of the original cast of characters that appears to be modeled after the video game sprites from Capcom's Street Fighter Alpha 3. And \\"Let's Fighting Love\\", a theme song that mixes Japanese and English lyrics in a style parody of anime theme songs including that of Dragon Ball Z. The song is performed by series creator Trey Parker.Audio Commentary on \\"Good Times with Weapons\\" with Trey Parker and Matt Stone, \\"South Park: The Hits, Vol. 1\\", Comedy Central Home Entertainment, 2006.

Rockefeller, as well as his public service. He was a leading exponent of business history and oral history. Early and family life and education Nevins was born in Camp Point, Illinois, the son of Emma (n√©e Stahl) and Joseph Allan Nevins, whom he later described as a stern Presbyterian farmer.Immersed in Great Affairs - Allan Nevins and the Heroic Age of American History by Gerald L. Fetner January 2004 - SUNY Press His father was of Scottish heritage and his mother German. After education in local public schools, Nevins attended the University of Illinois, where he earned an M.A. in English in 1913. He married Mary Fleming (Richardson) in 1916, and the couple had two daughters, Anne Elizabeth and Meredith. Career Nevins wrote his first book, The Life of Robert Rogers (1914) (about a Colonial American frontiersman and Loyalist) and a history of the University of Illinois (1917) during his postgraduate studies in that institution. Nevins then accepted positions with the New York Evening Post and The Nation and worked as a journalist in New York City for twenty years, as well as continued writing and editing history books. He resigned from the Nation in 1918, and the Post about a year after publishing its history The Evening Post: A Century of Journalism in 1922. In 1923 Nevins published American Social History as Recorded by British Travellers (reissued as America through British Eyes in 1957) and The American States During and After the Revolution, 1775‚Äì1789 in 1924. In 1924 Nevins resigned from the Post to become literary editor of the New York Sun and about a year later gave up that position to become an editorial writer with the New York World. Nevins continued extensive private research in the New York Public Library and published The Emergence of Modern America, 1865‚Äì1878 in 1927, and a biography of explorer John Charles Fr√©mont, Fr√©mont: The West's Greatest Adventurer in 1928. During a leave of absence from his newspaper job, Nevins spent a term teaching American History at Cornell University. As a journalist, Nevins covered the campaigns of Al Smith. After the 1928 Presidential Campaign which he covered for Walter Lippmann, Nevins grew dismayed at what he perceived as intolerance and provincialism, religious bigotry and racial prejudice in the American South, which as a historian he contrasted to religious freedom and separation of church and state that the same region had brought to the new nation in the revolutionary era.Gerald L. Fetner, Immersed in Great Affairs: Allan Nevins and the Heroic Age of American History. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2004. p. 41. In 1928, Nevins joined the history faculty of Columbia University, where he remained for three decades until his mandatory retirement in 1958. In 1931 he gave up his journalism job in order to become a full-time faculty member and in 1939 succeeded Evarts Boutell Greene (his teacher at Illinois and mentor at Columbia), as the Dewitt Clinton Professor of History. His major works during this period included: Grover Cleveland: A Study in Courage (1932, which won his first Pulitzer Prize), History of the Bank of New York and Trust Company, 1784‚Äì1934 (1934), Hamilton Fish: The Inner Story of the Grant Administration (1936, which won his second Pulitzer Prize), The Gateway to History (1938), a two-volume biography of John D. Rockefeller, The Heroic Age of American Enterprise (1940; rewritten and expanded as A Study in Power: John D. Rockefeller, Industrialist and Philanthropist in 1953). During World War II, Professor Nevins taught (as Harmsworth Professor of American History) at Oxford University from 1940 to 1941. In 1942, he published America: The Story of A Free People (with Henry Steele Commager, reworked and republished in 1954). Nevins served as special representative of the Office of War Information in Australia and New Zealand in 1943‚Äì1944, and in 1945‚Äì1946 worked in London as chief public affairs officer at the American embassy. Upon returning to Columbia, Nevins began working on a multi-volume series on the American Civil War. The first volume The Ordeal of Union (1947) won the Bancroft Prize and a $10,000 Scribners Literary Prize. In 1948 Nevins created the first oral history program to operate on an institutionalized basis in the U.S., which continues as Columbia University's Center for Oral History. In addition to publishing four more volumes of the Civil War series, Nevins reworked the Rockefeller biography to cast a more favorable light upon the magnate. In 1954 with Frank Hill, Nevins published the first of a three- volume biography of Henry Ford and the Ford Motor Company, Ford: The Times, the Man, and the Company. From May 6, 1938, until August 18, 1957, Nevins hosted a 15-minute radio show Adventures in Science, which covered a wide variety of medical and scientific topics, and was broadcast as a segment of CBS' Adult Education Series various days, usually in the late afternoon. After retiring from Columbia, Nevins relocated to California, where he worked as senior researcher at the Huntington Library in San Marino, and also returned to Oxford from 1964 to 1965. Nevins also publicly supported John F. Kennedy in the 1960 Presidential Campaign and wrote an introduction for Kennedy's Profiles in Courage. Nevins headed the national Civil War Centennial Commission, edited its 15-volume Impact series and finished the final volumes of his eight-volume series on the American Civil War. He also published Herbert H. Lehman and His Era (1963) and James Truslow Adams: Historian of the American Dream (1968). In 1966, Nevins received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. As a historian, Nevins supervised more than 100 doctoral dissertations, published over 50 books and possibly more than 1000 articles, as well as serving as president of the American Historical Association, the Society of American Historians, and the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Death and legacy Nevins died in Menlo Park, California, in 1971. He was buried at Kensico Cemetery in Westchester County, New York. The last two volumes of his Civil War series won the U.S. National Book Award in History in 1972. Historians including Ray Allen Billington compiled Allan Nevins on History (1975) to celebrate his accomplishments. His granddaughter Jane Mayer also became a journalist. The Society of American Historians awards an Allan Nevins prize annually in his honor. Published work Nevins wrote more than 50 books, mainly political and business history and biography focusing on the nineteenth century, in addition to his many newspaper and academic articles. The hallmarks of his books were his extensive, in-depth research and a vigorous, almost journalistic writing style. Subjects of his biographies included: Grover Cleveland, Abram Hewitt, Hamilton Fish, Henry Ford, John C. Fr√©mont, Herbert Lehman, John D. Rockefeller, and Henry White. The biographies cover United States political, economic and diplomatic history of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His biography of Grover Cleveland won the 1933 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography, as did his biography of Hamilton Fish four years later. Nevins also published an annotated diary of President James K. Polk, and a volume of Cleveland's correspondence spanning the years 1850‚Äì1908. =Ordeal of the Union= Nevins' greatest work was Ordeal of the Union (1947‚Äì1971), an 8-volume comprehensive history of the coming of the Civil war, and the war itself. (He died before he could address Reconstruction, and thus his masterwork ends in 1865.) It remains the most detailed political, economic and military narrative of the era. Nevins's Ordeal of the Union has a slight but perceptible pro-Union bias, just as Shelby Foote's three-volume masterwork has a slight but perceptible bias towards the Confederacy. The last two volumes jointly won the 1972 U.S. National Book Award in History. \\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1972\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-17. Nevins also planned and helped to edit a pioneering 13-volume series exploring American social history, \\"A History of American Life\\". His biographer explained Nevins' style: > Nevins used narrative not only to tell a story but to propound moral > lessons. It was not his inclination to deal in intellectual concepts or > theories, like many academic scholars. He preferred emphasizing practical > notions about the importance of national unity, principled leadership, > [classical] liberal politics, enlightened journalism, the social > responsibility of business and industry, and scientific and technical > progress that added to the cultural improvement of humanity.Gerald L. > Fetner. Immersed in Great Affairs: Allan Nevins and the Heroic Age of > American History. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2004. p. 4. =John D. Rockefeller= Nevins wrote several books on John D. Rockefeller and the Rockefeller family, including a two-volume authorized biography of John D. Rockefeller. Business journalist Ferdinand Lundberg later criticized Nevins for deferring to power and thereby misleading readers.Ferdinand Lundberg. The Rockefeller Syndrome. New York: Lyle Stuart, 1975. p. 145. By contrast, historian Priscilla Roberts argues that his studies of inventors and businessmen brought about a reassessment of American industrialization and its leaders.. She writes: :Nevins argued that economic development in the United States caused relatively little human suffering, while raising the general standard of living and making the United States the great industrial power capable of defeating Germany in both world wars. The great capitalists of that period should, he argued, be viewed, not as \\"robber barons,\\" but as men whose economic self-interest had played an essentially, positive role in American history, and who had done nothing criminal by the standards of their time.Priscilla M, Roberts, \\"Nevins, Allan\\" in In contending that Rockefeller did \\"nothing criminal,\\" in light of his central role in the Ludlow Massacre, Nevins seems to have equated non-prosecution with innocence.The Ludlow Massacre still matters, The New Yorker, Ben Mauk, April 18, 2014. Retrieved December 26, 2017. Historians and biographers who followed Nevins' lead include Jean Strouse, Ron Chernow, David Nasaw, and T. J. Stiles, chronicling the lives and careers of such figures as J. Pierpont Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and Cornelius Vanderbilt. Though these later biographers did not confer heroic status on their subjects, they used historical and biographical investigations to establish a more complex understanding of the American past, and the history of American economic development in particular. =John F. Kennedy= An enthusiastic supporter of then-Senator John F. Kennedy, Nevins wrote the foreword to the inaugural edition of Kennedy's Profiles in Courage. He also joined his friend, frequent co-editor, and Columbia colleague Henry Steele Commager in organizing \\"Professors for Kennedy\\", a political advocacy group in the 1960 presidential election. In the late 1960s Nevins and Commager parted ways over the issue of the Vietnam War, a war that Commager opposed on constitutional grounds, while Nevins thought it necessary in the Cold War against Communism. =Major books= Many of the titles are available free online here * The Evening Post; a Century of Journalism (1922), history of the NYC newspaper online * The American States During and After the Revolution, 1775‚Äì1789 (1927) online Questia edition; online free * A History of American Life vol.

Description In a recorded visual medium, a body double is used in certain specific shots to replace the credited actor of a character. The body double's face is obscured to maintain the illusion that they are the same character; usually by shooting their body at an angle that leaves their face out (such as by showing the body double from the back) or in post-production by superimposing the original actor's face over the body double's. Body doubles are most often used for shots involving a nude scene. The reasons for this vary. Actors' nude bodies may have too many physical flaws and imperfections that would show on camera, especially due to aging. Also, some actors refuse to do nude scenes, although the latter is becoming less common as many actors are now sometimes contracted to do nudity. More specific terms are often used in special cases; a stunt double is used for dangerous or sophisticated sequences. This is in contrast to a stand-in who replaces an actor for non-filming purposes such as scene arrangement and lighting adjustments. Stunt double or body double can both be used for cases where special skills are needed--anything from playing the piano, to competitive skiing. Also, if only a part of the body is shown, the term might be more specific; probably the most common is a hand double, who is used to shoot inserts where only the hand or arm is in the shot. These inserts are often shot by the second unit with a double at a later point in production primarily because it allows the main unit to use the lead actors' time more efficiently. Another common body double is the butt double, mostly used with TV, since whole-body nudity is less common in that medium. The term stunt butt is also attested, as is stunt cock. A production scene photodouble portrays a double of the lead actor for the director. A double will be seen on camera during the movie. Some of these many double-acted scenes could be long or wide establishing shots, complicated over-the-shoulder main lead actor's dialogue sequences or in quick insert close-up shots involving only showing actor's body parts. A photodouble must be able to recite his lines with the same timing as the lead actor, and also reproduce the exact physical actions in co- ordination with the other principal actors; usually, body-doubles must be of the same approximate height and weight of the actor they're replacing. The double's face is usually not seen on-camera, particularly when they don't facially resemble the actor; a wig will usually be employed if the double's hair color is different from that of the main actor. An extensively used body double, especially when used in cases where the credited actor has died, is known as a fake Shemp. Examples In some productions, a scene calls for two characters in the same shot, both of whom are portrayed by a single actor. A body double can portray one of the characters, while the credited actor plays the other, thus enabling both characters to appear simultaneously on camera. An example of this is the identical cousins on The Patty Duke Show, back view double played by Rita Walter. An unusual example of body doubling took place in the movie Terminator 2: Judgment Day. A scene requiring Linda Hamilton to appear as two Sarah Connors in the same scene was created by employing Hamilton's identical twin sister Leslie as her double. This has become less common with the digital editing currently available which can splice together multiple takes, allowing for an actor to perform as each character in separate takes that are joined together to create the image of the characters in same setting, such as with Deep Roy who portrayed the Oompa-Loompas in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The 1984 film Body Double, directed by Brian De Palma, featured a plot that hinged on the discovery that one character had in fact served as a body double for another.Williams, Linda: 'The Erotic Thriller in Contemporary Cinema', p. 86, 2005.Ann Cvetkovich: \\"Postmodern Vertigo: The Sexual Politics of Allusion in De Palma's Body Double \\" from Raubicheck, Walter, and Walter Srebnick, eds., Hitchcock's Rereleased Films: From Rope to Vertigo.

He was the grandson of Dayan Khan (1464‚Äì1543), a descendant of Kublai Khan (1215‚Äì1294), who had managed to unite a tribal league between the Khalkha Mongols in the north and the Chahars (Tsakhars) to the south. His name means \\"Golden Khan\\" in the Mongolian language.  Consolidation of power  Borjigin Barsboladiin Altan was the second son of Bars Bolud Jinong, and a grandson of Batumongke Dayan Khan who had re-unified the Mongolian nobility in an attempt to regain the glory of the Yuan dynasty. Altan Khan ruled the T√ºmed and belonged to the Right Wing of the Mongols along with his elder brother G√ºn Bilig, who ruled the Ordos. After G√ºn Bilig's death in 1542, Altan became the de facto leader of the whole of the Right Wing and was given the title, \\"T√∂sheet√º Sechen Khan\\". When Bodi Alagh Khan, the Khagan of the Mongols from the Chahar, died in 1547, Altan forced Bodi Alagh's successor Darayisung K√ºdeng Khan to flee eastward. In 1551 Darayisung made a compromise with Altan in exchange for giving the title \\"Gegeen Khan\\" to him. Altan Khan, who controlled the Ordos tumen of the Huang He or Yellow River was well placed to keep pressure on the Chinese and the Oirat Mongols in Tibet while developing both agriculture and trade.The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 15th Edition (1977), Vol. 12, p. 373. Altan Khan also founded the city of K√∂ke Khota (Hohhot, meaning \\"The Blue City\\"), now the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China.The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 15th Edition (1977), Vol. I, p. 275. There is an impressive statue of him in one of the city's main squares.  Alliance with the Gelug  Altan Khan as icon of Buddhism. Altan Khan is particularly remembered for establishing ties between Mongolia and the religious leaders of the Tibetan Gelug order. Altan Khan first invited 3rd Dalai Lama to T√ºmed in 1569, but apparently he refused to go and sent a disciple instead, who reported back to him about the great opportunity to spread Buddhist teachings throughout Mongolia.Norbu, Thubten Jigme and Turnbull, Colin M. (1968). Tibet: An account of the history, religion and the people of Tibet, p. 218. Touchstone Books, New York. (hbk); (pbk). In 1571, Altan Khan got the title \\"Prince of Shunyi\\" (Obedient and Righteous Prince) from the Longqing Emperor (March 4, 1537-July 5, 1572), the 12th emperor of China (Ming dynasty). In 1573, Altan Khan took some Tibetan Buddhist monks prisoner.Stein, R. A. (1972). Tibetan Civilization, p. 81. Stanford University Press, Stanford, California. (cloth); (paper). The emperor also gave the Prince of Shunyi's new capital a new name, Guihua, meaning \\"return to civilization\\". The prince became very interested in Gelukpa, and Beijing was happy to provide him with Tibetan lamas, Tibetan scriptures, and translations. Sonam Gyatso accepted Altan Khan's invitation to T√ºmed in 1577.McKay 2003, p. 18 Altan Khan later had Thegchen Chonkhor, Mongolia's first monastery, built at the place of the meeting.Laird, Thomas (2006). The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama, p. 144. Grove Press, N.Y. . Also, the ruler of the Khalkha Mongols, Abtai Sain Khan, rushed to T√ºmed to meet the Dalai Lama. The Erdene Zuu Monastery was built by him in 1586, at the site of the former Mongol capital of Karakorum following his adoption of Buddhism as the state religion.\\"Erdene Zuu Monastery\\" accessed 7 December 2007. This monastery is also often (wrongly) referred to as the first monastery in Mongolia and it grew into a massive establishment. In 1792, it contained 62 temples and some 10,000 lamas.Discover Mongolia Accessed 7 December 2007. Sonam Gyatso publicly announced that he was a reincarnation of the Tibetan Sakya monk Drog√∂n Ch√∂gyal Phagpa (1235‚Äì1280) who converted Kublai Khan, while Altan Khan was a reincarnation of Kublai Khan (1215‚Äì1294), the famous ruler of the Mongol Empire and Emperor of China, and that they had come together again to cooperate in propagating the Buddhist religion.Laird, Thomas (2006). The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama, p. 146. Grove Press, N.Y. . Altan Khan designated Sonam Gyatso as \\"Dalai\\" (a translation into Mongolian of the name Gyatso, meaning \\"ocean\\"). As a result, Sonam Gyatso became known as the Dalai Lama which, since then, has been used as a title ‚Äì frequently translated into English as \\"Ocean of Wisdom\\". The title was also posthumously given to Gendun Drup and Gendun Gyatso, who were considered Sonam Gyatso's previous incarnations.McKay 2003, p. 19 Thus, Sonam Gyatso was recognized as being already the 3rd Dalai Lama. Sonam Gyatso never returned to Tibet but remained proselytizing among the Mongols.McKay 2003, p. 19 The T√ºmed Mongols and their allies were brought into the Gelug tradition, which was to become the main spiritual orientation of the Mongols in the ensuing centuries. Sonam Gyatso's message was that the time had come for Mongolia to embrace Buddhism, that from that time on there should be no more animal sacrifices, there must be no taking of life, animal or human, military action must be pursued only with purpose and the immolation of women on the funeral pyres of their husbands must be abolished.Norbu, Thubten Jigme and Turnbull, Colin M. (1968). Tibet: An account of the history, religion and the people of Tibet, p. 219. Touchstone Books, New York. (hbk); (pbk). He also secured an edict abolishing the Mongol custom of blood-sacrifices.Stein, R. A. (1972). Tibetan Civilization, p. 82. Stanford University Press, Stanford California.

Within 50 years virtually all Mongols had become Buddhist, with tens of thousands of monks, who were members of the Gelug order, loyal to the Dalai Lama. When Sonam Gyatso died in 1588, his incarnation ‚Äì and thus, the new Dalai Lama ‚Äì was Altan Khan's great-grandson. Military exploits Altan Khan used his military strength to threaten the Ming dynasty of China. He led raids into inland China in 1529, 1530 and 1542 returning with plunder and livestock. In 1550 he crossed the Great Wall and besieged Beijing, setting the suburbs on fire.Laird, Thomas (2006). The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama, p. 141. Grove Press, N.Y. . In 1552 Altan Khan gained control of the remains of Karakorum, the old Mongol capital.The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 15th Edition (1977), Vol. 9, p. 601. Longqing Emperor, the reigning emperor of Ming dynasty was forced to grant special trading rights to the khanate, after signing a peace treaty with him in 1571, allowing it to trade horses for silks, which further strengthened it economically. Altan Khan was also granted the title Prince Shunyi (\\"prince who conforms to righteousness\\") from the emperor.Laird, Thomas (2006). The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama, p. 143. Grove Press, N.Y. . During his reign he made several successful military campaigns to the west against rebellious Oirats, Kazakhs, and Kyrgyz, bringing them back under his rule. Death Altan Khan died in 1582, only four years after meeting with the Third Dalai Lama. He was 74 or 75 years old at the time. Succession Altan Khan's title Prince of Shunyi was succeeded by his son Sengge D√º√ºreng who was supported by the Ming court.

London: Macmillan Publishers Ltd., 1980.  Life  Enrique Granados and Andr√©s de Segurola in 1915 Pantale√≥n Enrique Joaqu√≠n Granados Campi√±a was born in Lleida, Spain, the son of Calixto Jos√© de la Trinidad Granados y Armenteros, a Spanish army captain who was born in Havana, Cuba, and Enriqueta Elvira Campi√±a de Herrera, from Santander, Spain. As a young man he studied piano in Barcelona, where his teachers included Francisco Jurnet and Joan Baptista Pujol. In 1887 he went to Paris to study. He was unable to become a student at the Paris Conservatoire, but he was able to take private lessons with a conservatoire professor, Charles-Wilfrid de B√©riot, whose mother, the soprano Maria Malibran, was of Spanish ancestry. B√©riot insisted on extreme refinement in tone production, which strongly influenced Granados's teaching of pedal technique. He also fostered Granados's abilities in improvisation.Harumi Kurihara, Selected Intermediate-Level Solo Piano Music of Enrique Granados: A Pedagogical Analysis Just as important were his studies with Felip Pedrell. He returned to Barcelona in 1889. His first successes were at the end of the 1890s, with the opera Mar√≠a del Carmen, which attracted the attention of King Alfonso XIII. In 1911 Granados premiered his suite for piano Goyescas, which became his most famous work. It is a set of six pieces based on paintings of Francisco Goya. Such was the success of this work that he was encouraged to expand it. He wrote an opera based on the subject in 1914, but the outbreak of World War I forced the European premiere to be canceled. It was performed for the first time in New York City on 28 January 1916 and was very well received. Shortly afterwards, he was invited to perform a piano recital for President Woodrow Wilson. Before leaving New York, Granados also made live-recorded player piano music rolls for the New-York-based Aeolian Company's \\"Duo-Art\\" system, all of which survive today and can be heard ‚Äì his very last recordings. Death The delay incurred by accepting the recital invitation caused him to miss his boat back to Spain. Instead, he took a ship to England, where he boarded the passenger ferry SS Sussex for Dieppe, France. On the way across the English Channel, the Sussex was torpedoed by a German U-boat, as part of the German World War I policy of unrestricted submarine warfare. According to witness Daniel Sargent, Granados's wife, Amparo, was too heavy and couldn't get into a lifeboat. Granados refused to leave her and positioned her on a small life raft on which she knelt and he clung. Both then drowned within sight of other passengers.Daniel Sargent, quoted in Lyn MacDonald, The Roses of No Man's Land. London: Macmillan, 1980. p. 141. A photograph of the empty drifting raft is among plates between pp. 64‚Äì5. However, the ship broke in two parts, and only one sank (along with 80 passengers). Ironically, the part of the vessel that contained his cabin did not sink and was towed to port, with most of the passengers, except for Granados and his wife, on board. Granados and his wife left six children: Eduard (a musician), Solita, Enrique (a swimming champion), V√≠ctor, Natalia, and Francisco. The personal papers of Enrique Granados are preserved in, among other institutions, the National Library of Catalonia.  Music and influence  Granados wrote piano music, chamber music (a piano quintet, a piano trio, music for violin and piano), songs, zarzuelas, and an orchestral tone poem based on Dante's Divine Comedy. Many of his piano compositions have been transcribed for the classical guitar: examples include Dedicatoria, Danza No. 5, Goyescas. His music can be divided into basically three styles or periods: #A romantic style including such pieces as Escenas Rom√°nticas and Escenas Poeticas. #A more typically nationalist, Spanish style including such pieces as Danzas Espa√±olas (Spanish Dances), 6 Piezas sobre cantos populares espa√±oles (Six Pieces based on popular Spanish songs). #The Goya (Goyesca) period, which includes the piano suite Goyescas, the opera Goyescas, various Tonadillas for voice and piano, and other works. Granados was a significant influence on at least two other famous Spanish composers and musicians, Manuel de Falla and Pablo Casals. He was also the teacher of composer Rosa Garc√≠a Ascot.

U.S. one cent coin shown for size comparison. The P-38, developed in 1942, is a small can opener that was issued in the canned field rations of the United States Armed Forces from World War II to the 1980s. Originally designed for and distributed in the K-ration, it was later included in the C-ration. As of 2020, it is still in production and sold on a worldwide market.  Design  P-38 can opener measured by digital calipers. It is . The P-38 is known as a \\"John Wayne\\" by the United States Marine Corps, because of its toughness and dependability. The can opener is pocket-sized, approximately long, and consists of a short metal blade that serves as a handle, with a small, hinged metal tooth that folds out to pierce the can lid. A notch just under the hinge point keeps the opener hooked around the rim of the can as the device is \\"walked\\" around to cut the lid out. A larger version called the P-51 is somewhat easier to operate. The handle portion can also double as a makeshift flat-blade screwdriver, with limited ability because of the rather soft sheet metal used. Official military designations for the P-38 include \\"US ARMY POCKET CAN OPENER\\" and \\"OPENER, CAN, HAND, FOLDING, TYPE I\\". As with some other military terms, e.g., \\"jeep\\", the origin of the term is not known with certainty; the P-38 opener coincidentally shares a designation with the Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter plane, which could allude to its fast performance, additionally the P-51 can opener also has an aircraft namesake in the North American P-51 Mustang. One technical explanation for the origin of the name is that the P-38 is approximately 38 millimetres long. This explanation also holds for the P-51, which measures approximately in length. However, use of the metric system in the US was not widespread at this point, and United States Army sources indicate that the origin of the name is rooted in the 38 punctures around the circumference of a C-ration can required for opening. Size comparison of P-51 and P-38 openers P-38s are no longer used for individual rations by the United States Armed Forces, as canned C-rations were replaced by MRE rations in the 1980s, packed in plastic pouches. The larger P-51s are included with United States military \\"Tray Rations\\" (canned bulk meals). They are also still seen in disaster recovery efforts and have been handed out alongside canned food by rescue organizations, both in America and abroad in Afghanistan. The original U.S.-contract P-38 can openers were manufactured by J.W. Speaker Corporation of Germantown, Wisconsin (stamped \\"US Speaker\\") and by Washburn Corporation (marked \\"US Androck\\"); they were later made by Mallin Shelby Hardware inc (defunct 1973) of Shelby, Ohio and were variously stamped \\"US Mallin Shelby O.\\" or \\"U.S. Shelby Co.\\"  Advantages  The P-38 is cheaper to manufacture than a standard can opener, and is smaller and lighter to carry. The device can be easily attached to a keychain or dog tag chain using the small punched hole.  Usage  A U.S. Army C-ration with can opener, Da Nang, Vietnam, c 1966‚Äì1967. The P-38 is easily used. First, the cutting point is pivoted to its 95-degree position, from its stowed, folded position. Then, for a right-handed user, the P-38 is held in the right hand by the flat long section, with the cutting point pointing downward and away from the user, while also hooking the edge of the can through the circular notch located on the flat long section next to the cutting edge. The can is held in the left hand, and the right hand is rotated slightly clockwise, causing the can lid to be punctured. The can is then rotated counter-clockwise in the left hand, while the right hand rotates alternatively slightly counter-clockwise and slightly clockwise, until the can has been rotated nearly 360 degrees and the lid is nearly free. The lid of the now opened can is lifted, most often with the P-38 cutting edge, and the P-38 is wiped clean, and the cutting point is rotated back to its stowed, folded position. The P-38 is then returned to its stored location, whether that is dangling on a dog tag chain around one's neck, or in one's pocket if the P-38 is attached to a key ring. Left-handed users simply hold the P-38 in their left hand, with the cutting point aimed towards themselves, while holding the can to be opened in their right hand, while also reversing the sense of the cutting hand movements just described. By tradition, 38 cuts as just described were supposedly required to open a can of C-Rations. A left-handed user is at a slight disadvantage in that the tip of the thumb (instead of the lateral flank of the distal index finger) must apply the combined travel & twist forces. Righties' thumbs take only the twist force.  Similar devices  A standard issue \\"FRED\\" can opener of the Australian Defence Force. A similar device that incorporates a small spoon at one end and a bottle opener at the other is currently employed by the Australian Defence Force and New Zealand Army in its ration kits. The Field Ration Eating Device is known by the acronym \\"FRED\\". It is also known widely in its derogative term, the \\"Fucking Ridiculous Eating Device\\". Another similar device was included with British Army \\"Operational Ration Pack, General Purpose\\" 24-hour ration pack and \\"Compo\\" Composite (14 man) Ration pack rations. At one stage they were manufactured by W.P. Warren Engineering Co. Ltd, Birmingham, England. The instructions printed on the miniature greaseproof paper bag they were supplied in read: > TO OPEN CAN: > Place opener on the can with rim of can inside the slot. Hold between thumb > and forefinger and twist forward to puncture. Repeat motion until can is > open. It takes approximately 38 twists to fully open a C-ration can. Their design is similar, but not identical, to the P-38 and P-51 can openers. The Swedish army also employed a similar variant of this opener. Its official designation is M7481-021000 Konservbrytare Mini which was distributed with the notorious \\"Golden Cans\\" (Swedish field rations were packaged in metallic tins with a golden hue). In 1924, a similar device was featured in Popular Mechanics, with no mention of a military provenance. An opener similar to the P-38, but with a non-folding blade, was popular in Poland for years. It can still be found in shops as well as the butterfly-type openers.

L√©vy processes, L√©vy flights, L√©vy measures, L√©vy's constant, the L√©vy distribution, the L√©vy area, the L√©vy arcsine law, and the fractal L√©vy C curveA New Kind of Science are named after him.  Biography  L√©vy was born in Paris to a Jewish family which already included several mathematicians. His father Lucien L√©vy was an examiner at the √âcole Polytechnique. L√©vy attended the √âcole Polytechnique and published his first paper in 1905, at the age of nineteen, while still an undergraduate, in which he introduced the L√©vy‚ÄìSteinitz theorem. His teacher and advisor was Jacques Hadamard. After graduation, he spent a year in military service and then studied for three years at the √âcole des Mines, where he became a professor in 1913. During World War I L√©vy conducted mathematical analysis work for the French Artillery. In 1920 he was appointed Professor of Analysis at the √âcole Polytechnique, where his students included Beno√Æt Mandelbrot and Georges Matheron. He remained at the √âcole Polytechnique until his retirement in 1959, with a gap during World War II after his 1940 firing because of the Vichy Statute on Jews. L√©vy made many fundamental contributions to probability theory and the nascent theory of stochastic processes. He introduced the notion of 'stable distribution' which share the property of stability under addition of independent variables and proved a general version of the Central Limit theorem, recorded in his 1937 book Th√©orie de l'addition des variables al√©atoires, using the notion of characteristic function. He also introduced, independently from Ya. Khinchine, the notion of infinitely divisible law and derived their characterization through the L√©vy‚ÄìKhintchine representation. His 1948 monograph on Brownian motion, Processus stochastiques et mouvement brownien, contains a wealth of new concepts and results, including the L√©vy area, the L√©vy arcsine law the local time of a Brownian path and many other results. L√©vy received a number of honours, including membership at the French Academy of Sciences and honorary membership at the London Mathematical Society.

Canada's war tax stamps were produced by die modification. cover. North Borneo war tax overprint, 1941. A war tax stamp is a type of postage stamp added to an envelope in addition to regular postage. It is similar to a postal tax stamp, but the revenue is used to defray the costs of a war; as with other postal taxes, its use is obligatory for some period of time.  Early Spanish issues  The first war tax stamps were produced in 1874 in Spain, during the Third Carlist War. A decree of October 2, 1873, imposed a war tax on letters and stamped documents. The stamps were issued on January 1, 1874, in two denominations, 5 centimos and 10 centimos, and depicted the Spanish coat of arms along with the inscription \\"Impuesto de Guerra\\" or \\"Impto de Guerra\\". The 5 centimo value was intended for use on letters, and the 10 centimo for use on stamped documents.Westoby, p. 328. A similar set, using different colors, was issued on January 1, 1875. On June 1, 1876, after the Third Carlist War had ended, a further set of five depicting King Alfonso XII was issued. Intended to help pay off war debts, this set bore denominations of 5, 10 and 25 centimos, 1 peseta and 5 pesetas. On September 1, 1877, additional denominations of 15 and 50 centimos were added to this set. A new issue, also bearing King Alfonso's likeness, was prepared and printed for use in 1879. This issue, a set of seven with denominations of 5, 10, 15, 25 and 50 centimos and 1 and 5 pesetas, was never placed in use as a decree of February 4, 1879 lifted the war tax.Westoby, pp. 330‚Äì331. Spain also issued war tax stamps in 1897 and 1898, during the Cuban War of Independence and Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The first set, issued in 1897, contained four stamps bearing the numbers 5, 10, 15 and 20, reflecting their denomination in centimos. The war tax was not initially applied to letters, but apparently was extended to them before the end of 1897. Again, the 5 centimo value was used on letters.Westoby, p. 331. Like the earlier issues, they were inscribed \\"Impto de Guerra\\"; additionally, they were inscribed \\"1897‚Äì98\\". For the second set, issued in 1898, the inscription was changed to \\"1898‚Äì99\\". A single stamp was issued in 1898, a 5 centimo value bearing the likeness of King Alfonso XIII.Scott volume 6, pp. 130‚Äì131.  World War I  The majority of war tax stamps were produced during and immediately after World War I, primarily within the British Empire and its dominions. In most cases, they were produced by overprinting regular issues with \\"WAR TAX\\" or \\"WAR STAMP\\", though the overprint \\"WAR\\" was occasionally used (as in the issues of British Honduras).Scott volume 1, p. 812. While they were meant to pay for the war tax only, they were often applied toward postage and registration fees. The following British colonies and dominions produced war tax stamps: Antigua, Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, British Guiana, British Honduras, Canada, Cayman Islands, Ceylon, Dominica, Falkland Islands, Fiji, Gibraltar, Gilbert and Ellice Islands, Gold Coast, Grenada, Jamaica, Malta, Montserrat, New Zealand, St. Helena, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos Islands and Virgin Islands.Elias, British Empire War Tax. Canada was the first country to issue such stamps during this period, following passage of its Special War Revenue Act in February 1915. Its first war tax stamps, produced by modifying the dies of its King George V stamps to read \\"WAR TAX\\", were released in March 1915, in denominations of 1 and 2 cents. There are also denominations in 4 and 8 cents. One bank-note from the 1920s is known to have both the 4 and 8 cent, original style, war-tax stamps. The design was modified again in 1916, applying the inscription \\"1T¬¢\\" to 2 cent stamps. This indicated that the stamps carried both their face value and the tax of 1 cent, conceptually similar to a semi- postal stamp, but whose use was required rather than optional. New Zealand followed Canada's example in September 1915, becoming the second country to issue war tax stamps.Scott volume 4, p. 940. Great Britain and Australia imposed war taxes on mail, but did not issue war tax stamps; instead, they used regular stamps to pay the fees. In the United States, which also imposed a war tax following its entry into the war in 1917, the rate for a first-class letter was raised from 2 cents to 3 cents; the added cent was used to pay the tax. A special stamp depicting the allegorical figure of Victory and flags of the Allies was issued to pay this rate. After Portugal entered World War I in March 1916, several of its colonies issued war tax stamps as well. Most of these were produced by overprinting \\"TAXA DE GUERRA\\" on existing stamps, though Mozambique issued a set of two which depicted allegorical figures of History and the Republic.Scott volume 4, p. 782. The Portuguese colonies of Macao, Mozambique, Portuguese Africa, Portuguese Guinea, Portuguese India and Timor issued war tax stamps.Scott volumes 4-6.  Other war tax issues  Though many countries (e.g., Australia) imposed taxes on mail during World War II, regular stamps were used to pay those taxes. One exception was North Borneo, which issued two war tax stamps in February 1941. These were produced by overprinting \\"WAR TAX\\" on the 1 and 2 cent values of a 1939 set of regular stamps.Scott volume 4, p. 1048. War tax stamps were issued by Bahrain in 1973 and 1974, with a denomination of 5 fils.Scott volume 1, p. 540.

The last American cruiser designed to meet the limits of London Naval Treaty, she was originally intended to be a heavy cruiser, accordingly with the maximum main armament of three triple gun turrets. These were instead placed on an improved hull derived from the Brooklyn-class light cruisers, with increased armoring. This design would go on to form the basis for the later World War II-era heavy cruisers such as the s. The ship was authorized by the 1929 Cruiser Act, laid down at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in October 1935, launched in November 1937, and commissioned into the US Navy in February 1939. Following her commissioning, Wichita was assigned to neutrality patrols in the Atlantic. After the United States entered World War II, the ship saw heavy service throughout the conflict. She was first assigned to convoy escort duty on the Murmansk Run in early 1942, and supported amphibious landings during Operation Torch in November 1942. During the Naval Battle of Casablanca, Wichita engaged several French coastal batteries and warships, including the battleship Jean Bart. In 1943, Wichita was transferred to the Pacific Theater, where she remained for the rest of the war. She frequently provided antiaircraft defense for the Fast Carrier Task Force during operations in the central Pacific, including the Battles of the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf in 1944. During the latter engagement, Wichita assisted in the sinking of the Japanese aircraft carrier Chiyoda. Wichita was heavily engaged during the invasion of Okinawa, where she provided heavy gunfire support to ground troops ashore. After the Japanese surrender, the ship served as part of the occupation force in Japan and assisted in the repatriation of American military personnel under Operation Magic Carpet. After returning to the United States, she was decommissioned and placed in the mothball fleet in 1947. She remained in reserve until 1959, when she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and sold for scrapping in August 1959. Design In the early 1930s, the Secretary of the Navy, Curtis D. Wilbur, pushed for a new construction program for light and heavy cruisers.Hammond, p. 65 Wilbur succeeded in passing the Cruiser Act in 1929, which authorized several new cruisers.Hammond, pp. 109‚Äì110 Five heavy cruisers, the last of which was Wichita, were ordered between 1931 and 1934. Wichita was the last heavy cruiser permitted under the terms of the London Naval Treaty in 1930, which limited the US to 18 heavy cruisers with a maximum standard displacement of .Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 117 The ship was originally intended to be built to the design of the , but the design was reworked before construction began.Terzibaschitsch, p. 129 Instead, the design for Wichita was based on the of light cruisers. The Brooklyn design was modified heavily, to give the new ship higher freeboard and better stability, and an increased cruising radius. The secondary battery of eight guns was identical in number to the light cruisers, but was arranged to give better fields of fire. The main battery of nine guns was mounted in a new gun turret design that rectified problems discovered in earlier cruisers. Wichita was laid down at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 28 October 1935, and launched on 16 November 1937. By the time she was completed, in February 1938, Wichita was nearly over the 10,000-ton limit; as a result, she was completed with only two of the eight 5-inch guns to keep her under the displacement restriction. When the rest of the 5-inch guns were installed, it was found that the ship was too top-heavy, and so of pig iron had to be added to her bottom to balance the cruiser. Wichita was commissioned into the US Navy on 16 February 1939. Her first commander was Captain Thaddeus A. Thomson. =General characteristics= Wichita was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced at standard displacement and at full combat load. The ship had a crew of 929 officers and enlisted men. She was equipped with four seaplanes and a pair of aircraft catapults and a crane for handling the aircraft which were mounted on the stern. Wichita was powered by four Parsons steam turbines and eight Babcock & Wilcox oil-fired water-tube boilers. The propulsion system was rated at and a top speed of . She carried of fuel oil, which gave her a maximum cruising range of at . The hull was protected by a waterline armored belt composed of Class A armor that was thick amidships. It was reduced to thick on either end. The belt was backed with of special treatment steel. The Class A steel was significantly more effective than the Class B armor used in earlier cruisers; 8-inch guns had to be within to penetrate the belt, as opposed to for the earlier armor. Wichita had a thick deck, which was immune to 8-inch fire inside . The conning tower had thick sides and a 2.25 in thick roof. The ship's main battery turrets had thick faces, thick sides, thick rears, and thick roofs. The turrets were mounted on armored barbettes protected with of armor plating. =Armament= Wichita was armed with a main battery of nine 8-inch /55 Mark 12 guns mounted in three 3-gun turrets. The guns fired a projectiles at a muzzle velocity of . Maximum elevation of the guns was 41 degrees; this provided a maximum range of . Rate of fire was approximately one shot every fifteen seconds.Campbell, p. 129 The turrets allowed each gun to elevate and fire individually.Terzibaschitsch, p. 130 Her secondary battery consisted of eight 5-inch /38 Mark 12 dual-purpose guns, four in single, enclosed Mark 30 high-angle mounts, and four in open mounts. These guns fired projectiles at a rate of 20 rounds per minute. Muzzle velocity was ; against aerial targets, the guns had a ceiling of at 85 degrees. At 45 degrees, the guns could engage surface targets at a range of .Campbell, p. 139 Wichita was the first cruiser in the US Navy to be equipped with the new 5-inch /38 gun. By August 1945, the ship had been equipped with numerous smaller guns for close-range anti-aircraft defense. Sixteen Bofors 40 mm guns were placed in quadruple mounts, and another eight were in dual mounts. She also carried eighteen Oerlikon 20 mm guns in single mountings. The 40 mm guns had a ceiling of at 90 degrees elevation and a maximum rate of fire of 160 rounds per minute.Campbell, pp. 147‚Äì149 The 20 mm gun had a rate of fire of 465‚Äì480 rounds per minute; they had a ceiling of .Campbell, pp. 75‚Äì76 By the end of the war, the ship was armed with a variety of fire control systems for her guns, including Mark 34 fire control gear and Mark 13 and Mark 28 fire control radars. Service history Wichita in pre-war light gray, on 1 May 1940 Wichita departed Philadelphia after her commissioning, bound for Houston, Texas. She arrived on 20 April 1939 and took part in the dedicatory and memorial service at the San Jacinto Battle Monument and War Relic Museum. The ship left Houston on 1 May for her shakedown cruise, during which she visited the Virgin Islands, Cuba, and the Bahamas before she returned to Philadelphia for post-shakedown repairs. On 25 September, a few weeks after the outbreak of World War II in Europe, Wichita was assigned to Cruiser Division 7 in the Atlantic Squadron, based in the Hampton Roads. She conducted her first neutrality patrol on 4‚Äì9 October. After returning to port, she went into dock at the Norfolk Navy Yard for maintenance, which lasted until 1 December. On 4 December, Wichita steamed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, arriving on the 8th. There, Thomson assumed command of the newly formed Caribbean Patrol, which included Wichita and the cruiser , and the destroyers , , , , and , and Navy patrol squadrons VP-33 and VP-51. Over the course of the next three months, the force conducted a series of training maneuvers in the Caribbean. At the end of February, Wichita returned to Norfolk via Philadelphia, where she participated in further training through May. Starting in June, Wichita and conducted a goodwill cruise to South America; Wichita carried Rear Admiral Andrew C. Pickens, the commander of Cruiser Division 7. Included in the ports of call were Rio de Janeiro and Santos in Brazil, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Montevideo, Uruguay. The cruise ended in late September; the two cruisers arrived in Norfolk on the 24th.Cressman, pp. 25‚Äì31 Over the next three months, Wichita served as a training ship for Naval Reserve midshipmen and conducted gunnery practices off the Virginia capes. On 7 January 1941, Wichita departed Hampton Roads for Guantanamo, arriving four days later. She participated in fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean through March and took part in practice amphibious landings at Puerto Rico. She returned to the United States, docking at the New York Navy Yard, on 23 March. Wichita went to sea again on 6 April, bound for Bermuda; she reached her destination two days later. She then joined the aircraft carrier and the heavy cruiser for a patrol in the North Atlantic, during which the ships sailed to within of Ireland.Rohwer, p. 68 Wichita then returned to the New York Navy Yard on 17 May and went into drydock on 21 June. Repairs were completed on 2 July, after which Wichita was transferred to Newport, Rhode Island. She sortied again on 27 July bound for Iceland as part of Task Force 16 under Operation Indigo II, the occupation of Iceland. Wichita arrived in Reykjav√≠k on 6 August, along with the carrier and the battleship . The task force landed a contingent of US Army troops and fighter aircraft to provide air support.Cressman, pp. 48‚Äì49Rohwer, p. 91 The cruiser returned to the United States by 20 August. Wichita returned to Iceland in September, arriving in Reykjav√≠k on 28 September. Two days prior to Wichitas arrival, the US Navy ordered the units of the Atlantic Fleet to protect all ships engaged in commerce in United States defensive waters. The orders authorized the Navy to patrol, escort merchantmen, and attack any German or Italian naval forces encountered. Wichita was assigned to Task Group 7.5, which was engaged in patrolling Icelandic waters through the end 1941. On 7 December 1941, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, bringing the United States into World War II; on the day of the attack, Wichita lay at anchor at Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur, Iceland. =Atlantic theater= Wichita weathering a storm off Iceland. Wichita left port on 5 January 1942 for training and a patrol in the Denmark Strait; she returned to Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur on 10 January. On the 15th, a powerful storm, with sustained winds of and gusts up to , hit Iceland. Wichita was damaged by the storm, including a collision with the freighter and the British trawler . She then ran aground off Hrafneyri Light.Cressman, p. 69 The following day, the ship's crew evaluated her condition; she had suffered minor damage from the collisions, including some leaks, and damage to the hull from the grounding. Temporary repairs were effected in Iceland to allow Wichita to return to the New York Navy Yard for more thorough repairs. She arrived on 9 February, and repairs lasted until 26 February, when she left port for training maneuvers off Maine in early March. On 26 March, Wichita, assigned to Task Force 39, departed the United States to reinforce the British Home Fleet based in Scapa Flow. Task Force 39, commanded by Rear Admiral John W. Wilcox, Jr., included Wasp, the battleship , the cruiser Tuscaloosa, and eight destroyers. While en route, Wilcox was swept overboard in a heavy sea and lost. Rear Admiral Robert C. Giffen, who flew his flag in Wichita, took command of the task force.Cressman, p. 84 After arriving in Scapa Flow, Wichita and the other American ships spent several weeks training with their British counterparts. On 28 April, Wichita departed on her first major operation with the British. She was assigned to the Allied escort for the Arctic convoys QP 11 and PQ 15. The American component, organized as Task Force 99, comprised Washington, Wichita, Tuscaloosa, and four destroyers. The British assigned the carrier , the battleship , a light cruiser, and five destroyers.Cressman, p. 90Rohwer, p. 154, 162 After successfully escorting the convoys, Wichita returned to Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur, arriving on 6 May. USS Wichita and USS Wasp in Scapa Flow in 1942. Wichita sortied on 12 May to relieve Tuscaloosa, which was patrolling the Denmark Strait. Wichita returned to Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur a week later, before putting to sea as part of another Allied convoy escort protecting one leg of the movement of Murmansk-bound convoy PQ 16 and eastbound QP 12. She put into Scapa Flow on 29 May after completing the mission. While in Scapa Flow, King George VI inspected Wichita on 7 June. Wichita left Scapa Flow on 12 June, bound for Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur, and arrived 14 June. She then relieved the British cruiser on patrol in the Denmark Strait. While on patrol on 17 June, Wichita spotted a German Focke-Wulf Fw 200 reconnaissance bomber and opened fire, though without result. Three days later, she engaged another Fw 200, again without success. After returning to Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur, Wichita steamed to Seidisfjord at the end of June, where she joined Tuscaloosa and three destroyers. They were assigned to the escort for the convoy PQ 17.Cressman, p. 107 The convoy escort also included Washington, Victorious, and the battleship . The Germans organized a powerful task force, centered on the battleship and three heavy cruisers, to attack the convoy; the operation was codenamed R√∂sselsprung (Knight's Move). Swedish intelligence had meanwhile reported the German departures to the British Admiralty, which ordered the convoy to disperse. Aware that they had been detected, the Germans aborted the operation and turned over the attack to U-boats and the Luftwaffe. The scattered vessels could no longer be protected by the convoy escorts, and the Germans sank 21 of the 34 isolated transports.Garzke & Dulin, pp. 253‚Äì255 The next day, while south of Spitzbergen, the ships were spotted and shadowed by a pair of Fw 200s. Both Wichita and Tuscaloosa opened fire with their antiaircraft guns, but the Fw 200s escaped without damage. In late July, Wichita went into drydock at the Royal Navy base in Rosyth, Scotland. Repairs, which included correcting a propeller shaft vibration, lasted from 24 July until 9 August. The repairs to the propeller shaft were ineffective, however, which necessitated a return to the United States. She reached the New York Navy Yard on 22 August for repairs, which lasted until 5 September. She completed a round of post-repair sea trials before conducting gunnery exercises in the Chesapeake Bay. Wichita conducted training off the Virginia Capes for the rest of the month, after which she steamed to Casco Bay in Maine for further maneuvers. Operation Torch Wichita in a gunnery duel with Jean Bart At the end of October, Wichita was assigned to Task Group 34.1, under the command of Rear Admiral H. Kent Hewitt, who flew his flag in . The Task Group also included the battleship and Tuscaloosa.Tomblin, p. 19 The ships were assigned to provide gunfire support for Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa. Wichita participated in the Naval Battle of Casablanca, which began early on the morning of 8 November. The ships were tasked with neutralizing the primary French defenses, which included coastal guns on El Hank, several submarines, and the incomplete battleship which lay at anchor in the harbor. Wichita and Tuscaloosa initially engaged the French batteries on El Hank and the French submarine pens, while Massachusetts attacked Jean Bart. French naval forces, led by the cruiser , put up a stubborn defense.Rohwer, pp. 209‚Äì210Tomblin, pp. 30‚Äì32 In response, the French launched a pair of attacks to break up the American landings. During the first French attack, either Wichita or Tuscaloosa damaged the French destroyer and forced it aground. A second French attack was also defeated; one of the two cruisers sank the destroyer and damaged . Wichita, Tuscaloosa, and Massachusetts also engaged Jean Bart.Cressman, p. 129 At 11:28, Wichita was hit by a shell, fired by a gun on El Hank. The shell penetrated her deck and exploded below, injuring fourteen men. Hewitt broke off the attack temporarily, but by 13:12, several American warships began firing on French vessels exiting the harbor. Wichita and Tuscaloosa closed on the port to engage the cruisers Primauguet and , still in the harbor. Heavy fire from El Hank forced the American cruisers to retreat shortly after 15:00.Tomblin, pp. 37‚Äì38 For the remainder of the operations off North Africa, Wichita patrolled between Casablanca and Fedhala. Her part in the amphibious assault complete, Wichita departed the area on 12 November, bound for New York for repairs; she arrived on 19 November. =Pacific theater= and , photographed from Wichita, off Rennell Island Shortly after repairs were completed, Wichita was transferred to the Pacific theater. She was assigned to Task Force 18, commanded by Rear Admiral Giffen, and tasked with operations off Guadalcanal. She was joined by the heavy cruisers and , the light cruisers , , and . In addition, the escort carriers and , and eight destroyers were present in the task group.Crenshaw, p. 62 On the night of 29 January 1943, the Task Force was steaming off Rennell Island; wary of the threat from Japanese submarines, which Allied intelligence indicated were likely in the area, Giffen arranged his cruisers and destroyers for anti-submarine defense, not expecting an air attack. The cruisers were aligned in two columns, spaced apart. Wichita, Chicago, and Louisville, in that order, were to starboard, and Montpelier, Cleveland, and Columbia were to port. The six destroyers were in a semicircle ahead of the cruiser columns.Frank, p. 578 That evening, the ships came under attack from Japanese torpedo bombers. In the ensuing Battle of Rennell Island, Chicago was hit by several torpedoes and sunk; Wichita was hit by one torpedo, though it failed to explode.Rohwer, p. 224 Wichita then steamed to Efate in the New Hebrides for a training period. She then departed on 7 April, bound for Pearl Harbor and arriving there a week later. On 18 April, she steamed out of Pearl Harbor for Adak, Alaska, again flying Giffen's flag, for Task Group 52.10. In early May, Wichita was assigned to the amphibious force tasked with liberating the Aleutian Islands from Japanese control. She served as the flagship of the northern covering force, along with the cruisers Louisville and and four destroyers.Rowher, p. 249 On 6 July, Wichita, three other cruisers, and four destroyers bombarded Japanese positions on the island of Kiska.Rohwer, p. 260 The bombardment convinced the Japanese that the Americans intended to invade the island in the near future; they therefore planned an evacuation by July.Garfield, pp. 358‚Äì359 Wichita leading a column of cruisers bombarding Kiska on 22 July On 19 July, a powerful American fleet, including the battleships , , and Mississippi joined Wichita to conduct another attack on Kiska three days later.Garfield, 361 Five days later, malfunctioning radar equipment led to a battle with radar phantoms (the \\"Battle of the Pips\\"); Wichita, two battleships, and two other cruisers expended over a thousand rounds of ammunition from their main batteries on the empty sea. That same day, the Japanese successfully evacuated the island, which was invaded by American troops two weeks later. The morning after the assumed engagement, Wichita launched a seaplane to reconnoiter the area, but found no evidence of Japanese forces.Garfield, p. 367 Wichita participated in exercises off Hawaii for the remainder of the year. On 16 January 1944, she departed to take part in the invasion of the Marshall Islands. She was assigned to Task Group 58.3, under the command of Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman. The Task Group included the fleet carrier , the light carriers and , the fast battleships , Massachusetts, , and , and several destroyers.Rohwer, p. 306 Wichita provided anti-aircraft support for the carriers while they conducted air strikes on Kwajalein and Eniwetok on 29‚Äì31 January. On 4 February, Wichita arrived at Majuro; she was transferred to Task Group 58.2. The force departed Majuro on 12 February and conducted Operation Hailstone, a major air strike on the Japanese base at Truk, four days later. On the night of 16 February, Japanese aircraft launched an attack on the Task Group and torpedoed the carrier . Task Unit 58.2.4, which included Wichita, was detached to escort Intrepid back to safety and repairs. The ships reached Majuro on 20 February, and departed for Hawaii eight days later. The ships arrived in port on 4 March, and on the 9th, Wichita became the flagship of Cruiser Division 6. On 15 March, Cruiser Division 6 departed Hawaii to return to Majuro, arriving on 20 March. After arriving, she joined the screen for the Fast Carrier Task Force, which struck Japanese bases on Yap, Woleai, and in the Palaus. Wichita supported strikes on Hollandia in New Guinea on 13‚Äì22 April. The task force returned to the seas off Truk on 29 April for a second round of airstrikes on the port. While the carriers were striking Truk, Wichita and several cruisers and destroyers shelled Japanese targets on Satawan Island in the Nomol group of the Caroline Islands. Wichita underway in the Pacific, in May 1944 On 4 May, Wichita returned to Majuro for a month of training. In June, she returned to the fleet, which was gathering at Kwajalein in preparations for operations against the Mariana Islands. Wichita was assigned to Task Unit 53.10.8, which shelled Saipan on 13 June. The next day, Wichita bombarded Japanese gun positions on Guam, before returning to Saipan later that day. On 17 June, she joined Task Group 58.7; the force patrolled to the west of the Marianas over the next three days in an attempt to intercept the large Japanese carrier force known to be approaching. On 19 June, the Japanese carriers struck at the American fleet, starting the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Wichita contributed to the antiaircraft screen; her gunners claimed to have assisted in the destruction of two Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers. The ship was detached to cover troop transports and escort carriers off Saipan on 25 June. This duty lasted through the first week of July. Now part of Task Unit 53.18.1, Wichita bombarded Japanese positions on Guam on 8‚Äì12 July, and again starting on 18 July.Rohwer, p. 335 Wichita departed Guam on 10 August, bound for Eniwetok. She arrived three days later and remained there until 29 July, when she put to sea to join Task Group 38.1. She screened for the fast carrier task group while they launched airstrikes on Japanese targets in Palau, the Carolines, the Philippines, and Dutch East Indies. On 28 August, TG 38.1 raided targets in Palau and Morotai.Rohwer, p. 354 By mid-September, TG 38.1 provided air support for the assault on Morotai; the operation lasted until 21 September. The following day, the carriers launched an airstrike on Manila in the Philippines. Early on 22 September, Japanese aircraft launched a counterattack. At 07:34, Wichita shot down a bomber approximately 50 yards from her. She shot down another bomber at 07:45. She continued to provide antiaircraft defense for the carriers while they struck Japanese installations on Cebu, Negros, and Coron. Operations off the Philippines Wichita got underway to support a raid on Okinawa on 2 October. On 10 October, the fleet reached the waters off Okinawa and launched the strike. The following day, the fleet struck Aparri on Luzon. The fleet then raided Formosa, where they targeted Japanese airfields to prepare for the upcoming assault against the Philippines. On 13 October, Japanese bombers attacked the fleet and badly damaged the cruiser . Wichita took Canberra under tow, though she was relieved by the ocean-going tug on 15 October.Cressman, p. 262 Wichita joined the screen for Canberra; the squadron was joined by the badly damaged cruiser . The ships were attacked again the following day, and Houston was torpedoed again. Wichita left the damaged ships on 21 October, after they had successfully reached safer waters. Wichita then rejoined the fleet off Luzon, assigned to Task Force 34 under Vice Admiral Willis A. Lee. Wichita was present during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, which started on 23 October. On 25 October, the Fast Carrier Strike Force had steamed north, to attack the Northern Force commanded by Jisabur≈ç Ozawa. Wichita again screened for the carriers, which sank or damaged several Japanese carriers. Task Force 34 was detached to finish off several of the crippled Japanese ships with gunfire; Wichita and three other cruisers sank the light carrier and the destroyer .Rohwer, p. 366‚Äì367Cressman, p. 267 Wichita expended twenty-two percent of her armor-piercing rounds at the two ships, which amounted to 148 rounds at Chiyoda and 173 against Hatsuzuki.O'Hara, p. 276 In the aftermath of the battle, Wichita returned to screening for the carriers off Samar. On 28 October, she provided gunfire support to troops ashore on Leyte. Two days later, she defended against a Japanese airstrike on the fleet. On 31 October, Wichita left the area, bound for Ulithi, reaching her destination on 2 November. After replenishing her ammunition and stores, she returned to Leyte for several days, until the middle of November. Her crew detected severe vibrations in her No. 4 engine; the propeller shaft had broken and the propeller was trailing. She was therefore detached on 18 November for repairs in California, via Ulithi. While in Ulithi, divers discovered cracks in a strut for No. 3 propeller shaft; now only two screws were operational. She reached San Pedro in California on 15 December. She entered the Terminal Island Navy Yard shortly after reaching port. Repairs lasted until 8 February 1945, and by 28 February, she departed for Pearl Harbor. Wichita arrived in Hawaii on 6 March, before departing five days later for Ulithi. Invasion of Okinawa Wichita arrived in Ulithi on 20 March, and was assigned to Task Force 54 (TF 54) the next day. She put to sea to take part in the invasion of Okinawa. The ship was placed in Task Unit 54.2.3 to cover minesweepers off Okinawa on 25 March. On the afternoon of the following day, Wichita bombarded Japanese positions on the island, from 13:50 to 16:30. Japanese aircraft attacked the ships early the next morning; Wichitas gunners shot down one of the aircraft. Later that day, the ship resumed bombardment duties in preparation for the amphibious invasion. She continued to shell the island through 28 March. The next day, she retired to Kerama Retto to replenish her ammunition. The ship then returned to Okinawa later that day to cover underwater demolition teams as they cleared beach obstacles. Wichita continued to support the demolition teams the next day, as well as shelling targets ashore. On 31 March, Wichita bombarded the sea wall to create a breach in preparation for the landings. Wichita firing a broadside The invasion began on 1 April, and Wichita provided gunfire support to the landing troops on the southern beaches. At around 12:00, she left the firing line to replenish her ammunition. She resumed bombardment the following day and resupplied again on 3 April before covering minesweepers on 4 April. During the night of 4‚Äì5 April, Wichita shelled the Japanese defenders on Okinawa. The ship was assigned to join Task Group 51.19 the next day to bombard Tsugen Shima in company with Tuscaloosa and the battleships and . Japanese aircraft appeared, which forced the cancellation of the mission. Nevertheless, Wichita shelled Japanese shore batteries at Chiyama Shima that evening. Late on 6 April, an A6M Zero attempted to attack Wichita. The fighter came down through a break in the clouds on Wichitas port side. The ship's anti-aircraft gunners immediately opened fire; a burst from one of the 20 mm guns shot away the Zero's tail. The plane veered away, out of control, and dropped its bomb, which fell approximately from the ship. The Zero's wing clipped the deck before the plane crashed into the sea. Eleven men were wounded in the attack, though the ship remained undamaged.Sloan, pp. 102‚Äì103 The following day, Wichita steamed into Nakagusuku Bay to shell a coastal battery. Shells from the Japanese guns landed close to the ship, but no hits were scored before Wichita neutralized the battery. Over the next two days, the ship continued to bombard Japanese defenses on the island, until she retired to replenish ammunition on 10 April. Wichita continued to provide gunfire support throughout the rest of the month. On 27 April, a small caliber shell penetrated a fuel oil tank five feet below the waterline. After temporary repairs while still off Okinawa proved unsuccessful, Wichita returned to Kerama Retto where the damage was repaired on 29‚Äì30 April. Wichita then returned to the gun line. On 12 May, the ship was damaged by friendly fire.Cressman, p. 319 A 5-inch round struck the port aircraft catapult; shell fragments hit the shield of an antiaircraft director, killing one man and injuring eleven others. She departed the area to rest and refit at Leyte, returning to Okinawa on 18 June. Wichita continued to provide gunfire support to the troops on Okinawa through July, as part of Task Unit 2.Rohwer, p. 423 On 15 August, the ship's crew received word that the war with Japan was over. Wichita was awarded 13 battle stars for her service during World War II. =Post-War= Wichita and in Nagasaki harbor Wichita was assigned to the occupying force shortly after the end of the war. She departed Okinawa on 10 September for Nagasaki, arriving the following day as part of Task Group 55.7. Wichita was one of the first major warships to reach Japan; she was escorted by a destroyer, a pair of destroyer escorts, two minesweepers, and the hospital ship .Sloan, p. 349 Wichita was transferred to Sasebo on 25 September for four days before she returned to Nagasaki on 29 September. She returned to Sasebo shortly thereafter, and while she was there, a severe typhoon struck the area on 9‚Äì11 October. Wichita was not damaged during the storms. While at Sasebo, Wichitas crew inspected the Japanese ships and harbor installations to ensure Japanese compliance with the terms of surrender. On 5 November, Wichita was assigned to Operation Magic Carpet, the repatriation of American military personnel. She refueled in Tokyo before departing for San Francisco. The ship reached San Francisco on 24 November, where she went into drydock at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard two days later. Repairs and modifications for further Magic Carpet duty were completed by 1 December. Wichita departed for Hawaii on 6 December, reaching Pearl Harbor on 12 December before proceeding to the Marianas. There, the ship loaded servicemen from Saipan and steamed back to San Francisco, arriving on 12 January 1946. She left port on 27 January bound for the east coast of the United States; she transited the Panama Canal on 5‚Äì9 February and reached Philadelphia on 14 February. There, she was assigned to the Sixteenth Fleet and was placed in reserve on 15 July. Wichita was decommissioned on 3 February 1947 and laid up at Philadelphia. In the late 1940s, the Navy considered converting Wichita into a guided-missile cruiser, but and Canberra were chosen instead. On 1 March 1959, the ship was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and sold on 14 August to the Union Minerals and Alloys Corp.

Amnesty International said his arrest could be step forward for Haitian justice, and called for Avril to be tried for the grave human rights violations committed under his Presidency. Avril was freed on 2 March 2004, a few days after Aristide was ousted in the 2004 Haitian coup d'√©tat. =Miami= At the time Aristide came to power, Prosper Avril lived in Miami, Florida under an assumed name despite the fact that he would be easily recognizable. This high-profile also made him the target of rumors, and so when two Haitian radio journalists were assassinated during the first weeks and month after Aristide took power, Avril became the target of rumors that declared his involvement. He recounts this experience in his book, An Appeal to History: The Truth about a Singular Lawsuit.

He was in exile in Malaysia for 17 years during the secular New Order administration of President Suharto resulting from various activities, including urging the implementation of Sharia law. Intelligence agencies and the United Nations claim he is the spiritual head of Jemaah Islamiyah (also known as JI) and has links with Al-Qaeda. In August 2014, he publicly pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and his declaration of a caliphate. Biography Bashir was born in Jombang on 17 August 1938, to a family of Hadhrami Arab and Javanese descent.Preaching fundamentalism A chilling message for the infidels He was a student of Gontor Islamic boarding school in Ponorogo, graduating in 1959, before entering Al-Irsyad University, in Solo, Central Java, and graduating in 1963. After time as an activist for the Islamic Student Association () in Solo, he was elected secretary of Al-Irsyad Youth Organization, and then president of Indonesian Islamic Youth Movement (GPII) (1961), and Indonesian Student Da'wah Organization (LDMI). In 1972, Bashir founded Al-Mukmin boarding school with friends Abdullah Sungkar, Yoyo Roswadi, Abdul Qohar H. Daeng Matase and Abdllah Baraja. Al-Mukmin is located in Ngruki, near Solo, Central Java. Initially, Al-Mukmin's activities were limited to religious discussion after dhuhr (mid-day prayer). Following increasing interest, the founders expanded Al-Mukmin into Madrasah (Islamic school) and then to Pesantren (Islamic boarding school). During Indonesian President Suharto's New Order, Bashir and Sungkar were arrested for a number of reasons, firstly for actively supporting Sharia, the non-recognition of the Indonesian national ideology Pancasila which in part promotes religious pluralism. Secondly, the refusal of their school to salute the Indonesian flag which signified Bashir's continual refusal to recognise the authority of a secular Indonesian state. Bashir appealed but was subsequently imprisoned without trial from 1978 to 1982. Soon after his release, Bashir was convicted on similar charges; he was also linked to the bomb attack on the Buddhist monument Borobudur in 1985 but fled to Malaysia.\\"Indonesian cleric fights for a Muslim state csmonitor.com During his years in exile Bashir undertook religious teachings in both Malaysia and Singapore. The United States government alleged that during this period he became involved with Jamaah Islamiyah, an militant Islamist group..

Views and controversies Abu Bakar Bashir has been described as the ideological godfather of Jamaah Islamiyah,\\"Baasyir denied terrorism involved\\" . blogpanas.info even though no evidence has been made public that specifically implicates Bashir in terrorist attacks undertaken by the clandestine group. He has claimed that Jemaah Islamiyah doesn't exist and that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Israel were behind terror attacks in Indonesia including the 2002 Bali bombingsBashir links CIA to Bali bombings . ABC After open confessions from the bombers, Bashir claimed in August 2006 that the Bali bombs were \\"replaced\\" by a \\"micro-nuclear\\" weapon by the CIA. Bashir has expressed sympathy for Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, but that he didn't \\"agree with all of their actions,\\" in particular \\"total war.\\" He further stated \\"...If this occurs in an Islamic country, the fitnah [discord] will be felt by Muslims. But to attack them in their country [America] is fine.\\" He has claimed the 9/11 attacks were a false flag attack by America and Israel as a pretext to attack Muslims in Afghanistan and Iraq.Scott Atran,\\"A chilling message for the infidels\\" , The First Post, June 18, 2006. In a speech following the Bali attacks Bashir stated, \\"I support Osama bin Laden's struggle because his is the true struggle to uphold Islam.\\" the Indonesian Islamic cleric is portrayed strongly in Western media as an extremist who inspires deadly actions, He has stated his belief that Indonesia must adhere to Sharia law and has renewed his calls for an Islamic state in Indonesia. > There is no nobler life than to die as a martyr for jihad. None. The highest > deed in Islam is Jihad. If we commit to Jihad, we can neglect other deeds, > even fasting and prayer.* He founded the Indonesian Mujahedeen Council (MMI), a coalition of Islamist groups promoting the implementation of Islamic law in Indonesia. In August 2008, Bashir resigned his position as the Council's supreme leader, charging that the groups internal democratic structure contradicted Islam, and stated that he should have absolute power within the organization. Controversy surrounding Abu Bakar Bashir heightened in early 2008 after a sermon given by the cleric in late 2007. Bashir allegedly refers to tourists in Bali as \\"worms, snakes and maggots\\" with specific reference to the immorality of Australian infidels. Bashir states, > The young must be first at the front line, don't hide at the back. You must > be at the front, dies as martyrs and all your sins will be forgiven. This is > how to achieve forgiveness... As described by Natasha Robinson, 2008 Bashir has returned to his hardline rhetoric. His early release from prison has been described as the catalyst to his revitalised, hardline approach towards non-Muslims. Bashir's view on non- Muslims is highlighted in this statement made in East Java in 2006, \\"God willing, there are none here, if there were infidels here, just beat them up. Do not tolerate them.\\" Bashir's specific mention of Australian tourists has created uproar among government officials and the Australian media regarding the cleric's intolerant comments. Australia's Foreign Affairs Minister Stephen Smith views Bashir's comments in late 2007 as being full of the intolerance that has marked many of Bashir's previous speeches. The cleric has also previously warned of severe retribution if the Bali bombers, who killed 202 people in 2002, be executed by firing squad. On 24 March 2008 the bombers, who were on death row, lost almost any hope of escaping the death penalty as their lawyer, Fahmi Bachmid, withdrew from their last appeal.Michelmore, Karen: The Mercury, page 4, 2005 The Bali bombers were executed by firing squad at 12:15 am on 9 November 2008. In July 2014, an imprisoned Bashir pledged allegiance, or Bay'ah, to the militant Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.The Hill: \\"Six places ISIS might be\\" by Kristina Wong September 7, 2014 Arrest and trial In June 2002, the USA government asked Indonesia to turn over Omar Al-Faruq. Megawati's administration captured Al-Faruq and transferred him to American custody, and he was subsequently held in Bagram prison in Afghanistan. Similarly, US State Department translator Fred Burks revealed during Bashir's trial in Indonesia that the USA government had asked President Megawati secretly to hand-over Bashir in a meeting at Megawati's home in September 2002.Fool Me Twice (2008), 1:21:11 Present at that meeting was US ambassador to Indonesia Ralph L. Boyce, National Security Council official Karen Brooks, and an unnamed CIA official. Megawati refused to transfer Bashir saying, \\"I can't render somebody like him. People will find out\\". On 14 April 2003, he was formally charged by the Indonesian government with treason, immigration violations, and providing false documents and statements to the Indonesian police. The charges are mainly related to the 2000 Christmas Eve bombings against Christian churches, which killed 18 people. In the Indonesian court, he was found not guilty of treason because the state failed to prove its case, but was found guilty on the immigration violations. In a local TV news interview, Metro TV, when asked, 'Are you truly a terrorist?'; He simply answered, 'No, I've never killed anyone.' He was sentenced to three years in prison, but the sentence was subsequently reduced to 20 months due to his good behavior in the prison. On 15 October 2004, he was arrested by the Indonesian authorities and charged with involvement in the bomb attack on the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta on 5 August 2003, which killed 14 people. Secondary charges in the same indictment charge him of involvement in the 2002 Bali bombing, the first time he has faced charges in relation to that attack which killed 202 people. On March 3, 2005, Bashir was found guilty of conspiracy over the 2002 attacks, but was found not guilty of the charges surrounding the 2003 bombing. He was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment. Remission and release On 17 August 2005, as part of the tradition of remissions for Indonesia's Independence Day, Bashir's jail term was cut by 4 months and 15 days. On 14 June 2006, to cheers from his supporters waiting outside, Abu Bakar Bashir was released, having served 25+ months in Jakarta's Cipinang prison, where he held court and coordinated the publication of a commemorative book with his release. About forty bodyguards in uniform black jackets linked arms to escort Bashir through chanting crowds. After returning to the boarding school for which he is the spiritual leader, he pledged a renewed campaign to impose Islamic sharia law on Indonesia. He also called Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, to convert to Islam in order to save him from hell and receive God's forgiveness.Howard should convert to Islam: Bashir by Geoff Thompson, ABC Online, June 15, 2006 Howard said that Australians would be \\"extremely disappointed, even distressed\\" at the news of the release.Australia angry as cleric freed, BBC News, June 14, 2006 In August 2006, Bashir claimed that the 2002 Bali bombs were replaced by the American CIA with a \\"micro-nuclear\\" weapon. He also claimed the original bombs were only intended to injure people, not kill them - despite the bombers' own admissions and public testimony. Australian Broadcasting Corporation In answer to one reporter's question as to what the West and the United States can do to make the world safer, Bashir replied, \\"They have to stop fighting Islam. That's impossible because it is sunnatullah [destiny, a law of nature], as Allah has said in the Koran. If they want to have peace, they have to accept to be governed by Islam.\\" On December 21, 2006, Bashir's conviction was overturned by Indonesia's Supreme Court. He publicly criticised the United Nations because he remained on the body's list of international terrorists, saying \\"I am terrorist number 35 on the list.\\" In October 2008, Bashir announced he intends to start a new Islamic group in Indonesia, JAT or Jamaah Ansharut Tauhid (\\"partisans of the oneness of God\\"), at the time the Indonesian government was preparing to execute the three Bali bombers. Bashir repeated his claim that a nuclear device was released by the CIA, saying the attack was conspiracy between \\"America, Australia and the Jews\\" In February 2012, the US Department of State website stated that JAT was responsible for multiple coordinated attacks against innocent civilians, police and military personnel in Indonesia. \\"JAT has robbed banks and carried out other illicit activities to fund the purchase of assault weapons, pistols and bomb-making materials\\", so JAT is put on US terror list. 2010 Arrest On 13 December 2010, Indonesian police charged Bashir with involvement in plans of terror and military training in Aceh. The charge against him of inciting others to commit terrorism, carries the death penalty. In February 2011, Bashir denied the charges of terrorism against him. =Conviction= On 16 June 2011, Bashir was convicted of supporting a jihadi training camp following a four-month trial. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison. He was acquitted of the charge of involvement in the 2002 Bali bombings. However, after an appeal the Jakarta High Court reduced his sentence to nine years. Finally, the Supreme Court has rejected the appeal of Abu Bakar Bashir and annulled the Jakarta High Court sentence then reinstated the South Jakarta District Court's original 15-year sentence. =Talks of release= In January 2019 it was rumoured that president Joko Widodo was considering the release of Bashir due to old age and declining health. The move was seen as controversial in Indonesia as part of a growing number of actions taken by Widodo to appease Indonesia's conservative Muslims ahead of the 2019 presidential election. However on 23 January the move to release Bashir was cancelled as he refused to pledge allegiance to the state ideology of Pancasila which was one of the terms of his release.

It is co-organized by the Hong Kong Association for Computer Education (HKACE) and the Hong Kong Education Bureau (EDB). It serves as a preliminary contest to international, national and regional competitions such as the China National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI) and the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). The first HKOI was held in 1997. History Hong Kong first participated in IOI in 1992. In order select representatives for the Hong Kong Delegation Team, a selection test was held a few months before the competition. In the next few years, Hong Kong started sending teams to other competitions, including the SEARCC International Schools' Software Competition (ISSC) in 1993, the Software Competition for the Youths (SCY) in 1994 and the China National Olympiad in Informatics in 1995. Selection tests were separately administered for these competitions, and the purpose of each test was solely to select team members for the competitions. A considerable amount of resources were used to organize these tests. The tests were not very popular among students in Hong Kong. In 1996, the Hong Kong Association for Computer Education, the Hong Kong Computer Society and the Education Department of Hong Kong (now the Education Bureau) jointly organized the Joint Selection Contest to replace all the selection tests. 39 students were selected as seeds for the Hong Kong teams. They received intensive training on topics like data structures and algorithms. After that, a Team Formation Test was conducted to select the Hong Kong representatives in IOI and NOI among the seeds. Another Team Formation Test was conducted for the SEARCC-ISSC and SCY. In 1997, the Joint Selection Contest was renamed as the Hong Kong Olympiad in Informatics. Prizes are awarded to students with good results in HKOI, who are then invited to join the HKOI Training Team. Due to the limit on the number of participants from each school, some schools organize their own team formation test to select students to take part in HKOI. Structure of the Competition =Groupings= The participants of HKOI are divided into two groups. The Junior Group consists of students aged 17 or below, and the Senior Group consists of students aged 19 or below. The rationale of having two groups with one having an age limit of 17 is that SEARCC-ISSC requires all participants to be aged 17 or below. Another advantage of having a Junior Group is to allow more young students to enter the HKOI training team without having to compete with the more experienced senior students. =Competition Format= The competition format of the HKOI has changed a few times since the introduction of Joint Selection Contest in 1996. The Joint Selection Contest was conducted in written format. All programs were written down on the answer sheet. It was difficult for both participants and markers. The participants could not rely on a computer to verify the correctness of their programs, while the markers had to read every line of the program and try to understand the underlying algorithm. In 1997, the competition was split into the heat and final event. The heat event consists of a written paper. Outstanding students in the heat event proceed to enter the 2-hour final event, which consists of programming tasks similar to those in IOI. The heat event was essential due to the limited number of computers provided for the final event. However, this change in the competition format did not eliminate the need for marking based on hand- written programs. In 1998, the heat event was replaced by a pre-competition assessment. All participants were asked to work on the pre-competition assessment task and submit a floppy diskette containing the source code and executable of their programs. The list of finalist were determined solely by the programs submitted. However, it raised concerns about the fairness of the competition, since there is no way to ensure that the submitted program was really written by the participant. At that time, the only programming language allowed was Pascal. In 1999, the heat event was reinstalled. This time, the heat event consisted of a single paper of Multiple choice problems to improve the efficiency in marking papers. This was important as the number of participants had increased to several hundred students. In 2000, the duration of the final event increased to 3 hours. In 2003, Fill-in-the-blank problems were added to the heat event, aiming to add a new dimension to the question paper. In 2004, C and C++ were added to the list of allowed programming languages. As of 2009, the competition consists of a heat event with Multiple Choice and Fill-in-the-blanks problems, while the final event consists of 5 programming tasks to be solved in 3 hours. The programming languages allowed are Pascal, C and C++. Different sets of problem are used for junior and senior group respectively. Since 2015/16, the number of tasks is reduced to 4 (no more question 0, ie. enumeration), and the format are more like IOI (batch score and real time feedback). =Awards= About half of the finalists are awarded prizes. Prizes are awarded in Gold, Silver and Bronze, in the ratio of approximately 1:2:3. Only the performance in the final event is considered. Students in junior group and senior group are ranked separately. Prize winners are invited to join the HKOI Training Team for intensive training. A Team Formation Test is usually held at around May to select delegates for IOI and NOI. Important people * Poon Wing-chi, Irwin.

Body weight is reduced to less than 62% of the normal (expected) body weight for the age.Appleton & Vanbergen, Metabolism and Nutrition, Medicine Crash Course 4th ed. Moseby (London: 2013) p.130 Marasmus occurrence increases prior to age 1, whereas kwashiorkor occurrence increases after 18 months. It can be distinguished from kwashiorkor in that kwashiorkor is protein deficiency with adequate energy intake whereas marasmus is inadequate energy intake in all forms, including protein. This clear-cut separation of marasmus and kwashiorkor is however not always clinically evident as kwashiorkor is often seen in a context of insufficient caloric intake, and mixed clinical pictures, called marasmic kwashiorkor, are possible. Protein wasting in kwashiorkor generally leads to edema and ascites, while muscular wasting and loss of subcutaneous fat are the main clinical signs of marasmus. The prognosis is better than it is for kwashiorkor but half of severely malnourished children die due to unavailability of adequate treatment. The word ‚Äúmarasmus‚Äù comes from the Greek ŒºŒ±œÅŒ±œÉŒºœåœÇ marasmos (\\"withering\\"). Signs and symptoms Buchenwald inmates, 16 April 1945 when camp was liberated Marasmus is commonly represented by a shrunken, wasted appearance, loss of muscle mass and subcutaneous fat mass. Buttocks and upper limb muscle groups are usually more affected than others. Edema is not a sign of marasmus and is present in only kwashiorkor and marasmic kwashiorkor. Other symptoms of marasmus include unusual body temperature (hypothermia, pyrexia); anemia; dehydration (as characterized with consistent thirst and shrunken eyes); hypovolemic shock (weak radial pulse; cold extremities; decreased consciousness); tachypnea (pneumonia, heart failure); abdominal manifestations (distension, decreased or metallic bowel sounds; large or small liver; blood or mucus in the stools), ocular manifestations (corneal lesions associated with vitamin A deficiency); dermal manifestations (evidence of infection, purpura, and ear, nose, and throat symptoms (otitis, rhinitis). Dry skin and brittle hair are also symptoms of marasmus. Marasmus can also make children short-tempered and irritable. Causes Marasmus is caused by the following factors: Treatment Both the causes and complications of the disorder must be treated, including infections, dehydration, and circulation disorders, which are frequently lethal and lead to high mortality if ignored. Initially, the child is fed dried skim milk that has been mixed with boiled water. Once the child tolerates the milk, a vegetable mix can be added including sesame, casein, and sugar. Refeeding must be done slowly to avoid refeeding syndrome. Once children start to recover, they should have more balanced diets which meet their nutritional needs. Children with marasmus commonly develop infections and are consequently treated with antibiotics or other medications. Ultimately, marasmus can progress to the point of no return when the body's ability for protein synthesis is lost. At this point, attempts to correct the disorder by giving food or protein are futile. Epidemiology United States In the United States, marasmus is rarely seen, especially in children. In 1995, there were only 228 deaths caused by marasmus in the U.S., of which only 3 were children. In 2016, the prevalence of marasmus in the United States was 0.5%. Prevalence is higher in hospitalized children, especially ones with chronic illnesses, however an exact incidence of nonfatal marasmus is not known. This is due to marasmus not being reported as an admission or discharge diagnosis. International There are multiple forms of malnutrition and roughly 1/3 of the world‚Äôs population is currently experiencing one or more of them. There are around 50 million children less than 5 years old who have protein- energy malnutrition. Of the malnourished children population in the world, 80% live in Asia, 15% in Africa, and 5% in Latin America. It is estimated that the prevalence of acute malnutrition in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States to be 6.1-14%. In Turkey, the prevalence is as high as 32%. Race There is no evident racial predisposition that correlates to malnutrition. Rather, there is a strong association with the geographic distribution of poverty. Age Marasmus is more commonly seen in children under the age of 5 due to that age range being characterized as one that has an increase in energy need and susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections. The World Health Organization also identifies the elderly as another population that is vulnerable to malnutrition. Because their nutritional requirement is not well defined, attempts to provide them with the necessary nutrition becomes difficult. There exists screening tools and tests that can be used to help identify signs and symptoms of malnutrition in older adults. The Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST) is a validated malnutrition screening tool that is primarily used in the residential aged care facility or for adults in the inpatient/outpatient hospital setting. It includes parameters such as weight loss and appetite. Disability-adjusted life year for protein-energy malnutrition per 100,000 inhabitants in 2002. Persons in prisons, concentration camps, and refugee camps are affected more often due to poor nutrition.

In 1989, he moved to the United States with his father R√∂st√§m (also spelled Rustam), a former boxer who dominated Gata, made him study chess almost exclusively, and acted as his coach and manager. Businessman James Cayne provided financial support to the Kamskys. In 1989, Gata Kamsky won a tournament in New York to earn the right to challenge Garry Kasparov to a two-game match; he lost that match later that year 0‚Äì2.

Kamsky played in both, and in both cases qualified for the respective Candidates Tournaments. The Candidates tournaments were largely dominated by Kamsky and Viswanathan Anand. In the first round of the 1994‚Äì95 FIDE Candidates matches, Kamsky beat Paul van der Sterren (+3=3‚àí1). Kamsky's quarter-final match against Anand, held in July and August 1994 in Sanghi Nagar, India, was more dramatic. After draws in the first two games, Anand won the next two games to take an imposing 3‚Äì1 lead. Game 5 was drawn. Kamsky then scored 2¬Ω‚Äì¬Ω in the remaining three games to tie the match 4‚Äì4 (+2=4‚àí2), then won the two rapid chess playoff games to win the match.

Kamsky's next rated games after his loss to Karpov were in 1999, when he returned to play in the FIDE Knockout World Championship event in Las Vegas, where he played a first- round, two-game match against the eventual tournament winner, Alexander Khalifman. Kamsky won the first game, lost the second game, and then lost the rapid play-off games. Comeback (2004 onwards) Kamsky retired from the world of chess for eight years, except for a two-game match in 1999. The first sighting of Kamsky after that came in March 2004 when ChessBase reported that Sam Sloan had spoken to him. Kamsky did not play another game in public until June 15, 2004, when he participated in the 106th New York Masters, 106th New York Masters Crosstable playing four games in a day with a time control of 30 minutes for all his moves.

He was rated number 19 in the world on the April 2005 FIDE Elo rating list, at 2700. He retained this rating on the July 2005 list, but moved up to number 18, after a good unbeaten result at the 2005 HB Global Challenge tournament, held in Minneapolis in May, 2005. He has since returned to international chess, most notably finishing second behind Veselin Topalov at the M-Tel Masters event. Soon after, Kamsky led the US team to the bronze medal at the 2006 Chess Olympiad in Turin. On July 4, 2006, he tied for first place with nine others at the Philadelphia World Open, then won the play-off, winning about $7,000. A number of successes in 2007 marked his return to the playing level he had before his retirement, hinting at the possibility of becoming again a challenger for the very top of the world's chess hierarchy. Kamsky played in the FIDE Chess World Cup 2005, and qualified for the Candidates Tournament for the World Chess Championship 2007, in May‚ÄìJune 2007. He won his first round match against √âtienne Bacrot (+3‚àí0=1), but was eliminated when he lost his second round match to Boris Gelfand +0‚àí2=3.

Seeded 11th, he won his first three rounds and then defeated Peter Svidler, former FIDE world champion Ruslan Ponomariov and future world number-one Magnus Carlsen to reach the finals. In the final he defeated Alexei Shirov (+1‚àí0=3) to win the title, shocking many in the chess world. Kamsky's victory earned him a match against world number-one Veselin Topalov in 2009 for the right to challenge for the World Chess Championship 2010 against world champion Viswanathan Anand. The match was held in Sofia, Bulgaria, in February 2009. Although Kamsky won game four to level the match 2‚Äì2, Topalov scored +2 in the final 3 games (including an exciting last round victory on the White side of the French Defense) to win the match 4¬Ω‚Äì2¬Ω. Kamsky played board one for the United States in the 2008 Chess Olympiad, held in Dresden, Germany in November. The U.S. team captured the bronze medals. Kamsky participated in the Chess World Cup 2009 but was upset in the third round by Wesley So. In January 2010 Kamsky won the 52nd Reggio Emilia chess tournament (he came equal first with Zolt√°n Alm√°si, defeating him in the last round, but had a better Buchholz tiebreak). In May 2010 he tied for 1st‚Äì3rd with Vladimir Kramnik and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov in the President's Cup in Baku. He became U.S. Champion on May 25, 2010, after winning a rapid playoff game with second-place finisher Yury Shulman. This championship, Kamsky's second, came 19 years after he won his first U.S. championship. In August 2010, Kamsky won clear first at the Open Grenke Rapid World Championship (Mainz Chess Classic), a Rapid Chess tournament, with 10/11, defeating world No. 5 and defending champion Levon Aronian, 2004 FIDE champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov, and Sergey Karjakin en route to the title ahead of Grischuk, Shirov and several other strong Grandmasters. From August 23 through August 31, Kamsky participated in the Baku Open in Azerbaijan, where he was the top seed. He won his final three games to clinch clear first with 7¬Ω/9. From April 13 through April 18, 2011, Kamsky participated in the United States Championship, where he was the top seed. He won the tournament for the second consecutive year, becoming the first player since Lev Alburt in 1985 to win consecutive U.S. Championships; the title was his third career United States Championship. As a finalist of the 2010 world championship cycle, Kamsky was given direct entry to the eight player Candidates Tournament to determine the challenger for the World Chess Championship 2012. The candidates tournament began with best-of-four game match format in May 2011 in Kazan, with Kamsky facing Veselin Topalov in the quarterfinals. With a win on the Black side of the Gruenfeld defense in the second game, Kamsky held on to defeat the top-seeded Topalov 2¬Ω‚Äì1¬Ω to advance to the semifinals. In the semifinals, he faced the 2009 Chess World Cup champion Boris Gelfand in a rematch of their 2007 Candidates tournament meeting won by Gelfand. After four games, the match was tied at 2‚Äì2, with rapid tiebreaks to decide the winner on May 16. In the rapid tiebreaks, Kamsky won game 3 with black to take a 2‚Äì1 lead and needed only a draw with white in the final rapid game to advance to the final. However, Gelfand won with black to force a blitz playoff, which he won 2‚Äì0 to eliminate Kamsky and reach the Candidates final. In May 2012, Kamsky participated in the 2012 U.S. Championship, where he was seeded second behind defending champion Hikaru Nakamura. He scored 5/7 to qualify for the round-robin stage against Nakamura, 2006 champion Alexander Onischuk, and 2008 champion Yuri Shulman. In the round-robin stage, he drew Nakamura with black and then defeated Onischuk on the White side of the Ruy Lopez. In 2013 and 2014 he won the tournament, and the last title was his fifth career United States Championship. In 2016 he placed third at the Chigorin Memorial tournament in Saint Petersburg.final results Chigorin Memorial tournament, Oct. 2016, chess-results.com Notable tournament victories * Buffalo Open, 1989 * Tilburg, 1990 * World Open, 1991 * U.S. Championship, 1991 * Buenos Aires, 1993 * Las Palmas, 1994 * Dos Hermanas, 1995 * New York, 2006 * World Open, 2006 * Mashantucket, 2007 * Chess World Cup, Khanty-Mansiysk, 2007 * National Open, Las Vegas, 2008 * Reggio Emilia, 2010 * Philadelphia Open, 2010 * U.S. Championship, 2010 * Rapid World Championship, Mainz 2010 * Baku Open, 2010 * World Open, 2011 * U.S. Championship, 2011 * U.S. Championship, 2013 * Philadelphia Open, 2014 * U.S. Championship, 2014 * The 8th New York International, 2015 * Cappelle la Grande, 2016 World championship matches and qualifiers * FIDE WCC Candidates Match 1994, Wijk aan Zee, Kamsky‚Äìvan der Sterren (4¬Ω‚Äì2¬Ω) * FIDE WCC Candidates Match 1994, Sanghi Nagar, Kamsky‚ÄìAnand (6‚Äì4) * PCA WCC Candidates Match 1994, New York, Kamsky‚ÄìKramnik (4¬Ω‚Äì1¬Ω) * PCA WCC Candidates Match 1994, Linares, Kamsky‚ÄìShort (5¬Ω‚Äì1¬Ω) * FIDE WCC Candidates Match 1995, Sanghi Nagar, Kamsky‚ÄìSalov (5¬Ω‚Äì1¬Ω) * PCA WCC Candidates Match 1995, Las Palmas, Kamsky‚ÄìAnand (4¬Ω‚Äì6¬Ω) * FIDE World Chess Championship 1996, Elista, Kamsky‚ÄìKarpov (7¬Ω‚Äì10¬Ω) * FIDE WCC Knockout 1999 Second Round, Las Vegas, Kamsky‚ÄìKhalifman (1¬Ω‚Äì2¬Ω) * WCC Candidates Match 2007 Round 1, Elista, Kamsky‚ÄìBacrot (3¬Ω‚Äì¬Ω) * WCC Candidates Match 2007 Round 2, Elista, Kamsky‚ÄìGelfand (1¬Ω‚Äì3¬Ω) * Chess World Cup 2007 Quarterfinals, Khanty‚ÄìMansiysk, Kamsky‚ÄìPonomariov (1¬Ω‚Äì0¬Ω) * Chess World Cup 2007 Semifinals, Khanty‚ÄìMansiysk, Kamsky‚ÄìCarlsen (1¬Ω‚Äì0¬Ω) * Chess World Cup 2007 Championship Match, Khanty‚ÄìMansiysk, Kamsky‚ÄìShirov (2¬Ω‚Äì1¬Ω) * WCC Candidates Match 2009, Sofia, Kamsky‚ÄìTopalov (2¬Ω‚Äì4¬Ω) * WCC Candidates Match 2011 Quarterfinals, Kazan, Kamsky‚ÄìTopalov (2¬Ω‚Äì1¬Ω) * WCC Candidates Match 2011 Semifinals, Kazan, Kamsky‚ÄìGelfand [2‚Äì2 (2‚Äì4)] Notable games Here Kamsky as Black crushes Kramnik en route to winning the 1994 Candidates match: :Kramnik vs. Kamsky, World Championship Quarter-Finals Match, New York 1994 1\\\\.

One of the city's most popular nightlife and entertainment districts, it is home to a historic gay village and vibrant counterculture community. History Capitol Hill c. 1917 In the early 1900s Capitol Hill was known as 'Broadway Hill' after the neighborhood's main thoroughfare. The origin of its current name is disputed. James A. Moore, the real estate developer who platted much of the area, reportedly gave it the name in the hope that the Washington State Capitol would move to Seattle from Olympia. Another story claims that Moore named it after the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Denver, Colorado, his wife's hometown. According to author Jacqueline Williams, both stories are likely true. The neighborhood was frequently referred to as Catholic Hill up until the 1980s due to its large Roman Catholic population. View of Fourteenth Avenue, an area known as Millionaire's Row (published 1909 in an Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition pamphlet Capitol Hill is home to some of Seattle's wealthiest neighborhoods, including \\"Millionaire's Row\\" along 14th Avenue E. south of Volunteer Park (family residences on tree-lined streets) and the Harvard-Belmont Landmark District. The neighborhood is home to many distinguished apartment houses, including several by Fred Anhalt, as well as a few surviving Classical Revival complexes such as the Blackstone Apartments. The neighborhood's architecture did not fare so well in the post-World War II period; architect Victor Steinbrueck wrote in 1962 of the \\"tremendous growth of less-than-luxury apartments\\" that at first \\"appear to be consistent with the clean, direct approach associated with contemporary architecture\\" but whose \\"open outdoor corridors\\" totally defeat their \\"large 'view' windows\\" by giving occupants no privacy if they leave their blinds open to enjoy the view. He added, \\"most tenants close their blinds and look for another apartment when their lease runs out.\\"Victor Steinbrueck, Seattle Cityscape, University of Washington Press, Seattle, 1962, p. 73. A Fred Anhalt apartment building on Harvard Avenue E. A sign over the rear door of the Harvard Exit Theatre recognizing the Woman's Century Club, founded in 1891. The club constructed the building in 1925 to serve as its clubhouse; it is now the Mexican consulate During the George Floyd protests of 2020, Cal Anderson Park and much of the upper Pike- Pine Corridor surrounding the SPD East Precinct were barricaded by protesters and declared the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ). Geography Capitol Hill is situated on a steep hill just east of the city's downtown central business district. It is bounded by Interstate 5 (I-5) to the west (beyond which are Downtown, Cascade, and Eastlake); to the north by State Route 520 and Interlaken Park (beyond which are Portage Bay and Montlake); to the south by E. Union and E. Madison Streets (beyond which are First Hill and the Central District); and to the east by 23rd and 24th Avenues E. (beyond which is Madison Valley). Capitol Hill's main thoroughfare is Broadway, the commercial heart of the district. Other major streets in the area are 10th, 12th, 15th, and 19th Avenues, all running north‚Äìsouth, and E. Pine, E. Pike, E. John, E. Thomas, and E. Aloha Streets and E. Olive Way, running east‚Äìwest. Of these streets, large portions of E. Pike Street, E. Pine Street, Broadway, 15th Avenue, and E. Olive Way are lined almost continuously with street-level retail. The Pike-Pine corridor (the area between Pike and Pine streets) from Boren Avenue through 15th Street is another main thoroughfare in Capitol Hill, full of coffeeshops, bars, restaurants, and other food and music businesses. The neighborhood as a whole is largely characterized by mid-rise buildings occupied by an eclectic mix of businesses. The highest point on Capitol Hill, at above sea level, is in Volunteer Park, adjacent to the water tower. Capitol Hill is also the location of half of Seattle's 12 steepest street grades: 21% on E. Roy Street between 25th and 26th Avenues E. (eastern slope), 19% on E. Boston Street between Harvard Avenue E. and Broadway E. (western slope) and on E. Ward Street between 25th and 26th Avenues E. (eastern slope), and 18% on E. Highland Drive between 24th and 25th Avenues E. (eastern slope), on E. Lee Street between 24th and 25th Avenues E. (eastern slope), and on E. Roy Street between Melrose and Bellevue Avenues E. (western slope). Panorama of Capitol Hill during blue hour, as seen from the 40th floor of 1525 9th Ave. Transit and development Bus transit service to and within Capitol Hill is provided by King County Metro, including routes 10, 12, 43 and 49 of the Seattle trolleybus system. The First Hill Streetcar line, which opened in January 2016, terminates in the neighborhood. The Capitol Hill station of Link Light Rail opened in March 2016 as part of the University Link extension. A large three-building development is currently under construction above the light rail station, with construction estimated to be complete in 2020. The development is expected to bring significant height and density increases to the Broadway corridor of Capitol Hill; a zoning exception was made by the City Council in exchange for an increase above the typical minimum percentage of affordable housing units, which will constitute 41% of the new buildings. Culture =Arts and entertainment= Capitol Hill has a reputation as a bastion of musical culture in Seattle and is the neighborhood most closely associated with the grunge scene from the early 1990s, although most of the best-known music venues of that era were actually located slightly outside the neighborhood. The music scene has transformed since those days and now a variety of genres (electronica, rock, punk, folk, salsa, hip hop and trance) are represented. The neighborhood figures prominently in nightlife and entertainment, with many bars hosting live music and with numerous fringe theatres. Most of the Hill's major thoroughfares are dotted with coffeehouses, taverns and bars, and residences cover the gamut from modest motel-like studio apartment buildings to some of the city's most historic mansions, with the two types sometimes shoulder-to-shoulder. Capitol Hill is also home to two of the city's best-known movie theaters, both of which are part of the Landmark Theatres chain. Both theaters are architectural conversions of private meeting halls: the Harvard Exit (now closed permanently) in the former home of the Woman's Century Club (converted in the early 1970s) and the Egyptian Theatre, in a former Masonic lodge (converted in the mid-1980s). There is also Seattle's only cinematheque, the Northwest Film Forum, which in addition to screening films, teaches classes on filmmaking and produces film alongside Seattle's burgeoning filmmaking community. The Broadway Performance Hall, located on the campus of Seattle Central College (SCC), also hosts a variety of lectures, performances, and films. These theaters respectively host showings for the Seattle International Film Festival (SIFF) and the Seattle Lesbian & Gay Film Festival every year. The cast of MTV's Real World Seattle: Bad Blood lived in and were filmed in Capitol Hill during 2016. Since 1997, Capitol Hill has hosted the Capitol Hill Block Party annually in late July, an outdoor music festival that occurs on Pike Street between Broadway and 12th Ave and Union and Pine Street. =Coffeehouses= Besides the large Seattle- based chains‚ÄîStarbucks, Seattle's Best Coffee (now owned by Starbucks), and Tully's Coffee‚ÄîCapitol Hill has been home to some of the city's most prominent locally owned coffeehouses. David Schomer's Espresso Vivace on Broadway is credited as the birthplace of artisanal coffee culture and latte art in Seattle and the United States as a whole. The neighborhood is also considered a test market for coffeehouses by Starbucks Corporation, which placed two stealth Starbucks stores on Capitol Hill in 2009 and 2011 that were later closed by 2019. =LGBTQ community= One of Capitol Hill's eleven rainbow crosswalks, pictured at Broadway and Pine Street A bourgeoning counterculture community on Capitol Hill in the mid-20th century became a magnet for LGBTQ people seeking community acceptance at a time when the city's earlier gay capital in Downtown Seattle's (notoriously rowdy) Pioneer Square was in decline. As a result, large-scale gay residential settlement of Capitol Hill began in the early 1960s. Accordingly, the district continues to be home to a sizable number of gay and lesbian couples, making Capitol Hill Seattle's \\"gayborhood\\". The roots of the LGBTQ community on Capitol Hill can be traced to a change in the demographics and culture of the city as a whole in the 1950s and 1960s. LGBTQ Seattleites had long congregated in Pioneer Square, often interchangeably termed \\"Skid Road,\\" and had built up a community in establishments such as the Double Header, the Casino, and the Garden of Allah (just north of the neighborhood). When the notoriously unsavory neighborhood, which houses many notable works of Victorian and Edwardian architecture, was targeted for urban renewal (and perhaps even prior), the Seattle Police Department engaged in extortion, allowing illegal homosexual practices and cross-dressing to continue only in bars which paid them off. The payoffs did not always guarantee security, and in 1966, citing alarm over the city's widespread image as a bastion of gay culture and tolerance, SPD planned a major house-cleaning of the gay bars in Pioneer Square. The gay community then began to migrate out of Downtown Seattle. The rise of American counterculture on the west coast took place during the same period. Although the University District, home to sites such as the Ave, the University of Washington, Parrington Lawn or \\"Hippie Hill\\", the Last Exit Off Brooklyn coffeehouse, and the Blue Moon Tavern, was the primary hub of 1960s counterculture in Seattle, Capitol Hill also experienced a very noticeable influx of artistic and bohemian life. Largely driven by low rent from \\"white flight\\" in the steadily disappearing \\"auto row\\" of Capitol Hill's Pike-Pine Corridor neighborhood, LGBTQ Seattleites began to build the foundations of a community of their own deep in the structure of this evolving neighborhood. After the Elite Tavern, the first gay bar on Broadway, opened in the 1950s, the LGBTQ community on the Hill began to grow parallel to its decline in Pioneer Square. By the late 1960s, Capitol Hill was primed to become the local home base of the gay liberation movement and community throughout the decade following the Stonewall riots of 1969 in New York City. Capitol Hill was the birthplace of many notable LGBTQ organizations during the first 25 years of the gay rights movement. In July 1969, only a few days after the Stonewall riots, the Dorian Society opened Dorian House in Capitol Hill's Hilltop neighborhood, a locale which soon became an important hub of LGBTQ youth outreach. Now called Seattle Counseling Service, it was the first mental health organization in the United States specializing in affirming treatment of ostracized LGBTQ youth. In 1974, the Gay Community Center opened in the Hilltop area. In 1991, Lambert House LGBTQ youth community center, also in the Hilltop, opened its doors and became a model organization for queer youth outreach. After moving from Downtown in 1982, Seattle's official gay pride parades took place on Capitol Hill for several decades, and the annual festival continues to hold block parties on the Hill. In the 1980s, the Northwest AIDS Foundation, the Chicken Soup Brigade, and the Evergreen Health Advocates formed to combat the growing HIV/AIDS epidemic, and eventually merged to become the Lifelong AIDS Alliance. The gay and bisexual male community on Capitol Hill was the epicenter of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the region. In addition to the organizations that would become Lifelong, more services were created to serve the growing health needs of the gay community in the 1990s, including Pike-Pine's Gay City Health Project, formed in 1995. Among the deceased in 1995 was Washington's first openly-gay legislator, Cal Anderson, who was the state congressional representative for Capitol Hill and the University District. In remembrance of Anderson's legacy, Lincoln Reservoir Park, the main Olmstedian centerpiece to the urban landscape of the Broadway, Pike-Pine, and Hilltop neighborhoods which form the core of Capitol Hill's LGBTQ community, was renamed in his honor. In 2020, the plaza atop Capitol Hill light rail station adjacent to Cal Anderson Park will become home to the AIDS Memorial Pathway (AMP), a permanent outdoor public art gallery commemorating victims of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In 2019, the block of E Denny Way at the station that connects Broadway to Cal Anderson Park was renamed E Barbara Bailey Way, after a notable small business owner and LGBTQ rights activist. During Pride week of 2015, eleven permanent rainbow crosswalks were painted in the upper Pike-Pine Corridor. In 1993, the oldest gay bar on Broadway, the Elite Tavern, was bombed by neo-Nazis. Capitol Hill has become the target of an increasing number of anti-LGBTQ hate crimes in the early 21st century. Landmarks and institutions Kerry Hall is the original building of the Cornish School and now the last piece of the Cornish College of the Arts remaining on the Hill (the rest is now in the Denny Triangle). Registered Historic Places on Capitol Hill include the Harvard- Belmont Landmark District, in which is located the original building of the Cornish College of the Arts; Volunteer Park, in which are the Seattle Asian Art Museum and Volunteer Park Conservatory; and The Northwest School. In addition to Volunteer Park, parks on the Hill include the exquisite fountain and lawn themed Cal Anderson Park, Louisa Boren Park, Interlaken Park, Roanoke Park, and Thomas Street Park. Lake View Cemetery, containing the graves of Bruce Lee and his son Brandon Lee, lies directly north of Volunteer Park, and the Grand Army of the Republic Cemetery north of it in turn. St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral dominates the North Capitol Hill skyline. Also on the Hill are The Northwest School, Seattle Academy of Arts and Sciences, Hamlin Robinson School, St. Joseph School, Holy Names Academy, Seattle Hebrew Academy, Seattle Preparatory School, Seattle University, Seattle Central Community College, and St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral. The oldest African- American church in Seattle is located on 14th Avenue, between E. Pike and E. Pine streets. The First African Methodist Episcopal Church was originally incorporated in 1891 as the Jones Street Church (when 14th Avenue was called Jones Street). The church was constructed in 1912, replacing the large house where congregations were previously held on the same site. It was designated as a Seattle landmark in 1984. The First Methodist Protestant Church of Seattle, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was remodeled and is now occupied by a design and marketing firm. There is one Jewish synagogue near Capitol Hill. Temple De Hirsch Sinai, whose Alhadeff Sanctuary was designed by B. Marcus Priteca, among others, is just south of Madison Street, placing it technically in the Central District.Temple De Hirsch Sinai References * Kathryn McGrath, \\"Clubless in Seattle\\", University of Washington Daily Online, October 3, 1996: on the Teen Dance Ordinance.

Commissioned in 1934, she was one of the most decorated ships of World War II, earning 17 battle stars and the Presidential Unit Citation. Like most of her sister ships, she saw extensive action during the Guadalcanal campaign, including the Battle of Cape Esperance and the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, during which she was heavily damaged and her captain and admiral killed. Earlier in the battle she mistakenly fired on the light cruiser , causing serious damage and inflicting numerous casualties. Decommissioned immediately after the end of the war, she was sold for scrap in 1959. Her bridge wings, damaged during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal and removed during repairs, are now mounted on a promontory in Golden Gate National Recreation Area. They are set on the great circle course from San Francisco to Guadalcanal. Construction and commissioning San Francisco was laid down on 9 September 1931 at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, under the supervision of Naval constructor Charles W. Fisher Jr.; launched on 9 March 1933; sponsored by Miss Barbara M. Bailly; and commissioned on 10 February 1934, Captain Royal E. Ingersoll in command. The New Orleans-class cruisers were the last U.S. cruisers built to the specifications and standards of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. Such ships, with a limit of 10,000 tons standard displacement and 8-inch caliber main guns, may be referred to as \\"treaty cruisers.\\" Originally classified as a light cruiser before she was laid down due to her thin armor, she was reclassified as a heavy cruiser because of her 8-inch guns. The term \\"heavy cruiser\\" was not defined until the London Naval Treaty in 1930. Inter-war period After an extensive shakedown cruise ‚Äì which included operations off Mexico, in Hawaiian waters, off Washington and British Columbia, and a voyage to the Panama Canal Zone ‚Äì the cruiser returned to the Mare Island Navy Yard. Gunnery installation and conversion to a flagship took her into 1935. In February, she joined Cruiser Division 6 (Crudiv 6) at San Diego. In May, she moved north and participated in Fleet Problem XVI, then returned to southern California. A few weeks later, she was back off the northwest coast for fleet tactics, and in July, she steamed farther north to Alaska. In August, she returned to California and, through the end of 1938, San Francisco continued to range the eastern Pacific, cruising from the state of Washington to Peru and from California to Hawaii. In January 1939, she departed the west coast to participate in Fleet Problem XX, conducted in the Atlantic east of the Lesser Antilles. In March, she became flagship of CruDiv 7 and commenced a goodwill tour of South American ports. Departing Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in early April, she called at ports on the east coast of that continent, moved through the Strait of Magellan and visited west coast ports, then in early June, transited the Panama Canal to complete her voyage around the continent. World War II On 1 September 1939, World War II started, and on 14 September, San Francisco moved south from Naval Station Norfolk to join the Neutrality Patrol. The cruiser carried freight and passengers to San Juan, Puerto Rico, thence sailed for a patrol of the West Indies as far south as Trinidad. On 14 October, she completed her patrol back at San Juan and headed for Norfolk, where she remained into January 1940. On 11 January, she headed for Guantanamo Bay, where she was relieved as flagship by , where she returned to the Pacific. Transiting the Panama Canal in late February, she called at San Pedro and, in March, continued on to her new home port, Pearl Harbor, where she rejoined CruDiv 6. In May 1940, she steamed northwest to the Puget Sound Navy Yard for an overhaul, during which she also received four guns. On 29 September, she returned to Pearl Harbor. In early May 1941, she became flagship of CruDiv 6; and, at the end of July, she moved east for a cruise to Long Beach, California, returning to Hawaii on 27 August. In September, the flag of CruDiv 6 was hauled down; and on 11 October, San Francisco entered the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard for an overhaul which was scheduled for completion on 25 December. =Pearl Harbor attack= On 7 December 1941, San Francisco was in Pearl Harbor awaiting docking and the cleaning of her heavily fouled bottom. Her engineering plant was largely broken down for overhaul. Ammunition for her 5 in (127mm) and 8 in (203mm) guns had been placed in storage. Her guns had been removed to permit installation of four quadruple mounts, although the mounts had not yet been installed. Her machine guns were being overhauled. Only small arms and two machine guns were available. Moreover, a number of San Francisco's officers and men were absent. At 0755, Japanese planes began bombing dives on Battleship Row anchored near Ford Island. Off-duty signalman Ed Ifkin was relaxing on the signal bridge. \\"I was reading the newspaper I'd just bought at the kiosk on the wharf, when an airplane buzzed over my head with that big red meatball on its side. I was trained to recognize foreign insignia and knew right away it was Japanese. I telephoned down to the bridge and told the duty officer. He said, 'Ifkin you'll go on report for horsing around,' when BOOM! The first torpedo hit (USS) Oklahoma. Our guns were down, so a bunch of us climbed over to \\"New Orleans.\\" It was berthed right next us. We spent the next two hours feeding ammunition to the gunners. Ifkin is now recognized as the first U.S.sailor to report the Japanese attack that completely shocked the American Navy and burst the nation into the World War.{cite: Kruth interview} By 0800, the attack on Pearl Harbor was well underway. The men of San Francisco secured the ship for watertightness and began looking for opportunities to fight back. Some crossed to to help man anti-aircraft batteries on that ship. Others began using available rifles and machine guns. Ammunition for machine guns was transferred to for use. ‚ÄúWhen the Japanese left the entire harbor was a shambles,‚Äù Iftkin recalled. ‚ÄúThe fires; the oil in the water from the torpedoed ships . . . the ‚ÄúArizona‚Äù burned for two days.‚Äù{cite: Kruth interview} San Francisco was not bombed or damaged during the Japanese air raid. After the attack was over, work resumed to make San Francisco seaworthy and combat-ready. On 14 December, the cruiser left the yard; the scaling of her keel had been postponed in favor of more necessary repairs on other ships. On 16 December, she sortied with Task Force 14 (TF 14) to relieve Wake Island. The force moved west with a Marine fighter squadron onboard and a Marine battalion embarked in . However, when Wake Island fell to the Japanese on 23 December, TF 14 was diverted to Midway Atoll which it reinforced. On 29 December, the force returned to Pearl Harbor. =1942= On 8 January 1942, San Francisco again moved west. In TF 8, she steamed toward Samoa to rendezvous with, and cover the off-loading of, transports carrying reinforcements to Tutuila, Samoa. There, she joined Task Force 17 for raids on Japanese installations in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands. San Francisco arrived in the Samoan area on 18 January, and on the 24th was detached to continue coverage for the transports while the remainder of the task force and TF 17 conducted offensive operations to the northwest. On 8 February, San Francisco departed from Tutuila. On the 10th, she rejoined CruDiv 6, then in TF 11, and she set a course for an area northeast of the Solomon Islands to strike Rabaul. However, the American force was sighted and attacked by two waves of Mitsubishi G4M \\"Betty\\" medium bombers. Sixteen of the planes were destroyed, but since the element of surprise had been lost, TF 11 retired eastward. During the next few days, TF 11 ‚Äì centered around ‚Äì conducted operations in the South Pacific Area, then headed for New Guinea to participate with TF 17 in a raid against Japanese shipping and installations. On 7 March, one of San Franciscos scout planes was reported missing and could not be found. On the night of 9‚Äì10 March, TFs 11 and 17 entered the Gulf of Papua, whence, at dawn, Lexington and launched their aircraft to cross the Owen Stanley Range and attack the Japanese at Salamaua and Lae. The next day, the missing plane was sighted by and recovered by San Francisco. It had landed on the water, but had been unable to communicate. The pilot, Lieutenant J. A. Thomas, and the radioman, O. J. Gannan, had headed for Australia, sailing the plane backwards as it tended to head into the prevailing east wind. In five days and 21 hours, they had covered approximately 385 miles (715 km) on a course within 5 degrees of that intended. San Francisco returned to Pearl Harbor on 26 March. On 22 April, the cruiser departed Oahu for San Francisco in the escort of convoy 4093. At the end of May, she headed west, escorting convoy PW 2076, made up of transports carrying the 37th Army Division, destined for Suva, and special troops bound for Australia. The cruiser remained in the escort force as far as Auckland, New Zealand. There she steamed for Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 29 June. San Francisco steamed west with and to escort convoy 4120 to the Fiji Islands. From there, she got underway to rendezvous with the Solomon Islands Expeditionary Force. Operation Watchtower ‚Äì the Guadalcanal-Tulagi offensive ‚Äì opened on the morning of 7 August. Through that day and the remainder of the month, San Francisco helped to cover the American forces in the area. The flag of Rear Admiral Norman Scott, commanding the cruisers attached to TF 18, was shifted to San Francisco. On 3 September, San Franciscos force put into Noum√©a, New Caledonia, for fuel and provisions. On 8 September, the ships departed that island to cover reinforcements moving up to Guadalcanal. On the 11th, San Franciscos force, TF 18, rendezvoused with TF 17, the group, and the next day, both groups refueled at sea. On 14 September, the reinforcement convoy departed the New Hebrides. TF 61 commenced covering operations with TF 17, operating east of TF 18 and conforming to their movements. At about 1450 on 15 September, was torpedoed on the starboard side. Fires broke out on the carrier. Explosions multiplied the fires. Admiral Scott took command of TF 18. San Francisco and prepared to take the carrier in tow, but by 1520, the fires were out of control and destroyers began taking on survivors. torpedoed the burning hulk. TF 18 then headed for Espiritu Santo. On the morning of 17 September, San Francisco, , and five destroyers put back to sea to rendezvous with TF 17 and resume coverage of reinforcement convoys. Other units of TF 18 had headed for Noum√©a with Wasp survivors. On 23 September, San Francisco, Salt Lake City, Minneapolis, , , and , and Destroyer Squadron 12 (DesRon 12) became TF 64, a surface screening and attack force under the command of Admiral Scott in San Francisco. The next day, the force headed to the New Hebrides. Battle of Cape Esperance On 7 October 1942, TF 64 (minus Chester and Minneapolis) departed from Espiritu Santo, the New Hebrides, and moved back into the Solomons to cover Allied reinforcements and to intercept similar operations by the Japanese. On 11 October, at about 1615, the ships commenced a run northward from Rennel Island, to intercept an enemy force of two cruisers and six destroyers reported heading for Guadalcanal from the Buin-Faisi, Bougainville Island area. The force continued north to approach Savo Island in The Slot from the southwest. By 2330, when the warships were approximately northwest of Savo Island, they turned to make a further search of the area. A few minutes after setting the new course, radar indicated unidentified ships to the west, several thousand yards distant. At about 2345, the Battle of Cape Esperance began. Initial confusion caused both sides to momentarily check their fire in fear of hitting their own ships. Then, the battle was reopened and continued until 0020 on 12 October, when surviving Japanese ships retired toward the Shortland Islands. Salt Lake City, Boise, and , had been damaged. Later, Duncan went down. and a destroyer had been sunk during the surface action. Two more enemy destroyers were sunk on 12 October by Marine planes from Henderson Field. After the engagement, TF 64 retired to Espiritu Santo. On 15 October, San Francisco resumed operations in support of the Guadalcanal campaign. On the evening of 20 October, her group was ordered back to Espiritu Santo. At 2119, submarine's torpedoes were reported. Chester was hit amidships on the starboard side but continued under her own power. Three other torpedoes exploded: one off Helenas starboard quarter; a second between Helena and San Francisco; and the third about off San Franciscos port beam. Two others were sighted running on the surface. San Francisco reached Espiritu Santo on the night of 21 October, but departed again on 22 October to intercept any enemy surface units approaching Guadalcanal from the north and to cover friendly reinforcements. On 28 October, Admiral Scott transferred to Atlanta. The next day, San Francisco returned to Espiritu Santo, and on 30 October, Rear Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan, the commanding officer of San Francisco when the United States entered the war, returned to the ship and raised his flag as Commander, Task Group 64.4 (TG 64.4) and prospective TF 65. Naval Battle of Guadalcanal On 31 October 1942, the newly designated TF 65 departed from Espiritu Santo, the ships again headed into the Solomon Islands to cover troop landings on Guadalcanal. Bombardment missions in the Kokumbona and Koli Point areas followed. On 6 November, the transport group completed unloading, and the force retired, arriving at Espiritu Santo on 8 November. On 10 November, San Francisco, now flagship for TG 67.4, got underway again toward Guadalcanal. Just before noon, a Japanese twin-float reconnaissance plane began shadowing the formation. The force arrived off Lunga Point on 12 November, and the transports commenced unloading. By mid- afternoon, an approaching Japanese air group was reported. At 1318, the ships got underway. At 1408, 21 enemy planes attacked. San Francisco (center) after being hit by a Japanese plane in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, 12 November 1942. Ship at left is . At 1416, an already-damaged torpedo bomber dropped its torpedo off San Franciscos starboard quarter. The torpedo passed alongside, but the plane crashed into San Franciscos control aft, swung around that structure, and plunged over the port side into the sea. 15 men were killed, 29 wounded, and one missing. Control aft was demolished. The ship's secondary command post, Battle Two, was burned out but was reestablished by dark. The after anti-aircraft director and radar were put out of commission. Three 20 mm mounts were destroyed. The wounded were transferred to , just before the approach of an enemy surface force was reported. The covering force escorted the transports out of the area, then reassembled and returned. At about midnight, San Francisco, in company with heavy cruiser USS Portland, the light cruisers Atlanta, Helena, and Juneau, and eight destroyers, entered Lengo Channel. At 0125 on 13 November, a Japanese naval force was discovered about to the northwest. Rear Admiral Callaghan's task group maneuvered to intercept in what became the first engagement in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. At 0148, in almost pitch darkness, San Francisco opened fire on an enemy cruiser off her starboard beam. At 0151, she trained her guns on a small cruiser or large destroyer off her starboard bow. Then in an attempt to locate other targets, San Francisco accidentally targeted . San Franciscos gunfire caused extensive damage to Atlanta, killing Admiral Scott and most of Atlantas bridge crew. Belatedly, San Francisco realized she was firing on a \\"friendly\\" ship and ceased fire. The green dye that San Francisco used to distinguish her shells from those of other ships, was later found stained on Atlantas superstructure before she sank. Shortly thereafter, was sighted and taken under fire, at an initial range of only . At about 0200, San Francisco trained her guns on . At the same time, she became the target of off her starboard bow and of a destroyer which had crossed her bow and was passing down her port side. The enemy battleship joined the cruiser and the destroyer in firing on San Francisco whose port battery engaged the destroyer but was put out of action except for one mount. The battleship put the starboard battery out of commission. San Francisco swung left while her main battery continued to fire on the battleships which, with the cruiser and the destroyer, continued to pound San Francisco. A direct hit on the navigation bridge killed or badly wounded all officers, except for the communications officer, Lieutenant Commander Bruce McCandless. Command fell to the damage control officer, Lieutenant Commander Herbert E. Schonland, but he thought his own efforts were needed to keep the ship \\"afloat and right-side up\\", so he ordered McCandless to stay at the conn. Steering and engine control were lost and shifted to Battle Two. Battle Two was out of commission by a direct hit from the port side. Control was again lost. Control was reestablished in the conning tower, which soon received a hit from the starboard side. Steering and engine control were temporarily lost, then regained. All communications were now dead. Soon thereafter, the enemy ceased firing. San Francisco followed suit and withdrew eastward along the north coast of Guadalcanal. Seventy-seven sailors, including Rear Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan and Captain Cassin Young, had been killed. Captain Young, like the San Francisco, was a veteran of the Pearl Harbor attack. 105 had been wounded. Of seven missing, three were subsequently rescued. The ship had taken 45 hits. Structural damage was extensive, but not fatal. No hits had been received below the waterline. Twenty-two fires had been started and extinguished. At about 0400, San Francisco, all her compasses out of commission, joined Helena and Juneau and followed them through Sealark Channel to sail to Espiritu Santo for initial repairs. At about 1000, Juneaus medical personnel transferred to San Francisco to assist in treating the numerous wounded. An hour later, Juneau took a torpedo on her port side from , striking in the vicinity of the bridge. \\"The entire ship seemed to explode in one mighty column of brown and white smoke and flame which rose easily a thousand feet in the air. The Juneau literally disintegrated.\\" San Francisco was hit by several large fragments from Juneau. One man was hit, both his legs were broken. Nothing was seen in the water after the smoke lifted. The surviving ships were ordered to keep going without stopping to look for survivors. Unfortunately, the 100+ survivors (out of a total complement of 697) of Juneau were forced to wait eight days for rescue while floating in the ocean, undergoing intense shark attacks. Only ten survived. On the afternoon of 14 November, San Francisco returned towards Espiritu Santo. For her participation in the action of the morning of the 13th, and for that of the night of 11‚Äì12 October, she received the Presidential Unit Citation. On 18 November, the cruiser sailed for Noum√©a, and, on 23 November, she got underway toward the United States. She reached San Francisco on 11 December. Three days later, repairs were begun at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. =1943‚Äì1944= During the yard period to repair battle damage, San Francisco received a general modernization similar to other US cruisers. Her forward superstructure was remodeled, with the bridge wings cut back, and most of the bridge windows either plated over or replaced by portholes. A large open bridge was built out at the 02 level, and modern SG surface search radar and air search radars added. In addition many 20mm and 40mm anti-aircraft cannons were installed. On 26 February 1943, she got underway to return to the South Pacific. After escorting convoy PW 2211 en route, San Francisco arrived at Noum√©a on 20 March. Five days later, she continued on to Efate. She arrived back in the Hawaiian Islands in mid-April. She then headed north to the Aleutian Islands to join the North Pacific Force, TF 16, and reached Alaska toward the end of the month. Based at Kuluk Bay, Adak Island, she operated in the Aleutians for the next months. She patrolled the western approaches to the area; participated in the assault and occupation of Attu in May and of Kiska in July; and performed escort duties. San Francisco off Adak Island in April 1943 In mid-September, she was ordered back to Pearl Harbor for repairs and reassignment to TF 14. On 29 September, San Francisco departed Pearl Harbor in Task Unit 14.2.1 (TU 14.2.1) for a raid against Wake Island. On 5 October, the group arrived off the target area and conducted two runs by the enemy positions. On 11 October, her task unit returned to Pearl Harbor. On 20 November, the force arrived off Makin. San Francisco participated in the pre- invasion bombardment of Betio, then patrolled outside the transport area to the west of Makin. On the 26th, she was detached and assigned to TG 50.1, joining , , , five cruisers, and six destroyers. With that force, she steamed toward the Marshall Islands to strike Japanese shipping and installations in the Kwajalein area. On 4 December, the carriers launched their planes against the targets. Shortly after noon, enemy aerial activity increased, and at 1250, San Francisco came under attack. Three torpedo bombers closed her on the port bow. Her guns \\"splashed\\" two. The third was shot down by Yorktown. But during the attack, the cruiser had been strafed several times. One man had been killed, and 22 were wounded. After dark, the Japanese returned, and on that night, Lexington was torpedoed. The force moved north and west. Shortly after 0130 on 5 December, enemy planes faded from the radar screens. The next day, the ships headed back to Pearl Harbor. On 22 January 1944, San Francisco sortied with TF 52 and again headed for the Marshalls. On 29 January, the division, screened by destroyers, left the formation and moved against Japanese installations on Maloelap to neutralize them during the conquest of Kwajalein. Following the bombardment, the ships proceeded on to Kwajalein. San Francisco arrived off the atoll at about 0630 on 31 January. At 0730, she opened fire on targets of opportunity, initially a small ship inside Kwajalein lagoon. At 0849, she ceased firing. At 0900, she resumed firing at targets on Berlin and Beverly islands. Through the day, she continued to shell those islands, and, in late afternoon, added Bennett Island to her targets. During the next week, she provided pre-landing barrages and support fire for operations against Burton, Berlin, and Beverly islands. On 8 February, the cruiser sailed for Majuro, whence she would operate as a unit of TF 58, the fast carrier task force. On 12 February, San Francisco, in TG 58.2, cleared Majuro lagoon. Four days later, the carriers launched their planes as part of Operation Hailstone. On the night of 16‚Äì17 February, was torpedoed. San Francisco, with others, was assigned to escort her eastward. On 19 February, the group split; Intrepid, with two destroyers, continued toward Pearl Harbor, while San Francisco and the remaining ships headed for Majuro. On 25 February, San Francisco sailed for Hawaii with TG 58.2. On 20 March, the group returned to Majuro, refueled, and departed again on 22 March to move against the Western Carolines. From 30 March to 1 April, carrier planes hit the Palaus and Woleai. San Franciscos planes flew rescue missions. On 6 April, the force was back in Majuro lagoon. A week later, the ships set a course for New Guinea. From 21‚Äì28 April, TG 58.2 supported the assault landings in the Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura) area. On 29 April, the ships moved back into the Carolines for another raid against Truk. On 30 April, San Francisco was detached and, with eight other cruisers, moved against Satawan. On completion of that bombardment mission, the cruisers rejoined TG 58.2 and headed back to the Marshalls. Initially at Majuro, San Francisco shifted to Kwajalein in early June, and on 10 June, departed that atoll in TG 53.15, the bombardment group of the Saipan invasion force. On 14 June, she commenced two days of shelling Tinian, and after the landings on Saipan shifted to fire support duties. On 16 June, she temporarily joined CruDiv 9 to bombard Guam. Word of a Japanese force en route to Saipan, however, interrupted the cannonade, and the ships returned to Saipan. On 17 June, San Francisco refueled and took up station between the approaching enemy force and the amphibious force at Saipan. On the morning of 19 June, the Battle of the Philippine Sea opened for San Francisco. At about 1046, she was straddled fore and aft by bombs. \\"... a mass of enemy planes on the screen at .\\" At 1126, the cruiser opened fire. A 40 mm shell from Indianapolis set off San Franciscos smoke screen generators. By noon, quiet had returned. At 1424, dive bombers made the last Japanese attack. By 20 June, San Francisco steamed westward in pursuit of the Japanese force. The next day, she returned to the Saipan area and resumed operations with the covering force for the transports. On 8 July, San Francisco again steamed to Guam to bombard enemy positions. During the next four days, she shelled targets in the Agat and Agana areas. On 12 July, she returned to Saipan to replenish and refuel, and on 18 July, again took station off Guam. From 18‚Äì20 July, she shelled enemy positions, supported beach demolition units, and provided night harassing and defense repair interdiction in the Agat and Faci Point areas. On 21 July, she began to support Marines assaulting the Agat beaches. On 24 July, the cruiser shifted her fire to Orote Point. On 30 July, she headed, via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor, for San Francisco. The cruiser arrived back on the west coast on 16 August for overhaul. On 31 October, she steamed west again, and on 21 November arrived at Ulithi, where she resumed flagship duties for CruDiv 6. On 10 December, she cleared the anchorage and moved toward the Philippines in TG 38.1. On 14‚Äì15 December, during carrier strikes against Luzon, San Franciscos planes were employed on antisubmarine patrol and in rescue work. On 16 December, the force headed for a rendezvous with TG 30.17, the replenishment force. A typhoon interrupted the refueling operations; and the ships rode out the storm for the next two days. On 19 December, she participated in a search for survivors from three destroyers which had gone down during the typhoon. On 20 December, TF 38 turned westward again to resume operations against Luzon; but high seas precluded strikes. On 24 December, the force returned to Ulithi. =1945= Six days later, the force again sortied from Ulithi. On 2‚Äì3 January 1945, strikes were conducted against Formosa. From 5‚Äì7 January, Luzon was hit. On 9 January, fighter sweeps against Formosa were resumed. The force then headed for the Bashi Channel and a five-day, high-speed strike against enemy surface units in the South China Sea and against installations along the coast of Indochina. On 15‚Äì16 January, the Hong Kong-Amoy-Swatow area was hit, and on 20 January, the force passed through Luzon Strait to resume operations against Formosa. On 21 January, aerial opposition was constant. Bogies appeared on the screen throughout the day. and were hit. On 22 January, strikes were launched against the Ryukyu Islands, and the next day, the force headed for the Western Carolines. Arriving on 26 January, the ships sailed again on 10 February. On 16‚Äì17 February, strikes were conducted against air facilities in central Honsh≈´. On 18 February, the force moved toward the Volcano and Bonin Islands, and on 19 February, covering operations for the Iwo Jima assault began. The next day, San Francisco closed on Iwo Jima with other cruisers and assumed fire support duties, which she continued until 23 February. Then she headed back toward Japan. On 25 February, Tokyo was the target. Poor weather prohibited operations against Nagoya on the following day, and on 27 February, the force headed back to Ulithi. On 21 March, San Francisco, now attached to Task Force 54 (TF 54) for the invasion of Okinawa, departed Ulithi for the Ryukyus. On 25 March, she approached Kerama Retto, west of Okinawa, and furnished fire support for minesweeping and underwater demolition operations. That night, she retired and the next morning moved back in to support the landings and supply counter battery fire on Aka, Keruma, Zamami, and Yakabi Islands. By the morning of 27 March, aerial resistance had begun. The next day, San Francisco shifted to Okinawa for shore bombardment in preparation for the assault landings scheduled for 1 April. On that day, she took up station in fire support sector 5, west of Naha, and, for the next five days, shelled enemy emplacements, caves, pillboxes, road junctions, and tanks, truck, and troop concentrations. At night, she provided harassing fire near the beachhead. On 6 April, the cruiser retired to Kerama Retto, refueled and took on ammunition, assisted in splashing a Nakajima B6N \\"Jill\\" torpedo bomber, then rejoined TF 54 off Okinawa as that force underwent another air raid. San Francisco downed a Nakajima B5N \\"Kate\\" torpedo bomber. Dawn of 7 April brought another air raid, during which a kamikaze attempted to crash the cruiser. It was splashed off the starboard bow. After the raid, San Francisco shifted to TF 51 for fire support missions on the east coast of Okinawa, rejoining TF 54 on the west coast in late afternoon. On 11 April, air attacks increased, and the next day, San Francisco set an Aichi D3A \\"Val\\" dive bomber on fire. The plane then glanced off a merchant ship and hit the water, enveloped in flames. On 13‚Äì14 April, the cruiser again operated with TF 51 off the east coast of the embattled island. The next day, she returned to Kerama Retto, there proceeding to Okinawa and operations with TF 54 in the transport area. There she provided night illumination to detect swimmers and Shinyo suicide boats, and just before midnight assisted in sinking one of the latter. During the night, two further attempts by Shinyos to close the transports were thwarted. San Francisco near Korea in 1945. With dawn, San Francisco returned to the Naha area to shell the airfield there. On 17 April, she moved up the coast and fired on the Machinate air field. The next day, she again shifted to the eastern side of the island and, that night, anchored in Nakagusuku Wan. The next day, San Francisco supported troops in the southern part of the island. From 21‚Äì24 April, she shelled targets in the Naha airstrip area; and got underway for Ulithi. On 13 May, San Francisco returned to Okinawa, arriving in Nakagusuku Wan and resuming support activities against targets in southern Okinawa. For the next few days, San Francisco supported the 96th Infantry Division in an area to the southeast of Yonabaru. On 20 May, she shifted to Kutaka Shima, and by the night of 22 May, she had depleted her supply of ammunition for her main batteries. On 25 May, the Japanese launched a large air attack against Allied shipping in Nakagusuku Wan. On 27 May, San Francisco provided fire support for the 77th Infantry Division, and retired to Kerama Retto the next day. On 30 May, the cruiser returned to the western side of Okinawa and, for the next two weeks, supported operations of the 1st and 6th Marine Divisions. On 21 June, San Francisco was ordered to join TG 32.15, southeast of Okinawa. A week later, she put into Kerama Retto for a brief stay, then rejoined that group. In early July, she provided cover for the eastern anchorage. On 3 July, she sailed toward the Philippines to prepare for an invasion of the Japanese home islands. The cessation of hostilities in mid- August, however, obviated that operation, and San Francisco prepared for occupation duty. Between 7 December 1941 and 7 October 1945, San Francisco travelled 480,000 km and burned 114,478,423 litres of fuel oil. On her voyages, she crossed the equator 24 times and the international date line 33 times. Her guns fired 11,022 203mm shells, 24,191 127mm shells, 70,243 40mm shells and 73,904 20mm shells and her crew suffered 267 combat casualties. Her planes flew for 3,714 hours. The crew consumed 3,983,712 kg of edible provisions, ate 332,937 kg of beef, ate 925,328 kg of potatoes & ate 5,760,000 slices of bread. Navy statistics from the USS San Francisco (CA-38) World War II cruise book available at Navysite.de Post-war On 28 August 1945, the cruiser departed Subic Bay for the China coast. After a show of force in the Yellow Sea and Gulf of Pohai areas, she covered minesweeping operations, and on 8 October anchored at Inchon, Korea. From 13‚Äì16 October, she participated in another show of force operation in the Gulf of Pohai area, then returned to Inchon, where Rear Admiral Jerauld Wright, Commander, CruDiv 6, acted as senior member of the committee for the surrender of Japanese naval forces in Korea. On 27 November, San Francisco headed home. Arriving at San Francisco in mid-December, she continued on to the east coast on 5 January 1946, and arrived at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for inactivation on 19 January. Decommissioned on 10 February, she was berthed with the Philadelphia Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet until 1 March 1959, when her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. On 9 September, she was sold to the Union Mineral and Alloys Corp., New York, and scrapped at Panama City, Florida, in 1961. War memorials Removed bridge wings at Lands End During the December 1942 repair at Mare Island, it was necessary to extensively rebuild the bridge. The bridge wings were removed as part of that repair, and are now part of a memorial to the ship on a promontory in Lands End, San Francisco at Golden Gate National Recreation Area overlooking the Pacific Ocean. One wing has extensive battle damage from the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. They are set on the great circle course from San Francisco to Guadalcanal. The old ship's bell is housed at the Marines Memorial Club in San Francisco. Awards Schonland left, Nimitz center, McCandless right, on board San Francisco, December 1942. San Francisco earned 17 battle stars during World War II making her the third most decorated US ship of World War II.
