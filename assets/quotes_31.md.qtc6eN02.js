McCarthy describes this, her second novel, as a \\"conte philosophique\\".Spencer, Nicholas. \\"Social Utopia: Hannah Arendt and Mary McCarthy’s The Oasis.\\" Pg. 45 It tells the story of a group of embattled intellectuals, their quest to establish a Utopian community in the mountains of New England, and their failure to surmount ideological and personal differences for the greater good of the commune. Doubling as a roman à clef, The Oasis borrows heavily from McCarthy's experiences and frustrations with the short lived European-American Group, and serves more broadly as a critique of the “abstract idealism of intellectuals”Fuchs-Abrams, Sabrina. \\"The Liberal Cauldron: Satire of the Postwar Intellectual.\\" Mary McCarthy: Gender, Politics, and the Postwar Intellectual. Pg. 57. and their inability to enact actual change.  Plot  Set in the near future following 1949, The Oasis depicts a group of 50 radical and liberal intellectuals who venture into the mountains of New England to create a shared living commune (aptly named, “Utopia”). Already present in Utopia's formation, however, is a deep ideological schism between two rival factions: the cynical Realists and the self-righteous Purists. The Realists, led by the embittered former Marxist William Taub, anticipate the experiment will end in little more than a summer vacation and await Utopia's eventual demise, while the Purists, led by the magazine editor Macdougal Macdermott, are hesitant to perform any action that could contradict their radical, libertarian beliefs. The first challenge presented to both factions is whether or not they will admit into Utopia the Lockman family, led by the exuberant blue-blood Joe Lockman. Macdermott, who regards Lockman as a “philistine,”McCarthy, Mary. The Oasis. Pg. 10. eventually grants the Lockmans his approval for fear that he might otherwise appear elitist. The acceptance of the Lockmans, however, calls forth the larger question, “Was it to follow that anyone could be admitted to Utopia?”McCarthy. Pg. 13. By the end of the first night in Utopia, it is the Realist leader Taub, not Macdermott, who finds Lockman to be a nuisance; Taub is put on edge by Lockman's bombastic spirit and hunting rifle. The next morning, Katy Norell, one of Utopia's more vocal Purists, burns herself and ruins the commune's breakfast while cooking. Most likely an honest mishap, the incident is quickly politicized and blamed on Lockman by the Realists. Following the mishap, Katy's husband, Preston, publicly scolds Katy for ruining breakfast, demonstrating the immense strain that communal living has taken on the Utopia's residents. That night, the Realists convene a communal meeting, conspiring to exile Joe and assert their dominance over the Purists. When they are given the floor, however, Taub and his followers are unable to articulate what it is they want or on what grounds they wish to expel Joe. The meeting ends with the Purists laughing at Taub. Macdermott dismisses the Realists as “revolutionary nihilists,” explaining, “They don’t know what they want… They’re so conservative they’re afraid of their own thoughts.”McCarthy. Pg. 105-106. After a short “lyrical period” of peace, prosperity, and basking in the pastoral quaintness of the commune, the Utopians begin to question the purpose of their project, and whether or not their mission serves a greater good. Katy Norell laments not living up to the expectations of Monteverdi, the ideological “Founder” of the commune and champion of the Purists’ beliefs. They consider creating a “United States of Europe in Exile,” a mission to bring refugees displaced by World War II to America in order to create more small-scale communities like their own. However, the plan falls apart almost as quickly as it is proposed. Grand ambitions to contact congressmen, trade unionists, and newspapers dissolve into an effort to make a simple pamphlet, but this idea is also abandoned. One day, the Taubs, Katy, and other members of the commune go strawberry picking on the outskirts of Utopia, only to find that a group of locals has beaten them to the site. When the Utopians ask the locals to leave some berries for them, the Utopians are rudely dismissed. Seeing their dismay, Joe Lockman fires blanks from his gun in order to ward the intruding locals away from Utopia. Lockman then insists everyone in Utopia padlock their front doors, prompting a commune-wide philosophical debate on the implications of privatizing property in Utopia. The discussion prompted by the intruders’ arrival grows increasingly broad, with Katy and Taub disagreeing about whether or not Utopia can survive such a shake up. Katy, drunk, ends up lying in the grass in order to take in the pastoral setting, while Jim Haines, a “Lincoln-esque” magazine editor who is revered by all Utopians, begins to pack up his car to leave the commune, confirming Katy's worst suspicions that, “Ultimately, Utopia would fail.”McCarthy. Pg. 179.  Characters  William Taub- Based on Philip Rahv, McCarthy's ex-lover and editor at The Partisan Review, Taub is the leader of the Realist faction of Utopia. As the victim of the book's most “outrageous satire,”Fuchs-Abrams, Pg. 59. Taub is depicted as cowardly, lazy, self-centered, and villainous, amounting to a “not especially flattering depiction”Sumner, George. “Nicola Chiaromonte, the Politics Circle, and the Search for a Postwar ‘Third Camp.’” of the jaded anti-Stalinist. Convinced that the “potency of history” will prove the “failure of socialism,”McCarthy, Mary. The Oasis. Pg. 19. Taub is fixated on seeing Utopia fail. Macdougal Macdermott- Serving as a stand-in for Dwight Macdonald (a friend of McCarthy's and the founder of the magazine politics), Macdermott is the leader of the Purist faction. Though Macdonald is not lampooned to the same degree that Rahv is, the character of Macdermott is hot-tempered, blindly committed to being consistent in his libertarian views, and susceptible to being roped into Taub's political chess match. Joe Lockman- A “capitalist monad” who “sets the purists’ symbolic tests,” Joe’s impulsive nature pushes the ideological imperatives of both the Realists and the Purists to their limits.Wilford, Hugh. “An Oasis: The New York Intellectuals in the Late 1940s.” Pg. 218. He represents the layman, the non-intellectual, and the growing professional class that is discovering the merits of modernist thought and expression. Katy Norell- A libertarian idealist dedicated to the purist faction and stuck in a fractious marriage, Katy resembles McCarthy in 1949 more closely than any other character in The Oasis. Katy provides the book’s strongest feminine perspective and feminist argument, “reveal[ing] much remains to be learned about women’s rights in [Utopia].”Fuchs-Abrams, Pg. 60. Large sections of The Oasis hold little narrative distance from Katy, as the reader sees the mission of the commune fall apart through Katy's eyes towards the end of the novel. Jim Haines- A handsome magazine editor whose departure from Utopia portends the beginning of the end of Utopia. Susan Hapgood- A novelist and follower of the Realist faction who dotes on Taub, Susan is perhaps meant to represent the younger McCarthy, or perhaps Elizabeth Hardwick, McCarthy's friend and fellow novelist. Harold Sidney- Based on William Phillips, a co-editor of The Partisan Review with Philip Rahv, Sidney is Taub's second-in-command. Though less capricious than Taub, he is equally conniving, and, when the time comes for him to speak out against Lockman, Macdermott, and the Purists, he is also equally inept. Leo Raphael- Inspired by discussion of the commune's greater purpose, Leo proposes that the Utopians refocus their energies on a United States of Europe in Exile, in which the commune can act as a model for European refugees who wish to escape the threat of communism and settle in America. Monteverdi, “the Founder”- Based on Nicola Chiaromonte. While he does not make any actual appearance in Utopia, the Founder is seen as a sort of prophet by the Purists, his absence leaving them directionless.  Publishing history  The Oasis was originally published as an ongoing series under the name A Source of Embarrassment by the British literary magazine Horizon.Grumbach, Doris. The Company She Kept: Mary McCarthy, Herself and Her Writings. Pg. 129. It was published by Random House in 1949. Though its initial circulation was limited, the novel was reissued by Melville House in 2013 as part of its “Neversink Library” series.  Historical background  Following the bombing of Hiroshima in the summer of 1945, which McCarthy referred to as a “watershed, a dividing line,”Sumner. Pg. 56. many of the New York Intellectuals—a group, which included McCarthy, of contributors to politics, Partisan Review, and other preeminent New York writers and thinkers—became alarmed by the rapidly escalating nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union. As many of the New York Intellectuals were formerly avowed Trotskyist Communists,Wilford. Pg. 209. the group became attracted to the idea of retreating from society at large and participating in small-scale communal living. Concerning the period immediately following the war, McCarthy would later remark: “It seemed possible still, utopian but possible, to change the world on a small scale.”Sumner. Pg. 56. That summer, McCarthy and her fellow New York Intellectuals, under the guidance of activist Nicola Chiaromonte, established the European-American Group (EAG) in an effort to create “human-scaled, grassroots, transnational communities of dialogue and solidarity.” This effort towards small-scale living, however, was short lived. Soon after its founding, the EAG disbanded “due to a lack of internal consensus about its goals,” as “the Macdonald-McCarthy-Chiaromonte faction” failed to find common ground with the so-called “Partisan Review Boys,” Philip Rahv and William Phillips.Sumner. Pg. 57-58. As Hugh Wilford contends in his historio-literary analysis of The Oasis, “An Oasis: The New York Intellectuals in the Late 1940s,” the dissolution of the EAG marked the beginning of the cooptation of Old Left holdouts such as McCarthy and her contemporaries into a larger liberal, post- World War II consensus. In fact, many members of the EAG would become key figures in the creation of the Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF), a front organization designed by the Central Intelligence Agency for the purposes of winning the Cultural Cold War.Wilford. Pg. 221-222. Only a few years later, in the spring of 1949, McCarthy—along with Dwight Mcdonald, Elizabeth Hardwick, Sidney Hook, and other former EAG members—would help disrupt a communist conference held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.Grumbach. Pg. 147-148. Foreseeing this eventual shift, McCarthy spent her final days in the EAG documenting the group's failures through her writing of The Oasis.Sumner. Pg. 59.  Analysis  The Oasis has been described as “an imaginative inquiry into the causes of radical failure,”Wilford. Pg. 211. a satirical critique of the limitations of intellectual debate and the ability for intellectuals to enact actual change, as well as a condemnation of communal and political organization in general. For the latter reason, much has been written on the relationship between The Oasis and the philosophy of McCarthy's longtime friend, historian Hannah Arendt. In “Social Utopia: Hannah Arendt and Mary McCarthy’s The Oasis,” Nicholas Spencer argues that both Arendt and McCarthy are wary of the propensity of political groups towards “altruistic fervor” and injecting their “personal conduct” with “general objectivity”.Spencer. Pg. 52-53. Since neither believes that the convictions of political groups can withstand social and personal pressure enacted by the individuals that compose these groups, both favor a “solitude over solidarity” model. Both Arendt and McCarthy view the role of the group as “anesthetic,” and believe that an individual's “yielding” to facts in the service of “self-alteration” is a superior method of self-improvement than group organizing. This ideology is mirrored by and made manifest in McCarthy's unremitting prose, most evidently in The Oasis.Nelson, Deborah. “The Virtues of Heartlessness: Mary McCarthy, Hannah Arendt, and the Anesthetics of Empathy.”  Critical response  Reception of The Oasis has been historically mixed. Response to the novel's earliest incarnation, in Horizon magazine, was generally positive.Gornick, Vivian. “The Company They Kept.” The New Yorker. American critics, however, were less kind. In a tepid review published by The New York Times, critic Donald Barr wrote, “readers outside [McCarthy’s] circle can get little from The Oasis except a vague sense of defamatory brilliance and a few fine scenes.”Barr, Donald. “Failure in Utopia.” The New York Times. Though Hannah Arendt looked favorably on The Oasis, calling it “a gem,”Grumbach. Pg. 147. many of McCarthy's closest friends were offended by the novel, most notably those who were implicated in the book's plot. Dwight Macdonald called the book “vicious, malicious, and nasty,” while Diana Trilling labeled McCarthy “a thug.”https://www.mhpbooks.com/books/oasis/ Saul Bellow found Rahv's portrayal to be a “stupid caricature,”Wilford. Pg. 218. with Rahv himself threatening to sue McCarthy for libel.Spencer. Pg. 56. The Oasis has experienced something of a resurgence in recent years. Melville House reissued the book in 2013 as part of its Neversink Library series, which “champions books from around the world that have been overlooked, under appreciated, looked askance at, or foolishly ignored.”https://www.mhpbooks.com/series/the-neversink-library/ Additionally, the book has experienced an upswing in scholarly interest over the past thirty years. In her preface to the 2013 edition of The Oasis, Vivian Gornick wrote: > “many American critics… pronounced [The Oasis] brilliant but heartless. They > were wrong. The book is not heartless. It is not out for blood. True, irony > inevitably means some fundamental sympathy is being withheld, but the irony > here is not savage. Its deliciously witty sentence structure is rooted in > the heartfelt disappointment of a moralist whom the reader feels has really > wanted the good (that is, the genuine) in our midst to prevail.”Gornick. > “The Company She Kept.”  Works cited  * Arendt, Hannah, Mary McCarthy, and Carol Brightman.

It runs along the coast of Øresund between Helsingør and Gilleleje, through an area with many holiday homes. The name Hornbækbanen refers to the town Hornbæk about halfway between Helsingør and Gilleleje. The section from Helsingør to Hornbæk opened in 1906, and the section from Hornbæk to Gilleleje in 1916. The railway is currently owned by Hovedstadens Lokalbaner and operated by the railway company Lokaltog. Lokaltog runs frequent local train services from Helsingør station to Gilleleje station with most trains continuing from Gilleleje along the Gribskov Line to Hillerød station.  History  Railcars on the Hornbæk Line at Ålsgårde station in 1973. The first long section of the railway line from Helsingør to Hornbæk opened on 22 May 1906 as the Helsingør-Hornbæk Banen (HHB). Initially, trains on the Hornbæk Line terminated at Grønnehave station in the northern part of Helsingør, but from 1908 all trains were continued via a connecting track along the harbour to Helsingør station, arriving and departing from a special railway halt in the street next to the station building. The next long section from Hornbæk onwards to Gilleleje opened on 11 July 1916 and the railway changed its name to Helsingør-Hornbæk-Gilleleje Banen (HHGB). In 2002, train operation on the Hornbæk Line was transferred from the operating company Helsingør-Hornbæk-Gilleleje Banen A/S (HHGB) to the newly formed railway company Lokalbanen A/S (LB) responsible for train operation on five local railways north of Copenhagen. Lokalbanen A/S merged with Regionstog A/S on 1 July 2015 to form the railway company Lokaltog A/S which is currently responsible for train operation and related passenger services on the Hornbæk Line.  Route  Map of the Hornbæk Line The Hornbæk Line originates from Helsingør station, running north via a connecting track along the harbour to Grønnehave station in the northern part of the city. From Grønnehave station the line continues to the northwest, following the coast line of the Øresund and serving the seaside towns of Ålsgårde, Hornbæk and Dronningmølle. From Dronningmølle the line continues due west, before curving north to reach its terminus at Gilleleje where the line connects with the tracks of the Gribskov Line at Gilleleje station. Operations Trains on the Hornbæk Line at Grønnehave station in Helsingør. Trains on the Hornbæk Line are operated by the railway company Lokaltog. Lokaltog operates a fairly intensive timetable on the Hornbæk Line with light DMUs working a fixed 30-minute frequency most of the day. Most passengers connect from Kystbanen regional trains at Helsingør. Until late 2007, transfers to and from Gribskovbanen were also possible at Gilleleje, but after major changes to Gilleleje station, trains now operate through Gilleleje to Hillerød along Gribskovbanen. This has eliminated the need to change at Gilleleje, but at the cost of going from 20-minute to 30-minute intervals.

Context The station was built by the Midland Railway on the circuitous to line known as The Doe Lea Branch, because it ran for much of its length along the valley of the River Doe Lea. In 1897 the Doe Lea Viaduct was opened, straddling the Doe Lea Branch a short distance to the south of Bolsover Castle station. History The station was opened without ceremony on 1 September 1890 as \\"Bolsover\\". It initially provided a service of three trains each way between Mansfield and Chesterfield, taking about an hour from end to end.The service in 1890 Old Miner The line was single track between Seymour Junction and . Accordingly, the station had a single platform and typical Midland Railway country station building very similar to those at and . Normal passenger traffic along the Doe Lea Branch dwindled over the years and finally ceased on 28 July 1930. An unadvertised service continued to call at the station until 14 August 1931 and pre-war excursions continued until at least 27 July 1939. Records show that a half-day excursion service called at Bolsover on 26 July 1949 on its way to and . The last steam train to use the line was an enthusiasts' special on 16 October 1965. This train also traversed the Clowne Branch. British Railways renamed the station \\"Bolsover Castle\\" on 25 September 1950 to help distinguish it from the ex-LD&ECR; \\"Bolsover\\" which became \\"Bolsover South\\". Goods facilities were withdrawn from the station on 1 November 1962. Although regular passenger traffic ceased in 1930 and the line was severed as a through route shortly thereafter by the closure of Rowthorn Tunnel, occasional specials continued to call at the station. A special was run to Chesterfield in connection with the Queen's Jubilee celebrations in Queen's Park on 28 July 1977. This had been on the initiative of the headmaster of Bolsover Church of England Junior School as there were insufficient buses to take all the children to the event. Thereafter, there were yearly August excursions from 1978 until 1981 organised by Bolsover Miners' Welfare when trains of at least nine coaches ran to Scarborough. Another source claims that the last charter from Bolsover Castle was a nine- coach train to via Chesterfield on 15 November 1980 organised by Bolsover Secondary School PTA. When Glapwell Colliery closed in 1974 the line South of Bolsover Castle station became redundant, though it was not lifted until 1978. The branch between Bolsover Castle and the bottom of Rylah Hill between Palterton and M1 J29 is now a public bridleway known as The Stockley Trail. By 20 July 2013 all tracks through Bolsover Castle station site had been lifted, but the trackbed was intact. The station itself was demolished some years ago. A business park had been developed immediately west of the station site. One occupant is a firm providing road-rail vehicles, such as track welding lorries fitted with retractable rail wheels. A length of track with dummy overhead wires, presumably for training and clearance testing purposes, has been installed in their depot in plain view from public areas. Possible future The line from Foxlow Junction through Seymour Junction to Oxcroft Disposal Point has been lifted but protected from breach or encroachment as there remains the possibility of opencasting in the area. For example, in 2005 UK Coal (now Coalfield Resources), expressed an interest in extracting c530,000 tons near Mastin Moor. The Doe Lea line South from Seymour Junction to the site of the former Markham Colliery (now known as \\"The Bolsover Branch\\") has been mothballed as it runs through the new Markham Vale Enterprise Zone at M1 Junction 29A. The track is in place, but at 20 July 2013 has trees taller than a man growing though the sleepers in places. It is hoped that someone will invest in this infrastructure to create road-rail interchange facilities. The line through Clowne has been lifted, but it, too remains protected from breach or encroachment as it, too, might provide access to Markham Vale from a different direction.

He was educated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, and was a lawyer.The History of Parliament, MOMPESSON, Roger (c.1661-1715), of Lincoln’s Inn, London and Durnford, Dorset He was appointed Recorder of Southampton in May 1668, and was elected to Parliament in 1669. Mompesson served as MP for Southampton until the election of November 1701, when he lost his seat. He did not stand for election in 1702. In 1703 his recordership was declared void due to neglect. Mompesson had become involved in engagements to pay some debts incurred by his father; this placed him in an embarrassing situation. In April 1703 he accepted an appointment as Judge of the Vice Admiralty for Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania. As he was appointed Chief Justice of New York in July 1704 he gave up four of the colonies, retaining New York, New Jersey and Connecticut until his death in 1715.

Choi is a chef who is celebrated for \\"food that isn't fancy\\" and is known as one of the founders of the gourmet food truck movement. In 2019, Choi began presenting a cooking series on Netflix with Jon Favreau titled The Chef Show.  Early life  Choi was born in Seoul, South Korea, to South Korean father Soo Myung Choi and North Korean mother Jai Nam Choi. Choi's parents met in the US but after marrying moved back to Korea. The family ended up emigrating from South Korea permanently in 1972. Choi was raised in Los Angeles and southern California. As Choi grew up, his parents had many businesses: a liquor store, dry-cleaning shop, a Korean restaurant, and after selling jewelry door to door, finally a successful jewelry company. His parents owned a Korean restaurant called Silver Garden in Anaheim, California for three years when he was young. Choi's mother made kimchi that was so popular within their community that they packaged it and sold it locally. His favorite childhood memory is making dumplings at the age of eight at his family's own restaurant. The family moved many times while he was young. His family once lived near Olympic Boulevard and Vermont Avenue, as well as in South Central, the Crenshaw District and West Hollywood. Choi attended a gifted-students program, but changed schools in his early teens when his parents achieved prosperity in the jewelry business and moved their family into a neighborhood in Orange County called Villa Park, Choi began getting into trouble, with his marks slipping as he began taking drugs and hanging out with a bad crowd. At age 15, Choi's parents sent him to Southern California Military Academy in Signal Hill, California. He remembers this as a good experience. After high school, Choi went to Korea and taught English there. He then attended California State University, Fullerton, graduating with a bachelor's degree in philosophy. Choi attended Western State University law school, and dropped out after one semester. At 24, confused about his life, and in a dark period around 1994 or 1995, Choi said he became obsessed with Emeril Lagasse's \\"Essence of Emeril\\" show. The show inspired him to enroll in culinary school. \\"Emeril saved my life,\\" Choi said. In 1996, Choi began studying at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. He enjoyed the highly structured block programs, where there was no \\"wiggle room.\\" He worked during this period as an intern at Le Bernardin in New York City.  Career  Choi gained experience as a journeyman hotel chef since the mid-1990s. In 2001, he started working for Hilton Hotels. After being promoted within the company, in 2007, Choi became chef de cuisine at the Beverly Hilton. It was there that Choi met his future business partner, Mark Manguera. Choi also worked at the Embassy Suites in Sacramento and the Rock Sugar Pan Asian Kitchen in Los Angeles. After this classical training and years of background in four and five star cooking, Choi said that the shift to the food trucks, initially based on Abbot Kinney Boulevard in Venice was great. Choi's company, Kogi, was founded in 2008 with partners Mark Manguera and his wife, Caroline Shin-Manguera. He was named one of the top ten \\"Best New Chefs\\" of 2010 by Food and Wine magazine, and is the first food truck operator to win that distinction. Choi currently runs Sunny Spot, in Venice, CA, which is Caribbean-inspired. He ran the Los Angeles-area restaurant Chego! which featured rice bowls, and A-Frame which conveyed the Hawaiian idea of aloha and was built in a former IHOP, in addition to Pot at the Line Hotel in Koreatown. In December, 2018, Choi opened a restaurant named Best Friend in Las Vegas, NV. His cooking style fuses Mexican and Korean flavors and dishes. In June 2013, Choi along with fellow chefs Wolfgang Puck and David Chang, convened at the Hotel Bel-Air to fuse different styles such as ggaejjang style and kochujang onto the Hotel Bel-Air menu. In November 2013, Choi released his autobiography that is part memoir part cookbook called L.A. Son: My Life, My City, My Food. Choi said he didn't start out to write a book, but that he kept getting asked the same questions about his food, its flavors, and how it is prepared. While Choi doesn't see the book as social commentary, he felt it was important to show the \\"real deal\\" of the duality he felt growing up as an immigrant in the 1970s; the foods served in the restaurant were quite different from what the family ate at home. The book also talks about the culture of Los Angeles and how it has changed since the 1970s. The Jon Favreau movie Chef (2014) was loosely inspired by Choi and the food truck movement. Choi worked as a technical advisor to Favreau on cooking and restaurant scenes and appears in the end credits. In addition to touring all of Choi's restaurants, Favreau attended a French culinary school and trained in several of Choi's kitchens. In 2019, Favreau and Choi collaborated on a cooking show on Netflix: The Chef Show. Time had included Choi in their TIME 100 list of the most influential people in the world for 2011 and 2016. Fellow chef and author Anthony Bourdain wrote that \\"Roy Choi first changed the world when he elevated the food-truck concept from \\"roach coach\\" to highly sought-after, ultra-hot-yet-democratic rolling restaurant.\\" In 2015, Choi and chef Daniel Patterson opened a restaurant called LocoL in Watts, Los Angeles, with the goal of bringing quality, healthy, and inspired fast-food to inner- city neighborhoods. In 2019, Choi produced and hosted a TV series, Broken Bread on Tastemade and KCET in Los Angeles.  Personal life  Choi goes by the nicknames \\"Papi\\" and \\"El Guapo.\\" He teaches cooking when he volunteers at A Place Called Home in South Los Angeles. Choi is a supporter of 3 Worlds Cafe, a South Central community coffee and smoothie shop that is a collaboration between Choi, the neighborhood-based Coalition for Responsible Community Development, fruit conglomerate Dole Packaged Foods and nearby Jefferson High School. He also maintains a blog on which he posts recipes and rants. During his difficult teen years and later as a young adult, Choi said he had many addictions. He was addicted to crack for a short time, marijuana and gambling, which lasted three years in his early 20s. Choi says that his current addiction is feeding people. Choi has a daughter.

Bion-M was launched into orbit at 10:00 UTC on April 19, 2013, from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, with 6 small satellites, including OSSI-1. OSSI-1 detached from Bion-M at 16:15 UTC. OSSI-1 is the pet project of Hojun Song, a Korean artist and amateur radio operator. He worked on it for seven years, designing and building the satellite using off-the-shelf components rather than equipment that had been certified for use in space. The most expensive aspect of the project was the launch, which cost US$100,000. OSSI-1 is a 1U CubeSat with 100mm sides, weighing 950g. It uses an arduino microcontroller, a lithium-ion battery and a J mode UHF/VHF transceiver. The satellite has a Morse code beacon transmitting \\"OS0 DE OSSI1 ANYOUNG\\" on 145.980 MHz and 4 LED lights with a total power of 44 watts to flash Morse code messages, using an open protocol. The project developers announced on 24 April 2013 that they had not yet received a signal from the satellite and were concerned that the Two-line element set they were using to locate the satellite might be wrong. According to Korean amateur radio organisation KARL, Hojun Song had some difficulties launching a satellite as a private individual, connected to registering with space bodies and being allocated broadcast frequencies by the international telecoms regulator the ITU. A law requires knowledge of the launch date two years in advance which he was not able to give as he was sharing a launch with other experimental satellites. The amateur radio bands are nearly full but to use other bands would require more expensive specialist equipment and technical skills. In 2011 OSSI-1 signed a contract with a French nano satellite company for a turnkey launch service in order to secure a launch date. The satellite re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on 30 June 2013.

He was among the first settlers of Santa Fe, New Mexico.  Early life  Francisco Gomes was born in 1576 in Villa de Coima, Portugal. He was the son of Manuel Gomes and Ana Vicente and became an orphan at an early age. He was then raised in Lisbon by his only brother, Franciscan Alvaro (or Alonso) Gomes, who worked as a high sheriff of the Holy Office of the Inquisition.Fray Angélico Chávez. Origins of New Mexico Families. Pages 35-37. His family was probably of noble origin.Parientes - Founders of the Villa de Santa Fe #6 The Gómez-Robledo Family . Written by José Antonio Esquibel. Gomes resided for a time in Madrid at the house of Alonso de Oñate (who was brother of Juan de Oñate). This placed him in the court of King Philip II during the king's illness. Gomes probably lived there until the death of king in 1598.  Career  In 1604, De Oñate took him to Mexico City. There, Gomes contributed to the formation of a colony led by De Oñate. The next year, Gomes moved to New Mexico and joined the military. He ascended to the position of sergeant and eventually became the most prominent military officers in the colony. In 1610, during his military service, he co-founded the town of Santa Fe where he and his family resided. He was also a rancher and a farmer. In 1641, the governor of New Mexico, Juan Flores de Sierra, appointed him as interim governor while De Sierra was on his deathbed. Although Gomes was rejected by the Board of New Mexico, he continued to govern. He finished his term in 1642. Gomes had a falling out with some of the friars who had power, causing political friction. He was accused of having Jewish heritage. It was believed that he secretly practiced Judaism. He died in Santa Fe around 1656–1657.  Personal life and legacy  Gomes married Ana Robledo Romero in 1626 in San Gabriel. He married her to get land as a dowry. Gomez and Romero had seven children: * Francisca (a daughter and probably the eldest of their children) * Francisco (the eldest son, born circa 1628 in Santa Fe), * Bartolomé (born circa 1639), * Juan (birth date unknown), * Andrés (born circa 1643), * José (born circa 1645) * Ana Gómes Robledo (birth date unknown). Gomes' son, Francisco, was a sergeant, and like his father, he was accused of being a Jew. He was incarcerated in a Franciscan friary, and his property was confiscated. However, later he was acquitted in January 1655. Gomes possessed substantial pasture land. He received land grants in San Juan Pueblo, Taos Pueblo, Tesuque Pueblo and a fourth located south of Isleta Pueblo in San Nicolas de las Barrancas. In addition to his role as an encomendero, Gomes was honored in at least eight village communities, among which were Pecos, New Mexico, Tesuque, and Taos. As a token of his appreciation, Gomes subsidized military campaigns, deployed horses and allocated supplies to Spanish soldiers and their Pueblo Native American allies. The complaint leveled by the Franciscans against Francisco Gomes reduced the economic and political power of his family (although, later, the family regained its status). Unfortunately, most of the records were lost with the Pueblo Revolt in August 1680.

J. Molloy (born 1989) is an American sportsperson. As a Gaelic footballer he has played for New York in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. Early life and education Son of Connie Molloy, a manager of and former player with the New York team, he is a native of Hawthorne, which is about thirty miles north of Manhattan. He is the nephew of Anthony Molloy, the 1992 All-Ireland winning captain. As a boy he spent summers in Donegal, Galway and Tralee. Molloy received a basketball scholarship from Union College located three and a half hours away. However, he returned to the Bronx three times each week for football training. He ultimately gave up basketball after a few months to concentrate on his football. He studied at Union College between 2007 and 2011, completing a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science and Government. He completed a Master of Business Administration in Management at Iona College between 2012 and 2014. Playing career Molloy played for New York teams in the All-Ireland Feile Under-14 competitions in 2002 in Carlow and in 2003 in Galway. Molloy made his New York senior debut in 2008 in a game against Leitrim. He was sent off in 2013 as New York exited the Championship against Leitrim, who were returning to the Bronx for the first time since then. He played in the 2012 All Stars match and scored a goal. He met Donegal manager Jim McGuinness, there with the team; McGuinness invited Molloy to Donegal. Molloy flew to Donegal. He participated with the Donegal county team from his arrival in mid-February 2014 but parted from them in 2015 struggling with injuries. When Molloy moved to Ireland, he went to play for his uncle's club, Ardara. He had never played for them until this time. He has been club captain. In 2016, Molloy appeared in a Street Gaelic football video — Peil Star 2 — with Dublin players Shane Carthy and Diarmuid Connolly. In the video, Connolly kicks a football across the River Liffey in Dublin. He scored a contender for goal of the season against reigning Senior Football Champions Glenswilly in 2017, though his team lost the match. Directly from the second- half throw-in, he soloed through the Glenswilly defence and kicked the ball into the net from a distance of around 25 yards. He was at McCann Fitzgerald between April 2016 and February 2018 when he moved to the Sanne group. He spent the period between September 2015 and March 2016 at Maples and Calder in Dublin, having before that been at Wilson Esler between 2011 and 2013. He has sustained a cruciate injury.

It opened in 1977 and was owned by Marion Collins throughout its existence. The Collins family helped start the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series (then- Craftsman SuperTruck Series) in 1995, and hosted nine races in that series at the track between 1995 and 2003. Mesa Marin also hosted 45 races for the Winston West Series and for NASCAR's Southwest Tour. The last race was held at Mesa Marin on October 16, 2005, as the track was sold for a housing development to be constructed on the site. Many of Mesa Marin's events were broadcast on television, including the 1995 Craftsman Truck Series race on ABC's Wide World of Sports and the NCTS on The Nashville Network and later ESPN. Local races were featured, as well as both the NASCAR West Series and Southwest Tour (sanction of that tour changed to SRL in 2007), on Speed Channel and HDNet. It ran NASCAR-sanctioned local racing, including the NASCAR Camping World Series West, United States Auto Club open-wheel racing, the NASCAR Southwest Tour, and other notable local racing. Nearly 4 million spectators attended Mesa Marin Raceway during the track's 28-year existence. Marion Collins announced on June 8, 2005 that he would sell Mesa Marin Raceway to a local developer when the city refused to renew the tracks conditional use permit, following noise complaints from people living around the racetrack in housing built after the racetrack was built. The developer was to build new houses on the site of the racetrack, similar to the fates of Ontario Motor Speedway and Riverside International Raceway (now the city of Moreno Valley). Collins stated that he and his family wanted to change routes after 28 years of owning the track. The last races were held at Mesa Marin on October 16, 2005, which included participation by NASCAR driver Kevin Harvick. The track was replaced by Kern County Raceway Park, located about 30 miles west of where Mesa Marin had stood. In 2011, the Bakersfield Park District opened Mesa Marin Sports Complex on the site where the raceway had stood. As of 2015 the complex includes four ASA/USSSA regulation softball fields and is zoned for more facilities to be added at a later date. Role in Craftsman Truck Series formation Mesa Marin was critical to the formation of the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series. The track was the site for design, construction and testing of the prototype NASCAR Craftsman Trucks. Gary Collins, son of track owner Marion Collins (and himself a former racer), led the team of designers and fabricators who built the first truck. The track hosted nine NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series events between 1995 and 2003, with Dennis Setzer winning the final race at Mesa Marin, hosted on March 23, 2003.

Born in England, he went with his family while still young to New England. He returned to England under the Commonwealth, went to Scotland after a period at Oxford, and became a Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin. After 1662 he was a nonconformist minister in Ireland. Biography Samuel Mather was the eldest son of Richard Mather. He was born at Much Woolton (now Woolton), near Liverpool, Lancashire, on 13 May 1626. His father took him in 1635 to New England, where he was educated at Harvard College and graduated M.A. in 1643, becoming a fellow of the College. He was the first fellow of Harvard who had graduated there. Having already become a preacher, Mather returned to England, and in 1650 was made one of the chaplains of Magdalen College, Oxford, under the presidency of Thomas Goodwin, the Independent. He is said to have been incorporated M.A.; of this there is no record in the register. He frequently preached at St. Mary's. In 1653 Mather resigned his chaplaincy, having been appointed to attend the parliamentary commissioners who journeyed to Scotland to proclaim and implement the Tender of Union. He was at Leith, for two years, exercising his ministry, but without regular charge. Returning to England, Mather is said to have been incorporated M.A. at Cambridge. He went over to Ireland soon after with Henry Cromwell. He was incorporated M.A. of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1654, and appointed one of the senior fellows. On 5 December 1656 he was ordained in the Church of St. Nicholas Within, Dublin, by Samuel Winter, provost of Trinity, Timothy Taylor of Carrickfergus, and Thomas Jenner (born 1606/7) of Drogheda, all Independents. He was morning preacher at St. Nicholas's, and preached once in six weeks as chaplain to the lord-deputy. Wood commends him for his civility to episcopal divines; he declined to act on commissions for displacing them in Munster and Dublin. At the Restoration he was suspended (October 1660) for sermons against the revival of the ceremonies. Crossing to England he obtained the perpetual curacy of Burtonwood, Lancashire, a poor chapelry with a wooden chapel, in the parish of Warrington. From this he was ejected by the Uniformity Act 1662. He went back to Dublin and gathered a congregation, which met at his house till a meeting- house was erected in New Row. He was arrested on 18 September, and imprisoned on 20 September 1664 for preaching at a private conventicle, but soon released. A pressing call came to him from Boston, Massachusetts, which he declined. He died in Dublin on 29 October 1671, and was buried in St. Nicholas's Church. Works He published: * A Wholesome Caveat for a Time of Liberty, &c.;, 1652, 4to. * A Defence of the Protestant Religion, &c.;, Dublin, 1671, 4to. Posthumous (both published by his brother Nathaniel): * An Irenicum: or an Essay for Union among Reformers, &c.;, 1680, 4to. * The Figures or Types of the Old Testament, &c.;, Dublin, 1683, 4to He wrote also a \\"Discourse\\" against Valentine Greatrakes, the miraculous conformist, but it was not allowed to be printed. Family Mather married a sister of Sir John Stephens. They had four or five children but all but one, Catherine, died while still minors.

Rider Haggard, published in 1919. It deals with the adventures of Bastin, Bickley, and Arbuthnot as they travel to the south sea island of Orofena.When the world shook Del Ray books, 1978 Plot summary The story begins as the main character, Humphrey Arbuthnot—a writer of adventure stories—is married to his wife Natalie. Shortly thereafter, she claims that she is going to die soon even though she has been given a clean bill of health from their doctor, Bickley. Right as Natalie dies, she tells Arbuthnot that soon he will want to travel somewhere, and that is where the two shall meet again. Natalie dies, and shortly thereafter Arbuthnot has a sudden urge to travel to the Pacific islands. He gets on a yacht with two friends, Bickley, a doctor, Bastin, a minister, and Arbuthnot's dog, Tommy. The craft is then taken by a cyclone after all the crew abandons ship. When the three adventurers awaken, they find themselves shipwrecked on the South Sea island of Orofena. Here they meet the Orofenan people who worship a God called Oro. The men win the love of the Orofenans as Bickley teaches the men western medicine techniques and saves a few lives. They are told not to go to a part of the island named Orofena which is a volcano. After a dispute in which Bickley destroys a symbol of Oro and kills one of the natives who was about to be sacrificed. They flee to a small volcanic island in the center of a lake at the center of the island of Orofena. The men search a cave in the side of the volcano and find two crystal coffins with two people in them. First they revive an old man who is the original Oro. Next they revive his daughter Yva. After being revived, Oro makes astronomical observations to confirm by stellar movements that he and his daughter have been unconscious for 250,000 years. Yva claims they know the position of the stars as they came from a society that was filled with wisdom known as the age of wisdom. To describe what the age of wisdom was like, Yva conjures up scenes from the age of wisdom by showing the men a hallucination of the past. As the men are talking about the modern age and learning about the age of wisdom, each of the men attempts to court Yva. It is revealed that Yva will only marry a man from her own era who was killed by her father. She intimates to Arbuthnot that she has the soul of Natalie inside her, and that he is a reincarnation of her lost love. She falls in love with Arbuthnot, and they decide to be married. Using a form of remote viewing or astral projection, Oro forces Arbuthnot to show him the current state of the world, including events taking place in England and France (where World War I is ongoing). After forming a negative view of humanity in this era based on these events, he decides to destroy half the world so that he may rule the surviving remainder of humanity and create a new golden age. He prepares a ritual which will make an earthquake that will destroy the whole world. Yva sacrifices herself to prevent Oro's plan, thus saving millions of human beings from death. Brokenhearted, Oro allows the men to escape the island, and eventually they return home to England. Once home, they wonder if Oro was telling the truth the whole time or if he was a madman. The story ends after Humphery Arbuthnot, along with Tommy, dies, and they are buried next to Natalie. Notes External links *When the World Shook at Project Gutenberg Category:Novels by H.

This form of investment is essential for traders and investment professionals to branch out their portfolio assets. For a majority of businesses in this modern economic situation, counting on the stability of a financial transaction is not always a viable option. Hybrid Investments work to maintain a sense of security for both the business and investor. Types of Hybrid Investments The two most popular types of Hybrid Investments are Preferred Stock and Convertible Bonds. Preferred Stocks – Stockholders acquire dividend payments on a regular basis and gain funds when share values rise on security exchanges. Convertible Bonds – Bondholders periodically receive interest payments. An exchange of bonds for a specified number of equity shares is acceptable, but only in accordance with the convertible bond covenant. Hybrid investments are essential to our current economic transactions. Investors buying these products generally wish to accumulate periodic fixed-interest payments and profit when share prices rise in financial markets. New types of Hybrid Investments are constantly being introduced to meet the needs of professional investors.

Currently, its mission statement, “Ideals of the 21st Century,” is to create a more humane and sustainable society through the efforts of the cooperative members in the form of business operations and through their involvement with the community History of Consumer Cooperatives in Japan Cooperative societies in Japan were initiated during the era of Taishō democracy. In 1900, the Industrial Association Law was enacted and under its provisions consumer cooperatives like Nada Consumer Cooperative and Kobe Consumer Cooperative were formed. During the Shōwa period, cooperative movements came to a halt due to the increase economic control of the government and the compulsory military drafts for war. At the end of WWII in 1945, severe food shortages and inflation stimulated the growth and expansion of cooperatives once again. In 1948, the Consumer Cooperative Law replaced the Industrial Association Law of 1900 which provided limitations on the operation of consumer cooperative societies within prefectures and prevented the merger of cooperatives across prefecture borders. In 1951, Toyohiko Kagawa founded the Japanese Consumers' Cooperative Union, or JCCU, which was established to represent and serve all the consumers' cooperative societies of Japan. Membership Following the 1948 Consumer Cooperative Law, individuals are only allowed to join consumer cooperative societies in the prefecture in which they resided. In addition, membership comes through the payment of a subscription, which is used for business operations. Whenever a member decides to leave the total amount of their investments are returned. Businesses Retailing These consumer cooperative societies consist of store operation, home delivery, catalog, and internet businesses. All which are involved with the sale of food and other necessities to its members. Insurance Cooperatives These cooperatives offer life and other insurance products that suit the members' needs. The two insurance cooperatives under the JCCU include Japan CO-OP Insurance Consumers' Cooperative Federation (JCIF) and National Federation of Workers and Consumers Insurance Cooperative (ZENROSAI). Coop Sanchoku This cooperative society follows the community-supported agriculture philosophy developed by the Japanese Consumer Cooperative in the early 1970s. They promote safe food production and address agricultural problems from urbanization by creating good quality and safe products. They continue to adapt their products based on the responses of society and the lifestyle of the consumers. Involvement with the Community Cooperative members are involved in the community through their social activities. These include social care, pursuing food safety, providing dietary education, child-rearing support, and peace actions.

Indications The procedure is a surgical option for individuals who are at high risk for the development of breast cancer. Women who had a bilateral mastectomy in 2013 were about 10 years younger than those who had a unilateral mastectomy. This preventive operation pertains to women with these characteristics: * BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers; this is the main indication for bilateral prophylactic mastectomy. * Cancer in one breast and a family history of breast cancer. * Family history of breast cancer. The genetic risk can be passed down through the mother’s or father’s side. * Radiation therapy to the chest before the age of 30. * Presence of lobular carcinoma in situ. * Having dense breasts or breasts with diffuse microcalcification, as the screening for breast cancer is made difficult. Discussions and decision should be made with the help of specialists who can use relevant information and statistical models to predict the individual lifetime risk of development of breast cancer. Undergoing a preventive mastectomy does not guarantee that breast cancer will not develop later, however, it reduces the risk by 90% in high risk women. Also, a preventive mastectomy may not be able to remove all breast tissue as some of it may be in the arm pit, near the collar bone, or in the abdominal wall. Male carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations have a higher risk of breast cancer than other males, approximately 1.2% and 6.8%, but their risk is much lower than in female mutation carriers (about 60%) and lower than in the general female population (12%). Thus, preventive mastectomy has not been advocated for affected men. Procedure In most situations the operation involves both breasts and thus represents a bilateral procedure. When cancer has affected already one breast, the other breast, still healthy, may be removed in a unilateral preventive mastectomy. Typically either a simple, a subcutaneous or a nipple-sparing mastectomy is performed. With the former the areola and nipple are removed, while the other two approaches preserve the nipple area for cosmetic reasons. To increase the viability of the nipple area for preservation during mastectomy, a so-called \\"nipple delay\\" procedure can be done several weeks before the mastectomy. Reconstructive breast surgery can be performed in the same surgical setting, added after the mastectomy. Saline or silicone implants may be used in the reshaping process and may be placed in a later setting. A preventive mastectomy carries certain risks including those of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, disfiguration, anxiety and disappointment. After surgery, routine screening for breast cancer is recommended. Alternatives There are other options to reduce the risk of future breast cancer. Intensified breast cancer screening for high risk women may detect cancer at an early, treatable stage. Certain medications that block the effect of estrogen (i.e. tamoxifen, raloxifen, exemestane) can reduce the risk by about 50% but also have side effects. Prophylactic salpingo- oophorectomy reduces estrogen levels and the risk of both ovarian and breast cancer, however, the reduction in breast cancer risk is about 50% in high risk women as compared to 90% when preventive mastectomy is done. Lifestyle changes (in weight, diet, exercise, avoidance of smoking, limiting alcohol) may reduce the risk to some degree. Acceptance A factor that facilitates the decision to undergo a preventive mastectomy is that results of breast reconstructive surgery have improved. A 2004 Canadian study found that 70% of women were satisfied or extremely satisfied with the reconstruction after bilateral prophylactic mastectomy. In the United States preventive mastectomy is gaining increased acceptance. The decision of famous actresses such as Christina Applegate and Angelina Jolie to undergo preventive mastectomy has given the procedure wider media attention. The trend towards prophylactic mastectomy appears to be less pronounced in Europe and India.

He later served as a high-ranking official in the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. He had the reputation of being a model governor, valiant, loyal and wise. He was the grandfather of Du Yu, the author of the most influential Zuo Zhuan commentary, who gave the work its modern form.Schaberg, 323 Early career Du Ji was from Duling County (), Jingzhao Commandery (), which is in present-day southeastern Xi'an, Shaanxi. When he was 19, he served in the convict labour section under the magistrate of Zheng County (鄭縣; present-day Hua County, Shaanxi). He personally saw all of the hundreds of convicts in the county prisons, weighed the severity of their transgressions, and despatched them to their labours accordingly. Following this, he was nominated as a xiaolian and appointed as a fucheng (府丞; an aide) in the Hanzhong stores office.Records of the Three Kingdoms, 16.494 Towards the end of the Han dynasty, Du Ji abandoned his post and fled south to Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan). He returned to the north sometime between 196 and 205, and was recommended to Cao Cao by Xun Yu. Du Ji was appointed as a Director of Justice () to under the Minister of Works (then held by Cao Cao), then sent west to Xiping Commandery (西平郡; present-day Xining, Qinghai) to serve as the commandery's Administrator () and as Colonel Who Protects the Qiang (). In 205, Gao Gan, a northern warlord and adopted nephew of Yuan Shao, rebelled against Cao Cao, to whom he had surrendered years earlier. Gao Gan convinced Wang Yi (), the Administrator of Hedong Commandery (), to join him in the rebellion. Two other men from Hedong Commandery, Wei Gu () and Fan Xian (), claimed to have liberated cities for Cao Cao, while conspiring with Gao Gan. The loss of Hedong Commandery greatly troubled Cao Cao, who saw its strategic location as critical to controlling China, and worried that the rebels could cause serious harm if they were to ally with Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province, to their south. He asked Xun Yu to recommend him a great general the likes of Xiao He or Kou Xun (), who substantially assisted the careers of the Han dynasty emperors Gaozu and Guangwu respectively. Xun Yu cautiously recommended Du Ji. As the Administrator of Hedong Commandery Cao Cao appointed Du Ji as the Administrator of Hedong Commandery, so Wei Gu and Fan Xian sent several thousand soldiers to close the ford of Shanjin (陝津; northeast of present-day Sanmenxia, Henan), one of the three major fords across the Yellow River, and only route into Hedong from an area still under Cao Cao's control. Du Ji was unable to cross the river, so Cao Cao sent a large force under Xiahou Dun to attack the rebel forces. Rather than waiting for Xiahou Dun's forces to crush the Hedong rebels, Du Ji chose to use subterfuge. At a smaller ford, he crossed the river alone, and granted Wei Gu and Fan Xian high military commands and civil offices in Hedong Commandery's administration. He proceeded to convince them that they had to move slowly in order to win over the people of Hedong, so they kept their forces in check for several weeks. Afterwards, Du Ji proposed that the generals, aides and clerks be permitted to visit their homes to see their families, and Wei Gu and Fan Xian allowed this, for fear of alienating the populace.Records of the Three Kingdoms, 16.495 Thus the rebel forces in Hedong lacked all middle and lower management, and Wei Gu and Fan Xian stayed put, training their troops while rebellion spread in adjacent commanderies. Having hollowed out the effectiveness of the rebel army from inside, Du Ji took his leave, accompanied by a few dozen horsemen. In a few weeks' time, he had mustered a force of over four thousand. Wei Gu's forces, along with Gao Gan and Zhang Sheng (), attacked Du Ji but could not dislodge him. When Xiahou Dun's army arrived, Gao Gan and Zhang Sheng fled, while Wei Gu and Fan Xian were executed. Du Ji pardoned their assistants and conspirators, and sent them back to their old occupations. Thus it was that in the chaotic collapse of the Han dynasty, Hedong was one of the first commanderies stabilised under Cao Cao's rule, and with the least wasted effort and resources.Records of the Three Kingdoms, 16.496 As the commandery's Administrator, Du Ji promoted lenience and mercy, and aided the populace by exerting as little control over them as possible. When someone impeached him or spoke out against him, Du Ji would have the person summoned and explain to them his plans, with the command to think them over thoroughly. If there was something the person still did not understand, Du Ji would summon them again to explain more clearly. The local elders were greatly amenable to this policy, and quickly accepted Du Ji as a model governor. He would exempt particularly filial sons and dutiful wives from state labour, and taught improved farming methods to increase harvests. This achieved, he began teaching martial arts in the winters, and had the people keep their weaponry in good order. He opened a school where he personally taught from the Chinese classics. In 211, Han Sui and Ma Chao drew up armies against Cao Cao in response to a suspected invasion of their lands. Cities throughout Hongnong and Fengyi commanderies rose in support, while Hedong Commandery remained firmly loyal, despite adjacency to the rebels. When Cao Cao marched west to confront them, his army was fed entirely by grain from Hedong, and after defeating Han Sui and Ma Chao there were still in excess of 4,000 hectolitres of grain left over.Loewe, 65 Cao Cao increased Du Ji's salary after this. When Cao Cao was enfeoffed as the Duke of Wei by Emperor Xian in 213, he appointed Du Ji as a Master of Writing (). Two years later, Cao Cao invaded Hanzhong Commandery and Du Ji sent 5,000 men to join Cao Cao's army in the campaign. According to the Records of the Three Kingdoms, his soldiers were so loyal that not a single person from the Hedong battalion fled from combat.Records of the Three Kingdoms, 16.497 Cao Cao again compared Du Ji to Xiao He and Kou Xun, and said Hedong was like a limb to him. Throughout the 16 years Du Ji governed Hedong Commandery, it was the most stable among all the commanderies in China at the time. Service under Cao Pi In 220, after Cao Cao's death, his son and successor Cao Pi, summoned Du Ji to Luoyang to serve as a Master of Writing (), in addition to enfeoffing him as a Secondary Marquis (). Later that year, Cao Pi usurped the throne from Emperor Xian and ended the Han dynasty, after which he declared himself emperor of the state of Wei. After ascending the throne, Cao Pi promoted Du Ji from a Secondary Marquis to a village marquis under the title \\"Marquis of Fengle Village\\" (), with a marquisate comprising 100 taxable households. More substantially, Du Ji was appointed Colonel-Director of Retainers (), the executive officer in charge of the area surrounding the imperial capital and one of the most powerful positions in the civil bureaucracy. In 222, Cao Pi led the Wei armies to invade Wei's rival state, Eastern Wu, in 222. He also promoted Du Ji to the position of Supervisor of the Masters of Writing (), entrusting him with administrating state affairs during the expedition. Two years later, when Cao Pi travelled to Xuchang, he left matters in Luoyang in Du Ji's hands again. In 224, Cao Pi ordered Du Ji to assist in building his fleet for attacking Eastern Wu. Du Ji was in charge of the imperial tower ship, the fleet's central flagship. While testing the ship on the Tao River (), Du Ji's crew encountered heavy winds and the ship sank. Du Ji drowned in the river. Cao Pi is said to have wept upon hearing news of Du Ji's death, and wrote that he \\"epitomised loyalty\\". Du Ji was posthumously granted the office of Minister Coachman (), which his son Du Shu () inherited. Historiography The only surviving source for Du Ji's biographical information is the Records of the Three Kingdoms, in which his life history is related unusually hagiographically. Conversations with no possible recorders are presented, and Du Ji is portrayed as a perfect, sagely governor who taught his subjects industry, culture and loyalty to the death. This is perhaps one of the faults of the Records of the Three Kingdoms inherited from the Book of Wei,Qu, 252 whose authors would have been sensitive to the fact that Du Ji's grandson was the emperor's uncle.

His work has achieved international recognition and is a staple in many modern design and art shows, and has been featured in the prestigious California Design series and at the Craft and Folk Art Museum as part of Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945–1980. His career in ceramics has spanned six decades. His large scale works include ceramic wall murals, sculptures, fountains, and garden pathways. These installations have been featured in several design publications, and can still be experienced in public spaces, banks, hotels, schools, churches, industrial complexes, and private residences. His influence has been present in California architecture since the 1960s. Bitters received his Bachelor of Arts degree in painting from University of California Los Angeles in 1959. He also attended the Otis College of Art and Design in Los Angeles where he studied under Peter Voulkos. In 1959 he went to work for Hans Sumpf, an adobe brick manufacturer in Madera, California that perfected the process of manufacturing emulsified adobe bricks. Bitters was the company’s resident artist hired to create pottery and other ceramic art. While at Hans Sumpf, Bitters created architectural murals, tiles, bird houses, planters and sculptural objects – designs that would earn him recognition later on as a pioneer of the organic modernist craft movement. He left the company in 1965.  Birdhouses  Stan Bitters vintage birdhouses. These porous, lowfire clay pieces have a direct connection to Peter Voulkos. By his own account, Bitters said that while a student at Otis, he chanced upon Voulkos sitting in his studio and then proceeded to ask him how to throw a sphere on a potter’s wheel. Bitters took this knowledge with him when he later joined Hans Sumpf and produce birdhouses.  Elevating pots and planters to art  Bitters is also known for his thumb pots. He has raised what was once humble, decorative and functional into objects of art by applying all the elements of formal art. Bitters’ pots and planters are distinctively earthy and textural and it is easy to overlook at texture, while a hallmark of his work, “is only one of the elements,” according to Bitters. “The surface of the container must be treated in attitude like a painting involving the variation of a theme, thick and thin line, color, relationships of form, scale, proportion, calligraphy, texture, and finally, the organization of all these elements into a single statement. All the elements of formal art may be found in pots” (Bitters 1976, p. 48).Bitter, Stan. Environmental Ceramics. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, 1976.  Organic sculpture  In his book Environmental Ceramics, Bitters says that “Clay assumes powerful form in sculpture. Because of its responsive nature and its receptivity to impressions, clay is open to tremendous variety of sculptural approaches, and can be worked additively and subtractively with equal ease. Its visual mass gives it an earthy, weighty character in contrast to the liquid nature of glass or the linear character of welded steel in which a massive piece may appear to be much lighter than it is. The immediacy with which clay can be worked gives the sculpture great energy. Clay accepts and emits emotional power” (Bitters 1976, p. 77).  Murals  The scope of ceramics covers more than just pottery. Technically, clay that has been fired in a kiln is considered ceramic. As such, brick, mosaic, and tile fall all under this category. Perhaps no other artist has been as prolific as Bitters in the creation of monumental ceramic wall murals. His architectural installations adorn many commercial and residential buildings in California, such as the 22-foot tall indoor ceramic fountain environment inside the Stanislaus County Administrative Building, Modesto, California. and a group of two-story fireplaces at the Ace Hotel in Palm Springs, California.  Environmental ceramics  Throughout his career, Bitters has steadfastly expressed the important role of sculpture in urban environment. He believes in integration of art and architecture – a notion foreign to contemporary urban development. (The union of these two fields was never in question in the early days of Greece and Rome and through the Middle Ages.) This disjunction is attributed to a lack of trust. In the book Walls: Enrichment and Ornamenation, which features Bitters’ ceramic wall murals, David Van Dommelen says that “the architect had a tendency to be afraid of the artist and the craftsman. The architect wanted to remain an entity to himself; he feared a lack of understanding on the part of the craftsman and artist; and he suspected that they would not wish to remain anonymous as they had in past years” (Van Dommelen 1965, p. 41).Van Dommelen, David. Walls: Enrichment and Ornamentation. New York: Funk and Wagnalls Company, Inc. 1965. Urban developers often overlook the enriching possibilities of public art. For Bitters architecture should consider the human impact because the environment created by a building affects the people who see and use it. Public sculpture is a way to humanize an urban environment. “You just have to think about people, not just buildings,” he believes.Ruskin, Evey. “Integrating Art Into A Building Shows the Designer Cared.” Anchorage Daily News. July 18, 1981. D6.  Recent resurgence  Stan Bitters thumb pot, 29 X 17 inches. While Bitters’ work has always been commissioned by architects and designers, his work has recently found favor in the vibrant art and design community of Los Angeles, where mid-century modern has once again, as it did throughout the 1950s and 1960s, gained popularity and currency.

Backer joined the Penn State Law faculty in 2000, after having served as professor of law and executive director of the Center for International and Comparative Law of the University of Tulsa College of Law. He has visited at the Tulane Law School (2007–2008) and the University of California, Hastings College of the Law (1998). Professor Backer has lectured and taught on public and private law aspects of globalization in a number of countries in Latin America, Asia and Europe. He founded and sponsors the Penn State Latina/o Law Students Association. In 2006, Backer founded the Coalition for Peace and Ethics, an independent, non-profit, non-partisan, tax-exempt research and information focused organization based in Washington, D.C. As part of its research mission, CPE sponsors research oriented working papers, preliminary scientific or technical paper. The authors of these working papers have released them to share ideas about a topic or to elicit feedback before submitting to a peer reviewed conference or academic journal. These working papers are preliminary versions that are being shared to a broad research community, with the aim of contributing to scholarly debate and soliciting constructive feedback. Backer is also a member of the American Law Institute and the European Corporate Governance Institute. He served as the chair of the Penn State University Faculty Senate for 2012–2013. Scholarship  Constitutionalism  For his work on transnational constitutionalism, Backer has argued that after World War II, transnational constitutionalism embraced universal human rights as the core feature that emerged with the introduction of post-conflict German and Japanese constitutions. He also has examined the emergence of theocratic constitutionalism starting from the Iranian 1979 constitution. Backer argues that constitutionalism is the legal process in which each state harmonizes with international norms and laws. Backer is well known for his works on Chinese constitutionalism. According to Backer, China is evolving towards a \\"single party constitutionalist state\\" that is grounded in its unique form of \\"party-state constitutionalism.\\" Backer argued that the Chinese constitutionalist state differs from the Western model in that the CCP plays a central role in the Chinese constitutional order. In order to articulate his conception of the Chinese \\"single-party constitutionalist state\\" as a new model of constitutionalist governance, Backer delineated the history for the Chinese state-party system that began from Mao Zedong, and was subsequently improved and strengthened through the works of Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Hu Jintao. Backer acknowledged that Mao Zedong Thought has had a profound impact on the shaping of China's constitutionalist system, especially in regard to the idea of the Party's role as an outsider. \\"The CCP was not merely a vanguard party, but for a long time a revolutionary party. Even after the end of the civil war, the CCP continued to think of itself as outside the apparatus.\\" Therefore, in terms of the relationship between the CCP and the state, there was a lengthy process of internalization where the Party as an outsider became internalized into the state through its Mass Line.  Corporate and Transnational Law  Backer has also written extensively on the imposition of binding human rights norms on multinational corporations, where \\"the norms internationalize and adopt an enterprise liability model as the basis for determining the scope of liability for groups of related companies. This approach ... eliminates one of the greatest complaints about globalization through large webs of interconnected but legally independent corporations forming one large enterprise.\\" Backer is also known for his work on the Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs), where he suggested that states have deployed their private global investments (SWFs) as instruments for public global governance.

She served with the Jersey-based Channel Islands flotilla under Commodore Philippe d'Auvergne, Prince of Bouillon. As a lugger she participated in two notable engagements, the second of which won for her crew the Naval General Service Medal, awarded some 50 years later. As a brig, she captured two privateers. HM hired armed lugger Aristocrat On her first contract, Aristocrat served from 2 November 1794 to 9 December 1798. The owner and original master of the vessel was a Mr. Henry Wilkins. She was armed with four 6-pounder and eight 4-pounder guns.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 15, pp.310-4. She was of 172 tons (bm), and Admiralty records later give her armament as twenty-two 4-pounder guns. In 1793, at the beginning of the French Revolutionary Wars, the Governor of Jersey Alexander Lindsay had opened communications between England and the Royalists. Lindsay was then transferred to Jamaica in 1794, and Commodore d'Auvergne picked up where Lindsay left off. d'Auvergne used his vessels, and particularly Aristocrat after she arrived, to support a network of spies, bring French emigres out, and support insurgents by smuggling arms, ammunition, and supplies across the short stretch of water to the French mainland. There exist records in the National Archives of the number of emigres carried on board Aristocrat by d'Auvergne's order over the period 4 March 1795 to 2 September 1797. Wilkins provided the date of embarkation and the passengers' expenses.List of French Emigrants on board HM hired armed lugger Aristocrat and subsisted... - Accessed 14 May 2013. Wilkins and his activities were such an annoyance that the Revolutionary authorities offered a reward of 2,000 livres for his capture. Action of 15 July 1795 It was on one of these extraction trips that Aristocrat had to battle for her survival. On 15 July 1795 she had picked up eight emigres and a Mr. Prejant, most of them agents (spies). Her passengers informed Wilkins that orders had arrived at St Malo for the authorities to send out every armed vessel they could to chase off Aristocrat, or better, to capture her. To avoid the pursuit, Wilkins sailed for the islands of Chozé. Wilkins wanted to anchor there, but the arrival of a French cutter that he had encountered earlier led him to engage. Wilkins gave up his pursuit when the cutter took refuge under the guns of a strong shore battery. As Aristocrat sailed away, she encountered a flotilla of French vessels, with the cutter having come up again, though maintaining a respectful distance. Wilkins's passengers expressed their concern that they would be executed if captured. Wilkins, who also had no desire to be captured, assured them that if capture was imminent, he would blow up Aristocrat, which was carrying 123 barrels of gunpowder for the insurgents, in addition to her regular store. By 10:30am a general engagement had developed, with Aristocrat in the center of a French flotilla that consisted of nine vessels: Société Populaire (ship; 16 x 8-pounder long guns), Diligente (brig; twelve 12-pounder guns), Brave (brig; four 36-pounders), Hirondelle (brig; twelve 6-pounder guns), Furet (brig; twelve 4-pounder guns), Harmonie (brig; four 24-pounder guns), Terreur (cutter; ten 4-pounder guns), Marat (cutter; ten 4-pounder guns), and Furette (lugger; three 24-pounder guns). A running fight continued along the coast, which became lined with spectators watching the engagement, as Aristocrat tacked first one way and then another. Finally, after dark, Aristocrat lost her pursuers. When she reached the Minques rocks south of Jersey, Wilkins anchored, his crew exhausted after some 18 hours of running battle. Aristocrat had suffered no casualties. Commodore d'Auvergne sent a Mr. J. Richardson to Saint Malo under a flag of truce. He reported that Societé Populaire was badly shot up, had had heavy casualties, and had five of her guns dismounted. Diligence had had five men killed and several wounded. Lastly, one of the cutters had been so holed that she had reached port with seven feet of water in her hold. \\"Port Spergui\\" In March, Lieutenant George M'Kinley, of the brig , and Lieutenant Abraham Gossett in Aristocrat had chased a French convoy consisting of a corvette, two luggers, four brigs, and two sloops, which had taken refuge in Spergui Bay (Erquy; also Herqui, Bouche d'Arkie or Bay of Erqui), near Cap Fréhel. Sir William Sidney Smith arrived in his 38-gun frigate , and proceeded to blockade the port while taking soundings. On 18 March 1796 at noon he sailed in, with M'Kinley and Gossett having volunteered to go in too; as they were under Commodore d'Auvergne's command, Smith could not order them to do so. The French had two shore batteries, one of one 24-pounder on one side, and another of two 24-pounders, augmented by a third gun on a higher point, on the other. As the three British warships sailed into the port, they were able quickly to silence the one-gun battery, but the other three guns remained a problem. Smith sent in a landing party under his first lieutenant Horace Pine and Lieutenant Edmund Carter of the Royal Marines. This party faced intense small arms fire from the garrison of the battery, who had descended to the beach. The landing party then scrambled ashore at another point and scaled the precipice, getting to the guns before the men on the beach could regain their position. The landing party spiked the guns and then withdrew, suffering only one casualty, Lieutenant Carter, who was mortally wounded. The British succeeded in setting fire to all but one lugger, which kept up its fire throughout the action. French records report that during the engagement, the commander of the corvette Étourdie, lieutenant de vaisseau Dusaulchoy, was killed. The crew then set fire to the vessel in order to prevent the British from capturing her, and abandoned her.Fonds, Vol. 1, p. 184. (Smith's report credits a boarding party with firing Étourdie). Throughout the action Aristocrat covered the British boats. British casualties totaled two men killed and seven wounded, including lieutenants Pine and Carter, again, the latter mortally.James (1837), Vol. 1, pp.319-20. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Port Spergui\\", to the four surviving claimants from the three ships that had taken part in the attack. Re- fitting Apparently, when Aristocrats contract was over, Wilkins took her into dock for repair. At the government's express stipulation, he had her converted to a brig. HM hired armed brig Aristocrat On her second contract, Aristocrat served from 13 November 1799 until 14 November 1801. Admiralty records describe the brig as being of 161 tons (bm), and carrying eighteen 4-pounder guns. In December 1799, her captain, Lieutenant Corbet James d'Auvergne, Commodore d'Auvergne's half-brother, had urgent business to settle onshore when Commodore d'Auvergne needed to send Aristocrat on a mission. The commodore appointed Lieutenant Nicholas Wray, first lieutenant of , acting captain of Aristocrat. On her way back from the mission on 30 December, she encountered a privateer out of Saint Malo. After a five-hour chase, Aristocrat succeeded in capturing the Avanture (or Aventure), of fourteen 4 and 2-pounder guns, and 42 men. She was ten days out of St Malo but had not yet captured anything. There was a gale that night and the prize's rigging was so shot-up that on 1 January 1800 Wray brought Aristocrat and Avanture into Plymouth rather than Jersey.Lloyd's List №4012. On 19 February 1800, Aristocrat was again under Lieutenant d'Auvergne's command when she fell in with a French gunvessel. After an hour's chase, Gun Vessel No. 57 struck about half a mile from Cap Fréhel. The gun vessel was armed with one iron 24-pounder gun in her bow and had some small arms. She was under the command of Enseigne de vaisseau Cityoyen Rouilland and was 24 hours out from the River Fegué on her way to Saint Malo. Several of her crew and passengers escaped on a boat before she struck, and one man drowned while attempting to escape by swimming. Fate It is not clear what became of Aristocrat after the end of her second contract. Wilkins may have sold her as he later appears as captain of the hired armed schooner Princess Charlotte in 1805-6, and then as master on two subsequent letters of marque.

Licensed to Athol, Massachusetts, United States, it serves the North County and Pioneer Valley areas. The signal for WKMY can be heard in north central Massachusetts, southern New Hampshire, and southern Vermont. It first began broadcasting in 1989 under the call sign WCAT-FM. The station is owned by the Educational Media Foundation. History The station first signed on December 4, 1989 as WCAT-FM, a contemporary hit radio station owned by P&S; Broadcasting along with WCAT (700 AM, now WPVQ). By 1992, the station had shifted to an adult contemporary format, then to hot adult contemporary a year later. In 1998, P&S; sold WCAT-FM and WCAT to CAT Communications Corporation (a company controlled by Jeff Shapiro), who in turn sold the stations to Citadel Broadcasting in 2000. Citadel operated the WCAT stations as part of its Worcester group of stations, even though Arbitron considered the stations to be within the Boston market. That September, WCAT- FM changed to an oldies format; from 2001 until 2002, this was simulcast on the AM sister station. On April 19, 2002, the call letters were changed to WAHL, after Citadel moved the WCAT-FM call sign to a Cat Country-branded station on 106.7 FM in Hershey, Pennsylvania (WCAT-FM is now assigned to 102.3 FM in Carlisle, Pennsylvania). Logo as \\"99.9 The River\\", a simulcast of WXRV Citadel sold WAHL and WCAT to Northeast Broadcasting, controlled by Steve Silberberg, in 2003. That October, the station was renamed WNYN-FM and introduced a classic rock format branded as \\"99.9 The Eagle.\\" In April 2008, the station became WXRG, a simulcast of adult album alternative sister station WXRV in Andover; in late 2011, the simulcast was extended to the AM station, by then WTUB. The call letters were changed to WFNX on May 6, 2013. The WFNX call letters were previously used by an alternative rock station in Boston owned by the Boston Phoenix, first on 101.7 FM (now WBWL) and later as an Internet radio station; after that station shut down along with the Phoenix, Northeast Broadcasting acquired the call sign for 99.9 FM in April 2013. WFNX logo from July 1, 2014 through May 29, 2016. WFNX and what had become WWBZ dropped the WXRV simulcast in May 2014 and began stunting with a wide range of music while preparing to launch new formats for the stations on June 9, with listeners being asked to vote on which of the songs being played should be included in the new formats. On June 9 at 9 a.m., the station launched its permanent variety hits format, asking listeners to now vote for its nickname; the simulcast on WWBZ ended two hours earlier, when that station introduced a separate oldies format. On July 1, WFNX officially began branding as simply \\"99-9 WFNX.\\" In May 2016, the station announced that it would end its variety hits format after May 29 and return to simulcasting WXRV, citing a lack of advertiser support; in its announcement, WFNX said it needed ten businesses to advertise on the station on an annual basis to cover its costs. Northeast Broadcasting agreed to sell WFNX to the Educational Media Foundation for $250,000 in January 2020; EMF already owned WKMY (91.1 FM) in nearby Winchendon, which carried its K-Love network. The sale was one of two EMF acquisitions in Worcester County in early 2020; it announced its purchase of WAAF a month later. The sale was completed on May 4, 2020; on May 19, it took on the WKMY call sign, reflecting the move of K-Love's contemporary Christian programming from 91.1, which became Air1 station WRWX.

Johnson or GPJ is an American multinational corporation that specializes in event marketing and brand marketing, with headquarters located in Auburn Hills, Michigan, United States. GPJ operates primarily as a marketing and advertisement firm, providing digital, multimedia and physical marketing interactions, as well as offering brand management services and consulting, however GPJ specializes in more traditional physical event management. GPJ has a wide variety of clients in various industries: automotive, technology, software, food & beverage, entertainment, including over 40 Fortune 500 Companies. The company was founded in 1914 by its namesake George P. Johnson in Detroit, Michigan as a flag-making and sail-repair establishment. Initially establishing itself as an event management firm in the Detroit area automotive industry, the company's early years were heavily rooted in working with the automobile industry and managing trade shows and events. Expansion of the company took place around the 1990s as GPJ started up offices in Boston, Seattle, Chicago and Brussels, Belgium. This period also saw tremendous growth for the firm, as they began to diversify and internationalize. The company also gained notability with a partnership with IBM.  History   Origins (1910s-1940s)  Founded in 1914, George P. Johnson was established as a flag-maker and sail repairs establishment by its namesake. The company originally involved itself with the Detroit Auto Show, working on the auto industry's annual exhibit of new vehicles, due to Johnson's prior involvement with the event. Throughout the years, Johnson's company began producing banners, flags and buntings for parade floats and special exhibits. With the trade show in Detroit growing to greater prominence the early GPJ had established itself as one of the leading creators.  Formative years (1950s-1980s)  In 1956 GPJ assisted in producing the first International Auto Show in New York. Later in 1961, the firm introduced the spinning turntable for presenting cars, which would later become an industry standard for many such events. This was the company's first venture outside of the Detroit area automotive events. In 1976, Johnson's grandson Robert G. Vallee Jr. began working at the company, and two years later he was assigned as the head of production. In 1980, Vallee after being appointed account executive, was assigned to work with American Honda, one of the first foreign carmakers that the company had worked with. In 1985, office was opened in Los Angeles, and with Vallee's assistance the company had assignments from clients such as Toyota and Nissan. By 1989, the work that the company had been doing in the west coast had secured as second production facility there, along with moves to seek out clients and opportunities outside the automotive industry, and experimented with developing its consulting capabilities.  Emergence (1990-2000s)  In the beginning of the 1990s GPJ expanded with offices in Boston, Chicago and Seattle. This was also brought along with the company winning the account of Chrysler International, leading to the openings of the first European offices in Brussels, Belgium for the firm. By this point GPJ's annual revenues were at $100 million or more, and the company had between 300 and 500 employees, with dependence on seasonal needs. March 1996 saw GPJ's main headquarters and production operation moved to Auburn Hills, Michigan to a larger 300,000-square foot facility. Many other moves followed with the administrative, sales, and design departments relocated to a new 36,000-square foot state-of-the-art paint shop and a 100,000-square foot warehouse space for storing client exhibit pieces. Additionally new offices in San Jose, California were opened to cater to the emergent computer electronics industry and contracts were won with Cisco Systems, Siebel and Intel. In that same year, Robert Vallee, Jr. gained the title of CEO in addition to being the company's president. At this point, GPJ's client list included 40 Fortune 500 companies with 90% of sales deriving from the auto industry still. Creation of high production visual displays for auto shows became a new hallmark for the company, with each custom made and incorporating technologies like simulated- motion and virtual reality. By June 1998, GPJ had been selected to function as IBM's exhibition management services worldwide. 1,000 business shows were added to the company's event schedule with a $40 million assignment. The year also saw the alliance with National Commerce Bank Services in installing itself within locations inside supermarkets and retail stores. In March 1999, GPJ bought a majority stake in Raumtechnik Messebau GmbH in Stuttgart, Germany and later renamed Raumtechnik Messebau & Event Marketing GmbH. Acquisition of the firm added 100 employees with $18 million of annual sales. Two months later the company once again bought stakes in Project Worldwide, a London- based creative communications agency. In the same year, the company also produced the North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) in Detroit with countless of automotive clients utilising rotating turntables, cars, videos, graphics, and other special effects. In September 2001, GPJ acquired Designtroupe, a company from Australia. This acquisition brought the company into the Asian Pacific region opening offices in Sydney, Singapore, Tokyo. In the same year it acquired Conference Planners of Burlingame California, an event management company owned by CEO Chris Meyer. A joint venture in China with Highteam Public Relations Co. Ltd. of Beijing in the fall of 2002, brought the company 110 employees with offices in three cities and access into the developing China region.  Corporate affairs   Notable projects  In recent years, GPJ has participated and organized in larger, more globally significant events and exhibits including major events in China: the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, as well as starting contributing to its other more domestic projects, the Brand X Challenge, amongst its standard trade shows and industry specific events. = 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics = George P. Johnson was engaged with two first-tier Olympic sponsors helping run, design and create the exhibitions in the pavilions which were situated on the Olympic green. The company sought to improve and expand its international image by undertaking one of the biggest known events in the Mainland China region. Robert Albitz, GPJ's Senior Vice President of worldwide creative, said that the question was \\"how to build a compelling experience\\" that would transcend linguistic and cultural gaps. Furthermore, GPJ used Lenovo's technology to its fullest in the latter's exhibition, especially the integration of computerized wrist bands and blue screen technology to create backgrounds for photos, Albitz mentioned that \\"It gives us a chance to show off Lenovo's proprietary Veriface facial-recognition software\\". Likewise was done for the Bank of China exhibits where the firm sought to tell the story of the bank's involvement with the Olympics and its history as well as use the former example of blue screen technology in capturing simulated backgrounds. George P. Johnson played a prominent role in the creation and design of the Lenovo and Bank of China pavilions for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. Utilizing heavily interactive exhibits focused on audience participation, the two pavilions both boast interactive game experiences and work through presentations via storytelling. Lenovo's pavilion in the Olympic green hosted a game to demonstrate Lenovo's active protection systems while The Bank of China's pavilion hosted similar features, having them participate in a virtual stock market game and an interactive sports experience where one can play badminton against a member of China's national team; a Wii-like experience. Both these pavilions had hospitality suites for private interaction. The bank's pavilion was under development for over eight months while the Lenovo exhibit was under more than a year of development with GPJ. GPJ received industry awards and accolades for the design of The Bank of China exhibition; two employees were bestowed top design honors for their contributions to the exhibition. = 2010 Shanghai World Expo = GPJ participated in the creating and designing the Australian and Cisco pavilions for the 2010 World Expo that took place in Shanghai. Having won a public tender and being selected for designing the Australian pavilion, the company was given $3 million to create an exhibit that represented the culture and diversity of Australia. The interactions throughout the exhibit centered on content without narrative due to the Mandarin speaking majority among the expo attendees. The entire exhibit was designed around the usage of interactive visual art, acrobatics, performance art, non-narrative music, film, dance and multimedia elements. George P. Johnson was also awarded an Innovation Award by Cisco, whose pavilion GPJ also worked on. = Brand X Challenge = In 2013, George P. Johnson developed a competition for students to promote the skills and values needed for success in the marketing industry. The Brand X Challenge seeks to promote the industry and get the program or similar activities within college and university syllabuses. In conjunction with EventMarketer and Under Armour, GPJ managed to get 50+ teams of students from across the USA to participate. The competition consisted of designing mock sponsorships campaigns for UA at the 2014 Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia with the various elements and stages of event managing including, pre-event social media interactions to onsite work at the event. Thirty-nine judges from a host of famous top brands served as judges for the competition, these companies/brands include Gatorade, Target, FedEx, Coca Cola Co., IBM etc. A team from a North Carolina university won the event.

It was used in the title of a best-selling 1982 book by Jacques J. Zephire about French feminist Simone de Beauvoir, Le Neo-Feminisme de Simone de Beauvoir (Paris: Denoel/Gonthier 9782282202945). Zephir used the term to differentiate de Beauvoir's views from writers described as \\"Neofeminist\\", such as literary theorist Luce Irigaray, who indicated in her own writing that women had an essentialist femininity that could express itself in écriture féminine (feminine writing/language), among other ways. Céline T. Léon has written, \\"one can only identify the existentialist's [de Beauvoir's] glorification of transcendence with the type of feminism that Luce Irigaray denounces in Ce sexe qui n'en est pas un: \\"Woman simply equal to men would be like them and therefore not women\\".\\" De Beauvoir's views were quite the opposite: Later writers and popular culture commentators appear to have continued this use of the term to describe essentialist feminism. It has been used by sociologists to describe a new popular culture movement that \\"celebrates both the feminine body and women's political achievements\\": Other uses The term has also been equated with the new feminism described by Pope John Paul II. The feminist film scholar Hilary Radner has used the term neofeminism to characterize the iteration of feminism advocated by Hollywood's spate of romantic comedies inaugurated by Pretty Woman (Gary Marshall, 1990) often described as postfeminist. Radner argues that the origins of neofeminism can be traced back to figures such as Helen Gurley Brown writing in the 1960s, meaning that the term postfeminism (suggesting that these ideas emerged after second-wave feminism) is potentially misleading .

HMS Vivien (L33) was a V-class destroyer of the British Royal Navy that saw service in World War I and World War II. Construction and commissioning Vivien, the first Royal Navy ship of the name, was ordered on 30 June 1916 as part of the 9th Order of the 1916-17 Naval Programme. She was laid down in July 1916 by Yarrow Shipbuilders at Scotstoun, Glasgow, Scotland, and launched on 16 February 1918. She was completed on 28 May 1918 and commissioned into service the same day. She was assigned the pennant number G39 in June 1918; this was changed to L33 during the interwar period. Service history World War I All V- and W-class destroyers, Vivien among them, were assigned to the Grand Fleet or Harwich Force. Vivien saw service in the last year of World War I and in 1919 served in the Baltic during the Russian Intervention.

After completing them on 25 October 1939, she steamed to Rosyth to finish her work- ups, and in November 1939 entered service there as an escort for convoys in the North Sea. On 10 April 1940, Vivien was part of the escort of Convoy ON 25, which had departed Rosyth the previous evening bound for Norway, when she detected a possible submarine and depth-charged it; she also assisted that day in driving off attacks by German Heinkel He 111 bombers and investigated the wreckage of an He 111 shot down by Royal Air Force fighters which crashed 1.5 nautical miles (2.75 km) from her.warsailors.com CONVOY ON 25 – U.K.-Norway She did not take part in any of the operations related to the evacuation of Allied personnel from the Netherlands, Belgium, and France in May and June 1940.

She attended Cook and Port Augusta Primary Schools and Port Augusta High School. She married Teofil Stefan Baluch, a Ukrainian who had been imprisoned in Dachau concentration camp in World War II, in 1954.

After becoming mayor in 1981, she led the successful effort to ban drinking in public places in Port Augusta. She also came to public notice when she imposed a night-time curfew on the citizens of the town in order to reduce violence. She stood as the Liberal candidate for Grey at the 1983 Australian federal election. Her husband died 16 years before she did, of lung cancer. As he did not smoke, it was attributed to the power stations where he worked. Baluch campaigned for solar-thermal technology to replace coal-fired power.

Saint Mary's University - News Posts. 2 December 2014. Retrieved: 26 May 2015. On June 1, 1968, he was ordained a priest in the Roman Catholic Church. As professor of physics at Saint Mary's University in Halifax, he specialized in astrophysics and microwave technology. He wrote a high school textbook on radio-physics, which is still used today, and had served for several years as a visiting short-term teacher at Bellarmine College Preparatory in San Jose, California. Fascinated by amateur radio, he soon became an expert in it. In his capacity as a researcher, he was one of the few people to gain access to the environmentally sensitive Sable Island, off the coast of Nova Scotia. He had a sabbatical year in 1990–1991, and spent it in Tucson, Arizona, with the Vatican Observatory team. He was dedicated to reflections on the relationship between science and religion in the modern age. When he achieved Professor Emeritus status in 1995, he was among the last Jesuit professors to retire from the university, which was under Jesuit administration from 1937 to 1970. Since his retirement, he worked assiduously in translating and editing a series of publications pertaining to the Jesuit Missions in Canada, beginning with the mission at Port Royal (today's Nova Scotia) in 1611 and reaching the 1860s. Fr. Lonc's areas of specialization included the early history of the Society of Jesus in the Maritimes, in Quebec and in 19th century Ontario. Most of the material consisted of translations from French and Latin of letters, diaries, and Reports (Relations), including the French historical works by Lucien Campeau, and is therefore basic data for historiographers. In his final years he served as chaplain to the Sisters of St. Joseph in Toronto. He died on November 27, 2014, at the René Goupil House, the Jesuit infirmary in Pickering, Ontario, aged 85 years, having lived 60 years in religious life in the Society of Jesus.

History Ural was born in 1956 into an Arab family in Hatay Province, Turkey. He studied philosophy at Istanbul University. Ural was detained on 10 March 1978 over a bank robbery and was imprisoned at Adana. He escaped through a 150m tunnel in August 1980. After his escape from prison, he fled to Syria where he was granted Syrian citizenship by Jamil al-Assad. In Syria, Ural ran a splinter faction of the People's Liberation Party-Front of Turkey. In 1982 he was arrested in Stuttgart, Germany, and spent time in prison. Ural has led the Popular Front for the Liberation of the Sanjak of Iskenderun, now known as the Syrian Resistance, since 1986. He was detained at the Fleury-Mérogis Prison in France in 1988. Ural was accused of involvement in the Bayda and Baniyas massacres and the Reyhanlı bombings of May 2013, but denied responsibility. In March 2016 the Syrian jihadist group Ahrar al-Sham wrongly claimed to have killed Ural. In late January and early February 2018, Ural attended a Russian-sponsored Syrian peace conference in Sochi, Russia. Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu protested his attendance, saying \\"We want this person’s immediate detention and extradition to Turkey\\". Ural was badly injured on 6 July 2019, after his vehicle struck a roadside bomb while travelling along the Latakia-Slinfah road, following which he was flown by helicopter to a government hospital in Damascus. The bombing happened in the context of the 2019 Northwestern Syria offensive, with Syrian rebel group Abu Amara Special Operations Brigade claiming responsibility for the attack.

Natanzon graduated from the New York State University at Buffalo in 1991 with a degree in accounting. Shortly thereafter he moved to Manhattan.

Natanzon himself played poker and was part owner of a card parlor in Tel Aviv. In 2005 Natanzon played on the Israeli team in the Nations Cup backgammon tournament. In 2007, Natanzon was named the number one backgammon player in the world by an unscientifically compiled peer-audited review known as Giants of Backgammon.

In 1901, James Gallop purchased the Freemasons' Hotel property and commissioned architect Frederick William Burwell to design a new hotel for the site. Burwell also designed the Central Chambers, Victoria Pavilion, Fowler's Warehouse, Owston's Buildings and Marmion House. The construction was undertaken by William Reynolds and was carried out in stages so that the hotel could continue to trade. In the 1920s, a first floor wing was added to the western side of the hotel. In 1955, the veranda and balcony was removed and replaced with a suspended awning. In 1923 the Swan Brewery purchased the hotel from William Padbury, retaining ownership of it until 1977. In April 1984, the Freemasons' Hotel was sold to Brewtech Ltd who undertook a major restoration and upgrading of the hotel, converting it into Australia's first boutique pub brewery, and renaming it the Sail and Anchor in 1986. The renovations included the restoration of the veranda and balcony.

The variation in the degree of fatty acid unsaturation of the yeast indicates its ability to alter the cellular component is fundamental to adaptation to environmental changes. The extent to such ability determines the growth temperature limits of Leucosporidium frigidum. The lower limit is the point at which its membrane lipids solidify and the upper limit is the point at which its membrane lipids melt. Cytochrome concentration Leucosporidium frigidum shows absorption bands at room temperature characteristic of cytochromes aa3, b and c. The concentration to the cytochromes in Leucosporidiaceae frigidum is negatively related to its membrane-lipid unsaturation rate. At the maximum growth temperatures when the degree of lipid unsaturation of the cell membrane is high, the final cell yield is less than at lower temperatures when membrane-lipid unsaturation rate is low. This indicates glucose repression of cytochrome synthesis occurs at high degree of lipid unsaturation. However, a high concentration of cytochrome c is observed at the maximum growth temperatures of Leucosporidium frigidum. This phenomenon may be an attempt by the cells to compensate for the decrease in cytochrome a+a3 by involving alternative pathways of electron transport. Functions of cellular membranes The positive correlation relationship between the growth temperature of Leucosporidiaceae frigidum and the membrane-lipid unsaturation rate, and the negative relationship between the membrane-lipid unsaturation rate and cytochrome concentration in cells indicate the membrane structure and composition are significant to temperature adaptation in Leucosposidiaceae frigidum. Manipulation of the fatty-acid unsaturation index allows Leucosposidiaceae frigidum to alter its membrane fluidity, and function with changing temperatures.

His research focuses on the isolation and structural characterization of natural products, and currently investigates the role of biologically active small molecules in mediating symbiotic interactions and disease. Biography Clardy grew up in Arlington, Virginia, United States, the oldest of four children. He attended Yale University where he received a B.S. in 1964 and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. While he was always captivated by biology, during college he became more interested in chemistry. He performed undergraduate research in organic synthesis, directed by R. Stephen Berry, with an emphasis on benzyne.Berry, R. S., Clardy, J. & Schafer, M. E. Benzyne. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 86, 2738–2739 (1964) After graduating from Yale, he moved to Harvard University, where he received a Ph.D. in chemistry in 1969. He then accepted a faculty position in the Chemistry Department at Iowa State University, where he was affiliated with the Ames Laboratory. In 1978, he moved to the Chemistry Department at Cornell University where he stayed until 2002, when he moved to the Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology Department at Harvard Medical School. In 2004, he started the Ph.D. Program in Chemical Biology with Stuart Schreiber and Greg Verdine. He also created, and continues to teach, a popular class entitled \\"Molecules of Life\\" for Harvard undergraduates who are not majoring in sciences. While pursuing his Ph.D., Clardy met his wife Andrea Fleck, a Swarthmore College graduate, who is a writer. Her works include a children's book, two books about upstate New York, and plays that have been performed across the country. They have two sons. Natural product discovery Clardy's early research focused on the structure elucidation of natural products primarily by X-ray crystallography. Early on at Iowa State University Clardy established important collaborations with Bill Fenical, John Faulkner and Paul Scheuer,The American Society of Pharmacognosy Newsletter. 1-3 (2004) which led to the structure elucidation of numerous marine natural products such as the anticancer agent bryostatin,Pettit, G. R. et al. Isolation and structure of bryostatin 1. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 104, 6846–6848 (1982) the insecticidal and antifungal jaspamide, diazonamide A and B,Lindquist, N., Fenical, W., Van Duyne, G. D. & Clardy, J. Isolation and structure determination of diazonamides A and B, unusual cytotoxic metabolites from the marine ascidian Diazona chinensis. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113, 2303–2304 (1991) and many others. Some of his most notable early work focused on the neurotoxins associated with \\"red tide\\" – which led to the determination of the three dimensional structures of saxitoxin,Schantz, E. J. et al. Structure of saxitoxin. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 97, 1238–1239 (1975) of the gonyautoxin group, and the cyclic polyether brevetoxin B.Lin, Y.-Y. et al. Isolation and structure of brevetoxin B from the' red tide' dinoflagellate Ptychodiscus brevis (Gymnodinium breve). J. Am. Chem. Soc. 103, 6773–6775 (1981) Upon moving to Cornell University, Clardy's research expanded to include a huge variety of non-marine organisms including, but not limited to, fungi, Actinobacteria and C. elegans. His longstanding interest in endophytic fungi led to the discovery of the selectively cytotoxic quinone torreyanic acid, the structurally diverse guanacastepenes, the antimycotic agent cryptocin, and many others. Recently, Clardy has focused on symbiotic associations between bacteria and other organisms as rich sources of novel small molecules. In collaboration with Cameron Currie, Clardy investigated associations between Actinomycetes and insects such as the southern pine beetle, ants and termites that led to the discovery of antifungal agents including dentigerumycinOh, D.-C., Poulsen, M., Currie, C.

Beetle Bacteria Wield An Antifungal Agent. Chemical & Engineering News 86, 47 (2008) The study of chemical exchange in complex ecological interactions remains a central focus of the Clardy lab. X-ray crystallography of small molecule – protein interactions Clardy, in collaboration with Stuart Schreiber and colleagues, obtained the crystal structure for both the FK506/FKBP12 and rapamycin/FKBP12 complexes.Van Duyne, G.D., Standaert, R. F., Karplus, P. A., Schreiber. S.L., Clardy J. Atomic structure of FKBP-FK506, an immunophilin-immunosuppressant complex. Science 252, 839-842 (1991) Shortly thereafter Schreiber and Clardy went on to determine the structure of the FK506/rapamycin/FRAP complex – a groundbreaking study that revealed the ability of a cell-permeable small molecule to facilitate protein dimerization.Choi, J., Chen, J., Schreiber S. L., Clardy J. Structure of the FKBP12-rapamycin complex interacting with the binding domain of human FRAP. Science 273, 239-242 (1996) Vertex, a start-up pharmaceutical company, was founded to design a nontoxic version of FK506.Billion Dollar Molecule: The Quest for the Perfect Drug, Barry Werth, 1994 In collaboration with Walter Leal, Clardy and colleagues obtained an X-ray crystal structure for the volatile insect pheromone bombykol with its binding partner located on the antennae of female silkworm moths.Sandler, B. H., Nikonova, L., Leal, W. S. & Clardy, J. Sexual attraction in the silkworm moth: structure of the pheromone-binding-protein-bombykol complex. Chemistry & Biology 7, 143–151 (2000) Besides further enhancing the understanding of this highly specific small-molecule-protein interaction, this study marked the first three- dimensional structure of an odorant-binding protein.Sandler, B.

Chemistry & Biology 7, 143–151 (2000) eDNA Clardy is also known for his work in elucidating natural products made by unculturable bacteria and is credited, along with Jo Handelsman and Robert M. Goodman, for pioneering the field of metagenomics. With Sean Brady, he developed a method to insert DNA directly from environmental DNA (eDNA) like soil, into cosmid libraries, search for biosynthetic gene clusters and identify the products of these genes.Brady, S. F., Chao, C. J. & Clardy, J. New Natural Product Families from an Environmental DNA (eDNA) Gene Cluster. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 124, 9968–9969 (2002) Using this method they elucidated the structures of numerous antibiotics previously unattainable by traditional lab techniques, such as natural products derived from long-chain N-acyltyrosines.Brady, S.

The band was formed in 2004 by guitarists Jeff Westlake and Jeff Boggs and vocalist Julie Westlake. Achieving success with their second album Bombshell, they have released 6 full-length albums. History The band formed in 2003, founded by guitarists Jeff Westlake and Jeff Boggs and country vocalist Julie Westlake.A brief history of Hydrogyn In 2004, the band released its self produced debut album Best Served with Volume.Hydrogyn: Band history The album attracted the attention of Pepsi, which endorsed the band and had them perform at NASCAR's Chevy Rocking 400 in May 2005. The popularity of the band further grew with the release of a professional video for The Sand, which was put in rotation in several music channels. In spring 2005, they were contacted by metal producer Michael Wagener, who was impressed by the band and agreed to produce their next album. Released in September 2006, Bombshell entered three Billboard charts (\\"Top Heatseeker Northeast\\", \\"Top Internet Albums\\" and \\"Top Heatseeker\\") and sold over 8000 copies in Europe. Vocalist Westlake featured on several European music magazines, including Fireworks, Strutter, and Flash. The Bombshell tour (which spanned both Europe and the United States) was showcased in the first live release of the band, Strip'em Blind Live, released in July 2007. In 2008 founder guitarist Boggs left the band. That same year a third studio album, Deadly Passions, was released. Jeff Young from Megadeth was briefly considered as a new guitarist, but was eventually turned down. All contributions by Young to the upcoming new album were dismissed and Boggs himself was asked to replay his guitar parts.Interview with Julie Westlake Judgement, released in 2010, was another success, charting at #10 in Billboard's Top Heat Seeker. Another hiatus followed due to Julie Westlake's health problems, which lasted until mid 2011. Upon her return, the band recorded the new album Private Sessions, released in 2012.

August 24, 927?Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276.Academia Sinica Chinese-Western Calendar Converter.August 24, 927 was the date that the Later Tang emperor Li Siyuan issued the edict ordering Doulu's death; it was not clear whether the order was carried out the same day or later.) was an official of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms state Later Tang (and, briefly, Later Tang's predecessor state Jin), serving as a chancellor during the reigns of Later Tang's first two emperors Li Cunxu and Li Siyuan. As a chancellor commissioned by Li Cunxu, he did not fit in with the officials trusted by Li Siyuan, and was eventually exiled and forced to commit suicide.  Background and service under Wang Chuzhi  It is not known where or when Doulu Ge was born. His family was from a prominent aristocratic line,New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 28. but all that was recorded in historical accounts about his immediate ancestors were that both his grandfather Doulu Ji () and father Doulu Zan () served as prefectural prefects —Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 67. although the biography of the Tang chancellor Doulu Zhuan indicated that Doulu Zan was a younger brother of Doulu Zhuan's and thus Doulu Ge was a nephew to Doulu Zhuan.Old Book of Tang, vol. 177. In Doulu Ge's youth, due to the late-Tang Dynasty disturbances, he took refuge, successively, at Fu Prefecture (鄜州, in modern Yan'an, Shaanxi) and Yan Prefecture (延州, also in modern Yan'an), before ending up in Zhongshan (中山, in modern Baoding, Hebei). Wang Chuzhi, who was then the military governor of Yiwu Circuit (義武, headquartered at Zhongshan), treated him with respect and invited him to serve on staff, and it was said that he was good at writing and bookkeeping. Once, when at Wang's request, Doulu wrote an elegant poem about mulberry trees, and thereafter became more respected and promoted to be an assistant to Wang. However, it was said that he did not have upright behavior; for example, on one occasion, when he requested meeting Wang alone, Wang thought that Doulu had important suggestions to correct his governance, and came out of the mansion to personally welcome Doulu in. Instead, Doulu only had requests for military commissions for people he favored.  Service under Li Cunxu  The historical records do not clearly indicate whether Doulu Ge continued to serve on staff of Wang's adoptive son Wang Du after Wang Du seized the circuit from Wang Chuzhi in 921.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 271. However, he was still described as assistant to the military governor of Yiwu as of 923, suggesting that he did. That year, Li Cunxu the Prince of Jin, to whom Wang Du was a vassal, was preparing to declare himself emperor of a new Later Tang, and was trying to find officials from Tang aristocratic families that he could make chancellors. He initially wanted to make an assistant to himself, Lu Zhi (), chancellor, but Lu declined, recommending Doulu and Lu Cheng instead. Li thus summoned Doulu and Lu Cheng to his provisional imperial government and made them chancellors of the provisional government.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. In summer 923, Li formally declared himself emperor of Later Tang at Xingtang (興唐, in modern Handan, Hebei). He gave both Doulu and Lu Cheng designations as Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), making them chancellors, and Doulu was also given the post of Menxia Shilang (門下侍郎, deputy head of the examination bureau of government (門下省, Menxia Sheng). It was said that both he and Lu Cheng were frivolous and lacked talent to serve as chancellors, but Li commissioned them on account of their aristocratic backgrounds and (in Lu's case) having long served on his staff. (Lu was removed later that year, leaving Doulu as the sole chancellor at that time.) Subsequently, as Li was about to launch a surprise attack on archrival Later Liang's capital Daliang, he left Doulu, Li Shaohong, Zhang Xian (), and Wang Zhengyan () in charge of defending Xingtang. After the attack was successful (causing Later Liang's emperor Zhu Zhen to commit suicide as the Later Tang forces approached, ending Later Liang), Li, after he entered Daliang and took over the Later Liang governmental structure, summoned Doulu to him to continue to serve as chancellor. It was said, though, that the actual governmental authorities were in the hands of Li's chief of staff Guo Chongtao (who was also given a chancellor designation), leaving Doulu with little to do. Further, it was said that in drafting regulations on governmental structure, Doulu, due to his lack of talent, was making many mistakes, requiring corrections by his subordinate Xiao Xifu (). Later, Guo recommended Zhao Guangyin to also be chancellor, and Doulu recommended Wei Shuo to also be chancellor, so Li made both Zhao and Wei chancellors as well. Doulu himself was also given the post of director of salt and iron monopolies, as well as acting director of material pricing. He resigned the director of material pricing responsibilities in 924, after he was discovered by his deputy Kong Qian, who coveted the post, of an improper expenditure, as Kong then revealed it to Guo, who in turn informed him of the discovery. (Kong's design on the position was, for the time being, fruitless, however, as Guo recommended Zhang for the post instead, although, then, as Kong's urging, Doulu recommended Wang instead.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 273. Meanwhile, both Doulu and Wei developed poor reputations as chancellors, as Wei was said to be frivolous, and the people blamed Doulu for recommending him. Further, both Doulu and Wei commissioned their sons Doulu Sheng () and Wei Tao () respectively, as governmental advisors serving below them, which was considered improper — and after this was exposed, they removed their sons from those posts but each other's sons to serve as imperial scholars in the imperial institutes that they oversaw — Doulu Ge was overseeing Hongwen Pavilion () and Wei was overseeing Jianxian Institute (), respectively, further hurting their reputation, as this was considered an improper exchange of favors. Further, Doulu was said to be not interested in finding talented people to serve in the imperial administration, but spending his time on alchemy, seeking to extend his life. On one occasion, after he took some allegedly life-extending medications, he vomited blood for several days and nearly died before recovering. Trying to ingratiate Guo, he intimated to Guo that Guo might be a descendant of the great Tang general Guo Ziyi, leading Guo to arrogantly assert so from that point on.  Service under Li Siyuan  In 926, Li Cunxu was killed in a mutiny at then-capital Luoyang. His adoptive brother Li Siyuan, who had previously rebelled against him, quickly arrived at Luoyang and took control of the city. Doulu Ge led the imperial officials in offering the throne to him, which Li Siyuan initially declined, but eventually accepted. Doulu and Wei Shuo were initially retained as chancellors, although Li Siyuan also commissioned Zheng Jue and Ren Huan as chancellors, and the leading figure at court was Li Siyuan's chief of staff An Chonghui.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. Doulu was subsequently put in charge of the building of Li Cunxu's imperial tomb. Doulu's and Wei's downfall, however, would come shortly after that. Doulu, after completing Li Cunxu's tomb, returned to his mansion and waited for the next assignment, as was traditional at the time for a director of an imperial tomb, and he expected to be removed from his chancellor position but made a circuit military governor. After several days, however, the next imperial commission did not come, and at the urging of his family members and friends, he went to the imperial court, implicitly pressing the issue. This offended An, who publicly humiliated Doulu by stating, \\"Your title of director of the imperial tomb is still present, but you do not wait for the new assignment before coming to the imperial court. Is it that you believe that we, as people from a border region, can easily be deceived?\\" (Both Li Siyuan and An were non-Han Chinese.) Doulu and Wei were also being perceived poorly publicly for several different reasons — they were considered to be disrespectful to the emperor while reporting to him; while other imperial officials at that time were taking a reduced amount of their salaries, Doulu and his sons were receiving full pay; and while the other imperial officials backpay were being calculated from the day of Li Siyuan's ascension, Doulu and Wei were still calculating their own from during the time of Li Cunxu's reign. Meanwhile, Xiao Xifu had long resented Doulu and Wei for having rejected his earlier proposed promotion to Jianyi Daifu (), and therefore decided to take vengeance. He submitted a petition in which he not only accused Doulu and Wei of flattery and faithlessness to Li Cunxu, but further falsely accused Doulu of seizing people's farms and allowing his farmer tenants to kill others, and Wei of seizing a neighbor's well in order to steal the treasures that the neighbor's ancestors had hidden in the well. Upon receiving Xiao's petition, Li Siyuan exiled Doulu and Wei — in Doulu's case, to be the prefect of Chen Prefecture (辰州, in modern Huaihua, Hunan), then as census officer of Fei Prefecture (費州, in modern Tongren, Guizhou), and then completely stripped of official positions and exiled to Ling Prefecture (陵州, in modern Meishan, Sichuan). In 927, during the Later Tang imperial government's campaign against the rebel warlord Gao Jixing (whose domain would become the de facto independent state of Jingnan), Li Siyuan issued an edict blaming Wei (who was friendly with Gao) and Doulu of, at the time that Li Cunxu conquered Former Shu in 925, allowing Gao to absorb three prefectures previously belonging to Former Shu into his territory, and he ordered them to commit suicide. Their family members were exiled.  References  * Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 67. * New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 28. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 272, 273, 274, 275, 276.

In the episode, the Griffins join a country club, after Chris begins dating the daughter of Rhode Island's richest family, and Peter ends up getting Lois's father, Carter, thrown out of his beloved country club. Plot While searching for the remote, Stewie finds his harmonica then accidentally leaves it in the bathtub. Peter accidentally sits on it causing it to get stuck in his rectum. Since it is too expensive to remove, Peter decides to make the most of the situation by performing tunes and annoying the family. He makes an appearance on America's Got Talent, and while performing the theme to Sanford and Son he does well until it is dislodged by flatulence. Returning home, Chris hits it off with a girl named Amanda and scores an invitation for the family to the Barrington Country Club as she is a member of the Barrington family. At the club, Carter is annoyed to find Peter there and tries to kick him out until he finds they are there at the invitation of the Barrington family. Carter tries to use the opportunity to get closer to the Barringtons but only annoys them, acting towards Mr. Barrington in the manner of Chester towards Spike in the Looney Tunes cartoon Tree for Two (\\"You and me is pals, ain't we?\\"), and finally getting kicked out of the club after \\"wasting fruit\\" doing the Carmen Miranda dance. Peter gets to take his place. Peter invites Carter as his guest so he can laugh about him with the other members and play pranks on him. Later, Carter comes by crying that he cannot live without the country club and blames Peter for getting him kicked out. Lois extracts an apology from her father and gets Peter to put in a good word for him. Peter tries but is rejected and quits when they cannot both be members. Peter apologizes and Chris reveals that he was also cut off from Amanda. Using Brian's advice, Peter decides to make Carter bigger than Barrington so that he has to look up to him. Arriving in a helicopter, carrying a ship, carrying a limo, with a helicopter inside, they pass themselves off in fancy uniforms as Viscount James Earl Tennisracquet and the Duke of LaCrosseteam on business with Carter. Mr. Barrington invites them into the Barrington Room and is ready to give them another chance until Peter blows their cover, angering Carter. Carter then makes Peter sing jump-rope songs about vegetables until he cries. The abuse of Peter wins Carter a second chance in the club while Peter is thrown out by Carter and Mr. Barrington as the real Viscount James Earl Tennisracquet and the Duke of LaCrosseteam have arrived only to be told of their previous arrival. Back home, Peter is happy to be himself. As a way to end the season, Lois asks him for money for a haircut, but claims that it's too expensive and ruins it by cutting it himself. Reception The episode was met with mixed reviews from critics. The episode received a 2.5 rating in the 18-49 demographic and was watched by a total of 5.16 million viewers. This made it the most watched show on Fox's Animation Domination line-up that night, beating two episodes of The Cleveland Show and two episodes of The Simpsons. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+, saying \\"This episode took a lot longer to get to its main plot without as many laughs along the way.\\" Carter Dotson of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 1.5 out of 5, saying \\"Perhaps the only really interesting thing about it was that we got to see a different side of Carter Pewterschmidt, a sniveling side that wants to suck up to the bigger, richer man. Yet, there's always been an undercurrent of pathetic-ness with him, so it really wasn't revealing all that much.\\" Mark Trammell of TV Equals gave the episode a mixed review, saying \\"So, not the greatest show to go out on, to be sure, but it was okay, I guess. I laughed here and there, but the main plot-lines were pretty predictable and the Chris one in particular didn’t really go anywhere.\\" References * 50px The plot description was adapted from No Country Club for Old Men at Family Guy Wiki, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license.

Its main goal was to associate immigrant workers and integrate them to the labor movement through amnesty.  Origins  The California Immigrant Workers Association was a program by the AFL-CIO in Los Angeles, California intended to help Latino workers to obtain amnesty through the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA).It was founded in that same year by twenty-one unions affiliated to the AFL-CIO and six central labor councils. They had Jose de Paz, a well-known activist, as the Executive Director. The program required a special membership called \\"associate membership\\" which was automatically obtained by simply joining the California Immigrant Workers Association. Even though the program was for immigrant workers, it was mainly targeted towards those workers who had been residing for a long time in the United States and not for workers who had recently arrived into the country. Despite the fact that the association was affiliated with the AFL-CIO, it did not have the power of a union. Nevertheless, its members were people with experience organizing Latinos. They spoke the same language, understood the culture and knew immigration law and the problems of the labor movement.  Latino immigrant workers prior to 1986  Prior to World War I, the AFL often ignored Latinos and focused its attention into more organized groups such as Asian workers and Latino workers did not get sufficient support from the AFL. In fact, the AFL and its leader Samuel Gompers supported immigration restrictions in the basis of economic takeover. According to him, Latinos, especially Mexicans would take the jobs of the white workers and therefore would lower the wages. It was not until restrictions on immigration for Mexicans by the Exclusion Law of 1921 and the Quota Act of 1924 were exempted, that the AFL made arrangements to allow Mexican workers to join American Labor Unions. However, immigrant workers in California still faced discrimination by the AFL, which lobbied to give jobs to white workers over Latino workers, especially during the Great Depression up until the ratification of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which prohibited union discrimination. Nevertheless, even though the AFL opposed immigration it favored amnesty because it believed that legal workers were less likely to be exploited than illegal workers and therefore wages would not drop.  Goals and contributions  The California Immigrant Workers Association became important for the California immigrant workers because it was an attempt to organize those promoting labor rights. It was designed to improve the lives of its members with attorney consultation about issues at the work place, immigration, education, housing, as well as with the opportunity of obtaining knowledge using computers at learning centers. The program thus offered immigrant workers access to health care, provided legal services, and protected union rights that would have not been accessible to Latino immigrant workers without the California Immigrant Workers Association. The association's creation promoted a closer connection between Latino immigrant workers and the AFL-CIO and it became a bridge between Latinos and the labor movement. It was also key organization to win unionization in important strikes such as the wildcat strike in 1991 and the Drywall strike in 1992.

It is part of the Harleian Collection at the British Library. Description Original 2nd-century versions of Geographia typically did not survive to the High Middle Ages; early Renaissance cartographers were working from copies of copies. Examination of the codex indicates the scribe of Harley MS 3686 was transcribing from an all-Latin copy. This codex is based on one of the few reprints that included the map sheets. Many other codices merely copied Book 1, which was text-only. Other scholarly sources indicate that it is near impossible to accurately create the maps from purely the text Ptolemy wrote describing how to produce the maps. Geographically-focused codices with maps often garner broad interest while those codices without maps typically only interest historians of mathematics and cartography. Despite this supposed broad appeal, very little else is easily available about MS 3686. The codex currently resides in the British Library but there have been very few scholarly examinations of it. Even the most well-known surveys of Ptolemaic mapping, Nordenskiöld's Facsimile Atlas and Jesuit Priest Joseph Fisher's Claudii Ptolemaei Geographiae Codex Urbinas Graecus, do not include MS 3686. Although lacking in a printing press or knowledge of the Western Hemisphere, the early 15th-century Europe had an economy providing navigational charts to mariners and scholarly reading material to persons with disposable income (but neither was in the vernacular language). Scribe The scribe of Harley MS 3686 was likely a mapmaker (based on the quality of the freehand drawings and the obvious spelling errors indicative of someone who did not thoroughly understand Latin). The scribe likely drew from other classical and contemporary cartographic references, such as the writings of Pliny and another Ptolemaic codex written by Andrea Bianco in 1436. Scholars of Ptolemy's work in Florence were humanists; neither scholars in Genoa nor Naples used the same cartographic systems displayed in the codex. These facts and the close parallels to Venetian Andrea Bianco's work determine this unknown cartographer was also from Venice. The unknown Italian cartographer that created the MS 3686 codex did add some improvements to his maps beyond making an exact replica of the copy from which he drew. This practice follows the broad rediscovery in Europe of classical knowledge and its use as the foundation of contemporary study. The cartographer cross-referenced Ancient Latin place names for areas around the Mediterranean and Western Europe with contemporary equivalents. The author also provided place names to areas unknown in Ptolemy's era (such as areas around the Caspian Sea in Central Asia). Because of the author's apparent cartographic training, he redrew some of the maps to better conform to contemporary map-making practices. This codex improves on Ptolemy's equi-rectangular and orthographic projections but was written before the publication of the new Mercator projection; re-creating and improving Ptolemy's regional maps without attempting to create a world map. This codex displays depictions of Europe, North Africa, and the Levant superior to other contemporary codices such as the 1459 Mappa Mundi written by Venetian monk Mauro or the 1481 Wilczek-Brown Codex, both of which re-invent Geographia. Provenance How this codex made its way from Venice to England is unclear but was probably due to the Mediterranean Sea-North Sea maritime trade of the 15th and 16th centuries. Robert Burscough owned the manuscript some time prior to his death. MS 3686 was sold by Burscough's widow in May 1715 to Robert Harley when it became part of his Harley's private collection. The collection in total passed through various members of the Harley family before being sold to the British Government by Margaret Bentinck, Duchess of Portland in 1753.

A mode of action should not be confused with mechanism of action, which refer to the biochemical processes underlying a given mode of action. Modes of toxic action are important, widely used tools in ecotoxicology and aquatic toxicology because they classify toxicants or pollutants according to their type of toxic action. There are two major types of modes of toxic action: non-specific acting toxicants and specific acting toxicants. Non-specific acting toxicants are those that produce narcosis, while specific acting toxicants are those that are non-narcotic and that produce a specific action at a specific target site.  Types   Non-specific  Non-specific acting modes of toxic action result in narcosis; therefore, narcosis is a mode of toxic action. Narcosis is defined as a generalized depression in biological activity due to the presence of toxicant molecules in the organism. The target site and mechanism of toxic action through which narcosis affects organisms are still unclear, but there are hypotheses that support that it occurs through alterations in the cell membranes at specific sites of the membranes, such as the lipid layers or the proteins bound to the membranes. Even though continuous exposure to a narcotic toxicant can produce death, if the exposure to the toxicant is stopped, narcosis can be reversible.  Specific  Toxicants that at low concentrations modify or inhibit some biological process by binding at a specific site or molecule have a specific acting mode of toxic action. However, at high enough concentrations, toxicants with specific acting modes of toxic actions can produce narcosis that may or may not be reversible. Nevertheless, the specific action of the toxicant is always shown first because it requires lower concentrations. There are several specific acting modes of toxic action: *Uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation. Involves toxicants that uncouple the two processes that occur in oxidative phosphorylation: electron transfer and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. * Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors. AChE is an enzyme associated with nerve synapses that it’s designed to regulate nerve impulses by breaking down the neurotransmitter Acetylcholine (ACh). When toxicants bind to AChE, they inhibit the breakdown of ACh. This results in continued nerve impulses across the synapses, which eventually cause nerve system damage. Examples of AChE inhibitors are organophosphates and carbamates, which are components found in pesticides (see Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors). * Irritants. These are chemicals that cause an inflammatory effect on living tissue by chemical action at the site of contact. The resulting effect of irritants is an increase in the volume of cells due to a change in size (hypertrophy) or an increase in the number of cells (hyperplasia). Examples of irritants are benzaldehyde, acrolein, zinc sulphate and chlorine. * Central nervous system (CNS) seizure agents. CNS seizure agents inhibit cellular signaling by acting as receptor antagonists. They result in the inhibition of biological responses. Examples of CNS seizure agents are organochlorine pesticides. * Respiratory blockers. These are toxicants that affect respiration by interfering with the electron transport chain in the mitochondria. Examples of respiratory blockers are rotenone and cyanide.  Determination  The pioneer work of identifying the major categories of modes of toxic action (see description above) was conducted by investigators from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at the Duluth Laboratory using fish, reason why they named the categories as Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS). They proposed the FATS by assessing the behavioral and physiological responses of the fish when subjected to toxicity tests, such as locomotive activities, body color, ventilation patterns, cough rate, heart rate, and others. It has been proposed that modes of toxic action could be estimated by developing a data set of critical body residues (CBR). The CBR is the whole- body concentration of a chemical that is associated with a given adverse biological response and it is estimated using a partition coefficient and a bioconcentration factor. The whole-body residues are reasonable first approximations of the amount of chemical present at the toxic action site(s). Because different modes of toxic action generally appear to be associated with different ranges of body residues, modes of toxic action can then be separated into categories. However, it is unlikely that every chemical has the same mode of toxic action in every organism, so this variability should be considered. The effects of mixture toxicity should be considered as well, even though mixture toxicity it's generally additive, chemicals with more than one mode of toxic action may contribute to toxicity. Modeling has become a common used tool to predict modes of toxic action in the last decade. The models are based in Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSARs), which are mathematical models that relate the biological activity of molecules to their chemical structures and corresponding chemical and physicochemical properties. QSARs can then predict modes of toxic action of unknown compounds by comparing its characteristic toxicity profile and chemical structure to reference compounds with known toxicity profiles and chemical structures. Russom and colleagues were one of the first group of researchers being able to classify modes of toxic action with the use of QSARs; they classified 600 chemicals as narcotics. Even though QSARs are a useful tool for predicting modes of toxic action, chemicals having multiple modes of toxic action can obscure QSAR analyses. Therefore, these models are continuously being developed.  Applications   Environmental risk assessment  The objective of environmental risk assessment is to protect the environment from adverse effects. Researchers are further developing QSAR models with the ultimate goal providing a clear insight about a mode of toxic action, but also about what the actual target site is, the concentration of the chemical at this target site, and the interaction occurring at the target site, as well as to predict the modes of toxic action in mixtures. Information on the mode of toxic action is crucial not only in understanding joint toxic effects and potential interactions between chemicals in mixtures, but also for developing assays for the evaluation of complex mixtures in the field.  Regulation  The combination of behavioral and physiological responses, CBR estimates, and chemical fate and bioaccumulation QSAR models can be a powerful regulatory tool to address pollution and toxicity in areas where effluents are discharged.

An F-18 Hornet piloted by Spitfire assists Red in taking the monster down. Red, however, is arrested for disobeying a direct order. He is locked in solitary confinement until he is briefly released by Adm. Hadley and later given a medal of honor for his heroic actions, before serving the rest of his confinement. Later, Adm. Hadley is informed by Sheldon Geise of a top-secret sonar program that discovered the monsters, which are hundreds of millions of years old and lay their eggs on a mixture of crude oil and saltwater. Two eggs have been discovered, one of which hatched into the monster that Red and Spitfire killed. Adm. Hadley orders a search for the other egg, but he is too late, as it has already hatched, with the second monster, much bigger than the first, feeding on the corpse of the first monster and destroying a whole naval fleet before wreaking havoc on the city. As the monster attacks the naval base, Tracy and Jim scramble to spring Red out of solitary before they are picked up by Lt. Wexler. Meanwhile, Geise informs Adm. Hadley that the President has authorized a nuclear strike on the monster, but Adm. Hadley defies that decision and orders everyone to evacuate the base. The monster retreats after a Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit drops a payload on it. Adm. Hadley is later informed that another egg has hatched off the Atlantic Coast. Dr. Adams gives the trio special \\"halo\\" headbands that neurally link them to their robots, increasing their reflexes by using their direct body movements instead of joysticks. The system's downside is the pilot feeling pain for every damage the robot takes. After a crash course on the new system, the trio fly their robots to New York City to battle the monster. Following numerous refusals by Adm. Hadley to launch a nuclear strike, Geise orders the USS Virginia to launch a warhead. Red intercepts the missile and jams its frequency, saving the city from a nuclear holocaust. In retaliation, Geise threatens to shut down the robots, but is quickly subdued by Lt. Wexler, despite shooting the Admiral in the arm. During the battle, Tracy loses consciousness when her neural level goes critical. Jim takes Tracy to safety while Red grabs the warhead and the monster before flying them to the atmosphere. He then kicks the monster to deep space, detonating the warhead in the process and sending him crashing back to Earth. The trio and Adm. Hadley celebrate by heading to the local bar for some tequila shots.

As a result, the production team relocated to a private helicopter airport that served as a stand-in for at least seven locations for the film. The film's script underwent at least nine rewrites during production due to weather conditions and the last-minute relocation. Reception Dave Pace of Fangoria gave the film two out of four stars, calling it \\"a testament to why there aren't many live action giant robot vs. monster movies. It's a very difficult thing to do right and keep the audience on your side. ATLANTIC RIM manages to be enjoyable as a bit of a goof and works on the 'so bad it's good' level.\\" Dread Central gave the film three out of five stars, describing it as \\"the ultimate monster movie about booze-hounding broskis in battle bots saving New York City from a crazy-eyed giant sea beast that frequently appears to be merely a lost animal, confused and irritated that these metal men won't stop hitting it.\\" Appearance on MST3K It is one of six films featured in Season 12 of Mystery Science Theater 3000, and is the only 21st century film riffed on the show.

Gujarati theatre is produced mainly in Gujarat and Maharashtra, in cities like Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Baroda, surat and else where Gujarati diaspora exists, especially North America. Rustam Sohrab, performed by Parsee Natak Mandali on 29 October 1853 in Mumbai, marked the beginning of Gujarati theatre. History Statue of Dalpatram who wrote first Gujarati play, Laxmi in 1850. Dalpatram Chok, Ahmedabad.The region of Gujarat has a long tradition of folk-theatre, Bhavai, which originated in the 14th-century. Thereafter, in early 16th century, a new element was introduced by Portuguese missionaries, who performed Yesu Mashiha Ka Tamasha, based on the life of Jesus Christ, using the Tamasha folk tradition of Maharashtra, which they imbibed during their work in Goa or Maharashtra. Sanskrit drama was performed in royal courts and temples of Gujarat, it did not influence the local theatre tradition for the masses. During British Raj, British officials invited foreign operas and theatre groups to entertain them, this in turn inspired local Parsis to start their own travelling theatre groups, largely performed in Gujarati. The first play published in Gujarati was Laxmi Natak by Dalpatram in 1850, it was inspired by ancient Greek comedy Plutus by Aristophanes. In the year 1852, a Parsi theatre group performed a Shakespearean play in Gujarati language in the city of Surat. In 1853, Parsee Natak Mandali the first theatre group of Gujarati theatre was founded by Framjee Gustadjee Dalal, which staged the first Parsi-Gujarati play, Rustam Sohrab based on the tale of Rostam and Sohrab part of the 10th-century Persian epic Shahnameh by Ferdowsi on 29 October 1853, at the Grant Road Theatre in Mumbai, this marked the begin of Gujarati theatre. The group also performed a farce Dhanji Gharak at the same venue. In its early days, Gujarati theatre largely adopted the entertainment-led style and themes of Parsi theatre, and the plays which were presented in a mix of Gujarati with Urdu and English languages.Chambers, p.381 From being performed without a stage as in the case of Bhavai, raised platforms were added, then backgrounds, which gradually led to the proscenium theatre. Dalpatram formed a theatre group to reform the vulgar element in the bhavai performance of the time, and also the faulty Gujarati language used by Parsi theatre across Mumbai theatre circuit.Mukherjee, p. 322 Bapulal Nayak and Jaishankar Sundari in Mulshankar Mulani's popular play Saubhagya Sundari (1901) Gradually as the numbers of plays being written and performed in Gujarati increased things changed, and finally a theatre group to steer away from the tradition of Parsi theatre and the Bhavai and incorporated elements of Indian and Western dramaturgy was Arya Subodh Natak Mandali was formed in 1878, in Morbi by Mulji and Vaghji Oza, and their first production, Bharthari continued to be staged in Gujarat and Saurashtra region for many years. In the 1880s, as many as seven theatre groups came up, including Deshi Natak Samaj started by Dahyabhai Dholashaji, which lasted from 1889 to 1980. Gujarati Natak Mandali (1878–89) and its successor Mumbai Gujarati Natak Mandali (1889-1948) were pioneer Gujarati theatre companies. In late 19th-century, theatre gained strength and travelling theatre companies became popular, performing plays based on a limited repertoire of mythological and religious plays. On the other hand, commercial theatre stuck to entertainment-oriented comedies, which delayed the arrival of experimental amateur theatre movement. That happened only in the 1920s and 1930s, with the rise of playwrights like C. C. Mehta (1901-1991), who wrote plays with a social context and Ranchhodlal Udayaram Dave (1837- 1923), playwright and producer. They are regarded as the father of modern Gujarati theatre.Datta, p. 1071Natarajan, p. 111 Mehta's most important play, Aag Garhi (Fire Engine), about an ailing fireman, marked the rise of amateur theatre movement in Gujarati theatre.Hochman, p. 37Chambers, p.382Tevani, p. 50 Mehta went to write over 25 plays, numerous one act plays and radio plays; then in 1970, he himself translated his most known work, Aag Garhi as Iron Road.George, p. 179 Sarjanhar was another important play of the period, inspired by Gandhian ideologies, it dealt with untouchability and was staged by popular actors of the time Sukhlal and Harilal. Advertisement of Sneh Sarita, a 1915 play By the 1920s, theatre had become an integral part of the festive calendar. Elaborate sets and costumes became the high point of the period, and important actors of the era were Bapulal Nayak and Jaishankar Bhojak 'Sundari' (1889-1975), who worked both in old-style as well as the emerging experimental theatre, and became a legend like Bal Gandharva in Marathi theatre. In 1937, Ranbhoomi Parishad, was formed in Ahmedabad which tried to present major dramatists of the period on common platform for the first time. K. M. Munshi wrote notable social satiresDas, p. 158 and foreign plays were getting translated as well, including Ibsen's A Doll's House was translated into Gujarati as Dhinagli by Pranjivan Pathak in 1923, though realism in acting which the production demanded was yet to arrive.Das, p. 57 However, the rise Mehta and Munshi as playwrights unfortunately fell in an era of overall decline of theatre, initiated by the birth of talkies in Indian cinema in the 1930s,Das, p. 169 by the 1950s, the old school professional theatre has all but disappeared, and the itinerant Parsi theatre vanished completely.  Post-independence  In the post-independence era, a new spurt in growth of Gujarati theatre was seen in the 1950s, and theatre groups started rising again in Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Baroda, including Nat Mandal and Rang Mandal, and most notably, the commercial theatre company, Rangbhumi. Besides Mehta, Pragji Dosa, wrote some award-winning play in the 1950s, though playwriting in Gujarati largely remained limited to adaptations and translations. In 1952, Nat Mandal, was formed in Ahmedabad, which once again aimed to provide a common platform to various far flung practitioners of Gujarati theatre. Soon the traditional Bhavai musicals were also revived by theatre directors, like Shanta Gandhi, who wrote and directed Jasma Odan (1968) based on Gujarati folk tale, while Dina Pathak (then Gandhi) produced and performed the lead role in Mena Gujari. In 1957, when she performed the play in front then President, Rajendra Prasad at the Rashtrapati Bhawan in Delhi, it became the first and the only Gujarati play to have achieved the feat so far. Meanwhile, Gujarati diaspora in North America saw not just quality literature coming out from their midst, but also a vibrant Gujarati theatre.Magocsi, p. 637 In Vadodara theatre was patronized by Sayajirao Gaekwad III, and the city dubbed the cultural capital of Gujarat, and known for the Gandharva Natak Mandali. In the 1950, numerous groups were formed in the city including, Nutan Sanskar Kendra, Trimurti, Natya Vihar, Bhartiya Kala Kendra and Universal Art Forum, and the following decades saw formed for groups like Rangavali (1974), Kashunk, Vishkambhak, Aakar Theatre (1980), Intimate, Jayashree Kala Niketan and Navchetan. The city still had ten theatre groups in the 1990s, but gradually lost much of its theatre groups and audiences by the 2000s, despite theatre groups still existing in Surat and Rajkot. After mid 2000s, Gujarati theatre experienced a revival and has been growing steadily. However, the struggle for dominance between double meaning comedies, big stars-led commercial theatre and experimental theatre continues well into the present times, though many have tried to straddle the middle road and bridge the gap. In 2011, National Centre for the Performing Arts (NCPA), Mumbai in an effort to promote experimental theatre hosted its first Gujarati theatre festival, Vasant - Gujarati Natya Utsav.

CRRC’s primary aim is to improve and progress social science research and public policy analysis in the South Caucasus region. CRRC is based on a partnership among the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Eurasia Partnership Foundation, USAID and top local universities. The program establishes a network for scholars, researchers and practitioners to strengthen their research capabilities, integrate various social science research methods and remain engaged with their local research community. CRRC’s regional office is devoted to assisting the country-based centers as they work to establish effective partnerships among academic scholars, policy practitioners, social science research professionals, as well as representatives from governmental and non- governmental sectors. In 2004, CRRC began the largest coordinated data collection effort in the South Caucasus known as the Caucasus Barometer. The Caucasus Barometer is an annually conducted nationwide survey in Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan that covers a wide range of social, economic and political issues in the region. With a sample size of about 6,000 people, the Caucasus Barometer is free and available to the public on CRRC’s website as are most of CRRC’s projects. In addition to the Caucasus Barometer, CRRC conducts over 10 national surveys, focus groups and other research projects every year in the South Caucasus. Fellowship Programs CRRC hosts two fellowship programs. The Junior Fellowship program was established in 2004 to promote and facilitate the performance of local researchers in the South Caucasus at the beginning of their research careers. The program offers fellows the opportunity to gain first-hand research experience with the CRRC team. Fellows also receive rigorous training and contribute to integrating the South Caucasus region into global academic dialogue and discourse. The Junior Fellowship Program has existed in Georgia since 2009, in Azerbaijan since 2011, and in Armenia since 2013. Prior to 2013, the Armenia office has facilitated a long-standing traditional fellowship program. CRRC’s International Fellowship program provides the opportunity for researchers from all over the world to join CRRC centers in Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan for a period of at least 10 weeks. During this time, international fellows analyze regional issues addressing key public policy challenges. They are also encouraged to contribute to CRRC’s research and to work on their own independent research. Libraries and computer resources for the public Each CRRC center has a library and computer lab. These resources provide the public and researchers with a range of information resources such as textbooks, references materials, and journals. The computer labs provide access to on- line journals in the social sciences, as well as databases related to social science in the South Caucasus region.

In the New Testament the laying on of hands was associated with Christ healing the sick () and after his ascension, the receiving of the Holy Spirit (See Acts ). Initially the Apostles laid hands on new believers as well as believers. (See ). In the early church, the practice continued and is still used in a wide variety of church ceremonies, such as during confirmation. Eastern Christianity Ordination of an Eastern Orthodox priest. The deacon being ordained is kneeling at the south west corner of the holy table and the bishop places his omophorion and right hand on the deacon's head and his left hand over his right and is reading the laying on of hands. In Eastern Christianity, laying on of hands is used for the ordination (called cheirotonia) of the higher clergy (bishops, priests and deacons) which is distinguished from the blessing (called cheirothesia) of the lower clergy (taper bearers, readers and subdeacons)Parry (1999), p. 117 as well as making an abbot or abbess or promoting a deacon to archdeacon, etc. Priests and deacons receive the laying on of hands by a single bishop, bishops are consecrated by three or more bishops. The chrism (Greek: myron) which is used at chrismation and the anointing of sovereigns is believed to contain chrism which the Apostles blessed and laid their hands on, the former since some existing chrism is poured into newly consecrated chrism and the latter is stated in the prayer used in the consecration of chrism. This is consecrated and added to as needed by the primates of the autocephalous churches, and is dispersed to priests for their use in administering the sacred mysteries (sacraments). In the Eastern Christian Tradition, anointing with the chrism is the equivalent of laying on of hands. The presentation of this chrism which has received the laying on of hands, together with an antimension is the manner in which a bishop bestows faculties upon a priest under his omophorion (i.e., under his authority). The laying on of hands is also performed at the end of the sacrament of unction. This mystery should be performed by seven priests six of whom lay their hands on a Gospel Book which has been placed over the head of the one being anointed, while the senior priest reads a prayer. Catholicism ordination, the Catholic bishop imposes hands upon the deacon for ordination to the priesthood. During the rite of ordination, after the bishop the priests present lay their hands on the ordinands In the Catholic Church, the laying on of hands is performed in the sacrament of Holy Orders and is the means by which one is included in one of the three major orders: bishop, priest, or deacon. Ordination can be administered only by a bishop in Apostolic Succession (valid), and should only be accomplished by a bishop who is properly authorized by the Holy See (licit). The laying on of hands to the priesthood enables a person so ordained to act in persona Christi; i.e., \\"in the person of Christ.\\" Ordination allows a priest validly to administer sacraments, most notably giving that individual the authority to celebrate the Eucharist. The sacraments of ordination and confirmation are, however, reserved exclusively to a bishop (with certain exceptions). The sacrament of Confirmation is \\"the special outpouring of the Holy Spirit as once granted to the apostles on the day of Pentecost\\", and \\"brings an increase and deepening of baptismal grace.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church, paragraphs 1302-1303. In the Western Latin-Rite Latin Church, the sacrament is customarily conferred only on persons old enough to understand it, and the ordinary minister of Confirmation is a bishop. Only for a serious reason may the diocesan bishop delegate a priest to administer the sacrament (canon 884 of the Code of Canon Law). However, a priest may by law confer the sacrament, if he baptizes someone who is no longer an infant or admits a person already baptized to full communion, or if the person (adult or child) to be confirmed is in danger of death (canon 883). Anglicanism Episcopal Church Laying on of hands is part of Anglican confirmation, anointing of the sick,http://stmarks.byethost9.com/ for example: Book of Alternative Services – Anglican Church of Canada, p. 555 and other parts of liturgy and pastoral offices. The Guild of St Raphael, founded in 1915, is an organization within the Anglican church specifically dedicated to promoting, supporting and practicing Christ's ministry of healing through the laying on of hands as an integral part of the Church. The laying on of hands is also performed in the sacrament of Holy Orders and is the means by which one is included in one of the three ordained orders of the church: bishop, priest, or deacon. Ordination can be administered only by a bishop in Apostolic Succession. Pentecostalism Members of the Pentecostal Church of God of Lejunior, Kentucky, lay hands on a girl during prayer in 1946. Pentecostal Christians practice the laying on of hands as part of prayer for divine healing and the anointing of the sick. Christopher A. Stephenson, Types of Pentecostal Theology: Method, System, Spirit, OUP USA, USA, 2012, p. 64 While laying on of hands is not required for healing, Pentecostals believe that, in addition to its biblical origins, the act of touching is an encouragement to faith.Assemblies of God, Laying on of Hands and Anointing the Sick with Oil , accessed October 29, 2016. Baptists In Baptist churches, the laying on of hands takes place after a believer's baptism. John H. Y. Briggs, A Dictionary of European Baptist Life and Thought, Wipf and Stock Publishers, USA, 2009, p. 296 This is one of the two points which was added in the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith in 1742. William H. Brackney, Historical Dictionary of the Baptists, Scarecrow Press, USA, 2009, p.525-526 Bill J. Leonard, Baptists in America, Columbia University Press, USA, 2005, p. 76 In adherence to strict autonomy and autocephalocy, the Southern Baptist Church does not officially prescribe, reject, or affirm the practice of laying on of hands. Each church is expected to decide the matter for itself between its clergy and its congregation. In regards to ordination, the laying of hands is representative of authorizing, permitting, and recognizing the calling of the receipiant to the clergy. Southern Baptist Christians employ the laying on of hands during the ordination of clergymen (such as deacons, assistant, and senior pastors) as well as situations of calling for divine healing. The laying of hands generally encompasses three different variations. Some, all, or none of these are employed at each church, based on each congregation's preferences. * The primary use of laying of hands is ordination. When a man is accepted to join the clergy, either as a deacon or a pastor (etc.), he is brought before the altar and prayed over by either the sitting pastor or a senior deacon. Each previously ordained, former or current, clergyman of any rank then line up and lay their hands upon the new clergyman, one at a time, and pray over him. * The second usage of the laying of hands is in faith healing and in commissioning, which itself works in two forms. Anointing of the sick is a practice explicitly authorized in the Bible\\"Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord.\\" Holy Bible, James 5:14 (NIV) and is performed by the clergy. In circumstances where all secular medical options have been exhausted (including but not limited to the dying), or treatment has stalled, or the diagnosis is unknown, the clergy are called to the recipient's house, where they anoint the head of the infirm with oil and proceed to lay their hands upon them, simultaneously, and pray over them. The Baptist Church does not teach that neither physical healing nor medical guidance to doctors is invoked by or within the anointing. Therefore, God may or may not grant physical healing to the sick in spite of the act. The healing conferred by anointing is thus a spiritual event that may not result in physical recovery. * The third and final usage is used to commission certain parties of missionaries going abroad for an extended period of time. This act, performed by the laity and clergy at the same time, involves the entire congregation rising and gathering around the parties, laying their hands upon the recipient 's body, or on the bodies of those in front of them as a chain, as the clergy (normally the pastor) pray over them. This action can also be used as an invocation of medical guidance or, in terminal situations, as faith healing. Like baptism and the administration of the Lord's Supper (the Eucharist), Southern Baptists believe the laying of hands to be a solely ceremonial action which, while still holy and important, does not empower or invoke the specific task it is used to call for. In ordination, the laying of hands is not empowering the individual to serve in the clergy, but to authorize and recognize his spiritual gifts and his calling to do so. In healing, it is to ascribe urgency and importance, not to invoke actual healing. Southern Baptists do not believe that God's power can be invoked by man, but that the decision to heal or not heal is God's will alone. Catharism A Cathar Perfect, the highest initiate in the Cathar hierarchy after spending time as a Listener and then Believer, had to undergo a rigorous training of three years before being inducted as a member of the spiritual elite of the now defunct religious movement. This took place during a ceremony in which various Scriptural extracts were quoted, including, most particularly, the opening verses of the Gospel of John. The ceremony was completed by a ritual laying on of hands, also known as Manisola, as the candidate vowed to abjure the world and accept the Holy Spirit . At this point, the Perfecti believed, the Holy Spirit was able to descend and dwell within the new Perfect -- hence the austere lifestyle needed to provide a pure dwelling place for the Spirit. Once in this state of housing the Holy Spirit within themselves, the Perfect were believed to have become \\"trans- material\\" or semi-angelic, not yet released from the confines of the body but containing within them an enhanced spirituality which linked them to God even in this world, as expressed in the Gospel of Luke. The Cathars were decimated and annihilated as a sect during the Albigensian Crusade. Mormonism Along with others in the Latter Day Saint movement, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believe the restoration of Christ's priesthood came about by the laying on of hands by John the Baptist to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. The laying on of hands is seen as a necessary part of confirmation and ordination to the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods. In addition to these confirmations and ordinations, worthy Melchizedek priesthood holders lay their hands on the head of one receiving a blessing of healing, comfort, or counsel.

Life He was seventh son of John Clubbe, rector of Whatfield in Suffolk, baptised at Whatfield on 16 April 1745. He was educated at Newcome's School and Caius College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1762 and graduated LL.B. in 1769. In the same year he was instituted to the rectory of Flowton, and in the following year to the vicarage of Brandeston, both in Suffolk. He took an antiquarian interest in brasses and other materials removed on the restoration work in Letheringham church, a modernisation pushed through by Thomas Rede, attorney at Beccles. Clubbe lived at Brandeston until 1808, when, having lost his wife, he moved to the house of his youngest brother, Nathaniel, an attorney at Framlingham. There he died on 16 October 1814. His wife was Mary, daughter of the Rev. William Henchman; they had no issue. His biography appeared in vol. 6 of Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century by John Nichols, where he was called second son of John Clubbe. Works His works include: * The Emigrants, a Pastoral, Ipswich, 1793. * Six Satires of Horace; in a style between free imitation and literal version, Ipswich, 1795.

Its aim is to simplify the development and maintainability of expressive HTML5 applications by employing many of the foundations of proven native application frameworks. With Montage, developers can build and extend reusable user interface components and modules, bind properties among components and controllers, and synchronize DOM updates to ensure a smooth user experience, especially on resource-constrained devices.  Development History  Montage development started under Benoit Marchant and his team while at Motorola Mobility, from August 2010 to July 2012. The project was open sourced on GitHub in July 2012 under a BSD license. Montage is currently maintained by a Silicon Valley startup whose employees include Marchant and core members of the original development team. The ideas behind Montage date back to Marchant's tenure at Apple (1999−2010) where he worked on native (desktop-like) user interfaces written in JavaScript. Marchant's goal at the time was to create the equivalent of proven technologies such as Cocoa and WebObjects, but for the web and on the client side to facilitate building applications in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The result was Gianduia, a rich Internet application framework introduced by Apple at its 2009 World of WebObjects Developer Conference. In 2010, when Marchant had the opportunity to join Motorola Mobility to work on a new framework for mobile, he took the lessons learned at Apple to build Montage from the ground up using the model–view–controller (MVC) design pattern to partition a Montage application into logically distinct units. Although still evolving, with many more components on the roadmap, Montage has been used to build production-ready applications. Transposing the designs and patterns of native application frameworks onto the field of web-based application development is nothing new. Where Montage differs from its predecessors (such as Cappuccino, for example) is that it doesn't try to introduce a new syntax for the web. Instead, it uses a Cocoa-like API to create a clean layer of abstraction on top of the web stack using modular, self-contained components, real objects and collections, and an API that allows you to observe changes on these objects and their properties or collections.  Features  Montage builds on ECMAScript 5, HTML5, and the CommonJS module system popularized by Node.js. It provides the functionality to build graphical user interfaces providing access to both a set of opinionated UI components as well as standard DOM interface components. However, instead of using a templating system like Mustache, for example, Montage lets developers craft user interface components as stand-alone web pages. An application is merely a component's template opened directly in a web browser. The template contains a DOM skeleton and may require some CSS, but it comes to life with the inclusion of a component object model, distinct but connected to the DOM. Montage also provides string and value manipulation, serialization, and other functions that are not directly tied to the graphical user interface. It uses getters and setters to bind properties, so it maintains performance even as the number of bindings grows. It implements a managed draw cycle, a key part of the Montage architecture, that separates read and write operations at scheduled intervals, so it doesn't compromise performance. And it uses event delegation to manage event handling and dispatching to improve application performance. Part of the MontageJS ecosystem are tools that provide a better developer-optimized experience. These include an initializer, Minit, which generates starter template applications and components, as well as a module system intended for front-end development of web applications using NPM-style packages called MR (short for Montage Require). Montage also comes with a command line tool that translates a developer-optimized experience into a user-optimized experience called Mop (short for Montage optimizer). Mop outputs production-ready Montage applications by reducing the overall file size of the application and creating bundles that can be preloaded or distributed among multiple downloads, to reduce the number of requests and allow developers to release Montage applications with restrictive Content Security Policies.  Compatibility  Montage depends on standardized browser features and works best in modern browsers, including Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari 5+, Internet Explorer 10, Safari Mobile, and Android browser.

It was erected in 2004 when the genus Centaurium (the centauries) was split. Genetic analysis revealed that Centaurium was polyphyletic, made up of plants that could be grouped into four clades. Each became a genus. Centaurium remained, but it is now limited to the Eurasian species. The Mexican species now belong to genus Gyrandra, and the Mediterranean and Australian plants are in genus Schenkia. The new name Zeltnera was given to this genus, which contains most of the North American centauries. There are about 25 species.Mansion, G. (2004). A new classification of the polyphyletic genus Centaurium Hill (Chironiinae, Gentianaceae): Description of the New World endemic Zeltnera, and reinstatement of Gyrandra Griseb. and Schenkia Griseb. Taxon 53:719–740.Mansion, G. and L. Zeltner. (2004). Phylogenetic relationships within the New World endemic Zeltnera (Gentianaceae-Chironiinae) inferred from molecular and karyological data. American Journal of Botany 91(12) 2069-86. Plants of this genus are annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbs. They are taprooted or have fibrous root systems. They produce one or more branching stems which are often ridged and sometimes winged. The leaves are gathered around the lower stem or arranged along the length of the stem. They vary in shape, from linear to lance-shaped to oval, and are green or yellowish. The inflorescence is variable in arrangement. The flower has a tubular throat that opens into a flat corolla with four or five lobes. It may be any shade of pink or white, and the throat is usually paler, to white or yellowish, or occasionally patterned with green. The fruit is a small capsule containing up to 700 minute seeds. Zeltnera and Centaurium species differ mostly in the morphology of the style and stigma, as well as the shape of the fruit capsule. Zeltnera can be subdivided into three groups, a division which is supported by DNA evidence but is most obvious in terms of geography. They are casually named the \\"Californian group\\", the \\"Texan group\\", and the \\"Mexican group\\". The first group is distributed from British Columbia south through the West Coast of the United States and into Baja California. The \\"Texan\\" plants occur from Arizona to Oklahoma in the US and throughout northern Mexico. The \\"Mexican group\\" occurs in Mexico, Central America, and parts of South America. The range may extend north into Arizona. Genus Zeltnera was named for the Swiss botanists Louis and Nicole Zeltner, who have researched Centaurium and other gentians. Species include:Zeltnera.

Organized in 2005 by the UAE's president Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the department is responsible primarily for the management and administration of the emirate's public schools. Additionally, it issues licenses, monitors, and inspects the emirate's many different private schools. Since 2009, it has implemented its New School Model, a project to improve teaching standards in the emirate by increasing the quality of teaching, curriculum, and administration. As part of the New School Model, the department has recruited thousands of licensed teachers from native English speaking countries, such as the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.. Organisation Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, is the sitting chairman.. Below him is the Director General, Dr. Mugheer al Khalili, who has administered the department since 2005. It governs public schools, private schools, and higher education in the Abu Dhabi emirate. These three tiers are divided into three educational zones. Abu Dhabi zone includes the capital city and the surrounding coastal areas, ending its authority near Al Khatim, halfway between Al Ain and Abu Dhabi, and the Dubai-Abu Dhabi border. The Al Ain zone includes Al Ain city and all schools north of Al Ain until the Abu Dhabi emirate-Dubai border, all schools south of Al Ain to Saudi Arabia, and all schools west of Al Ain until Al Khatim on the Al Ain-Abu Dhabi road. Finally, the Western Zone, known as al Gharbia, is the largest by territory but smallest by population. It includes all schools in Abu Dhabi's western region, including some schools on outlying islands. The public school system is divided into three cycles. Cycle 1 is made up of grades 1-5, Cycle 2 of grade 6-9, and Cycle 3 of grades 10-12. All public schools are segregated by sex, except in cycle one. Curriculum from grades 1-9 is currently the New School Model. The curriculum is implemented to varying degrees in Cycle 3, with the exception of grade 12, where students continue to be given examinations based on the federal Ministry of Education's requirements. The emirate currently has 265 public schools.. Private schools must abide by the department's governing rules and guidelines and are inspected once a year. However, they may operate using any approved curriculum they choose, including the United States, Canada, Pakistan, France, and the United Kingdom. There are 185 private schools in the emirate.. Higher education in the emirate also falls under the department's authority. There are 18 higher education institutions.. Criticism and controversy In September 2012, apartments provided by the department suffered a courtyard collapse, rendering the site unsafe for several months. Staff were evacuated to new accommodations. . Local newspapers routinely report high instances of cheating in public schools and universities under the department's supervision. No program yet exists to address academic dishonesty.. Students are reported to have assaulted staff members, including teachers, without police action or administrative involvement from ADEK.. The government-owned English-language newspaper The National wrote about poor student behavior as a factor into why some newly arrived teachers left the country without completing their contracts..

Eastern religions refers to religions originating in the Eastern world—India, China, Japan and Southeast Asia—and thus having dissimilarities with Western religions. This includes the Indian and East Asian religious traditions, as well as animistic indigenous religions. Classification This East-West religious distinction, just as with the East-West culture distinction, and the implications that arise from it, are broad and not precise. Furthermore, the geographical distinction has less meaning in the current context of global transculturation. While many Western observers attempt to distinguish between Eastern philosophies and religions, this is a distinction that does not exist in some Eastern traditions. According to Adams, Indian religions According to Adams, Far Eastern religions Modern Modern machine Modernisation Modernisation refers to a model of an evolutionary transition from a 'pre-modern' or 'traditional' to a 'modern' society. The teleology of modernization is described in social evolutionism theories, existing as a template that has been generally followed by societies that have achieved modernity. While it may theoretically be possible for some societies to make the transition in entirely different ways, there have been no counterexamples provided by reliable sources. Historians link modernization to the processes of urbanization and industrialisation, as well as to the spread of education. As Kendall notes, \\"Urbanization accompanied modernization and the rapid process of industrialization.\\" In sociological critical theory, modernization is linked to an overarching process of rationalisation. When modernization increases within a society, the individual becomes that much more important, eventually replacing the family or community as the fundamental unit of society.Encyclopædia Britannica, \\"Modernisation\\" Mutual cultural exchange Since the late 18th century, an intensive exchange of cultural and religious ideas has been taking place between Asian and western cultures, changing and shaping both cultural hemispheres. In 1785 appeared the first western translation of a Sanskrit-text. Since then, modernisation movements appeared in eastern countries and cultures, such as the Brahmo Samaj and Neo-Vedanta in India, Dharmapala's Maha Bodhi Society, and Buddhist modernism in Japan. In the west, as early as the 19th century the Transcendentalists were influenced by Eastern religions, followed by the Theosophical Society, New Thought, Western Buddhism, the Perennial Philosophy of Aldous Huxley, New Age and Nondualism.

It is unusual as it is much more primitive than other Cretaceous ichthyosaurs, being most closely related to Icthyosaurus itself from the Late Triasic and Early Jurassic, over 70 million years earlier.  Discovery  The holotype and only known specimen was discovered in 1952 by British petroleum geologists D. M. Morton, F. R. S. Henson, R. J. Wetzel and L. C. F. Damesin while working in Chia Gara, Armadia in Iraqi Kurdistan. The slab was being used to dam a small river and was part of a mule track. It was then transported back to the UK and donated to the Natural History Museum in 1959. Robert M. Appleby would study the specimen for many years until his death in 2004, but never published a paper, one manuscript submitted to Paleontology in 1979 was rejected due to the uncertain provenance of the specimen.

She is a member of the BC New Democratic Party. Rice was first elected as a member of legislative assembly (MLA) in the 2013 provincial election and was re-elected in the 2017 election. In the 40th Parliament of British Columbia she acted as the official opposition's critic for northern and rural economic development and deputy critic for children and family development and introduced one private member bill, the Drinking Water Protection (Safe Water for Schools) Amendment Act regarding regularizing testing of drinking water in schools. Prior to the election as an MLA, Rice served a year and a half as a municipal councillor in the city of Prince Rupert, British Columbia. Since moving to Prince Rupert to attend the coastal ecology program at Northwest Community College (now Coast Mountain College)), she has worked a biological technician, a staff member at the T. Buck Suzuki Environmental Foundation, and a scuba diving and kayaking instructor. Background Jennifer Rice was born and raised in Ottawa, Ontario. Following high school she worked at long-term care facilities and as an open water scuba diving and kayaking instructor. She moved to Prince Rupert, British Columbia, in 2003 to attend Northwest Community College's coastal ecology program. She helped open the World Wildlife Fund's Prince Rupert office as a volunteer and a staff member. She acted as chair of the non-profit organization called the Friends of Wild Salmon and, in 2009, she went to work for the T. Buck Suzuki Foundation. During this time she was a vocal opponent of the Northern Gateway project. She was elected to the Prince Rupert city council in 2011 and was on council when they unanimously voted to oppose the Northern Gateway project. North Coast MLA Gary Coons announced his retirement in September 2012. To replace him as the NDP candidate in the next election, Rice and teacher, and president of the Prince Rupert District Teachers Union, Joanna Larson put the names forward. In the January 2013 nomination election, Rice defeated Larson. In the general election, Rice was challenged by Judy Fraser of the BC Liberal Party and college professor Hondo Arendt of the Green Party, though Rice was favoured to win. 40th Parliament Entering the 40th Parliament of British Columbia Jennifer Rice was viewed as a MLA that provided the BC NDP with credibility on environmental issues. She was assigned to be critic on rural and northern health and deputy critic to the Ministry of Children and Family Development and appointed to the Select Standing Committee on Children and Youth. In this critic role she toured rural BC, including stops in Clearwater, Ashcroft, Quesnel, Dawson Creek, Fort Nelson, as well as Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands, to consult with healthcare service providers, advocates, and new parents using maternity care. She also spent the third and fourth sessions on the Select Standing Committee on Health and the fifth session on the Select Standing Committee on Finance and Government Services. Rice was vocal in drawing attention to the Highway of Tears and, in particular, advocating for implementation of the recommendation from the Missing Women Commission of Inquiry for more transportation options along Highway 16 between Prince George and Prince Rupert. Despite the Inquiry's recommendation, the provincial government's Passenger Transportation Board approved a reduction of intercity bus service, provided by Greyhound Canada, along that route in 2013. Along with fellow NDP MLAs Carole James and Maurine Karagianis, Rice traveled the highway together advocating for shuttle bus service. Over the next few years, the province committed funds to assisting communities in purchasing public transit vehicles, extending their routes towards Highway 16, and increasing the number of licensed drivers in First Nations. Regular bus service was eventually implemented and began in 2017. In November 2014 Ms. Rice drew attention to the issue of charging passengers who use wheelchairs an extra $30 for a cabin on the Inside Passage and Haida Gwaii ferry routes, labelling the practice as unfair. In response Transportation Minister Todd Stone indicated he would reverse this practice. Concerning liquefied natural gas, several export facilities were proposed or undergoing environmental assessments within her riding. Rice opposed the development of the Petronas Pacific Northwest LNG facility on Lelu Island, with its proposed bridge over the Flora Banks to the shipping terminal, due to its anticipated impacts to the Skeena River salmon ecosystem. Along with the region's other two NDP MLAs, Doug Donaldson of Stikine and Robin Austin of Skeena, she endorsed the signing of the Lelu Island Declaration by the Nine Allied Tribes of Lax Kw’alaams which called for permanent protection of Lelu Island and the Flora and Agnew Banks \\"as a refuge for wild salmon and marine resources\\", though the Tsimshian First Nations objected to the signing of the declaration.\\"Lelu Island Declaration Made Without Tsimshian Nations' Support\\". Market Wired, January 25, 2016. Rice expressed support of the development of an LNG facility within her riding given proper siting conditions. Rice introduced a private member's bill in April 2016, Drinking Water Protection (Safe Water for Schools) Amendment Act (Bill M-215), which would require the regular testing of drinking water in schools. The bill was in response to elevated lead levels found in Prince Rupert and Kitimat schools, and had the support of the British Columbia Teachers' Federation. The bill did not advance beyond the first reading, but the government still adopted a system of reminders for school districts to test for lead on an annual basis and report back to the Ministry of Education. Independent MLA Vicki Huntington and political columnist Vaughn Palmer praised Rice for her work on drinking water safety. 41st Parliament As the 2017 general election approached, Rice was acclaimed as the BC NDP candidate in the North Coast riding. She was challenged by former Prince Rupert mayor and community relations advisor (for a company seeking to build a LNG facility) Herb Pond for the BC Liberals and Hondo Arendt again for the BC Green Party. Rice was re-elected with over 50% of the vote. With Rice's BC NDP forming the government beginning with the second session of the 41st Parliament of British Columbia, Premier John Horgan appointed Rice to be the Parliamentary Secretary for Emergency Preparedness within the Ministry of Public Safety. With the resignation of local Member of Parliament Nathan Cullen, Rice was considered as a suitable NDP nominee, however she declined.

Leveraged ETFs / ETPs have been part of the investment scene in North America since ProShares introduced \\"Ultra ProShares\\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/mutualfund/07/leveraged_etfs.asp in 2006 and have since grown rapidly.http://seekingalpha.com/article/850221-the-38-million-dollar-levered- etf-share Even though this was preceded by the introduction of the world's first leveraged ETFs in Sweden in 2005 by XACThttp://en.xact.se/Our- ETFs/Leveraged/XACT-Bull/#tab=facts the European market remained underdeveloped. The ETF market in Europe is generally seen to be five to ten years behind the American market, a theory that appears to be consistent with leveraged ETPs. Due to the offerings of companies like PowerShares and Direxion the US ETF market has a range of 3x leveraged and inverse ETFs, this is not the case in Europe. Having spotted an opportunity to create niche value Boost ETP was set up in order to satisfy European demand for 3x leveraged and short ETPs. In 2014, WisdomTree Investments acquired a majority stake (75%) in Boost ETP. WisdomTree will invest $20 million in Boost ETP to give it working capital to build out its European business. Product structure Boost ETP's swap-based model incorporates features from both \\"unfunded\\" and \\"funded\\" swap operating models. When Boost ETP issues a product to an investor the capital received is transferred to the swap counterparty. However, as the products are three times leveraged the counterparty is offering 3 times the exposure whilst only receiving one third of the value of the swap, meaning that the swap is both funded and unfunded. Traditionally speaking ETFs are broken into two categories: * Asset-backed (physical replication). Broadly speaking this is a type of ETF that invests its capital directly into the underlying asset it is attempting to replicate. A physical ETF attempting to replicate a given equity index will (in theory) purchase all of the shares in that index, aggregate them into a 'basket' and then sell shares of the basket to investors. In cases where there are too many shares in an index to purchase efficiently the ETF issuer will use a method called \\"stratified sampling\\" whereby the issuer purchases a sample of the index that is closely correlated to the overall index.http://www.etf.db.com/UK/EN/binaer_view.asp?BinaerNr=1224 * Synthetic. This method consists of an ETF manager entering into a swap contract with an investment bank that agrees to pay the index return in exchange for a small fee and any returns on collateral held in the ETF portfolio.http://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/etfs/etfsolutions.aspx?docid=324200 As of May 2011 synthetic ETFs outnumber physical ETFs by a ratio of around 2:1http://www.indexuniverse.eu/europe/opinion-and-analysis/7862-synthetic-etf- boom-slows.html and have grown in popularity due to reduced fees associated with synthetic structures, which in turn, lends itself to delivering superior tracking error, or in layman's terms; synthetic ETFs track their underlying asset more closely. This synthetic replication is done with the use of complex derivative strategies or swaps. Types of swaps: * Funded swaps: this means that the capital raised by the ETP issuer is handed directly over to the swap counterparty. * Unfunded swaps: in this case the capital raised by the ETP issuer is not handed over to the swap counterparty, the capital is generally given to an independent custodian who keeps the capital in a ring-fenced account.

In a similar fashion to vanilla exchange traded products investors that take on leveraged ETPs/ETFs expose themselves to the performance of an underlying asset. However, unlike a standard ETP/ETF, a leveraged product will return a multiple of the return of the underlying asset to the investor. Common leverage factors are 2x, 3x and 5x meaning that the product will return 200%, 300% or 500% of the daily performance of the underlying asset.http://www.advisorone.com/2013/04/01/tactical-trading-with-long-short- etps Leveraged ETFs / ETPs Leveraged ETFs / ETPs are generally split into two categories: * Leveraged ETFs / ETPs These ETPs will result in a direct multiple of the return of an underlying asset. Therefore, a 3x leveraged ETP tracking the FTSE 100 will amplify the daily return of the underlying index by a multiple of 3. If the underlying index returns 1% the ETP will return 3%, if the underlying index returns -1% the ETP will return -3%.http://www.marketwatch.com/story/profunds-readies-first-leveraged-etfs * Inverse ETFs / ETPs Conversely, a 3x short ETP will return three times the inverse of the index it is tracking. If the underlying index returns 1% the ETP will return -3%, if the underlying index returns -1% the ETP will return 3%. The fact that the value of inverse ETPs rises during a declining market environment makes these investments very popular in bear markets. = Rebalancing method = Most leveraged ETPs employ a method of daily rebalancing in order to deliver the correct multiple of index returns on that day. This can result in beta slippage whereby the movements in the underlying index can affect the overall value of the ETP by a disproportionate amount.http://www.investopedia.com/articles/exchangetradedfunds/07/leveraged- etf.asp Boost ETP products Equity linked ETPs: * Boost FTSE 100 1x Short Daily ETP LSE : SUK1 * Boost FTSE 100 2x Leverage Daily ETP LSE : 2UKL * Boost FTSE 100 2x Short Daily ETP LSE : 2UKS * Boost FTSE 100 3x Leverage Daily ETP * Boost FTSE 100 3x Short Daily ETP * Boost FTSE 250 1x Short Daily ETP LSE : 1MCS * Boost FTSE 250 2x Leverage Daily ETP LSE : 2MCL * Boost EURO STOXX® 50 3x Leverage Daily ETP * Boost EURO STOXX® 50 3x Short Daily ETP * Boost LevDAX® 3x Daily ETP * Boost LevDAX® 3x Daily ETP (£) * Boost ShortDAX® 3x Daily ETP * Boost ShortDAX® 3x Daily ETP (£) * Boost S&P; 500® 3x Leverage Daily ETP * Boost S&P; 500® 3x Short Daily ETP * Boost NASDAQ 100® 3x Leverage Daily ETP * Boost NASDAQ 100® 3x Short Daily ETP Commodity linked ETPs: * Boost Natural Gas 2x Leverage Daily ETP LSE : 2NGL * Boost Natural Gas 2x Short Daily ETP LSE : 2NGS * Boost Natural Gas 3x Leverage Daily ETP * Boost Natural Gas 3x Short Daily ETP * Boost WTI Oil 3x Leverage Daily ETP (£) * Boost WTI Oil 3x Leverage Daily ETP * Boost WTI Oil 3x Short Daily ETP (£) * Boost WTI Oil 3x Short Daily ETP * Boost Gold 1x Short Daily ETP LSE : 1GOS * Boost Gold 2x Leverage Daily ETP LSE : 2GOL * Boost Gold 2x Short Daily ETP LSE : 2GOS * Boost Gold 3x Leverage Daily ETP (£) * Boost Gold 3x Leverage Daily ETP * Boost Gold 3x Short Daily ETP (£) * Boost Gold 3x Short Daily ETP * Boost Silver 2x Leverage Daily ETP LSE : 2SIL * Boost Silver 2x Short Daily ETP LSE : 2SIS * Boost Silver 3x Leverage Daily ETP (£) * Boost Silver 3x Leverage Daily ETP * Boost Silver 3x Short Daily ETP (£) * Boost Silver 3x Short Daily ETP * Boost Palladium 1x Short Daily ETP LSE : 1PAS * Boost Palladium 2x Leverage Daily ETP LSE : 2PAL * Boost Copper 3x Leverage Daily ETP * Boost Copper 3x Short Daily ETP  Awards  In its first year of existence Boost ETP won the ETF Express \\"Most Innovative European ETP Provider\\" for 2013.http://www.etfexpress.com/2013/03/26/182154/etfexpress- global-awards-2013-winners Issuers of ETFs List of Exchange Traded Fund issuers.

This example is in the Canada Aviation and Space Museum. The Quickie Q2 or Q2 is a two-seat version of the unique Rutan Quickie, produced in kit form by the Quickie Aircraft Corporation founded by Tom Jewett and Gene Sheehan. Canadian Garry LeGare was involved in the design. The Q2 is a tandem wing design, having one forward wing (canard) and one rear wing (instead of the more usual main wing and horizontal stabilizer). The elevators are fitted to the forward wing so that all pitch control comes from the forward wing, similar to the canard configuration. The Q2 is a \\"taildragger\\" with fixed (non-retractable) main wheels incorporated into integral streamlined wheel pants located at the tips of the forward wing. As efficient as the original Q1 design, the Q2 is of composite construction.  Design and development  The Q2 followed Jewett's and Sheehan's intention to design a two-seat homebuilt aircraft. An amateur aircraft builder who had already built a Rutan VariEze, LeGare suggested a two-place side-by-side development of the Quickie equipped with a larger Volkswagen derived engine. At the time, Sheehan and Jewett were not interested so LeGare fabricated a single proof of concept prototype.\\"How About A Quickie For Two?\\", by Peter Lert, QAC distributed Air Progress Article — April 1981Rutan, Sport Aviation Unlike the original single-seat Quickie, Rutan was not involved with the design of the Q2, but it retains the Rutan tandem wing solution to the design challenges associated with low drag, high-efficiency design, with a fixed undercarriage and a useful center of gravity range. Pilot and passenger seating placement was close to the center of gravity, the integral wheel pants substantially reduced parasitic drag, and the tandem wing placement and decalage made for natural angle-of-attack limiting (i.e., natural stall recovery with a pitch buck onset). The aircraft was a point design, configured at a time of high fuel prices, increasing costs for the sport pilot, and in the wake of the Bede BD-5. The Q2 was configured as a \\"taildragger\\" with fixed (non-retractable) integral wheel pants at the tips of a forward wing with a noticeable adhedral. The wheel pants acted as endplates (increasing effective aspect ratio) and constraining spanwise flow. As a result, the original aircraft configuration was an effective ekranoplan and exhibited surface effect phenomenon when within a half wingspan distance from the ground. The absence of separate landing gear in the original configurations (e.g. Q-1 through Q-200) reduced both weight and drag; however, much of the configurational advantage was lost in the Tri-Q modification. Propeller ground clearance was a problem in the early Quickie aircraft fabricated with highly flexible fiberglass spar caps... and those aircraft were susceptible to prop- strikes during hard landings. Subsequently, the use of full span, tapered, carbon fiber spars in the Q-200 added significant stiffness to the forward wing/canard... this development substantially reduced the tendency of the aircraft to porpoise and experience propeller damage.Martinez builder's log/shop notes & N557BM Q-200 Flight Test Summary, http://www.eaa1000.av.org/fltrpts/q200/testsumm.htm Full-span elevators were fitted to the forward wing such that all pitch control came from the forward wing, similar to the canard configuration.. The forward wing in this configuration provided about 60% of the lift. The close proximity of the engine/propeller to the forward wing made for a powered lift effect with instantaneous climb response to power inputs. The ailerons were located inboard on the aft wing, which was shoulder-mounted centrally, just aft of the pilot; this aileron placement reduced any tendency to aileron induced yaw ... a properly built aircraft would enter a coordinated turn with the pilots feet off the rudder pedals. The canard layout provided positive lift from both pairs of wings, whereas a conventional tailplane supplies negative lift. However, the principal advantage to the Q2/Q200 configuration was probably the reduced size and, therefore, reduced flat plate, wetted area and drag associated with the airframe integration.N557BM Q-200 Flight Test Summary, http://www.eaa1000.av.org/fltrpts/q200/testsumm.htm Q-2/Q-200 pilot controls included a central sidestick controlled by the right hand and a throttle controlled by the left hand. As the pitch and roll control linkages were via a pushrod, the aircraft was very responsive. Routine installations were the inclusion of an aileron reflexor and mid-fuselage belly-board speed brake. The rudder pedals were cable-linked directly to a steerable tailwheel bellcrank, and then via secondary cables to the rudder; this per-plans configuration led to multiple runway mishaps resulting from damage to the fiberglass tailspring that supported the tailwheel bellcrank and subsequent loss of directional control. Many builders addressed this tailwheel design weakness by the placement of a dedicated bellcrank within the aft fuselage and then splitting independent cables to the rudder and tailwheel individually. The Q2/Q200 series of aircraft were highly sensitive to builder variation and required special attention to the ground angle of attack and tailwheel hinge geometry; and, at this stage of American kitplane development, prefabrication of critical components simply was not yet a feature. In flight, the aircraft exhibited Cooper-Harper level 3 flying qualities requiring some degree of pilot compensation during some maneuvers and phases of flight. The Q-200 could be noticeably sensitive in pitch. The recommended landing technique was via a backside approach to the runway threshold. Once on the ground, the aircraft was known to exhibit reversed stick steering if the ailerons were actuated at medium to high speed; this was typically corrected by a neutral control stick and normal rudder correction.http://www.eaa1000.av.org/fltrpts/q200/testsumm.htm); (Quickie Builders Association — QUICKTALK, Jul/Aug 1986, Issue #28, Q-2 Pilot Reports, pg3 The prototype Q2 was constructed in Canada by Garry LeGare at his Leg-Air Aviation, Ltd., facility in Langley, British Columbia.Air Progress — April 1981, Peter Lert How About A Quickie For Two? The airplane was constructed of fiberglass and resin over a foam core, similar to other Rutan designs; the wings essentially blue styrofoam billets cut to shape with a hot wire, followed by microslurry and resin/fiberglass layup; the fuselage was made up of one inch-thick foam slabs with microslurry and resin/fiberglass layup. Subsequent Q-2/Q-200 kit aircraft included fully lofted and prefabricated fuselage shells. The fuselage shells were vacuum bagged in molds and made of inner and outer fiberglass facing with a 3/8 inch Clark foam core.Quickie Aircraft Corporation Q-200 plans/Basic Fuselage Assembly sample page 8-1/2); (Martinez N557bm Shop Notes  Production  In June 1978, only two months after the single-seat Quickie prototype's first flight, Jewett and Sheehan had formed the Quickie Aircraft Corporation to produce and sell complete kits of Quickie layout, first single-seaters, then two-seaters. Kit production commenced in 1980, with over 2000 kits sold before production ended. LeGare and Quickie formed an agreement: While Quickie handled domestic sales within the United States, LeGare would handle export sales. In practice, the export sales were shipped directly from Quickie in California.  Variants  ;Quickie Q2 :This two-seat aircraft employed a 64-horsepower (48 kW) Volkswagen air-cooled engine and could be constructed as a Tri-Q with tricycle rather than conventional landing gear. TriQ-200 with tricycle gear ;Q200 :This two-seat aircraft was substantially faster than the Q2, with a 100-horsepower (78 kW) Continental O-200 engine and employed an LS-1 airfoil for the canard to avoid canard leading edge contamination issues. Q-200 aircraft have been powered with other engines, including Mazda, Subaru, Rotax, and Corvair engines in the same horsepower range, with varying degrees of success. It can also be constructed as a Tri-Q with tricycle, rather than conventional landing gear.

In the provincial elections, Esmael Mangudadatu, a vice mayor of the small town of Buluan ran against the Ampatuans, resulting to the gruesome Maguindanao massacre, where 57 people died, including journalists, lawyers and relatives of Mangudadatu while on their way to file his certificate of candidacy. The election-related-violence caught the attention of international media. Mangudadatu asked for the support of Mastura. The Mastura kingmaker, Datu Tucao decided to let Datu Ismael Mastura, his nephew, son of his brother Datu Michael run as the vice governor of Mangudadatu. Tucao declared his support and stayed as the campaign manager.

Global News, May 14, 2013. She represented the electoral district of Burnaby-Lougheed as a member of the British Columbia New Democratic Party from 2013 to 2017. Shin is the first Korean Canadian elected to the provincial legislature. Early life and education Shin was born in South Korea and emigrated to Canada when she was 11 years old. Around her 16th birthday she was hospitalised for a serious health crisis attributed to leukemia or aplastic anaemia. According to Shin, the experience made her a passionate advocate for Canada's health care system. Two months after her 16th birthday, Shin was awarded $400 by the City of Surrey, British Columbia, as part of its inaugural Youth Recognition Awards. As a child, Shin had volunteered for the Canadian Red Cross Society, Greenpeace, the Multicultural Society of B.C. and others. Career before politics Shin studied genetics and cell biology at the University of British Columbia, participating in botanical biochemistry research on the general phenylpropanoid pathway. Shin later completed a doctorate in medicine in 2007 from Spartan Health Sciences University in Vieux Fort, St. Lucia, an institution recognised by the B.C. College of Physicians and Surgeons and the Medical Council of Canada. During medical school, Shin performed clinical rotations at University of Edinburgh, Dalhousie University, and John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital. Shin's rotational research at the Royal Victoria Infirmary of Newcastle upon Tyne led to two co- authored publications on chronic fatigue syndrome. Shin later decided that she preferred teaching over conventional medical practice and chose not complete the residency necessary to gain a license to practice medicine in British Columbia. Shin has taught at British Columbia Institute of Technology, Vancouver Community College, and the West Coast College of Massage Therapy. Provincial politics Shin's intention to seek the Burnaby-Lougheed NDP nomination under the party leadership of Adrian Dix was announced in May 2012. Shin's competitor for the nomination was Craig Langston. Shin won the nomination in November 2012, ahead of the 2013 provincial election. During the campaign, Shin faced allegations that she had misrepresented her educational credentials in her campaign materials, although she quickly corrected the misunderstandings and clarified that they were not intentional. Shin won 44.26% of the vote, defeating BC Liberal candidate Ken Kramer who had replaced retiring Harry Bloy who had held the riding for 12 years. Confusion surrounding Shin's credentials, her campaign, and controversy surrounding the BC Conservative Candidate Christine Clark earned Shin the title of 2013 Newsmaker of the Year from the Burnaby Now. While in office, Shin was assigned several portfolios and roles within the Shadow Cabinet including: the deputy spokesperson for Trade, Immigration, and Multiculturalism, the deputy spokesperson role for International Trade, Asia Pacific Strategy, Multiculturalism, Immigration, Intergovernmental Relations, the deputy spokesperson role for Small Business, Tourism, and Arts and Culture, and served on the Select Standing Committee for Health. Shin's first motion was a private member's bill to permit electronic petitions from the public to be accepted by the legislature. The bill was designed to enhance petitioning with increased accessibility and efficiency. Shin later introduced Bill M-215, the Business Practices and Consumer Protection (Money Transfers) Amendment Act which sought to cap the fees a money broker can charge for international money transactions. In late 2016 Shin announced that she would not run for re- election. The BC NDP nominated Katrina Chen, a Burnaby school board trustee who subsequently defeated the BC Liberal candidate Steve Darling. Career after politics After the 2017 BC Provincial election, Shin returned to Vancouver Community College as Dean of Student Development, responsible for the strategic advancement and operational management of student service departments. In 2019, Shin was promoted to Associate Vice-President of Student Success at VCC, adding new mandates for Indigenous Education & Community Engagement, Student Wellness, Career Development, and Strategic Enrollment Management at the institution. In 2019, Shin was named as one of Canada's Top 25 Immigrants by the Canadian Immigrant. Shin completed the Women in Leadership Program at Cornell University. In 2020, Shin completed a Master of Education degree at Simon Fraser University. As of 2020, Shin is presently conducting Ph.D studies at the University of Toronto in Leadership, Higher & Adult Education. In addition to her current academic roles at VCC and studies at the University of Toronto, Shin is also on the Board of the DIVERSEcity Society, and as the legacy ambassador for the BC Children's Hospital Foundation.

The observance is sometimes called a rosatio (\\"rose-adornment\\") or the dies rosationis, \\"day of rose-adornment,\\" and could be celebrated also with violets (violatio, an adorning with violets, also dies violae or dies violationis, \\"day of the \\").C.R. Phillips, The Oxford Classical Dictionary, edited by Simon Hornblower and Anthony Spawforth (Oxford University Press, 1996, 3rd edition), p. 1335; CIL 6.10264, 10239, 10248 and others. Other names include dies rosalis, dies rosae and dies rosaliorum: CIL 3.7576, 6.10234, 6.10239, 6. 10248. As a commemoration of the dead, the rosatio developed from the custom of placing flowers at burial sites. It was among the extensive private religious practices by means of which the Romans cared for their dead, reflecting the value placed on tradition (mos maiorum, \\"the way of the ancestors\\"), family lineage, and memorials ranging from simple inscriptions to grand public works. Several dates on the Roman calendar were set aside as public holidays or memorial days devoted to the dead.Peter Toohey, \\"Death and Burial in the Ancient World,\\" in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome (Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 366–367. As a religious expression, a rosatio might also be offered to the cult statue of a deity or to other revered objects. In May, the Roman army celebrated the Rosaliae signorum, rose festivals at which they adorned the military standards with garlands. The rose festivals of private associations and clubs are documented by at least forty- one inscriptions in Latin and sixteen in Greek, where the observance is often called a rhodismos.Christina Kokkinia, \\"Rosen für die Toten im griechischen Raum und eine neue Rodismos Bithynien,\\" Museum Helveticum 56 (1999), pp. 209–210, noting that rhodismos is attested in glosses as equivalent to rosalia. Flowers were traditional symbols of rejuvenation, rebirth, and memory, with the red and purple of roses and violets felt to evoke the color of blood as a form of propitiation.Patricia Cox Miller, The Corporeal Imagination: Signifying the Holy in Late Ancient Christianity (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2009), p. 74.

Dent, 1928), p. 43. In some areas of the Empire, the Rosalia was assimilated to floral elements of spring festivals for Dionysus, Adonis and others, but rose-adornment as a practice was not strictly tied to the cultivation of particular deities, and thus lent itself to Jewish and Christian commemoration.A.S.

A lavish display of flowers was an expression of conviviality and liberal generosity. An Imperial- era business letter surviving on papyrus attempts to soothe a bridegroom's mother upset that the rose harvest was insufficient to fill her order for the wedding; the suppliers compensated by sending 4,000 narcissus instead of the 2,000 she requested.Oxyrhynchus Papyri 331.1–21; The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome, p. 30. While flowers were a part of Roman weddings, the bridegroom was more likely than the bride to wear a flower crown; Statius (1st century AD) describes a groom as wearing a wreath of roses, violets, and lilies.Statius, Silvae 1.20; Hersch, The Roman Wedding, p. 90.

Venus wearing a crown of roses over the body of Adonis, in the Venus and Adonis (1637) of José de Ribera Classical mythology preserves a number of stories in which blood and flowers are linked in divine metamorphosis.Miller, The Corporeal Imagination, p. 74. When Adonis, beloved of Aphrodite, was killed by a boar during a hunt, his blood produced a flower. A central myth of the Roman rites of Cybele is the self-castration of her consort Attis, from whose blood a violet-colored flower sprang. In the Gnostic text On the Origin of the World, possibly dating to the early 4th century,Hans-Gebhard Bethge, Bentley Layton, Societas Coptica Hierosolymitana, \\"On the Origin of the World (II,5 and XIII,2),\\" in The Nag Hammadi Library in English: The Definitive New Translation of the Gnostic Scriptures Complete in One Volume (Brill, 1977, rev. ed. 1996), p. 170. the rose was the first flower to come into being, created from the virgin blood of Psyche (\\"Soul\\") after she united sexually with Eros.The examples of Attis, Adonis, On the Origin of the World from Miller, The Corporeal Imagination, p. 74. In the 4th-century poem Cupid Crucified by the Gallo-Roman poet Ausonius, the god Cupid (the Roman equivalent of Eros) is tortured in the underworld by goddesses disappointed in love, and the blood from his wounds causes roses to grow.Miller, The Corporeal Imagination, p. 75. In Egyptian religion, funerary wreaths of laurel, palm, feathers, papyrus, or precious metals represented the \\"crown of justification\\" that the deceased was to receive when he was judged in the Weighing of the Heart ceremony of the afterlife. In the Imperial period, the wreath might be roses, under the influence of the Romanized cult of Isis.Lorelei H. Corcoran and Marie Svoboda, Herakleides: A Portrait Mummy from Roman Egypt (Getty Publications, 2010), p. 32. The statue of Isis was adorned with roses following the Navigium Isidis, an Imperial holiday March 5 when a ceremonial procession represented the \\"sailing\\" of Isis.Apuleius, Metamorphoses 11.6.1; Miller, The Corporeal Imagination, p. 74. In the Metamorphoses of Apuleius, the protagonist Lucius is transformed into an ass, and after a journey of redemption returns to human form by eating roses and becoming an initiate into the mysteries of Isis.

Brenk, Clothed in Purple Light: Studies in Vergil and in Latin Literature (Franz Steiner, 1999), pp. 87, 102. In Greece, roses appear on funerary steles, and in epitaphs most often of girls.Brenk, Clothed in Purple Light p. 87. In Imperial-era Greek epitaphs, the death of an unmarried girl is compared to a budding rose cut down in spring; a young woman buried in her wedding clothes is \\"like a rose in a garden\\"; an eight-year-old boy is like the rose that is \\"the beautiful flower of the Erotes\\" (\\"Loves\\" or Cupids).Brenk, Clothed in Purple Light, p. 87, note 2. As a symbol of both blooming youth and mourning, the rose often marks a death experienced as untimely or premature.Brenk, Clothed in Purple Light, p. 88. In the Iliad, Aphrodite anoints Hector's corpse with \\"ambrosial oil of roses\\"As translated by Robert Fagles. to maintain the integrity of his body against abuse in death.Iliad 23.185–187; Cyrino, Aphrodite, pp. 63, 94. Wooden cult statues might be anointed periodically with rose oil as a preservative, according to Pausanias (9.41.7): Barbara Breitenberger, Aphrodite and Eros: The Development of Greek Erotic Mythology (Routledge, 2007), p. 60. In Greek and Latin poetry, roses grow in the blessed afterlife of the Elysian Fields.Brenk, Clothed in Purple Light, pp. 102–104, 113, citing Pindar, frg. 129 (edition of Snell); Propertius 4.7.59–62. Bloodless sacrifice to the dead could include rose garlands and violets as well as libations of wine,Hersch, The Roman Wedding, p. 91, citing Ovid. and Latin purpureus expressed the red- to-purple color range of roses and violets particularly as flowers of death. In ancient etymology, purpureus was thought related to Greek porphyreos in the sense of suffusing the skin with purple blood in bruising or wounding. The Augustan epic poet Vergil uses the metaphor of a purple flower to describe the premature, bloody deaths of young men in battle:Vergil, Aeneid 6.884 and 9.434–437; Brenk, Clothed in Purple Light, pp. 89–90, 112–113. The death of Pallas evokes both the violet of Attis and the hyacinth generated from the dying blood of Apollo's beloved Hyacinthus.J.D. Reed, Virgil's Gaze: Nation and Poetry in the Aeneid (Princeton University Press, 2007), p. 22. Claudian writes of the \\"bloody splendor\\" of roses in the meadow from which Proserpina will be abducted to the underworld, with hyacinths and violets contributing to the lush flora.Claudian, De rapto Proserpina 2.92–93: sanguineo splendore rosas. Roses and the ominous presence of thorns may intimate bloodshed and mortality even in the discourse of love.Rosenmeyer, The Poetics of Imitation, pp. 211–212. A wreathed maenad (attendant of Dionysus) holds Cupid as he extends a rose, in a wall painting from the House of Lucius Caecilius Iucundus, Pompeii Conversely, roses in a funerary context can allude to festive banqueting, since Roman families met at burial sites on several occasions throughout the year for libations and a shared meal that celebrated both the cherished memory of the beloved dead and the continuity of life through the family line.J.M.C. Toynbee, Death and Burial in the Roman World (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1971, 1996), pp. 62–63; Regina Gee, \\"From Corpse to Ancestor: The Role of Tombside Dining in the Transformation of the Body in Ancient Rome,\\" in The Materiality of Death: Bodies, Burials, Beliefs, Bar International Series 1768 (Oxford, 2008), pp. 59–68. In Roman tomb painting, red roses often spill bountifully onto light ground. These ageless flowers created a perpetual Rosalia and are an expression of Roman beliefs in the soul's continued existence.Toynbee, Death and Burial in the Roman World, p. 63. The bones or ashes of the deceased may be imagined as generating flowers, as in one Latin epitaph that reads: > Here lies Optatus, a child ennobled by devotion: I pray that his ashes may > be violets and roses, and I ask that the Earth, who is his mother now, be > light upon him, for the boy's life was a burden to no one.Toynbee, Death and > Burial in the Roman World, p. 37. Roses were planted at some tombs and mausoleums, and adjacent grounds might be cultivated as gardens to grow roses for adornment or even produce to sell for cemetery upkeep or administrative costs.Toynbee, Death and Burial in the Roman World, pp. 97–98; Claire Holleran, Shopping in Ancient Rome: The Retail Trade in the Late Republic and the Principate (Oxford University Press, 2012), p. 119; John S. Kloppenborg and Richard S. Ascough, Greco-Roman Associations: Texts, Translations, and Commentary. I: Attica, Central Greece, Macedonia, Thrace (Walter de Gruyter, 2011), vol. 1, p. 327 (in regard to bequests made to associations, who might use surplus profit to benefit the membership). In the 19th to the 21st centuries, a profusion of cut and cultivated flowers was still a characteristic of Italian cemeteries to a degree that distinguished them from Anglo-American practice.Jack Goody and Cesare Poppi, \\"Flowers and Bones: Approaches to the Dead in Anglo-American and Italian Cemeteries,\\" in Modes of Comparison: Theory and Practice (University of Michigan Press, 2006), pp. 420–456; the epitaph of Optatus provides an epigraph for the article. See p. 451, note 60, on the possible connection of the Rosalia to the Romanian festival of Rusalii at Whitsuntide, with a citation of Gail Kligman, Căluş: Symbolic Transformation in Romanian Ritual (University of Chicago Press, 1981), and see also Beza, Paganism in Romanian Folklore, pp. 42–43. This difference is one of the Roman Catholic practices criticized by some Protestants, especially in the 19th century, as too \\"pagan\\" in origin.Goody and Poppi, \\"Flowers and Bones,\\" p. 442. Rose and violet festivals Silvanus, holding pomegranates, grapes, and other produce, attended by hound (2nd-3rd century) Although the rose had a long tradition in funerary art,Carole E. Newlands, Statius. Silvae Book II (Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 94. the earliest record of a Roman rose festival named as such dates to the reign of Domitian (81–96 AD),CIL 10.444. and places the observance on June 20.Robert E.A. Palmer, \\"Silvanus, Sylvester, and the Chair of St. Peter,\\" Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 122.4 (1978), p. 226. The inscription was made by a priestly association (collegium) in Lucania devoted to the woodland god Silvanus. It records vows for the wellbeing of the emperor and prescribes a sacrifice to Silvanus on five occasions in the year, among them the Rosalia. Although Silvanus is typically regarded as a deity of the woods and the wild, Vergil describes him as bearing flowering fennel and lilies.Vergil, Eclogue 10.25. In other inscriptions, three donors to Silvanus had adopted the cultic name Anthus (Greek anthos, \\"flower\\") and a fourth, of less certain reading, may have the Latin name Florus, the masculine form of Flora.Palmer, \\"Silvanus, Sylvester, and the Chair of St. Peter,\\" p. 226. Since trees are the form of plant life most often emblematic of Silvanus, his connection with flowers is obscure. His female counterparts the Silvanae, primarily found in the Danubian provinces, are sometimes depicted carrying flower pots or wreaths.Peter F. Dorcey, The Cult of Silvanus: A Study in Roman Folk Religion (Brill, 1992), p. 44. Through his epithet Dendrophorus, \\"Tree- bearer,\\" he was linked to the Romanized cult of Attis and Cybele in which celebrants called dendrophori participated.Dorcey, The Cult of Silvanus, pp. 17, 19, 31, 82. When well-to-do people wrote a will and made end-of-life preparations, they might set aside funds for the maintenance of their memory and care (cura) after death, including rose-adornment. One epitaph records a man's provision for four annual observances in his honor: on the Parentalia, an official festival for honoring the dead February 13; his birthday (dies natalis); and a Rosaria and Violaria.ILS 8366; Regina Gee, \\"From Corpse to Ancestor: The Role of Tombside Dining in the Transformation of the Body in Ancient Rome,\\" in The Materiality of Death: Bodies, Burials, Beliefs, Bar International Series 1768 (Oxford, 2008), p. 64. Guilds and associations (collegia) often provided funeral benefits for members, and some were formed specifically for that purpose. Benefactors might fund communal meals and rose- days at which members of the college honored the dead.John F. Donahue, The Roman Community at Table During the Principate (University of Michigan Press, 2004), p. 132. The College of Aesculapius and Hygia at Rome celebrated a Violet Day on March 22 and a Rose Day May 11, and these flower festivals are frequent among the occasions observed by dining clubs and burial societies.Donahue, The Roman Community at Table, pp. 129–133. Most evidence for the Rosalia comes from Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy), where twenty-four Latin inscriptions referring to it have been found. Ten Latin inscriptions come from the Italian peninsula, three from Macedonia, and four from Thrace, Illyria, and Pannonia. Six Greek inscriptions come from Bithynia, three from Macedonia, and one each from Bulgaria, Scythia, Mysia, Phrygia, Lydia, Asia and Arcadia.Kokkinia, \\"Rosen für die Toten,\\" p. 209. Floral Tribute for Venus (1690 or earlier), attributed to Abraham Brueghel At Pergamon, Rosalia seems to have been a three-day festival May 24–26, beginning with an \\"Augustan day\\" (dies Augusti, a day of Imperial cult marking a birthday, marriage, or other anniversary of the emperor or his family).Steven J. Friesen, Imperial Cults and the Apocalypse of John: Reading Revelation in the Ruins (Oxford University Press, 2001), p. 129. The three-day Rosalia was among the occasions observed by a group of hymnodes, a male choir organized for celebrating Imperial cult, as recorded in a Greek inscription on an early 2nd-century altar. The eukosmos, the officer of \\"good order\\" who presided over the group for a year, was to provide one mina (a monetary unit) and one loaf for celebrating the Rosalia on the Augustan day, which was the first day of the month called Panemos on the local calendar.Friesen, Imperial Cults and the Apocalypse of John, p. 108. The identification of Panemos with a modern month name varies throughout the ancient calendars on which it appears; see Alan E. Samuel, Greek and Roman Chronology: Calendars and Years in Classical Antiquity (C.H. Beck, 1972). On the second of Panemos, the group's priest provided wine, a table setting, one mina, and three loaves for the Rosalia. The grammateus, a secretary or administrator, was responsible for a mina, a table setting worth one denarius, and one loaf for the third day of Rosalia.Friesen, Imperial Cults and the Apocalypse of John, p. 112. The group seems to have functioned like a collegium at Rome, and as a burial society for members.Friesen, Imperial Cults and the Apocalypse of John, p. 111. Inscriptions from Acmonia, in Phrygia, show the Rosalia in the context of the religious pluralism of the Roman Empire. In 95 AD, a bequest was made for a burial society to ensure the annual commemoration of an individual named Titus Praxias. In addition to a graveside communal meal and cash gifts to members, 12 denarii were to be allocated for adorning the tomb with roses. The obligations of membership were both legally and religiously binding: the society had its own tutelary deities who were invoked to oversee and ensure the carrying out of the deceased's wishes. These were Theos Sebastos (= Divus Augustus in Latin), Zeus under the local and unique epithet Stodmenos, Asclepius the Savior (Roman Aesculapius, as in the collegium above), and Artemis of Ephesus.Paul Trebilco, Jewish Communities in Asia Minor (Cambridge University Press, 1991, 1994 reprint), p. 81; Barbara Levick, The Government of the Roman Empire: A Sourcebook (Routledge, 2000, 2nd ed.), pp. 209–210 (with a date of 85, presumably a typographical error since the date is noted as the eleventh consulship of Domitian). On Stodmenos, see Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World, edited by Richard J. A Talbert (Princeton University Press, 2000), p. 971. Acmonia also had a significant Greek-speaking Jewish community, and an inscription dating from the period 215–295 records similar arrangements made for a Jewish woman by her husband. It provides for an annual rose-adornment of the tomb by a legally constituted neighborhood or community association, with the solemn injunction \\"and if they do not deck it with roses each year, they will have to reckon with the justice of God.\\"Trebilco, Jewish Communities in Asia Minor, pp. 78–81. The formula \\"he will have to reckon with God\\" was used only among Jews and Christians in Phrygia, and there is a slighter possibility that the inscription might be Christian.Trebilco, Jewish Communities in Asia Minor, p. 79. The inscription deals with legal titles to property, and unlike Christians at this time, Jews held full rights as Roman citizens to own property. The inscription is among the evidence that Judaism was not isolated from the general religious environment of the Imperial world, since a rosatio could be made without accompanying sacrifices at the tomb. Instead of multiple deities, the Jewish husband honoring his wife invoked the divine justice of his own God, and chose to participate in the customs of the community while adapting them in ways \\"acceptable to his Jewish faith\\".Trebilco, Jewish Communities in Asia Minor, pp. 80–81. Some Jewish wedding practices, including the wearing of rose crowns by the bridegroom or bride, were also compatible with or assimilated from Imperial society in general; Michael L. Satlow, \\"Slipping toward Sacrament: Jews, Christians, and Marriage,\\" in Jewish Culture and Society under the Christian Roman Empire (Peeters, 2002), p. 74. A cult statue is wreathed with roses in A Bacchanal by Sebastiano Ricci (1659–1734) In Imperial-era Macedonia, several inscriptions mention the Rosalia as a commemorative festival funded by bequests to groups such as a vicianus, a village or neighborhood association (from vicus); thiasos, a legally constituted association, often having a religious character; or symposium, in this sense a drinking and social club. In Thessalonica, a priestess of a thiasos bequeathed a tract of grapevines to pay for rose wreaths.Inscriptiones Graecae X/2 260; Richard S. Ascough, \\"Paul's 'Apocolypticism' and the Jesus Associations at Thessalonica and Corinth,\\" in Redescribing Paul and the Corinthians (Society of Biblical Literature, 2011), p. 164. If the Dionysian thiasos disbanded or failed in its duties, the property was to pass to a society of Dryophoroi (\\"Oak-Bearers\\"), or finally to the state.Kloppenborg and Ascough, Greco-Roman Associations, p. 373. In addition to associations of initiates into the mysteries of Dionysus, inscriptions in Macedonia and Thrace record bequests for rose-adornment to thiasoi of Diana (Artemis) and of the little-attested Thracian god or hero Sourogethes, and to a gravediggers' guild.Kloppenborg and Ascough, Greco-Roman Associations, p. 325. The gravediggers were to kindle a tombside fire each year for the Rosalia, and other contexts suggest that the wreaths themselves might be burnt as offerings.Kloppenborg and Ascough, Greco-Roman Associations, pp. 372–374. A distinctive collocation that occurs a few times in Macedonian commemoration is an inscription prescribing the Rosalia accompanied by a relief of the Thracian Horseman.Kloppenborg and Ascough, Greco-Roman Associations, pp. 327–329. Some scholars think that customs of the Rosalia were assimilated into Bacchic festivals of the dead by the Roman military, particularly in Macedonia and Thrace.Hendrik Wagenvoort, \\"The Journey of the Souls of the Dead to the Isles of the Blessed,\\" Mnemosyne 24.2 (1971), p. 124; Martin P. Nilsson, \\"The Bacchic Mysteries of the Roman Age,\\" Harvard Theological Review 46.4 (1953), p. 187. A Greek inscription of 138 AD records a donation for rose-adornment (rhodismos) to the council in Histria, in modern Dobruja, an area settled by the Thracian Bessi, who were especially devoted to Dionysus.Beza, Paganism in Romanian Folklore, p. 43. Macedonia was famed for its roses, but nearly all evidence for the Rosalia as such dates to the Roman period.Kloppenborg and Ascough, Greco-Roman Associations, pp. 327–329. Bacchic rites Although ivy and grapevines are the regular vegetative attributes of Dionysus, at Athens roses and violets could be adornments for Dionysian feasts. In a fragment from a dithyramb praising Dionysus, the poet Pindar (5th century BC) sets a floral scene generated by the opening up of the Seasons (Horae), a time when Semele, the mortal mother of Dionysus, is to be honored: Ariadne (1898) by the pre-Raphaelite John William Waterhouse: the sleeping red-gowned Ariadne is surrounded by roses, with the sailing background implying both the departure of Theseus and the advent of Dionysus, foreshadowed by his leopardsKarl Kilinski II, Greek Myth and Western Art: The Presence of the Past (Cambridge University Press, 2013), p. 106. > ... as the chamber of the purple-robed Horai is opened, > the nectar-bearing flowers bring in the sweet-smelling spring. > Then, then, upon the immortal earth are cast > the lovely tresses of violets, and roses fitted to hair > and voices of songs echo to the accompaniment of pipes > and choruses come to Semele of the circling headband.Pindar, frg. 75 SnM, as > translated for the Loeb Classical Library (1997) by William H. Race and > cited in this context by Riu, Dionysism and Comedy, p. 108, note 58, and > Walter Friedrich Otto, Dionysus: Myth and Cult, translated by Robert B. > Palmer (Indiana University Press, 1965, originally published 1960 in > German), p. 159. Dionysus was an equalizing figure of the democratic polis whose band of initiates (thiasos) provided a model for civic organizations.Richard Seaford, Cosmology and the Polis: The Social Construction of Space and Time in the Tragedies of Aeschylus (Cambridge University Press, 2012), pp. 101–102. A form of Dionysia dating to pre-democratic Athens was the Anthesteria, a festival name some scholars derive from Greek anthos, \\"flower, blossom\\",D. Felton, \\"The Dead,\\" in A Companion to Greek Religion (Blackwell, 2010), p. 89; Jennifer Neils, \\"Children and Greek Religion,\\" in Coming of Age in Ancient Greece: Images of Childhood from the Classical Past (Yale University Press, 2003), p. 145; Carl Kerenyi, Dionysos: Archetypal Image of Indestructable Life (Princeton University Press, 1976), p. 300. as did the Greeks themselves, connecting it to the blossoming grapevine.Walter Burkert, Homo Necans p. 214. In the 6th century AD, the Byzantine antiquarian Joannes Lydus related the festival name to Anthousa, which he said was the Greek equivalent of the Latin Flora.Lydus, De mensibus 4.73; Clifford Ando, \\"The Palladium and the Pentateuch: Towards a Sacred Topography of the Later Roman Empire,\\" Phoenix 55 (2001), p. 400. The three-day festival, which took place at the threshold between winter and spring, involved themes of liminality and \\"opening up\\", but despite its importance in early Athens, many aspects elude certainty. It was primarily a celebration of opening the new wine from the previous fall's vintage.Noel Robertson, \\"Athens' Festival of the New Wine,\\" Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 95 (1993), p. 197ff. Robertson argues that the Anthesteria was not a festival of the dead, and believes those elements have been attributed to it erroneously. On the first day, \\"Dionysus\\" entered borne by a wheeled \\"ship\\" in a public procession, and was taken to the private chamber of the king's wifeThe word for \\"king\\" is basileus, an indication that the ceremony evokes a time before Athens was a democracy; Seaford, Cosmology and the Polis, pp. 87–88. for a ritual union with her; the precise ceremonies are unknown, but may be related to the myth of Ariadne, who became the consort of Dionysus after she was abandoned by the Athenian culture hero Theseus.Seaford, Cosmology and the Polis, pp. 85–87, 101, 133, citing Apollodorus, Against Nature 73; Burkert, Greek Religion pp. 109, 164, 239. Child's ceremonial wine vessel (chous) for the Anthesteria, depicting Eros as a chubby boy who pulls a cart and extends his hand toward his own wreathed chous (ca. 410 BC) In keeping with its theme of new growth and transformation,Neils, \\"Children and Greek Religion,\\" in Coming of Age in Ancient Greece, p. 145. the Anthesteria was also the occasion for a rite of passage from infancy to childhood—a celebratory moment given the high rate of infant mortality in the ancient world. Children between the age of three and four received a small jug (chous) specially decorated with scenes of children playing at adult activities. The chous itself is sometimes depicted on the vessel, adorned with a wreath. The following year, the child was given a ceremonial taste of wine from his chous.Neils, \\"Children and Greek Religion,\\" p. 145; John H. Oakley, \\"Death and the Child,\\" p. 177; Lesley A. Beaumont, \\"The Changing Face of Childhood,\\" p. 75; and H.A. Shapiro, \\"Fathers and Sons, Men and Boys,\\" pp. 89, 103, all in Coming of Age in Ancient Greece. See also Burkert, Greek Religion, pp. 237–238. These vessels are often found in children's graves, accompanying them to the underworld after a premature death.Beaumont, \\"The Changing Face of Childhood,\\" p. 75; Oakley, \\"Death and the Child,\\" p. 177. The Anthesteria has also been compared with the Roman Lemuria,Burkert, Homo Necans, p. 226. with the second day a vulnerable time when the barrier between the world of the living and the dead became permeable, and the shades of the dead could wander the earth. On the third day, the ghosts were driven from the city, and Hermes Chthonios (\\"Underworld Hermes\\") received sacrifices in the form of pots of grains and seeds.Burkert, Greek Religion, pp. 218, 222. Although the identity of the shades is unclear, typically the restless dead are those who died prematurely.Kerenyi, Dionysos: Archetypal Image of Indestructable Life, p. 364. =Wine and roses= The priestess of Thessalonica who bequeathed a tract of vineyard for the maintenance of her memory required each Dionysian initiate who attended to wear a rose wreath. In a Dionysian context, wine, roses, and the color red are trappings of violence and funerals as well as amorous pursuits and revelry. Dionysus is described by Philostratus (d. ca. 250 AD) as wearing a wreath of roses and a red or purple cloak as he encounters Ariadne,Philostratus, Imagines 1.15; Terence Cave, Retrospectives: Essays in Literature, Poetics and Cultural History (Modern Humanities Research Association, 2009), p. 73. whose sleep is a kind of death from which she is awakened and transformed by the god's love.Susan Guettel Cole, \\"Finding Dionysus,\\" in A Companion to Greek Religion p. 333; Nina da Vinci Nichols, Ariadne's Lives (Associated University Presses, 1995), p. 14 et passim; Zahra Newby, \\"In the Guise of Gods and Heroes: Portrait Heads on Roman Mythological Sarcophagi,\\" in Life, Death and Representation: Some New Work on Roman Sarcophagi (Walter de Gruyter, 2011), pp. 201–205. mosaic The crown that symbolized Ariadne's immortal union with Dionysus underwent metamorphosis into a constellation, the Corona Borealis; in some sources, the corona was a diadem of jewels, but for the Roman dramatist SenecaSeneca, Phaedra 769, as noted by Michael Coffey and Roland Mayer, Seneca: Phaedra (Cambridge University Press, 1990), pp. 159–160; and Hercules Furens 18, as noted by John G. Fitch, Seneca's Hercules Furens: A Critical Text with Introduction and Commentary (Cornell University Press, 1987), pp. 125–126. and others it was a garland of roses. In the Astronomica of Manilius (1st century AD), Ariadne's crown is bejeweled with purple and red flowers—violets, hyacinths, poppies, and \\"the flower of the blooming rose, made red by blood\\"—and exerts a positive astrological influence on cultivating flower gardens, weaving garlands, and distilling perfume.Manilius, Astronomica 251–269 (edition of Houseman), as noted by Michael Murrin, \\"Renaissance Allegory from Petrarch to Spenser,\\" in The Cambridge Companion to Allegory (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 172, with reference to the influence of the passage on Edmund Spenser, Faerie Queene 6.10.14. Dionysian scenes were common on Roman sarcophagi, and the persistence of love in the face of death may be embodied by attendant Cupids or Erotes.Janet Huskinson, Roman Children's Sarcophagi: Their Decoration and Its Social Significance (Oxford University Press, 1996), p. 30; Paul Zanker and Björn C. Ewald, Living with Myths: The Imagery of Roman Sarcophagi (Oxford University Press, 2012), p. 102 et passim; Newby, \\"In the Guise of Gods and Heroes,\\" pp. 201–205. In Vergil's Aeneid, purple flowers are strewn with the pouring of Bacchic libations during the funeral rites the hero Aeneas conducts for his dead father.Vergil, Aeneid 5.77–81; Brenk, Clothed in Purple Light, p. 88. In the Dionysiaca of Nonnus (late 4th–early 5th century AD), Dionysus mourns the death of the beautiful youth Ampelos by covering the body with flowers—roses, lilies, anemones—and infusing it with ambrosia. The dead boy's metamorphosis creates the first grapevine, which in turn produces the transformative substance of wine for human use.Nonnus, Dionysiaca 11.241–243; Miguélez-Cavero, Poems in Context, p. 132. Rites of Adonis \\"The blood of the dead Adonis turns into an anemone\\" (Ovid, Met. X 735) (1609), by Hendrick Goltzius The rites of Adonis (Adoneia) also came to be regarded as a Rosalia in the Imperial era.Dominic Perring, \\"'Gnosticism' in Fourth-Century Britain: The Frampton Mosaics Reconsidered,\\" Britannia 34 (2003), p. 108. In one version of the myth, blood from Aphrodite's foot, pricked by a thorn, dyes the flowers produced from the body of Adonis when he is killed by the boar.Rina Talgam, \\"The Ekphrasis Eikonos of Procopius of Gaza: The Depiction of Mythological Themes in Palestine and Arabia during the Fifth and Sixth Centuries,\\" in Christian Gaza in Late Antiquity (Brill, 2004), pp. 223–224. In the Lament for Adonis attributed to Bion (2nd century BC), the tears of Aphrodite match the blood shed by Adonis drop by drop, > and the blood and tears become flowers upon the ground. Of the blood comes > the rose, and of the tears the windflower.Brenk, Clothed in Purple Light, p. > 87; translation by J.M. Edmonds at theoi.com. Pausanias (6.24.7) also > connects roses to the story of Aphrodite and Adonis; Cyprino, Aphrodite, p. > 96. According to myth, Adonis was born from the incestuous union of Myrrha and her father. The delusional lust was a punishment from Aphrodite, whom Myrrha had slighted. The girl deceived her father with darkness and a disguise, but when he learned who she really was, his rage transformed her human identity and she became the fragrance-producing myrrh tree. The vegetative nature of Adonis is expressed in his birth from the tree. In one tradition, Aphrodite took the infant, hid him in a box (larnax, a word often referring to chests for ash or other human remains), and gave him to the underworld goddess Persephone to nurture. When he grew into a beautiful youth, both Aphrodite and Persephone—representing the realms of love and death—claimed him. Zeus decreed that Adonis would spend a third of the year with the heavenly Aphrodite, a third with chthonic Persephone, and a third on the mortal plane. The theme is similar to Persephone's own year divided between her underworld husband and the world above.Gina Salapata, \\"Τριφίλητος Ἄδωνις: An Exceptional Pair of Terra-cotta Arulae from South Italy,\\" in Studia Varia from the J. Paul Getty Museum (Getty Publications, 2001), vol. 2, p. 34; J.P. Massaut, \\"Mystique rhénane et humanisme chrétien d'Eckhart à Érasme. Continuité, convergence ou rupture?\\" in The Late Middle Ages and the Dawn of Humanism Outside Italy (Leuven University Press, 1972), p. 128, citing as an example Ausonius, Epistolarum liber 4.49. For J.G. Frazer, Adonis was an archetypal vegetative god, and H.J. Rose saw in the rites of Adonis \\"the outlines of an Oriental myth of the Great Mother and of her lover who dies as the vegetation dies, but comes back to life again.\\"H.J. Rose, A Handbook to Greek Mythology (Routledge, 1928, 6th ed. 1958, 1964 paperback edition), p. 101. Robert A. Segal analyzed the death of Adonis as the failure of the \\"eternal child\\" (puer) to complete his rite of passage into the adult life of the city-state, and thus as a cautionary tale involving the social violations of \\"incest, murder, license, possessiveness, celibacy, and childlessness\\".Robert A. Segal, \\"Adonis: A Greek Eternal Child,\\" in Myth and the Polis (Cornell University Press, 1991), pp. 64–85. Dying Adonis attended by hound, on a funerary monument with floral motifs on its corner feet (latter 3rd century BC) Women performed the Adoneia with ceremonial lamentation and dirges, sometimes in the presence of an effigy of the dead youth that might be placed on a couch, perfumed, and adorned with greenery.Salapata, \\"Τριφίλητος Ἄδωνις,\\" p. 35. As part of the festival, they planted \\"gardens of Adonis\\", container-grown annuals from \\"seeds planted in shallow soil, which sprang up quickly and withered quickly\\",Rose, A Handbook to Greek Mythology, p. 101. compressing the cycle of life and death. The festival, often nocturnal, was not a part of the official state calendar of holidays, and as a private rite seems like the Rosalia to have had no fixed date.Salapata, \\"Τριφίλητος Ἄδωνις,\\" p. 34. Although the celebration varied from place to place, it generally had two phases: joyful revelry like a marriage feast in celebration of the love between Aphrodite and Adonis, and ritual mourning for his death. Decorations and ritual trappings for the feast, including the dish gardens, were transformed for the funeral or destroyed as offerings: the garlanded couch became the lying-in bier (prothesis).Salapata, \\"Τριφίλητος Ἄδωνις,\\" pp. 35–36. The iconography of Aphrodite and Adonis as a couple is often hard to distinguish in Greek art from that of Dionysus and Ariadne.Salapata, \\"Τριφίλητος Ἄδωνις,\\" p. 36. In contrast to Greek depictions of the couple enjoying the luxury and delight of love, Roman paintings and sarcophagi almost always frame their love at the moment of loss, with the death of Adonis in Aphrodite's arms posing the question of resurrection.Salapata, \\"Τριφίλητος Ἄδωνις,\\" pp. 38 and 48 (note 138). At Madaba, an Imperial city of the Province of Arabia in present-day Jordan, a series of mythological mosaics has a scene of Aphrodite and Adonis enthroned, attended by six Erotes and three Charites (\\"Graces\\"). A basket of overturned roses near them has been seen as referring to the Rosalia.Talgam, \\"The Ekphrasis Eikonos of Procopius,\\" p. 223. In late antiquity, literary works set at a Rosalia—whether intended for performance at the actual occasion, or only using the occasion as a fictional setting—take the \\"lament for Adonis\\" as their theme.Talgam, \\"The Ekphrasis Eikonos of Procopius,\\" p. 223; David Westberg, \\"The Rite of Spring: Erotic Celebration in the Dialexis and Ethiopoiiai of Procopius of Gaza,\\" in Plotting With Eros: Essays on the Poetics of Love and the Erotics of Reading (Museum Tusculanum Press, 2009), p. 189. Shared language for the Roman festival of Rosalia and the floral aspects of the Adoneia may indicate similar or comparable practices, and not necessarily direct assimilation.Westberg, \\"The Rite of Spring,\\" in Plotting with Eros, p. 189. The violets of Attis Reclining Attis with radiate crown, holding a shepherd's crook (damaged) in his left hand and in his right pomegranates, pine cones, and wheat: his partial nudity shows that he has undergone complete castration, and the bearded head on which he leans is most likely the river god SangariusMaria Grazia Lancellotti, Attis, Between Myth and History: King, Priest, and God (Brill, 2002), p.116. or GallusJaime Alvar, Romanising Oriental Gods: Myth, Salvation and Ethics in the Cults of Cybele, Isis and Mithras, translated by Richard Gordon (Brill, 2008), p. 38. (from Ostia, 2nd century AD) From the reign of Claudius to that of Antoninus Pius, a \\"holy week\\" in March developed for ceremonies of the Magna Mater (\\"Great Mother\\", also known as Mater Deum, \\"Mother of the Gods,\\" or Cybele) and Attis.Lancellotti, Attis, p. 81; Bertrand Lançon, Rome in Late Antiquity (Routledge, 2001), p. 91; Philippe Borgeaud, Mother of the Gods: From Cybele to the Virgin Mary, translated by Lysa Hochroth (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2004), pp. 51, 90, 123, 164. Scholars are divided as to whether the full program of observances was put in place under Claudius, or gradually expanded until the time of Antoninus Pius: Gary Forsythe, Time in Roman Religion: One Thousand Years of Religious History (Routledge, 2012), p. 88; Alvar, Romanising Oriental Gods, p. 286. A preliminary festival on March 15 marked the discovery by shepherds or Cybele of the infant Attis among the reeds of a Phrygian river. The continuous ceremonies recommenced March 22 with the Arbor intrat (\\"The Tree enters\\") and lasted through March 27 or 28. For the day of Arbor intrat, the college of dendrophores (\\"tree-bearers\\") carried a pine tree to which was bound an effigy of Attis, wrapped in \\"woollen bandages like a corpse\\" and ornamented with violet wreaths.Francisco R. Adrados, Festival, Comedy and Tragedy: The Greek Origins of Theatre, translated by Christopher Holme (Brill, 1975, originally published 1972 in Spanish), p. 395. Lucretius (1st century BC) mentions roses and other unnamed flowers in the ecstatic procession of the Magna Mater for the Megalensia in April.Lucretius, De rerum natura 2.627–628.; Hooey, \\"Rosaliae signorum,\\" p. 27. The most vivid and complex accountAlvar, Romanising Oriental Gods, p. 65; Gasparao, Soteriology, p. 41. of how the violet was created out of violence in the Attis myth is given by the Christian apologist Arnobius (d. ca. 330),Arnobius of Sicca, Adversus Nationes 6–7, drawing on sources he identifies as \\"Timotheus, a man not disreputable in matters of theology,\\" and \\"Valerius the pontifex\\", possibly Marcus Valerius Messala, the consul of 53 BC and author of a treatise identifying Aion with Janus on the etymological basis of Ia, the name \\"Violet\\" in the story of Attis. Summary based on that of Lancelotti, Attis, pp. 3–5; Alvar, Romanising Oriental Gods, pp. 65–67; and Giulia Sfameni Gasparro (combining the versions of Arnobius and Pausanias), Soteriology and Mystic Aspects in the Cult of Cybele and Attis (Brill, 1985), pp. 38–41. whose version best reflects cult practice in the Roman Imperial period.Alvar, Romanising Oriental Gods, p. 64. The story begins with a rock in Phrygia named Agdus, from which had come the stones transformed to humans by Pyrrha and Deucalion to repopulate the world after the Flood. The Great Mother of the Gods customarily rested there, and there she was assailed by the lustful Jupiter. Unable to achieve his aim, the king of gods relieved himself by masturbating on the rock,Alvar, Romanising Oriental Gods, p. 65. from which was born Acdestis or Agdistis, a violent and supremely powerful hermaphroditic deity. After deliberations, the gods assign the cura of this audacity to Liber, the Roman god identified with Dionysus: cura means variously \\"care, concern, cure, oversight.\\" Liber sets a snare, replacing the waters of Agdistis's favorite spring (fons) with pure wine. Necessity in time drives the thirsty Agdistis to drink, veins sucking up the torpor-inducing liquid. The trap is sprung: a noose, woven from hair, suspends Agdistis by the genitals, and the struggle to break free causes a self-castration. From the blood springs a pomegranate tree, its fruit so enticing that Nana, the daughter of the river god Sangarius, in sinu reponit, a euphemism in Imperial-era medical and Christian writing for \\"placed within the vagina\\".J.N. Adams, entry on sinus (muliebris), The Latin Sexual Vocabulary (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1982), pp. 90–91. In Pausanias, the impregnating edible is an almond, with the almond tree playing a role later in the version of Arnobius; Gasparro, Soteriology, p. 38. Nana becomes pregnant, enraging her father. He locks her away as damaged goods, and starves her. She is kept alive by fruits and other vegetarian food provided by the Mother of the Gods. When the infant is born, Sangarius orders that it be exposed, but it is discovered and reared by a goatherd. This child is Attis. Ionian Dancing Girl (1902) by John William Godward, a companion to the same violet-wreathed figure in With Violets Wreathed and Robe of Saffron Hue, an example of classicizing myth in Victorian paintingVern G. Swanson, John William Godward: The Eclipse of Classicism (Antique Collectors Club Limited, 1997), p. 65; Rosemary J. Barrow, The Use of Classical Art and Literature by Victorian Painters, 1860-1912: Creating Continuity With the Traditions of High Art (Mellen Research University Press, 2007), p. 39. The exceptionally beautiful Attis grows up favored by the Mother of the Gods and by Agdistis, who is his constant companion. Under the influence of wine, Attis reveals that his accomplishments as a hunter are owing to divine favor—an explanation for why wine is religiously prohibited (nefas) in his sanctuary and considered a pollution for those who would enter. Attis's relationship with Agdistis is characterized as infamis, disreputable and socially marginalizing. The Phrygian king Midas, wishing to redeem the boy (puer), arranges a marriage with his daughter, and locks down the city. The Mater Deum, however, know Attis's fate (fatum): that he will be preserved from harm only if he avoids the bonds of marriage. Both the Mother of the Gods and Agdistis crash the party, and Agdistis spreads frenzy and madness among the convivial guests. In a detail that appears only in a vexed passage in the Christian source,Gasparro, Soteriology, pp. 39–40, characterizing the detail as \\"a polemical emphasis\\". the daughter of a concubine to a man named Gallus cuts off her breasts. Raging like a bacchant, Attis then throws himself under a pine tree, and cuts off his genitals as an offering to Agdistis. He bleeds to death, and from the flux of blood is born a violet flower. The Mother of the Gods wraps the genitals \\"in the garment of the dead\\" and covers them with earth, an aspect of the myth attested in ritual by inscriptions regarding the sacrificial treatment of animal scrota.Alvar, Romanising Oriental Gods, p. 275. The would-be bride, whose name is Violet (Greek Ia), covers Attis's chest with woollen bands, and after mourning with Agdistis kills herself. Her dying blood is changed into purple violets. The tears of the Mother of the Gods become an almond tree, which signifies the bitterness of death. She then takes the pine tree to her sacred cave, and Agdistis joins her in mourning, begging Jupiter to restore Attis to life. This he cannot permit; but fate allows the body to never decay, the hair to keep growing, and the little finger to live and to wave in perpetual motion. Arnobius explicitly states that the rituals performed in honor of Attis in his day reenact aspects of the myth as he has told it, much of which developed only in the Imperial period, in particular the conflict and intersections with Dionysian cult.Lancellotti, Attis, pp. 89–90, 138ff. et passim; Jan N. Bremmer, Greek Religion and Culture, the Bible, and the Near East (Brill, 2008), pp. 294–296, 298. For the Arbor intrat on March 22, the dendrophores carried the violet-wreathed tree of Attis to the Temple of the Magna Mater. As a dies violae, the day of Arbor intrat recalled the scattering of violets onto graves for the Parentalia.Ovid, Fasti 2.537–540; Lancellotti, Attis, pp. 90–91; Gasparro, Soteriology, p. 42. Lancellotti emphasizes the non-cyclical permanence of Attis's death (p. 138) marked by rituals that recall funeral cult. The next day the dendrophores laid the tree to rest with noisy music that represented the Corybantes, youths who performed armed dances and in mythology served as guardians for infant gods.Michele Renee Salzman, On Roman Time: The Codex Calendar of 354 and the Rhythms of Urban Life in Late Antiquity (University of California Press, 1990), pp. 166–167. For the Dies Sanguinis (\\"Day of Blood\\") on March 24, the devotees lacerated themselves in a frenzy of mourning, spattering the effigy with the blood craved as \\"nourishment\\" by the dead. Some followers may have castrated themselves on this day, as a preliminary to becoming galli, the eunuch priests of Cybele. Attis was placed in his \\"tomb\\" for the Sacred Night that followed.Salzman, On Roman Time, p. 167; Lancellotti, Attis, pp. 82 and 90. According to Sallustius, the cutting of the tree was accompanied by fasting, \\"as though we were cutting off the further progress of generation; after this we are fed on milk as though being reborn; that is followed by rejoicings and garlands and as it were a new ascent to the gods.\\"Sallustius, Peri Theōn 4.10, as cited by Alvar, Romanising Oriental Gods, p. 277. The garlands and rejoicing (Hilaria) occurred on March 25, the vernal equinox on the Julian calendar, when Attis was in some sense \\"reborn\\" or renewed.Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.21.10; Forsythe, Time in Roman Religion, p. 88. Some early Christian sources associate this day with the resurrection of Jesus,Tertullian, Adversus Iudaeos 8; Lactantius, De Mortibus Persecutorum 2.1; Forsythe, Time in Roman Religion, p. 88; Salzman, On Roman Time, p. 168. and Damascius saw it as a \\"liberation from Hades\\".Damascius, Vita Isidori excerpta a Photio Bibl. (Cod. 242), edition of R. Henry (Paris, 1971), p. 131; Salzman, On Roman Time, p. 168. After a day of rest (Requietio), the ritual cleansing (Lavatio) of the Magna Mater was carried out on March 27.Alvar, Romanising Oriental Gods, pp. 277, 286–287. The Lavatio is mentioned by Ovid in the Augustan period, and other literary references indicate it was \\"well established\\" by the Flavian period; Forsythe, Time in Roman Religion, p. 89. March 28 may have been a day of initiation into the mysteries of the Magna Mater and Attis at the Vaticanum.Specifically at the Gaianum, near the Phrygianum sanctuary associated with Cybele; Salzman, On Roman Time, pp. 165, 167. Lawrence Richardson, A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), p. 180, suggests that Initium Caiani might instead refer to the \\"entry of Gaius\\" (Caligula) into Rome on March 28, 37 AD, when he was acclaimed as princeps. The Gaianum was a track used by Caligula for chariot exercises. Salzman (p. 169) sees the Gaianum as a site alternative to the Phrygianum, access to which would have been obstructed in the 4th century by the construction of St. Peter's. Although scholars have become less inclined to view Attis within the rigid schema of \\"dying and rising vegetation god\\", the vegetal cycle remains integral to the funerary nature of his rites.Gasparro, Soteriology, pp. 44–45; H.S. Versnel, Inconsistencies in Greek and Roman Religion: Transition and Reversal in Myth and Ritual (Brill, 1993, 1994), vol. 2, p. 154. The pine tree and pine cones were introduced to the iconography of Attis for their cult significance during the Roman period.Bremmer, Greek Religion and Culture, pp. 279 and 288, suggesting also that the tree of the Romans was not entirely an innovation, but a survival or translation of the decorated tree, perhaps an almond, that was part of the Hittite new year festival in the spring. A late 1st- or 2nd- century statue of Attis from Athens has him with a basket containing pomegranates, pine cones, and a nosegay of violets.Gasparro, Soteriology, p. 48. Vegetal aspects of spring festivals Perceived connections with older spring festivals that involved roses helped spread and popularize the Rosalia, and the private dies violae or violaris of the Romans was enhanced by the public prominence of Arbor intrat ceremonies.Hooey, \\"Rosaliae signorum,\\" p. 27. The conceptual link between Attis and Adonis was developed primarily in the later Imperial period.Bremmer, Greek Religion and Culture, p. 270, emphasizing the disparities between the early cult of Attis and developments in Late Antiquity (p. 268). The Neoplatonic philosopher Porphyry (d. ca. 305 AD) saw both Adonis and Attis as aspects of the \\"fruits of the earth\\": Waterhouse > Attis is the symbol of the blossoms which appear early in the spring, and > fall off before the complete fertilization; whence they further attributed > castration to him, from the fruits not having attained to seminal > perfection: but Adonis was the symbol of the cutting of the perfect > fruits.As recorded by the Christian apologist Eusebius, Praeparatio > evangelica 3.11.12 and 15, and 3.13.14, translated by E.H. Gifford (1903), > as cited by Gasparro, Soteriology, p. 46. In a commentary on Ovid, and > citing Porphyry and Eusebius, the 15th-century Italian humanist Paulus > Marsus noted that \\"Atys castrated means nothing other than the flower that > falls before the fruit\\"; Rebecca Zorach, Blood, Milk, Ink, Gold: Abundance > and Excess in the French Renaissance (University of Chicago Press, 2005), p. > 72. Porphyry linked Attis, Adonis, Korē (Persephone as \\"the Maiden\\", influencing \\"dry\\" or grain crops), and Dionysus (who influences soft and shell fruits) as deities of \\"seminal law\\": > For Korē was carried off by Pluto, that is, the sun going down beneath the > earth at seed-time; but Dionysus begins to sprout according to the > conditions of the power which, while young, is hidden beneath the earth, yet > produces fine fruits, and is an ally of the power in the blossom symbolized > by Attis, and of the cutting of the ripened corn symbolized by Adonis. Roses and violets are typically among the flower species that populate the meadow from which Persephone was abducted as Pluto's bride.Cohen, \\"Mythic Landscapes of Greece,\\" in The Cambridge Companion to Greek Mythology, p. 316, citing the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, one of the earliest treatments of the myth. Ovid places Proserpina among violets and lilies at Metamorphoses 5.332, and dwells on the abundance and variety of flowers—with the rose the favored choice of the attendant nymphs—in his treatment of the same myth for the month of April at Fasti 4.429–442. Claudian, De raptu Proserpina 2.92–93, lists roses, hyacinths and violets. The comparative mythologist Mircea Eliade saw divine metamorphosis as a \\"flowing of life\\" between vegetal and human existence. When violent death interrupts the creative potential of life, it is expressed \\"in some other form: plant, fruit, flower\\". Eliade related the violets of Attis and the roses and anemones of Adonis to legends of flowers appearing on battlefields after the deaths of heroes.Mircea Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Religion, translated by Rosemary Sheed (University of Nebraska Press, 1996, translation originally published in 1958), p. 302. Military Rosaliae The Eagle of a military standard on a Roman soldier's funerary monument (1st–2nd century AD) The Roman army celebrated the Rosaliae signorum, when the military standards (signa) were adorned with roses in a supplication, on two dates in May. A.H. Hooey viewed the military rose festival as incorporating traditional spring festivals of vegetative deities.Hooey, \\"Rosaliae signorum,\\" pp. 27–28. The festival is noted in the Feriale Duranum, a papyrus calendar for a cohort stationed at Dura-Europos during the reign of Severus Alexander (224–235 AD). The calendar is thought to represent a standard religious calendar issued to the military.Lucinda Dirven, The Palmyrenes of Dura-Europos: A Study of Religious Interaction in Roman Syria (Brill, 1999), pp. 184–185; Nigel Pollard, Soldiers, Cities, and Civilians in Roman Syria (University of Michigan Press, 2000), pp. 143 (especially note 126), 146. The day of the earlier of the two Rosaliae is uncertain because of the fragmentary text, but coincided with the period of the Lemuria, archaic festival days on May 9, 11, and 13Duncan Fishwick, \\"Dated Inscriptions and the Feriale Duranum,\\" in Syria 65 (1988), p. 356; Douglas W. Geyer, Fear, Anomaly, and Uncertainty in the Gospel of Mark (Scarecrow Press, 2002), p. 138, citing R.O. Fink, A.S. Hooey, and W.S. Snyder, \\"The Feriale Duranum,\\" Yale Classical Studies 7 (1940), p. 115. Stefan Weinstock, \\"A New Greek Calendar and Festivals of the Sun,\\" Journal of Roman Studies 38 (1948), p. 38, gives the date as May 10. Steven K. Drummond and Lynn H. Nelson, The Western Frontiers of the Imperial Rome (M.E. Sharpe, 1994), p. 203, place it on May 9. for propitiating shades (lemures or larvae) of those whose untimely death left them wandering the earth instead of passing into the underworld. The ceremonies of the Lemuria, in the vivid description of Ovid, featured the spitting of black beans as an especially potent apotropaic gesture.Michael Lipka, Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach (Brill, 2009), p. 43. The second of the Rosaliae signorum occurred on May 31, the day before the Kalends of June.Phillips, Oxford Classical Dictionary, quotes the calendar as pridie kal. Iunias ob rosalias signorum supplicatio; that is, as occurring on the day before the Kalends of June. The feast day of June 1, devoted to the tenebrous Dea Carna (\\"Flesh Goddess\\" or \\"Food Goddess\\") and commonly called the \\"Bean Kalends\\" (Kalendae Fabariae),Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.12.33. may have pertained to rites of the deadIn the conjecture of Wissowa; William Warde Fowler, The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic (London, 1908), p 131. Fowler is cautious about over-interpreting the evidence to characterize all these occasions as \\"rites of the dead\\". and like the days of the Lemuria was marked on the calendar as nefastus, a time when normal activities were religiously prohibited. In the later Empire, the Rosaliae signorum coincided with the third day of the \\"Bean Games\\" (Ludi Fabarici) held May 29–June 1, presumably in honor of Carna.Salzman, On Roman Time, pp. 92, 122, 127; Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.12.33. A civilian inscription records a bequest for rose- adornment \\"on the Carnaria\\", interpreted by Mommsen as Carna's Kalends.CIL 3.3893; Fowler, Roman Festivals, p. 131. Sculpture from a 3rd-century military headquarters at Coria, in Roman Britain (Corbridge, Northumberland), has been interpreted as representing the Rosaliae.Fishwick, \\"Dated Inscriptions and the Feriale Duranum,\\" pp. 351–352. A 3rd-century inscription from Mogontiacum (present-day Mainz), in the province of Germania Superior, records the dedication of an altar to the Genius of the military unit (a centuria), on May 10. Although the inscription does not name the Rosaliae, the date of the dedication, made in connection with Imperial cult, may have been chosen to coincide with it.CIL 13.6681; Fishwick, \\"Dated Inscriptions and the Feriale Duranum,\\" p. 356. lustral sacrifice, on a relief panel from Trajan's Column; under the tree are military trumpeters playing tubae and cornua The Rosaliae signorum were part of devotional practices characteristic of the army surrounding the military standards. The Imperial historian Tacitus says that the army venerated the standards as if they were gods, and inscriptions record dedications (vota) made on their behalf.CIL 7.1030 is an example of such a dedication from Roman Britain: Drummond and Nelson, The Western Frontiers of Imperial Rome, p. 214; G.R. Watson, The Roman Soldier (Cornell University Press, 1969, 1985), p. 130. The day on which a legion marked the anniversary of its formation was the natalis aquilae, \\"the Eagle's birthday,\\" in reference to the Roman eagle of the standard.Hooey, \\"Rosaliae signorum,\\" p. 19; Pat Southern, The Roman Army: A Social and Institutional History (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 161; Brian Campbell, The Roman Army, 31 BC–AD 337: A Sourcebook (Routledge, 1994), n.p. All Roman military camps, including marching camps, were constructed around a central altar where daily sacrifices were made, surrounded by the standards planted firmly into the groundHooey, \\"Rosaliae signorum,\\" p. 17; Graham Webster, The Roman Imperial Army: Of the First and Second Centuries A.D. (University of Oklahoma Press, 1979, 3rd ed. 1998), p. 133. and by images of emperors and gods.Allen Brent, Cyprian and Roman Carthage (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 182. Decorated units displayed gold and silver wreaths on their standards that represented the bestowal of living wreaths, and the Eagles and other signa were garlanded and anointed for lustrations, ceremonies for beginning a campaign, victories, crisis rituals, and Imperial holidays.Pliny, Natural History 13.3.23; Suetonius, Claudius 13; Hooey, \\"Rosaliae signorum,\\" pp. 17–19; Webster, The Roman Imperial Army, pp. 106 (note 16) and 133. Among these occasions was the wedding of the emperor Honorius in 398 AD, described in an epithalamium by Claudian: the military standards are said to grow red with flowers, and the standard-bearers and soldiers ritually shower the imperial bridegroom with flowers purpureoque ... nimbo, in a purple halo.Hooey, \\"Rosaliae signorum,\\" pp. 18 and 32, citing Claudian 10.187–188 and 295–297. In recounting a mutiny against Claudius in 42 AD, Suetonius avers that divine agency prevented the Eagles from being adorned or pulled from the earth to break camp by the legionaries who had violated their oath (sacramentum); reminded of their religious obligation, they were turned toward repentance (in paenitentiam religione conversis).Webster, The Roman Imperial Army, p. 106, citing Suetonius, Claudius 13. Christian apologists saw the veneration of the signa as central to the religious life of the Roman military, and Minucius Felix tried to demonstrate that because of the cruciform shape, the soldiers had been worshipping the Christian cross without being aware of it.Hooey, \\"Rosaliae signorum,\\" p. 16, especially note 3, citing Tertullian Apologeticum 16 and Ad nationes 1.12, and Minucius Felix 29.6–7; p. 206 Most evidence of the Rosalia from the Empire of the 1st–3rd centuries points toward festivals of the dead. Soldiers commemorated fallen comrades,Hooey, \\"Rosaliae signorum,\\" pp. 23–25. and might swear an oath on the manes (deified spirits) of dead brothers-in-arms.Silius Italicus, Punica 6.113–116; Charles W. King, \\"The Roman Manes: The Dead as Gods,\\" in Rethinking Ghosts in World Religions (Brill, 2009), p. 112. Hooey, however, argued against interpreting the Rosaliae signorum as a kind of \\"poppy day\\". Roman rose festivals, in his view, were of two distinct and mutually exclusive kinds: the celebratory and licentious festivals of spring, and the somber cult of the dead. Transferred from the civilian realm, the old festivals of vegetative deities were celebrated in the Eastern Empire in a spirit of indulgence and luxury that was uniquely out of keeping with the public and Imperial character of other holidays on the Feriale Duranum.Hooey, \\"Rosaliae signorum,\\" pp. 23–26, 32–35. Webster, The Roman Imperial Army, p. 150, accepts Hooey's \\"carnival\\" interpretation. This \\"carnival\\" view of the Rosaliae signorum was rejected by William Seston, who saw the May festivals as celebratory lustrations after the first battles of the military campaigning season, coordinate with the Tubilustrium that fell on May 23 between the two rose-adornments.William Seston, \\"Feldzeichen,\\" in Scripta Varia. Mélanges d'histoire romaine, de droit, d'épigraphie et d'histoire du christianisme (Publications de l'École française de Rome, 1980), p. 273. Corybantes accompanying Cybele and Attis (detail from the Parabiago plate; embossed silver, ca. 200–400 AD, found in a tomb near Milan, now at the Archaeological Museum of Milan) The Tubilustrium was itself a purification ritual. Attested on calendars for both March 23 and May 23, it was perhaps originally monthly. The lustration (lustrum) was performed regarding the annunciatory trumpets (tubi or tubae, a long straight trumpet, and cornua, which curved around the body) that were used to punctuate sacral games and ceremonies, funerals,Jörg Rüpke, The Roman Calendar from Numa to Constantine: Time, History, and the Fasti, translated by David M.B. Richardson (Wiley-Blackwell, 2011, originally published in German 1995), pp. 28–29; Pat Southern, The Roman Army: A Social and Institutional History (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 159. and for signals and timekeeping in the military.Southern, The Roman Army, p. 159; Yann Le Bohec, The Imperial Roman Army (Routledge, 2001, originally published 1989 in French), p. 50; Webster, The Roman Imperial Army, p. 140. The March 23 Tubilustrium coincided in the city of Rome with a procession of Mars' armed priests the Salii, who clanged their sacred shields. In the later Empire, it had become assimilated into the \\"holy week\\" of Attis, occurring on the day when the tree rested at the Temple of the Magna Mater. As a pivotal point in the cycle of death/chaos and (re)birth/order, the day brought together noise rituals of wind and percussion instruments from different traditions, the clamor of the Corybantes or Kouretes who attended Cybele and Attis, and Roman ceremonies of apotropaic trumpet blasts or the beating of shields by the Salian priests,Salzman, On Roman Time,, pp. 166–167. Alvar, Romanising Oriental Gods, p. 73, cites Julian, Oratio 5.169c, on the sounding of trumpets after the castration of Attis. who were theologically identified with the Kouretes as early as the 1st century BC.The Salii identified with the Kouretes by Dionysius of Halicarnassus 2.70–71 (see also Catullus 63, who attributes the tripudium dance of the Salii to the ecstatic followers of Cybele and Attis); Bremmer, Greek Religion and Culture, p. 296. Tacitus records the performance of noise rituals on the trumpets by the military in conjunction with a lunar eclipse.Tacitus, Annales 1.28; Southern, The Roman Army, p. 159; Rüpke, The Roman Calendar, p. 28, especially note 44. The practice is found in other sources in a civilian context.Rüpke, The Roman Calendar, p. 28, citing Juvenal 6.442–443 and Livy 26.5.9. Jörg Rüpke conjectures that the tubae were played monthly \\"to fortify the waning moon (Luna)\\", one nundinal cycle after the full moon of the Ides, since the Roman calendar was originally lunar.Rüpke, The Roman Calendar, p. 28. Rüpke argues that the Tubilustrium continued to be monthly, with the likely exception of February—a month already largely consumed with the care of the dead—but in other months its spot on calendars was overwritten by festivals that doubled up on the date. The signa and the trumpets were closely related in Roman military culture, both ceremonially and functionally, and on Trajan's Column the trumpets are shown pointing toward the standards during lustrations.Webster, The Roman Imperial Army, p. 134. Although Latin lustratio is usually translated as \\"purification\\", lustral ceremonies should perhaps be regarded as realignments and restorations of good order: \\"lustration is another word for maintaining, creating or restoring boundary lines between the centric order and the ex-centric disorder\\".Versnel, Inconsistencies in Greek and Roman Religion, pp. 311–312, 321; Jörg Rüpke, Domi Militiae: Die Religiöse Konstruktion des Krieges in Rom (Franz Steiner, 1990), pp. 144–146. The Rosaliae of the standards in May were contingent on supplicationes, a broad category of propitiatory ritual that realigned the community, in this case the army, with the pax deorum, the \\"treaty\\" or peace of the gods, by means of a procession, public prayers, and offerings. The military calendar represented by the Feriale Duranum prescribed supplicationes also for March 19–23, the period that began with the Quinquatria, an ancient festival of Minerva and Mars, and concluded with a Tubilustrium. The Crisis of the Third Century prompted a revival and expansion of the archaic practice of supplicatio in connection with military and Imperial cult.Brent, Cyprian and Roman Carthage, pp. 144, 149, 172–174, 182–183, 188, 191–197, 218–219, 227, 244, 248 (describing the principles of imperial supplicationes in regard to the universal supplicatio of Decius and the pax deorum). On the calendar Illustration of the month of May based on the Calendar of Filocalus (354 AD), which places the Rosalia on May 23Salzman, On Roman Time, p. 112. In the later Empire, rose festivals became part of the iconography for the month of May. The date would vary locally to accommodate the blooming season.Salzman, On Roman Time p. 98. For month allegories in mosaics, May is often represented with floral wreaths, the fillets or ribbons worn for sacrifice, and wine amphorae.Salzman, On Roman Time p. 97. May (Latin Maius) began in the middle of the Ludi Florae, a series of games in honor of the goddess Flora that opened April 28 of the Julian calendar and concluded May 3. Flora was a goddess of flowers and blooming, and her festivities were enjoyed with a notable degree of sexual liberty. In the 2nd century AD, Philostratus connects rose garlands with Flora's festival.Hooey, \\"Rosaliae signorum,\\" p. 27, citing Philostratus, Epigram 55. A Greek epigram from the Palatine Anthology has May personified announce \\"I am the mother of roses\\".Anthologia Palatina 9.580.4, as cited by Hooey, \\"Rosaliae signorum,\\" p. 27: εἰμὶ ῥόδων γενέτης (eimi rhodōn genetēs). Among explanations for the month's name was that it derived from Maia, a goddess of growth or increase whose own name was sometimes said to come from the adjective maius, \\"greater\\". Maia was honored in May with her son Mercury (Greek Hermes), a god of boundaries and commerce, and a conductor of souls to the afterlife. The theological identity of Maia was capacious; she was variously identified with goddesses such as Terra Mater (\\"Mother Earth\\"), the Good Goddess (Bona Dea), the Great Mother Goddess (Magna Mater, a title also for Cybele), Ops (\\"Abundance, Resources\\"), and Carna, the goddess of the Bean Kalends on June 1.H.H.J. Brouwer, Bona Dea: The Sources and a Description of the Cult (Brill, 1989), pp. 232, 354; Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.12.16–33. These identifications probably reflect the influence of Varro, who tended to see a great number of goddesses as ultimately representing Terra. Roses were distributed to the Arval Brothers, an archaic priesthood of Rome, after their banquets for the May festival of Dea Dia.Hooey, \\"Rosaliae signorum,\\" p. 27, note 57, citing the Acta Fratrum Arvalium. Waterhouse Although the month opened with the revelry of Flora, in mid-May the Romans observed the three-day Lemuria for propitiating the wandering dead.H.H. Scullard, Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic (Cornell University Press, 1981), pp. 110–111, 115–116. The season of roses thus coincided with traditional Roman festivals pertaining to blooming and dying. The demand for flowers and perfumes for festal and funerary purposes made floriculture an important economic activity, especially for the rich estates of Roman Africa.Salzman, On Roman Time, pp. 97–99; Holleran, Shopping in Ancient Rome, pp. 58, 119, 208–210. One Roman tomb painting shows vendors displaying floral garlands for sale.Holleran, Shopping in Ancient Rome, p. 210. Following the Lemuria, Mercury and Maia received a joint sacrifice during a merchants' festival on the Ides of May (the 15th). The Calendar of Filocalus (354 AD) notes a flower fair on May 23, when the roses come to market (macellus).Macellus rosas sumat: Phillips, Oxford Classical Dictionary, p. 1335. The month is illustrated for this calendar with a king of roses: a young man, wearing the long-sleeved robe called a dalmatica, carries a basket of roses on his left arm while holding a single flower in his right hand to smell. In other pictorial calendars, the Rose King or related imagery of the rose festival often substitutes for or replaces the traditional emblem of Mercury and his rites to represent May.Salzman, On Roman Time, pp. 97–99. In Ovid's Fasti, a poem about the Roman calendar, Flora as the divine representative of May speaks of her role in generating flowers from the blood of the dead: \\"through me glory springs from their wound\\".Ovid, Fasti 5.228 (de quorum per me volnere surgit honor); Carole E. Newlands, Playing with Time: Ovid and the Fasti (Cornell University Press, 1995), p. 110; Hersch, The Roman Wedding, p. 91. Ovid shows how her mythology weaves together themes of \\"violence, sexuality, pleasure, marriage, and agriculture.\\"Hersch, The Roman Wedding, p. 91. The Romans considered May an unpropitious month for weddings, a postponement that contributed to the popularity of June as a bridal month. Each day of the Lemuria in mid-May was a dies religiosus, when it was religiously prohibited to begin any new undertaking, specifically including marriage \\"for the sake of begetting children\\".Hersch, The Roman Wedding, pp. 46–47 and 90, citing Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.16.18, noting that the Lemuria and the procession of the Argei, which even the Romans themselves regarded as obscure and dauntingly archaic, endowed the entire month with an uneasy feeling. In the 4th century, the Rosalia was marked on the official calendar as a public holiday at the amphitheater with games (ludi) and theatrical performances. A calendar from Capua dating to 387 AD notes a Rosaria at the amphitheater on May 13.Feriale Capuanum (387 AD): III id. mai(as) Rosaria Amphitheatri; Salzman, On Roman Time p. 98. Christianization Our Lady in a Garland of Roses (mid-17th century) by Giovanni Battista Salvi da Sassoferrato, portraying the Madonna with both a crown of stars and a rose wreath In the 6th century, a \\"Day of Roses\\" was held at Gaza, in the Eastern Roman Empire, as a spring festival that may have been a Christianized continuation of the Rosalia.Nicole Belayche, \\"Pagan Festivals in Fourth-Century Gaza,\\" p. 17, citing Chorichius, and Talgam, \\"The Ekphrasis Eikonos of Procopius,\\" pp. 223–224, both in Christian Gaza in Late Antiquity. John of Gaza wrote two anacreontic poems that he says he presented publicly on \\"the day of the roses\\", and declamations by the Christian rhetorician ProcopiusNot the historian. and poetry by Choricius of Gaza are also set at rose-days.Westberg, \\"The Rite of Spring,\\" in Plotting with Eros, p. 189: ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν ῥόδων; Talgam, \\"The Ekphrasis Eikonos of Procopius,\\" p. 223. Roses were in general part of the imagery of Early Christian funerary art,Robin M. Jensen, \\"Christian Art,\\" in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 93. as was ivy.Gillian MacKie, \\"Symbolism and Purpose in an Early Christian Martyr Chapel: The Case of San Vittore in Ciel d'Oro, Milan,\\" Gesta 34.2 (1995), pp. 93–94. Martyrs were often depicted or described with flower imagery, or in ways that identified them with flowers. Paulinus of Nola (d. 431) reinterpreted traditions associated with the Rosalia in Christian terms for his natal poem (natalicium) about Saint Felix of Nola, set January 14:Patricia Cox Miller, \\"'The Little Blue Flower Is Red': Relics and the Poeticizing of the Body,\\" Journal of Early Christian Studies 8.2 (2000), p. 228. > Sprinkle the ground with flowers, adorn the doorways with garlands. Let > winter breathe forth the purple beauty (purpureum) of spring; let the year > be in flower before its time, and let nature submit to the holy day. For you > also, earth, owe wreaths to the martyr’s tomb. But the holy glory of the > doorway to the heavens encircles him, flowering with the twin wreaths of war > and peace.Paulinus of Nola, Carmen 14.110–116 = CSEL 30:50, as cited by > Miller. At one of the earliest extant martyr shrines, now part of the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio in Milan, a mosaic portrait dating perhaps as early as 397–402 depicts Saint Victor within a classically inspired wreath of lilies and roses, wheat stalks, grapes on the vine, and olive branches: the circular shape represents eternity, and the vegetation the four seasons.MacKie, \\"Symbolism and Purpose in an Early Christian Martyr Chapel,\\" pp. 93–95. In the Christian imagination, the blood-death-flower pattern is often transferred from the young men of Classical myth—primarily Adonis and Attis—to female virgin martyrs.Miller, The Corporeal Imagination, p. 205. Eulalia of Mérida is described by Prudentius (d. ca. 413) as a \\"tender flower\\" whose death makes her \\"a flower in the Church's garland of martyrs\\": the flow of her purple blood produces purple violets and blood-red crocuses (purpureas violas sanguineosque crocos), which will adorn her relics.Miller, The Corporeal Imagination, pp. 75–76, quoting Jill Ross. The rose can also symbolize the blood shed with the loss of virginity in the sacrament of marriage.John D. Miller, Beads and Prayers: The Rosary in History and Devotion (Burns & Oats, 2002), pp. 166–167. Drawing on the custom of floral crowns as awards in the Classical world, Cyprian (d. 258) described heavenly crowns of flowers for the faithful in the afterlife: lilies for those who did good works, and an additional crown of roses for martyrs.Ronald Lightbown, Carlo Crivelli (Yale University Press, 2004), p. 268. In one early passion narrative, a martyr wears a rose crown (corona rosea) at a heavenly banquet.Miller, The Corporeal Imagination, p. 75, citing the Passio Mariani et Iacobi. For Ambrose (d. 397), lilies were for virgins, violets for confessors of the faith, and roses for martyrs;Ambrose, Expositio in Lucam 7.128 (=PL 15, col. 1821), as noted by Clare Stancliffe, \\"Red, White and Blue Martyrdom,\\" in Ireland in Early Mediaeval Europe. Studies in memory of Kathleen Hughes (Cambridge University Press, 1982), p. 32; Lightbown, Carlo Crivelli, p. 268. of these, the imagery of the violet has no biblical precedent.Lightbown, Carlo Crivelli, p. 269. In a passage influenced by Vergilian imagery, Ambrose enjoins young women who are virgins to \\"Let the rose of modesty and the lily of the spirit flourish in your gardens, and let banks of violets drink from the spring that is watered by the sacred blood.\\"Ambrose, On Virgins 4.17; Boniface Ramsey, Ambrose (Routledge, 1997), pp. 110 and 223, note 40. In the description of Jerome (d. 420), \\"a crown of roses and violets\\" is woven from the blood of Saint Paula's martyrdom.Epistle to Eustochium 108.31 = CSEL 55, p. 349, as cited by Stancliffe, \\"Red, White and Blue Martyrdom,\\" pp. 30–31. Dante later entwines Classical and Christian strands of imagery in his Paradiso, linking the garland of saints with the rose corona of Ariadne, whom he imagines as translated to the heavens by it.Dante, Paradiso 13.13–15, as noted by Robert Hollander and Jean Hollander, Dante: Paradiso (Anchor Books, 2007), p. 353. The use of the term \\"rosary\\" (Latin rosarium, a crown or garland of roses) for Marian prayer beads was objected to by some Christians, including Alanus de Rupe, because it evoked the \\"profane\\" rose wreath of the Romans.Anne Winston- Allen, Stories of the Rose: The Making of the Rosary in the Middle Ages (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1997), pp. 81–82. Alanus, who played a key role in the development of the rosary, preferred the term \\"psalter\\". Memorial to Thérèse of Lisieux, inscribed with her motto \\"After my death, I will let fall a shower of roses\\"; she wears a floral wreathJohn J. Delaney, Dictionary of Saints (Random House, 2005), p. 656. Miracles involving roses are ascribed to some female saints, while roses are a distinguishing attribute of others ranging from Cecilia of Rome (d. 230 AD) to Thérèse of Lisieux (d. 1897).Stephen Wilson, \\"Cults of Saints in the Churches of Central Paris,\\" in Saints and Their Cults: Studies in Religious Sociology, Folklore, and History (Cambridge University Press, 1983), p. 242. The floral iconography of Saint Cecilia includes a rose or floral wreath, a palm branch, and a \\"tall sprig of almond leaves and flowers in her hand\\".A Glossary of Ecclesiastical Terms, edited by Orby Shipley (London, Oxford and Cambridge, 1872), pp. 99–100. Roses are among the most characteristic attributes of Mary, mother of Jesus, who became associated with the month of May,Richard Griffiths, Pen and the Cross: Catholicism and English Literature 1850–2000 (Continuum, 2010), p. 39. replacing goddesses such as Maia and Flora in the popular imagination.Charlene Spretnak, Missing Mary: The Queen of Heaven and Her Re-emergence in the Modern Church (Palgrave Macmillan, 2004), pp. 222–223; Lorraine Kochanske Stock, \\"Lords of the Wildwood: The Wild Man, the Green Man, and Robin Hood,\\" in Robin Hood in Popular Culture: Violence, transgression, and justice (D.S. Brewer, 2000), pp. 242, 245–247; J. Miller, Beads and Prayers, pp. 166–167. Mary is described in early Christian literature as a rosa pudoris, \\"rose of modesty\\",Ambrose, De virginibus 3, noted by Winston-Allen, Stories of the Rose, p. 88. and a rose among thorns.Sedulius, Paschale carmen, as cited by Winston-Allen, Stories of the Rose, p. 88. In the Middle Ages, roses, lilies and violets become the special flowers of Mary.Lightbown, Carlo Crivelli, p. 268. In some Catholic cultures, offerings of flowers are still made to Mary, notably in Mexican devotional practices for Our Lady of Guadalupe.Timothy Matovina, Latino Catholicism: Transformation in America's Largest Church (Princeton University Press, 2012), p. 175. On the island of Pollap, in Micronesia, offerings of flowers before the cult statue of Mary are added to ceremonies of the rosary especially for May; the concept of the rosary as a \\"crown of roses\\" complements local traditions of wearing a flower wreath on the head.Juliana Flinn, Mary, the Devil, and Taro: Catholicism and Women's Work in a Micronesian Society (University of Hawaii Press, 2010), pp. 147–148, 151. Latin hymns and litanies from the earliest Christian era name Mary as the \\"Mystical Rose\\" and by an array of rose epithets, or as a garden that bore Christ in the image of the rose.Winston-Allen, Stories of the Rose, pp. 88–89 et passim; J. Miller, Beads and Prayers, p. 166. Ambrose declared that the blood of Christ in the Eucharist, transubstantiated from wine, was to be perceived as a rose.Ambrose of Milan, on Psalm 118: Cernis Rosam, hoc est dominici corporis sanguineum, as quoted by R.T. Hampson, Medii Aevi Kalendarium, or Dates, Charters, and Customs of the Middle Ages (London,1841), vol. 1, p. 87. The five-petaled rose became a symbol of the Five Wounds of Christ and hence of the Resurrection.J. Miller, Beads and Prayers, p. 166. The living bodies and corpses of saints were said to exude a floral \\"odor of sanctity\\" as one of the most notable signs of their holiness.Constance Classen, The Color of Angels: Cosmology, Gender and the Aesthetic Imagination (Routledge, 1998), pp. 36–37. Pope Gregory I described the fragrance and luminosity of the rose as issuing from the blood of martyrs.Lightbown, Carlo Crivelli, p. 269. Herman of Steinfeld exhaled a fragrance \\"like a garden full of roses, lilies, violets, poppies and all kinds of fragrant flowers\\" as he prayed.Classen, The Color of Angels, p. 37. The bedridden virgin Lydwine of Schiedam was said to consume nothing but spiced wine, and wept \\"fragrant tears of blood\\" which she called her roses; when these dried on her cheeks overnight, they were gathered and kept in a box. The omen of her death was the opening of roses on a mystical rosebush, and when she was buried the bag of rose blood-tears was used as her pillow.Classen, The Color of Angels, pp. 38–39. Flowers, blood, and relics were interwoven in the imagery of Christian literature from the earliest period.Miller, The Corporeal Imagination, p. 73. Rose Sundays Feast of the Rosary (1506) by Dürer, an altarpiece for a rosary confraternity: a whole community is joined together in receiving white and red rose crownsNathan Mitchell, The Mystery of the Rosary: Marian Devotion and the Reinvention of Catholicism (New York University Press, 2009), pp. 25–27. Two days of the liturgical calendar have been called \\"Rose Sundays\\". The fourth Sunday of Lent is also known as Dominica de rosa (\\"Rose Sunday\\"), when rose-colored vestments may replace the purple or violet penitential vestments of the season. On this day the Pope blesses the Golden Rose, a jewel in the shape of a rose.P.M.J. Rock, \\"Golden Rose,\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (1909), vol. 6, p. 629; Matthew Bunson, Our Sunday Visitor's Encyclopedia of Catholic History (Our Sunday Visitor, 1995, 2004), p. 403. Benedict, a canon of St. Peter's Basilica in the mid-12th century, recorded a ceremony on this day when the Pope carried a moss-wrapped rose in the Stations of the Cross.The station on this fourth Sunday of Lent was at S. Croce in Ierusalemme, and the route took the Pope back to the Lateran Palace, where he presented the rose to the city prefect; H. E. J. Cowdrey, Pope Gregory VII, 1073–1085 (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 14, citing Benedict, cap. 36, p. 150. A 19th-century ecclesiastical lexicographer saw the Golden Rose as having functions analogous to the Golden Bough, with Mary assuming attributes of Persephone.Hampson, Medii Aevi Kalendarium, pp. 342–343. In medieval texts, Pentecost is sometimes called Rosalia or Rosata Pascha.Hampson, Medii Aevi Kalendarium, p. 341. The traditional Romanian name for Pentecost is Rusalii, thought to derive from Rosalia.Theodore A. Koehler,\\"The Christian Symbolism of the Rose\\", Roses and the Arts: A Cultural and Horticultural Engagement, Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio, May 8, 1986. In medieval Rome, a Dominica de Rosis (Sunday of Roses) or Pascha rosarum or rosatum was celebrated for the octave of the Feast of the Ascension, the Sunday before Pentecost. The Pope delivered a sermon about the Holy Spirit on this day at the Santa Maria Rotunda, the basilica converted from the ancient Pantheon. Rose petals were showered through the oculus in the dome to represent the descent of the tongues of flame.Cowdrey, Pope Gregory VII, p. 14, citing Benedict, cap. 61, p. 157; Cristina Mazzoni, Saint Hysteria: Neurosis, Mysticism, and Gender in European Culture (Cornell University Press, 1996), p. 144; F.G.

After dinner, a ludus Carnelevaris was celebrated with drinking among the knights and soldiers, followed by performances which featured the killing of animals that symbolized various sins.This included \\"the killing of a bear to symbolize the devil who tempted the flesh, of bullocks to symbolize their pride, and of a cockerel to symbolize their lusts; thus, they might live chastely and soberly, and keep a good Easter\\": Cowdrey, Pope Gregory VII, p. 14, citing Benedict, cap. 7(5), p. 172. The custom of scattering roses for Pentecost spread, and continued to the modern era, as reflected in feast names such as the Pasqua di rose or Pâques rosées.Mazzoni, Saint Hysteria, p. 144. Churches might be built with a \\"Holy Ghost hole\\" in the ceiling for the release of rose petals or white doves.Gertrud Muller Nelson, To Dance With God: Family Ritual and Community Celebration (Paulist Press, 1986), p. 27; Diana L.

The A registered shares of VP Bank are listed on SIX Swiss Exchange in Zurich, Switzerland. History VP Bank headquarters in Vaduz 1956 through 1962: Founding and development Until 1956, there were only two banks in Liechtenstein: the Liechtensteinische Landesbank as an institution governed by public law, and Bank in Liechtenstein AG, a private-law company. On 6 April 1956, Guido Feger founded Verwaltungs- und Privat-Bank – today's VP Bank – in the legal form of a Liechtenstein institution with start-up capital of 2 million Swiss francs. The founding was a logical extension of Guido Feger's Allgemeinen Treuunternehmens (ATU), at the time the largest and oldest trust company in Vaduz. In 1956, it employed 13 people in Liechtenstein and, on behalf of clients, four offices workers in foreign countries. Together, they catered to the needs of roughly 900 clients in matters pertaining to the fiduciary administration of real estate interests, securities portfolios and current accounts – mainly in the CHF realm and the United States – as well as patent rights, loans and fixed-term deposits. Guido Feger was granted a concession for his bank only after a second attempt: he had already submitted an application on 15 July 1955 for approval to conduct all types of banking transactions. As Liechtenstein's Persons and Companies Act included a protective clause in favour of the Landesbank, the government at the time rejected the application by stating the following: \\"Inasmuch as the founding of a private bank would have a strong impact on the interests of the Liechtensteinische Landesbank and encroach upon the business field, the petition has been turned down.\\" In verbal negotiations, Feger thereafter promised \\"…to safeguard the Liechtenstein character of the bank both in terms of its corporate bodies and the employment of local residents.\\" On 22 March 1956, he submitted a set of regulations specifying that the organisation and business activities of the proposed bank were not to compete with the Landesbank. In response, the government ultimately granted the concession on 4 April 1956, whereby those regulations were deemed an integral part of the approval. They were binding on Guido Feger as a person and dictated that the bank may accept no savings deposits, conduct no foreign currency exchange and not grant loans (including mortgage lending). Thus in the early years, the bank had to concentrate almost entirely on non-domestic activities. However, in building up its business, VP Bank was able to benefit from the relationships that ATU had already fostered since 1929 with banks, financial intermediaries and private clients in Switzerland and elsewhere abroad. Over the six years between 1956 and 1962, the net assets of VP Bank increased steadily from six million to 15 million Swiss francs. 1963 through 1969: Initial growth phase After the founding and development years as well as its conversion into a joint-stock company, VP Bank's size and profitability grew significantly between 1963 and 1969. By 1969 its total assets stood at CHF 150 million, while revenues continued to rise during that period and client assets under management had increased from 19 million to 134 million Swiss francs. That growth was attributable to the fact that, since 1963, the bank was allowed to conduct all banking activities not subject to official rules and regulations. In December 1967, parliament abrogated the contingency of the banking concession on the founder and hence the related time limitation for VP Bank. In return, VP Bank committed to keeping at all times a minimum of 60 per cent of its voting rights and 51 per cent of its share capital legally and beneficially in the hands of Liechtenstein citizens. 1970 through 1979: Difficult years The economic environment for VP Bank in the period between 1970 and 1979 was marked by currency, stock market and banking crises. Historically high inflation rates, a devaluation of the Swiss franc in 1971, the plummeting US dollar exchange rate, collapsing stock prices, scandals surrounding Cologne's Herstatt-Bank in 1974 and Switzerland's SKA in 1977, along with a recession in Liechtenstein that started in 1975 – the first in the post-WWII era for the Principality – all combined to make the 1970s indeed a turbulent decade. To defend against excessive capital inflows from abroad, the Swiss government in June 1972 prohibited the payment of interest on foreign CHF-denominated deposits and imposed a commission on them (negative interest rates of up to ten per cent quarterly, i.e. 40 per cent per year). Liechtenstein was declared a foreign country with regard to currency; however, upon Liechtenstein's adoption of the relevant Swiss provisions, the Federal Council once again granted the Principality domestic status for currency and foreign exchange purposes as of 1 August 1973. VP Bank increased its share capital twice by 15 million Swiss francs in 1974 and 1979. And finally, the bank was granted in 1975 a full concession to offer the entire range of banking products, including savings accounts and mortgages. During this consolidation phase, its total assets increased from 150 to 530 million Swiss francs and the workforce more than doubled from 41 to 86. 1980 through 2000: Renewed upswing VP Bank counter hall in Vaduz The bank, which had established a number of foreign subsidiary companies in the years after 1988, published its first consolidated financial statements for the 1995 business year. Over the two decades of this boom phase, its total assets increased from 530 million (end-1979) to 10.9 billion Swiss francs (end-2000), reported total net income rose from CHF 2.9 million to 197 million, and the workforce more than sextupled from 86 to 563. The main book turnover (single-sided) of the parent bank alone surged from 6.7 to 77.3 billion Swiss francs between 1980 and 1989. Business for VP Bank Group flourished in the second half of the 1990s: total Group assets grew from 6.3 billion (1995) to 10.9 billion Swiss francs (2000) and gross income (revenues less operating expenses) from CHF 94 million to 254 million, whereas the commission and services business overtook the interest- differential business in 1997 as the major pillar of the income statement. In the years between 1996 and 2000, there was also a doubling of client assets under management from CHF 15 billion (end-1995) to 31 billion. Consolidated net income increased from 48 million (1995) to 197 million (2000) Swiss francs. As the significance of VP Bank Group's foreign subsidiary companies grew, the proportion of investments attributable to them (assets held in non- CHF regions) increased as well, from 22 per cent (1996) to 40 per cent (2000) and ultimately to a high of 58.3 per cent at the end of 2005. As always, VP Bank placed those funds only with top-rated banks. The progressively internationalised bank redoubled its risk management efforts in the late 1990s and introduced an Asset and Liability Committee. 2001 through 2006: Crisis, restructuring and recovery VP Bank Group's total assets declined in 2001 and 2002 by almost 20 per cent to CHF 8.9 billion. Consolidated net income also fell from 197 million Swiss francs in 2000 to 68 million (2001) and ultimately 38 million (2002). Despite the cost-saving measures introduced in early 2002, gross income (revenues less operating expenses at current prices) shrunk during this time frame from CHF 254 million to 36 million, with the lion's share of that decrease being attributable to securities-related income. Given the dismal financial market environment, the bank was forced to haircut the value of its proprietary securities holdings (including its own VP Bank shares) report a loss of 38 million (2001) and 75 million (2002) Swiss francs for this business segment. The collapse in 2002 was also attributable to a decrease in assets under management from CHF 29.6 billion (2001) to 25.2 billion (2002) as well as disadvantageous exchange rate trends. During 2002, the workforce was reduced from 563 to 549 employees. A recovery got underway in 2003, with gross income surging back to 139 million Swiss francs and consolidated net income to CHF 95 million, thereby putting the bank back on its successful pre-crisis course. By the end of 2006, total assets had returned to CHF 9.5 billion (2005: 8.2 billion), consolidated net income to 132 million (2005: 119 million), and assets under management rose to 35.5 billion Swiss francs (2005: 30.1 billion). Gross income of CHF 174 million now stood 30 per cent higher than two years earlier (2004: 134 million). 2007: Additional subsidiaries in Dubai and Hong Kong In April, VP Bank opens a new office in Dubai and then in September an asset management company in Singapore. 2008: VP Bank receives banking licence in Singapore In June, the MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) grants VP Bank Group a banking licence to do business in Singapore. Die VP Bank (Schweiz) AG in Zurich moved from the old stock exchange building to new premises at Bahnhofstrasse 3. 2009: CEO, Adolf E. Real leaves VP Bank / Liechtenstein is taken off the \\"grey list\\" In 2009, Liechtenstein signs thirteen international agreements on cooperation in tax matters, which in turn led to its removal from the so-called \\"grey list\\" of the OECD. For Liechtenstein, the treaties with large countries such as the USA, Great Britain, Germany and France afforded the greatest positive effect in terms of credibility, reputational gains and legal certainty for clients. The Liechtenstein banks continued to demonstrate their financial strength and stability also in 2009 – compared to their European peers, they stood out for their high equity capital ratios and needed no state support during the financial crisis. In keeping with tradition, they perform no investment banking activities but instead focus on private banking and wealth management. 2010: Roger H. Hartmann named new CEO of VP Bank Group On 4 February 2010, the board of directors of Verwaltungs- und Privat-Bank Aktiengesellschaft elects Roger H. Hartmann to become the future chief executive officer of VP Bank Group. He took over that post on 1 April 2010 from Fredy Vogt, who had led VP Bank during the past five months on an ad interim basis. 2011: Equipped for the future Luxembourg becomes the final banking location of VP Bank Group to integrate the Avaloq banking software system. As a result, the products and services of the entire VP Bank Group can be efficiently and easily harmonised and adapted to client needs. 2012: Fredy Vogt becomes new chairman of the board of the VP Bank Group As previously announced at the 2011 annual general meeting of shareholders, Hans Brunhart, after 18 years of membership on the board of directors and sixteen of which, as its chairman, decides not to stand for re-election. In 2012, Fredy Vogt succeeded him as member and chairman of the board of directors after having been with VP Bank in various functions ever since 1987. 2013: Alfred W. Moeckli becomes new CEO of VP Bank Group The board of directors names Alfred W. Moeckli to become the new chief executive officer of VP Bank Group. He takes over this function as of 1 May 2013 from Siegbert Näscher, CFO, and Juerg W. Sturzenegger, COO, who co-headed the bank on an ad interim basis since mid-July 2012. VP Bank initiates takeover of the private banking activities of HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt (International) SA as well as its private banking-related fund business in Luxembourg. 2014-2015: VP Bank and Centrum Bank are merging Continuing its reliance on growth through acquisitions, VP Bank Group takes over Centrum Bank of Vaduz, Liechtenstein, in a merger. In January 2015 VP Bank's acquisition of all share of Centrum Bank has been executed. As of 7 January 2015, Centrum Bank is a subsidiary of VP Bank.

The barn was built in 1878 by Jacob Bowerman, a local cattle rancher. Bowerman built the barn by hand with whipsawn pine wood and board and batten siding, and the barn is a relatively uncommon example of such a hand-crafted design. The barn served as part of Bowerman's ranch, which originally included a ranch house, milk house, and wagon shed, all of which burned down. Bowerman sold beef and dairy products to wholesalers and businesses in Minersville, and his business played a significant role in the development of the regional economy. Bowerman died in 1917, and the barn was subsequently used for sheep farming and storage until the U.S. Forest Service purchased the property in 1974.

Ross (July 14, 1950) is a Canadian psychiatrist and former president of the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation from 1993 to 1994. There is controversy about his methods and claims, which include recovered memory through hypnosis of Satanic ritual abuse and his own assertion that he can harness chi energy from his eyes to manipulate electronics.http://www.process.org/discept/2010/02/08/dr-colin-a-ross- psychiatry-the-supernatural-and-malpractice-most-foul/ Ross works in the Ross Institute for Psychological Trauma, a hospital in the Dallas, Texas area. He also directs a trauma program at Forest View Psychiatric Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Most of the people the Ross Institute treats describe very traumatic and abusive childhoods. Ross has also produced several documentaries and educational films about Dissociative Identity Disorder. In 1999, he teamed with producer James Myer in the making of Multiple Personality: Reality and Illusion. The docu-drama featured Chris Costner Sizemore, a woman that became famous because of a rare diagnosis (at that time) of Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD). Ms. Sizemore's life was portrayed by Joanne Woodward in the Fox motion picture The Three Faces of Eve. In the past, Ross was contractor for psycho-pharmaceutical companies; he has been called to participate in neuroleptic trials and continues to publish in the American Journal of Psychiatry. Repressed memory controversy In his writings, e.g., Trauma Model Therapy: A Treatment Approach for Trauma, Dissociation and Complex Comorbidity, he makes a clear distinction between repression and dissociation. However, Ross's work has been challenged in lawsuits in the USA and Canada. Alleged victim Roma Hart, a former patient of Colin Ross', litigated against him in Canada. Hart made the following statement in an interview with atheist activist and Satanic Temple co-founder, Doug Mesner, also known by the alias Lucien Greaves: \\"[…]I was regularly in seclusion [whilst an in-patient of Colin Ross], a lovely concrete walled and floored hole where I was locked in for days at a time. Sometimes [I would be] thrown in, and I'd have the huge bruises to show for it. [The seclusion room] was often used for \\"behaviour modification\\", I suppose. You see, when I had seizures from the drugs [Ross had over-medicated], Ross told the nurses that I was just switching personalities to one called \\"Blue\\" that had seizures, so they should throw me in seclusion whenever that happened. One evening when [the seizures were] really bad, Ross had the nurses take me down to the ward below and strip me before they dropped me onto the floor. That [particular] seclusion room had a bad fluorescent light that flickered really badly. I laid there until the next day when they put me in a wheelchair to take me back up to my other seclusion room. Those nurses, as I told you before, followed Ross around like panting puppies and did anything he said. I remember when I had my blood pressure taken my nurse asked me if I knew why my blood pressure was so unstable. I was going to answer \\"the drugs?\\", but before I could say anything she said, \\"it's because each of your personalities has its own blood pressure.\\" And, of course, [there was] the time that I was nearly killed from an overdose on the ward and I barely made it to the nurse's station, gasping for breath, (respiratory arrest) [trying to] get their attention. The nurses became angry at me and demanded that I go back to my room. I fell to the floor and crawled back to my room still struggling with every ounce of my strength for every breath. This was extremely frightening and I was so close to dying. I made it to my bed and the nurse took my blood pressure. She wrote it on my bed sheet as a matter of fact: 190/180. The following day after I regained consciousness another nurse came in and took my blood pressure: 60/50. Well, she remarked, you MPD patients are fascinating. [...] Ross had told the staff that night that I had \\"pulled myself in\\" and that it was an \\"MPD coma\\", not a real coma.\\" Claims of paranormal ability In 2008, Ross applied for the James Randi Educational Foundation's One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge with the claim that energy from his eyes could cause a speaker, receiving no other input, to sound a tone. In 2010, Ross published experimental data that supports his scientific hypothesis that the eyes emit energy that can be captured and measured in the Anthropology of Consciousness, a journal of the American Anthropological Association.Wiley Interscience During correspondence with Steven Novella of The Skeptic's Guide to the Universe, he conceded that the equipment he was using was a biofeedback machine attached to his laptop, and that the laptop was responding in a well-understood way to an eye blink. However, he claimed that he could still send energy beams out of his eyes, and was working on modifying the software to ignore an eyeblink. His claim has not currently been tested by the JREF. In 2008, he was granted the tongue-in-cheek Pigasus Award. Bibliography Ross has written several bookshttps://www.amazon.com/Colin-A.-Ross/e/B001HCV7VQ/ about psychiatry and related subjects.

He showed glimpses of his attacking batting in his very first match for Nepal. After the blitz against Kuwait, Binod's adventure in the national fold remained a silent one before he confirmed his permanent arrival with his two sixes against the UAE in the 2013 ACC Twenty20 Cup semi-final handed Nepal a maiden final spot.

Forest Glen is located on California State Route 36, south- southwest of Hayfork. With a population around 10 permanent residents and 20 seasonal Forest Service cabin owners, visitors often drive right through in 30 seconds little realizing there was a town.  History  In 1913, Arthur H. Jeans built a waystation for travellers on the new Red Bluff-Eureka road, now known as State Route 36, at Forest Glen, then known as Auto Rest. It included a resort, a hotel, a store, a stable, and a garage, and was reputed to be Trinity County's most popular resort before it burnt to the ground in 1950. The Forest Glen Store stayed open for longer, but closed by the early 2000s. As of 2020, CalFire recently reopened a station in Forest Glen, with one engine. A post office called Auto Rest ran from September 13th, 1917, until March 9th, 1920, when the name was changed to Forest Glen. Arthur Jeans was the first postmaster, succeeded by Charles H. Matthews on July 21st, 1919.  Geography  Forest Glen is situated at the base of South Fork Mountain, one of the longest continuous ridge lines in North America. State Route 36, locally known as 36, passes through the community. The South Fork of the Trinity River, one of the longest undammed river systems in California, also runs through the community. A Forest Service campground, Scott Flat, is located immediately southwest of the community. Scott Flat also serves as the trailhead for the South Fork Trinity National Recreation trail.  Climate  A public weather station ran at Forest Glen from 1930 to 1985. Forest Glen is reputed to be one of the wettest places in Trinity County, with over 60 inches of precipitation over the weather station's period of record. The weather station recorded a record high of 110 degrees Fahrenheit on 8/8/1959 and a record low of -2 degrees on 12/11/1932. The average July high and low was 91 and 46 degrees, and for January it was 44.9 and 26.6 degrees respectively. The first and last months with average lows above freezing were April and October, with lows of 33.2 and 35.2 respectively. The area is very Mediterranean, with 92% of the precipitation between October 1st and May 31st and 77% between November 1st and March 31st. The average precipitation for January is 11.61 inches, and for July it is 0.22 inches. There is an annual precipitation average of 63.52 inches. There is measurable precipitation on 88 days of the year, and 21 days see more than an inch of precipitation. Forest Glen sees about 40 inches of snowfall each winter, ranging from 0 inches to 103 inches over the period of record. The record high snow depth is 43 inches, seen on 1/3/1965 and 2/3/1937. 59.4 days a year reach 90 degrees, and 136.9 dip to 32 degrees, including 0.9 in June. Forest Glen has seen frost every month of the year, but the 30% chance date in the spring is in mid-June, and in the fall it is mid-to-late-September. On average, the highest temperature Forest Glen will see in a year is 103 degrees, and the lowest is 11 degrees. In January 1949, the average low was 11.84 degrees, the lowest monthly average low on record, and the highest monthly average low was July 1958, with 51.19 degrees. The highest average high was July 1952, with 97.52 degrees, and the lowest monthly average high was January 1937, with 37.68 degrees. The wettest winter was 1973-74, with 112.14 inches of precipitation, but 82-83 was close behind with 106.88 inches. A major flood event occurred in the winter of 1964-65. It is known as the Christmas Flood of 1964, and it was one of the biggest, if not the biggest, flood in California history. Forest Glen recorded over 33 inches of precipitation in December 1964, which led to a discharge of 20,000 cubic feet per second at the South Fork Trinity River gauge Forest Glen in mid- December. The flood caused widespread damage across the watershed, most notably the complete devastation of the salmon and steelhead fisheries due to topsoil erosion in the watershed on logged areas. The runs of fish have never fully recovered. If a similar event were to happen today, the effects would likely be much less devastating as nearly all logging in the watershed has ceased, and has been so for nearly 30 years.

These pieces can be easily added by using poker chips, coins or other suitably sized objects. The game seeks to incorporate portals to allow pieces to teleport around the board. Apart from the portals and their ruleset, the game often plays like ordinary chess, including en passant, castling, and pawn promotion. Versions There are three versions of portal chess, created seemingly independently by three different people: David Howe in 1997,David Howe at chessvariants.org Mike Hidden some time before 2008,Mike Hidden's site and Ian Buckley around 2012.Youtube video with rules They all, however, contain the core dynamic of teleportation and special squares/pieces for this, as opposed to other variants which allow transportation at any point and/or any time. Throughout the article, the symbol \\"→\\" will be used to denote teleportation from one square to another. David Howe version In this version, there are two distinct playing areas linked by fixed portals. These areas can be either two separate boards or one board split down the middle (between the d- and e-files). The rules that are different for this variant are: *Players alternate play between area A and area B. So play might go 1:Ae4 Ba5 2:Bh4 Ae5 *If a player's piece is on a portal square when the player is playing in that board, he can declare an intent to teleport. He moves no other piece, and waits for his turn on the other board. He then teleports his piece but makes no other move, e.g. 20: 'Intends to teleport' qBe7 21: qAa4→Ba4 ... *Teleportation is always between areas, and also between corresponding squares (as close to the original coordinates as you can get). *If an opponent's piece occupies the target square when teleporting, it is captured normally. (qAa4→xBa4) *If a friendly piece is on the receiving teleporter when 'Intent' is declared, the move is still lost but with no teleportation. This could be used as a pass function. e.g. 20: 'Intends to teleport' qBe7 21: (no move, piece in way) Aa6 ... *If both players declare 'intent' in the same move, the teleportations are considered simultaneous. Thus no capture would occur between two pieces transporting together if they had just swapped places. e.g. 20: 'intent' 'intent' 21: Aa4→Ba4 Ba4→Aa4 *A king can be left in check so long as the player can move it before it could be captured. Thus discovered checks from teleportations are allowed as the player can move their king away before their opponent next plays that Area. *All other rules are the same. Mark Hidden version The portals in this game are neutral yet mobile. The number and starting location of these portals can be different when the game begins, but the image shows the standard set-up. In this game the portal pieces move around by very specific rules. *A piece can only land on a portal square by attacking it. This means pawns move diagonally onto them, and knights must land directly on them. *A piece can not jump over a portal, except for the knight. *When a piece moves onto a portal, it must move to another portal. If no portals are free to do this, moving onto the portal is not allowed. *When a piece has moved through a portal, the portal it attacked moves to where the piece used to be. So the early move 2: f3xg4→c4 moves the portal from g4 to f3. *This also means portals may stack, and may be unstacked, but it is invalid to claim you have teleported from one stacked portal to another stacked portal (either where you have landed or elsewhere on the board). *Pawns must move normally onto the to promote. So a pawn that has teleported there does not promote, as he is stuck in the portal. *Castling cannot occur if a portal is in the way, as the pieces cannot jump over it. *All other ordinary rules apply. Ian Buckley version This version of the game has player-controlled portals, which are linked to each other. The rules for these portals are worked out as though they make the squares they cover into one square. In the set up to the right, a5 and e4 can be conceptualized as the same square. The specific rules for portal use are as follows: *The aim of portal chess is the same as ordinary chess. *Players place their portals anywhere on the fourth row from the players side before commencing a game. *You can only move your colored portal. *A piece passes through portal unless the portal is blocked. *A piece can be blocked from entering a portal if a piece of the same color is on the other side. *A piece can take pieces by traveling through a portal. *Both portals cannot be occupied at the same time. *A piece can check/checkmate players using the portal. *A piece must exit the portal in the direction it traveled into the portal. *A portal can be moved onto a piece causing it to teleport, unless the other portal is occupied by any piece. *A player has a choice to move a chess piece or the portal piece in one turn, not both. *If your own chess piece is occupying a portal, you cannot pass through or rest on the other unoccupied portal with another one of your own pieces. *A piece can enter either portal regardless of color. *If both portals occupy the same square, it creates a black hole, which will remove any pieces in the eight squares around it from the game, as well as any piece on the black hole. This also locks both the portals in place so they can no longer be moved. *A portal can be moved regardless of whether it is occupied or not, the occupying piece does not move with the portal. *If a piece occupies one portal and a whole turn phase end without the piece moving from the teleporter it does not teleport. *A knight can jump over a portal piece. *A pawn can become a queen by using a portal, thus the move ...→h8=Q is valid.

Biography   Early life and family  Bernard Fixot was born in Villejuif, France to a Briton family and grew up in Arcueil, a southern suburb of Paris. His father was a street cop with the Gentilly police station and his mother was a factory receptionist. He learned to read in primary school in the Arcueil public school system and continued his schooling in nearby Bagneux, where he discovered his passion for books and reading. This passion would clearly define the rest of his professional life. After a brief stint at the prestigious Lycée Henri IV in Paris, he decides to leave school early with the goal of gaining entry into the publishing world by any means necessary. His only degree is the Certificat d’études primaries. Years later, he is pleased to discover that he learned to read with the same schoolteacher, Madame Tap, as French writer Jean Teulé (The Suicide Shop) and fashion designer Jean-Paul Gaultier.  Career = 1960-1969 : Hachette = A self-made man, he starts to work at the age of 17 in the stock room at Hachette for three years. After completing his military service, he spends two years as a sales representative for Hachette's mass market paperback division, Le Livre de Poche and another two for the Gallimard account. = 1969-1978 : Gallimard = In 1969, he leaves Hachette to become an independent sales representative. That same year, Editions Gallimard splits from the Hachette Group and offers him a position as a sales executive, which he accepts. At age 27, he becomes sales manager and then sales director of the Gallimard Group (Editions Gallimard, Denoël, Mercure de France). There, he oversees the creation of Gallimard's sales force and takes part in the launch of mass market imprint Folio as well as the creation of the Children's division Gallimard Jeunesse with Pierre Marchard and Jean-Olivier Héron. He leaves the company after seven years, once Gallimard's sales and distribution are autonomous and successful. = 1978-1987 : Hachette =  1978 : Editions N°1  In 1978, the Hachette Group, then run by Jacques Marchandise and Gérard Worms, ask him to restructure Hachette Livres' sales department and to create Editions n°1, the first publishing house in France to combine a traditional publisher (Hachette) with a media group (Europe 1 radio station); he accepts on condition that he be able to create his own publishing house two years later, shared 50/50% with Hachette. Edition n°1's major successes are The Guinness Book of World Records, The World Book of Inventions by Valérie-Anne Giscard d’Estaing, who would become Fixot's wife, and the works of Pierre Bellemare and Paul-Loup Sulitzer.  1980 : Editions BFB  In 1980, alongside Editions n°1, he creates with Hachette as intended Editions BFB, which he shares with his friend Bernard Barrault. This publishing house, quite literary in nature, publishes authors such as Philippe Djian and Sylvie Caster as well as Histoires brèves, several collections of previously unpublished short stories written by well-known French authors.  1983 : Hachette Group Mass Market  In 1983, Jean-Luc Lagardère purchases the Hachette Group and asks Bernard Fixot to become Branch Director of the mass market division, including the paperback (Le Livre de Poche) and children's (Hachette Jeunesse) departments, while continuing to run his own two publishing houses. He organizes a contest for all the graphic designers in France to modernise Le Livre de Poche’s covers. The winner is a young drafted soldier. His design is used to create the “Biblio” collection. At the same time, he revives the “Bibliothèque Rose” and “Bibliothèque Verte” children's collections.  1984 : “Great Writers”  In 1984, he creates the “Great Writers” collection, coedited with the Filipacchi Press Group, more particularly with Roger Thérond of Paris Match and radio station Europe 1. The concept, meant to encourage the general public, including non-readers, to take interest in literature, was a magazine about the life of an author packaged with a novel by that same author and distributed by the press. There were 100 issues of the magazine-book package, which earned the support and cooperation of the Académie Goncourt. More that 10 million copies were sold in just two years. At his friend Pierre Barret's (Chairman of Europe 1) request, he also becomes the Managing Director of Publicity and Shows for Europe 1. He hosts, with Michel Drucker's participation, a one-hour weekly show during which he talks about the life of a writer. Three years after the success of the “Great Writer’s” collection, Bernard Fixot creates the “Great Painters” collection with the same partners. Sales rise to 5 million copies after a very memorable launch: a contest for which first prize is an original Renoir painting. = 1987 : Editions Fixot = In 1987, after a disagreement with Jean-Claude Lattès, Managing Director of Hachette Livre, Bernard Fixot decides to leave the group to create his own publishing house, Editions Fixot.Les éditeurs du SNE The two months following is the only period in his career that he stops working! Editions Fixot is a trade publisher with a catalogue of mainly non- fiction. His team is made up of Antoine Audouard (Managing Director), Anne Gallimard (Editorial Director), Edith Leblond (Financial Director) and Susanna Lea (Foreign Rights Manager). The house's first major success is Not without My Daughter by Betty Mahmoody, acquired on the last day of the Frankfurt Book Fair after it had been refused by publishers throughout the world. It would later become a success in many countries (Germany, Sweden, etc.) and adapted into a movie directed by Brian Gilbert starring Sally Field in the role of Betty Mahmoody. Bernard Fixot sells over 3.5 million copies of the book in France. Editions Fixot publishes non-fiction narratives, stories of the extraordinary lives of ordinary people, such as: * The Swan Dive by Maud MarinA Gender Variance Who's Who (the first autobiography in France of a transsexual) * Seule tout en haut à droite by Yann Piat (autobiography of the first female deputy of France's National Front party) * J’avais 12 ans by Nathalie Schweighoffer (the first major French narrative about incest) Bernard Fixot also seeks out people throughout the world with amazing stories to tell: * Sold: Story of Modern-day Slavery by Zana Muhsen, a young British woman from Birmingham sold into marriage in Yemen by her father. Bernard Fixot spends 2 days in Yemen with Jean-Pierre Foucault to try and free her. * My Feudal Lord by Tehmina Durrani (Pakistan) * I was Born with Sand in my Eyes by Mano Dayak (autobiography of a Touareg tribal leader) He publishes numerous biographies and autobiographies, notably on: * King of Spain Juan Carlos, The King, written by José Luis de Vilallonga * Passions by Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber * It Snowed on Mount Vitocha by Eddie Vartan. He also publishes books by Roger Vadim (Brigitte Bardot, Catherine Deneuve, Jane Fonda) and Frédéric Mitterrand, who would become French Minister of Culture. Alongside these very commercial titles, Bernard Fixot launches a collection of young writers called “Night Blue” featuring debut novelists such as Americans Jonathan Franzen with The Twenty-Seventh City and Michael Chabon with The Mysteries of Pittsburgh and French women Yolaine Destremau (A l’ombre des jacarandas), Pascale Gautier (Moribondes) or Marie-Ange Guillaume's Ils s’en allaient faire des enfants ailleurs. He also publishes Patrick Besson's plays. He continues on the path of the “Great Writers” collection: making people read who usually don not. In 1992, he creates a “Library” collection. The first three publications are of Baudelaire, Zola and Stendhal, prefaced by prominent French writers of the time. The concept of this new collection is to provide non-readers with condensed versions of great French literary works, in the spirit of Reader's Digest but somewhat different. For example, Stendhal's The Red and the Black has 45 chapters. The “Library” edition has only 19 and the remaining chapters are summarized, allowing less-avid readers to get excited about the story. Fixot was lambasted by the press for having dared alter such a classic work and the collection was a failure. Yet, five years later, another French publisher, Marabout, successfully developed the same idea. Times had changed.  1988 : TF1 Editions  In 1988, he founds a new publishing house, TF1 Editions (the number one French television station), with which he publishes books linked to the eponymous television station: books on health related to the show Santé à la une (the Mayo Clinic’s Family Health Book for example), cook books by chef Joël Robuchon, host of the show “Cuisinez comme un grand chef”, novelizations of soap operas, illustrated books about major sporting events, etc.  1990 : Berlitz  In 1990, he launches a highly- successful foreign language collection with Berlitz: Yes, I can for English, Si yo puedo for Spanish and Si io posso for Italian. = 1993-1999 : Editions Robert Laffont = In 1993, Christian Brégou, Chairman of the CEP media group (that would become Editis), asks him to take over the prestigious publishing house, Editions Robert Laffont. Robert Laffont, who founded the house in 1941, had been obliged to step down a few years earlier for health reasons and the house had been ailing ever since. Bernard Fixot accepts with great enthusiasm and merges Editions Fixot with Editions Robert Laffont. He thus becomes chairman of Robert Laffont, Seghers, Julliard and Fixot. He restructures the house with Antoine Audouard and entrusts Julliard to Bernard Barrault who makes this imprint shine again. In six years, the Robert Laffont group reclaims its spot as one of the major French trade publishers. These years are particularly marked by the resurgence of the historical novel: * Christian Jacq publishes 5 volumes of his Ramses series and sells over 13 million copies throughout the world (the series is translated in more than 30 languages) * Max Gallo publishes a series on Napoleon in 4 volumes, which is adapted into a successful TV series in 2002 (a mini-series with 4 100-minute episodes, produced by Jean-Pierre Guérin, directed by Yves Simoneau and starring Christian Clavier as Napoleon, Isabella Rosselini as Josephine de Beauharnais, Gérard Dépardieu as Joseph Fouché and John Malkovich as Talleyrand). Many “Fixot” style testimonies are also published during this time: * At Age 17, We are Carefree by Barbara Samson (the first account from a French person with AIDS) * Zlata’s Diary by Zlata Filipovic, a 12-year-old Croatian girl. Bernard Fixot succeeded in helping her and her parents escape war-torn Sarajevo. Her account was translated into 32 languages, was a No. 1 best-seller in the United States and movie rights were licensed to Universal. * Noa Rabin's account following the assassination of her grandfather, Yitzhak RabinThe First Step in Book Marketing * The Bandit Queen of India by Phoolan Devi * Former US schoolteacher Marie Letourneau's account of the relationship with 13-year-old Vili Fualaau that put her in jail\\"Mary Letourneau, la prisonnière de l'amour\\", Paris Match ...as well as biographies and autobiographies on Jimmy Goldsmith and Olivier de Kersauson and some impressive new fiction bestsellers such as Nicholas Sparks, Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child, Kathy Reichs and Daniel Silva. He continues to publish well-known bestsellers such as Michael Crichton, John Grisham and Ken Follett. In 1997, Bernard Fixot, publishes a collective work that was his idea: The Black Book of Communism. This work included the first complete inventory of victims of communist regimes and its publication created violent polemics and was a world-wide success with more than 26 translations. Two other publications should be highlighted: The Diving Bell and the Butterfly by Jean-Dominique Bauby and If Only it were True/Just Like Heaven, Marc Lévy's first novel.Il était une fée, L'Express, January 13, 2000 Film rights to both novels were sold to Steven Spielberg. = Since 1999: XO Editions = Having completed his mission at Editions Robert Laffont, in 1999, Bernard Fixot creates XO EditionsLes éditeurs du SNE with Edith Leblond and the Editis publishing group.

It stars Pierce Brosnan, Toni Collette, Imogen Poots, and Aaron Paul as four strangers who meet on the roof of a London building on New Year's Eve, each with the intent of committing suicide. Their plans for death in solitude are ruined when they meet as they decide to come down from the roof alive, however temporary that may be. Plot Martin Sharp (Pierce Brosnan) is contemplating suicide on New Year's Eve on the roof of the Toppers Building, high above London's streets. He is interrupted by a woman, Maureen (Toni Collette), who has the same fate in mind. She shyly offers to wait her turn, until two other strangers, a young woman named Jess (Imogen Poots) and a pizza deliverer called J.J. (Aaron Paul), also turn up. Martin is recognized by the others, having been a popular television personality before going to prison for a relationship with a girl who turned out to be 15. After talking things over, the four strangers form a pact, vowing to wait at least until Valentine's Day before taking their lives. Maureen has a disabled son she adores, but little life beyond that. Jess is the daughter of a politician (Sam Neill) and their relationship is strained. J.J. is an American who once played in a band, but while his three new acquaintances are suicidally depressed, he claims that he is terminally ill with cancer. To profit from misfortune, Martin hatches a scheme that makes them the talk of London, claiming their mass suicide was interrupted by a vision. They end up on his old TV chat show, where Martin's former co-host Penny (Rosamund Pike) makes her guests feel humiliated and even more depressed. The four go off to a vacation resort to get away from London's attention. They enjoy each other's company, at least until a confession by one of them and the intervention of a reporter named Kathy drives them apart. Matty, Maureen's son, has a heart attack but recovers. Jess and Martin visit Maureen in the hospital but J.J. can't be contacted. They realise it's Valentine's Day and that their pact has ended. All four end up back in London on the very same rooftop with the other three coaxing J.J. off the edge successfully. On New Year's Eve that year, they video call each other. Martin is looking after his daughter, Maureen is enjoying herself at a New Year's party, and J.J. and Jess are in a happy relationship.

While reading the script for the film in the Colombe D'Or restaurant in Saint-Paul- de-Vence, Brosnan stated that he saw Madeley and his wife Judy Finnigan and later said \\"I think it's his sheer ebullience and enthusiasm. You have to be almost shamanic to do it, really, and really believe in yourself. And it's a thin line between being affable and being really annoying. So it takes a brave soul, really.\\" Release The film premiered at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival on 10 February 2014. Reception A Long Way Down received negative reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 22%, based on 50 reviews, with an average score of 4.2/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"Tonally jumbled and conceptually ill- advised, A Long Way Down bungles its source material and wastes a talented cast.\\". At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 34, based on 21 reviews, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\".

The book is about the South African government's banning and subsequent unbanning of Gordimer's 1979 novel Burger's Daughter. The book was published in Johannesburg by Taurus Publications, a small underground publishing house established in the late-1970s to print anti-apartheid literature and other material South African publishers would avoid for fear of censorship. Its publications were generally distributed privately or sent to bookshops to be given to customers free to avoid attracting the attention of the South African authorities.

The official communiqué by the Director of Publications, Richard Smith stating his reason for banning the book a month after publication is reproduced here in full. These charges include \\"propagating Communist opinions\\", \\"creating a psychosis of revolution and rebellion\\", and \\"making several unbridled attacks against the authority entrusted with the maintenance of law and order and the safety of the state\\". In another essay by Gordimer, \\"What the Book is About\\", she responds to each of the charges, showing how, by extensively quoting out of context, the Publications Control Board displayed their \\"inability ... to pass qualified judgment\\" on the book. The reasons for lifting the ban by the Publications Appeal Board three months later, on the recommendation of a panel of literary experts and a state security specialist, are also reproduced here. The state security specialist had reported that the book posed no threat to the security of South Africa, and the literary experts had accused the censorship board \\"of bias, prejudice, and literary incompetence\\", and that \\"[i]t has not read accurately, it has severely distorted by quoting extensively out of context, it has not considered the work as a literary work deserves to be considered, and it has directly, and by implication, smeared the authoress .\\" In the final essay in the book University of the Witwatersrand law professor John Dugard examines censorship in South Africa within the country's legal framework. Reception In a review published in World Literature Today, Carrol Lasker wrote that in What Happened to Burger's Daughter, Gordimer investigates the \\"sinister implications of the practice of banning and unbanning\\", and described the book as \\"a dramatic, detailed and useful model\\" of the workings of censorship in South Africa. Writing in Research in African Literatures, Sheila Roberts said that the book \\"exposes in a thorough and unprecedented way the bungling and ignorance of a censorship committee\\" and its \\"pathetic face- saving efforts\\" to undo the damage it had done.

Early life Powditch was born in 1795 in Tynemouth, Northumberland, England. He commanded the Royal George that brought Thomas Brisbane, the incoming Governor of New South Wales, to Sydney in 1821 and accompanied George Arthur, the incoming Lieutenant Governor of Van Diemen's Land on his trip to Tasmania in 1824. In the early 1820s, he was living in Australia's Hunter Valley. On 19 June 1823, he married Anne Walsh at Bloomsbury, County of Middlesex, England. New Zealand He was a trader in the Bay of Islands when the Postmaster-General of New South Wales appointed him in 1831 \\"to receive and return mail\\"; this was the first postal service between Australia and New Zealand. In 1845, Powditch moved to Auckland. In the first elections to the Auckland Provincial Council on 22 July 1853, he was elected in the Pensioner Settlements electorate. He also stood for election to Parliament in the electorate but was unsuccessful. He represented the Pensioner Settlements electorate until February 1856 when he resigned, and again from April 1857 to September 1861. He then represented the Onehunga electorate until September 1865. From November 1857 to September 1865, he was the 2nd Speaker of the Provincial Council, succeeding Thomas Bartley.

The film, co-written and directed by Philipp Stölzl, focuses on an orphan from an 11th-century English town whose mother died of side sickness. The boy vows to study medicine and decides to travel to Persia. The film stars Tom Payne, Ben Kingsley (as physician Avicenna), Stellan Skarsgård, Olivier Martinez, and Emma Rigby in lead roles.  Plot  In Medieval Europe, the Church is fighting against 'black magic'. The medical knowledge of Greek physicians like Hippocrates and Galen had been lost to the medicine of medieval Europe. In 11th-century England, travelling barber surgeons attempted to supply medical care to the ordinary population, often at the risk of the Church persecuting them for witchcraft. Robert Cole has an extraordinary gift, where he can sense when someone left untreated has a terminal illness. He notices this for the first time when he feels it as a little boy when his sick mother is dying of side sickness, a disease of which he was unaware. The young orphan joins an itinerant barber-surgeon who calls himself Barber. Barber teaches him the basics of medieval medicine, with services such as cupping therapy, bloodletting, and dental extraction. Even as an apprentice Rob recognizes the limitations of these simple practices. When Barber suffers from a cataract, Rob consults a Medicus for him. This Jewish doctor completely heals Barber of his cataracts. He learns a little bit of Jewish culture. He speaks with two children, Jesse and Benjamin. There, Rob sees for the first time a world map, and learns of the famous Ibn Sina, who teaches medicine in distant Kakuyid Persia. So he decides to train there to become a physician. During the Islamic Golden Age, the medicine in the medieval Islamic world is far more advanced than in Europe. The doctor, scientist and philosopher Ibn Sina teaches in Isfahan, the most important school for aspiring practitioners in the world at that time. Rob is told Christians are forbidden to enter Muslim lands while Jews are tolerated. Upon arriving in Egypt, Rob therefore circumcises himself and calls himself Jesse ben Benjamin, pretending to be a Jew (Rob is, in fact, a Christian). In a caravan he comes to know Rebecca who reads to him from a book about Aladdin and Sinbad the Sailor. The caravan experiences a sandstorm, so Rob almost dies. When, after arriving to Isfahan, he asks for admission to the hospital and school of Ibn Sina, where he is rejected and thrown out and beaten by guards. Lying in the street with a cut and a concussion he is found by the Guardian, so then he is taken in as a patient. In a bimaristan (hospital) and madrasa (college), he is treated by Ibn Sina and admitted as a student to learn the basics of scientific medicine as well as other sciences and philosophy (including Aristotelian and Islamic philosophy). Rob learns to perform a medical history and medical examination including pulse diagnosis, the leech treatment, the use of opium, including the analgesic effect, and surgical procedures. After the Shah refuses a peace treaty with the Seljuks, the Seljuks send a man infected with the Black Death to deliberately infect the city. Thousands begin to die after being cared for by Ibn Sina and his students. Only by Rob's discovery and rapid application of basic hygienic principles, the plague is overcome. Rob suggests that oriental rat fleas may be the carriers of the Black Death, and with rat poison the pest may be suppressed. Rob is reunited with Rebecca, who has come down with the plague, and is able to bond with her since her husband temporarily abandons the city, leaving her to become sick. Rob nurses her back to health, Rebecca makes a full recovery, and she and Rob become romantically involved and engage in extramarital sex right before Rebecca must return to her husband, who has returned to the city. Rebecca is impregnated as a result, and her husband eventually discovers this, which leads to her being sentenced to death by stoning. The Christian, Jewish and Islamic religions influence the evaluation of medical science, and a conflict is sparked by the ethical assessment of the autopsy on the human body. As a Zoroastrian dies of side sickness, Rob learns from him that Zoroastrianism does not prohibit an adherent from undergoing autopsy after death. Rob secretly performs an autopsy on his body to deepen his knowledge of anatomy and to discover the inflamed vermiform appendix. When the mullahs discover what he has done, both Rob and Ibn Sina are being sentenced to death for necromancy. Rebecca is about to be stoned for adultery, when the Shah is apparently stricken with side sickness. Rob and Ibn Sina are freed so that Rob will perform an appendectomy, using anesthesia, on the Shah. Before beginning the surgery, Rob arranges for Rebecca to be rescued from her impending execution. Isfahan is betrayed by the mullahs to the Seljuks, since they want to drive the Jewish community and Ibn Sina's madrasa out of the city. Mullah soldiers then arrive to attack the hospital. Ibn Sina heads to the burning library and transfers his medical writings to Rob Cole, and also awards him the medical title 'Hakim.' Ibn Sina then stays to die in the burning library. Rob Cole, as well as others, escape through a gate the Shah has told them about while he and his men go to make a last stand against the Seljuks. Rob returns with Rebecca, as his wife, to London and establishes a hospital. The old Barber, Cole's first teacher, learns from a little boy about his former pupil's return and fame. The Barber then asks the boy to take him to see his old pupil as the film ends.

The film is directed by Jon Wright and produced by Piers Tempest. The estimated budget was $21 million. Plot Not long after the invasion and occupation of Earth by a race of powerful robots wanting human knowledge and ingenuity, humans are confined to their homes. Leaving without permission would be to risk their lives. Monitored by the electronic implants in their necks, the robot sentries are able to track the movement of humans in order to control them. If any person attempts to exit their home, they are given warnings by the robot sentries to return their home. If he or she does not comply within ten seconds, they are killed. At the beginning of the film, a teen going by the name of Sean Flynn (Callan McAuliffe), is seeking his father, who went missing not long after the robots invaded, sending out hand- drawn lost posters hidden in tennis balls and fruit. Later, Nathan, a friend of Sean's, is seen attempting to repair his PlayStation, when Connor, a young boy, accidentally shocks Nathan, while a girl named Alexandra watches. The group discovers that Nathan's implant has been turned off by the electrical shock, and then perform the same procedure on each other to stay outside without being tracked down. The group enters a local museum before Sean suggests that they go look for his father, Danny (Steven Mackintosh) at the school, where the files on all the people are kept. They discover that Danny is still alive, having been moved to a hotel, but are then caught and brought to a room with a deep scanner after their implants reboot. Here, Robin Smythe (Ben Kingsley) asks them how they turned off their implants. When they refuse to answer, Sean's uncle is brought in, and receives a black implant, before being subjected to a deep scan, a painful process that searches through all of a person's mental faculties before rendering them unable to eat, causing them to die in a few days. When the children still refuse to answer, Sean is also given a black implant before being subjected to a deep scan. In the midst of it, Sean insults Smythe, causing him to accidentally interrupt the deep scan, allowing Sean to escape the deep scanner alive. A few seconds later, Connor, who had been left outside, bursts in with a makeshift fireworks launcher and frees the other children. The children hide in a bowling alley, where they turn off their implants once again before running to the hotel. When a large robot walks by, the four children hide next to a doorway, where Sean inadvertently controls the robot. The children then meet Monique, a woman who wants to know how to turn off the implants. In exchange, the boys meet Morse Code Martin (Roy Hudd), who has had his implant removed by a watchmaker, and also tells the children to go to Stonehenge. However, an announcement reveals that Sean's mother, Kate, has been taken a prisoner in the area headquarters, a castle. With Monique's help, the children successfully get to the castle. However, they are caught by a large robot. Sean then discovers that he can take control of the robots because of his black implant, after discovering that the large robot responds to his movement. Meanwhile, Smythe is speaking with Kate about how he and she could live together before an alarm goes off. Smythe leaves to go see what has happened. A few moments later, a young guard is tricked into giving the keys to the door to Kate. Meanwhile, outside, Sean appears to have been caught by the large robot, with Smythe scolding him. Sean then turns the large robot's weapon on Smythe and his team, forcing them to drop their weapons, which are picked up by the other children. Kate suddenly dashes by on a horse, causing Smythe and his team to follow. This opens the line of fire for two clankers, insectoid robots with a top-mounted weapon, which destroy the large robot, forcing Sean to hide behind it. One of the clankers then jumps down and prepares to fire at Sean, before Sean takes control of the robot and uses it to destroy the other, before commanding the clanker to deactivate. The children then track down Kate, before heading to Stonehenge, deciphering a message written in graffiti to find the location of a human camp, an old tin mine. Meanwhile, Smythe is told by Mediator 452, a recurring character in the film, that a large number of deep scanners are arriving and that Smythe will be the first to be scanned if Sean is not captured by the time that they arrive. Sean and his friends are seen arriving at the human camp, where Sean is reunited with his father. The small group has their implants removed. The next day, the robots descend on the community seeking Sean, who is quickly discovered to be missing. Sean is seen reinstalling his black implant, before mentally controlling a robot craft that rams and destroys the cube, the local robot mothership, halting the invasion. He narrowly escapes the impact. He interfaces with a damaged Mediator, a robot in human form, and mentally sends commands to end the invasion of the Earth, destroying the robots and their craft. The film ends with jubilation as the local population celebrates in town. In the closing scene, Sean looks up at the stars.

The film is based on the real events of the 2010 mining disaster, in which a group of thirty-three miners were trapped inside the San José Mine in Chile for 69 days. The film stars Antonio Banderas as trapped miner Mario Sepúlveda. Plot Dozens of people from Copiapó, Chile, work in the San José mine. The owner ignores the warnings of the failing stability of the mine, which collapses a short time later. The only path inside the mine is completely blocked, and the thirty-three miners manage to get to the rescue chamber. They discover that the radio is useless, the medical kit is empty, the ventilation shafts lack the required ladders, and there is very little stored food. Mario Sepúlveda becomes the leader of the miners, dividing the foods rations and stopping the outbursts of violence and despair. The mine company does not attempt any rescue, and the relatives of the miners gather around the gates. The government of Chile decides on active intervention, and orders the use of drills to reach the chamber. The first exploratory boreholes move off-target, but a later one reaches the required destination. The miners attach a note to the drill bit to announce their survival. They receive new food and clothing, and television communication with the surface. A second, bigger, drill system is prepared to retrieve the miners one by one. There is drama and tension during the weeks before the successful rescue of all 33 miners, over two months after they became trapped. The story is derived from the August 2010 mine collapse and subsequent rescues in Copiapó, Chile.

It is directed by Patricia Riggen and written by Mikko Alanne and José Rivera.

Antonio Banderas, who portrays \\"Super\\" Mario Sepúlveda, is the public face for the miners who sent videos to the rescuers to update them on the miners' condition. The actual Sepúlveda expressed his enthusiasm and approval towards having Banderas in the role. Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro plays Laurence Golborne, Minister of Mining. On 17 June 2013, it was announced that Jennifer Lopez had joined to lead the cast of the film, but later left due to scheduling conflicts with American Idol. She was replaced by Juliette Binoche. On 10 January 2014, Cote de Pablo joined the cast of the film; she plays the wife of one of the trapped miners. On 27 January 2014, Gabriel Byrne joined the cast of the film, to play the role of Andre Sougarret, the engineering genius who masterminded the miraculous rescue of the 33 trapped miners. Next day on 28 January, Bob Gunton joined the cast of the Chilean miner filming, then shooting in Colombia; he plays the role of Chilean President Sebastián Piñera. Filming Principal photography began in December 2013 in Colombia. Before shooting began, Riggen interviewed each of the miners and their families. After the shooting wrapped up in Nemocón, Colombia in January, crews started filming again in Copiapó, Chile on 5 February 2014, which was the actual place of the incident. On 18 February 2014, news told that more than half of the filming was done in the salt mine of Nemocón, Colombia, and rescue scenes were being filmed in Tierra Amarilla, Chile. Filming wrapped up on 20 February 2014. Music In October 2014, James Horner was hired to compose the music for the film.

On the same day, Warner Bros, where Alcon has its output deal, set the film's release date for 13 November 2015. Reception Box office According to Box Office Mojo The 33 grossed $12.2 million in North America and $12.7 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $24.9 million, against its production budget of $26 million. The data is inaccurate though since Box Office Mojo e.g. for the UK and Germany only has data for the first weekend and data for France is missing completely even though the film has been released in the country.https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&id;=33.htmhttps://www.francetvinfo.fr/culture/cinema/un- film-racontant-leur-epreuve-divise-les-33-mineurs-chiliens_3285453.html In North America, The 33 opened alongside Love the Coopers and My All American on 13 November 2015 with a very poor performance. In its opening weekend, the film was projected to gross $7–8 million from 2,452 theaters. The film grossed $1.8 million on its opening day and $5.8 million in its opening weekend, finishing below studio projections. In Chile, the film grossed $1.6 million on its opening weekend, 6 August 2015, showing on 140 screens. This is the second biggest opening for a Chilean film (5% behind Stefan v/s Kramer), despite coinciding with a severe storm that caused flooding in Santiago and other parts of the country and also marked the sixth-highest opening for Fox International Productions. It topped the box office there for five consecutive weekends and became the second highest-grossing Chilean film. The film grossed a total of $4.9 million in Chile. In Mexico it opened at No. 3 with $1.3 million, but ended up grossing only a total of $3 million there after three weeks in release. Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 43% based on 124 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"The 33 offers an appropriately inspirational account of real-life heroism, but its stirring story and solid performances are undermined by a flawed focus and an overreliance on formula.\\" On Metacritic, the film has received a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of \\"A–\\" on an A+ to F scale. Scott Tobias of Variety said, \\"The 33 aims for a comprehensive survey of efforts above ground and below, but winds up looking less like a sober docudrama than a ginned-up Irwin Allen disaster movie.\\" Chilean critics had mixed reviews. Ana Josefa Silva gave a mildly positive review, saying that the movie \\"excites and entertains\\", but that the good rhythm of the first half becomes stalled. She praised the acting, but criticized the use of many clichés, like the heroic young character (Golborne), the \\"inhumane\\" politician (Piñera) or the brave, \\"badass\\" Latina woman (Segovia). Las Últimas Noticias stated that \\"while the epic of the rescue is observed thanks to the effective recreation, the agony of the rescued remains in debt in the staging\\", and also noted the \\"young and handsome\\" hero stereotype. La Segunda described it as \\"a catastrophe film with a life message and sentimental vocation that is not willing to give up to truisms associated with the image that Hollywood has of Hispanic America\\". El Mercurio gave a negative review, criticizing the absence of people responsible for the precarious working conditions of the miners, although praising the recreation of the mine and the catastrophe. Accuracy Among the differences between the film and the real life story, Alex Vega was not the first man to be rescued, but Florencio Ávalos. Also, Vega's wife was not pregnant at the time. In the film, the Fénix capsule arrives empty at the rescue chamber, but actually there was a rescuer inside of it. The capsule did not get stuck with a miner inside; André Sougarret did not order the end of the rescue works before the contact with the miners; and María Segovia never slapped Laurence Golborne in the face.

The area is remote, with no public transportation available. TWNC was founded by Tomy Winata, an Indonesian businessman and philanthropist. Owner and chairman of the Artha Graha Group and Network, Winata also founded the nonprofit Artha Graha Peduli Foundation. Since 1996 (followed by a 2010 agreement), TWNC has been funded and managed by the foundation. As part of a July 2008 agreement with the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry, TWNC is part of the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park. History The area has experienced illegal activity, including poaching, illegal fishing and unauthorized logging and land use. As a result of these activities, deforestation in the national park has destroyed about 20 percent of the forest. Coral reefs were damaged by an exponential increase in fishing over an approximately area around the TWNC. Forest, wildlife and marine conservation The Go-Green Society began the foundation’s program to restore TWNC in 1998. The recovery progress was relatively slow because of extensive damage caused by illegal activity in the area, and the foundation spent years reducing and stabilizing the rate of deforestation in the conservation area. Foundation programs and efforts implemented in TWNC include: *Reforestation, planting more than 10,000 trees of endemic species including waru, bayur (Pterospermum javanicum) and nyamplung since 1998 *Assisting Indonesian forest patrols with additional personnel and equipment to protect TWNC Conservation and provide training and information about conservation to villagers surrounding TWNC. *Rescue of Sumatran tigers. According to a 2010 WWF-IUCN estimate, the Sumatran tiger population numbers less than 300. The foundation and TWNC are working with Panthera, an international nongovernmental organisation focused on big cats. Since 1998 the foundation and TWNC have moved eight Sumatran tigers, and five have been returned to their natural habitat. In the TWNC area there are 30–40 Sumatran tigers, which are occasionally photographed. In 2011, three cubs were born in the area to rescued Sumatran tigers. *Return of endangered species, including sea turtles and the Sunda pangolin, to their natural habitats *A program encouraging local residents to support the foundation’s go-green activities, reversing deforestation *A drug-rehabilitation program, employing former addicts in conservation-based activities in cooperation with the National Anti-Narcotics Agency (BNN) to reduce the rate of relapse. The program combines drug rehabilitation with TWNC's conservation work, encouraging former addicts to pursue careers in conservation and ecotourism. The program was presented by Winata at the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) 2013 annual meeting in Vienna. *A limited ecotourism program, providing biodegradable products and tree-planting activities. Forest conservation As indicated by its absence of tigers in conflict, TWNC's natural forest is an example of a complete food chain. Its marine conservation has attracted individual visitors and national and international institutions such as UNESCO, the IUCN, the World Bank, Phantera, and UNODC. In 2012, Kylie Minogue visited Tambling during her visit to Indonesia. Fifteen foreign ambassadors visited TWNC during the 2009 Krakatau Festival. Media outlets, including The New York Times, have visited TWNC. Challenges The mantangan plant (Meremia peltata), a flowering vine in the morning glory family which limits trees' access to sunlight, is an environmental challenge. Another challenge is the loss of TWNC's coastal area. Several areas in TWNC have eroded as much as due to rising sea levels triggered by global warming. Indonesia had comprised 17,508 islands, but the loss of small islands to rising seawater has reduced its total to about 17,400. International support Although it is the third country classified as a \\"lung of the world\\", Indonesia faces a challenge in sustaining funding for its conservation activities. Award On 16 July 2014 TWNC received an award from Panthera for its success in Sumatran tiger conservation at the annual Tigers Forever meeting in Jakarta.

Plot While driving home in a state of intoxication after celebrating winning a court case, ambitious young Chicago District Attorney Mitch Brockden (Dominic Cooper) is accidentally involved in a fatal hit and run. In an effort to preserve his legal career, he covers it up. Clinton Davis (Samuel L. Jackson), a 55-year-old car mechanic (whose wife and child had been killed in a home invasion by a parolee) is arrested for the murder, and has reported ties to a series of other unexplained crimes. Brockden becomes the prosecutor for the case and ensures that Davis is acquitted for the crime. After another man is mysteriously murdered in a similar manner as previous unsolved cases soon after Davis' release, Brockden and Det. Blake Kanon (Gloria Reuben) suspect that Davis is a serial killer who murders parolees in an attempt to prevent them committing further crimes. Brockden searches Davis' house for evidence to prove his suspicions. At the same time, his stepbrother Jimmy Logan (Ryan Robbins) tails Davis to a warehouse. While on the phone with Brockden, Logan is attacked by Davis leaving him in a coma. Brockden is arrested by the police and while in custody, Davis threatens to kill Brockden's wife (Erin Karpluk). He breaks out of prison to stop him. In a confrontation, Brockden is wounded by Davis, but is saved when Detective Kanon fatally shoots Davis.

Scott Foundas of Variety magazine wrote that the film was made \\"...with all the enthusiasm of a career middle-manager dutifully punching a clock.\\" Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter felt the film wasted the time of the audience and commented that Cooper never elicited the audience's sympathy for his character.

Life He was born at Clapham to the south-west of central London, while his father Henry Venn was curate there, on 9 March 1759. He entered Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, graduated B.A. in 1781, and M.A. in 1784. Venn was rector of Little Dunham, Norfolk, from 1783 to 1792, and rector of Clapham from 1792 to his death. He was one of the original founders of the Church Missionary Society in 1797, and was a leading abolitionist and philanthropist. These evangelistic and humanitarian interests brought him into close association with abolitionists such as William Wilberforce and Granville Sharp.See Stephen Tomkins, The Clapham Sect: How Wilberforce's Circle Transformed Britain (Oxford: LionHudson, 2010), 112-118. Michael M. Hennell, John Venn and the Clapham Sect (London: Lutterworth Press, 2003), 176. He ran the school set up by the Society for the Education of Africans which was set up in Clapham in 1799. He died at Clapham on 1 July 1813. A volume of his sermons was published after his death. Some of his friends arranged for the following memorial plaque to be erected on the north side of the church in Clapham: \\"To the memory of the Reverend John Venn, M.A. for twenty years Rector of this parish. He was the son of the Reverend Henry Venn, Vicar of Yelling; and his progenitors, for several generations, were Ministers of the Church of England. He was endowed by providence with a sound and powerful understanding: and he added to an ample fund of classical knowledge a familiar acquaintance with all the more useful parts of philosophy and science: His taste was simple. His disposition was humble and benevolent. His manners were mild and conciliating. As a Divine, he was comprehensive and elevated in his views, and peculiarly conversant with Theological subjects; but he derived his chief knowledge from the scriptures themselves, which he diligently studied and faithfully interpreted. As a Preacher, he was affectionate and persuasive, intellectual and discriminating, serious, solemn, and devout; anxious to impress on others those evangelical truths which he himself so deeply felt. By his Family, among whom he was singularly beloved, his remembrance will be cherished with peculiar tenderness. Having been sustained, during a long and trying illness, by a stedfast faith in that Saviour whom in all his preaching he laboured to exalt, he died 1 July 1813, aged 54 years, leaving to his surviving family and flock an encouraging example of the blessedness of those who embrace with their whole hearts the religion of Jesus Christ.\\"Clapham with its Common and Environs; containing an Historical and Topographical Description of the Parish and Manor, principally extracted from parochial documents (Clapham: David Batten, 1841), 83. Family Venn married first, at Trinity Church, Hull, on 22 October 1789, Catherine (1760–1803), only daughter of William King, merchant, of Kingston upon Hull. By her he had sons Henry Venn, and John, for many years vicar of St. Peter's, Hereford; also five daughters, of whom Jane, the second, married James Stephen, and was mother of James Fitzjames Stephen and Leslie Stephen; and Caroline married Stephen Ellis Batten and was mother of Emelia Russell Gurney. He married, secondly, on 25 August 1812, Frances, daughter of John Turton of Clapham. Venn was the father of Henry Venn (1796-1873), honorary secretary of the Church Missionary Society, and grandfather of logician and philosopher John Venn, who compiled a family history in 1904.

Its territory stretched from Tlemcen to the Chelif bend and Algiers, and reached at its zenith the Moulouya River to the west, Sijilmasa to the south and the Soummam to the east.The Abdelwadids (1236–1554), on qantara-med.orgL'Algérie au passé lointain – De Carthage à la Régence d'Alger, p175 The Tlemcen Kingdom was established after the demise of the Moroccan Almohad Caliphate in 1236, and later fell under Ottoman rule in 1554. It was ruled by sultans of the Zayyanid dynasty. The capital of the Tlemcen kingdom was centered at Tlemcen, which lay on the main east-west route between Morocco and Ifriqiya. The Kingdom of Fez was centered at Fez, to the west of Tlemcen. Tlemcen was also a hub on the north-south trade route from Oran on the Mediterranean coast to the Western Sudan. As a prosperous trading center, it attracted its more powerful neighbors. At different times the Moroccans from the west, denizens of Ifriqiya from the east, and Aragonese from the north, invaded and occupied the kingdom. Foundation The Bānu ʿabd āl-Wād, also called the Bānu Ziyān or Zayyanids after Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan, the founder of the dynasty, were leaders of a Berber group who had long been settled in the Central Maghreb. Although contemporary chroniclers asserted that they had a noble origin, little is known for sure. The town of Tlemcen, called Pomaria by the Romans, is about above sea level in fertile, well-watered country. Tlemcen was an important center under the Almoravid dynasty and its successors the Almohad Caliphate, who began a new wall around the town in 1161. Yaghmurasen ibn Zayyan (1235–83) of the Bānu ʿabd āl-Wād was governor of Tlemcen under the Almohads. He inherited leadership of the family from his brother in 1235. When the Almohad empire began to fall apart, in 1235, Yaghmurasen declared his independence. The city of Tlemcen became the capital of one of three successor states, ruled for centuries by successive Ziyyanid sultans. Its flag was a white crescent pointing upwards on a blue field. The kingdom covered the less fertile regions of the Tell Atlas. Its people included a minority of settled farmers and villagers, and a majority of nomadic herders. Yaghmurasen was able to maintain control over the rival Berber groups, and when faced with the outside threat of the Marinid dynasty, he formed an alliance with the Sultan of Granada and the King of Castile, Alfonso X. According to Ibn Khaldun, \\"he was the bravest, most dreaded and honorable man of the 'Abd-la-Wadid family. No one looked after the interest of his people, maintained the influence of the kingdom and managed the state administration better than he did.\\" Before his death he instructed his son and heir Uthman to remain on the defensive with the Marinid kingdom, but to expand into Hafsid territory if possible. Under Yaghmurasen's leadership, and later under Abu Hammu II (1359–89), the kingdom pursued an expansionary policy, pushing towards Fez in the west and into the Chelif valley and Béjaïa in the east.  List of Sultans of the Kingdom of Tlemcen  Economy Great Mosque of Tlemcen. Built under Almoravid sultan Yusuf ibn Tashfin, Sultan Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan (1236-1283), founder of the Zayyanid dynasty added a section with a minaret and a dome in the 13th century. The city of Tlemcen displaced Tahert (Tiaret) as the main trading hub in the central Maghreb, lying on the west-east route between Fez and Ifriqiya. Another major route from Oran ran south through Tlemcen to the oases of the Sahara, and onward to the Western Sudan region to the south. The city was directly linked to Sijilmasa, which served as the main northern hub for the trade routes that crossed the desert to the Western Sudanese markets. Oran, a port that the Andalusians had founded in the tenth century to handle the trade with Tahert, came to serve Tlemcen in its trade with Europe. Fez was nearer to Sijilmasa than Tlemcen, but the route to Fez led over the Atlas mountains, while the route to Tlemcen was easier for the caravans. Yaghmurasan made an attempt to capture Sijilmasa in 1257, and succeeded in 1264, holding the town for almost ten years. The Marinids then took Sijilmasa, but most of the trade continued to flow through Tlemcen. The city of Tlemcen became an important center, with many schools, mosques and palaces. Tlemcen also housed a European trading center (funduk) which connected African and European merchants. In particular, Tlemcen was one of the points through which African gold (arriving from south of the Sahara via Sijilmasa or Taghaza) entered the European hands. Consequently, Tlemcen was partially integrated into the European financial system. So, for example, Genoese bills of exchange circulated there, at least among merchants not subject to (or not deterred by) religious prohibitions. Tlemcen housed several well-known madrasas and numerous wealthy religious foundations, becoming the principal intellectual center of the central Maghreb. At the souq around the Great Mosque, merchants sold woolen fabrics and rugs from the East, slaves and gold from across the Sahara, local earthenware and leather goods, and a variety of Mediterranean maritime goods \\"redirected\\" to Tlemcen by corsairs—in addition to the intentional European imports available at the funduk. Merchant houses based in Tlemcen, such as the al-Maqqari maintained regular branch offices in Mali and the Sudan. The ruler of Tlemcen is reported to have been advised by a Jewish viceroy named Abraham, who, in the time of the Inquisition of Torquemada, opened the gates of Tlemcen to Jewish and Muslim refugees fleeing Spain. Abraham is said to have supported them with his own money and with the tolerance of the king of Tlemcen. 14th century - political turmoil Columns from the Mansura mosque For most of its history the kingdom was on the defensive, threatened by stronger states to the east and the west. The nomadic Arabs to the south also took advantage of the frequent periods of weakness to raid the center and take control of pastures in the south. The city of Tlemcen was several times attacked or besieged by the Marinids of Morocco, and large parts of the kingdom were occupied by the Moroccans for several decades in the fourteenth century. The Marinid Abu Yaqub Yusuf an-Nasr besieged Tlemcen from 1299 to 1307. During the siege he built a new town, al-Mansura, diverting most of the trade to this town. The new city was fortified and had a mosque, baths and palaces. The siege was raised when Abu Yakub was murdered in his sleep by one of his eunuchs. Abu Yakub was succeeded by his sons Abu Thabit and Abu Rabi between 1307 and 1310, and then by his brother Abu Sa'id Uthman II, who came to the throne in 1310. Abu Sa'id was distracted by revolts of his son Abu Ali, the governor of Sijilmasa. Abu Sa'id died in 1331. His son Abu al-Hasan 'Ali (r. 1331–1351), the greatest Marinid Sultan, ended the internal quarrels and initiated an expansionary program. When the Marinids left in 1307, the Zayyanids promptly destroyed al- Mansura. Tlemcen recovered its trade and its population grew, reaching about 40,000 by around the 1330s. The Zayyanid king Abu Zayyan I died in 1308 and was succeeded by Abu Hammu I (r. 1308-1318). Abu Hammu was killed in a conspiracy instigated by his son and heir Ibn Tashufin (r. 1318-1337), who initiated hostilities against Ifriqiya while the Marinids were distracted by their internal struggles. Ibn Tashufin besieged Béjaïa, and sent an army into Tunisia that defeated the Hafsid king Abu Yahya Abu Bakr II, who fled to Constantine while the Zayyanids occupied Tunis. The Marinid empire at its greatest extent, around 1348. Tlemcen ruled by the Marinids from 1337 to 1358. A Hafsid princess had married Sultan Abu'l Hasan of Fez, and the Hafsids appealed to him for help, providing a welcome excuse for invading his neighbor. Abu'l Hasan initiated a siege of Tlemcen in 1335, and the city fell in 1337. Ibn Tashufin died during the fighting. Abu'l Hasan received delegates from Egypt, Granada, Tunis and Mali congratulating him on his victory, by which he had gained complete control of the trans-Saharan trade. In 1346 the Hafsid Sultan, Abu Bakr, died and a dispute over the succession ensued. In 1347 Abu'l Hasan annexed Ifriqiya, briefly reuniting the Maghrib territories as they had been under the Almohads. However, Abu'l Hasan went too far in attempting to impose more authority over the Arab tribes, who revolted and in April 1348 defeated his army near Kairouan. His son, Abu Inan Faris, who had been serving as governor of Tlemcen, returned to Fez and declared that he was sultan. Tlemcen and the central Maghreb revolted. The Zayyanid Abu Sa'id Uthman II (1348-1352) was proclaimed king of Tlemcen. Abu'l Hasan had to return from Ifriqiya by sea. After failing to retake Tlemcen and being defeated by his son, Abu'l Hasan died in May 1351. In 1352 Abu Inan Faris recaptured Tlemcen. He also reconquered the central Maghreb. He took Béjaïa in 1353 and Tunis in 1357, becoming master of Ifrikiya. In 1358 he was forced to return to Fez due to Arab opposition, where he feel sick and was killed. The Zayyanid king Abu Hammu Musa II (r. 1359-1389) next took the throne of Tlemcen. He had a long reign punctuated by fighting against the Marinids or various rebel groups. The Marinids reoccupied Tlemcen in 1360 and in 1370. In both cases, the Marinids found they were unable to hold the region against local resistance. The historian Ibn Khaldun lived in Tlemcen for a period during the generally prosperous reign of Abu Hammu Musa II, and helped him in negotiations with the nomadic Arabs. He said of this period, \\"Here [in Tlemcen] science and arts developed with success; here were born scholars and outstanding men, whose glory penetrated into other countries.\\" Abu Hammu was deposed by his son, Abu Tashfin II (1389–94), and the state went into decline. Disintegration and fall A man of Tlemcen In the 15th century, expansion eastward was attempted, but proved disastrous. The state was increasingly weak and became intermittently a vassal of Hafsid Ifriqiya, Marinid Morocco or the Crown of Aragon. By the end of the fifteenth century the Kingdom of Aragon had gained effective political control, intervening in the dynastic disputes of the amirs of Tlemcen, whose authority had shrunk to the town and its immediate neighborhood. When the Spanish took the city of Oran from the kingdom in 1509, continuous pressure from the Berbers prompted the Spanish to attempt a counterattack against the city of Tlemcen (1543), which was deemed by the Papacy to be a crusade. The Spanish failed to take the city in the first attack, but the strategic vulnerability of Tlemcen caused the kingdom's weight to shift toward the safer and more heavily fortified corsair base at Algiers. Tlemcen was captured in 1554 by the Ottoman Empire under Salih Reis, the Pasha of Algiers. The last sultan's son escaped to Oran, then a Spanish possession. He was baptized and lived a quiet life as Don Carlos at the court of Philip II of Spain. Under the Ottoman Empire the town quickly lost its former importance, becoming a sleepy provincial town. The failure of the kingdom to become a powerful state can be explained by the lack of geographical or cultural unity, the constant internal disputes and the reliance on Arab nomads for the military.

Background  Hannah was bred by the Rothschild family and named for Baron Meyer Rothschild’s only daughter. She was sired by King Tom (champion sire and son of influential broodmare Pocahontas) and 1000 Guineas winner Mentmore Lass, who was one of the Rothchild’s foundation mares and also produced Zephyr, dam of Derby winner Favonius.http://www.tbheritage.com/Portraits/Radium.html Hannah was a slender bay filly, light of bone, and was put into training with Joseph Hayhoe.  Racing career  1870: two-year-old season  Hannah was still unnamed (as was permitted for juveniles) when she made her debut in the July Stakes at Newmarket. She duly won by half a length from General (who later won the Criterion Stakes), before going on to win the Triennial Produce Stakes by two lengths and Clearwell Stakes by one and a half lengths. The following day, Hannah finished third to Albert Victor and Steppe in the Middle Park Plate after trying to concede them 7 lbs in weight. She finished off her two-year- old campaign two days later in the Prendergast Stakes, where she finished second by a head to Digby Grand. 1871: three-year-old season  Hannah reappeared in the following year’s 1000 Guineas, where she was sent off the 2/1 favourite and won easily by three lengths from Steppe. She next stepped up to a mile and a half for the Oaks, where she was again three lengths too good for her rivals. Hannah then raced in the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Ascot, where she was third to the Derby second King Of The Forest and Ripponden as the 4/1 favourite after trying to concede 11 lbs. She then attempted to emulate Formosa in winning the St Leger and the Fillies Triple Crown. Up against nine rivals, including Middle Park Plate conqueror Albert Victor (who also dead heated for second in the Derby), Hannah was sent off the 9/4 favourite and won by a length. By winning the St Leger, Hannah ensured that her owner, Baron de Rothschild had won all five Classic races (he had won the Derby with Favonius). 1868 became known as “the Baron’s Year”. Hannah went on to win the Triennial Produce Stakes in a walkover, before finishing third to Verdure in the Newmarket Oaks in her final race of the season. 1872: four- year-old season  Hannah won only twice the following season, by a head in two runner renewal of the two mile Ascot Triennial Stakes, and by three lengths in her third Triennial Produce Stakes at Newmarket. She was also third in the Ascot Gold Cup to Monarque and stablemate Favonius, and fifth in the Cambridgeshire to Playfair (receiving nearly 3 stone in weight). 1873: five-year-old season  Hannah was well past the peak of her classic winning season by age five, and again only won twice in nine starts in two handicaps. She also finished fourth in the City and Suburban Handicap to Mornington, second in the Gold Vase to Thorn, and last of seven in the Ascot Gold Cup behind Cremorne. In her last appearance on a racecourse, Hannah was third to Flageolet in the Jockey Club Cup.  Retirement  Hannah was retired to stud after her five-year-old season, where she produced the colt Holmby before miscarrying twins and dying in November 1875 at the age of seven.  Assessment  Although she was the best filly of her generation, Hannah’s trainer Hayhoe rated her Derby winner stablemate Favonius 16 lbs superior to her. She was also considered by her connections to be of similar ability her stablemate Corisande, winner of the Coronation Stakes and Cesarewitch.

The Yurok are the largest Native American tribe in the U.S. state of California, with approximately 6,000 members. Thompson was the oldest living Yurok and the last known native-born, active speaker of the Yurok language at the time of his death in 2013. He was the last of about twenty Yurok elders who worked to revitalize the Yurok language. He worked with academics and linguists to preserve and revitalize the language among younger Yurok generations throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Those same linguists had originally predicted that Yurok would be extinct by 2010 and Thompson received much of the credit for saving the language. Yurok is now taught in five high schools throughout Humboldt and Del Norte counties in northern California. While the language is still endangered, the effort to preserve Yurok is considered to be the most successful revitalization effort in California. Childhood Thompson was born in a smokehouse on May 26, 1919, in Wa'tek Village (now known as Johnsons, California) in Humboldt County. He was sent to a government school in Hoopa, California, when he was five years old, where he was discouraged from speaking Yurok. He returned home when he was eight years old, but his mother soon tried to put him up for adoption. He was taken in by his grandmother, Rosie Jack Hoppell. Thompson was raised by his grandmother, who only spoke Yurok in her home, and his uncle. His relatives raised him in a traditional Yurok lifestyle. As a child, Thompson trapped ducks to fill feather mattresses, harvested seaweed, fished for eulachon and salmon, and tracked elk. Education and military service Thompson earned varsity letters in football, basketball, baseball and track at Del Norte High School in Crescent City, California, from which he graduated in 1939. Thompson was one of the first Native American students to have his name engraved on the Del Norte H.S. Coach's Cup, a school award which honors exception skills in multiple athletic sports. He attended the Sherman Institute, a Native American boarding school in Riverside, California, (now known as Sherman Indian High School) where he learned welding. He served in the United States Navy during World War II and was sent to the South Pacific. Personal life Thompson and his wife, Alta McCash, a member of the Karuk people, moved to Crescent City in 1959. The couple had eight children before Alta died from complications of a fall in 1968. Honors In 2009, Thompson was awarded the Silver Honor in the Mentor Category from the MetLife Foundation and the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging at a ceremony held in Washington D.C. Death and legacy Archie Thompson died from a stroke at a hospital in Crescent City on March 26, 2013, at the age of 93. He was survived by seven children, twenty- nine grandchildren, seventy-two great-grandchildren, and four great-great- grandchildren.

It is produced and distributed by Estrima, an Italian company located in Pordenone. It belongs to the category of electric mopeds, in particular to light quadricycle mopeds. In some countries it is legally comparable to a moped: its maximum speed is and can go up to with a minor controller update. In Italy it can be driven from the age of 14 with a driver's license. History Estrima is a startup company established in Pordenone in 2008 by its president, Matteo Maestri, with the intention of evolving the experience of the family corporation Brieda Srl into new emerging sectors. The goal of Estrima is to reduce urban mobility problems such as traffic congestion and pollution by creating the smallest four-wheel electric vehicle on the market, the Birò. Production of the vehicle started in June 2009, and in 2010 and 2011 Birò was the most registered electric vehicle in Italy among the categories of 2, 3, and 4 wheels. At the end of 2012, Red Circle Investments, the company of the Rosso family, acquired 30% of the shares of Estrima. Features Aesthetic Birò is the smallest four-wheel electric vehicle on the market; it is wide and long. The vehicle has a reinforced dark-green roof and rear glass, a roomy compartment, a headrest, and an armrest. The roof can be opened for ventilation. Available options are kit doors, radio pre-installation and an external trunk trolley. The Birò has much larger windows than other microcars, resulting in better visibility for the driver and more appealing looks of the car. The structure of the Birò is made of 3 mm thick tubular steel, protecting the driver and the passenger. Technical The very low center of gravity of Birò ensures stability and a good road grip. The Birò is driven by two brushless 48 V electric motors, mounted directly in the rear wheels, producing a total of 4 kW of power. Thanks to the electric motors it has great pickup power that can be increased further by pulling the \\"boost\\" lever. For the Birò two different kinds of batteries are available, a pure lead battery and a lithium battery. Depending on the type of battery, the Birò has a range of about 40 or 70 km, varying according to temperature, driving style, travel type and weight. Consumption # On a low-range or urban cycle, with many start-stop process, the Biro uses 78 Wh/km. # On a mid-range or combined usage, mixing urban traffic and driving open roads, consumption decreases to 64 Wh/km. # On a maximum-range, or extra-urban trip, with open roads, including hills, provided the \\"Boost\\" function is not used it can achieve 55 Wh/km. On the maximum range, if a consumption indicator has been installed, the Ah consumed is the same as the kilometres travelled (25 Ah = 25 km). Power The current used by the Birò for normal operations is restricted to a maximum of 80 A with a voltage ranging from 36 V to 53 V. A so-called boost function can be selected for uphill driving. When this function is used the current can temporarily be increased to a restricted maximum of 130 A. # The \\"boost\\" function is restricted as the normal current by the temperature sensor on each motor and by the \\"36V\\" low alert voltage. # At 36 V, the Biro controllers restrict the current to \\"stay at 36V\\" ... the speed and torque decrease dramatically (it's not a \\"reserve indicator\\"). # The \\"reserve\\" way of the Biro it's more like you feel a low torque because of the decrease of the voltage of the battery. During normal operation the \\"in drive\\" voltage is 48 V (in 80 A mode) or 46 V (in 130 A mode). On \\"reserve\\" range, the voltage is 45 V (80 A) and 43 V (130 A) so, at that point, one must find a way to quickly reach a point of recharge.

Rather than containing a clapper, bonshō are struck from the outside, using either a handheld mallet or a beam suspended on ropes. The bells are usually made from bronze, using a form of expendable mould casting. They are typically augmented and ornamented with a variety of bosses, raised bands and inscriptions. The earliest of these bells in Japan date to around 600 CE, although the general design is of much earlier Chinese origin and shares some of the features seen in ancient Chinese bells. The bells' penetrating and pervasive tone carries over considerable distances, which led to their use as signals, timekeepers and alarms. In addition, the sound of the bell is thought to have supernatural properties; it is believed, for example, that it can be heard in the underworld. The spiritual significance of bonshō means that they play an important role in Buddhist ceremonies, particularly the New Year and Bon festivals. Throughout Japanese history these bells have become associated with stories and legends, both fictional, such as the Benkei Bell of Mii-dera, and historical, such as the bell of Hōkō-ji. In modern times, bonshō have become symbols of world peace. Origin The bonshō is derived from the bianzhong (' in Japanese), an ancient Chinese court instrument comprising a series of tuned bells. One larger additional bell, which eventually developed into the bonshō, was used as a tuning device and a summons to listeners to attend a bianzhong recital. According to legend, the earliest bonshō may have come from China to Japan via the Korean Peninsula. The Nihon Shoki records that Ōtomo no Satehiko brought three bronze bells back to Japan in 562 as spoils of war from Goguryeo. Construction One of the bells at Mii-dera being sounded by a shu-moku Bonshō are cast in a single piece using two moulds, a core and a shell, in a process that is largely unchanged since the Nara period (710–794). The core is constructed from a dome of stacked bricks made from hardened sand, whilst the shell is made using a strickle board. This is a large, flat, wooden board shaped like a cross-section of the bell, which is rotated around a vertical axis to shape the clay used for the mould. Inscriptions and decorations are then carved or impressed into the clay. The shell fits over the core to create a narrow gap, into which the molten bronze is poured at a temperature of over . The ratio of the alloy is usually around 17:3 copper to tin; the exact admixture (as well as the speed of the cooling process) can alter the tone of the end product. After the metal has cooled and solidified, the mould is removed by breaking it, therefore a new one has to be created for each bell. The process has a high failure rate; only around 50 per cent of castings are successful on the first attempt, without cracks or imperfections. Diagram showing the various parts of a Japanese temple bellThe casting is traditionally accompanied by the chanting of Buddhist sutras, which may go on for several hours. Buddhist prayer papers, sprigs of sacred mulberry and other ceremonial offerings are added to the molten bronze during the founding process. There are several parts to a temple bell: * , the dragon-shaped handle at the top of the bell, by which it is carried or hung * , the domed crown of the bell * , bosses around the upper part of the bell that improve its resonance * , lower rim * , striking panel, a reinforced spot where the bell is struck. It is often decorated with a Buddhist lotus motif. * , decorative horizontal bands * , inscription (often giving the bell's history) * , the hanging wooden beam used to strike the tsuki-za Some bells retain linear impressions arising from joints in the mould used; they are not removed during fettling but are regarded as an aspect of the bell's overall beauty. The bell's appearance and sound are intended to be in keeping with Japan's wabi-sabi aesthetic. Sound Japanese temple bells are struck externally with either a hammer or a suspended beam rather than with an internal clapper. The sound of the bell is made up of three parts. First is the atari, the impact of the strike. A well-made bell should produce a clean, clear tone. The initial sound of the strike is immediately followed by the prolonged oshi, the reverberation that continues to sound after the bell is struck. This is higher in pitch and is a low rumble with a sorrowful air, rich in harmonics; it lasts for up to ten seconds. Finally comes the okuri or decay, the resonance that is heard as the vibration of the bell dies away, which can last up to a minute. There are also continuous harmonic overtones heard throughout the tolling of the bell. These multiple tones create a complex pitch profile. The low tone and deep resonance of the bell allow the sound to carry over great distances; a large bonshō can be heard up to away on a clear day. The pitch of the bell is carefully judged by its creators, and a difference of a single hertz in the fundamental frequency can require that the bell be recast from scratch. Function and significance Bonshō are sited in Buddhist temples, usually in a specially designated building or tower called a . They are used to mark the passage of time, and to call the monks to liturgical services. In Buddhism, the bell's sound is considered to be calming and to induce a suitable atmosphere for meditation. Because of their shape (with sloped shoulders and a flat base) the bells are seen as representations of the sitting Buddha, and are accorded similar respect; those striking the bell will first make three bows towards it, just as they would before a statue of Buddha. The sonorous sound of the bell was also used to warn of impending typhoons and as a general alert. Because the ringing of a temple bell could be heard over considerable distances, it was also sometimes used for other signalling purposes; there are records of temple bells being used for military communication from as far back as the Genpei War (1180–1185 CE). Smaller versions were subsequently cast for battlefield use, as the large temple bells were too heavy and unwieldy to transport. These smaller bonshō were used primarily as alarms to warn of enemy attacks; commands were given using drums and conches. As part of Japanese New Year celebrations, people queue to ring the temple bells 108 times in a ceremony known as ; the 108 peals of the bell are intended to purge humanity of the 108 earthly temptations. During the Buddhist Bon Festival, a special type of bonshō called an is rung. This bell is hung above a well, and it is believed that the sound of the bell resonates down the well into the underworld, to summon the spirits of the dead. At the end of the festival, another bonshō, called an , is rung to send the spirits back and to represent the end of the summer. During World War II the demand for metal for the war effort resulted in many bells being melted down for scrap. As a result, those that survived are generally regarded as important historic artifacts. More than 70,000 bells (approximately 90 per cent of the bonshō then in existence) were destroyed in this way. However, rapid production of bells during the post-war period meant that by 1995 the number of temple bells in Japan had returned to pre-war levels. In the latter half of the twentieth century, the World Peace Bell Association was set up in Japan, with the purpose of funding and casting temple bells to be placed around the world as symbols of peace. Bonshō have also been cast in response to natural disasters such as the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami; several affected communities commissioned bells to commemorate the event. Bonshō have occasionally been used as musical instruments in modern compositions. The recorded sound of temple bells was used in Mayuzumi Toshiro's piece Olympic Campanology, used to open the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games. A temple bell is also used in performances of Jacob Druckman's piece Lamia, in which it is rung while placed on top of a kettledrum. Modern composers for percussion have sometimes used the temple bell to replace the now common sound of the orchestral tam-tam. Notable examples The oldest known bonshō (indeed, the oldest bell in the world still in use) is the Okikicho bell at Myōshin-ji, which was cast in 698. The largest is the bell at Chion-in, which was commissioned in 1633 and weighs 74 tons. It requires a twenty-five man team to sound it. Toyohara Chikanobu, The Giant Bell, c. 1890 ukiyo-e triptych depicting Benkei stealing the Mii-dera bonshō During the seventeenth century the bonshō was also a symbol of a temple's leadership; possession of the bell indicated ownership of the associated temple. As a result, bells were often stolen; the folk hero Benkei is said to have dragged the three-ton bell of Mii-dera temple up Mount Hiei during one such theft. The deep scratches in the Benkei bell, which is still displayed at Mii-dera, are said in the legend to be the result of Benkei's kicking the bell all the way back to the monastery when he discovered that it would not toll for him. The Benkei bell is also associated with the legendary hero Tawara Tōda, who originally donated it to the Mii-dera temple. He acquired it as a gift from the dragon deity Ryūjin, after saving the god from a giant centipede. \\"Kokka ankō\\"; the disastrous inscription of the Hōkō-ji bell After the Hōkō-ji temple burned down at the start of the seventeenth century, Toyotomi Hideyori sponsored its reconstruction in 1610, and commissioned a large bell as part of that process. The bell's inscription drew the ire of Tokugawa Ieyasu, who had become shōgun after wresting power from the Toyotomi clan when Hideyori's father Hideyoshi died. The inscription, (\\"Peace and tranquility for the nation\\"), broke up the characters for the shogun's name () with the kanji character for \\"peace\\" (). Tokugawa assumed Toyotomi was implying that peace would require the \\"dismemberment\\" of the Tokugawa. He used the subsequent dispute as an excuse to wage war on the Toyotomi clan, resulting in the Siege of Osaka and the eventual destruction of the Toyotomi. A bronze bonshō was among the gifts presented to Commodore Matthew Perry upon his arrival in Japan. Cast by bellmakers from the Suwa family of Higo Province, it is now held in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution. The Noh play , one of the only Noh plays to feature a prop of any significant size, is based on a legend concerning the bell of Dōjō-ji. In the story a woman named Kiyohime, the spurned mistress of a Buddhist priest named Anchin, traps her lover inside the temple's bell and then kills him by turning into a snake, coiling around the bell, and cooking him in it. The bell of the Nishi- Arai Daishi Temple in Tokyo was removed in 1943, to be melted down as part of the Japanese war effort. The crew of the USS Pasadena found it on a scrap heap and took it with them to the US as a war trophy, donating it to the city of Pasadena; the city council returned the bell to Tokyo in 1955. A similar story accompanies the bell of Manpuku-ji, which was taken to the United States on the USS Boston after the war; in this case, however, the Sendai authorities allowed the bell to remain in Boston as a symbol of friendship between the two cities. The Boston bell is the last WWII bonshō in the United States. The Japanese Peace Bell at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York was donated by Japan in 1954 as a symbol of world peace. It was created using metal reclaimed from coins and medals provided by donors from around the globe. Similar bells representing a commitment to the cause of world peace can be found in many civic areas, including Hiroshima's Peace Memorial Park. In 1995, the city of Oak Ridge, Tennessee, erected a four-ton peace bell – a replica of one of the Hiroshima bells – in the city centre as part of its fiftieth-anniversary celebrations, and to strengthen ties with Japan. The Oak Ridge Friendship Bell is decorated with dates relating to Oak Ridge's connection to Japan (the uranium used in the Hiroshima atomic bomb was produced in Oak Ridge). In 1998, a local citizen sued the city over the bell, claiming that it was a Buddhist symbol and violated local laws and the US Constitution. The case was ruled in favour of the City of Oak Ridge.

It was heard in the Natal Provincial Division on April 22, 1929, by Dove-Wilson JP, Tatham J and Matthews J. It was an appeal from the Durban Magistrate's Court. TB Horwood appeared for the appellant and JDM Rosenow for the Crown. The appellant's attorneys were CP Robinson & Goulding.  Facts  The appellant sailed for India on October 11, 1926; his estate was provisionally sequestrated on October 13, 1926. In March 1929, after his return, he was convicted of contravening section 142(a) of the Insolvency Act,Act 32 of 1916. in that he had failed to attend the first meeting of his creditors, held on November 11, 1926. The magistrate, in his reasons, stated that he was satisfied, on the facts set out above, that it was physically impossible for appellant to attend the meeting. He convicted the appellant because he must have been aware, when he left the Union, of the act of insolvency which must have preceded his sequestration. His failure to attend the meeting, therefore, was due to his own fault in leaving the Union with knowledge of such act. The magistrate referred to R v Mahomed Abbas1916 CPD 178.1916 AD 233. and R v Mayer Brothers,6 HCG 130. and said that, since the trial, his attention had been drawn to the case of R v Moosa.[1929] CPD (24-12 28).  Judgment  Dove- Wilson JP held on appeal for the Natal Provincial Division that the appellant did not know and could not have known of the date of the meeting until after it was held. In addition, it would have been physically impossible for him to attend even if he had known the date. There was, therefore, no ground for his conviction. In Rex v Korsten,(1927) 48 NPD 12. a slightly earlier case, Dove- Wilson JP had rejected the defence of impossibility, since in there the duty with which the accused had failed to comply was an absolute one: \\"It is no excuse for him to say that he was ignorant [of the law...]. It was his duty to make himself aware of it, and if his neglect to do so has brought about his failure [to comply...], he has contravened the law.\\"13.

Burke's religious thought was grounded in his belief that religion is the foundation of civil society.Edmund Burke, Reflections on the Revolution in France (London: J. M. Dent & Sons, 1964), 87. He sharply criticized deism and atheism and emphasized Christianity as a vehicle of social progress.Ian Harris, \\"Burke and Religion\\", in David Dwan and Christopher J Insole eds., The Cambridge Companion to Edmund Burke (Cambridge University Press, 2012), 103. Born in Ireland to a Protestant father and Catholic mother, Burke vigorously defended the Church of England, but also demonstrated sensitivity to Catholic concerns. He linked the conservation of a state religion with the preservation of citizens’ constitutional liberties and highlighted Christianity’s benefits not only to the believer’s soul but also to political arrangements.Harris, 98.  Early views  Burke's early essays \\"Religion of No Efficacy Considered as a State Engine\\" and \\"Religion\\" criticize contemporary efforts to reduce religion to a social and political instrument.Edmund Burke, \\"Religion of No efficacy considered as a State Engine\\" in H. V. F. Somerset ed., A Note-book of Edmund Burke (Cambridge University Press, 1957), 67. \\"The Principle of Religion\\", Burke wrote, \\"is that God attends to our actions to reward and punish them\\".A Note-book, 67. According to Burke, religion is ultimately something mysterious.'A Note-book, 68. It cannot exist without a personal God who places responsibilities on his creation.Edmund Burke, \\"Religion\\" in 'A Note-book, 70. Burke claimed that \\"Moral Duties are included in Religion, and enforced by it\\".Edmund Burke, \\"Religion\\". Burke's identification of religion as the source of morality is a reoccurring theme throughout his work.Harris, 92.  Social benefits of Christianity compared with deism  Ian Harris has observed that Burke \\"emphasized the social benefits of Christianity, rather than its truth\\".Harris, 103. Burke considered Christianity the source of civilization and appealed to the Christian tradition for both eternal salvation and human welfare in this life.Harris, 103 Although Burke \\"presumed the truth of Christianity\\", he did not try to explain its central doctrines.Harris, 94 This was consistent with Burke’s overall approach to religion which was essentially political and philosophical rather than theological. Burke's view that religion is the source of morality led him to view its absence as a perilous possibility.Reflections, 87. His first published book was A Vindication of Natural Society and satirizes the deism of his contemporary Viscount Bolingbroke.Edmund Burke, “A Vindication of Natural Society,” in Isaac Kramnick ed, The Portable Edmund Burke (New York: Penguin Books, 1999), 29. Drawing a distinction between revealed religions (those that believe in divinely inspired scripture) and natural religion or deism, Burke’s pseudo- Bolingbroke argues that revealed religion and civil society are similarly peppered with evils. If the remedy to revealed religion is natural religion, then the solution to civil society is natural society.Harris, 96. By connecting natural religion with a primitive state of nature, Burke suggests the anti-social and degenerating implications of deism.Harris, 96 Burke considered religion and morality \\"sublime principles\\" and called for \\"religious establishments [...] that many continually revive and support them\\".Reflections, 88. In this way, Burke envisioned Christianity as \\"contributing directly to the cohesion and improvement of society\\". Burke argued that \\"the consecration of the state by a state religious establishment\\" was necessary to secure the freedom of Englishmen.Reflections, 89. According to Burke, only a state-sanctioned religion could effectively instill citizens with a sense of awe and responsibility for their actions. A religion connected with the state was essential to making people realize that \\"they are to account for their conduct [...] to the one great Master, Author and Founder of society\\".  Pluralism and toleration  Although Burke was a forceful defender of the Church of England, his view that a revealed religion was indispensable to a society’s progress was not limited to Christianity.Harris, 99. In a speech before the House of Commons, Burke commended the \\"Hindoo Religion\\" for contributing to the \\"flourishing\\" of India.Quoted in Harris, 99. Similarly, he lauded Islamic governments for having the \\"double sanction of law and religion\\".Edmund Burke, “Speeches on the Impeachment of Warren Hastings,” in Isaac Kramnick ed, The Portable Edmund Burke (New York: Penguin Books, 1999), 397. Ian Harris cautions that these praises do not imply that Burke \\"entertained relativism about religious truth\\". Instead, Harris argues that these statements suggest Burke believed \\"that the religion which has become bound up with a society is the one that suits it\\".Harris, 100. Burke also spoke in support of Catholics and dissenters from the Church of England.Edmund Burke, \\"Speech on Relief of Protestant Dissenters\\" in Louis I. Bredvold and Ralph G, Ross eds., The Philosophy of Edmund Burke (Ann Arbor: The University of Mitchigan Press, 1960), 76–77. He argued that because the Church was \\"built up with the strong and stable matter of the gospel of liberty\\", it had nothing to fear from allowing other Christian groups to worship as they wished. Burke asserted that the Church of England’s \\"security of her own doctrines\\" made it possible to establish legal acceptance for Protestants and Catholics. \\"Toleration\\", Burke argued, \\"so far from being an attack upon Christianity, becomes the best and surest support that possibly can be given to it\\". However, Burke fiercely defended the Church establishment from attacks from within the Church of England. He publicly opposed the petition of several clergymen from the Church of England who asked to be relieved from subscription to the articles of the Act of Uniformity 1662.Edmund Burke, “Speech on the Acts of Uniformity” in Louis I. Bredvold and Ralph G, Ross eds., The Philosophy of Edmund Burke (Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1960), 119. Burke advocated allowing English dissenters to practice Christianity the way they saw fit, but he briskly opposed efforts to subvert church authorities.Edmund Burke, “Speech on the Acts of Uniformity” in Louis I. Bredvold and Ralph G, Ross eds., The Philosophy of Edmund Burke (Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1960), 119.  Religion and the French Revolution  Burke’s criticisms of the French Revolution reiterated his longstanding view that revealed religion is an integral part of a civilized society.Harris, 100. He sharply condemned the confiscation of Church property by the revolutionaries and claimed that their nonreligious views were \\"against, not only our reason, but our instincts\\". Burke predicted that if France rejected Catholicism, \\"some uncouth, pernicious, and degrading superstition might take the place of it\\". Harris observes that Burke discerned clear religious features in the French Revolution.Harris, 102. As the Revolution turned more radical and entered its international phrase, Burke thought of it \\"as no mere exercise in extending French rule, but instead as a crusade to destroy Christianity in Europe\\". \\"In a drunken delirium\\", Burke wrote, France risked \\"uncover[ing] our nakedness\\". The practice of a natural religion without revelation implied retrogression to \\"a savage and incoherent mode of life\\".Quoted in Harris, 102. Burke’s mature thought on religion reveals a remarkable consistency throughout his long career. For Burke, the French Revolution was a vivid example of the catastrophic consequences of deism which he had ridiculed in A Vindication of Natural Society more than thirty years before. The inadequacy of natural religion for both personal salvation and civil society are enduring themes of Burke’s thought. Burke believed that only revealed religions, especially Christianity, offer the possibility of social and political improvement. Linking morality and religion, Burke believed that the former could not exist without the latter. According to Burke, only institutional churches can effectively uphold these sublime principles and enable the fulfillment of man's obligations both to his neighbors and to God.

It was heard in the Natal Provincial Division on February 7, 1927, by Dove-Wilson JP, Carter J and Matthews J. The case was an application for a ruling in terms of section 58 of the Criminal and Magistrates' Courts Procedure (Amendment) Act,Act 39 of 1926. in respect of a decision by the Magistrate of Eshowe.  Facts  An accused person drove his cattle to be dipped in a township dip, but was prevented from dipping them by the township foreman, because he had not complied with a by- law which provided that no person should use the dipping tank except upon production of coupons previously purchased entitling him to do so. The accused's excuse for not having purchased such coupons was that he had not known it was necessary to do so.  Argument  Lennox Ward for the Crown referred to Rex v Dabulamanzi; Rex v Nkombo.1924 SR 66.  Judgment  The court held that, inasmuch as Act 14 of 1911 imposed an absolute duty on the accused to dip his cattle, the facts above set out afforded no defence: > Under the Stock Diseases Act the obligation to dip is imperative. The > accused had to dip and had to arrange accordingly, either by providing a > tank for himself or making use of one belonging to somebody else; and it is > no excuse for him to say that he was ignorant of a condition precedent to > the use of the tank which he elected to dip at.

The same shuttles were used by many weavers, and the practice was unpopular. It was outlawed in the U.S. state of Massachusetts in 1911 but continued even after it had been outlawed in Lancashire, England in 1952. The Lancashire cotton industry was loath to invest in hand-threaded shuttles, or in the more productive Northrop automatic looms with self-threading shuttles, which were introduced in 1902. A selection of shuttles and shuttle blanks Traditional weaving For 100 years the weaving sheds of Lancashire had been equipped with cast iron constructed looms not dissimilar to the original Roberts loom, invented by Richard Roberts. They were driven by leather belts from line shafts. They were closely packed together in pairs separated a narrow alley. One weaver was responsible for four looms; it was her duty (they were almost always girls or women) to replace the weft in the shuttle when it ran out. The weft was wound onto a removable holder called a pirn which was held in the middle of the shuttle. The weaver stopped the loom, found the shuttle, removed it, and bent the shuttle peg holding the pirn towards her, removed the pirn and replaced it with a fresh one. The shuttle had a hole at the end, known as the eye, through which the weft passed. She placed a loop of thread next to the inside edge of the eye and in an operation called \\"Kissing the shuttle\\", sucked it through. The shuttle was ready. It was placed back in the sley, All loose threads cut off and removed. A final check was made and the loom was restarted. A typical loom operated at 220 picks per minute and the weaver was paid by the piece. The weaver was adept at balancing her work, keeping all the looms working, so only one would be stopped for replenishment at one time. Labour costs were a significant proportion of the cost of producing cloth. Types of shuttles The stages in making a hand-threaded shuttle Shuttles were constructed from a dense heavy hardwood with metal tips. The wood was traditionally sourced from a box tree. Imported timbers such as persimmon and cornel were also commonly used. The shuttle was shaped and hollowed using conventional wood working techniques, and the metal tips are pressed onto the block. Strips of fox fur or similar were stuck to the inside of a shuttle to stop the thread ballooning as it left the pirn. There are many designs of shuttle. The Pemberton Loom needed a shuttle with a hinged shuttle-peg to hold the pirn; the later Draper loom shuttles clasped metal rings on the head of the pirn using a spring steel clip. The Draper Company claimed it had developed over 5000 different types of shuttle to meet \\"the needs of the mills and the whims of the weavers\\". The eye of the shuttle was often made of porcelain. The thread from the pirn had to be led through the eye before it could be used. The fastest way to do this was to suck it through. =Hand- threaded shuttle= The eye of this shuttle was not a closed ring. Patented methods were used to enable the weft to be threaded into the eye, the challenges were production cost, maintaining production speed both in the speed it would run and the time needed to thread it and doff it. =Self- threading shuttle= Metcalfs self threading shuttle was gripped the metal ringed pirn using a spring clip that engaged with the rings. The depleted pirn was then automatically rewound while a new pirn was pressed into the clips and the trailing thread clipped into the complex eye. Shuttle kissing The top view of the shuttle shows the position of the pirn and a number of ceramic ringed eyes leading to short tubes through the body of the shuttle. Three eyes are visible. Two lead through to the bottom, one leads to the side. The bottom of the suction shuttle, manufactured and dated by Jowetts in 1973, showing the eyes Shuttle kissing was widely opposed by weavers who thought it led to byssinosis, a lung disease caused by cotton fibres lodging in the air passages. Shuttles were shared and would be kissed by several weavers and tacklers. They were grimy, and the use of lipstick rendered them sticky. A piece of rabbit fur was a component of the shuttle, harbouring additional pathogens. In United States, Board of Health physicians agreed that there was a potential risk of spreading disease, and united, persuaded the state legislature in Massachusetts to enact reform. In Lancashire medical opinion remained divided and no legislation was passed. In 1911, the Amalgamated Weavers' Association enquired of their Lancashire members their objections to the suction shuttle. The main concern was the risk of spreading diseases, followed closely by injuries to teeth and inhaling dirt and dust into their lungs. A Home Office Report of 1912 concluded that kissing shuttles caused no health risk, though it was unsanitary and recommended the self-threading shuttle. Self-threading shuttles became mandatory in 1952, though kissing shuttles were still being manufactured in the 1970s. Tuberculosis Robert Koch discovered the tubercle bacillus in 1882 and this led to a period of 40 years in which the medical professions debated the means of transmission and tried to assimilate this new knowledge into existing practice. Koch's hypothesis was that the bacillus was transmitted by dried sputum on dust particles, while a Dr Charles Chaplin, the medical officer for Rhode Island, proposed that close physical contact between people was necessary and spitting and kissing were the primary cause of infection. It was in 1899 that Hermann Biggs, the chief medical officer for New York City determined that transmission was caused by dust or close physical contact. In Massachusetts, in 1906, it was declared that shuttle kissing was an unwholesome practice because it drew dust cotton lint into the lungs which caused them to spit. This problem was being treated as an occupational health issue as well as one of infectious disease control and this prompted the legislature to act. In Lancashire, bacteriology was less advanced and in 1900 it was still believed that 'consumption' (tuberculosis) was not an infectious disease and the contagion was due to sanitation or moral laxity. The 1912 Home Office Report by Messrs Bollhouse Fletcher and Shackleton examined the problem, taking evidence from 58 medical officers in Lancashire. A list of diseases said to arise from shuttle kissing was compiled but close study could only find and document five actual cases. These were a cancer at Oswaldtwistle, tonsillitis at Rawtenstall, three deaths from tuberculosis at Bacup, phthisis at Tyldesley and scarlet fever at Burnley. The three deaths were examined in detail but no link to shuttle kissing was established and other forms of close contact were equally probable. Thus medical officers in Lancashire did not see this problem as within their remit, and were divided on causality. In 1918, Mr Middleton Hewat, Preston's Tuberculosis Officer and Assistant Medical Officer of Health, saw that weavers had the highest tuberculosis rate of any cotton operatives, and recommended that hand-threaded shuttles should be introduced, while not mentioning the system used in the Northrop automatic loom which were already operated by Horrocks, Crewdson and Sons in Preston. The issue was then discussed by the Parliamentary Shuttle Kissing Committee in 1919 who recommended that shuttle kissing should stop but delegated the decision to the individual towns. The Amalgamated Weavers' Association, ever conciliatory, welcomed the recommendation but suggested that the employers should be given five years to use the old shuttles. The Lancashire Cotton Spinners' and Manufacturers' Association rejected the recommendation as it was the employers' right to conduct their business the way they saw fit, but agreed to recommend the use of hand threaders where there was no economic disadvantage. The weavers failed to persuade the Secretary of State to use the 1901 Factory Act to end the practice, in stark contrast to the alliance of medical and labour activists that promoted the Anthrax Prevention Act 1919 or the action against scrotal cancer. The 1920s slump and next world war intervened so no action was taken until 1952 when they were banned on the grounds they were no longer economic. Other occupational health issues A further danger was the practice of steaming. To weave cotton, the air had to be moist and weaving sheds were built into the hillside so the structure would remain damp, and additional moisture was added by keeping the floors wet. To keep the air moist in a controlled way, steam pipes at roof height constantly sprayed the air. Lancashire Members of Parliament sought to have steaming stopped through the means of private members' bills with no success. Steaming was discussed and deemed safe by Home Office reports in 1928 and 1929.

The church was located in the historic part of the city, in the former village of Kondopoga, on the shores of Lake Onega Kondopozhskaya Bay on a promontory jutting into Chupa Bay. Elevation Church was 42 meters. The height of the tent and log towers, two octagons and the quadrangle, and the quadrangular height and width was in the ratio of about 1:2. Assumption Church was a monument of wooden architecture and Zaonezhskaya branch Kondopozhsky City Museum. During the holidays of the Orthodox Church services were held, mostly in the summer. Regular services were held in the Church of Candlemas, which was rebuilt by the local architect of the transformer station. It was destroyed by fire in August 2018. History The church was built in 1774 in the style of Russian wooden architecture. Belongs to Prionezhskaya school hip architecture. The church was built in memory of the victims participating Kizhi uprising, which was attended by farmers and township Kondopozhskaya. According to the Decree of 23 January 1918 \\"On the separation of church and state\\" and instruction in 1920 and the People's Commissariat Department of Museums \\"on its application\\" all church property \\"passed into the facilities management department for museums, conservation of works of art and antiquities Commissariat\\". In August 1926 the church inspected Onega expedition led by Igor Grabar, which was attended by the architect PD Baranovsky, restorer GO Chirikov, NN Orange and photographer AV Ljadov. The Church was not rebuilt, but was restored in 1927, in 1950 and in 1999. In the summer of 1960 the Council of Ministers of the RSFSR placed the church under state protection. Lost buildings Near the Assumption Church there were two wooden buildings that disappeared in the Soviet era: the winter Church of the Nativity of the Virgin (1857) and the belfry (18th century). In the years 1829-1831, next to the Church of the Assumption at the expense of the parishioners had built a wooden tower, and in 1857 - the winter Church of the Nativity of the Virgin. The bell tower was demolished in 1930, and the winter church in 1960. The Assumption Church was totally destroyed by fire on 10 August 2018. It had been one of the most important landmarks of Kondopoga.

According to the Legacies of British Slave-Ownership at the University College London, Blake was awarded a payment as a slave trader in the aftermath of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 with the Slave Compensation Act 1837. The British Government took out a £15 million loan (worth £ in ) with interest from Nathan Mayer Rothschild and Moses Montefiore which was subsequently paid off by the British taxpayers (ending in 2015). Blake was associated with ten different claims, he owned 1651 slaves in Tobago and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and received a £34,301 17s 9d payment at the time (worth £ in ). Retrieved on 20 March 2019. Views Blake was initially known as a bullionist, one of the monetary writers of the early 19th century. He published Observations on the Principles Which Regulate the Course of Exchange, and on the Present Depreciated Slate of the Currency (1810). For half a century it was considered a leading authority on exchange rates. It made heavy reference to the writing of John Wheatley. Fossati has argued that the debates on money and bank credit for British parliamentary reports of 1804 and 1810 clarified the theory, at the hands of Wheatley and others, including in particular Blake and John Leslie Foster (with Walter Boyd, Lord King, and Henry Thornton). Joseph Lowe, who wrote many reviews of the pamphlet literature of the bullion debate, approved of Blake's content but complained he was verbose. Blake's 1823 pamphlet on government expenditure, Observations on the Effects Produced by Government Expenditure during the Restriction of Cash Payments, caused a stir, however. It was a pioneer work of its period, and has been considered to have anticipated the transfer theory of Frank William Taussig. David Ricardo wrote a reply, and Blake a rejoinder. Ricardo wrote notes on Blake that remained unpublished until 1951. Matters of definition still plagued discussion: Ricardo's idea of depreciation clouded, in Blake's view, the issues. In common with many contemporaries, Blake used balance of trade inconsistently or unclearly as a term. Mark Blaug's view was that Blake had shown up \\"blind spots\\" in Ricardo's theory. Ricardo wrote to his correspondent Hutches Trower that John Ramsay McCulloch hadn't managed to talk Blake out of his \\"newly published opinions\\";Letters of David Ricardo to Hutches Trower and Others, 1811–1823 (1899), pp. 205–6; archive.org. in fact, as he told McCulloch, Ricardo had seen the paper before publication, and concluded that Blake agreed more with him than he was aware of. John Stuart Mill in reviewing the work denied the ability of governments to stimulate economic activity. Mill defended Say's Law, while Blake was more in sympathy with the views of Robert Malthus on the economic depression of the early 1820s (though he added a disclaimer on not arguing in terms of public policy). Mill in defending Ricardo interpreted the orthodox doctrine on the export of gold in a way that conceded its part in bilateral trade. He in fact used some of Blake's ideas in his later work Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy (1844), without attribution. McCulloch later reprinted Blake's 1810 pamphlet, praising it in his introduction of 1857. Family Blake married Mary Nash 25 July 1797 (bringing an end to his fellowship) and the estates of John Darker were settled on the couple. The death in 1822 of Edward Loveden Loveden of Buscot Park, who had married Mary's sister Anne, brought them an inheritance.historyofparliamentonline.org, Loveden, Edward Loveden (?1751–1822), of Buscot Park, Berks.

Premise The series revolved around Kate (Malin Åkerman), a young, attractive, blonde party girl, who marries a middle aged lawyer named Pete (Bradley Whitford). The marriage comes with Pete's two ex-wives: the stern, perfectionist doctor, Diane (Marcia Gay Harden), and the flaky, flamboyant, new age Jackie (Michaela Watkins). Also, Pete has three children from the prior relationships: overachieving, good girl, Hillary (Bailee Madison), slacker Warren (Ryan Lee), and rambunctious Bert (Albert Tsai). The series explores the marriage and generation gap between Kate and Pete, along with the modern family dynamics between them, the ex-wives, and their respective children. Production Hillary was played by Gianna LePera in the pilot, but replaced with Bailee Madison when the series went into production. On November 1, 2013, ABC gave a full-season order to the series bringing the first season to 22 episodes.

Melia Robinson of Business Insider named it the tenth best new TV show of 2013, saying that it \\"delivers fresh humor, steeped in irony with a surprising sweetness\\" and dubbed it \\"a 'Modern-er Family'\\". Hank Stuever of The Washington Post gave the series a \\"B\\", praising the adults as \\"entertaining to watch and believably flawed\\" and the kids as \\"talented wiseacres\\". Matt Webb Mitovich of TVLine called it one of the best and strongest new sitcoms of the year, but criticised the network for putting it in a \\"ghastly\\" time slot. He particularly singled out Malin Åkerman for praise, saying that she \\"no less than shines here, coming off as fun-loving but not flaky, warm and not overheated\\". Other critics agreed with Roth Cornet of IGN singling out Åkerman's chemistry with co-star Bradley Whitford and her aptitude for physical comedy. Gabriel Mizrahi of The Huffington Post called Åkerman \\"terrific\\" and the show \\"funny and realistic\\" with \\"delightfully un-sitcom-y performances\\". Maggie Pehanick of PopSugar and Daniel Fienberg of HitFix also liked Åkerman and Whitford's chemistry, with Fienberg saying that \\"Åkerman's bubbly energy has instantly great foils in [Marcia Gay] Harden's brilliant iciness and [Michaela] Watkins' loopy mania and also in the sarcastic preppiness that Whitford plays as well as anyone.\\" Danielle Turchiano of The Examiner gave the show 4 stars out of 5 and praised Åkerman, Harden, and Watkins for presenting \\"some of the most interesting and funniest women on television\\". She did feel that the title suggests the show is something that it's not, a point that Joanne Ostrow of The Denver Post agreed with. Willa Paskin of Salon called the title \\"terrible... an insult to its lovely, daffy main character and... at odds with the show's focus on female relationships. It's not just dumb marketing, it belies the women-are-not-reducible-to-clichés spirit of the show.\\" She went on to call the show \\"wonderfully cast\\", particularly enjoying Åkerman's performance and saying that \\"Like the late Happy Endings' Elisha Cuthbert, she seems to delight in going for it in the way that only pretty blonde women who have been stuck playing pretty blonde love interests in romantic comedies can.\\" Executive producer Lee Eisenberg explained that the title is \\"meant to be ironic\\" and that the show will focus on how Åkerman's character is not like a \\"trophy wife\\". When Åkerman read the script, she loved the writing and the character and how \\"not trophy wife\\" she is.

The driver of a motor vehicle was prone to epileptic fits, and knew as much, but nevertheless put himself behind the wheel of a motor car. He suffered a fit while driving and collided with a pedestrian and another car. The court on appeal sustained his conviction by a magistrate on the ground that the negligence which the accused there committed was not so much in the driving of the vehicle, but in his driving at all, knowing of his physical disability. A reasonable person would have foreseen the likelihood of a fit and refrained from driving. The appellant's attorneys were Frank & Joffe.  Facts  Whilst driving a motor-car on a public road, the appellant had sustained an epileptic seizure and lost control of the car, which collided with a pedestrian and with another car. He had been charged and convicted of reckless or negligent driving on a public road in contravention of section 31(1)(a) of the Transvaal Motor Ordinance.Ordinance 17 of 1931. His defence was that he was not responsible for his actions because of the seizure. He had suffered from epileptic fits for a period of some thirteen years, but contended that, for certain specified reasons, he did not expect an attack of this nature on the occasion in question, or, alternatively, that he did not expect an attack without a warning feeling, which would have enabled him to take the precaution of bringing the car to a stop. He stated he was 28 years of age and had been driving a car for eight years. His health was normal except that occasionally he suffered from epilepsy. He had had attacks since the age of 14 or 15, and generally had what he called a \\"warning feeling\\" five or ten minutes before an attack. There were, he said, times when he had a giddy feeling which was part of the warning; at other times he had this feeling without any attack. He had paid an unlicensed practitioner for four weeks' treatment and was told that he was cured. On the morning of the accident he had had an attack preceded by the usual warning. He stated that he had never before had two attacks on the same day.  Argument  V. Rosenstein, for the appellant, contended that there was no negligence within the meaning of sections 31(1)(a) or 31(1)(b) of the Ordinance.Rex v Verity-Amm 1934 TPD 416 at 422. JC van Niekerk, for the Crown, argued that the appellant was negligent inasmuch as he drove with knowledge of his physical weakness.McKerron on Delicts (p. 30).Rex v Meiring 1927 AD 41.Gibbs's Trial of Motor Car Accident Cases (2nd ed., p. 68).Hart v Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway Co. 21 LTR 261.Gibbs on Collisions on Land (4th ed., p. 32).Gaffney v Dublin United Tramways 1916, 2 IR 472.Annotation in 64 ALR, p. 136. Rosenstein, in reply, referred to Gardiner and Lansdown.4th ed., vol. I, p. 77.  Judgment  The appeal was dismissed. Millin J held (and Maritz J concurred) that section 31(1)(a) was wide enough to cover all cases of reckless or negligent driving which would be civilly actionable if proved to be the proximate cause of damage sustained by the plaintiff. Its generality was not cut down by the provision made for special cases in the succeeding subsections. The appellant had correctly been convicted of a contravention of section 31(1)(a) by recklessly or negligently driving a motor car on a public road, inasmuch as his physical condition to his knowledge made it impossible for him to drive in a public road without probable danger to others. The accused had been negligent, not so much in the driving of the vehicle, but in his driving at all, knowing of his physical disability. A reasonable person would have foreseen the likelihood of a fit and refrained from driving.  R v Schoonwinkel  In a later case with similar facts, R v Schoonwinkel, the accused had suffered an epileptic fit at the time of the accident, rendering his mind a blank. The nature of his epilepsy was such that he would normally not have realised or foreseen the dangers of driving, having had only two previous minor attacks, the last a long time before the accident. This evidence, distinguishing the case from Victor, exonerated him from criminal responsibility.

Equipment The car was supplied with an adjustable steering column and body insulation. It comfortably carried four passengers with room for a small fifth passenger in the centre of the back seat. Even the quarter-lights were supplied with blinds, there were flush fitting footrests in the back of the large, adjustable, front seats with pull straps above. The back floor was flat except for the somewhat pronounced propellor shaft tunnel. The boot was provided with a fitted suitcase, the spare wheel sitting horizontally in the space below. The door could be let down and used as a luggage platform. Chassis The monopiece steel roof, doors and floors were insulated against heat and noise. The frame had cruciform centre bracing and its cross members were reversed to form box sections with the side members. Engine clutch and gearbox were insulated as one assembly from the chassis by live rubber, there being two suspension points in front and one at the back of the gearbox. Silencer and exhaust system were insulated from the chassis by rubber mounting. Suspension Half-elliptical zinc interleaved springs were fitted with self-lubricating discs and controlled by hydraulic shock absorbers. In front the springs were shackled forward and were flat, the back springs underhung. Brakes Brakes by Girling were of the wedge and roller mechanically operated type and the four were worked by hand or foot. Steering Steering was by hour-glass worm and sector. Road Test The Times' correspondent reported that the engine felt sturdy and willing but that refinement and brilliance were \\"not its strong points\\". The extra low pressure tyres allowed lightness and sway at speed he said but the car held the road satisfactorily and 65 miles an hour proved a comfortable maximum speed. Revision Eight months after the road test was published The Times felt able to report that the Austin Fourteen was now a much improved car. Engine The engine had been given a new cylinder head, larger downdraught carburettor, larger inlet valves and a higher compression ratio. Power output had moved up from 38.7 bhp at 3,800 rpm to 46 bhp at 4,000 rpm, an increase of near 20%. 1939 Now supplied with an improved engine mounting, new pistol grip handbrake, shock absorbers, lubricated road springs and given, like the Twelve, higher and wider doors and a longer bonnet.

The appellant must have foreseen the likelihood of an attack in the event of the baboon's escaping; he was, the court held, therefore rightly convicted of culpable homicide. The case was an appeal from a decision in the Transvaal Provincial Division by Galgut J and Clayden J, who had dismissed an appeal from a conviction in a magistrate's court.  Facts  The appellant had been charged with and convicted of culpable homicide. It appeared that he was a partner in a partnership which owned and conducted a small shop, adjacent to which was a baboon, kept in a cage-like structure. Arriving at the shop one morning, he found the animal outside the cage. On inspection of the cage, he found that one of the lower horizontal planks at the back of the cage had apparently broken, thereby creating an opening through which the animal had easily made its exit. After arming himself with a revolver, he persuaded the animal to re- enter the cage and then decided to repair the cage. He removed the whole of the broken plank. He placed one end of a new plank on the inner side of the right terminal uprights, leaving the other end of the plank wholly unsupported. He was busy nailing the supported end when the animal got out again in the same place. The animal snatched a baby, one Elpitha Piccoco, from a perambulator, bit it and then, apparently intimidated by revolver shots fired by the appellant, threw the child to the ground and retreated into its cage.  Argument  In an appeal from a decision of a Provincial Division, which had dismissed an appeal from a conviction in a magistrate's court, D. Kuny, for the appellant, argued that the appellant, in repairing the cage, did all that could reasonably have been expected of him in the circumstances. His conduct in that regard was not in any way negligent. The second escape of the baboon was not attributable to any fault on his part. In any event, even if the appellant was negligent in the above respect, he could not reasonably have foreseen the death of the deceased as a result of such negligence.See S v Van Der Mescht 1962 (1) SA 521 (A).See S v Bernardus 1965 (3) SA 287 (A). GN Barrie, for the State, contended that, in order to hold the appellant liable for the death of the child, it was necessary to show that he at least had custody or control of the animal at the time of the attack on the child; there must have been some degree of culpa on his part.See Myburgh v J. and A. Jorgenson 1914 EDL 94, 93.Coreejes v Carnarvon Munisipaliteit en 'n Ander 1964 (2) SA 457. In Robertson v Boyce,1912 AD 377. the Appeal Court had recognised the principle that dogs were ferae naturae; as such, the owners must be taken to know of their vicious propensities. It was therefore submitted by the State that it was not necessary to prove scienter of such viciousness before liability could be attached to a person having the ownership, custody or control over such an animal when it causes damage.See Robertson v Boyce 373.See Myburgh v J. and A. Jorgenson 94. Monkeys, the State noted, have been held to be animals ferae naturae.Myburgh v J. and A. Jorgenson 93. It was submitted that baboons also fell within this category. In any event there was ample evidence, the State contended, to show that the appellant had knowledge of the vicious tendencies of the baboon. The only inference to be drawn from all the evidence was that, if the appellant was not in fact the owner, he, at the very least, had the custody and control of the animal. It was clear in South African law that the owner of a vicious animal which attacks a person who was lawfully at the place where he was injured, and who neither provoked the attack nor by his negligence contributed to his own injury, was liable, as owner, to make good the resulting injury. If an owner keeps such an animal on his premises, it is his duty to take proper care of it. He is under an obligation to see that the animal is not a danger to persons lawfully on his premises.See O'Callaghan NO v Chaplin 1927 AD 310.Klem v Boshof 1931 CPD 188. If the liability depended upon negligence, the negligence would consist in the owner's allowing it to be at large and not under control, although he knew, or ought to know, or must be taken to have known, that it was an animal ferae naturae, and that it might, therefore, at any time, indulge in its ferocious propensities.See Robertson v Boyce 378. The test in determining whether or not a person was negligent in the keeping of a vicious animal was whether or not he acted as a reasonable man.See Rex v Eustace 1948 (3) SA 860. The appellant was negligent in that he did not satisfy himself that the cage was in a satisfactory condition. The very fact that the baboon succeeded in escaping from the cage went to show that the cage was inadequate for the purpose it was intended to serve. Alternatively, the State argued, the cage became inadequate subsequently, and the appellant was negligent in not satisfying himself from time to time that the cage remained in a good and serviceable condition.See Coreejes v Carnarvon Munisipaliteit en 'n Ander 457. There was ample evidence on record, the State continued, to show that the appellant, as a reasonably prudent person, must have foreseen the possibility of an attack by the baboon; in fact, he did foresee the possibility.See Administrator, Cape v Preston 1961 (3) SA 572.Cape Town Municipality v Paine 1923 AD 217.It was clear to the State that the word \\"likelihood,\\" as used in the last-mentioned case, should be understood to mean a possibility of harm against which a reasonable man would take precautions. See Herschel v Mrupe 1954 (3) SA 471. The appellant, as a reasonable and prudent person, must have foreseen the possibility that an attack by the baboon could have fatal results.See S v Bernardus 1965 (3) SA 302. The State contended that the court should ascertain whether there had been, on the part of the appellant, an omission to do something which he ought under the circumstances to have done, which would have prevented the occurrence. The obvious answer was that appellant had omitted to see that the cage was at all times in a good and safe condition. Furthermore, the reasonable man would, under the circumstances in which appellant found himself, have seen to it that the cage was at all times safe, and in a proper condition. This omission to act as the reasonable man amounted, in the State's view, to negligence, for which appellant could be held criminally responsible.See Rex v Meiring 1927 AD 41. Here it was stated that the test of negligence to be applied in criminal trials was the same as that applied in civil cases: the standard of care and skill which would be observed by a reasonable man.See also Regal v African Superslate (Pty) Ltd 1963 (1) SA 121, 109, 116. The appellant had failed to observe that degree of care which a reasonable man would have observed under the circumstances: that is to say, the degree of care which the diligens pater familias, or the average prudent person, would have observed. On this culpa the appellant's accountability for the unintentional death of the child was based.See Cape Town Municipality v Paine 216.NJ van der Merwe, Discussion of Regal v African Superslate (T.H.R.H.R., 1963, Vol. 26, p. 129 at p. 134).  Judgment  The Appellate Division found that at all material times the baboon was in the custody and control of the appellant. It was, accordingly, the appellant's duty to see that the animal was not permitted to remain outside its cage. The court held further that the appellant had taken no steps whatsoever to see that the animal did not get out of its cage while he was engaged in repairing it. He must have foreseen the likelihood of the animal making an attack upon somebody should it get out of the cage. The court held, therefore, that the appellant had been rightly convicted.

Later found to have been intoxicated but unarmed at the time of the shooting, Denyakin was shot by Officer Stephen Rankin of the Portsmouth Police Department, who was responding to a report of a burglary at the home where Denyakin was staying. According to Rankin and the Portsmouth Police, Denyakin had ignored Rankin's verbal orders and lunged at him aggressively just prior to the shooting, forcing Rankin to defend himself. Denyakin's family and friends have questioned this account of the incident. A grand jury declined to indict Rankin on criminal charges in February 2012, and the jury in a civil trial found him to be not culpable for Denyakin's death in March 2012. Victim Denyakin was a native of Kazakhstan. Early reports gave his surname as Suchin. His father Ivan Denyakin, mother Yelena Denyakina, and younger brother Roman Denyakin resided in Karaganda, Karagandy Province, Kazakhstan. He attended Karaganda School No. 3 and went on to a local university; in his third year of studies there in 2006, he obtained a temporary U.S. visa under the Work and Travel USA program, and moved to the United States. Local newspaper The Virginian-Pilot later reported that Denyakin overstayed his visa in order to continue working in the United States. He was sending money back to Kazakhstan to help his parents support his younger brother. At the time of his death, he had been employed as a cook at the Renaissance Portsmouth Hotel for two years. Denyakin had dated a Romanian woman named Nicoletta, but the two later separated. In February 2011, about two months before his death, Denyakin went to the building where his ex- girlfriend lived; Portsmouth police officers were summoned and arrested Denyakin at the scene, alleging that he had broken a window there and threatened them. He was charged with misdemeanor stalking, but the charges were dropped after Nicoletta failed to appear at court proceedings against Denyakin; a friend stated to reporters that she had left the United States. After Denyakin's breakup with Nicoletta, he had no place to live, so his friends Maurice and Natalya Wilson invited him to stay with them in their apartment on Green Street in the Olde Towne district of Portsmouth. Natalya was from Ukraine and spoke limited English. She communicated with Denyakin primarily in Russian. Shooting On the afternoon of his death, Denyakin went to the apartment of another friend, Aileen Putnam, to pick up his laundry. While at his friend's home, he consumed four or five screwdrivers. According to a report in The Virginian-Pilot, Putnam became concerned by Denyakin's behavior and texted her boyfriend, who came to her apartment at around 7 PM and told Denyakin to go home and sober up. Denyakin was still intoxicated when he arrived at the Wilsons' apartment at roughly 9 PM; after an argument with Natalya, who had previously told Denyakin that she did not like seeing him drunk around her baby, Natalya left the apartment and went to the restaurant where her husband Maurice worked. She found Maurice and his friend there and asked them to come home and deal with the situation; the two men carried Denyakin outside, took away his keys, and set him on the stoop to sober up, but Maurice had to return to work, leaving Natalya alone. Denyakin awoke roughly an hour later and began pounding on the door. Natalya became alarmed and asked her neighbor to call 9-1-1. During the call, the neighbor suggested that Denyakin was \\"a stranger\\". The dispatcher thus announced the incident as a burglary in progress. Officer Rankin was nearby dealing with a homeless man and at 10:10 PM stated to the dispatcher that he would respond to the more serious \\"in progress\\" call. According to Rankin and other police sources, Rankin arrived at the Green Street apartment at 10:12 PM and found Denyakin standing at the same door of the building where a break-in had been reported. Rankin gave Denyakin verbal commands to turn around, but Denyakin was unresponsive to these commands, and placed his hands \\"at the midsection of his body, in the waistband area\\", before charging at Rankin, who fired his weapon \\"in an effort to stop the threat\\". There were no witnesses to the shooting, and because officer Rankin had not synchronized his belt microphone with the dashcam in his police car that night, there was no audio or video recording of the events. The Virginian-Pilot, however, later reported that Natalya had heard officer Rankin order Denyakin to \\"get down\\" three times before gunfire erupted. Less than two minutes had elapsed between Rankin's arrival on the scene and the shooting. A second officer arrived at the scene soon after, finding the glass in the front door shattered and Denyakin on the ground. Denyakin was dead by the time paramedics arrived. An autopsy confirmed that he had 11 bullet wounds in his chest, left shoulder, right upper arm, left thigh, right flank, hip, right wrist, and left hand, and a blood alcohol content of 0.28%. Aftermath The shooting attracted considerable media coverage, both in Virginia and in Kazakhstan. The government of Kazakhstan paid the expenses for Denyakin's mother to travel to the United States, make statements to police, and repatriate her son's body. He was buried in the Federovsky Cemetery in Karaganda in May 2011. Erlan Idrisov, Kazakhstan's ambassador in Washington, DC, made a statement of concern to the United States Department of State, demanded a \\"thorough investigation\\", and expressed his hopes that Denyakin's relatives would be \\"compensated\\" properly. During the investigation, Kazakhstan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs communicated frequently with the State Department about the case, and with State Department officials, among them Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Robert O. Blake, Jr. as well as then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The Portsmouth Police Department did not initially reveal the identity of the officer who had shot Denyakin, but eventually released Rankin's name. Media reports noted that Officer Rankin had worked for the Portsmouth Police Department for three-and-a-half years, was a native of Central California, had served in the United States Navy from 2002 to 2007, and had been honorably discharged. Once his identity had been revealed, Rankin's social media activity immediately came under scrutiny from media in both the U.S. and Kazakhstan. Facebook postings, including a posting of the Misfits song \\"Mommy, Can I Go Out & Kill Tonight\\", an image of a lynching with the slogan \\"Love is … Doing whatever is necessary,\\" and photographs of Rankin's gun and gun cleaning equipment, on which he had commented that it \\"would be better if i was dirtying them instead of cleaning them!\\" This and other incidents involving social media activity led the International Association of Chiefs of Police to issue reminders to all officers to use caution when making social media postings. Rankin later admitted to making numerous comments on online articles at the website of The Virginian-Pilot under the pseudonym \\"yourealythinkthat\\", defending his actions and disputing other commenters who questioned them. Criminal investigation An investigation into the shooting was handled by the Virginia State Police, while Commonwealth's Attorney Earle C. Mobley also referred the matter to a state grand jury for consideration of charges. Rankin was placed on administrative leave during the investigation. On February 9, 2012, the grand jury refused to indict Rankin. Civil suit The Denyakin family filed a civil suit against Rankin on July 1, 2011, seeking US $22 million in damages. The suit, a civil action for deprivation of rights under , was filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, and came before Judge Rebecca Smith. In November, the court ordered that the Denyakin family's lawyer could have access to state police investigative records. In February 2012, after the grand jury refused to indict Rankin on criminal charges, the judge in the civil suit ordered a trial so that a jury could hear the case against the respondents. As early as May 2011, Denyakin's lawyers had disputed Rankin's claim that Denyakin had lunged at him, stating that with a blood alcohol of 0.28%, three-and-a-half times the state threshold for driving under the influence of alcohol, Denyakin would not have been able to walk or talk straight, let alone lunge or fight. In court, they argued that Denyakin could not have had his hands in his pants as the witness stated, because he had a bullet wounds on his hands but no holes in his jeans. After hearing three days of testimony, the jury returned its verdict on March 3, 2012, finding that Rankin had not violated Denyakin's civil rights by using excessive force, did not act with gross negligence, and did not commit unprovoked assault and battery causing death. A subsequent appeal by Denyakin's family was unsuccessful. Shooting of William Chapman In 2015, news media drew comparisons between the shooting of Kirill Denyakin and the death of a young, unarmed African-American man who had also been shot by Officer Rankin. Rankin shot William Chapman from several feet away in April 2015, following a struggle after having attempted to arrest him for shoplifting in a Wal-Mart parking lot in Portsmouth. On September 3, 2015, Rankin was indicted on a charge of first degree murder. On August 4, 2016, Rankin was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter in the case.

It consists of the Glan- Münchweiler–Altenglan section, which was built as part of the Landstuhl–Kusel railway and sections that were built later for military reasons: Homburg–Glan- Münchweiler, Altenglan–Staudernheim and Odernheim–Bad Münster am Stein. The line had strategic importance, otherwise traffic was rather low, except on the Glan Munchweiler–Altenglan section. The line runs right next to the river for 60 km of its 85 km length from Homburg to Bad Münster. The line is closed, except for the ten km section from Glan-Münchweiler to Altenglan that forms part of the Landstuhl–Kusel line. It is used for tourism and draisine rides have been offered on the section between Altenglan and Staudernheim since 2000. In contrast, the Waldmohr–Glan-Münchweiler section has been dismantled. History Although the possibility of a railway along the Glan to connect the Saar region and the region around Bingen would have been obvious from a geographical perspective, the fact that in the 19th century it would have run across the territory of several countries prevented the realisation of the project for some time. The first efforts were aimed at a railway connecting the north-western Palatinate, starting in 1856. During the construction of the Rhine-Nahe Railway (Rhein-Nahe-Bahn), a proposal was developed to build a railway via Lauterecken, Altenglan and Kusel to St. Wendel and Neunkirchen. However, these efforts were not initially successful, since Prussia demanded to be in charge of the line within its own territory. In addition, the border between Bavaria and Prussia in the middle and lower Glan valley, especially from Altenglan to Staudernheim, was very irregular, making construction difficult. In 1860, a committee was formed called Notabeln des Glan- und Lautertales (notables of the Glan and Lauter valleys). It campaigned for a line that branched in Kaiserslautern from the Palatine Ludwig Railway (Pfälzischen Ludwigsbahn), then ran via the Lauter and the lower Glan valley and met the Rhine-Nahe Railway in Staudernheim; this line was completed in the same year. Prussia opposed the proposal because it feared that the Nahe line would lose its importance. However, the project received support from Hesse- Homburg, as it would connect its exclave of Meisenheim to the rail network. The Hessian Privy Councillor Christian Bansa also supported the proposed rail link in 1861 in discussions with the Prussian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arguing that there was a greater need for it than for the planned line along the Alsenz. However, Prussia was only willing to support the Palatine Northern Railway Company (Gesellschaft der Pfälzischen Nordbahnen), which was established in 1866 and completed the Alsenz Valley Railway in 1871. Its northern end point was in the then Prussian town of Bad Münster. In contrast, neither Bavaria (which then owned some of the territory involved) nor Prussia were interested in guaranteeing the interest on loans for the proposed railway, which in 1873 was estimated to cost a total of about 3.6 million guilders. Plans for a strategic railway and the opening of the Lauterecken–Staudernheim section  The granting of the concession in the 1860s to build the Kusel-Landstuhl railway, which was opened in 1868 and follows the course of the Glan from Glan Munchweiler to Altenglan, gave new life to the proposal to build a line through the rest of the Glan valley. A company was founded in 1865 in Meisenheim to carry out the planning of this line. However, several wars in the following years at first prevented the completion of the project. Border between Bavaria and Prussia in the Glan valley from 1866 to 1945 As Alsace and Lorraine were incorporated in the German Empire in 1871 as a result of the Franco-Prussian War, the fear that France would start another war in order to regain Alsace-Lorraine developed in Germany. To prevent this, the primary interest in new railways in south- western Germany towards the end of the 19th century was in railways intended mainly for military purposes. In the Palatinate and Prussia planning started on the strategic railway, which would branch from the Palatine Ludwig Railway in Homburg and follow the Glan river, sharing the Kusel-Landstuhl railway between Glan-Münchweiler and Altenglan. On 7 September 1871, a committee met in Meisenheim to consider the plans developed by engineers for such a line. The committee issued a memorandum on 27 January 1871 that highlighted the economic and the military importance of a railway along the Glan. However, the opposition of Bavaria prevented the project for the time being; this attitude was due to the high construction costs expected. Because of the border, which would also hinder the construction, there were at the time plans for a branch line from Altenglan to St Julian, which would run exclusively through Bavarian Palatinate. Meisenheim Tunnel towards the end of the 19th century In 1891, Bavaria and Prussia signed a treaty that included the construction and operation of a line from Lauterecken to Staudernheim as a direct continuation of the Lauterbrunnen Valley Railway of the Palatine Northern Railway Company from Kaiserslautern to Lauterecken; preparatory work for its construction had already begun in 1886. Moreover, the railway entrepreneur Karl Jakob von Lavale had agreed that the Board would be responsible for half the land acquisition costs. The section between Lauterecken and Meisenheim was open on 16 June 1896 and the Lauterecken-Odernheim section was opened in October 1896. Construction work on closing the gap to Staudernheim began on 2 November, but on the same day a flood scoured the embankment at Odenbach and interrupted traffic. The remaining line to Staudernheim on the Nahe Valley Railway was finally taken into operation on 1 July 1897. Completion of the Glan Valley Railway At the same time Bavaria reversed its opposition to a strategic railway line along the entire Glan as Germany's relations with France had deteriorated in the meantime. This culminated in an agreement, concluded in November 1900, to build a strategic railway along the Glan, which would be the shortest connection from the Saar region to the Rhine. The main purpose of the route was kept secret, so the Palatine district offices received a circular which prohibited the use of terms such as \\"strategic line\\" or \\"military railway\\" in public. Nevertheless, an article entitled \\"Die Strategische Bahn in der Pfalz” (The Strategic Railway in the Palatinate) still appeared two years later in the Pfälzische Presse newspaper. The plan was for a route with high embankments, which were deemed necessary because of the frequent flooding along the Glan. The strategic line had its starting point in Scheidt, and would continue via Homburg and use the existing Landstuhl–Kusel line between Glan-Munchweiler and Altenglan and the line opened in 1896 between Lauterecken and Odernheim. Both existing lines would be duplicated. The strategic railway was planned to run on the right bank of the Nahe from Odernheim to Bad Münster. It would be necessary to make fundamental changes to the Bad Münster am Stein station. Construction of the strategic line started in the summer in 1902. From 14 August 1902 materials for the construction of the railway were brought to Ulmet on a narrow gauge railway and by horse-drawn carts from Altenglan. Italian and Croatian construction workers prepared the subgrade from Altenglan to St. Julian. On 27 October of the same year, the Mannheim- based company Grün & Bilfinger started the construction of the section from St. Julian to Lauterecken. The Glan and a parallel road had to be moved at Niedereisenbach. Material obtained in digging a new bed for the Glan River was used for the construction of an embankment for the railway to prevent flooding. The work was carried out by day labourers from Italy. Due to weather conditions in December 1902, work had to be suspended until spring, 1903. The superstructure between Eschenau and Lauterecken was largely completed on 21 January 1904. Opening of the Glan Valley Railway on 1 May 1904 in Bad Münster As early as 1903, coal trains ran to the Nordfeld Consolidated Coal Mine on the Homburg–Jägersburg section, which had not yet been officially opened. The mine was connected by a branch line, the so-called Nordfeldbahn (northern light railway). However, the mine, along with the branch line was closed two years later due to its unprofitability. Finally, the Glan Valley Railway was opened over its entire length on 1 May 1904, including the newly built Homburg–Glan-Münchweiler, Altenglan–Lauterecken and Odernheim–Bad Münster am Stein sections. There were 26 intermediate stations along the new line.  First years of operation and the First World War (1904–1918) The new line provided a continuous connection from Homburg via Glan-Münchweiler, Altenglan, Lauterecken-Grumbach and Odernheim to Bad Münster am Stein. The line was originally double track to meet its military requirements as a strategic railway. Altenglan station was rebuilt during the building of the line at the rail junction with diverging platforms and a new entrance building was built. The old Lauterecken station was unsuitable for the junction with the Lauter Valley Railway due to its location on the southern outskirts and it was demoted to a halt and a new Lauterecken-Grumbach station was opened in 1904 as a junction station. It was built immediately to the north of a halt that had opened in 1896 on the Lauter Valley Railway and was closed at the same time as the opening of the new junction station. The connection of the line to Bad Munster am Stein happened against the background that the Palatinate Railway (Pfalzbahn), which had absorbed the Palatine Northern Railway Company in 1870, wanted to compete with the Prussian Nahe Valley Railway. So the Glan Valley Railway ran from Odernheim on the right bank of the Nahe river almost parallel with the Nahe Valley Railway on the other side of the river. The Nahe Valley Railway had a significantly higher volume of traffic and the section of the Glan Valley Railway between Odernheim and Bad Münster was only important as a military railway. Eisenbach-Matzenbach station (formerly Matzenbach) in 1912 On 1 January 1909, the Glan Valley Railway was absorbed into the Royal Bavarian State Railways, along with the other railway lines in the Palatinate. During the First World War, the line served largely strategic purposes as planned. Already from 9 to 16 August 1914, the Glan Valley Railway was used by several military trains daily from the Poznań (then German Posen) region to the west. The timetable was changed eight times that year. At the same time, the provision for civilian traffic during the four years of war was limited. On 1 November 1917, the stations in Eschenau, Wiesweiler and Raumbach had to be temporarily abandoned due to lack of staff, but they had already been reactivated in October 1918. Weimar Republic (1919–1933) In the postwar period, the line was affected by damage as a result of the war, especially in the form of long travel times. In 1920, the Glan Valley Railway between Homburg and Jägersburg became part of the newly created Saar, which was controlled by the United Kingdom and France for a period of 15 years as a League of Nations mandate. This meant that Waldmohr station had customs and border controls. With the founding of Deutsche Reichsbahn in the same year, it took over the Glan Valley Railway to Schönenberg-Kübelberg and the Saar Railway (Saareisenbahn) was responsible for the remaining section to Homburg. Under the Versailles Treaty, the 1922 Conference of Ambassadors of the Allies demanded the dismantling of the Odernheim–Staudernheim line and the dismantling of one track on the remaining Glan Valley Railway. This provoked local resistance. Seven years later the German government agreed that only the Odernheim–Bad Münster section would be reduced to a single track and the Glan Valley Railway would still retain the status of a main line. It was also determined that the work would be completed within nine months from 1 September 1929 and accordingly work started on 12 November 1929, but this had no impact on the railway. In 1923 and 1924, so-called Regiebetrieb (\\"directed operation\\" of the railways by the Allied military during the Occupation of the Ruhr) was imposed under the control of France, which had occupied the Palatinate. The local population boycotted the railway during the occupation. Therefore, reinforced German Post Office bus routes and private trucks were used as an alternative to the French-controlled railways. In addition, the German Ministry of Transport refused to cooperate with the occupiers in the operation of the railway, so the French took rail operations into their own hands. Since the military officers involved did not fully understand the German operating instructions and the safe-working systems, railway operation during this time were hazardous. Third Reich and the Second World War (1933–1945) After the reunification of the Saar with Germany in 1935 following a referendum, the customs controls between Jägersburg and Schönenberg-Kübelberg were removed. Two years later, the Reichsbahndirektion (railway administration) of Ludwigshafen, to which the Glan Valley Railway had belonged, was dissolved. From Homburg to Altenglan, the line was controlled by the Reichsbahndirektion Saarbrücken and further north it was controlled by the Reichsbahndirektion Mainz. At the same time, the track master's office (Bahnmeisterei) in Altenglan was dissolved. In 1938, the second track was restored in preparation for the Second World War. The construction of the Siegfried Line (Westwall) and the transport of troops gave the railway line an important role during the whole course of the war. Between 24 and 27 September 1938, a military exercise was held in the Palatinate. Troop trains from Frankfurt were despatched to the stations of Altenglan, Bedesbach-Patersbach, Glan-Münchweiler, Lauterecken-Grumbach and Schönenberg-Kübelberg. With the outbreak of the Second World War, rail services were restricted again. Due to its strategic importance, the line was often the target of Allied air raids that destroyed, among other things, the engine shed in Lauterecken and Offenbach station. In the last months of the war, a connecting curve was constructed between Rammelsbach and Bedesbach in the current location of Altenglan to the north of the station. This was established as a possible detour in conjunction with the Türkismühle–Kusel railway opened in 1936 as an extension of the Landstuhl–Kusel railway in case the Nahe Valley Railway between Ottweiler and Bad Münster became blocked. In fact, however, it was only used once and dismantled immediately after the end of the war. Despite these attacks, the Glan Valley Railway in 1945 had suffered less damage than any other line between the Rhine and the Saarland, so it was used by many American military trains in 1945. Post-war period (1945–1960) Schönenberg-Kübelberg station Homburg and Jägersburg were included in the modern Saarland, which was separated again after the Second World War from the rest of Germany, so the stations of Jägersburg and Schönenberg-Kübelberg became customs stations again. The Homburg–Jägersburg section became part of the Saarland Railways (Saarländischen Eisenbahnen, SEB), and from 1951 the Railways of the Saarland (Eisenbahnen des Saarlandes, EdS), while the remaining part of the line was taken over by the Operations Association of the Southwest German Railways (Betriebsvereinigung der Südwestdeutschen Eisenbahnen, SWDE) until 1949, when Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) was founded. Already in 1945, the second track between Homburg and Jägersburg had been disconnected because it was no longer required for operational reasons and the rails could be used to repair other lines. The timetable for those sections that had been built as a strategic railway were continually thinned after the Second World War. Most notably, the Homburg–Glan-Münchweiler section was operated by a few pairs of trains that only served workers employed in the Saarland. The Glan Valley Railway at this time was the least used two-track line in southwestern Germany. The renewed separation of the Saar also led to traffic continuously declining on the Homburg–Glan-Münchweiler section of the line. The reason for this was that most of this line was in the newly created Rhineland-Palatinate and most traffic to the new state was concentrated towards Kaiserslautern. These structural changes had the effect, among other things, that the Homburg–Jägersburg section was officially listed as only a secondary line from 2 May 1955. The economic reintegration of the Saarland in Germany meant that customs controls in Schönenberg-Kübelberg were abolished in 1959, but starting in the 1950s, there continued to be further reductions in the capacity of the route. So Jägersburg station was closed for passenger by the Saarland administration in 1956 and the second track between Jägersburg and Schönenberg-Kübelberg was dismantled in 1960 because it was no longer used. Gradual closure (1960–2000) The decline of the line in the 1960s resulted in the gradual closure of the Glan Valley Railway. It began in October 1961 with the closure of the Odernheim–Bad Münster am Stein section, with operations continuing only between Bad Münster and the connection to the Niedernhausen power station. Operations ended on the section between Odernheim and the turnoff to the power station, but the tracks were maintained in their original condition until the 1980s. In addition, the second track was also gradually removed from the remaining parts of the line from the 1960s. In the following period the failure of DB to carry out additional rationalisation called into question the economics of the Glan Valley Railway because signalling and level crossing barriers still had to be operated manually and the safe-working systems still predominantly dated from the early days of the line. DB 515 547 in Meisenheim just before the end of passenger services between Lauterecken-Grumbach and Staudernheim in 1986 In 1977, weekend services ended on the Homburg–Glan-Münchweiler and the Altenglan–Staudernheim sections. On 30 May 1981, the last passenger train ran on the Homburg–Glan- Münchweiler section. Freight traffic had previously ended between Schönenberg- Kübelberg and Glan-Münchweiler. Traffic was discontinued between Altenglan and Lauterecken-Grumbach four years later and on the northern section to Staudernheim in 1986. The transport of freight between Waldmohr and Schönenberg-Kübelberg ended on 1 July 1989. In the same year, the section between Glan-Münchweiler and Altenglan was reduced to one track. The section from Bad Münster to the Niedernhausen power station was used for both freight operations and occasional special passenger trips until late 1990 when it was closed. Since 1993, the route from Bad Münster to the former Duchroth station has been used as a cycle path. Freight traffic finally ended between Lauterecken and Meisenheim on 1 March 1993. Two years later freight traffic ended between Homburg and Waldmohr. The Lauterecken-Grumbach–Staudernheim section was officially closed in 1996.  Current developments (since 2000) Newly built tunnel on the former tracks between Schönenberg-Kübelberg and Elschbach The only part of the former Homburg–Bad Münster strategic railway that is still in operation is the Glan-Münchweiler–Altenglan section of the original Landstuhl–Kusel line. This is operated by Regionalbahn services. Students of the Kaiserslautern University of Technology proposed the establishment of a draisine operation on the Altenglan–Staudernhein section of the line to prevent its final closure and the dismantling of its track. The supporters of this project included a councillor of Kusel district, Winfried Hirschberg. After an examination of the draisine lines in Templin in Brandenburg—at that time the only one in Germany—and near Magnières in Lorraine, detailed planning began, which was implemented in 2000. In its first year of operation, the project had 7,300 users. This was significantly higher than expected. The Waldmohr–Glan-Münchweiler and Odernheim am Glan–Bad Münster sections are now dismantled. On the Waldmohr–Glan-Münchweiler section and on much of the route of the dismantled second track between Odernheim and Glan- Münchweiler, the Glan-Blies Way cycling and hiking trail was built from 2001 to 2006. A new tunnel was built between Schönenberg-Kübelberg and Elschbach to take the trail under state road 356. Route The southern section from Homburg to Glan-Münchweiler branches off the Mannheim–Saarbrücken line and initially runs through the Bruch country. The line crosses the vast Jägersburger Wald (Jägersburg forest) and touches Waldmohr and Schönenberg- Kübelberg, which is located on the northern edge of the Peterswald (forest). A few kilometres later the line reaches the Glan valley, which the line now follows to Odernheim. Between Homburg and Glan-Munchweiler the line crosses the Glan river four times because of the large meanders in its upper reaches and one of its loops is shortened by the Elschbach tunnel. After Lauterecken, the river valley widens considerably, so there are fewer bridges. Shortly before Meisenheim, the Glan Valley Railway runs through Meisenheim tunnel. Battery railcars on the Nahe bridge of the Glan Valley Railway near Staudernheim The line forks at Odernheim. A branch opened in 1897, which still exists, runs in a wide arc and ends near the Disibodenberg in Staudernheim. The southern branch, which was built for strategic reasons and is now dismantled, passed through the Kinnsfels tunnel to the Nahe valley near the Gangelsberg (mountain) and passes on the right bank of the Nahe parallel to the Nahe Valley Railway, which ran on the other side, and reaches Bad Münster by a bridge over the river. In terms of landscape, most of the line from Schönenberg-Kübelberg to Odernheim runs through the North Palatine Uplands, where it has been dismantled between Waldmohr and Glan-Münchweiler. The northern part of the line between Odernheim and Bad Münster then runs through the Naheland. From Homburg to Jägersburg the railway runs through the, Saar- Palatinate district of the Saarland. With the exception of Elschbach which is part of the district of Kaiserslautern, the line to Odenbach then runs through the Kusel district. The northern part between Meisenheim and Staudernheim or Bad Münster am Stein respectively is located in the district of Bad Kreuznach. Characteristics The Glan Valley Railway almost continuously loses height as it runs to the north, only between Homburg and Jägersburg and between Odernheim and Staudernheim are there slight climbs to the north. Between Schönenberg-Kübelberg and Glan-Munchweiler the ruling gradient was 1:100, the remaining gradient ranged from 1:144 (between Jägersburg and Schönenberg- Kübelberg) and 1:1143 (between Bedesbach-Patersbach and Ulmet). Despite the sparse population of the region, the line had a high density of stations. This was the main reason for the low passenger volumes at each station, which ultimately led to the closure of sections. Chainage Since the Glan- Münchweiler–Altenglan section originated as part of the Landstuhl–Kusel line and the Lauterecken–Staudernheim section was originally a continuation of the Lauter Valley Railway, the two sections originally had the chainages of those lines, so that their zero chainage points were at Landstuhl or Kaiserslautern respectively. After the opening of the strategic line in 1904, a continuous chainage was introduced starting in the west from Scheidt and running over the line to Rohrbach, which was completed in 1879 and 1895, and continuing to Homburg over the line via Kirkel and Limbach, which was opened on 1 January 1904 and then transferred to the Glan Valley Railway. As a result, the chainage of Bad Münster am Stein station was set at 109.7 km. The Odernheim–Staudernheim section originally had a separate chainage, but was it later given a chainage that continued on from the chainage between Scheidt and Odernheim. The chainage of the endpoint of the line at Staudernheim was set at km 96.9.Map of the Reichsbahndirektion Mainz of 1 January 1940 Since the Scheidt–Homburg section was part of the shortest connection between Saarbrücken and Homburg, it became part of the Mannheim–Saarbrücken line and later a new chainage was established for the Glan Valley Railway as far as Altenglan with the zero point at Homburg. North of Altenglan station the old chainage from Scheidt was maintained, so that there is a jump from 33.1 km to 56.9 km at Altenglan.

This omission, constituting negligence, led to the death of one of them. He was convicted of culpable homicide.  Facts  Russell, the accused, was charge before a magistrate of culpable homicide arising out of the electrocution of Aaron Masenyetsi, a black male employee at Ngagane Railway Station. It appeared from the evidence that on June 23, 1966, the accused, a white male carpenter employed in the Department of Water Affairs, was assisting one Mostert, the crane operator in charge of loading pipes onto a lorry from a crane fitted on the back thereof, also an employee of the Department. Overhead was an electric wire. Whilst Mostert and his black assistants, including the deceased, were not present, the shunter, in accordance with his duty to warn all workmen present, had informed the accused that the current was about to be switched on, and that he would be advised when it was switched off, so that they could proceed with the loading. The deceased omitted to inform Mostert thereof on his return, and the loading continued. The top of the crane touched the wire and the deceased was electrocuted and died.  Judgment  In a review of a conviction of culpable homicide, Van Heerden J cited Silva's Fishing Corporation (Pty.) Ltd v Maweza,1957 (2) SA 256 (A). where Steyn CJ, who delivered the minority judgment, after referring to certain remarks made by Innes ACJ and Wessels JA, in Halliwell v Johannesburg Municipal Council, stated as follows: > From these remarks it may fairly be gathered that an omission does not > entail delictual liability where there is no legal duty to act, that > generally speaking such a duty will arise from a prior act or from prior > conduct, but that it could also arise from some other source, one such > possible source being a statute. If the true sense of those judgments is a > more restricted one, viz. that an omission unconnected with prior conduct is > always to be regarded as a mere omission, i.e. as a failure to do what the > person concerned is not bound to do, I must, with great deference, disagree > with it. The Roman law, as also the Roman-Dutch law, recognises the > principle that, generally speaking, no one is bound to mind the business of > another, even where he can, with no danger or expense to himself, avert > serious harm from the other, and that no liability is incurred by refraining > from doing so, even if the omission should violate a moral duty [....] But > there is a variety of circumstances, some of them unconnected with prior > conduct, which impose the duty to act in order to avoid reasonably > foreseeable loss to another. The circumstances which will give rise to such > a duty may differ according to the conceptions prevailing in a particular > community at a given time.264. In Rex v Meiring,1927 AD 41. Innes CJ had stated as follows: > Now negligence can never be disentangled from the facts; but its existence > is best ascertained by applying to the facts of each case the standard of > conduct which the law requires. And that standard is the degree of care and > skill which a reasonable man would exercise under the circumstances.45. In Cape Town Municipality v Paine,1923 AD 207. Innes CJ added the following: > It has repeatedly been laid down in this Court [the Appellate Division] that > accountability for unintentioned injury depends upon culpa—the failure to > observe that degree of care which a reasonable man would have observed. I > use the term reasonable man to denote the diligens paterfamilias of Roman > law—the average prudent person. Every man has a right not to be injured in > his person or property by the negligence of another—and that involves a duty > on each to exercise due and reasonable care. The question whether in any > given situation a reasonable man could have foreseen the likelihood of harm > and governed his conduct accordingly is one to be decided in each case upon > a consideration of all the circumstances. Once it is clear that the danger > would have been foreseen and guarded against by the diligens paterfamilias, > the duty to take care is established, and it only remains to ascertain > whether it has been discharged.216. Van Heerden J found, on the basis of these and other authorities, that the accused in casu, by the manner of his acceptance of the warning in Mostert's absence, had created a potentially dangerous position, and that thereafter there was a duty on him to pass on the warning to Mostert and his co-employees who were engaged on the same project, and who might reasonably be unaware of the danger; and that his failure to do so constituted negligence. It was the accused's negligence, accordingly, which had caused the death of the deceased: \\"It accordingly follows, in my opinion, that the conviction and sentence were in accordance with justice and that they should both be confirmed by this Court.\\"  See also  * South African criminal law  References  * S v Russell 1967 (3) SA 739 (N).

Career Born in Chiswick, London, Moore represented London and Middlesex as a schoolboy and joined First Division side Brentford as a junior after leaving school. The club wanted Moore to sign a professional contract, but the suspension of competitive football due to the breakout of the Second World War in 1939. During the war, Moore guested with Manchester City, Derry City and along with other serving footballers Bill Baxter, Bobby Mitchell and John Aston, won a cup final with Australian club Canterbury- Bankstown, played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. After the war, Moore received interest from First Division side Wolverhampton Wanderers, but returned to Brentford after Harry Curtis offered him a professional contract. Moore made his Brentford debut on 10 May 1947 in a 1–0 defeat against Bolton Wanderers in the First Division, the first full season following World War II. Behind Archie Macaulay in the pecking order, Moore only made four appearances for the club and played his last game in a 3–0 defeat at Luton Town in the Second Division on 3 September 1947. He saw out his time with the Bees in the reserve team. On leaving Brentford, Moore turned down a move to Second Division side Leeds United and signed for Gloucester City in the Southern League, where he made 52 appearances and scored 13 goals during the 1948–49 season before joining fellow Southern League club Colchester United at the end of the season for a fee of £1,000. Moore was signed as an understudy to Harry Bearryman, and made his first-team debut on 8 September 1949 in a 3–1 away defeat at Chingford Town. He was unable to displace Bill Layton from the first-team and by January 1950 was made captain of the reserve team. He made 13 Southern League appearances for the club, helping the team finish as runners-up in the league and gain election to the Football League. In the Football League, Moore did not make an appearance during Colchester's inaugural 1950–51 season, but made two appearances for the club in 1951–52. Moore left Layer Road in the summer of 1952 following his final game on 5 January 1952, a 7–0 demolition by Leyton Orient at Brisbane Road. He joined Yeovil on trial in October of the same year but after a fortnight returned to London, looking for a club closer to his home. He later played for Staines Town and Hastings United, the latter club managed by his brother-in-law Ted Ballard.  Personal life  Moore attended Chiswick School and during the Second World War, he served in the Fleet Air Arm. After his retirement from football, Moore became a car salesman. In August 1997, at age 74, he was working as a chauffeur.

Main characters   Spencer Wright  (voiced by Rasmus Hardiker) Spencer is a 14-year-old boy and the protagonist of the series. He is a budding filmmaker and makes his own amateur movies on a regular basis and aspires to be a famous film director. Spencer is particularly fond of horror-and-gore movies, with nearly all of his own movies having to do with either zombies or monsters in some way. Spencer wears a blue guitar pick necklace that used to belong to Billy in order to see him. Because he is fairly new to Beverly Heights and is very different from the norm (in that he isn't rich, trendy, or the 'Hollywood type') he clashes with many people at his school and has garnered a number of enemies (Principal Ponzi, Lolo, & Kleet) although he receives help dealing with them from Billy. Likewise, Spencer helps Billy by protecting him from his enemies, like Madame X and Hoover. He also normally has to help solve problems caused by Billy as well, mostly pertaining to the effects of his ectoplasm and/or general antics.  Billy Joe Cobra  (voiced by Darren Foreman) Billy is a fun-loving, mischievous, energetic, funny, hyperactive, and crazy ghost and Spencer's best friend. Before he died, he was an enormously famous pop-star, and is still very popular posthumously. He cannot be seen or heard by others unless they are wearing a personal item that belonged to him before he died (such as Spencer's necklace). Billy's personality consists of both a bro-centric best friend and a stereotypical narcissistic celebrity. He tries to help Spencer with his movies and fit in more with life in Hollywood, although many of his efforts normally cause more problems. He often describes his days as a rock star, in which it is shown that he was extremely difficult to work with (showing up to a video shoot 2 days late and refusing to perform because he didn't like the camera man's jeans), loved to trash hotel rooms and wreck music video shoots, and treated his crew and staff horribly. He can also be somewhat temperamental, especially when someone insults him or his music. Nearly every one of Billy's songs involve him singing about how much he loves himself or how much everyone else loves him (\\"I'm Still in Love With Me\\", \\"I Am the Sunshine of My Life\\", \\"You Love Me, I Love Me More\\", etc.) although sometimes they are about things related to stereotypically extravagant lifestyles (\\"Big Yachts and Money\\"). Billy is extremely wealthy: possessing a custom limo, several private jets, planes, and yachts, a pet crocodile, and the large mansion that Spencer's family now live in. Billy's ghost body allows him to phase through objects and people, stretch his limbs, and transform into various things. He also has a number of powers, including the ability to possess people, instantly travel through computers and televisions, and telekinesis. Billy's most frequently-referred-to power (although one he has very limited control over) is the ectoplasm that his body is able to secrete. It is a blue, gooey substance that mutates or changes whatever it touches. Its effects are very erratic and unpredictable; it has the capability to mutate a small fish into a deadly piranha, give a video game sentience, and grant someone the abilities of a ghost. Its effects, however, can normally be reversed. Billy regularly incorporates puns with the word \\"bro\\" into his vocabulary: (broaster oven, broham sandwich, George Bromero, Brohann Sebastian Bach, etc.) He does not share Spencer's love of horror movies, despite being a ghost; and is acrophobic, despite having the ability to fly. He also loves smooth peanut butter, but hates chunky. He is a distant cousin to the Wright family. His real name is Baruch Cohen (\\"School of Terror\\").  Major characters  * Rajeev Baguiati (Rasmus Hardiker) - Spencer's friend. He is an odd, goofy teenager and self-proclaimed ladies man and party animal. He is also Shanilla's brother. He is very clumsy, socially inept, and can be a rather bad friend at times (especially when he is chasing after Lolo). He is normally cast as the lead in all of Spencer's movies, despite being a rather lackluster actor. He wears a red-buckled belt that used to belong to Billy in order to see him. He has a very public crush on Lolo and is relentless in his pursuit of her affections, despite her constant rejections and proclaimed hatred of him. * Shanila Baguiati (Larissa Murray) - Spencer's friend and Rajeev's sister. She is much more level-headed than her brother and is often the voice of common sense between the two. She wears a pink bracelet that used to belong to Billy in order to see him. She also has a secret crush on Spencer. * Hugh Wright (Ewan Bailey) - Spencer's dad. He can be eccentric but is a very caring father. He works as an accountant but has a passion for inventing and tinkering with things. He is terrible with technology (especially computers). * Jane Wright - Spencer's mom. She is also eccentric but is normally more level-headed than Hugh. She also loves to style hair. Billy Joe Cobra's distant-cousin relationship to the Wrights has been implied to come from her side of the family. * Jessica Wright (Teresa Gallagher) - Spencer's 11-year-old sister. She is very athletic and even has a black belt in karate (which appears to be her favorite sport). She can be a bit annoying at times, and believes her brother is very weird for \\"talking to himself\\". * Mallory - (Teresa Gallagher) - A pretty, popular girl who Spencer has a crush on. She is extremely nice and friendly, and appears to like Spencer as well.  Antagonists  * Madame X (Larissa Murray) - A mysterious woman who is an extremely obsessed fan of Billy Joe Cobra. She has an enormous collection of BJC merchandise, pictures, and memorabilia, and makes it her mission to capture Billy and keep him in a jar, in order to complete her collection. She [and Hoover] appear to be the only other people (apart from Spencer and his friends) who are aware of Billy's existence and know how to see him. The upper portion of her face is always kept off-screen. * Sam Hoover (Steven Kynman) - A very short, bumbling ghost-catcher and Madame X's right-hand man. He frequently attempts to capture Billy with his ghost containment unit (usually through numerous disguises or tricks), but is never able to hold onto him for long—usually due to his own incompetence. Hoover wears a pair of underwear that used to belong to Billy in order to see him. His base of operations is a van that is normally parked outside Billy's mansion. * Principal Glenn Ponzi (Ewan Bailey) - The principal of Beverly Beverly High School. He is a strict and bitter man who hates Spencer (believing him to be \\"weird\\" and a delinquent) and regularly attempts to get him kicked out of school. In addition to this, he is also a big detractor of Billy's music, making him a frequent target of Spencer and Billy's pranks. He can normally be seen with his pet bird Lorenzo. He also has a crush on Spencer's teacher, Ms. Rumsfeld, although these feelings are not reciprocated. * Lolo Calorie - A rich, spoiled, popular girl with a stereotypical valley girl accent. She doesn't like Spencer or his friends, as they usually stand up to her conceited and 'popular' attitude or just plain annoy her (mostly via Spencer's horror movies or Rajeev's flirting). In \\"True Party\\", is it shown that she might actually like Rajeev, despite being mean to him and rejecting him all the time. * Kleet Klennerson (Darren Foreman) - A muscle-headed, dimwitted jock who enjoys bullying Spencer. He is a sports star at school and is very physically fit, but has the intelligence of a stereotypical jock and is normally outwitted by Spencer and Billy.  Minor characters  * Buck - (Steven Kynman) The owner of the Wi Fri. He seems to be friends with Spencer. * Kath Katherson (Teresa Gallagher) - A newscaster who frequently reports on events happening in Beverly Heights. * The Delivery Guy - A goofy delivery guy that normally ends up on the receiving end of Spencer and Billy's antics. * \\"The Soapies\\" - Three popular girls—Dorine, Morine, and Florine—who often hang out with Lolo. Their clique's nickname suggests they merely do this for popularity status. * iStevie - A short, nerdy looking student who is into high tech gadgetry. He communicates purely through beatboxing, which everyone else is somehow able to understand. * Adrian - Lolo's silent bodyguard/assistant who caters to her every whim. He usually ends up getting rid of Rajeev for her. * Buddy - (Steven Kynman) A popular student with a Southern accent. He appears to be an aspiring stuntman and makes frequent use of a giant cannon which he uses to launch himself out of. * Ms. Rumsfeld - Spencer's homeroom teacher. She appears to have been teaching for a very long time, as Principal Ponzi has admitted to being a former student of hers. She does not reciprocate his crush on her. * Lorenzo - Principal Ponzi's pet bird and companion. He even wears a mini-toupée and pair of glasses identical to Ponzi's. * Greg Slick - A celebrity/entertainment show host who reports on big pop culture-related news in Hollywood.

It was released by Fontana in 1972.  Background   Significance  This live concert was divided into two parts: the first acoustic folk, the second part being electric folk in a style then known as Celtic rock. The evening is a musical tour around the Celtic fringe, from Brittany northwards. It was broadcast live on one of the three radio stations in France (seven million listeners live on Radio Europe 1) Frédéric Jambon, « Stivell. Les 40 ans du concert mythique ce soir à l'Olympia », Le Télégramme, 16 février 2012 Alan Stivell was accompanied by Dan Ar Braz on guitar, Michel Santangelli (the future drummer for Jacques Higelin) on percussion, Gabriel Yacoub, René Werneer, Pascal Stive, Gérard Levasseur, Serj Parayre and Michaël Klec’h. Stivell à l'Olympia sold a staggering 1,500,000 copies in just over a year (more than 2 million thereafter) and put both Stivell and Breton music on the cultural map once and for allCD Olympia Concert on Discovery-records.com  Context and impact  1972, the year of its release, was one of radical ferment at home and abroad. The widespread revolt of May 1968 had generated a \\"back to the earth\\" movement amongst French students and intelligensia. The entry of Britain and Ireland into the EEC was seen by radicals in Brittany as the long-awaited opportunity to bring the Celtic nations together and make the ancient dream of Celtic unity a reality. Alan Stivell was closely identified with these trends, even at times hailed as a champion of one or the other cause, but he was himself, as he often later claimed, uneasy about taking on the role of a musical freedom fighter. His deep fascination with cutting edge technology, fuelled by his early love of science fiction put him at odds with any \\"back to the earth\\" idealism. Despite the hopes he shared with many of his fellow Breton for a Celtic cultural revival and unity, he always sought to avoid being straight-jacketed by a narrow traditionalist outlook. The electric ambiance of Alan Stivell and his musicians quickly spread like wildfire in France: Stivell had just launched the first \\"Breton wave\\". Music from Brittany also became extremely popular and the song Tri Martolod, which is still playing on the radio and in our memories, became the battle flag for an entire generation.Rate your music  Track listing  Lyrics and musics are traditionals arranged by Alan Stivell except \\"The Wind of Keltia\\" written by Alan Stivell and Steve Waring.

It was the second stage station on the Sidney-Black Hills Trail, when coming north from the Union Pacific railroad at Fort Sidney, Nebraska, on the way to gold mining fields in South Dakota. It played a significant role along the trail, serving travellers as a hotel, restaurant, and stable, as well as furnishing fresh horses for stagecoaches. The archaeological site at the station's former location, denoted 25MO32, is a historic archaeological site that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.

The tracks Spartacus and Last Unicorn were included, as well as a live version of Raise your fist and a bonus track Wrecking ball. The band split up shortly thereafter in 2010 due to unknown reasons. Unable to promote their new album, it was tucked away for a select audience. Recently, in 2013 they released a new EP named Large hadron collider spider featuring an artwork cover and five metal-tracks, including a title song. The EP got a good review on metalstorm and one from infernal masquerade, saying 'this EP is by far better than most of the mainstream Heavy Metal that was produced in the last 10 years'. Musical style Sons of Lioth's most recognizable features are the titanium lead voice, easy-listening arrangements and screaming guitar solos.

Common copyright formalities include copyright registration, copyright renewal, copyright notice, and copyright deposit. Benefits and critiques Copyright formalities had certain benefits to users and holders of copyrights. First, they made determination of copyright status fairly easy. Copyright notice requirements—such as placing a notice of copyright on the work itself, along with the copyright holder, and the date of copyright—meant that any work could readily be determined to be in copyright simply by looking for the copyright notice. Copyright registration and renewal requirements meant that records of copyright owners were centrally located and made available; this facilitated licensing arrangements, and contacting the holders. It also provided authoritative records about who owned the copyright, in case of disputes. However, copyright formalities were viewed as an unnecessary burden on creators—mostly authors at the end of the 19th century. Authors who failed to comply with some particular aspect of a formality—for instance, placing the notice in the wrong place or in the wrong order, or failing to renew a copyright in a timely fashion—would lose their copyright. Consequently, Victor Hugo and other authors agitated for the elimination of copyright formalities toward the end of the 19th century. In response to their efforts, the 1908 Berlin text of the Berne Convention forbade treaty signatories from conditioning copyright on formalities, shifting copyright from a system of application (registration) to automatic copyright on fixation.  Shift away from formalities Requirements for meeting copyright formalities were largely eliminated in many countries with the adoption of the Berne Convention, which granted a copyright for a creative work automatically as soon as the work was \\"fixed\\". Berne was first adopted in 1886 by eight countries, mostly in Europe. Acceptance grew over the course of the 20th century. (See List of parties to the Berne Convention.) The United States, a notable late holdout, joined Berne effective March 1, 1989, with the passage of the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988; China, another notable holdout, joined Berne in 1992.See List of parties to the Berne Convention. With the adoption of Berne and its successor treaties, requiring formalities to obtain a copyright has fallen out of practice around the world.  Renewed interest in formalities However, the system of automatic copyright on fixation has been cited as one of the factors behind the growth of the so-called \\"orphan works\\" problem. For instance, the U.S. Copyright Office's 2006 report on orphan works cited the shift away from formalities as one of the critical factors behind the creation of orphan works.United States Copyright Office, Copyright Office's Report on Orphan Works (2006). Consequently, some scholars and policy advocates (such as law professor and activist Lawrence LessigSee for example, Free Culture by Larry Lessig. and U.S. Representative Zoe Lofgren) have called for returning to a system of registration requirements and possibly other formalities such as copyright notice. UC Berkeley's Law School held a conference in 2013 on the question of \\"Reform(aliz)ing Copyright for the Internet Age?\\", noting that > \\"Formalities, which in the past three decades have largely disappeared from > American copyright law, may be about to stage a comeback. ...

At first he joined the Revolutionary Socialist Workers' Party (POSR), which in 1902 merged into the French Socialist Party (PSF), which in turn merged into the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) in 1905. Garchery joined the French Communist Party (PCF) upon its foundation in 1920 and represented the PCF in the Chamber of Deputies from 1924 to 1928. Having been excluded from the PCF in 1929, he was among the founders of the Workers and Peasants Party (POP), which in 1930 merged into the Proletarian Unity Party (PUP). In 1937 the PUP merged into the SFIO. Garchery was a member of the Chamber of Deputies for a second time from 1932 to 1940. On 10 July 1940, he voted in favour of granting the Cabinet presided by Marshal Philippe Pétain authority to draw up a new constitution, thereby effectively ending the French Third Republic and establishing Vichy France. Mostly because of this vote, Garchery was excluded from the SFIO in November 1944, along with a number of other SFIO politicians. In 1945 he joined the newly founded Democratic Socialist Party (PSD).

He was also the founder of the Italian Unionist Movement, a short- lived anti-Communist political party that existed from 1944 to 1948. It advocated a federal union between Italy and the United States. Journalism and other writings Originally from Scilla, Calabria, in 1926 Paladino founded Sirena, a literary journal and magazine concentrating on Sicilian and Calabrian culture. He also wrote on miscellaneous topics, including a manual entitled How to write and co-write a film script: Theoretical and practical guide (1943). Shakespeare authorship John Florio, 1611. Engraving by William Hole from the 2nd edition of Florio's dictionary. According to Paladino John produced the final versions of the plays originally created by his father. Paladino first suggested that Michelangelo Florio was the author of Shakespeare's works in 1927.Friedman, E & The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined, Cambridge University Press, 2011, pp.7-8. His views were first put forward in the fascist literary journal L'Impero in February of that year.\\"Another Shock for Us: Shakespeare Claimed as an Italian\\", The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser, 25 January 1928, p.7. His arguments were presented in full in the booklet Shakespeare sarebbe lo pseudonimo di un poeta italiano (1929). In the same year he founded the Accademia Shakespeariana to promote his views. However, it was dissolved in the following year by the local authorities. Its aims were declared contrary to public policy by the fascist government. Paladino's documents were confiscated and the sale of his book banned.Wadsworth, F., The Poacher from Stratford, University of California Press, 1958, p.143. Paladino's theory is linked to the argument put forward by other \\"anti-Stratfordians\\" that Shakespeare's work shows an intimate knowledge of Italian culture and geography. He argued that Florio was a Sicilian Calvinist who had been forced to move to England to avoid persecution by the Catholic church. He invented the name Shakespeare by translating his mother's maiden name, Crollalanza, into English. Hermann W. Haller describes the 1929 booklet as \\"a pamphlet rife with fantasy and historical distortions\\".Hermann W. Haller, John Florio: A Worlde of Wordes, University of Toronto Press, 2013, p.xxxvi. Frances Yates called it an \\"astonishing work\\", containing claims that Florio had travelled to Spain, Austria, Athens, France and Denmark, but providing \\"no authority\\" for these assertions. According to Yates, Paladino's argument was somewhat weakened by the fact that he confused Michelangelo with his son John Florio.Frances A. Yates, John Florio: The Life of an Italian in Shakespeare's England, CUP Archive, 1934, pp.17-18. Much of Paladino's argument rests on the similarity of verses in the book Second Fruits to lines from Hamlet. In fact the book is by John, not Michelangelo. After World War II, Paladino's ideas were revived by Carlo Villa in a novel published in 1951. Villa supplemented the novel with an essay arguing for Florio's authorship. In Villa's version Florio becomes Shakespeare quite literally, after he is adopted by John Shakespeare.\\"The Year's Contribution to Shakespeare Studies\\", Shakespeare Survey, Volume 6, p.160. \\"Friderico Georgi\\" (Franz Saalbach) also published a book promoting the hypothesis.Friderico Georgi, William Shakespeare, Alias Mercutio Florio, 1954 After this, Paladino revived his ideas, adapting his theory to address his original confusion between the Florios. In Un italiano autore delle opere shakespeariane (1955) he argued that Michelangelo and John Florio had worked together on the plays, Michelangelo writing the original version in Italian and John perfecting the English-language translation.Campbell, Oscar James, ed. (1966). A Shakespeare Encyclopedia. London: Methuen, p.234. The duo then entered into a \\"secret agreement\\" with the actor William Shakespeare to give him \\"temporary or permanent\\" credit for the published works.Santi Paladino, Un Italiano autore delle opere shakespeariane, Milan, Gastaldi, 1955, p.110. Variations on Paladino's views have been developed by other, mostly Italian, writers, including Martino Iuvara (2002), Lamberto Tassinari (2008) and Roberta Romani (2012). Politics On October 12, 1944, while Allied armies occupied Italy, Paladino joined with the former fascist sociologist Corrado Gini and statistician Ugo Damiani to found the anti-Communist Italian Unionist Movement. The party argued that the Government of the United States should absorb all free and democratic nations worldwide, thereby transforming itself into a world government based in Washington DC. Italy would initiate the process by joining the U.S.A. as its 49th state. This would eventually expand to produce a world government. The party was set up in the context of the Sicilian Independence Movement of the time. Its programme was in opposition to the \\"Party of Reconstruction\\", which claimed 40,000 members in 1944, and campaigned for Sicily to be admitted as a U.S. state. Paladino wanted Italy to remain internally unified in a federal union with America. Paladino stated, \\"With a federation of the United States, Italy and some other nations, and a lot of atomic bombs, there would be no wars. This would solve all of Italy's problems.\\" Paladino argued that closer union with America was necessary to counter the advance of Communism under Soviet Russian leadership.\\"Italy: The 49th State\\", Time, Monday, Apr. 15, 1946. Paladino became a leading Italian advocate of federal world government, attending the Montreux Congress of the World Movement in 1947.Joseph Preston Baratta, The Politics of World Federation: From world federalism to global governance Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004, p.337. However, the movement was unsuccessful in Italy. After several electoral failures the party disbanded in 1948. Science fiction and later work In the 1950s he wrote science fiction, notably a series of short stories he published in 1957, using the pseudonym \\"Delta Billy\\".Santi Paladino His sci-fi story Oltre l'Apocalisse (Beyond the Apocalypse) was published in the series Narratori dell'Alpha-tau. Archivi del futuro (Irsa Muraro Publishing).Scheda sul romanzo \\"Oltre l'Apocalisse\\" in The Internet Speculative Fiction Database. He also wrote L'avventura di Mary (Mary's Adventure) in 1958 and L'invasione della Terra (Invasion of Earth) in 1960. Paladino continued to publish until shortly before his death. His last work was Perché credo in Dio (Why Believe in God), published in 1980.

The court expressed negatively the idea of a proximate cause, with the statement that there must be no novus actus interveniens between X's conduct and Y's death; it also expressed it positively, in the contention that Y's death must follow directly from X's conduct.

The occurrence of the characteristic red hue is the result of a number of factors. Sulfur dioxide emitted from nearby Mount Iō (硫黄山 iōzan) is oxidized to form diluted sulfuric acid, which is absorbed through the soil into the plant and used as anthocyanins. Other factors include the plateau's high level of rainfall, the temperature decrease in autumn, and strong ultraviolet rays.荒木徳蔵 『宮崎の植物あれこれ』 宮日文化情報センター、2008年 Forestry in the surrounding hills consists of Japanese red pine trees (Pinus densiflora).

History  Ebino Eco-Museum Center A foot bath, restaurant and gift shop, situated at a popular start and end point for hikers. According to a common theory, Ebino Plateau was named for the susuki grass fields that bloom red in autumn. The color can be likened to that of shrimp, which are called “ebi” (蝦) in Japanese. However, whether this is true or not is unknown, and an alternate theory suggests that the etymology of the name comes from the area being at the foot of the volcanic Mount Karakuni, which overlooks Kagoshima Bay. If this version were to be taken as true, the name would still have been be read as “ebino” (江火野), but originally written with characters meaning “bay” (江), “fire” (火) (taken from the word “volcano” (火山)), and “field” (野).柏木有興 「大辞典からみたえびの市の地名考」 えびの市史談会編・発行 『えびの 第27号』 1993年 During the mid-10th century, the Buddhist monk Shoku (性空 shōkū) went to Ebino Plateau to train. The Shimazu clan (島津氏) were also known to frequently visit the area. Sulfur mining has been carried out in the vicinity of Mount Io since the Edo period. Since the 1950s, Miyazaki Prefecture (宮崎県 miyazaki ken) has worked to develop Ebino Plateau as one of its key tourist destinations. Though originally there were only cabins designed to accommodate sulfur miners, in 1951 many Russian-style mountain huts were built around Fudo Lake (不動池 fudō ike) and began to attract hikers. Prefectural lodgings and a prefectural road leading from the town of Iinomachi (飯野町 īnomachi) were both opened in 1953.「観光と登山」 『霧島山総合調査報告書』 Access was improved in 1958, when the North Kirishima Toll Road （県道1号） was opened.

Known as the Kirishima Plateau Hotel (霧島高原ホテル) at the time, it was developed as a health resort. Initially, there was little public awareness of these tourism developments. This began to change when the western regional director of the now-defunct Japanese National Railways (日本国有鉄道 nihon kokuyū tetsudō) visited the area, and affectionately nicknamed the local express train \\"Ebino\\".

The film was directed by Camille Delamarre and written by Luc Besson, Robert Mark Kamen and Bibi Naceri. It is a remake of the 2004 French film District 13, in which Belle had also starred. Brick Mansions was released on April 25, 2014, five months after Walker's death on November 30, 2013 and has a dedication to him at the start of the credits. This was Walker's penultimate film, followed by his final film appearance in Furious 7. Plot In 2018, in a dystopian Detroit, abandoned brick mansions from better times house dangerous criminals. Unable to control the crime, city officials built a colossal, 40-foot-tall containment wall around this area, known as Brick Mansions, \\"the projects\\", or the \\"no go zone\\", to protect the rest of the city. Police monitor all movement in and out of Brick Mansions, and schools and hospitals within it have been shut down. For undercover cop Damien Collier (Paul Walker), every day is a battle against corruption after the death of his father. For French-Caribbean ex-convict Lino (David Belle), every day is a fight to live an honest life. Lino is hunted by drug kingpin Tremaine Alexander for stealing a massive amount of heroin and emptying it down a bathtub. Lino evades capture and so Tremaine has his men capture Lino's girlfriend, Lola. Lino attempts to free her and together they manage to escape and capture Tremaine in the Projects, turning him in to police at the border wall. However, Lino is shocked when the police free Tremaine and arrest him instead; it turns out that the police have long been in Tremaine's pay. While arrested, Lino kills a police official in a failed attempt to escape. In the meantime, city officials have discovered that Tremaine has gained hold of a nuclear explosive and a small missile, which he plans to launch into downtown Detroit unless he obtains a ransom. Damien is sent undercover as a prisoner in order to free Lino so that the two can destroy the bomb together. Together, the two manage to escape from a police van. In the beginning they fight each other, both verbally and physically, but they eventually decide to work together - though not before Lino deduces that Damien is actually an undercover cop. Together the two face off against Tremaine and his gang in order to free Lola and defuse the bomb. As they are set to defuse the missile, Damien discovers that Tremaine was bluffing and never planned to actually launch it - and that Damien was sent not to defuse the missile but to unknowingly launch it, not into downtown Detroit but into Brick Mansions itself, in order to kill its inhabitants and clear the entire area for upscale development. Damien also finds out from Tremaine that his father was not killed by criminals but by his fellow officers, and that the mayor of Detroit was behind both plots. Damien, Lino and Tremaine confront the mayor at his office and get him to admit his plan - then reveal that they have been secretly recording his statements. The mayor is then arrested. Brick Mansions is welcomed back into the city, with Damien and Lino continuing their friendship. Tremaine runs for Mayor of Detroit, promoting the idea of equality and freedom. Cast Production Principal photography began on April 30, 2013, and the film was released in 2014 by EuropaCorp. Relativity Media distributed the film. Following Walker's death, the North American release was scheduled for February and French release for April 23. On February 6, 2014, Relativity and EuropaCorp announced a move to April 25, 2014 as a release date for the film, along with paying the cost of the film's world premiere and distribution. Release The first official trailer was released on February 13, 2014, featuring the DJ Snake and Lil Jon song \\"Turn Down for What\\". The second full trailer was released on March 20, 2014. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 25% based on 95 reviews, with an average rating of 4.43/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Choppily edited and largely bereft of plot, Brick Mansions wastes a likable cast on a pointless remake of the far more entertaining District B13.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 40 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F. Critic Jennifer Rodman, considered the film a \\"watered-down American version, similar in many forms...a huge disappointment\\". Andrew Pulver wrote in The Guardian, \\"to be honest, Brick Mansions is not a great film — it kind of skimps on the parkour, the main reason why anyone went to see District 13.\\" Varietys Justin Chang called the film \\"propulsively entertaining\\" but was critical of the \\"aggressive cutting technique\\" which fails to allow audiences to fully appreciate the stuntwork and movements of the actors. Mick Lasalle of The San Francisco Chronicle wrote, \\"The movie itself makes that impossible to forget. There are cars all over the movie - car chases, car crashes, crazy driving, a scene of Walker hanging from a speeding car, and even a scene of Walker and another guy going 80 miles an hour when the brakes and the steering give out.

Her co-workers denied under oath that there was any assault, and testified in court that Gali consented to have sex with them. They allege that her injuries were caused by her falling whilst dancing on a table.  Jail period  Following the alleged rape, Gali contacted an Australian consular officer in neighbouring Dubai. She was not warned that unproven rape complaints could lead to sex outside marriage charges under the local law. Gali had reported the alleged rape to the local police. However, the men testified in court that the sex was consensual and no evidence could be provided that rape occurred.

The playhouse stands in rural Mount Carroll Township, Carroll County, Illinois, a short distance southeast of the town of Mount Carroll. It is located on the Timber Lake reservoir, on the east branch of Johnson Creek, near the Timber Lake resort. The playhouse is adjacent to the Timber Lake Campground and Resort. The current theatre structure was built and opened in June 1975, following a fire that destroyed the initial facility the previous year. The theatre is now outfitted with 371 fixed seats overlooking a 45-foot semi-thrust revolving stage. An additional 18 buildings on the ground serve various residence and preparation functions, including scene and costume shops and a large rehearsal pavilion. Beginning in 2018, Timber Lake Playhouse operates under a Category X agreement with Actors Equity Association (AEA). History The playhouse had its origins in the town-and-gown legacy of Shimer College, located at that time in Mount Carroll. Students, faculty members and their families, plus business and professional leaders from across 6 counties in northwestern Illinois, also 2 more in eastern Iowa, responded to planning and start-up enlistment by Andrew Bro, the college's chaplain and theatre director, and by Donald Mackay, owner of the Timber Lake properties and constructor of the reservoir. Frequent meetings led the expanding volunteer group to adopt by-laws, not-for-profit incorporation, board and committee formations, and by Thanksgiving weekend, 1961, to official groundbreaking. Bro was elected the first president of the corporation, but Mackay chose to be an independent advisor, a property lessor, and a philanthropic friend. For the initial 1962 season Bro was the de facto artistic director. Because he was working as a volunteer, he did not assume that title. He auditioned and hired a 24-member resident company, and staged two of the summer's eight productions, all but the final musical presented in a one-week, 5 performance schedule. With Mackay's sawmill help, locally milled hardwoods were used in constructing much of the original building. Containing a wide proscenium stage and 370 fixed seats donated by a nearby movie house, the theatre's opening night arrived on June 28, 1962 and eight more performances of Teahouse of the August Moon ensued. The original playhouse building was destroyed by fire in the early morning of July 22, 1974, shortly after a sold-out showing of Under the Gaslight. It was replaced by the current structure. In 2006, the company put on its first all-black production, Ain't Misbehavin', to sold-out crowds. In 2013, the company announced the first regional production of the Monty Python musical adaptation Spamalot. The company secured the rights in 2012, but was not allowed to announce this fact until May 2013.

Facts  The accused, charged with murder, had knifed a woman, thereby injuring a vein. The bleeding stopped, but a clot formed. The woman would probably have recovered in the ordinary course, but this course was interrupted when a medical practitioner decided to operate: a prudent decision but not a necessary one. The clot was disturbed during the operation; the woman haemorrhaged and bled to death.  Judgment  The court held that the burden of proof was upon the accused to show, on the probabilities, that there was an interruption of the causal chain. The court held that the causal chain had been broken, and that the Crown had failed to prove that the accused was responsible for the death of the deceased. The accused was convicted instead of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm.

It was first opened in 1947 with funding from the newly formed Arts Council of Great Britain. It is located in a Grade II listed town house in Looe Street, and includes space for exhibitions, a cinema, artist studios, a café and a bar. Beryl Cook had her first exhibition here, and many other artists held exhibitions here early in their careers. History Founded in 1947 in a Grade II listed town house in Looe Street, Plymouth Arts Centre was opened by art historian Kenneth Clark. The building is listed as part of a significant group of seventeenth and eighteenth century town houses in the street, many of which are listed. It is a three-storey building that at one time was used as a shop. It has a painted brick front and a steep slate half- hipped roof with deep moulded eaves. Plymouth Arts Centre was one of seven arts centres set up around the country with funds from the newly established Arts Council of Great Britain. The centre comprises gallery spaces, a 61-seater cinema, artist studios, café and bar space and receives over 70,000 visitors a year. The artist Beryl Cook had her first exhibition at Plymouth Arts Centre in 1975, and Bernard Samuels, then Director of the Plymouth Arts Centre, is credited with discovering her. In 2008, to celebrate its diamond jubilee, the centre had a retrospective exhibition, displaying an assortment of old programmes, photographs, posters, invitations and ephemera that had been stored for years in the attics at the centre. The archives have a gap, with a number of years missing between 1957 and the 1970s. The centre staff are hoping that these will turn up in somebody else's attic. Other artists who have held exhibitions in Plymouth Arts Centre include Patrick Heron, Tracey Emin, Allen Ginsberg, Tom Raworth, Peter Greenaway, Ralph Steadman, Vong Phaophanit, Richard Deacon, Andy Goldsworthy and Sir Terry Frost. Many people exhibited here at the start of their careers and went on to become household names. In 2018, Arts Council England defunded Plymouth Arts Centre and the Looe Street building was sold.

Early life The Honourable Charles Granville Fortescue was born on 30 October 1861, the sixth and youngest son of Hugh Fortescue, 3rd Earl Fortescue. Sir John Fortescue, the historian of the British Army, was his elder brother.Burke's Peerage and Baronetage 106th edn, 1999.Obituary, The Times (London) 3 February 1951. Fortescue was educated at Harrow School and was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Rifle Brigade on 22 January 1881, rising to lieutenant on 1 July that year.Hart's Army List 1904.Quarterly Army List, January 1919. Military career Fortescue saw his first active service with the 4th Battalion of his regiment in 1888–9 during the pacification operations in Upper Burma that followed the Third Anglo-Burmese War. Promoted to captain on 14 December 1890, he became adjutant of 4th Rifle Brigade in 1895. In 1897 he was employed by the Colonial Office in the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast, including an expedition to Karaga, receiving a Mention in Despatches and being appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. Having achieved the rank of major on 5 December 1898, he was also promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel on 8 July 1899. Fortescue returned from West Africa in 1899 to take up the post of private secretary to the Secretary of State for War, the Marquess of Lansdowne, but just before the outbreak of the Second Boer War he went to South Africa as a Brigade Major in the Natal Field Force under Sir George White. He was in the Siege of Ladysmith, and afterwards served as a staff officer in the operations in Northern Natal (including the action at Laing's Nek) and in Eastern Transvaal (including the actions at Belfast and Lydenburg). For the last six months of the war he relinquished staff work and commanded a column in the field. He was mentioned in despatches four times during the war and awarded the Distinguished Service Order. After the war ended, Fortescue stayed on for four months as military secretary to the general commanding the occupation force before returning to regimental duty. He left Port Natal on the SS Malta in late September 1902, together with other officers and men of the 2nd Battalion Rifle Brigade who were transferred to Egypt. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1911 Coronation Honours. In April 1912, Fortescue was appointed Brigadier General, General Staff (BGGS) in Eastern Command. On the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 he became BGGS to Third Army of Central Force within Home Forces, but shortly afterwards he was appointed to command a brigade of Regular Army troops returning from overseas garrisons for service on the Western Front. This became 80th Brigade in 27th Division and assembled around Winchester. The brigade included his old battalion, the 4th Rifle Brigade, returned from India, and the first Canadian volunteer unit to arrive in Europe, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry.Becke, Pt 1, pp. 97–103. The 27th Division landed in France in December 1914 and was concentrated by 25 December. In February 1915 it was holding the line near St Eloi, with localised fighting going on. On 28 February the 'Princess Pat's' carried out a successful local attack. On 14 March the Germans made a surprise attack on 80th Brigade in the late afternoon, firing two mines and capturing St Eloi village, the surrounding trenches, and an artificial heap of earth known as 'The Mound'. There was severe hand-to-hand fighting in which the 2nd King's Shropshire Light Infantry and 4th Rifle Brigade distinguished themselves, but Fortescue was unable to make an immediate counter-attack because no reserves were on hand. The neighbouring 82nd Brigade did make a counter-attack after midnight that included 4th King's Royal Rifle Corps of 80th Brigade and retook some of the ground, but the Germans had already consolidated their hold on The Mound.Edmonds & Wynne, pp. 30–1.Armchair General Shortly after St Eloi, Fortescue returned to Home Forces to take up the position of BGGS with First Army of Central Force. In November 1916 he received command of 212th Brigade of 71st Division, a new Home Defence formation composed of men who were unfit for overseas service. Once it had formed, 71st Division was assigned to guard the coast of Essex.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 101–5. After a year in command of 212th Brigade, Fortescue took over the 226th Mixed Brigade, which was attached to 71st Division. In January 1918 the War Office decided to break up the 71st Division by mid-March.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 75–82. Fortescue was then sent as part of a military mission to the Serbs fighting on the Macedonian front until the end of the war. Fortescue was awarded the Serbian Order of the White Eagle, 1st Class, with swords. He retired from the British Army on 31 October 1919 with the honorary rank of brigadier general.Quarterly Army List, January 1921 Part II. Family In 1906 Fortescue married Ethel Rosa, daughter of General Sir Charles Clarke, 3rd Baronet and widow of Captain Ernest Campbell. They had two daughters: * Anne Mary, born 17 July 1910, married 17 October 1929 to Henry Reginald Aked Garnett, who died in 1944. * Lilah Rose, TD, born 15 October 1912, who served in the Auxiliary Territorial Service during the Second World War. Before the First World War, Fortescue had accompanied his historian brother to some of the old battlefields of Europe, and he did a considerable amount of research for the last volume of Sir John's History of the British Army, which appeared in 1930. Charles Fortescue died on 1 February 1951. Notes References * Maj A.F.

The movement included such famous African-American writers as Richard Wright, Margaret Walker, Gwendolyn Brooks, Arna Bontemps, and Lorraine Hansberry, as well as musicians Thomas A. Dorsey, Louis Armstrong, Earl Hines and Mahalia JacksonKnupfer, Anne Meis (2006). The Chicago Black Renaissance and Women's Activism. Champaign, IL: University of Illinois Press Artists include William Edouard Scott, Elizabeth Catlett, Katherine Dunham, Charles Wilbert White, Margaret Burroughs, Charles C. Dawson, Archibald John Motley, Jr., and Eldzier Cortor. During the Great Migration, which brought tens of thousands of African-Americans to Chicago's South Side, African-American writers, artists, and community leaders began promoting racial pride and a new black consciousness, similar to that of the Harlem Renaissance. Unlike the Harlem Renaissance, the Chicago Black Renaissance did not receive the same amount of publicity on a national scale. Among the reasons for this are that the Chicago group participants did not present a singularly prominent \\"face\\", wealthy patrons were less involved, and New York City—home of Harlem—was the higher profile national publishing center. Development of the African American community in Chicago The Chicago Black Renaissance was influenced by two major social and economic conditions: the Great Migration and the Great Depression. The Great Migration brought tens of thousands of African Americans from the south to Chicago. Between 1910 and 1930 the African American population increased from 44,000 to 230,000. Before this migration, African Americans only constituted 2% of Chicago's population. African American migrants resided in a segregated zone on Chicago's south side, extending from 22nd Street on the north to 63rd Street on the south, and reaching from the Rock Island railroad tracks on the west to Cottage Grove Avenue on the east. This zone of neighborhoods was known as the \\"black belt\\" or \\"black ghetto.\\" African Americans saw Chicago, and other cities of the north, as a chance for freedom from legally sanctioned racial discrimination. Migrants mainly found work in meatpacking plants, steel mills, garment shops, and private homes. The Great Migration established the foundation of Chicago's African American industrial working class. When the stock market crashed in 1929 and the Great Depression resulted, thousands of people lost their jobs. African Americans were hit particularly hard. This catastrophe allowed for an emergence of new ideas and institutions among the black community. With a revitalized community spirit and sense of racial pride, a new black consciousness developed resulting in a shift toward social activism. African Americans on the south side coined the word Bronzeville, a word that described the skin tone of most its inhabitants, to identify their community. Music Jazz, blues, and gospel grew and flourished during the Chicago Black Renaissance. Jazz, which developed as a mix of European and African musical styles, began in the southeastern United States, but is said to have made its way from New Orleans to Chicago in 1915, when migrants came north to work in factories, mills, and stockyards. As more of the population moved north, the sound developed and grew in popularity. In 1922, Louis Armstrong followed his band leader Joe \\"King\\" Oliver to Chicago from New Orleans. He showed a unique talent for improvisation and quickly became jazz sensation. For 30 years, he defined jazz in Chicago. During that time, Chicago heard a number of jazz greats such as Earl \\"Fatha\\" Hines, Jelly Roll Morton, Erskine Tate, Fats Waller, and Cab Calloway. Blues also came to Chicago from the southeast during this period. In contrast to jazz, blues brought a somber tone of life and work in the Mississippi Delta. Towards the end of the Chicago Black Renaissance, Chicago started to change the sound of blues, adding drums, piano, bass, harmonica, and switching the acoustic guitar for electric. The new style was called Chicago Blues. Greats such as Chester Burnett, Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, and Koko Taylor were prominent during this time. Gospel, though popular before the Renaissance, saw a resurgence in prominence during this time. The \\"Father of Gospel Music,\\" Thomas Dorsey, brought hundreds of new gospel songs from the Southern Pentecostal Church to the public by blending the sound with urban style. Mahalia Jackson, the \\"Queen of Gospel Music,\\" made many of these songs mainstream when she arrived in Chicago in 1927. Literature The writing of the Chicago Black Renaissance addressed the culture of Chicago, racial tensions, issues of identity, and a search for meaning. Prominent writers in the movement included Richard Wright, Margaret Walker, Gwendolyn Brooks, Arna Bontemps, Fenton Johnson and Lorraine Hansberry. The South Side Writers Group was a writing circle of several authors and poets from the time of the Chicago Black Renaissance. Its members worked collaboratively to inspire one another and explore new themes. Newspapers and periodicals including the Chicago Defender, Chicago Sunday Bee, Negro Story Magazine, and Negro Digest also took part in supporting the literature of the Chicago Black Renaissance. These periodicals offered forums for writers of the movement to publish their work and also provided employment to many of these writers. Some of the well known literary works that emerged from the Chicago Black Renaissance include Wright's Native Son, Brooks' A Street in Bronzeville, St. Clair Drake and Horace R. Cayton's Black Metropolis, and Frank Marshall Davis' Black Man's Verse and 47th Street: Poems. Visual arts In addition to musicians and writers, several visual artists emerged during the Chicago Black Renaissance. Painters used different styles from portraiture to abstraction to reveal the thrills and grit of black life. Photographers also displayed daily life of south side Chicago through a variety of iconic American images. Four black artists, all of whom attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, are famous for sharing the vibrant spirit of black Chicago through their art: William Edouard Scott, Charles Wilbert White, Archibald John Motley, Jr., and Eldzier Cortor. Scott painted impressionist landscapes, portraits, and murals depicting black achievement, while White was a prominent graphic artist and worked with the mural division of the Illinois Federal Art Project. He was an active member of the South Side Community Art Center, which was founded by Margaret Burroughs, and his work, \\"There Were No Crops This Year,\\" won a first prize at the Negro Exposition in 1940. Motley's paintings, on the other hand, created controversy with his depictions of jazz culture and black sensuality, providing vivid images of urban black life in the 1920s and 1930s. Lastly, Cortor became famous for his delineation of the beauty of black women. In 1946, Life Magazine published one of his seminude female figures.  Archibald Motley's early life  Archibald J. Motley graduated from the Chicago Art Institute in 1918 with a concentration in portraiture. While at the Institute, Motley studied under Karl Buehr. When reflecting on his time and studied spent with Buehr, the artist goes onto say about his mentor that “a great influence on me not only as a painter but as a gentlemen, as a man”. As Motley began his career, he realized that working in portraiture was not very profitable. In one of Motley’s early works, “The Fisherman” it is extremely unexpressive and does not bear much resemblance to Archibald’s later work. The palette Motley uses in this portrait is very muted and realistic. A middle age man is sitting in a chair, looking out to the right, not making eye contact with the viewer. Not only is the subject matter different in Motley’s earlier paintings compared to his later, but as is his style. In his portrait of this fisherman, the brushstrokes are extremely visible and the man is very naturalistic unlike his later paintings where it is very animates and appears to look saturated. It can be seen in this early portrait the influence Buehr had on Motley. The artists focus on light, contours in the face, and texture can be attributed to his mentor. The tools and techniques Motley learned under Buehr can be seen in this early work. Motley graduated from the Art Institute in Chicago with the highest possible grades as well as recognition for “general excellence” in his work. As Motley began to paint and advance in his career, his artwork grew as well and transformed into a style much different than his earlier one.  Evolution of Motley's artwork throughout career  Motley began his artistic career with portraiture but as his career progressed, he moved into genre paintings. These later paintings depicted the lives of African Americans from areas like “the streets of Bronzeville” which is described as “the assorted African neighborhoods of Chicago’s South Side”. Motley got into the world of portrait painters because it was believed that due to the commercialism moving into art, portraits would always be in demand. Motley ran into trouble when he refused to conform to using his racial identity in his artistic work, “He insisted that the cause of black art could not be served ‘if all Negro artists painted simply Negro types’; rather ‘give the artist of the Race a chance to express himself in his own, individual way, but let him abide by the principles of true art, as our [white] brethren do.”. Portraiture was thought be a safe space for artists but Motley’s own artistic process forced him outside of this space. The move from portraits to genre scenes came because of Motley’s need to make money from his art. Although his portraits gave the people he painted a voice to express their own story, like “Mending Socks”, 1924, he was able to give a voice to those in the scenes of cabarets, pool halls, and the streets of African American neighborhoods with the added incentive of making money from these scenes. After spending a year in Paris, the style of modernism moved into his work. Along with his new knowledge of European modernism, he also started to incorporate elements of Impressionism, the colors of Fauvism and Expressionism, and the use of space in Cubism. Motley became more expressive in his works. His use of a vibrant color palette, distorted perspective, and the condensing of space breathed new life into his style of painting. These elements can be seen in Motley’s 1934 painting, “Blackbelt”.  Critiques  Many people have critiqued both Motley and other artists paintings from the Harlem and Chicago Black Renaissance. One reason is that they believe Motley exaggerated features of African Americans. In “The Liar,” the exaggeration critics comment on are perhaps the lips and how big they are, playing into the stereotypes of how certain people thought of African Americans. Additionally, it is thought that this exaggeration was meant to appeal to a certain audience. This was the white audience who during this time period were the main patrons during the Chicago Black Renaissance. He implemented certain caricature and stereotypes in his paintings to extend to this wider range of artists. By playing into these stereotypes, it could be seen as problematic as he was enforcing stereotypes that had been generalized by the white public. However, on the other hand it was a black artist painting these elements and in a way could be seen as reclaiming the black identity.  How Motley contributed to Chicago Black Renaissance  The Harlem Renaissance is recognized as the movement that originally popularized black art and gave black artists a name. Along with the surge of artists in Harlem, the same phenomenon happened in Chicago without the same popularity. This development of art in Chicago came from similar events similar to what happened in Harlem, “the inflow of black southerners into Chicago; the creation of the WPA’s Federal Art Project (FAP) administered by the Illinois Art Project (IAP); the founding of the South Side Community Art Center (SSCAC); and the artistic production and promotion of Chicago black arts scene by predominant artists.” One of these artists being Archibald Motley. After thousands of people moved into the areas, communities were built. In these communities, young artists were using the path built by the older generation of artists. Since the younger artists in the city were using artists like Motley, William Scott, and Charles Dawson as inspiration and as role models, the older generation’s work never died. Motley and other’s art became trans-generational. Chicago was a mecca. There was a period of regrowth, which came from the city wide fire in 1871. The fire gave the city a chance to rebuild, both structurally and culturally. Old vacant buildings were being used as studios for artists and musicians. The creation of Hull House was significant to Chicago’s artistic history because it gave a space for “immigrants and other working-class Chicagoans.” Although Hull House was meant to be a space used for the marginalized, African Americans were still excluded. It was not by definition segregated, but the belief that having blacks in the studio would deter future members from joining was held among many of the organization’s board members. Due to this exclusion, the homes of elite black families became galleries and this gave black Chicagoans a space finally show what they had been creating. Following these in-home galleries, the need for an institution where African American artists could be taught formally was met. The School of the Art Institute of Chicago was one of the few schools that allowed black attendance. This acceptance drew in even more black artists into the city and educated well known black artists, like Motley. Having the Institute in Chicago helped grow the artistic community by drawing artists in and keeping them in the city.

A member institution of the Florida College System, it has campuses in Cocoa, Melbourne, Palm Bay, and Titusville, as well as an Aerospace program at Kennedy Space Center and a Virtual Campus. EFSC is a direct connect satellite campus program to The University of Central Florida (UCF) in Orlando, Florida. Since its inception, the college has served more than a half-million students. About 35,000 students take courses annually on the Titusville, Cocoa, Melbourne and Palm Bay campuses, and online. According to state Florida College System statistics, the college has among the top graduation rates in the 28-member Florida College System, and the highest graduation rate among state and community colleges in Central Florida. In 2010, the college reported 25,000 students enrolled for courses. There were 1,200 employees in 2011, including support personnel and faculty. History In the fall of 1960, the Brevard County School Board founded Brevard Junior College with 768 students in the former Cocoa High School (built in 1925) on Forrest Avenue in Cocoa. Dr. J. Bruce Wilson was president. There were 31 faculty members. Four associate degrees were offered. The School Colors were Red-White-Blue and the School Mascot was a \\"Spartan\\". At the time, it was racially segregated, and a separate Carver Junior College for African-American students was opened the same year. To accomplish desegregation in compliance with the law, Brevard Junior College merged with the all-black Carver Junior College in 1963 and moved to the present location of the Cocoa Campus at 1519 Clearlake Rd in Cocoa. The college was renamed Brevard Community College in 1970 when the state of Florida created a system of two-year colleges. The college would then offer aeronautics specialities as it would be a foundation school for many NASA-tied universities such as Florida Institute of Technology and University of Central Florida. In 1966, the enrollment reached 4,335. The college experienced a 51% increase in enrollment for online classes from 2007 to 2010. In September 2012, a professor was placed on paid leave, and an investigation was started, after the professor allegedly made students sign a pledge to vote for Barack Obama. An investigation concluded that the professor violated policies and should be fired. On July 1, 2013, it was officially named Eastern Florida State College. It now offers four year degrees in health care management and general business management.USAtoday, Aug22,2013, page 5A \\"Community colleges graduate to 4 ears\\" Academics Melbourne Campus The college offers nearly 100 degree and certificate programs, including career and technical programs.

Overview The purpose of PolarTREC is to stimulate polar science education and awareness. Expeditions Notable past PolarTREC expeditions include: •Carbon Balance in Warming and Drying Tundra (2013), which studied the effects of warming and drying on tundra carbon balance •Airborne Survey of Polar Ice (2013), a six- year NASA mission, which is the largest airborne survey of Earth's polar ice ever conducted •Tectonic History of the Transantartic Mountains (2012), which deciphered the tectonic history of the Transantarctic Mountains and the Wilkes Subglacial Basin •Greenland Education Tour (2012), part of an initiative to foster enhanced international scientific cooperation between Greenland and the US •In 2011, PolarTREC teacher John Wood lived in a tent at the top of Mt. Erebus, an active volcano in Antarctica. The average temperative was -20 F. Teacher Experience Teachers must apply to the program and only the top 100 applications make it to the PolarTREC selection committee. Researcher also must apply and be selected as a PolarTREC research team. After researchers are selected, a selection of the top 30-40 teacher applications are sent to the various research teams. Researchers select which of the teachers to interview, after which they invite a teacher to join the team. There are usually 12 research teams—6 in the Arctic and 6 in the Antarctic—so out of the over 200 applicants each year only 12 get chosen. Once accepted PolarTREC covers the costs of the expedition. The teachers are given special training through webinars and a week long orientation in Fairbanks, Alaska. While on the trip teachers are expected to communicate through the Virtual Home Base and give updates using message boards, photo albums, podcasts, \\"PolarConnect\\" events and presentations from the field.http://www.polartrec.com/teachers/faq Using the message boards and journals, teachers can document what the students get excited about and how they learn.

She acquired recognition in the literary world for translating the works of the Chilean nobel laureate Pablo Neruda into the Greek language. Early life Danai was born in Athens but grew up in Paris and Marseilles, France where she studied political science, orthophony and phonetics, whilst she developed her career as a singer. In the early years of her career as a musician she collaborated with a number of Greek musicians. In 1935 she interprets the songs of the modern music composer Attik (Kleon Triandafylou) and subsequently recorded and popularised many of his songs. Throughout her career as a musician, she devoted herself to interpreting Greek folk and popular songs. She earned awards and decorations for her singing and compositions at national and international music festivals and during the Second World War she fought in the anti-Nazi and anti-fascist resistance. Residence in Chile In Chile, Stratigopoulou held an academic post at the University of Santiago de Chile as an educator in Greek folklore and phonetics. It was during her residence in Chile that she composed much of her musical work (which totaled about 300 songs), and published a number of literary works and poetry. Stratigopoulou formed a personal friendship with the Chilean poet and Nobel laureate Pablo Neruda and would spend time at Neruda's residence in Isla Negra where she read and discussed poetry. Her vast knowledge of Neruda's work and literature and language led her to become an important translator of Pablo Neruda's Spanish poetry into Greek. For all her cultural work in Chile, she was decorated by the Chilean Republic.

Context The station was built by the Midland Railway on the circuitous Barrow Hill to Pleasley West line known as the Doe Lea Branch, because it ran for much of its length along the valley of the River Doe Lea. History The line was opened without ceremony on 1 September 1890, but no station was built at Glapwell.The service in 1890, no Glapwell Old Miner Pressure from the residents of Bramley Vale led to one being built and opened on 1 September 1892 as \\"Glapwell\\". It initially provided a service of three trains each way between Mansfield and Chesterfield, taking about an hour from end to end. The line was single track between Seymour Junction and Pleasley West. Accordingly, the station had a single platform and a typical MR country station building, very similar to Clowne and Barlborough and Bolsover Castle. Normal passenger traffic along the Doe Lea Branch dwindled over the years and finally ceased on 28 July 1930. Glapwell Colliery was still going strong at this time. As its sidings left the passenger line to the North of the station and all coal went out northwards, the station was abandoned along with the track southwards through Rowthorn Tunnel to Pleasley Colliery West Junction a short distance South of Pleasley West. The station building was not destroyed and by the early 1970s was used by an evangelical Christian group. The last steam train to use the line was an enthusiasts' special on 16 October 1965. This train also traversed the Clowne Branch. When Glapwell Colliery closed in 1974 the line South of Bolsover Castle station became redundant, though it was not lifted until 1978. The trackbed south from Bolsover Castle almost to Glapwell at the bottom of Rylah Hill between Palterton and M1 J29 is now a public bridleway known as The Stockley Trail.Stockley Trail: via Derbyshire County Council References Sources  Further reading * * External links *Glapwell station on old O.S.

Spalford was a township in the parish of North Clifton, it became a separate parish in 1866. According to the 2001 census it had a population of 85. To the west of the parish is the River Trent, and to the south is the Local nature reserve and Site of Special Scientific Interest known as Spalford Warren. The reserve habitat being made up of blown sand heathland, which is rare in Nottinghamshire. Spalford Floodbank In 1795 during the largest known flood on the Trent, the floodbank which is situated between Spalford and the river was breached. Floodwaters from the breach spread out across the low lying land, even reaching the River Witham and flooding Lincoln. Some 20,000 acres were flooded for a period of over three weeks. A description of the breach was given as follows: “The bank is formed upon a plain of sandy nature, and when it was broken in 1795, the water forced an immense breach, the size of which may be judged from the fact that eighty loads of faggots and upwards of four hundred tons of earth were required to fill up the hole, an operation which took several weeks to complete.” The flood bank was subsequently strengthened and repaired, following further Trent floods in 1824 and 1852.

There are the important relations between connections on fiber bundles Y\\\\to X, Y\\\\to \\\\Sigma and \\\\Sigma\\\\to X. Composite bundle In differential geometry by a composite bundle is meant the composition : \\\\pi: Y\\\\to \\\\Sigma\\\\to X \\\\qquad\\\\qquad (1) of fiber bundles : \\\\pi_{Y\\\\Sigma}: Y\\\\to\\\\Sigma, \\\\qquad \\\\pi_{\\\\Sigma X}: \\\\Sigma\\\\to X. It is provided with bundle coordinates (x^\\\\lambda,\\\\sigma^m,y^i) , where (x^\\\\lambda,\\\\sigma^m) are bundle coordinates on a fiber bundle \\\\Sigma\\\\to X, i.e., transition functions of coordinates \\\\sigma^m are independent of coordinates y^i. The following fact provides the above mentioned physical applications of composite bundles. Given the composite bundle (1), let h be a global section of a fiber bundle \\\\Sigma\\\\to X, if any. Then the pullback bundle Y^h=h^*Y over X is a subbundle of a fiber bundle Y\\\\to X. Composite principal bundle  For instance, let P\\\\to X be a principal bundle with a structure Lie group G which is reducible to its closed subgroup H. There is a composite bundle P\\\\to P/H\\\\to X where P\\\\to P/H is a principal bundle with a structure group H and P/H\\\\to X is a fiber bundle associated with P\\\\to X. Given a global section h of P/H\\\\to X, the pullback bundle h^*P is a reduced principal subbundle of P with a structure group H. In gauge theory, sections of P/H\\\\to X are treated as classical Higgs fields.  Jet manifolds of a composite bundle Given the composite bundle Y\\\\to \\\\Sigma\\\\to X (1), consider the jet manifolds J^1\\\\Sigma, J^1_\\\\Sigma Y, and J^1Y of the fiber bundles \\\\Sigma\\\\to X, Y\\\\to \\\\Sigma, and Y\\\\to X, respectively. They are provided with the adapted coordinates ( x^\\\\lambda,\\\\sigma^m, \\\\sigma^m_\\\\lambda) , (x^\\\\lambda, \\\\sigma^m, y^i, \\\\widehat y^i_\\\\lambda, y^i_m), , and (x^\\\\lambda, \\\\sigma^m, y^i, \\\\sigma^m_\\\\lambda ,y^i_\\\\lambda). There is the canonical map : J^1\\\\Sigma\\\\times_\\\\Sigma J^1_\\\\Sigma Y\\\\to_Y J^1Y, \\\\qquad y^i_\\\\lambda=y^i_m \\\\sigma^m_\\\\lambda +\\\\widehat y^i_\\\\lambda. Composite connection This canonical map defines the relations between connections on fiber bundles Y\\\\to X, Y\\\\to\\\\Sigma and \\\\Sigma\\\\to X. These connections are given by the corresponding tangent-valued connection forms : \\\\gamma=dx^\\\\lambda\\\\otimes (\\\\partial_\\\\lambda +\\\\gamma_\\\\lambda^m\\\\partial_m + \\\\gamma_\\\\lambda^i\\\\partial_i), : A_\\\\Sigma=dx^\\\\lambda\\\\otimes (\\\\partial_\\\\lambda + A_\\\\lambda^i\\\\partial_i) +d\\\\sigma^m\\\\otimes (\\\\partial_m + A_m^i\\\\partial_i), : \\\\Gamma=dx^\\\\lambda\\\\otimes (\\\\partial_\\\\lambda + \\\\Gamma_\\\\lambda^m\\\\partial_m). A connection A_\\\\Sigma on a fiber bundle Y\\\\to\\\\Sigma and a connection \\\\Gamma on a fiber bundle \\\\Sigma\\\\to X define a connection : \\\\gamma=dx^\\\\lambda\\\\otimes (\\\\partial_\\\\lambda +\\\\Gamma_\\\\lambda^m\\\\partial_m + (A_\\\\lambda^i + A_m^i\\\\Gamma_\\\\lambda^m)\\\\partial_i) on a composite bundle Y\\\\to X. It is called the composite connection. This is a unique connection such that the horizontal lift \\\\gamma\\\\tau onto Y of a vector field \\\\tau on X by means of the composite connection \\\\gamma coincides with the composition A_\\\\Sigma(\\\\Gamma\\\\tau) of horizontal lifts of \\\\tau onto \\\\Sigma by means of a connection \\\\Gamma and then onto Y by means of a connection A_\\\\Sigma. Vertical covariant differential Given the composite bundle Y (1), there is the following exact sequence of vector bundles over Y: : 0\\\\to V_\\\\Sigma Y\\\\to VY\\\\to Y\\\\times_\\\\Sigma V\\\\Sigma\\\\to 0, \\\\qquad\\\\qquad (2) where V_\\\\Sigma Y and V_\\\\Sigma^*Y are the vertical tangent bundle and the vertical cotangent bundle of Y\\\\to\\\\Sigma. Every connection A_\\\\Sigma on a fiber bundle Y\\\\to\\\\Sigma yields the splitting : A_\\\\Sigma: TY\\\\supset VY i \\\\dot y^i\\\\partial_i + \\\\dot\\\\sigma^m\\\\partial_m \\\\to (\\\\dot y^i -A^i_m\\\\dot\\\\sigma^m)\\\\partial_i of the exact sequence (2). Using this splitting, one can construct a first order differential operator : \\\\widetilde D: J^1Y\\\\to T^*X\\\\otimes_Y V_\\\\Sigma Y, \\\\qquad \\\\widetilde D= dx^\\\\lambda\\\\otimes(y^i_\\\\lambda- A^i_\\\\lambda -A^i_m\\\\sigma^m_\\\\lambda)\\\\partial_i, on a composite bundle Y\\\\to X. It is called the vertical covariant differential. It possesses the following important property. Let h be a section of a fiber bundle \\\\Sigma\\\\to X, and let h^*Y\\\\subset Y be the pullback bundle over X. Every connection A_\\\\Sigma induces the pullback connection : A_h=dx^\\\\lambda\\\\otimes[\\\\partial_\\\\lambda+((A^i_m\\\\circ h)\\\\partial_\\\\lambda h^m +(A\\\\circ h)^i_\\\\lambda)\\\\partial_i] on h^*Y. Then the restriction of a vertical covariant differential \\\\widetilde D to J^1h^*Y\\\\subset J^1Y coincides with the familiar covariant differential D^{A_h} on h^*Y relative to the pullback connection A_h.

The story is set in a world where humanity lives in cities surrounded by enormous walls; a defense against the Titans, gigantic humanoids that eat humans seemingly without reason. The story initially centers on Eren Yeager with his childhood friends Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert, who join the military to fight the Titans after their home town is invaded and Eren's mother is eaten. They are part of the 104th Training Corps, whose graduates assume different positions in the Military, including the Garrison Regiment, the Survey Corps and the Military Police Brigade. It is later revealed that the area where the Walls are located is called and that it is the last territory of . There are other empires outside the walls, namely , which has infiltrated Paradis with its Titan Shifters. For some reason a character named Levi Ackerman, has millions of fangirls. Main characters ; : The main protagonist of the series who, after witnessing his mother being devoured by a Titan, dedicates his life to their eradication and his best friend Armin, Armin is also one of the many main characters but has not been mentioned in this article. After graduating fifth in his cadet class, he is swallowed by a bearded Titan during his first mission in Trost. However, he soon reappears as a Titan who fights other Titans on equal ground. His ability as a Titan makes him the target of multiple parties that include those who see him as a tool to eradicate the Titans, other humans who can become Titans, and those who perceive Eren as a rebellion-inducing threat to the status quo. Placed into the Survey Corps' Special Operations Squad, he attempts to control his Titan-changing ability and discovers he has other abilities as well. In the final arc, Eren believes that obliterating the nations outside the island is the only solution for the survival of Paradis and its people.

A normally quiet and withdrawn girl, she maintains a stoic expression except when it comes to Eren and her friends. As later revealed, Mikasa's father was a descendant of an Eldian bloodline that was modified to create super soldiers equal to a Titan in strength. When under duress, these genetically inherited abilities may allow a descendant access to their ancestors' battle experience. After Eren and his father discover The Ackermans' deaths during a routine doctor's visit, Eren tracks Mikasa to the trader's cabin. Mikasa's instincts are awakened when Eren urges her to 'fight back and live'. Because of this, and because of Eren's kindness in giving her a dark red scarf which Mikasa treasures and wears her entire life, she feels compelled to protect and follow him at all costs, including joining him in the Survey Corps. She graduates from the Training Corps top of her class, and is regarded by officers as an unprecedented genius and prodigy, easily worth a hundred men in battle. Though technically half-blooded, she is the last known person of Oriental descent residing in the Walls. A wrist tattoo inherited from her mother (which she keeps hidden from everyone except Eren) indicates that she is descended from the prominent , a cadet Shogun branch from the Oriental nation of , whose ancestors migrated from their native land to Paradis as honored ambassadors. While investigating the Volunteers alongside the Survey Corps, Eren tells Mikasa that he has always hated her for being a slave to her Ackerman blood. In turn, she becomes despondent and removes the dark red scarf off her neck. While still invested in Eren, Mikasa decides to join the alliance to stop Eren's planned genocide. In the author's blog, Isayama notes that her name comes from the Mikasa, a famous pre-dreadnought battleship of the Imperial Japanese Navy. : Mikasa is voiced by Yui Ishikawa in Japanese, and Trina Nishimura in English dub. In the live-action film, she is portrayed by Kiko Mizuhara. Ishikawa says that Mikasa cares mainly about Eren, and keeps a distance from the rest of the world. She says that \\"While she might seem like a character with so few emotional levels, there are actually many feelings that swirl around her heart.\\" ; : Armin is Eren's childhood friend who joins him in the Scouts to order to make a meaningful difference in the world, and to fulfill his dream of seeing the outside world. When Armin was young, his parents tried to venture beyond the Wall by creating a hot air balloon but were found out and killed by the First Interior Squad, leaving Armin to be raised by his grandfather. Armin's grandfather secretly possessed an illegal book containing information about the world beyond the Walls, which Armin later found and read. Fascinated by descriptions of gigantic body of saltwater, fire water, land made of ice, and fields of sand, Armin showed it to his best friend Eren, kindling his desire to see the outside world. After the fall of Wall Maria, Armin's grandfather was sent along with 1/5 of the population (mostly Wall Maria refugees) on a high-risk operation to \\"reclaim Wall Maria\\" and died as a result, leaving Armin an orphan and the only survivor of his family. The expedition was, in reality, a scheme contrived by the Royal Government to cull the number of refugees and alleviate food shortages. : After joining the Training Corps with Eren and Mikasa, Armin initially has an inferiority complex, seeing how he falls short of his companions in combat and endurance. He often laments over his perceived cowardliness and dependence on his friends. However, he excels in academics, and his confidence slowly grows when he realizes he can use his brain and strategic abilities to help his friends. Despite his self-perceived shortcomings, he vigorously defends Eren when the military threatened them with cannon fire after it was revealed Eren was a Titan, and he brings Eren out of his feral Titan state following the latter's second full transformation where he attacks Mikasa. Armin also impresses his superiors by correctly deducing the human identity of the Female Titan and convinces Eren to overcome his hesitation to fight her during their confrontation in Stohess District inside Wall Sina. Later chapters describe him as being intelligent, a talented tactician, a deep thinker with good judgement, level-headedness, and ability to think outside the box. During a battle in Shinganshina, Armin comes up with a plan to capture Bertolt but is mortally wounded from the severe burns he sustained. Levi saves Armin by injecting him with Titan serum, and Armin then acquires the Colossus Titan's power by eating Bertolt. After investigating the Volunteers to learn Zeke and Eren's intentions, he is imprisoned in Shiganshina district by the Yeagerists. During the Marleyan ambush, he battles Pieck, before becoming horrified upon learning Eren's intentions to utilize the full rumbling. He later joins the alliance to stop Eren Yeager from destroying all life outside Paradis. : Armin is voiced by Marina Inoue in Japanese, and Josh Grelle in the English dub. In the live-action feature film, Kanata Hongō plays Armin. Inoue describes Armin as \\"withdrawn but slowly grows to the point where he's able to say what he believes\\". ; : Reiner is a member of the Marleyan military's Warrior Unit and is the holder of the . As the leader of the infiltration unit responsible for Marley's opening offensive against the Walls, he serves as the main antagonist for the manga's first eight volumes (i.e. the anime's first season). Reiner is introduced as a cadet of the 104th Training Corps who graduates 2nd in his class. Described by instructor Keith Shadis as being strong as an ox and a natural leader, he quickly earns the trust of the Survey Corps and infiltrates their ranks. : As a child, Reiner joined Marley's Warrior Unit so he and his Eldian mother could become honorary Marleyans and be reunited with his Marleyan father. Despite being rejected by his birth father, the fanatical patriotism instilled in him by his mother drives him to move forward with his mission to capture the Founding Titan (aka: the \\"Coordinate\\") from Paradis Island. When the group leader, Marcel, is unexpectedly eaten during their journey, Reiner assumes command over the remaining two Warriors, Annie and Bertholt. They flood Shiganshina with rampaging, 'Pure Titans' by destroying the outer gate of the District before breaking through the gate at Wall Maria. They then disguise themselves as refugees and join the masses of people into Wall Rose before joining the military. Unable to pinpoint the Coordinate's location, Reiner orchestrates an attack on Wall Rose to root out its holder. Upon witnessing Eren transform into a titan during the ensuing battle of Trost, Reiner suspects him of possessing the Coordinate and tasks Annie with his capture. However, the plan ultimately ends in failure and Annie is taken captive. As Marley launches another offensive against Paradis, Reiner begs Eren to leave with him and Bertholt to prevent further bloodshed, after revealing themselves as the Armored and Colossal Titans. When Eren refuses, Reiner and Berthold transform and attempt to extract him by force, managing to take him halfway through Wall Maria in the process. However, they are thwarted by the rest of the Survey Corps and are forced to retreat, taking with them fellow corps member Ymir instead. Reiner and Berthold regroup with Zeke Yeager, holder of the Beast Titan, and his forces consisting of Pure Titans. In the Battle of Shiganshina, Reiner is defeated and mutilated by the Survey Corps' newly developed 'Thunder Spear' before Zeke and his allies are able to rush him to safety. In the Year 854, Reiner becomes disillusioned with Marley, and after learning he has to go back to Paradis, attempts suicide, but changes his mind after realizing he still has to care for the Warrior Candidates. Reiner battles Eren when the latter attacks Marley and stops him from killing Galliard. He later plans a surprise ambush on Paradis with the goal of eating Eren, but fails, and is driven to complete despair when Eren begins the rumbling. He is then invited by Connie and Gabi to join the alliance aiming to stop Eren from destroying all life outside Paradis. : In a post on his blog, author Hajime Isayama stated that the Armored Titan's physique was based on that of professional wrestler and mixed martial artist Brock Lesnar. In 2017, Isayama announced in an interview with Illustration Magazine that Reiner was now a \\"main protagonist\\" character.http://comicbook.com/anime/2017/07/31/attack-on-titan-new- protagonist-reiner/ Reiner is voiced by Yoshimasa Hosoya in the Japanese anime. Robert McCollum provides his voice in the English version.  Paradis  is a massive island on which the three Walls are located. It became the last territory of the Empire of after the Great Titan War and hosts refugees mainly consisting of ethnic Eldians. The island is modeled after Madagascar. The military within the Walls is divided into three divisions: the Garrison Regiment, the Survey Corps, and the Military Police Brigade. It is commanded by Darius Zachary, the premier of the government. Applicants into the Military are first required to enter the Training Corps, after which they are allowed to join one of the three divisions. ; : Darius is the commander-in-chief of the military and a premier. He first appears at Eren's tribunal where he assigns Eren to the custody of the Survey Corps after his identity as a Titan is revealed. After it was shown that the ruling nobles would abandon the people of Wall Rose should it be breached by Titans following a bold ploy by the Survey Corps, he pledges to support Erwin's plan to overthrow the monarchy and the true leading family, the Reiss family. Subsequently, the First Interior Squad in the castle was restrained. In the Japanese anime, he is voiced by Hideaki Tezuka. In the Funimation version, his name is spelled Dhalis Zachary and he is voiced by John Swasey. 104th Training Corps The is the branch of the military dedicated to training and educating new recruits to become members of the three military branches. Only the top ten graduates are permitted the privilege of applying to the Military Police Brigade and living within the Inner District. The other graduates can only choose between joining the Survey Corps or the Garrison Regiment. The Training Crops' insignia is a crossing pair of swords. The is the only graduating class introduced in the series and the southern division contains nearly all of the central characters. It was active during the years 847 through 850 when the remaining recruits graduated. In the manga, the top ten cadets were listed by their individual ranks but in the anime, the top ten are recognized as a group, along with Armin and Ymir. ; : The instructor who is in charge of training the 104th Corps recruits. His face and head are cleanly shaven except for a patch of beard beneath his chin. Before the fall of Wall Maria in the year 845, he became the 12th Commander of the Survey Corps and struggled to establish a base beyond the Walls, with no success. Following a particularly taxing expedition he suffered a mental breakdown and resigned his post to his successor, Erwin Smith, becoming the first commander to pass on his position without dying. He was close friends with Eren's parents; especially his mother, Carla, who he secretly loved. He was also the one to discover Eren deep in the forest after the Fall of Shiganshina, immediately following the moment when Eren's father passed on his Titan abilities to his son, and brought him back to safety. : In the Japanese anime, he is voiced by Tsuguo Mogami. In the Funimation English dub, his surname is spelled Sadies, but pronounced \\"Shardis\\". Patrick Seitz provides the voice. ; : A hot-headed young man who speaks his mind, he initially planned to join the Military Police in order to live safely within Wall Sina and manages to graduate within the top ten of his class, ranking sixth. He and Eren have opposing ideals; Jean thinks Eren is suicidal for wanting to be on the front line while Eren views Jean as cowardly for wanting a cushy life in the Inner District. In the battle of Trost, he leads a group of recruits to the safety of the supply house but is shaken that his decision led to the deaths of some of his comrades. After his close friend Marco dies he joins the Survey Corps. Jean later rises to become a commanding officer in the Survey Corps, and leads ground operations during the Raid on Liberio. Jean later intensely struggles with whether or not to stop the Rumbling, but chooses to abandon his dream for the sake of saving the world, as he doesn't want his fallen comrades, particularly Marco, to be disappointed in him. Isayama said that Jean is his favorite character because he says what he thinks. Jean also harbors jealousy toward Eren because of Mikasa's apparent infatuation with him; it is heavily implied that Jean has a crush on Mikasa. : Jean is voiced by Kishō Taniyama in the Japanese anime. In the Funimation English version, his last name is spelled Kirschtein and he is voiced by Mike McFarland. In the live-action film, he is portrayed by Takahiro Miura. ; : Ranked seventh of the trainee class, Marco is from the Jinae District and becomes close friends with Armin and Jean. He aspires to join the Military Police so he can serve King Fritz, only to end up being killed under mysterious circumstances near the end of the battle of Trost. It is later revealed that he inadvertently overheard Berthold and Reiner talking about their Marleyan mission. Reiner tackles him and gives his vertical gear to Annie before leaving him to be consumed partly by a titan. Annie later uses his gear to cover up her killing of the captive Pure Titans, Sawney and Bean. : Marco is voiced by Ryōta Ōsaka in Japanese. In the English dub, his name is spelled Marco Bodt and he is voiced by Austin Tindle. ; : Connie hails from the Ragako District of Wall Rose. He sports a buzz cut and has an outgoing and upbeat personality, always trying his best to keep his teammates pumped up and not shying away from encounters with Titans. His training instructor describes him as having a good sense of balance and performs well with the vertical maneuvering equipment, but that he also has a slow mind and makes strategic mistakes. Having ranked eighth in his class, he initially plans to join the Military Police but changes his mind after hearing Eren's speech, and eventually joins the Survey Corps. Later, his village is decimated by the Beast Titan and all of its inhabitants are turned into Pure Titans. : Connie is voiced by Hiro Shimono in the Japanese dub of the anime. In the Funimation dub, his name is spelled Conny Springer and he is voiced by Clifford Chapin. ; : Sasha is a hunter from the mountainous Dauper District. She is tall and lean, and her auburn hair is styled in a ponytail. She is noted as a proficient hunter skilled with a bow and has remarkable hearing and instincts, but she also has issues with structure and authority. She seems obsessed with food and was nicknamed for eating one during a military training drill. She joins the military after getting into an argument with her father when he tells her they must give up their traditional hunting lifestyle in the forest in favor of farming to support the large number of refugees moving to the area after the fall of Wall Maria. She manages to become a member of Captain Levi's Elite Squad with a number of her fellow 104th compatriots. While withdrawing from Liberio during her group's attack on Marley to acquire both the Warhammer Titan's power and Zeke, Sasha is fatally wounded when shot in the chest by a stowaway Gabi and utters \\"Meat\\" with her dying breath. She is later revealed to have formed a close friendship, implied to be a romantic, with a Marleyan prisoner of war turned chef named Nicolo. : In the Japanese anime, Sasha is voiced by Yū Kobayashi. In the Funimation English version, her last name is spelled Braus and she is voiced by Ashly Burch. In the live-action film, she is portrayed by Nanami Sakuraba. ; : A petite girl who is described as friendly, warm-hearted, and popular to the point where her peers regard her as a goddess or an angel. Even Reiner falls for her and decides that he wants to marry her. . Her true identity is , the illegitimate child of Rod Reiss, the true King of Elida. She lived on a farm owned by the Reiss family during which time she only had minimal interaction with her mother who spent much of her days reading quietly. Once, in an attempt to connect with her mother, Krista rushed to hug her but was violently pushed back and heard her mother say that she wished she had the courage to kill Krista. Those were the first words Krista heard her mother say. After that, Krista was sent to live with her grandparents but when Wall Maria fell Krista was collected by and introduced to her father, Rod Reiss. Before she could leave, however, Reiss' elite squad led by Kenny Ackermann persuaded him to tie up loose ends and kill Krista and her mother. Before her throat was slashed, Krista's mother said she wished she'd never been born. Before Krista is killed, Rod Reiss orders that she be spared and tells her to assume the name Krista Lentz and to live with the Wall Maria refugees. Krista later joins the 104th Training Corps, presumably as self punishment and as a way to kill herself (secretly loathing her true identity), where she ranked tenth in her class,. She later participated in the defense of Trost in the year 850. When Ymir reveals herself as a Titan to save her at Castle Utgard, Krista honors the promise they made prior by revealing and accepting her true identity as heir to the Royal Family. Later, she and Eren are abducted by Rod Reiss and brought to his cavern where Titan inheritance ceremonies took place. As his only living heir, Reiss attempts to convince Historia to become a Titan and consume Eren to regain the Coordinate power of the Founding Titan. However, having learned of the Founding Titan's curse of complacence in the face of adversity, Hisotria refuses. She rescues Eren and helps the Survey Corps take down her father after he transforms into a massive Titan, making the killing blow and securing her identity as the true ruler of Eldia. Historia agrees to the Survey Corps wishes to assume the throne and uses her status as Queen to relinquish most of her ruling duties to the Military while using the money confiscated from disowned nobles to improve the lives of orphans and the homeless. Historia later accept Hizuru's conditions to secure Paradis's safe 50-year long progression into the world stage by agreeing to succeed Zeke Yeager as the Beast Titan and to birth several heirs who would continue protecting Paradis in her stead. : Krista is voiced by Shiori Mikami in the Japanese anime. In the Funimation English version, her name is spelled Christa Lenz and she is voiced by Bryn Apprill. ; : A member of the 104th graduating class and a close friend of Krista. She remains distant from her other classmates and is both harsh and critical, maintaining an air of indifference. It is strongly hinted at that she held back her abilities during training so that Krista could place tenth in the training corps standings. When titans attack Castle Utgard, Ymir transforms into a chimpanzee-like Titan that, despite its smaller size, is nimble enough to take down several large titans with its speed, claws, and teeth. : Prior to the events in the series, Ymir was a nameless Eldian orphan living in Marley who was picked by a cult leader to pose as a royal descendant and religious figurehead. She was given the name after Ymir, after Ymir Fritz, and lived a peaceful life in comfort, worshiped by members of the cult. When Marleyan security forces later cracked down on the cult, she was scapegoated and sentenced to exile on Paradis as a Pure Titan. Ymir remained a mindless Titan for sixty years (an experience she later described as an \\"endless nightmare\\") until one day she chanced upon four teenage Marleyan Warrior infiltrators and devoured one named Marcel Galliard, who happened to possess the Jaw Titan. Consuming a Titan Shifter allowed her to return to her human form, and she decided to live this second life honest only to herself. She later joined the Training Corps and became close with Krista Lenz (Historia Reiss) of whom she is extremely protective. Having overheard church officials talking about Krista's true identity prior to joining the military, Ymir feels connected to her based on their shared past of bearing false names. She openly scolds Krista for living a 'false identiy' and tells her the only way to enact revenge on those who hurt her is to live her true life with pride. : When she and Eren are later captured by Reiner and Bertolt, Marcel's friends who bore witness to his death, Ymir expected that she would be killed for stealing the Titan power of their friend and expresses guilt over it. She willingly submits to being taken back to Marley on the condition that she can 'rescue' and take Krista with them. However, during the rescue operation to recover Eren, Ymir has a change of heart when Krista tells her that she will live only for herself and feels no fear when Ymir is at her side. No longer wanting to hand Krista over to Marley, Ymir instead leaves her behind and rescues Berthold and Reiner from a horde of titans before they escape; she feels indebted to them since coming upon their group was the reason she became human again, even though returning to Marley with them will no doubt end her life. Some time after Krista becomes queen, Ymir sends a letter to her where she states her impending death, likely by another Warrior who will transform into a Titan and eat her to obtain the power she stole. This is later confirmed by Porco Galliard, who reclaimed his brother Marcel's power of the Jaw Titan. : Ymir is voiced by Saki Fujita in the Japanese version and by Elizabeth Maxwell in the English version. ; : A former 104th Training Corps cadet of the Southern Division and a fellow recruit of Eren's group who joined the Garrison Regiment after graduation (like most of the 104th cadets did). After the Survey Corps' uprising and Historia's coronation, he transferred to the Survey Corps as a new recruit where he questions Jean Kirstein during the feast on the eve of the expedition to Shiganshina District; he rhetorically asks whether Jean thinks the Garrison recruits are reliable since increased propaganda for the Scouts has painted them in a much different, and more positive, light. During the operation to recapture Wall Maria, he was assigned to Squad Klaus along with his two friends Gordon and Sandra. He was the only known survivor in Erwin's suicide charge against the Beast Titan, and was the person who carried the mortally wounded commander back to Shiganshina to regroup with other survivors of the battle. After Erwin eventually succumbed to his injuries, he became one of the only nine survivors of the whole operation (the other eight being Squad Levi and Hange Zoe), and was personally decorated by Queen Historia. However, after learning the truth about the basement in Eren's home, he adopted a more vindictive and hateful attitude towards the people outside the wall (as shown by his total disregard for collateral damage during the Battle of Liberio four years later). He becomes a zealous supporter of Eren who he believes is the Eldian nation's only savior, and leads a faction called the Yeagerists which overthrows the previous government. After Eren's message to all of subjects of Ymir Floch declares that the Yeagerists seized the power over Paradis. When Floch learns about plans of an alliance of 104th Training Corps and Warriors to stop the Rumbling he takes Kiyomi Azumabito hostage in the harbour of Paradis, but stumbles on the alliance' resistance. When the alliance successfully drives away the Marleyan warship with the Azumabito's plane from the harbour, Floch silently sneaks to the plane (or to the ship) and shortly after it shoots the plane's covering before getting killed by Mikasa. : Floch is voiced by Kenshō Ono in the Japanese version and by Matt Shipman in the English version. Survey Corps The is composed of expeditionary soldiers that venture outside the Walls. Their goal is to discover more about the origins and source of the Titans, their motives, and weaknesses; ultimately how to fight and defeat them. They are an integral component in the military's campaign to recapture Wall Maria. Due to this, the division suffers from a much larger casualty rate than the Military police or the Garrison Regiment; those that survive are some of the most elite veterans in the entire military. The Survey Corps' insignia is an overlapping pair of wings known as the \\"Wings of Freedom\\". ; : Commander of the Survey Corps, who led the last mission before the fall of Wall Maria, having served the government even after they murdered his father as a child believing it was for the good for the people to conceal the truth of Paradis' establishment. He also made the difficult choices for the benefit of others, which required him to sacrifice the lives of his men to see it through; he has a reputation for gambling everything on unorthodox battle strategies. A shrewd, charismatic leader who encourages creative thinking among his subordinates, Erwin developed with the Long-Range Scouting Formation, which substantially reduced the Survey Corps' death toll during its expeditions (Despite this, the Scouts continued to suffer significant casualties). After learning of a mole among the military ranks, Erwin concealed this intel from his most trusted subordination while orchestrating the 57th expedition to expose and capture Annie. When Eren is kidnapped by Bertolt and Reiner, he leads a team to rescue him, having his right arm eaten by a Titan in the occasion. Once learning the government's actions were only for the benefit of the upper class, Erwin stages a bloodless coup d'état to place Historia into power. Erwin then leads an expedition to Shinganshina to seal the breach on Wall Maria, where he and his forces face the Warrior Titans. Erwin ends up being mortally wounded after resolving to sacrifice himself and the remaining recruits so Levi can attempt to kill Beast Titan. Levi initially saw injecting Erwin with the Titan serum as the logical choice until realizing that Erwin continually demonized himself on their behalf, deciding to let Erwin die in peace from his injuries when giving Armin the injection. Ever since then, Levi has been on a hunt for the Beast titan Zeke to fulfill his promise to Erwin that he will hunt down and kill Zeke. He is voiced by Daisuke Ono in the Japanese anime, and by J. Michael Tatum in the English version. ; : Hange is a Survey Corps veteran and the leader of 4th Squad. A scientist who studies the Titans, Hange shows little fear when interacting with them, and is thus ecstatic when initially meeting Eren. Hange had a strong hatred against Titans until the discovery of Ilse Langnar's notebook provided some new insight into how the Titans may be able to this. Hange developed an obsessive interest in Titans, and gets uncomfortably intimate with them but that's because they love doing their job. Hange also invents new special weapons for the Scouts to use, such as a barrel that fires multiple grappling hooks to capture Titans alive, as well as the Thunder Spears which is instrumental to the later successful recapture of Wall Maria. In the aftermath of the battle of Shiganshina, Hange's left eye is lost because of shrapnel caused by Colossal Titan's transformation. Hange succeeds Erwin as commander of the Survey Corps. Following Eren's message to all Subjects of Ymir, Hange forms an alliance with the remaining members of the Survey Corps and the Warriors to stop Eren. Hange makes an ultimate self- sacrifice defending the members of the alliance from the Rumbling as they boarded the Azumabitos' flying boat, but before dying from burns and subsequent trampling Hange successfully eliminates four Colossal Titans. : In the original English translation of the manga, and in the anime, Hange is referred to as a female. However, in a blog post in 2011, Isayama responded to a question regarding Hange's gender, saying, \\"Perhaps [Hange's gender] is better left unstated\\". In 2014, Kodansha USA stated they went back through volume 5 and removed gender-specific pronouns they had used for reprint, and references from volume 6 onwards. Hange is voiced by Romi Park in the Japanese anime, by Jessica Calvello in the English dub, and is portrayed by Satomi Ishihara in the live-action film. ; : A Survey Corps squad leader who has a peculiar habit of snorting and sniffing people when he meets them for the first time. His strength is second to Levi among the Survey Corps squad leaders. When Wall Rose is breached by the Titans, Zacharius uses himself as a decoy to distract nine titans while his fellow soldiers escape. Zacharius manages to kill five of his opponents before he is incepted by the Beastly Titan. Zacharius is shocked to hear the titan speaking his language while being relieved of his gear, left to be devoured by the other three remaining Titans. He is voiced by Kenta Miyake in Japanese. In the Funimation English dub, his first name was spelled Miche and he is voiced by Jason Douglas. ; : Moblit Berner was a veteran member of the Survey Corps and the of the Survey Corps' 4th Squad, and served as assistant and messenger for Hange, whom he knows since she joining the Corps. An intelligent and responsible person, he is tasked to keep his overzealous and eccentric superior out of trouble, a job that leaves him in a state of near-panic much of the time having to constantly pull Hange to safety. He is killed at Shiganshina when Hange's entire squad are caught by the Colossal Titan's steam blast, but pushes Hange inside a well at the last moment to save her life. He is voiced by Rintarō Nishi in Japanese, and Jerry Jewell in English. ; : Resembling Ymir, Ilse was on the Survey Corps' 34th expedition with the task of taking detailed notes of her experiences outside the Walls. But she ended up encountering a trapped Abnormal Titan who mistook her for \\"Lady Ymir\\" and reached out to her in reverence. Ilse assumed the talking Titan can be beneficial for her work but she ends up having her head bitten off as a result of her unintentionally provoking the Titan enough for it to break free. Her story is recounted in the special chapter and an OVA titled . She is voiced by Sachi Kokuryu in Japanese. In the Funimation English dub of Attack on Titan: Junior High, she is voiced by Marissa Lenti. ; : Thomas is a member of the Survey Corps; he has dark hair and a goatee. He carries the news of the Titans breaching Wall Rose to Erwin and some of the citizens. ; : A member of the Survey Corps, Nanaba has short blond hair. She first appears during the 57th Expedition where she leads Krista's team in the forest used to ambush the Female Titan. She has some supporting roles in the Stohess storyline, and leads part of the squad when the Titans have breached Wall Rose. She is eaten by the Titans when the latter invade Castle Utgard. She is voiced by Asami Shimoda in the Japanese dub and by Lydia Mackay in the English dub.https://www.funimation.com/blog/2017/04/20/attack-on-titan- season-2-english-cast/ ; : Louise is a young girl from Trost and the daughter of a Garrison officer. She, along with her mother, are among the many citizens who are trapped inside the city when the Titans threatened to invaded Wall Rose, because the merchant Dimo Reeves was barring the gate with his cargo. Louise's mother assures her that her father will kill the Titans with cannons, but Louise spots an Abnormal Titan charging towards them. The Titan is swiftly slain by Mikasa Ackerman, who then proceeds to threatens Reeves to remove his wagon and clear the gate, allowing the citizens leave Trost. As Louise and her mother express their gratitude towards Mikasa, Mikasa salutes them and Louise, ecstatic, salutes back. : Louise later joins the Survey Corps at some point after the recapture of Wall Maria, inspired by Mikasa, whom she has come to idolize, and takes part in the Raid of Liberio in year 854. When Eren is arrested for acting against orders, Louise is among a handful of sympathizers who leak the information of Eren's arrest to the public in order to try to force the military to release him. After they are found out, Hange Zoë arrests Louise and her compatriots, and Louise is disappointed to learn she will not be staying in the same cell that Mikasa was imprisoned in. She is later freed by fellow sympathizers (called the \\"Yeagerists\\"), and meets with a jailbreaking Eren. She later passes away due to a shard of thunder spear lodged in her stomach. ; : Holger is a Survey Corps soldier before defecting to side with Eren Yeager and his group of rebels known as the Yeagerists. ; : Wim is a Survey Corps soldier before defecting to side with Eren Yeager and his group of rebels known as the Yeagerists. =Special Operations Squad= The , also known as , is a squad of four elite soldiers with impressive combat records hand-picked by Captain Levi. The squad takes Eren under their wing as both his bodyguards and potential executors if he goes berserk. All the original members of the squad, except for Levi and Eren, are killed by the Female Titan during the 57th expedition to Wall Maria. Later on, the squad is reformed with the six remaining recruits from the 104th Training Corps. ; : He is known as humanity's most powerful soldier and head of an elite squad in the Survey Corps. Hange remarks that he is a bit of a \\"clean freak\\".Attack on Titan manga, volume 3, \\"Side Story: Captain Levi\\": \\"Those kids and their envious looks...If only they know what a clean freak you are. It'd burst their bubble.\\" While it is said that he is blunt and unapproachable, it is noted that he has a strong respect for authority, structure and discipline. The side story Attack on Titan: No Regrets focuses on Levi's origins, revealing that he was part of a band of thieves using the Vertical Maneuvering Equipment to commit crimes before he is scouted by Erwin to join the army. Captain Kenny Ackerman later notes that the capture of Eren and Krista has to do with Levi, whom he refers to as \\"Levi Ackerman\\". Kenny is later revealed to be Levi's maternal uncle, who raised him after his mother Kuchel's death. Lately, in the Attack On Titan manga, Levi is said to be a victim of an explosion engineered by Zeke Yeager (brother of Eren Jaeger). He was in a near-death state until Hanji Zoe found him and escaped with his body later to make an alliance with Commander Theo Magath and Pieck Finger in order to take down Eren Jaeger. He was made to be the most powerful man on earth. He took Eren under his watch when he the people found out he could turn into a titan. Since then, he's been a fan favorite getting millions of fangirls that would do anything to protect him.

On the 57th expedition to the lands outside the wall, he is ambushed and killed during the retreat in the forest by Annie in her human form (using the vertical maneuvering equipment stolen from Marco). Gunther is voiced by Kozo Mito in the Japanese version and by Brett Weaver in the English version. Garrison Regiment The are the soldiers that protect the towns and reinforce the Walls. They are the first line of defense against the Titans, maintaining a defensive stance. They are the largest force in the military due to the small exclusive number of members in the Military Police Brigade and the high death rate of the Survey Corps. The Garrison Regiment's insignia is a pair of red roses. ; : A Garrison soldier who saves Eren and Mikasa during the attack on Shiganshina, While Eren finishes cadet training, Hannes becomes a Garrison squad leader. He seeks to repay a debt to the Yeager Family for saving his own wife and family from a deadly disease. Hannes assisted Mikasa and the other Survey Corps in rescuing Eren from Reiner and Bertolt. He would later die fighting the Titan that ate Eren's mother. Isayama said that Hannes and the Garrison Soldiers in volume 1 resemble him the most as they sit around and drink booze. He is voiced by Keiji Fujiwara (Season 1) and Kenjiro Tsuda (Season 2) in the Japanese version and by David Wald in the English version. ; : Dot Pixis is the highest-ranking commander of the Southern Territory. He is sometimes viewed as eccentric. Upon learning about the breach at Trost, he and his men stop Captain Woerman from shooting Eren after the latter is revealed to be able to transform into a Titan, He then mobilizes his soldiers in a mission to protect Eren during the latter's attempt to seal the wall. He appears later in the series to support Erwin's plan to overthrow the monarchy. In a 2010 post on his blog, Isayama stated he modeled Dot Pixis after Imperial Japanese Army General Akiyama Yoshifuru. However, this raised a heated discussion and death threats on his blog in 2013, with angry participants questioning Akiyama's participation or lack thereof in the Sino-Japanese War and the Imperial Japanese rule over Korea. Pixis is voiced by Masahiko Tanaka in Japanese. In the Funimation English version, his last name is spelled Pyxis and he is voiced by R Bruce Elliott. ; : Rico Brzenska is the team leader of Squad Rico and a member of the Garrison's 1st Division Elite Forces. She is the sole surviving leader of the Alpha Squad assigned to defend Eren during the liberation of Trost District from the Titans. At first, it may appear as though she does not feel sympathy as she was very open to the idea of killing Eren, Mikasa, and Armin after it was discovered that Eren has the power of the Titans. Later, began to lose her calm demeanor as the Titans gradually wiped out her comrades. However, for the most part, she maintains a composed, leadership role, and bravely cuts a Titan's eye out when it interferes with Eren's carrying the boulder. Once Trost is reclaimed, Rico sits among the wasteland of corpses and begins to shed tears for her fallen comrades, and for the first victory for humanity over the Titans. She, Ian Dietrich and Mitabi Jarnach were in the same training corps class.Bessatu Magazine, February 2017 issue. Brzenska's last name is traditionally a Polish surname in origin. She is voiced by Michiko Kaiden in Japanese and Morgan Garrett in the English Funimation dub. Military Police Brigade The is a gendarmerie composed of soldiers assigned to watch over the Training Corps, supervise the Garrison Regiment, control the fire departments, and arrest and detain political criminals and offenders. The top ten of each training class are eligible to join, although some experienced members can transfer from the Garrison. As their tasks mainly involve administrative behind-the-scenes work, they do not experience front- line combat with Titans and often reside in the comfort and safety of the innermost wall. The Military Police Brigade's insignia is a white-haired green unicorn. ; : Commander of the Military Police Brigade. During Eren's tribunal, Nile pleaded the side that Eren should be handed to the Military Police Brigade for examination and then executed, believing Eren's presence in the populace would cause a civil war. When Eren called him a coward, he wanted Eren to be shot, but Levi stopped him. When the Female Titan suddenly appeared within Wall Sheena, Nile angrily demands an explanation from Erwin, suspecting he is planning a coup. But after learning about Erwin's plans, he decides to help by ordering the Military Police to assist the Survey Corps in capturing the Female Titan. In the English version, his name is spelled Nile Dawk. : In the anime, Nile is voiced by Anri Katsu in Japanese and by Ian Sinclair in English. ; : Marlowe is introduced during the Raid of Stohess District storyline as a Military Police member who is given a bit of leadership responsibility. He is aware of the corruption in the organization and desires to reform it, although that draws some criticism from Annie. In the anime series, his name is and tries to demonstrate his leadership in a different way; he tries to stand up against two corrupt superiors who are selling guns on the black market, where Annie then encourages Marlowe to keep gathering his strength. After the battle between the Female and Attack Titan, he and Hitch are seen cleaning up dead bodies. : In a later manga storyline, on patrol, he defends the Survey Corps, stating they had just caught a Titan which is something no one else in the other military factions has done. When they are caught by Levi's squad, Marlowe wants to help them out, but Levi refuses, stating they can't be trusted. He and Hitch are left in Jean's custody. Deciding to test him, Jean gets into a brief fist fight with Marlowe. The latter tells Hitch to run and that he'll hold him off. After a while, Jean decides he can be trusted and Marlowe's want for justice is similar to Eren's, echoing Annie's earlier observation. However, Hitch returns and attacks him, still thinking he plans on killing Marlowe. Marlowe tells her it was just a test. He is among a number of soldiers who transfer into the Survey Corps to help strengthen the dwindling numbers despite Hitch trying to convince him otherwise. He is among the soldiers killed during the attempt to retake Wall Maria, being struck in the head by a rock while distracting the Beast Titan in an attempt to allow Levi to ambush it. : He is oblivious to the fact that Hitch has feelings for him, despite it being very obvious (and the reason she tried to get him to stay with the MPs). When he first transfers into the Corps and is having dinner with Eren's group, he is teased by them for this obliviousness and seems surprised that Hitch would be romantically interested in him. He later appears to come to the realization that he returns Hitch's feelings; however, he is killed shortly thereafter. : In the Japanese dub of the anime, Marlowe is voiced by Tomokazu Sugita. In the English dub, his name is spelled Marlo Sand and he is voiced by Todd Haberkorn. ; : Annie, Marlowe, and Boris' female comrade in the Military Police, she likes to poke fun of both Annie and Marlowe. She is also Annie's roommate.: She is voiced by Akeno Watanabe in the Japanese dub and by Brittney Karbowski in the English dub. Unlike Annie, who was able to join the Military Police due to being the top ten of her class, Hitch only got in the Military Police by having an improper relationship with a superior in order to gain a favorable position. Both she and Marlowe are involved in the cleanup in the capital after the fight between the Female and Attack Titan. When the two of them are captured by Levi's group, she frantically asks where Annie is, implying that Hitch actually cares about Annie and the teasing is probably a cover-up. She learns the truth and is left in Jean's custody. When Jean pretends to kill them, Marlowe fights back and tells Hitch to run to safety, but she returns with a stick to attack Jean, hoping to save Marlowe. However, Marlowe stops her, stating that Jean was just testing them. Hitch remains in the Military Police after the incident, trying to persuade Marlowe in vain not to transfer to the Survey Corps. She later discovers Annie escaping from the underground, and assists her in heading to Shiganshina District. She's heavily implied to have had a crush on Marlowe, giving a reason for why she picked on him. ; : One of the nicer members of the Military Police who is kind to Annie. He's in the same squad as her, Hitch, and Marlo(we). He is voiced by Yūichi Karasuma in the Japanese dub and by Micah Solusod in the English version. Boris respects Annie since she fought during the Battle of Trost, therefore she is the only member in the squad who has combat experience and an actual encounter with Titans. However, he doesn't like Hitch's misconduct towards Annie and quickly points out her flaws, including the fact that Hitch didn't earn her position like Annie did, instead sleeping her way to the top. While Boris is aware of the corruption within the Military Police, he chooses to accept that it's part of the system. When Marlowe declares his ambition to reform the system by rising through the top, he unenthusiastically wishes him good luck. =First Interior Squad= The , also known as the Interior Police, is a secret police division that, despite being under the Military Police organization in name, operates completely independently from the main body of the Military Police Brigade. They have been shown to be far more skilled and disciplined than the rest of the Military Police, though their main specialties are in fighting other humans rather than Titans. No one is officially overseeing their activities and they operate as if above the law, even Nile Dok is often unaware of their actions until informed by someone else. Shrouded in mystery, the Interior Squad is involved in numerous conspiracies involving torture and assassinations to maintain order within the Walls and is rarely seen outside the capitol. While most of the operatives are dead during the conflict with Rod Reiss, the rest of them are restrained by the soldiers on the side of Dot Pyxis and Dhalis Zachary. ; : Serving directly under the Reiss family after being brought into their services by Rod's younger brother Uri, whom he deeply respected, Kenny leads the , an elite counterinsurgency unit equipped with Vertical Maneuvering Equipment specifically designed for killing humans.

Kenny becomes an infamous criminal hitman nicknamed as and murdered Military Police officials before meeting Uri who resented the Ackerman persecution. He is the maternal uncle of Levi, raising the latter for a short time after his younger sister Kuchel died of a venereal illness. In the storyline, seeing through the Survey Corps's plan to stage a revolution, Kenny kidnaps Eren and Historia under orders from Rod. But after learning of Rod's intentions for Historia, Kenny decides to betray Rod by partially freeing Eren so he can fight back. After Rod transforms into a Titan, Kenny is fatally wounded when the chapel collapses.

He first appears in the Uprising Arc during a conference with four other people where one of them is a member of the Military Police Brigade. Fritz does not wear his crown during this conference, but instead leaves it on the table beside him along with a bottle of alcohol. Fritz presided over the trial of Erwin Smith where he was dozing through it as the other nobles actually conduct the trial. He is later exposed by the Survey Corps with the help of Nile Dok and Commander Pyxis. When Dhalis Zachary interrupts the trial and begins the arrest of the nobles involved with Rod Reiss, Aurille angrily kicks the throne as Fritz (who is sleeping with his eyes open the whole time) gets a rude awakening and confusedly asks if it is time to eat. Aurille tells him to shut up as Aurille is restrained.

When Historia was born, Rod send her and her mother to live on a land he leased to the latter's parents. But when his entire family was slaughtered by Grisha Yeager when he stole the Founding Titan during the Wall Maria incident, Rod attempts to bring Historia to live with him as he intended to use her to quickly restore the order Grisha disrupted. But the Wall Cult were unaware of his true intentions and sent Kenny Ackerman to kill Historia, with Rod convincing the soldier to let her join the Survey Corps under the alias of Krista Lenz. Reunited with his daughter, Rod reveals to Eren the truth of how his father made him a Titan before convincing Historia to eat Eren. But Historia's refusal forces Rod to transform himself into a massive and crawling Abnormal Titan that is tall and wide while continuously burning, threatening the Orvud District. After being heavily crippled by the Levi Squad and Eren using a cache of barrels filled with gunpowder, Rod is killed when Historia personally makes the death blow on the nape. In his final moments, Rod transmits some of his memories into his daughter to better understand the situation that would soon come to Paradis with his death. Rod is voiced by Yusaku Yara in the Japanese version and by Kenny Green in the English version. ; Frieda Reiss (フリーダ・レイス, Furīda Reisu) : A woman who has appeared in Eren's dream, Freida is later revealed to be Historia's older half-sister by Rod's wife. She was a kind-hearted person, welcomed by the people in the Reiss family's domain, and cared for Historia. She originally obtained the Founding Titan at age fifteen from her uncle Uri Reiss, gaining the power to assume Titan form, manipulate memories, and endowed with the collective knowledge of human history. Frieda also taught Historia to read and be a kind person, later erasing herself for her half sister's memory when she wanted to be like her. As Frieda was inexperienced in controlling Titans, she was killed and eaten by Grisha Yeager during the fall of Wall Maria when she and her family took refuge in a church. Rod covered up her death to make it appear to be the work of bandits. As a previous Founding Titan, Freida's memories were passed on Grisha and then Eren who eventually learned her identity.

After a coup d'état that resulted in the arrest of King Fritz and those loyal to Rod Reiss as well as the death of Rod Reiss, the Royal Government was reorganized with them now working for Historia Reiss. ; : Aurille is a noble who is loyal to King Fritz and Rod Reiss. When it came to Erwin Smith's trial where he is accused of not giving Eren Yeager to the Royal Government, he and the other nobles heard about the Colossal Titan and the Armored Titan having breached Wall Rose. When Dot Pyxis gives orders to establish an evacuation route, Aurille counters by ordering that Wall Sina be closed off to prevent a civil war. When Dhalis Zachary arrives and reveals that the Titan attack is fake, Aurille claims that they stand by their king while Zachary states that a newspaper was published revealing the framing of the Scout Regiment. This led to Aurille and those involved with Rod Reiss being arrested. Aurille was tortured by Zachary where he was made to eat his own feces through a machine that he is hooked up to while also planning to parade him around in just the shoes and socks that he is currently wearing. When Historia is sworn in as the Queen of the Walls following Rod Reiss' death, Aurille was seen in a prison cell. ; : Deltoff is a noble who is loyal to King Fritz and Rodd Reiss. At one of the noblemen's meetings, Deltoff gets word from Rod Reiss stating that he had Eren Yeager and Historia Reiss captured. He was present at Erwin Smith's trial. When Dot Pyxis and Dhalis Zachary begin their coup d'état, Deltoff and those involved are arrested. When Historia is sworn in as the Queen of the Walls following Rod Reiss' death, Deltoff was seen in a prison cell. ; : Gerald is a noble who is loyal to King Fritz and Rod Reiss. At one of the noblemen's meetings, Gerald gets word from Rod Reiss stating that he had Eren Yeager and Historia Reiss captured. He was present at Erwin Smith's trial where he stated that Erwin failed to hand Eren Yeager to them. When Dot Pyxis and Dhalis Zachary begin their coup d'état, Gerald and those involved with Rod Reiss are arrested. When Historia is sworn in as the Queen of the Walls following Rod Reiss' death, Gerald was seen in a prison cell. ; : Roderich is a noble who is loyal to King Fritz and Rod Reiss. He was first seen with Pastor Nick at a meeting with politicians following the Assault on Stohess. At one of the noblemen's meetings, Roderich gets word from Rod Reiss stating that he had Eren Yeager and Historia Reiss captured. He was present at Erwin Smith's trial where he stated that Erwin failed to hand Eren Yeager to them. When Dot Pyxis and Dhalis Zachary begin their coup d'état, Roderich and those involved with Rod Reiss are arrested. When Historia is sworn in as the Queen of the Walls following Rod Reiss' death, Roderich was seen in a prison cell. Civilians ; : Eren's father and Mikasa's guardian. He is a renowned medical doctor who was well respected in the District of Shiganshina after he saved the village from a devastating plague. He also provides a house call medical service to the people of Shiganshina and to various towns in addition to having a network of contacts within the Corps of the Shiganshina district. : Though Eren and the others believed he went into hiding after the fall of Wall Maria, they would later learn that Grisha was more than he appeared. Grisha's life story is later revealed from his memoir books and Eren's inherited memories — he is an ethnic Eldian from Marley's Liberio Internment Zone, having been disillusioned with his father since the cover-up of his younger sister's death by a Public Security officer named Gross and joining the Eldian Restorationists seven years later. Grisha married Dina Fritz and they had a son named Zeke, whom he attempted to use in a scheme to acquire the Founding Titan by having him participate in Marley's Warrior program. But he was instead sold out by Zeke with him, Dina and all the Restorationists sentenced to exile in Paradis as Pure Titans. But Grisha is saved by Eren Kruger, who slaughters the Marleyan overseers and gives him the Attack Titan to carry out the mission to capture the Founding Titan. : After making his way to Wall Maria where he met Keith Shadis, Grisha settled in Shiganshina and became a local hero after curing the townspeople of the plague while starting a new family with Carla and their son Eren. While Grisha tracked down the Reiss family, he made no attempt on them until the day of Wall Maria fell when he begged Freida to stop the Titan invasion and save Shiganshina. When Frieda refused, Grisha is metaphysically manipulated via a future version of Eren into devouring her for the Founding Titan and slaughter most of her family. While horrified from seeing future events after being devoured by his son as a Pure Titan, Grisha finds Eren at a Trost refugee camp and gives his son the key to their house's basement where hid the \\"truth\\" before injecting him with Titan serum. : Eren suffered amnesia after inheriting Grisha's Titan power until he touched Historia Reiss, ashamed his father's actions while Historia later came to her own conclusion that Grisha may had a logical reason for killing her half-sister. After the Survey Corps' pyrrhic victory at Shiganshina and the recapture of Wall Maria, Eren, Mikasa, Levi and Hange reach Grisha's basement and find three books written by Grisha inside a hidden drawer containing a photograph of Grisha with his first family, and the truth that humanity is not only not extinct, but thriving outside the Walls. The information from Grisha's memoir is later released to the public by Historia's order. While Zeke attempted to use the Founding Titan to convince Eren that their father manipulated them, he unknowingly allowed his half-brother to manipulate Grisha who begs Zeke's forgiveness while beseeching him to stop Eren. : Grisha is voiced by Hiroshi Tsuchida in the anime. In the English dub, his name is spelled Grisha Jaeger and he is voiced by Chris Hury. ; : Eren's mother and Mikasa's guardian. Kalura was originally a waitress in Shiganshina who fell in love with Grisha after he saved her and others from a plague.. She was in opposition to Eren's decision to join the Survey Corps and tried to get Mikasa to change his mind. When her town is attacked, she becomes trapped under the Yeager family home from debris of Wall Maria. Eren and Mikasa try to save her, although her lower body was already crushed and she entrusted them to Hannes to save. As they flee, Eren looked on as Carla is picked up and devoured by the Titan that was originally Dina Yeager. : Kalura's given name is sometimes spelled Carla in various Attack on Titan media. She is voiced by Yoshino Takamori in the Japanese dub of the anime. In the Funimation English version, her name is Carla Jaeger and she is voiced by Jessica Cavanagh. ; : Kaya is a civilian girl living in a village near Dauper, Sasha Blouse's home village. When Titans appear within Wall Rose, the village does not receive warning and is attacked. Kaya and her mother are abandoned by fellow villagers due to her mother's bad legs. As a small Titan begins eating her mother alive, Kaya is immobilized by a state of shock. She is rescued when Sasha (who is tasked to warn the villages) arrives, but Sasha's frightened horse runs off without them and they are forced to flee on foot. Sasha tells Kaya to escape alone and stays behind to fend off the Titan with nothing but a bow and small quiverful of arrows. Kaya eventually runs into a group of men from Sasha's village, and directs them back to help Sasha. She is later taken in by Sasha's parents along with other orphans. : In 854, while walking the Blouse family's dogs, Kaya overhears two children (Gabi Braun and Falco Grice) arguing in the forest and goes to investigate. Though realizing that they were the recently escaped Marleyan prisoners, Kaya sees they are hungry and kindly invites them home to eat. She later takes them to the ruins of her village, and recounts the story of her mother's death, and confronts them to explain what wrong her mother did to deserve the fate she got. However, inspired to be a selfless person like Sasha, she decides not to turn them in, and offers to take them to a restaurant where a few of the Marleyan captive works to see if there is a way for them to return home, when the Blouse family has been invited to dine. However, the Marleyan chef Niccolo violently attacks the two Marleyan children when he finds out that Gabi was responsible for killing Sasha, whom he is in love with. When Mr. Blouse refuses Niccolo's demand to kill Gabi, an enraged Kaya grabs the knife and attempts to stab Gabi before being restrained by Mikasa and the Blouses. Titans The are the primary antagonists of the series. They are giant creatures that usually resemble nude male humans in form, although lacking reproductive organs. They can range in height from . Despite their enormous strength and toughness, their bodies are unnaturally light for their size. Their primary instinct is to eat humans, as they show no interest in attacking other animals. However, they seem to operate on sunlight and do not require food or drink to survive, and would typically later vomit up the remains of those they devoured. They have hard skin and regenerative abilities, and can only be killed by inflicting a deep incision at the nape of the neck. They have high body temperatures, causing them to emit steam. Most Titans, known as , are slow and clumsy, show no signs of intelligence and act like mindless beasts with a compulsion to eat any human they come across. But some Pure Titans, referred to as , are fast moving and intelligent enough to ignore nearby humans for larger populations. The Fritz royal family, who inherited the Founding Titan power from Ymir Fritz, have the ability to create and control Pure Titans using a special serum created from the spinal fluid of Titans. It would later be revealed that the Titans originate from a special race of people known as , who are the only humans known to be reactive to Titan serum. These people once used the Titan power to establish a glorious empire named , and are hence called the . The Eldians conquered the continent and subjugated the nation of Marley for 1,700 years, and have been addressed as the by the Marleyans. ; : A mythical figure tied to the origins of the Titans who lived around 1,800 years ago, mentioned only in fairy tales to become the when she made a pact with a being called the to establish a nation for her descendants. In reality, Ymir was a slave girl who acquired her Titan ability by accident and was exploited by her master Fritz to establish a kingdom and bear their daughters Maria, Rose, and Sheena (namesakes of Paradis' three Walls). Ymir died 13 years later with her body force-fed to her daughters as Fritz uses them and their children to maintain their lineage's power, Ymir's spirit resides within the Coordinate, forced to obey the command of those among her direct descendants who inherited the Founding Titan's power. When Eren and Zeke manage to enter the Coordinate, the latter revealed to have nullified Karl Fritz's renouncement vow to personally engage his scheme of sterilizing all Subjects of Ymir, Eren manages to convince Ymir to aid him of her own freewill in exterminating all life outside Paradis. ; : A descendant of Ymir Fritz and the 145th king of Eldia, as well as the 1st King of the Walls on Paradis. A pacifist by nature who inherited the Founding Titan, Karl detested his ancestors for the atrocities they caused and the civil war among the other Eldian houses. This influenced him into orchestrating Eldia's downfall with the Tybur family, secretly moving the capital to the eastern island of Paradis while the Tyburs used the oppressed people of Marley to stage the Great Titan War and become the ruling government. Once Shingansina was established, intending to separate his people from the rest of the world to live in peace, Karl used his power to wipe the memories of everyone that is a Subject of Ymir. But Karl learned some Eldians were immune, having the Ackermans who served his family persecuted while awarding others who compelled with nobility. Living on through the Founding Titan power to influence his blood-related successors, Karl then established the Reiss Family to continue his bloodline with his heirs maintaining the ceasefire between Paradis and Marley with only Historia his last living heir. Some relatives of Karl remained in Marley and eventually dwindled with Zeke Yeager as the last of that line, concealing it from the Marleyans to maintain his freedom and later using a means to nullify Karl's influence. Nine Titans Some Eldian humans, known as , can transform to-and-back between a consciously intelligent Titan and human form at will. Their transformation is triggered by an inflicted injury, but also requires a clear, dedicated goal in mind. While in the Titan form, the human's normal body rests in the nape of the neck, connected via masses of muscular tissue. Ymir Friz is generally considered the very first Titan Shifter. The are nine Titan Shifter lineages that have been passed down through the Eldian people for nearly 2,000 years after Ymir Fritz's death, each of them having inherited a ninth of Ymir's soul and possessing a unique set of . These inheritors of her Shifter power are also subjected to what is known as the and doomed to die after 13 years with accelerated ageing and physical decline (since Ymir died 13 years after acquiring her power and nobody can exceed hers), and their Shifter power must be passed onto someone else. The succession of the Nine Titans' power is tied to a form of cannibalism, with a successor being administered a Titan serum and transformed into a Pure Titan that acts on instinct to devour the current holder and consume the predecessor's spinal fluid, inheriting the power and cumulative memories of all previous holders. If a Titan Shifter dies without being consumed, the Titan power can be passed to a random Eldian child born at the time of the current holder's death by other interdimensional means, regardless of distance. During the reign of the ancient Eldian Empire, the Nine Titans normally resided within noble families, as family relations play a significant role in passing inheriting memories from the previous inheritors of the Titan power. These houses were in a constant conflict with the Fritz family using the Founding Titan to maintain the peace. But the 145th Eldian King Karl Fritz felt great shame for his people's actions and carried sympathy for Marley, a former nation which the Eldians conquered and oppressed and collaborated the story of a Marleyan named Helos with the Tybur family to destroy their nation from the inside while rallying the Marleyans into inciting the Great Titan War. In the aftermath, Fritz took some of his subjects to Paradis and turn some into titans who formed the walls' foundation while most of the rest had their memories altered. With only the Attack Titan unaccounted for, Marley seized control of the other Nine Titans while the Tybur family were allowed to keep the War Hammer Titan for supporting Marley. By the beginning of the series, the Reiss family and the Tybur family were the only remaining bloodlines of Eldian nobility as the other Titans were distributed to Marleyian loyalists that would be utilized as the Warriors. The powers of Nine Titans can be merged if one Titan Shifter devours another, as with the case of Grisha Yeager, an inheritor of the Attack Titan, devouring Frieda Reiss to steal Founding Titan from the Reiss family, reducing the number of Titan Shifters to eight. Eren would repeat this when he acquires the War Hammer Titan from the younger sister of Willy Tybur, bringing the number of Titan Shifters down to seven. ; : The Founding Titan (also translated as the Progenitor Titan) is the first of all Titans and fabled to be the strongest of all, though its full power was gradually divided among the other Titans following Ymir's death. By , the holder can manipulate Subjects of Ymir in ways that include memory alteration or biological changes like transforming them into army Titans under the user's command. But the Founding Titan's can only be used by someone either with the Fritz royal family bloodline, or in direct physical contact with someone of royal blood. According to Marley's Titan Biology Research Society, the Founding Titan is the point where interdimensional \\"paths\\" that connect all Subjects of Ymir and Titans intersect, and its power is coined by the Marleyans as the . The Founding Titan was previously inherited through the Fritz/Reiss family, but is currently possessed by Eren Yeager, who is not of royal blood and therefore a dormant holder of its power. But as Eren learned, the Founding Titan's power only belongs to the royal bloodline because of Ymir Fritz's persistent loyalty to her heartless Fritz King husband, so he eventually gains the full ability to use the Founding Titan's power after convincing Ymir, who has been posthumously trapped inside the alternate dimension of the Coordinate for 2,000 years, to entrust her power to him and be finally freed. ; : The Attack Titan (also translated as the Attacking Titan) is said to always move ahead seeking and fighting for freedom throughout the generations. In addition to accessing memories of previous hosts, the Attack Titan can also allow its current user to see into the future through future user's eyes, even retroactively manipulating the actions of past users by subliminal persuasion. In the aftermath of the Great Titan War, the Attack Titan was kept from falling into Marley's hands and remained hidden on the mainland. The Attack Titan was previously possessed by the Eldian sleeper agent Eren Kruger, who passed the power to Grisha Yeager, and is currently in the possession of Grisha's younger son Eren, who actually manipulated the conditions of his acquiring it. Besides also possess the powers of the Founding Titan which were later awakened, Eren later enhances the Attack Titan after ingesting a hardening serum and gaining the powers of the War Hammer Titan. ; : The Colossus Titan (also translated as the Colossal Titan) is infamous for its incredible size, standing at a previously unseen , tall enough to peer over the top of the Walls. It also possesses incredible physical strength, able to destroy the outer gate of Wall Maria with a single kick, launch entire houses in the air, and send Eren's Attack Titan flying from the ground crashing into the top of Wall Maria. Although all Titans generate enormous amounts of heat and energy when transforming, the Colossus Titan takes this to the next level — it is capable of emitting great amounts of steam at will while exercising significant control over the amount and intensity of steam emitted by its Titan body. However, prolonged use of this ability takes a toll on the Titan, gradually decreasing its muscle mass until only the skeletal structure remains. The Colossus Titan was previously possessed by the Marleyan Warrior Bertolt Hoover, and is currently in the possession of Armin Arlert. ; : The Armored Titan is covered by hardened, armor plating-like skin across its body, except in key joint areas necessary for movement. Its armor is capable of protecting the Titan form from significant amounts of damage, even a direct hit from a cannon or the ultrahard steel blades of the Paradis Scout Regiment, although it can be defeated by high-power weaponries such as the Scout's Thunder Spear shaped charges and the Mid-East Allied Forces' anti-Titan artillery. The hardened skin however is heavy and can restrain movements, and the Armored Titan is only capable of maintaining moderate running speeds when completely armored unless it voluntarily sheds segments of the armor (e.g. behind the knees). The Armored Titan is currently in the possession of Reiner Braun, whose 13-year tenure is expiring with his cousin Gabi Braun an eligible candidate to inherit his power. ; : The Female Titan is the only one of the Nine Titans to display a distinctly female figure, and is known for its high mobility and versatile combat abilities. Like the Armored Titan, it possesses the ability to harden its skin, though only over limited areas. This hardening ability does make its melee attacks significantly stronger, as a single well- placed blow with a hardened limb can dismember or even decapitate other Titans. Similar to the Founding Titan and Zeke Yeager's Beast Titan, the Female Titan is able to exercise some influence over Pure Titans through a scream. Its scream will attract Pure Titans to its location, but it has no control over the Pure Titans' behavior and they will attack and try to eat it. The Female Titan is currently possessed by Annie Leonhart, who had used the hardening ability to encase herself in a crystal cocoon to prevent interrogation. ; : The Beast Titan has a unique Bigfoot-like appearance with a hairless midriff and is slightly larger than most Titans. It has a devastating ability to throw objects (such as boulders) with great accuracy and immense destructive capability. The Beast Titan was previously held by Titan scientist Tom Xaver, and is currently in the possession of Grisha's elder son Zeke Yeager, whose status as a descendant of Karl Fritz gives him abilities the previous Beast Titans lacked. Similar to the Founding Titan, Zeke's Beast Titan can create Pure Titans with a roar if a Subject of Ymir is exposed to Zeke's spinal fluid, and can command the movements of the created Titans using vocal commands. Titans under Zeke's control are even able to function at night using only moonlight. But this ability is evidently imperfect, as some Titans can somewhat still ignore Zeke's Beast Titan's orders. ; : The Jaw Titan is considered the swiftest of the Nine Titans thanks to its small size, and has ferocious biting strength in its jaws and incredibly powerful fingernails which can be used with devastating efficiency against both Titans and man-made structures, and can even chew through hardened Titan armor as well as the crystalized shell of the War Hammer Titan. The Jaw Titan was previously possessed by Marcel Galliard until was devoured by Ymir when she was a Pure Titan, inheriting the power before it was passed to Marcel's brother Porco Galliard. The Jaw Titan is currently possessed by Falco Grice after devouring Porco when he sacrifices himself to save Reiner from the Pure Titan the boy was turned into. ; : The Cart Titan (also translated as the Cartman Titan or Quadrupedal Titan) has an unusual quadrupedal posture, with a great speed rivalling the Jaw Titan, and a level of endurance greater than that of the other Nine Titans, allowing for it to partake in long missions without needing to rest. As a side-effect, prolonged duration of the Titan form would make the user liable to forget how to walk normally and will have to crawl instead. The Cart Titan is currently in the possession of Pieck. ; : The War Hammer Titan can produce and manipulate structures using hardened Titan flesh, and well as forming weaponized large spikes to impale a Titan, and manifest such spikes into a signature war hammer. The Titan can also be operated by the shifter using a small \\"flesh cable\\", which allows the user to externally control the Titan form. Much like the Female Titan, it also has hardening ability, which can also be used to encase the human operator in a crystal for protection. The War Hammer Titan was previously inherited through the Tybur family, and was in the possession of Willy Tybur's sister. When Lady Tybur was crushed and killed during the Battle of Liberio, her blood and bodily fluid was consumed by the Attack Titan, making Eren Yeager the current holder. Pure Titans ; :A Titan and a tall Titan captured by Eren for Hange's studies. With them, Hange discovers that Titans require sunlight to operate, as Sonny becomes lethargic without sunlight, but Bean is still active. In the anime, Hange says they were named after Sawney Bean, the leader of a clan of cannibals who hunted and ate their victims before the authorities led by King James found their secret cave, apprehended them, and executed them. Both are killed by Annie Leonhart. : In the English dub, they are referred to as Sawney and Beane and are voiced by Jonathan C. Osborne and Cris George respectively. =Wall Titans= Thousands of Pure Titans that resemble the Colossus Titan in appearance and abilities. They have been entombed within the three Walls of Paradis by King Fritz using their hardening abilities to deter an immediate attack from Marley. Except for the Founding Titan's orders, these Titans are absolutely unstoppable. They are faster than horses and according to Hange, they can destroy the Marleyan mainland in about four days. Exasperated with Marley's racial violence against the Subjects of Ymir, Eren unleashes the Wall Titans and commands them to destroy Marley. Two days later, the Wall Titans invade Marley and demolish its north eastern territories. Marley is a large empire located beyond the Walls and across the ocean from Paradis. It consists of an enormous continental mainland as well as many overseas territories. Marley was originally conquered by the Subjects of Ymir who established the Empire of Eldia using the Nine Titans, but King Karl Fritz collaborated with the Tybur family to allow the Marleyans overthrow his own empire during the Great Titan War. With Karl's involvement in their uprising concealed, the Marleyans seized control of seven of the Titans and subjugated most of Eldia with the exception of Paradis. The Eldian population remained on the home continent that did not migrate with King Karl to Paradis Island have since been forced to be subjugated by the Marleyans, who despised Eldians as subhumans and treated them cruelly as second-class citizens confined to segregated lives within the gated , where the Eldians are forced to wear armbands with a 9-pointed star as a badge of shame and forbided to leave Liberio without permits. Any Eldian deemed disobedient to the Marleyan rule (not wearing armbands, leaving Liberio without permits, planning uprisings, or even just joining religious groups) will be punished by the via torture and murder, and even worse, exile as Pure Titans onto Paradis so they can mindlessly devour their compatriots on the island. Despite the hatred towards the Eldians, Marleyans still rely on Eldians as cheap cannon fodders to conquer other nations and expand Marley's territory. In the modern era, it has become increasingly harder for Marley to still uses Eldian-transformed Titans as convenient weapons of mass destruction to maintain its status as a dominant world power, as other nations are all making technological progresses that can offset Marley's Titan advantage. The is the combined armed forces of Marley, consisting primarily of the (which includes the infamous Warrior Unit) and the . Marley maintains its military dominance in the world stage by the use of five (formerly seven before the failure of the Paradis Island Operation) of the Nine Titans and a technologically moderate military force, which is not as developed as that of other powers around the world. The overall size of the Marleyan military stationed around Liberio exceeds 30,000 soldiers. ; : The of the Marleyan military forces. Being Marleyan by heritage, he was proud of his country's glorious history against the Eldian Empire, but he had also shown distress towards Marley's weakening status in the modern age. He shared his subordinates' racist contempt of Eldians, although it was expressed with more subtlety. ; : A of the Eldian Unit of the Marley army and formerly one of the chief overseers of the first Warrior candidates during their training. He later led the Eldian Warriors in the war against the Mid-East Allied Forces, playing a key role in Marley's crucial capture of Fort Slava and destruction of the Alliance fleet. Through the support of Willy Tybur and the governmental party of Marley along with the death of General Calvi and most of the Marleyan high command, Magath is next in line to become the general of the Marleyan military forces. Warrior Unit The is a subdivision of the Marleyan military's Eldian Unit, which consists of ethnic Eldian conscripts. Most Warrior cadets are recruited and trained from childhood, expected to carry out the needs of their superiors without question or objection, and serve as expendable shock troops on the battlefield, performing the riskiest and most dangerous tasks and strategies while the other Marleyan soldiers remain out of harm's way. When the need arises, the Warrior who demonstrates the most exceptional performance on the battlefield is given the privilege of inheriting one of the six Shifter Titans (Beast, Cartman, Armored, Colossus, Female and Jaws) which Marley obtained during the Great Titan War. Due to the rarity of these individuals, efforts are taken to ensure that, if possible, these Warriors are not put into situations which could lead to the loss of one of Marley's Titans. The Titan Shifter inheritors along with their families are granted privileges of and can have basic human rights almost equal to ordinary Marleyans, though these rights can be revoked any time by the Marleyan authority. ; : The \\"warchief\\" of the Marley's Warrior Unit and the holder of the \\"Beast Titan\\". In his Titan form, Zeke is a tall Bigfoot-like creature with long, thin arms which can be used to launch projectiles at long distances. Due to belonging to the royal Fritz bloodline, his spinal fluid can also be used to turn other Eldians into Titans completely under his control. Additionally, Zeke is a charismatic leader and proficient strategist who can utilize his subordinates' capabilities to deadly effect on the battlefield. He emerges as one of the series' main antagonists following his introduction in the manga's ninth volume (i.e. the beginning of the anime's second season). : Zeke is Grisha Yeager's firstborn son with Dina Fritz, and Eren's older half- brother. Indoctrinated since birth to become the Eldian Resistance's vanguard by infiltrating Marley's ranks, Zeke grew to resent his parents for consistently prioritizing their plans of Eldian restoration over his well- being. When he learns that the Marleyan authorities are rapidly closing in on the Eldian Restoration Movement, Zeke betrays his parents to save himself and conceal his identity as a descendant of Karl Fritz. After inheriting the power of the , he resolves to seize the Founding Titan and use it to \\"save\\" the Eldian people from further persecution by sterilizing them. : After becoming the Warrior Unit's leader, Zeke oversees the training of Bertholt, Reiner, and Annie before they are sent to seize the Founding Titan from Paradis. Following the trio's failure, he leads another Marleyan attack on Paradis. Upon infiltrating Wall Rose's interior, he transforms Ragako's residents into Titans before proceeding to terrorize the surrounding population Ultimately, Zeke makes contact with Reiner and Bertholt before conscripting them to take part in an ambush on the Survey Corps as they attempt to seal the breach to Wall Maria and reclaim the city of Shinganshina, . Once Eren seals Wall Maria's outer gate, Zeke cuts off part of the Survey Corps south of the inner gate while entrusting Reiner and Bertholt with eliminating the rest of the contingent within Shanginshina. Despite all but destroying the Corps' existing roster, assuming Eren to be manipulated by their father, Zeke is forced to retreat after Reiner and Bertholt are defeated and he is nearly killed by Levi. During Paradis's five year period of peace, Zeke secretly defected to their side under false pretenses while convincing Marley's military leadership to resume their attack on the walls. After enlisting Eren to stage a surprise attack on international summit hosted by Marley to acquire the War Hammer Titan and decimate Marley's high command, Zeke is briefly detained by Paradis before he and Eren incite a rebellion that plunges the country into chaos. Though Zeke deceives Eren so he can enter the Coordinate and command Ymir to sterilize all Subjects of Ymir, he is horrified to realize that Eren manipulated their father through the Attack Titan. : Zeke is voiced by Takehito Koyasu in the Japanese version of the anime and by Jason Liebrecht in the English dub. ; : A reserved member of 104th Training Corps who graduated 3rd in his class and open up around Reiner, Bertolt is described as having potential to master every skill he has been taught if he had the motivation for it. Berholt is a member of the Warriors and part of Reiner's infiltration team to capture the Founding Titan. He is also the holder of the , becoming a skinless Titan who can release hot steam to protect himself and repel his opponents. Berholt used his Titan power to instigate the Wall Maria incident for his group's infiltration and later breach Wall Trost a few years later to force the Founding Titan's user into the open.. The reason Berholt joined the Warriors was so his bedridden father can be provided medical care by the Marleyans, caring a cover story that he came from same village as Reiner.. In Volume 12, Reiner hints that Bertolt is in love with Annie. Bertolt is later forced to reveal his true allegiance after Reiner finally broke and exposed them. In a later battle at Shinganshina, he is captured by Eren, and left to be eaten by Armin, who was injected with the Titan serum to have the former regain his human form. After Reiner returned to Marley, he learned from his mother that Bertolt's father, content of his son's patriotic devotion to Marley, peacefully passed away during their mission. : Bertolt is voiced by Tomohisa Hashizume in the Japanese anime. In the English dub, his name is spelled Bertholdt Hoover and he is voiced by David Matranga. ; : An Eldian cadet of the Marleyan Warriors, Annie is introduced as a cadet in the 104th Training Corps, where she graduated ranking 4th in her class. She has short blonde hair and is a small-statured loner who is skilled in melee combat, having been raised by her father to consider the world her enemy. Annie is later revealed to be a member of the Warriors and part of Reiner's infiltration team to capture the Founding Titan. She is also the holder of the , a Titan with an unprecedented feminine body structure who can harden parts of her skin and quickly heal herself. : As a cadet, she teaches Eren some of her melee skills, and later joins the Military Police, where she is seen as the quiet girl. Following the Battle of Trost after her group deduces Eren, Annie played a role in Marco Bott's death to conceal her group's cover while later using Marco's Gear to personally kill the captive Titans Sawney and Bean. Annie later assumes her Titan form to ambush the 57th expedition to Wall Maria while searching for Eren, using the intel Reiner secretly gave her to briefly capture him while killing off Levi's special operations squad. Annie is outed during the Stohess District storyline once Armin deduces that she killed Sonny and Bean. Following her defeat, Annie encases herself in crystal to prevent further probing as to her motives. But Annie would later be revived a few years later when Eren used the Founding Titan's power to undo all hardened Titans on Paradis. : Annie is voiced by Yū Shimamura in the Japanese anime. In the English dub, she is voiced by Lauren Landa. At Magic City Comic- Con 2015, Landa said that she used a low-pitched and emotionless voice in portraying Annie. ; : An Eldian cadet of the Marleyan Warrior Unit, Marcel was the comrade and childhood friend of Reiner Braun, Bertolt Hoover, Annie Leonhart and Pieck. At some point in his youth, his parents sent him and his younger brother Porco into training to become Warriors, where he excelled during his training and was nominated to inherit the power of the Jaw Titan. When the time came for the Warrior candidates to receive their Titans, Marcel began to worry for his brother Porco's life, and in order to keep Porco alive, secretly lobbied to his Marleyan superiors to have Reiner Braun (who was an underperformer) given the power of the Armored Titan instead. When Marley officially began the Paradis Island Operation in the year 845, Marcel was chosen along with Reiner, Bertolt and Annie to infiltrate the Walls of Paradis and capture the Founding Titan. After landing on Paradis and traveling through the night, the four Warriors camp until sunrise. At this time, Marcel reveals to Reiner his doings and apologizes for putting his brother's life over Reiner. But the group are attacked by the Pure Titan that Ymir became, Marcel pushing Reiner out of harm's way and ends up being devoured by Ymir who acquires the Jaw Titan from him. : Marcel is voiced by Masamichi Kitada in the Japanese anime. In the English dub, he is voiced by Nathan Sharp. ; : An Eldian cadet of the Marleyan Warrior Unit, Porco is the current holder of the Jaws Titan and the younger brother of Marcel Galliard, who previous held the Jaws Titan before being devoured by Ymir's Pure Titan. Galliard later acquired his power by devouring Ymir after she volunteerily surrendered herself to Marley via Reiner and Berholt. Having bullied Reiner during their Warrior cadet days, Porco bore a bitter grudge against him for getting his elder brother killed. After sustaining numerous injuries to the point of Porco being unable to heal himself, Porco learns the truth of his brother's sacrifice and sacrifices himself to save Reiner from Falco Grice, who acquires the Jaw Titan from him. ; : An Eldian cadet of the Marleyan Warrior Unit, Pieck is known for her intelligence and perceptiveness, and is able to transform into the Cart Titan to transport massive amounts of cargo on her back, as she did during the battle against the Survey Corps in Shiganshina, supplying Zeke with barrels and boulders for throwing. During the battle at Fort Slava, she acted as a heavily armoured tank by protecting her face with a large, plated mask while carrying two soldiers armed with machine guns.

In her childhood, she was discriminated and heavily spiited on by Marleyans, which made her become painful and be zealous to become the greatest hero just like her beloved paternal cousin brother Reiner. She has a heart of bravery and invincible fearlessness to the extent of throwing bombs directly at the on the rail of thet Mideast Union. During the Battle of Liberio, After breaking out of prison, Gabi is taken in by Kaya and the Blouse family, beginning to doubt her previous hatred towards the Eldians within the Walls. She later fully renounces her hatred, and attempts to stop the rumbling alongside the Survey Corps and other warriors. ; : A timid, kind-hearted Warrior candidate and nephew of the condemned Eldian Restorationist member Grice, competing with Gabi (whom he also has a crush on) to inherit the power of the Armored Titan.

After the Marley Mid-East War ended, Falco befriends a one-legged veteran who is actually a disguised Eren who used him to set up a meeting with Reiner in Liberio. After the Battle of Liberio, Falco ends up in Paradis with Gabi after stowing away onto the Survey Corps evacuation airship with her.

Tybur Family The is a house of elite and influential Eldian nobles living in Marley as honorary Marleyans, although they are actually Marley's true ruler. Even though they are Eldian, they are highly respected throughout the world for being the first Eldian family to fight against their own king during the Great Titan War. They gave Marley freedom and power as an act of atonement for their ancestors' crimes against the Marleyans. They held the power of the for generations, but only a select few knew of the inheritor's identity. ; : The patriarch of the Tybur family and the true ruler of Marley, Willy's ancestors orchestrated the downfall of the Eldian Empire with King Karl Fritz ages ago. While a pacifist, Willy shares his family's disdain towards Fritz's methods in the segregation of the Eldians from Paradis island. While publicly revealing his family's true history and indifference to Marley's decline, Willy express full intentions of seizing the resources of Paradis Island. Claiming to have inherited the power of the War Hammer Titan that was kept in his bloodline for years, Willy shared his family's preference of using its power for the sake of maintaining peace. After publicly declaring war on Paradis, Willy was killed and eaten by a transformed Eren, who then proceeded to attack Marley's leadership in the audience, but Willy's younger sister is later revealed to be the true holder of the War Hammer Titan. ; : The unnamed sister of Willy Tybur. She is the true head of the Tybur House and the holder of the War Hammer Titan. She fought with Eren's Attack Titan formwhere they are equal in power. When the Attack Titan found out where the crystallized form of Ms. Tybur is, he heads there and is intercepted by the Jaw Titan and the Cartman Titan. This gave Ms. Tybur time to form a new War Hammer Titan body who uses its spikes to stab the Attack Titan. Though she is unable to pierce the nape of the Attack Titan. When Eren states that the War Hammer Titan is out of moves, he abandons the Attack Titan body and forms a new one where he picks up Ms. Tybur's crystal. While noting the damages to the crystal surrounding her, Ms. Tybur watches the battle between the Attack Titan and the Jaw Titan. After the Attack Titan subdues the Jaw Titan and uses its jaws to break open the crystal, its destruction rips Ms. Tybur to shreds as the Attack Titan eats her remains. Other inhabitants ; : The father of Grisha and Faye Yeager and the paternal grandfather of Zeke and Eren Yeager, he was also the guardian of Zeke after Grisha was arrested. He works as a respected doctor in the Liberio Internment Zone. ; : The mother of Grisha and Faye Yeager and the paternal grandmother of Zeke and Eren Yeager, she was also the guardian of Zeke after Grisha was arrested. ; : Faye is the younger sister of Grisha Yeager, and the paternal aunt of Zeke and Eren. She was brutally murdered at the age of 8 when the Marleyan Public Security Authority officer Gross casually had his sons' dogs maul her and dumped the mutilated remains of her body near the river. The truth of her death was what later motivated Grisha to join the Eldia Restoration movement. ; : Tom Xaver is an Eldian researcher from the Titan Biology Research Society and later a Warrior who held the power of the Beast Titan, and the childhood mentor and friend of Zeke Yeager. In his early adulthood, Tom Xaver lived as a resident of the Liberio Internment Zone, and at some point fell in love with a Marleyan woman. Knowing that it is forbidden for Eldians and Marleyans to marry, he purposefully hid his Eldian armband and the two soon got married. Several years after Xaver's wife gave birth to their son, she discovered his Eldian heritage and promptly killed both herself and their son in shame. Xaver was overcome with grief and later become a Warrior as a form of suicide. He somehow eventually inherited one of the Nine Titans, the Beast Titan, and also became a researcher in order to study the Titan powers. : Roughly halfway through his Titan tenure, Xaver began observing the new batch of Warrior candidates and took particular interest a boy who was lagging behind — Zeke Yeager. Despite the boy's poor performance, Xaver encourages the him and formed a bond through playing catch. When one day Zeke revealed that his parents were leaders of the Eldian Restorationists movement, knowing that the Marleyan authorities was close to cracking the identities of the cell's leaders, Xaver suggested that Zeke turn in his parents in order to prove his loyalty to Marley and save his grandparents, and was consoling Zeke when Grisha and Dina were detained by the Public Security Authorities. He later revealed to Zeke his discovery that the Founding Titan was capable of changing the very body composition of Eldians. When Zeke suggested using Founding Titan power to sterilize all Eldians and free the race of the Titan curse via eradication, Xaver tearfully wondered how much better it would have been if he was never born into this world. Zeke then promised Xaver that he would inherit his Beast Titan and use it to seize the Founding Titan and free the world from the fear of the Titans. In 842, Xaver is consumed and passed on the Beast Titan to Zeke. ; : Gross is a Marleyan in the Public Security Authorities who expresses delight in killing Eldians, partnered with Eren Kruger. While Kruger physically disciplines Grisha when he and his sister were found wandering outside the Liberio Internment Zone, Gross took Faye away and covered up that he sadistically fed the girl to his son's dogs after her remains were found in the river the following day. : Fifteen years later, Grisha would encounter Gross when he was among the officers overseeing the Eldian Restorationists' sentence to exile on Paradis. During the process, turning Dina and most into Pure Titans while simply kicking others like Grice off the wall to be devoured by their transformed comrades, Gross confesses that he did murdered Faye for both fun and to help his sons build character. Gross was about feed Grisha to the last of the Restorationists he turned into Titan, only to be killed instead when Kruger pushes him off the wall. ; : Niccolo is a Marleyan conscript who served on Marleyan Navy and was part of the first survey fleet to Paradis following the Warriors' failed mission. As a member of advanced party, Niccolo landed on Paradis ahead of the main Marleyan vessel and is immediately captured by the Survey Corps. However, Yelena reveals him be a master chef of Marleyan cuisine and he is made to cook seafood for those working on the port. He is surprised by Sasha Blouse's impassioned reaction to his food, and eventually grow closer to Sasha to the point that Kaya believes they are dating.  Eldian Restorationists  The were a radical group of rebellious Eldians in Liberio who were deeply resentful of Marley's cruel treatments and pledged to overthrow Marley and restore Eldia as a world power. The initial Restorationist movement were organized by remnants of the Fritz royal family that stayed in Marley. A revolutionary army was formed, but the uprising was unsuccessful and crushed. All members of this original organization were hunted down by the Marleyan Public Security Authority and brutally executed for treason. The latest organization was formed by an anonymous sleeper agent hidden inside the Marleyan Public Security Authority nicknamed , who supplied weapons, funds and historical documents to the Restorationists. The members identified their allegiance with a self-inflicted cross-shaped scar on the body. By looking at illustrations written in an ancient language nobody can read, they rejected Marley's vilified version of Eldian history and believed it to be lying propagandas, and concluded that Ymir Fritz was a goddess who used the power of the Titans to cultivate lands, build roads, bridging mountains and bring prosperity to mankind. Grisha Yeager joined the Restorationists in year 824 at the age of 18, after being informed of the truth of his sister's murder. He quickly raised in rank within the organization, and later married Dina Fritz, the last surviving royal descendant in Marley. When the Marley government proclaimed the Warrior program, Grisha planned to make his son Zeke enlist as a Warrior cadet and serve as a sleeper agent so the Restorationists can acquire the Founding Titan from Paradis. However, Zeke snitched his parents to the Marleyan authorities and all the Restorationists members were arrested, tortured and exile to Paradis as Pure Titans. ; : An Eldian spy posing as a Marleyan Public Security officer. Eren Kruger's father had joined an Eldian revolutionary army led by the remnants of the royal Fritz family who remained on the mainland. Unfortunately the army was very ineffective and was defeated, and its members were captured. Kruger's parents was burned alive by the Marleyan Public Security Authorities as the young Kruger hid in a closet and watched in horror until he was rescued by his father's friends. Some years later, Kruger was able to join the Public Security Authorities thanks to faked blood tests by an Eldian doctor who had faked his own tests sometime earlier. As a spy in the military, Kruger would refer to himself in correspondence with the newly reorganized Eldian Restorationists as \\"the Owl\\", all while spending his military career torturing and turning thousands of Eldians into Titans over the years in order to hide his identity. : Kruger first met Grisha Yeager when the latter was a teenager venturing outside Liberio without exit permits to watch an airship landing with his sister. Despite knowing that Grisha's sister was killed by the police, Kruger pretended to not know anything to protect his cover. Since then he developed sympathy for him, having arranged his meeting with Dina while concealing her lineage from the Marleyan government. When Grisha was sentenced to roam the lands of Paradis as an exile mindless Titan, Kruger rescues him at the last second by kicking Sergeant Major Gross off the wall, revealing not only his disguise, but the fact that he also possesses the one of the Nine Titans, the . Kruger explains his life is nearing its end and names Grisha his successor, then injects Grisha with Titan serum and allows himself to be eaten. Grisha would pass that same power years later to his son Eren, whom is apparently named after Kruger and later uses it as an alias to infiltrate Marley under disguise. ; : Grisha Yeager's first wife and Zeke's mother, and the last surviving member of the continental royal family after the failed uprising. Hiding her royal background, Dina joined the Eldian Restorationists at the behest of Eren Kruger, resulting in her meeting and later marrying Grisha. When the Marleyan government began establishing the Warrior program, Dina and Grisha sent their 7-year-old son Zeke as a recruit as he can be sent to Paradis and obtain the Founding Titan for their cause. But Zeke, after learning the Public Security Authority are already onto their parents, chooses to turn in his parents and their co- conspirators to save his grandparents. Kruger, working as a sleeper agent within the Public Security, made sure Dina's lineage did not get revealed while being tortured and exiled to Paradis, to keep her from being exploited by Marley as a broodmare. On the seawall of Paradis, a battered Dina farewelled her husband with the promise that she will always find him, before being injected with Titan serum and kicked off the wall, transforming into a large Pure Titan with a menacing grin. : Thirteen years later during the fall of Wall Maria, Dina invaded Shiganshina with the other Titans, headed straight to Grisha's house and instinctively devoured his second wife Carla, becoming the cause of young Eren's intense hatred towards all Titans. She appeared again five years later during the chaotic battle between the Survey Corps and the Armored Titan, devouring Garrison veteran Hannes, who was protecting Eren and an injured Mikasa while attempting to avenge Carla. When Eren couldn't transform and all hope seemed lost, he desperately threw a punch and hit Dina's hand as she reached to grab him. This unintentional physical contact triggered the dormant Coordinate power within Eren, and caused the surrounding Pure Titans to attack Dina and tear her into pieces. It was only later that Eren learns from Grisha's memoir books of Dina's existence as a human, realizing that being in direct contact with a Fritz descendant was what enabled him to use the Founding Titan. ; : A member of the Eldian Restorationists who played a role in Grisha's induction into the group after informing him of the nature of Faye's fate. He is also the uncle of the Warrior candidates Colt and Falco. When the Restorationists were apprehended by Zeke, Grice expresses regret meeting Grisha as he was kicked into Paradis and presumed to have been killed by his transformed comrades.  Anti- Marleyan Volunteers  The are a group of underground rebel soldiers serving within the Marleyan Army, membership is largely composed of people from countries that Marley conquered in its aggressive territorial expansion. Holding a severe grudge after being conscripted to fight for the country that oppressed them, the Volunteers aspire to throw overthrow the Marleyan government for their freein. They initially had very little success before they morale was renewed when they allied themselves with Zeke Yeager. During the early stages of the Marley Mid-East War, the Volunteers betray Marley's first survey fleet sent to Paradis Island to set up Zeke's covert alliance with the Eldians in providing the country with technology and intel in return to receive amnesty for Zeke and his followers. The Volunteers would continue aiding the Survey Corps, playing a crucial role in the Battle of Liberio, including infiltrating the Marleyan ranks to incapacitate Marleyan Warriors and piloting an airship to ensure the Survey Corps' safe retreat. After returning to Paradis, the Volunteers turn over to the Garrison Corps a stock of Titan serums they managed to steal from Marley, but Dot Pixis has them arrested as he explained that Paradis is not yet to fully trust Zeke and his followers. ; : A very tall blonde woman who is a fanatic follower of Zeke Yeager, serving as his lieutenant and de facto deputy leader of the Volunteers. Yelena has been shown to be somewhat deranged in her zealotry, and would summarily execute any of her comrades suspected to be against their goals. In the year 851, learning that Zeke's half-brother Eren Yeager possesses two Titan abilities, Yelena volunteers to go to Paradis Island as part of a Marleyan survey crew. Killing her commander when he refuses to surrender after their vessel is beached and captured by Eren, Yelena explains her faction to Hange and Levi while revealing that Marley's war in the Middle East is preventing it from launching another assault on Paradis Island. Forming an alliance with Paradis, Yelena and her comrades begin sharing their technology with the islanders while later arranging a meeting between Paradis and Hizuru to discuss a strategic alliance. Three years later, posing as a male Marleyan soldier from the Lakura military base, Yelena is among the Paradis forces sent to Liberio to retrieve Eren while luring Pieck and Galliard into a trap to remove them from intervening in Survey Corps attack. As the Battle of Liberio ends, Yelena and her fellow Volunteers turn over a stock of Titan serums they managed to steal from Marley to the Garrison, but is arrested by Dot Pixis, who is not yet willing to trust Zeke and his followers. After being in confinement, Yelena is interrogated by Pixis, who acknowledges that Eldia is in the Volunteers' debt and reveals his suspicions that Yelena has been secretly conspiring with Eren through Floch Forster. ; : A dark-skinned man who is seemingly friendly but has a rather serious mindset. Onyankopon is among the first Marleyan survey fleet sent in 851 to Paradis, and helps his fellow Volunteers member Yelena in disarming their commanding officers when his ship is captured and beached by Eren Yeager. Forming an alliance with Paradis Island, Onyankopon and his comrades begin sharing technology with the islanders, with Onyankopon focusing on ways to strategically prepare Paradis Island for reintegration with the outside world, such as building ports for ships to dock. During the Survey Corps' attack of Liberio in 854, Onyankopon serves as an airship pilot to pick up retreating soldiers. After being arrested by Dot Pixis on the account of distrust, Onyankopon makes no effort to conceal his dismay at the Paradis military for imprisoning the Volunteers, reminding the visiting Hange of all that the two accomplished while working together over the past three years. He later accompanies Hange to a hearing regarding the rebellion by Eren's supporters. Others ; : An ambassador from the nation of and the matriarch of the , a descendant of the former ruling . She first appeared as a diplomat attending the party the night before Willy Tybur's stage presentation in Liberio, and appears to be friendly to ethnic Eldians when she covers for Udo, one of the Warrior cadets, when he accidentally spills wine on her kimono. The following day, she visits Willy in the backstage area and passes off her visit as simply wanting to see his face and tells him that she hopes he fulfills his duty without incident. However, she leaves with her escort soon after, instead of staying to watch the stage production (which is later attacked by Eren and the Survey Corps). : It is later revealed that years ago Kiyomi secretly met with Zeke Yeager, who offered to conspire with her to restore Eldia which would benefit Hizuru as it struggled diplomatically after the Great Titan War due to the nation's historical alliance with Eldia. Kiyomi later visited Paradis with a diplomatic delegation from Hizuru to rekindle the alliance, revealing Mikasa Ackerman's mother to be a descendant of an Azumabito cadet branch that migrated to Paradis. Kiyomi explains her arrangement with Zeke to the Paradis military, offering to help modernize Paradis in return for Historia to inherit Zeke's Titan powers.

D. G. Armstrong, ‘Blaxter, Sir Kenneth Lyon (1919–1991)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Sept 2012 accessed 15 May 2013  Biography   Early life  Blaxter was born on 19 June 1919 in Sprowston, England and grew up in Norfolk. His father made handicrafts and his mother came from a family of farm workers. Blaxter studied at the City of Norwich School until 1936. He was bored in school and received poor grades. As a teenager, Blaxter spent his spare time at the Norfolk Agricultural Station, a short distance from the family home. Soon after, he enrolled in day classes in agriculture at the Norfolk County Council, winning the class prize for the highest mark. He also worked as a farmhand on a farm in Hoveton. Blaxter studied agriculture, biology and botany at the University of Reading in 1936, graduating in 1939.  Nutrition research  After graduating, Blaxter worked at the National Institute for Research in Dairying (NIRD), located in Shinfield. With the onset of World War II, Blaxter was conscripted and served with the 10th Field Regiment of the Royal Artillery from spring 1940 to the end of 1941, when he returned to NIRD. At this time, he began to write his Ph.D thesis, entitled The maintenance of the winter milk supply in wartime; he completed the thesis in 1944. Shortly thereafter, he requested to be seconded to the biochemistry department of the Ministry of Agriculture in Weybridge, where he conducted blood analysis and researched lead toxicity in ruminants. In 1946, Blaxter moved to Illinois to work with animal nutritionist Harold Mitchell at the University of Illinois.  Work as an independent scientist  In 1947, after returning to England, Blaxter applied for the headship of the Nutrition Department at the Hannah Dairy Research Institute in Ayr, Scotland and received the position in 1948. During his tenure at the Hannah Dairy Research Institute, Blaxter wrote over 200 papers, focusing primarily on the issues of energy metabolism and feed usage by ruminants. Blaxter also investigated nutritional diseases and magnesium deficiency in calves, the effect of temperature and other environmental effects on sheep, and ruminant digestion and feed intake. In 1965, Blaxter was appointed director of the Rowett Research Institute in Aberdeen, Scotland. There, Blaxter and his team of researchers studied topics of importance to the Scottish farmer, including deer farming, llamas, human nutrition, feed evaluation, environmental stress and animal calorimetry. He also took an interest in agriculture and worldwide food policy, culminating in the publication of a book, Food, People and Resources, in 1986.  Retirement  Blaxter retired from the Rowett Research Institute in 1982. From 1985 to 1991, Blaxter was a visiting professor in the University of Newcastle upon Tyne's Department of Agricultural Biochemistry and Nutrition. He also chaired a committee of the federal Department of the Environment and the Cabinet Committee on Individual Merit Promotion, a body that recognized and awarded candidates from various scientific fields. He died on 18 April 1991 of a brain tumour.  Honours and awards  Blaxter was named a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1967 and was knighted in 1977. From 1972 to 1975, he served as vice-president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and acted as its president from 1979 to 1982. He also served a three-year term in the 1980s as President of the Institute of Biology. In 1979, he received the Wolf Prize in Agriculture for his research into the nutritional requirements of ruminants. In 1992, he was posthumously awarded the Rank Prize in Nutrition for his lifetime contributions to nutrition science. Blaxter was also the recipient of honorary doctorates from Queen's University in Belfast, the Agricultural University in Norway, the University of Leeds, the University of Aberdeen and the University of Newcastle.  Personal life  Blaxter married sociologist Mildred Hall in 1957; they had three children together. Blaxter's cousin was Mary Lyon, the well-known British geneticist. Blaxter was also an avid amateur painter.  Legacy  Blaxter was influential in the fields of animal and human nutrition and animal husbandry. In Blaxter's memory, the British Society of Animal Science grants an annual scholarship, entitled the Kenneth Blaxter Award, to a deserving member of the Society in order to pursue short-term research in the animal sciences.

The first racing in Wye took place on 29 May 1849 at the Crown. Originally, racing took place over fences and on the flat, but in 1878 the course moved to Harville Farm and flat racing ceased. Steeplechases, however, continued to be held in September, January, March, and May. The last racing took place at Wye on 2 May 1974 and the course closed permanently in June 1975. The Jockey Club had insisted upon changes to the course in August 1974, including changing the camber of the bottom turn and improving the grandstand. However, the owners were unable to fund these changes, leading to closure. Wye was a very small, oval track, less than 1 mile (1.6 km) round. The land is now farmed, although some evidence of the racecourse can still be seen from satellite photographs.

CPM United Kingdom Ltd.Intel Corp. v. CPM United Kingdom, C-252/07, [2009] E.T.M.R. 13 (full name Intel Corporation Inc. v. CPM United Kingdom Ltd.), Case 252/2007 was a case of the European Court of Justice in which the ECJ interpreted the meaning of Article 4 (4)(a) of the EU Trade Marks Directive. The ECJ considered what elements are required to show that a later mark was causing dilution to an earlier mark. The case laid out a clear basis on which grounds a court can find that trademark dilution has occurred.  Background  Intel Corp., a company that produces microprocessors had a UK national trademark, as well as various trademarks in other countries, and an EU-wide community trademark consisting of, or including the word 'INTEL'. CPM United Kingdom had the UK national trademark registration for the word 'INTELMARK' to brand their telemarketing services. Intel claimed that CPM's use of the mark would take unfair advantage of, or be detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the earlier 'INTEL' mark the Trade Marks Act 1994.Ibid, § 12(The Trade Marks Act is the UK adoption of the EU Trade Marks Directive). Intel brought an action against CPM with the UK Trade Mark Registry, and a Hearing Officer denied the claim on 1 February 2006. Intel appealed the case to the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, and they dismissed the complaint on 26 July 2006. Intel then appealed the decision to the Court of Appeal which then decided that there was a question of European Law and stayed the proceedings while confirming the question about dilution to the ECJ.  Opinion  The Court determined that Article 4(4)(a) of the Directive ensures protection for trade marks with a reputation by protecting the mark from damage to its distinctive character, or to its reputation, and it prohibits the subsequent mark from taking unfair advantage of the distinctiveness or repute of the earlier mark. The Court concluded that it should interpret Article 4(4)(a) in the same way that it interpreted Article 5(2) in an earlier ruling as the wording of these articles are designed to give trademarks with a reputation the same protection. The Court determined that under the Adidas-Salomon and Adidas BeneluxIbid, § 30 (citing Adidas-Salomon and Adidas Benelux v. Fitnessworld Training LTd. C-408/01) ruling a plaintiff must establish that a link between the marks exists in the minds of the relevant public. The Court further goes on to state that while the establishment of the link is a requirement to show dilution, the presence of the link itself is not sufficient to establish that one of the three types of injury had occurred. In answering the questions posed by the Court of Appeal regarding the link the ECJ found that a court determining whether there exists such a link must look at all relevant factors and undertake a global analysis. Factors that the court considered relevant include: 1) the degree of similarity between the marks, 2) the nature of the goods or services for which the marks are registered, and the degree of similarity between those categories and the relevant consumers, 3) the strength of the earlier mark's reputation, 4) the degree of the earlier mark's distinctive character, and 5) the existence of the likelihood of confusion. The Court found that the relevant public should be the consumers of the product of the prior mark if the plaintiff alleges injury to the reputation or distinctive character of the prior mark. If the plaintiff claims that the later mark is gaining an unfair advantage then the relevant public to be considered is the consumers of the good identified by the subsequent mark. The Court next looked at what a court should consider to determine whether there was an injury. The Court concluded that to show injury by harm to the distinctive character of the mark or to its reputation, a plaintiff has to show that there was a change in the economic behaviour of the average consumer of the goods for which the prior mark was registered. Likewise if a plaintiff wants to show that injury occurred due to the latter marks gaining of an unjust advantage it would have to be shown that use of the subsequent mark caused a change in the economic behaviour of the average consumer of the goods for which the subsequent mark was registered. The Court determined that the group whose economic behaviour changes must be analogous to the group considered to be the relevant public of the marks. Lastly the Court concluded that the change in economic behaviour must not be actual, but a subsequent mark should also be denied if it can be shown that there is a high likelihood of future harm to the prior mark.  Judgment  The Court concluded that the fact that an earlier mark had a significant reputation, the categories of goods for which the marks were registered were dissimilar, and that the earlier mark was unique, is insufficient as to assume that there is a link between the marks under Adidas-Salomon and Adidas Benelux' That to show injury to the prior mark all relevant factors should be considered. Just because the earlier mark has a reputation, the goods are dissimilar, the prior mark is unique, and that the later mark calls the prior one to mind, is insufficient to show that the later mark causes injury. Lastly injury can be shown even if the prior mark is not unique. First use of the subsequent mark may cause injury and so likelihood of future harm is sufficient proof, and that evidence of injury requires proof of a change in economic behaviour of the relevant consumers.  Commentary  It has been said that the approach taken by the ECJ in determining dilution adds increased complexity to the subject and makes it more difficult to determine as the Court added the test for a link, and the analysis of economic behaviour. However they also feel that the ECJ approach may be easier to apply in practice than the more nebulous and undefined concepts of detriment and unfair advantage, and so if realised properly the ECJ could be an advantage to trademark holders.Ibid  See also  *European Union law *Trade Marks Directive *European Court of Justice  Notes   References  * * *  External links  * Case 252/07, Intel Corporation v.

A 6'6\\" swingman, he was named the 2012–13 Big South Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year while playing for Virginia Military Institute (VMI). High school career Okoye, a native of Raleigh, North Carolina, attended Knightdale High School from 2005–06 through 2008–09. During his four-year varsity career he scored over 1,300 points and grabbed over 550 rebounds, both of which are school records. Okoye also scored a single game record 42 points during a Class 4A playoff game. Knightdale won 73 games during his tenure. Despite this production on the court, only two NCAA Division I schools offered him basketball scholarships – Campbell University and VMI. Campbell later rescinded their offer, however, leaving Okoye with VMI as his only Division I opportunity, which he then accepted. College career Okoye enrolled in fall 2009 at VMI to play for the Keydets. He had initial struggles coping with college life, especially at a military school where upperclassmen put mental and physical pressures on freshmen. At one point he contemplated dropping out before having played in a single college basketball game, but Okoye stuck with it because of support from his teammates. He said, \\"I stuck it out because of the other guys. I figured if they could take it, I could too.\\" In 2009–10, Okoye led all Big South Conference freshmen in scoring and field goal percentage in overall games. In conference games, he led all freshmen in scoring, field goal percentage and blocks. For the season he averaged 14.2 points, 6.6 rebounds and 1.5 blocks per game and was named to the Big South All-Freshman Team. As a sophomore in 2010–11, Okoye improved his averages in points, rebounds, assists and steals per game. His blocks per game dipped slightly from his freshman season, however. Okoye finished his second year with 933 career points. Okoye followed a sophomore year with a junior season that saw him claim a Second Team All-Conference selection. In Big South games he averaged 19.5 points and 8.2 rebounds per game, which were second and fourth, respectively, within the league. He led the Keydets to the Big South Tournament championship game, but they lost to UNC Asheville 80 to 64. Okoye had a breakout senior season in 2012–13 in which he averaged 21.5 points, 9.4 rebounds and 2.6 assists per game. He was named the preseason conference player of the year, an honor he would then garner at the conclusion of the season as well. His scoring and rebounding averages led the Big South and was named its Player of the Week five times throughout the season. VMI lost to Charleston Southern in the conference tournament, thus ending VMI's hopes of a postseason tournament bid. Okoye finished his collegiate career with 2,146 points, 962 rebounds, 212 assists, 152 steals and 103 blocks. Professional career On August 13, 2013, Okoye signed with Ikaros for the 2013–14 Greek Basket League season. He left Ikaros before playing in a game for them, and on October 27, 2013, he signed with Barak Netanya of Israel for the rest of the season. In November 2013, he left Netanya after appearing in just four games. On February 6, 2014, Okoye signed with the Perth Redbacks for the 2014 State Basketball League season. He made his debut for the Redbacks in the team's season opener on March 14, recording 30 points, 13 rebounds, 3 assists and 3 steals in a 96–93 win over the Rockingham Flames. On May 15, he was named the SBL Player of the Week for Round 9. He appeared in all 30 games for the Redbacks in 2014, averaging 28.0 points, 11.2 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 1.8 steals and 1.0 blocks per game. On August 16, 2014, Okoye signed with Pallacanestro Varese for the 2014–15 Lega Basket Serie A season. In 23 games for Varese, he averaged 5.4 points and 3.9 rebounds per game. On August 17, 2015, Okoye signed with Bawer Matera of the Serie A2 Basket.Bawer Matera signs Stan Okoye In February 2016, he left Matera and signed with Pallacanestro Trapani for the rest of the season.Welcome Stanley Okoye!

Her love interest is a policeman. While Súper Cholita uses her powers to help the poor, her behavior is not always as exemplary as that of most superheroes.

History The D class locomotive was built in 1884 by Hunslet Engine Company, Leeds. It entered service on 1 March 1884 as a jetty shunter on the Fremantle Long Jetty. When engine class designations were introduced in 1885, it was numbered D6. Upon the opening of Fremantle's inner harbour in 1897, the long jetty ceased to be used, and the locomotive became surplus to requirements. It was sold in September 1903 for use on the 2.5 mile Leonora tramway. Following the electrification of that tramway in 1908, it was sold to Bunning Brothers, reboilered, had its saddle tank removed and a tender built hauled timber hauling times trains at Lyall Mill, Argyle, Muja and Tullis until withdrawn in 1951 and scrapped in 1956.

George Zimmerman was a criminal prosecution of George Zimmerman on the charge of second-degree murder stemming from the shooting of Trayvon Martin on February 26, 2012. On April 11, 2012, George Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. In support of the charges, the State filed an affidavit of probable cause, stating that Zimmerman profiled and confronted Martin and shot him to death while Martin was committing no crimes. Florida State Attorney Angela Corey announced the charges against Zimmerman during a televised press conference and reported that Zimmerman was in custody after turning himself in to law enforcement. Zimmerman was injured during the encounter and said he shot Martin in self-defense.Zimmerman Is Acquitted in Trayvon Martin Killing - NY Times After sixteen hours of deliberations over the course of two days, on July 13, 2013, the six-person jury rendered a not guilty verdict on all counts.Zimmerman jury reaches a verdict - Yamiche Alcindor, USA TODAY - July 13, 2013. Retrieved July 14, 2013. Prosecution attorneys State Attorney Angela Corey On March 22, 2012, Florida Governor Rick Scott announced his appointment of Angela Corey as the Special Prosecutor in the Martin investigation. She is the State Attorney for Duval, Clay and Nassau counties. When Corey took the case, she chose Bernie de la Rionda as lead prosecutor. De la Rionda was an Assistant State Attorney in Corey's office and had been a prosecutor for 29 years. Prosecutors John Guy and Richard Mantei assisted, with Guy making the opening statement. The prosecutor initially responsible for the case was Norm Wolfinger, a State Attorney whose jurisdiction included Seminole County where the shooting occurred on February 26, 2012. On March 22, 2012, he requested to be removed from the case to help \\"tone down the rhetoric\\" for the public good. Defense attorneys On April 11, 2012, Mark M. O'Mara announced that he was the attorney representing Zimmerman. O'Mara is president of the Seminole County Bar Association, is a legal commentator for WKMG news, and had previously tried cases that involved the Stand-your-ground law. When he took the case, O'Mara said that Zimmerman had no money and that the state may help pay the costs. When reporters asked why he took the case, O'Mara said, \\"That's what I do.\\" On May 31, 2012, Orlando attorney Don West left his job as a federal public defender to join the defense team led by O'Mara. West specialized in murder cases and had been a board certified criminal trial specialist for 25 years. He and O'Mara had been friends for a long time. In September 2013, O'Mara announced he had signed on to be a legal analyst for CNN. Judges Judge Debra S. Nelson of the 18th Circuit Court of Florida was the fourth judge to preside over the case. Nelson had been a judge for thirteen years, much of it handling criminal matters. Before becoming a judge she had worked in civil litigation. Nelson succeeded Judge Kenneth Lester on August 30, 2012, after a Florida appeals court ruled that remarks he made about Zimmerman could make a reasonable person believe Lester was biased against Zimmerman. Lester had taken over the case in April 2012, after Judge Jessica Recksiedler recused herself due to a potential conflict of interest involving her husband's work. Pre-trial At a pretrial hearing on April 12, Judge Mark Herr ruled that the affidavit was legally sufficient to establish probable cause. Court documents, including witness statements and other information, were sealed at the request of the defense team, and Zimmerman's arraignment was scheduled for May 29. Zimmerman took the witness stand at a bail hearing on April 20 and told the parents of Martin he was \\"sorry for the loss of your son\\". Zimmerman was released on a $150,000 bond and was fitted with an electronic monitoring device for monitoring his whereabouts in real- time. Zimmerman's attorney waived Zimmerman's right to appear at the arraignment and entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. ;Zimmerman's bond revocation In June 2012, Judge Lester revoked Zimmerman's bond and sent him back to jail after the prosecution alleged that Zimmerman and his wife had misled the court about their finances at an earlier bond hearing. Zimmerman's wife had testified at the hearing that they had very little money, and neither she nor Zimmerman revealed to the court that he had received $135,000 in donations. The prosecution alleged that recordings of telephone conversations Zimmerman had had with his wife from jail showed that they had been speaking using a code about their finances, with repeated mentions of \\"Peter Pan\\" in apparent reference to a PayPal account. The judge charged Zimmerman's wife with perjury, and at a second bond hearing for Zimmerman held the following month, re-released Zimmerman with the new bond set at $1 million.Mike Schneider, \\"George Zimmerman Bail: Judge Sets Trayvon Martin Shooter's Bond At $1 Million\\", Associated Press, July 5, 2012. ;Removal of Judge Lester & assignment of Judge Nelson Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, filed a motion to disqualify Judge Lester, alleging that Lester had made disparaging and gratuitous remarks about his client in the July 2012 bond order. O'Mara said the judge's statement that he believed Zimmerman had misled the court at his first hearing was an indication of bias against Zimmerman and would impact Zimmerman's ability to get a fair trial. The state criticized the motion for citing \\"facts that are inaccurate, misleading and/or incomplete\\". When Judge Lester refused to recuse himself and ruled that the defense's motion was legally insufficient, the defense appealed. On August 29, 2012, the Fifth District Court of Appeal granted the petition for a new judge for the trial. Circuit Judge Debra Nelson was assigned to the case. ;Defense plans for pretrial immunity hearing Under Florida law, the use of deadly force against an attacker is permissible in certain situations. The adoption of the Stand Your Ground law in 2005 modified the self-defense law so that a person who reasonably believes they must use deadly force to prevent serious injury to themself may lawfully do so without first attempting to retreat from an attacker; prosecution for using deadly force in such situations is prohibited. A defendant in a homicide case who claims to have acted in self-defense may petition the court to grant the defendant immunity from prosecution under these provisions of the law. Legal experts say that in a pretrial immunity hearing, the burden of proof is on the defendant to show from \\"a preponderance of the evidence\\" that they acted lawfully, whereas in a trial by jury the burden of proof is on the prosecution, who must show \\"beyond a reasonable doubt\\" (a much higher standard than required for establishing \\"a preponderance of the evidence\\") that the defendant acted unlawfully. On August 9, 2012, Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, announced that the defense team was planning to present their case to the judge at an immunity hearing before going to trial in order to request that the case be dismissed under the protection from prosecution provided for by the state's Stand Your Ground law. However, at a press conference held the following week, O'Mara said that \\"the facts don't seem to support a 'stand your ground' defense\\". He said that rather than seeking to have the charges dropped based on Stand Your Ground-law immunity, the defense team would ask at the pretrial hearing that the case be dismissed on the basis of immunity from prosecution provided for in traditional self-defense cases.Zimmerman lawyer pursuing traditional self- defense In April 2013, on the advice of his attorneys, Zimmerman waived his right to a pretrial immunity hearing, and the court began preparations for the case to be tried by a jury. O'Mara would later say, after the trial had concluded, that he had not relied during the trial on the Stand Your Ground provision of the law because Zimmerman had not had an option of retreating. O'Mara would also say that he ultimately had not sought a pretrial immunity hearing because his case for defense would have been revealed during the hearing to the prosecution, which would have put the defense team at a disadvantage had the immunity request been denied and the case proceeded to trial. ;Defense evidence discovery requests On October 19, Judge Nelson granted the defense's request for access to Martin's school records, cell phone records, and social media (such as Facebook and Twitter) posts. In her ruling, Nelson said that Zimmerman's attorneys needed to know whether Martin's school records and social media postings revealed any evidence that he had had violent tendencies. Martin's parents said the defense's request for school records and social media was a \\"fishing expedition\\" aimed at attacking their son and an attempt to assassinate his character. She also ruled that Zimmerman's medical records be provided to prosecutors. Nelson said she would review the medical records and decide whether anything should be withheld. The defense additionally requested from ABC News and reporter Matt Gutman all recordings, notes and correspondence related to Witness Number 8, Trayvon Martin's friend who said she was speaking with Martin by phone just before he was shot. O'Mara's motion stated the call lasted more than 26 minutes and the recording they received from the authorities was only 12 minutes, 44 seconds long. Discovery evidence In May 2012, the defense received the first round of discovery evidence: 67 compact discs, a list of witnesses that included 50 possible law enforcement officers, 28 officers from the Sanford Police Department, 28 civilian witnesses, members of Martin's family, two of Zimmerman's friends and his father, Robert Zimmerman. Also listed as potential prosecution witnesses were technicians in biological and DNA evidence, trace evidence, gunshot residue, fingerprints and firearms, two FBI agents, and two audio technicians who analyzed the emergency calls made during the confrontation to determine who was heard screaming in the background. Additional evidence released were audio and video recordings, photos, witness statements, forensic findings, Martin's autopsy report, evidence taken from Zimmerman after the shooting – his weapon, bullets, clothes, a DNA sample, medical records and his cell phone data. In June 2012, the prosecution released recordings of two 911 calls placed by Martin's father the morning after the shooting. In the calls, Mr. Martin expressed worry that his son had not returned home, and inquired about filing a missing person report. Additional discovery released was a report containing the results of Zimmerman's voice stress test, and Zimmerman's account of the events and written statements. The defense also released audio and video recordings of Zimmerman's police interviews and re-enactment following the shooting. In July 2012, evidence released included: FBI interviews with people involved in the case, including Sanford police officers, family, friends and associates of Zimmerman. Also released were photos of Martin's bloodied sweatshirt and hoodie with a single bullet hole and several phone calls made by Zimmerman to Sanford police to report suspicious activity in the six months leading up to his encounter with Martin. In August 2012, the State's 6th Supplemental Discovery included 76 pages containing the audio statement from witness 31, three photos taken by witness 13 at the scene showing the back of Zimmerman's head, a flashlight on the ground, the FDLE report with analyst's notes, emails from the Sanford Police Department, copies of Tracy Martin's 911 call reporting his son missing and Zimmerman's Seminole County Sheriff's Office Academy application. In September 2012, the DNA report on the gun used in the shooting was released with only Zimmerman's DNA being found on the gun, no trace of Martin's. On December 3, 2012, defense attorney Mark O'Mara stated that he was \\"frustrated\\" that in the original discovery, a grainy black-and- white photo of Zimmerman had been substituted for the original color photo of Zimmerman's bloody nose. Criminal attorney David Wohl said the submission of the copy \\"borders on prosecutorial misconduct\\". On July 11, 2013, Special Prosecutor Angela Corey fired Ben Kruidbos, the information technology director for the State Attorney's office, for alleged misconduct and violations of \\"numerous state attorney's office policies and procedures.\\" Kruidbos had alleged in a pre-trial hearing that the prosecutors had failed to provide full discovery to Zimmerman's defense team as required by law. Jury selection On May 28, 2013, Judge Nelson denied a defense motion to delay the trial for six weeks. She also declined the prosecution's request to implement a gag order to keep the lawyers from discussing the details of the case in the media. On June 10, jury selection began with 100 prospective jurors filling out questionnaires. 500 people received summonses, and the process for picking a jury was expected to take two weeks. At the request of the defense, the judge agreed to establish an anonymous jury, where the identity of the jury would be revealed to the prosecution and defense, but not released to the public or media. In the motion for the request, the defense said that \\"[jurors] may be subject to rebuke and possible retribution, should the verdict not comport with certain factions' desires in this matter.\\" In Florida, juries consist of six people; 12 jurors are required only for criminal trials involving capital cases, where the death penalty is applicable. Zimmerman's jury consisted of six members and four alternatives. The population of Seminole County is 10 percent African American, a percentage which may differ from the statistics of the 500-member pool of potential jurors. During the fourth day of jury selection, Judge Nelson announced that the jury would be sequestered during the trial, which was expected to take two to four weeks. On June 18, 2013, forty potential jurors made it past the initial screening process: 16 men and 24 women. The defense struck one potential juror, a female African American, as a \\"stealth juror\\" for failing to disclose that her pastor had advocated strongly on behalf of Trayvon Martin. The state attempted to strike one woman whose husband owns guns, and who said she may have difficulty sending someone to prison. They also attempted to strike a woman who asked why Martin was out at night. The judge denied the strikes and both women were part of the six person jury. The prosecution struck one potential juror who was black, a gun-owner who stated he watched Fox News.Mediaite: ‘A Fox News Watcher’: Ejection Of Black Zimmerman Juror Over Ideology Embarrasses Race-Obsessed Pundits, July 16, 2013 This particular prospective juror had been a defense favorite. On June 20, jury selection was completed. Six jurors and four alternates were selected. All six of the jurors were female, two of the alternate jurors were male and two female. Five of the jurors were white, one was of mixed black and Mestizo ancestry. All of the alternates were white, and of those, one of the male alternates was said to have been white Hispanic. The jury was sworn in, and all remaining potential jurors were dismissed. Admissibility of evidence Judge Nelson ruled that Martin's school records, history of marijuana use, fights, and photos and text from the teen's phone should not be mentioned during the trial. The judge did say that she might change her mind during the trial if the subjects become relevant. Zimmerman's attorneys had requested a Frye hearing regarding the admissibility of the testimony of the audio analysts, to determine if the methods used by them are generally accepted by the scientific community. At the time of the hearing, Florida used the Frye standard, but during the course of the case, Florida switched to the Daubert standard, effective July 1, 2013. The Daubert standard is a more modern standard that considers several factors (not just general acceptance in the scientific community) in determining admissibility of expert testimony. On June 22, Judge Nelson ruled that the audio experts would not be allowed to testify at Zimmerman's trial. The prosecution wanted to use voice experts that had been hired by lawyers and news organizations to analyze the 911 calls recorded during the confrontation to determine whether it was Martin or Zimmerman yelling for help. The experts arrived at mixed conclusions. The judge said in her ruling that, \\"There is no evidence to establish that their scientific techniques have been tested and found reliable.\\" Her ruling didn't prevent the 911 calls from being played at trial. On July 8, Judge Nelson ruled that the defense could tell the jury that Martin had a small amount of marijuana in his system at the time of his death. Assistant State Attorney John Guy argued that it was a backdoor attack on Martin's character, while defense attorney Don West argued that an expert will tell the jury that the amount was enough to create \\"some level of impairment\\". Although admissible, the defense ultimately did not present this information to the jury, and it was not put into evidence. Opening statements The prosecution made a thirty-minute opening statement. Prosecutor John Guy began by quoting remarks made by Zimmerman during the non-emergency call: \\"Fucking punks, these assholes always get away.\\" The prosecution's statement focused on the lack of evidence of bodily harm to both Zimmerman and Martin, and portrayed Zimmerman as a liar who would be contradicted by witnesses and evidence. Guy also compared Zimmerman's and Martin's physical size, and commented on how small Martin was. The prosecution said Zimmerman was a \\"wannabe cop\\" who had trained in martial arts, that he was looking for \\"people who didn't belong,\\" and that he profiled Martin as \\"someone about to commit a crime in his neighborhood.\\" Don West made a lengthy opening statement for the defense, beginning with a knock-knock joke about jury selection. West stated that \\"there are no monsters\\" in the case, but that Zimmerman shot Martin \\"after being viciously attacked.\\" West stated that Zimmerman was \\"sucker punched in the face, and had his head hammered against the ground.\\" West played Zimmerman's non-emergency phone call twice, and used several visual aids to show jurors the location of various events in the case and to outline a timeline of the phone calls and events. West asserted that Martin had plenty of time to go home during the phone calls, but decided to confront Zimmerman. West attempted to reconstruct the shooting, using witness statements, crime scene photographs, and a discussion of Zimmerman's injuries that used photos. West then described Zimmerman's actions after the incident, and summarized witness and police statements and observations about Zimmerman's appearance and behavior. After the recess, West continued, pointing out that the gunshot was at contact range for Martin's sweatshirt, but several inches away from Martin's body, and said this proved that Martin was on top at the moment of the shot, with his shirt hanging down.George Zimmerman Trial - Day 1 - Part 3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lvq6E2Re0Tw Retrieved September 10, 2016 Prosecution's case Prosecution's witnesses' testimony Chad Joseph, the 15-year-old son of Tracy Martin's girlfriend, was called by the state as the first witness and testified that he asked Martin to buy him Skittles. He did not go with Martin, because he was playing a PS3 game. Next, testimony came from Andrew Gaugh, who was the 7-Eleven clerk that sold Martin snacks. He said that Martin paid with cash, and he did not see anything suspicious about Martin's behavior. Ramona Rumph, from the Sheriff's communications office, testified regarding how time stamps are applied in 911 calls. Rumph testified that 911 calls are initially coded as \\"routine\\" but can be upgraded, and that multiple calls can be linked together. Rumph testified as to the times of the various witness 911 calls. She testified about details of Zimmerman's prior 911 and non-emergency calls. The state then played several of his previous 911 and non-emergency calls for the jury. After the calls were played on cross- examination O'Mara asked Rumph about the results of these calls, and she testified that some had resulted in contacts with suspects. She could not comment on if the number of calls Zimmerman made was unusual. Donald O'Brien, the HOA president, testified that Zimmerman and the neighborhood watch were not affiliated with the HOA. O'Brien said he felt that Zimmerman was the coordinator of the program because Zimmerman had taken the initiative to get the program started, and that the watch program had instructed participants not to follow suspects but call 911. He said he did not feel that the neighborhood needed a watch program. On cross-examination, he testified that the police did not do regular patrols of the area due to the lack of a written agreement between the HOA and the police department. O'Brian testified that construction workers in the neighborhood had followed a burglary suspect in the past, resulting in an arrest, and that he had sent out a congratulatory email. During several rounds of redirects he said \\"do not follow\\", as well as \\"follow at a safe distance\\". Raymond MacDonald, an executive from T-Mobile, testified as to how cell phone records for calls and text-messages are collected and stored. MacDonald testified that billing records round the length of call up to the next highest minute, but that other records break calls to the second. MacDonald testified that on Martin's phone records, after a disconnected call at 7:26, all future incoming calls listed on the page went to voicemail. The records that break to the second are only available for six months, so some records for the trial were rounded up to the minute. Greg McKinney, who works for the company that runs the Retreat's security cameras, testified as to why the cameras near the front gate were not working at the time of the incident, and that security camera clocks are off by as much as 18 minutes. =Police and investigator testimony= Sean Noffke, the dispatcher who was on the phone during Zimmerman's non-emergency call, testified regarding his own statements at that time. Noffke said that when he told Zimmerman \\"We don't need you to do that,\\" he was making a suggestion, not giving an order. He said that dispatchers do not give orders because of liability issues. During cross-examination, Noffke testified that Zimmerman did not seem angry during the call, and that he wanted the police to come to his location. Noffke also testified that he asked Zimmerman which way Martin was going, and that his question could be interpreted as a request to go and see which way he was going. He clarified his statement that dispatchers do not give orders, but suggestions for the safety of the caller. He testified that Zimmerman's swearing and comments about Martin did not raise any particular concern, but under redirect said that Zimmerman's language could be interpreted as \\"hostile.\\" The defense then asked if Noffke actually heard hostility, and he said \\"no\\". The defense asked about the statements regarding Martin's race and appearance, and Noffke testified that all of the discussion was for the purpose of identification of the suspect, and did not seem unusual. Wendy Dorival was the Sanford police neighborhood watch coordinator that helped to form the \\"Retreat at Twin Lakes\\" neighborhood watch program. Dorival testified as to various roles and duties that volunteers have within the neighborhood watch program, and that watch participants are instructed not to follow or confront suspects, but only to call the police to report suspicious activity. She said that Zimmerman called to organize a watch program, and about 25 residents attended the meeting. Because Zimmerman told her he was selected as the coordinator by the HOA, she gave Zimmerman the watch coordinator handbook, which instructed watch participants not to confront suspects and that the watch is \\"not the vigilante police\\". On cross- examination, she testified that the community was worried about recent burglaries, and that the community was not walled-in, so non-residents could enter and exit other than at the gates. Dorival testified that she attempted to recruit Zimmerman as a \\"Citizen on Patrol\\", but that he refused. She testified that she did not give any instructions about watch participants not being allowed to carry a gun as watch members. She testified that people should err on the side of caution and make calls to police if they think something might be suspicious, and categorized \\"walking in the rain without a purpose\\" as something that could be suspicious. Anthony Raimondo, a Sergeant with the Sanford police, was a responding officer to Zimmerman's non-emergency call and the shooting of Martin. He testified that it was raining at the time, and the lighting at the scene was very poor, and that when he arrived other officers were already on the scene. He saw Martin face down with his hands underneath him. He was unable to find a pulse, attempted CPR, but Martin was declared dead. He then placed a plastic sheet over Martin's body out of respect, and to preserve evidence from the rain. Diana Smith, the crime scene technician for the shooting (and wife of Tim Smith, the first officer on the scene) testified regarding the scene. Using photos and computer reconstructions of the scene, she pointed out locations of all the objects in the scene, as well as described photographs of Martin's body. She further testified to the process she used to gather DNA evidence, and photographs she took of Zimmerman at the station. On cross-examination, West asked her the methods she used to look for blood on the scene, and the timing of the collection of evidence. She testified that items are swabbed for touch DNA, but that the item itself is not directly tested. She said that someone could touch an item, but not leave sufficient cells for analysis, or those cells could be removed by later people touches. West then asked Smith to identify injuries to Zimmerman she saw the night of the shooting, visible in the photographs she had taken several hours after the incident. On redirect, Guy clarified she had assistance looking for blood at the scene, and that she did not see any blood at the scene, and was not notified of blood by any of those that assisted her. Sanford Police Department Officer Ricardo Ayala was dispatched to the scene on a suspicious persons call, that was later upgraded to \\"shots fired\\". Ayala testified that it was very dark and raining when he arrived, and Officer Smith (husband of Diana Smith who was the crime scene technician) was holding Zimmerman at gunpoint at that time. Ayala then approached Martin, and he believes he was the first officer to do so. Ayala did not know if Martin was alive or not, and as Martin's hands were beneath his face-down body, he told him to \\"show me your hands\\". Ayala did not see any sounds, words, or motions from Martin. Ayala and Officer Raimando attempted to perform CPR on Martin, and moved his body in doing so. In cross-examination Ayala testified that holding Zimmerman was standard procedure in a \\"shots fired\\" call, and was not an indication of any risk from Zimmerman at that time. Ayala testified that Zimmerman was not confrontational, and complied with all officer requests. Stacy Livingston is an EMT and firefighter with the Sanford Fire Department. Livingston testified that Martin was unresponsive and had no pulse when she arrived on the scene. Livingston said Martin was pronounced dead at 7:30 p.m. the night of the shooting. Livingston also testified that she treated Zimmerman at the scene, who had a swollen, bleeding nose and two cuts on the back of his head. When O'Mara asked if Zimmerman should have been concerned with his medical well-being because of his injuries, Livingston said, \\"Possibly.\\" Sanford Police Department Officer Timothy Smith was the first officer on the scene. Smith testified that when he saw Zimmerman after the shooting, his backside was wet and had grass blades on it. He also saw several injuries on Zimmerman, which included contusions, lacerations, and a bloody nose. Smith said that after Zimmerman had his gun taken away and was handcuffed, he told Smith that \\"he was yelling for help and nobody would come help him.\\" Smith also testified that Zimmerman said he was \\"lightheaded\\" during the drive to the police station but declined to go to a hospital. Sanford Police Department Officer Doris Singleton, assisted with the investigation of the incident and conducted interviews with Zimmerman at the police department on the night of the shooting. Singleton recorded her interview with Zimmerman, after reading Zimmerman his Miranda rights. Singleton testified that during her interview with Zimmerman, he told her that his neighborhood was dealing with an increase in burglaries, and he started a neighborhood watch program. He told her that he had previously called the police before on suspicious people, but often they weren't stopped. Zimmerman told Singleton that while in his car, he saw Martin walking in the neighborhood in the rain. Zimmerman said he called police and pulled over before Martin started circling his car and then walked off. Zimmerman also told Singleton that he got out of his car to find a street sign and to see where Martin was going. Zimmerman said in the interview that he was walking back to his car when Martin jumped out from the bushes and said to him, \\"What the fuck is your problem, homie?\\" Zimmerman said he got his cell phone out to call 911, and he told Martin, \\"I don't have a problem.\\" Martin then said to him, \\"No, now you have a problem.\\" Singleton testified that Zimmerman told her that Martin then punched him and was banging his head into the concrete. Zimmerman also said that within seconds, Martin's hand was moving down his body toward his gun, and fearing for his life, he shot Martin. Singleton testified that during her interview with him, Zimmerman didn't appear angry or spiteful to Martin. Sanford Police Department Christopher Serino was the lead investigator for the incident. Recordings of Serino's interviews with Zimmerman were played for the Jury as well as the reenactment that Zimmerman performed with Serino. On direct examination, Serino testified that Zimmerman said Martin came out and punched him and told him he was going to kill him. Serino said there was evidence to suggest that Zimmerman was still following Martin after the non-emergency dispatcher suggested that he not do so. Serino said red flags were raised for him when Zimmerman didn't know the names of the streets in his neighborhood, because there are only three. Serino testified that he felt Zimmerman exaggerated the number of times he was hit that night but said he didn't feel any \\"active deception\\" on Zimmerman's part when he said he got out of his vehicle to follow Martin to see what street he was on. Serino also testified that no major discrepancies came to his mind about the varying accounts given by Zimmerman at different times or with other witness accounts. Under cross examination Serino testified that Zimmerman did not seem \\"cagey\\" or to be sidestepping questions. When O'Mara asked Serino if he thought Zimmerman was telling the truth, Serino said yes. Judge Nelson ruled that the answer given to O'Mara's question, was an improper statement made by the witness about Zimmerman's credibility, and the jurors were to dismiss Serino's testimony in regards to the question and his answer. On re-direct, the prosecutor asked Serino, \\"If I were to believe that somebody was committing a crime, could that not be profiling that person?\\" Serino said it could be construed as such, yes. De La Rionda also asked Serino if there was any evidence that Martin was committing a crime that evening or any evidence that Martin was armed. Serino answered no. The prosecutor also questioned Serino about the language Zimmerman used in his call to police when Zimmerman said, \\"these fucking punks always get away.\\" De La Rionda asked, \\"Is that something you would use in reference to somebody that you're going to invite over to dinner?\\" Serino, said \\"No, sir, I would not.\\" He also asked him if he thought it was a friendly comment. Serino again answered, \\"No, sir, it does not.\\" Serino also testified that calling someone \\"fucking punks\\" is ill will and spite. =Expert witness testimony= Dr. Shiping Bao, the associate medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Martin testified that he didn't die immediately and that his heart was still beating after being shot. Bao said Martin was shot from intermediate range, which he defined as being between 0.4 inches to 4 feet and said the muzzle had loose contact with Martin's clothing. Bao also testified that he didn't believe that Martin could have moved after being shot. Dr. Bao stated that Martin was 5 feet 11 inches and 158 pounds when he died, was healthy at the time of the shooting and had a small abrasion on his fourth and fifth left finger. Bao also said that the knees of Martin's pants were stained. Dr. Valerie Rao, a medical examiner who reviewed video and photographs of Zimmerman's injuries, testified that she thought Zimmerman's wounds were \\"insignificant\\" and \\"non-life threatening.\\" She said that Zimmerman's head may have only hit the concrete a single time and the injuries were so minor that they were not consistent with grave force. Anthony Gorgone, a crime lab analyst with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, testified that he found no traces of Zimmerman's DNA in scrapings taken from Martin's fingernails. Gorgone said he did find both Zimmerman's and Martin's DNA on the gray sweatshirt Martin was wearing, and both of their DNA was found on Zimmerman's jacket. Gorgone said Zimmerman's DNA was found on the grip of his gun, but that Martin's was not found. Hirotaka Nakasone, a voice analysis expert was called by the state, after previously being called by the defense during the Frye hearing. Nakasone testified that the recordings of the screams on the 911 calls were of poor quality due to the distance from the phone, and compression introduced by the cell phone. He found 45 seconds of recording between the start of the screaming, until the gunshot. Of this approximately 19 seconds was actual screaming, of which 3.5 seconds were able to be isolated for analysis. He testified that it was not possible to do voice analysis on this data as it \\"is not fit for the purpose of voice comparison\\", which generally requires 30 seconds for analysis. He further testified that doing age estimation by listening or pitch analysis has a high margin of error. Nakasone testified that someone who is familiar with voices can recognize those voices and identify them more easily than someone who is unfamiliar with the voices. Nakasone testified that for these samples, someone who has heard a person in a variety of situations speaking, uttering, and screaming in a similar situation could be better able to recognize the speaker. On cross-examination, Nakasone testified that there can be significant listener bias which can impact the reliability of \\"familiar voice recognition\\", introduced by having multiple people attempting to identify a voice together. Nakasone testified that the same word repeated is generally unsuitable for analysis, because there is not a sufficient number of the phonemes which can be used to identify the voice. Nakasone said that the screams were made under \\"extreme duress\\" and in a \\"life-threatening situation\\", and that due to physiological changes during life-threatening screams, any analysis using such screaming is not possible. Nakasone also testified that using screams like this for age estimation would be \\"very very challenging\\" and that it would generally not be attempted. =Neighbors' testimony= Selene Bahadoor was a resident of the Retreat at Twin Lakes, who works in IT for a hospital. She was at home with relatives and friends on the night of the shooting. She testified that she heard noises outside, moving from the south (left) towards the north (right) towards the top of the T (where two sidewalks met), and went to her window and did not see anything, but moved to her sliding glass door and saw \\"figures and arms flailing\\" and that two people appeared to be standing, but it was too dark to identify them or their clothes. She said she heard something that sounded like \\"No\\" and then went back to her kitchen to turn off the stove, heard a shot, and then returned to the sliding door. At that time she saw someone lying in the grass face down. She saw several neighbors also looking at the scene, and then the police, but did not go outside. Bahadoor testified that she had previously known Zimmerman as a neighborhood watch person. On cross-examination by O'Mara, Bahadoor testified that she discussed her testimony with the police and did not recall if she had said the noise moved from south to north during her initial interview with Chris Serino or FDLE. When presented with her transcripts from those interviews, the transcripts said only \\"running\\" but not the direction. She testified that she had mentioned the left to right (south to north) motion to her sister. She \\"liked\\" the Justice4Trayvon Facebook page and signed the Change.org petition, but said she has sympathy for both families. She reiterated that it was too dark to see which participant was which, or what positions they were in. On redirect, she said she had not been asked about the direction of movement previously, and had not come forward earlier because she did not want to be in the public eye. On re-cross, she said that she had done an interview for national television, but that it did not air. Jayne Surdyka was a neighbor in the Retreat, who was in her upstairs bedroom at the time of the incident, and went to close her window due to the \\"pouring down rain\\", when she heard a loud \\"dominant\\" voice. She re-opened the window to see into the courtyard, and heard a voice that sounded \\"angry, very agitated\\" but that she could not hear words. She shut off her lights to reduce glare and see better, and saw two men on the ground one on top of the other. She heard a cry for help, that she thinks was made by \\"the boy\\", and then heard \\"pop, pop, pop\\". She saw one of the men get up, and hold his head while the other stayed on the ground face down. Surdyka's 911 call was then played. On cross-examination, the defense asked about the cries for help that she heard, and she confirmed she heard only two cries; one for help, and then a \\"yelp\\" just before the gunshot. West asked her if she had heard the other 911 calls and cries for help previously. West asked her if \\"the loud voice could have been someone on a cell phone in the wind\\", and she replied \\"I guess\\". She clarified that there was five to ten minutes between the initial \\"loud voice\\" and the later argument and fight; she assumed they were the same voice. She said that during the argument, the \\"loud\\" voice initiated, and a \\"meek\\" voice replying. She commented that when the porch lights are off, it is \\"pitch black\\" in the yard, but that she could see well enough to see that the person on top was wearing a dark or black shirt or jacket. West asked her to reconcile Martin's chest wound, with her testimony that Zimmerman stood up from on top, with Martin underneath him, face down. West pressed her to admit that she assumed which voice was which, but she replied that she felt the aggressive voice was \\"a man's\\", and that the other voice was higher pitched and she felt that it was \\"a boy's\\". Jeannee Manalo was with her family watching TV in the living room at the time of the incident, at her home in the Retreat. Manalo said she heard a \\"howling\\" sound, and looked out the sliding door, but was unable to see anything due to the darkness. Later, she heard a yelling that she thought was \\"help\\". She looked out and could not see anything, but heard struggling. After hearing \\"help\\", she returned to watching TV, and then only looked out again after hearing the gunshot. She then looked out again and saw two people on the grass, with a neighbor outside with them who was asking if he should call 911. Manalo testified that she did not notice the size at the time, but after seeing the news, she believes Zimmerman was on top. Manalo could not tell which person was screaming for help. After she heard the shot, she looked out again. Her husband went outside, and then returned to get a plastic Walmart bag to be used for CPR. On cross- examination, she said that noises seemed to move closer over the incident, moving from the top of the \\"T\\" slightly further south. West questioned Manalo about differences between her current recollections, and the statements she made during investigator interviews at the time. In her earlier statements, Manalo did not describe the sizes of the individuals, or compare them. West asked about seeing Zimmerman after the incident, and referred to a photo of his injuries, but Manalo replied that she did not get a good look at his face that night. West asked what photos she used to develop her understanding of the relative sizes of Martin and Zimmerman. She testified that she had seen full body photos of Zimmerman from the police station, and the \\"hoodie\\", \\"hollister\\", and \\"football\\" shots of Martin. She had not seen photos of Martin from the 7-Eleven surveillance video. She stated she did not look at photos of Zimmerman's injuries, including one taken by her husband, until later. Manolo testified that she may be wrong on the size comparison, and that \\"I don't know who's bigger now\\". She later testified that her opinion of the relative sizes of Martin and Zimmerman the night of the incident, was based on old photographs of Martin. After several rounds of questioning, she said her opinion of the sizes was based on the photographs, but that the person who was on top got up. Jennifer Lauer works in real estate, and was living in the Retreat at Twin lakes at the time of the incident. Lauer testified that she was in her living room watching Celebrity Apprentice on the television with the volume up \\"pretty high\\". Lauer testified that she did not see anything, due to her blinds being closed, and that her statements were based on what she heard. She heard voices in her backyard, but was unable to make out any words or tell how many people were talking, but she assumed it was two people due to the pattern. She said the sounds were coming from the left (north) outside her window. Lauer testified that both voices were about the same volume, and \\"flustered\\" instead of \\"confrontational\\". Lauer then muted the TV, and then immediately began to hear scuffling (\\"like playing basketball on pavement\\"), and the sound of shoes on pavement and grass. Lauer said she then heard \\"grunting\\", and \\"wrestling\\", or rolling in the grass, that was getting closer. Lauer said the grunting gradually turned into \\"yelping\\". Lauer and her husband called 911 about thirty seconds after she initially muted the TV. Lauer moved away from the window so that her call could not be heard outside, and while on the call, Lauer testified that she heard cries for help, and a gunshot. Lauer testified that there was only one voice yelling for help, but that she could not identify who it was, and that the cries for help stopped at the gunshot. Lauer and her husband (then fiancé) then went upstairs for safety, and did not look out the window. Lauer testified that she heard her neighbor, John Good, outside saying something like \\"what is going on\\" while the yelling continued. She testified that she did not hear anyone say \\"You are going to die motherfucker\\" or anything similar. Lauer's call to 911 was played for the jury. After her call, she heard talking outside, and someone saying \\"Take my gun\\". Lauer testified that while walking in front of her house, the address numbers on her house are visible from the sidewalk, but may be blocked depending on where you were standing on the walk. She also said that there are only 3 streets within the community. Lauer testified that she knew of Zimmerman from her role on the HOA board, but that she never formally met him. She was slightly aware of the neighborhood watch and that Zimmerman was involved, but did not know details. Lauer testified she could not identify the yells as Zimmerman's because she had not heard him yell in the meetings. On cross-examination, O'Mara clarified that the first thing that captured her attention was loud talking near the T, that was a back and forth discussion, but she could not make out words. Specifically she said she did not hear anyone say \\"what are you following me for\\", or \\"what are you doing here\\". Lauer testified that the cries for help or yelping had started before her 911 call began. She said that her ability to hear the yells in person was better than the ability to hear them on the 911 recordings. Lauer said the person yelling for help \\"was in danger\\", and \\"needed help\\" Jonathan (John) Good, a neighbor at the retreat, testified that he heard a faint noise outside and he could not tell the direction. As the noises grew louder, he looked outside through his blinds. He opened his door and looked out and saw \\"some sort of tussle\\" where the participants were on the ground. He called out \\"what's going on\\" and \\"stop it\\" as he started to step outside. Good said the participant wearing \\"dark or black\\" was on top, and the person wearing \\"red or white\\" was on the bottom, and the person on the bottom had lighter skin. He described the person on top had their legs straddling the person on the bottom, who was face up. He could not hear any pounding or hitting, but did see \\"downward arm motion, multiple times\\" that \\"looked like punches\\" from the person on top. He heard a \\"help\\" from the person on the bottom, and Good said \\"cut it out\\", and that he was going to call 911. He went back inside to call 911, but he heard a gunshot before the call was completed. Good's call to 911 was played for the jury. Good testified that his statement in earlier interviews of \\"MMA-style\\" was in reference to the person on top straddling the person on the bottom, and striking them. He testified he did not see the person on top slamming the person on bottom's body or head into the concrete. He said the recorded calls for help from the other's 911 calls did not sound the same as the cries for help he heard. On cross-examination he stated that he could not be sure that additional hitting or head pounding was not happening, he just did not see well enough to say that it did happen. Using photographs of Zimmerman and Martin from that night, he identified Martin as the person on top, and Zimmerman as the person on the bottom.Bobby Martinez in Sanford Florida and Laura Italiano and David K. Li of New York - \\"'Not Guilty' In Trayvon Slay\\" - New York Post - Sunday - July 14, 2013 - pg 5. newyorkpost.com. Retrieved July 14, 2013. Defense attorney West had Good go over a sketch of the scene and positions of the participants that he had made shortly after the incident. Between the time Good was initially outside, and when his 911 call began, he went upstairs and down a hallway to get his phone, at which time he looked out a window and saw Martin's body on the ground. Good stated that in his opinion it was Zimmerman's voice screaming for help. Jonathan Manalo, whose wife testified earlier, told the jury he was the first person to make contact with Zimmerman after the shooting. Manalo said that Zimmerman was calm and easy to understand before police arrived. Manalo said as soon as he saw Zimmerman, he started explaining what happened. Manalo testified that Zimmerman told him that he was defending himself when he shot Martin. Manalo also testified that after police arrived, Zimmerman asked him to call his wife and \\"tell her I shot someone.\\" =Rachel Jeantel= Rachel Jeantel, Witness No. 8, was a friend of Martin's in elementary school and high school. Jeantel testified that she was on the phone with Martin during the incident and that they were on the phone together while Martin was at the 7-Eleven. The call was disconnected and Martin later called her back. Jeantel testified that during the second call, Martin said a man was watching him, but that she did not think it was a \\"big idea.\\" Jeantel asked Martin how the man looked and he told her that he was \\"a creepy-ass cracker.\\" Jeantel warned Martin to walk away because \\"it might be a rapist.\\" Martin, she said, told her that the \\"nigga is still following me\\" so he was going to try to \\"lose him\\" and get back to the home where he was staying. As Jeantel remained on the phone with Martin, he said, \\"the nigga is behind me.\\" The man who was allegedly following him reappeared and Martin said, \\"Why are you following me for,\\" and then Jeantel heard a hard breathed man come and say \\"What are you doing around here?\\" Jeantel testified that she said \\"Trayvon, Trayvon\\" and she \\"started to hear a little bit of Trayvon saying, get off, get off.\\" Jeantel then said she heard Martin's phone headset fall and Martin say \\"get off.\\" The phone went dead and Jeantel says she didn't speak to Martin again. Jeantel also testified that she believes the screams heard on the 911 call were Martin's, because \\"Trayvon has kind of a baby voice.\\" On cross-examination by defense attorney Don West, Jeantel testified that she had lied about her reasons for not going to Martin's funeral and said the reason she didn't go was because she felt guilty and didn't want to see the body. West asked her why she didn't call police after the phone went dead. Jeantel said, \\"I thought he was going to be OK because he was right by his daddy's house.\\" West also asked her about the last thing she had heard, which was \\"something hitting somebody.\\" Jeantel told West that \\"Trayvon got hit,\\" and West then asked her \\"You don't know that, do you?\\" Jeantel testified, \\"No sir.\\" West also questioned her about the term \\"creepy ass cracker.\\" West asked her, \\"Do people that you live around and with call white people 'creepy ass crackers'?\\" Jeantel said, \\"Not creepy, but cracker, yeah.\\" West then asked her if she was saying that people in her community and culture that she lives in called white people crackers. Jeantel testified, \\"Yes, sir.\\" West also asked her if she thought the term was a racial comment and offensive. Jeantel said she didn't believe \\"creepy ass cracker\\" is a racial comment and said \\"No\\" it wasn't offensive. She also testified that the reference to cracker referred to \\"a pervert.\\" Jeantel said she never told anyone about Martin saying that term until a year after the shooting. Zimmerman's defense attorney asked her if Martin had perhaps lied to her because he did not want her to know if he decided to assault Zimmerman that night. Jeantel testified, \\"that's real retarded, sir. That's real retarded to do that, sir. Why on earth – Trayvon did not know.\\" During the trial, a letter to Sybrina Fulton, Treyvon's mother, was presented as evidence. The letter outlined what was supposedly overheard on a phone call in the moments before the fight between Martin and Zimmerman broke out. It was written in cursive and signed with the printed name \\"Diamond Eugene.\\" Jeantel claimed the letter was from her, prepared with the help of a friend. However, when asked on the stand if she was able to read the letter to verify its contents, Jeantel admitted \\"I don't read cursive.\\" https://nypost.com/2013/06/28/trayvon- martins-girlfriend-admits-she-cant-read-the-letter-she-supposedly-wrote-to- his-mother-about-his-death/ Jeantel claimed that the name \\"Diamond Eugene\\" was her nickname. https://www.businessinsider.com/rachel-jeantels-inconsistent- story-2013-6 (In December of 2019, Zimmerman filed a lawsuit claiming that Jeantel bore false testimony in place of her half-sister Brittany Diamond Eugene whom the lawsuit claims was Trayvon Martin's real girlfriend at the time of Travyon's death. The lawsuit it currently ongoing. https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-50671843 https://www.theguardian.com/us- news/2019/dec/04/george-zimmerman-trayvon-martin-lawsuit) Defense's case Defense's witnesses' testimony On July 5, the defense began presenting their case to the jury. The first defense witness to take the stand was Zimmerman's mother, Gladys Zimmerman. After listening to the 911 call, O'Mara asked her whose voice was in the background, She testified \\"That's my son, George.\\" She also stated, \\"That way he is screaming, it describes to me anguish, fear. I would say terror.\\" On cross examination, Bernie de la Rionda asked Zimmerman's mother if she had ever heard her son screaming before. She testified \\"Not for help\\" but was \\"sure that is George's voice.\\" Sondra Osterman, wife of Zimmerman's friend Mark Osterman, testified that the voice screaming for help on the 911 tape was \\"definitely\\" that of Zimmerman. She stated, \\"Yes, definitely, it's Georgie, I hear it, I hear him screaming.\\" Osterman also said that she had known Zimmerman since 2006, when they worked together at a mortgage company. When questioned about her husband's book that he wrote about the shooting, she stated that it had not affected her testimony in the case. She testified that \\"I wouldn't lie for him or for anybody.\\" She also testified she did not think Zimmerman's use of an expletive on the 911 call indicated any ill-will or hatred on his behalf. She stated, \\"I don't think he was angry.\\" Mark Osterman, a friend of Zimmerman and federal air marshal, testified that he heard Zimmerman screaming in the background of the 911 call. He stated, \\"It sounded like George.\\" He also testified that he had discussed gun safety with Zimmerman and took him to a gun range. Osterman said that Zimmerman was \\"very safe all the time\\" with his handgun. When questioned about the gun Zimmerman owned, Osterman stated, \\"It's a reliable firearm,\\" and also said that he had recommended to Zimmerman that he keep a round chambered in the weapon. During cross-examination by Bernie de la Rionda, Osterman said he was unsure how many copies his book, Defending our Friend; the Most Hated Man in America, has sold and stated that all proceeds would go for Zimmerman. Geri Russo, a friend of Zimmerman's who had previously worked with him, testified that it was Zimmerman screaming for help on the 911 tape. She testified, \\"I recognize his voice, I've heard him speak many times, I have no doubt in my mind that's his voice.\\" Friends of Zimmerman, Leanne Benjamin and John Donnelly, who are husband and wife, testified separately that it was Zimmerman screaming for help on the 911 tape. Benjamin testified that she had formerly worked with him and stated, \\"I know his voice, I know what his voice sounds like when he gets excited or loud.\\" Donnelly testified that he had found it \\"distressing\\" to listen to the 911 tape due to his combat experience in Vietnam and said \\"There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that is George Zimmerman and I wish to God I didn't have the ability to understand that.\\" Donnelly also testified that he contributed money to Zimmerman's defense fund and purchased some suits for Zimmerman to wear at his trial. Zimmerman's uncle, Jorge Meza, a former U.S. Army Command Sergeant Major, and currently employed by the Orange County Sheriff's Office, testified that he had known Zimmerman since \\"Oct. 5, 1983. The day he was born.\\" Meza said he had been working on his computer last year when he heard Zimmerman's voice being broadcast on a news report that his wife was watching on television. Meza testified he instantly recognized the voice, and said he hadn't been watching the television news report with his wife, and that she had not told him it was about his nephew. Meza testified about the voice he had heard, saying that: \\"It is the unique way you recognize your family member when they laugh, when they cry, this was the moment I recognized it was George screaming for help. That voice just came and hit me.\\" He also testified that \\"It hit me the way I heard that, but more than heard that, I felt it inside of my heart. I said, That's George.\\" Adam Pollock, owner of a kickboxing gym where Zimmerman had previously trained, testified that Zimmerman was \\"grossly obese,\\" and not athletic at all. Pollock also testified that \\"He was an overweight, large man when he came to us, a very pleasant, very nice man, but physically soft and predominantly fat, not a lot of muscle, not a lot of strength.\\" He also testified that Zimmerman came to the gym to lose weight and get in shape. Pollock was asked to demonstrate for the jury what the mixed-martial arts fighting method known as \\"ground and pound\\" was, and showed the jury by straddling O'Mara on the floor of the courtroom. Olivia Bertalan, a former neighbor of Zimmerman's from The Retreat at Twin Lakes, testified that she was the victim of a home invasion in the gated community. Bertalan said that she hid in her son's bedroom as two teenagers broke into her home. After the robbery, she said that Zimmerman had come over to her house and offered her a lock for her sliding glass door. Bertalan also testified that Zimmerman told her that she could go spend time with his wife if she felt too scared to be home alone during the day. She estimated that she had discussed the robbery with Zimmerman about 20 times after it happened. Testimony about 911 call played for Martin's father and family members Chris Serino testified that Martin's father, Tracy Martin, indicated to him the voice heard screaming in the 911 call did not sound like his son's. Serino testified that he played the 911 call for Tracy Martin in the Sanford Police Department a few days after February 26, 2012. Serino said that after Martin listened to the call, he became \\"emotional.\\" Serino also testified that he asked Martin whether or not the voice screaming on the 911 call sounded like his son's. He said Martin's response was more of a \\"verbal and a non-verbal,\\" and that \\"He looked away and under his breath, as I interpreted it, said no.\\" During cross examination, Bernie de la Rionda suggested to Serino that Tracy Martin may have been in denial about his son's death and that's why he uttered \\"no.\\" Serino responded, \\"It could be perceived as denial.\\" Doris Singleton, who was a witness to the meeting at the police station between Serino and Tracy Martin testified, \\"I don't know his exact words, but Tracy Martin was telling Chris it was not his son's voice. He was very upset, he was very sad, he hung his head, he cried.\\" Singleton also testified that she became \\"choked up\\" while watching Martin listen to the tape. Tracy Martin testified that during his meeting with Serino to listen to the 911 call, he never told him he didn't recognize his son's voice. Martin testified that he was unsure and said \\"I can't tell.\\" Martin said that after he had listened to the 911 call at least 20 times at the Sanford mayor's office, he was sure it was his son's voice. Sanford City Manager Norton Bonaparte, testified about inviting the family of Trayvon Martin to listen to the 911 call prior to the call being released to the public and media. Bonaparte said the mayor was also present for the meeting at city hall and law enforcement officials were requested not to attend. Bonaparte also testified he played the 911 tapes as a courtesy for the Martin family before they were released publicly. Bonaparte said that during the playing of the tape that none of the family members' reactions were recorded. Bill Lee, former Sanford police chief, testified that he recommended the tape of the 911 call be played for Martin's family individually, rather than in a group, to avoid any improper influences. Lee said that he had offered to be in the room when the 911 tape was played, but the city manager declined to have him or other police officials present. Lee stated that it was rare for the mayor and city manager to become involved in police investigations. The former police chief also testified \\"the evidence in testimony gave us an indication who was screaming on the tape.\\" Expert witness testimony Dr. Vincent Di Maio, a forensic pathologist and gunshot wound expert, testified that Martin's gunshot wound was consistent with Zimmerman's story that Martin was on top of him and leaning over him when he was shot. The gunshot evidence indicated that Martin's clothing was from two to four inches from his body when he was shot, Di Maio said, \\"If you lean over someone, you notice the clothing tends to fall away from the chest, if instead you're lying on your back and someone shoots you, the clothing is going to be against your chest.\\" Di Maio said he had examined photographs and the autopsy and toxicology reports and concluded that the evidence was consistent with Zimmerman's statements to police. Di Maio testified the path of the bullet ran from Martin's left side through part of his heart and into a portion of the right lung. Di Maio stated, \\"The medical evidence...is consistent with his [Zimmerman's] statement.\\" Di Maio also testified that Zimmerman had at least six injuries from the struggle: two head lacerations, two wounds to his temples and wounds on his nose and forehead. Di Maio said those injuries were consistent with Zimmerman having his head banged into a sidewalk, and that such injuries can be dangerous. Di Maio stated it's possible to receive trauma without visible wounds, testifying that, \\"You can get severe trauma to the head without external injuries, actually.\\" Di Maio said Zimmerman's nose may have been fractured, which was consistent with Zimmerman being punched in the nose. The pathologist testified that Martin lived no more than three minutes after the shooting and probably was conscious for at least 10 to 15 seconds. Di Maio said that someone may be able to move their arms after receiving a similar gunshot. Di Maio also testified that if clothes taken into evidence are wet and packaged in plastic bags, and not paper bags, it can ruin the samples since \\"bacteria multiplies and you get mold and it stinks to high heaven.\\" Dennis Root, a former police officer with training in firearms and self-defense and an use-of-force expert, testified the fight between Zimmerman and Martin went on for some 40 seconds and was marked by a high level of fear and anxiety. Root said \\"That's a very long time to be involved in any type of physical altercation.\\" Root further stated that \\"If you have not successfully completed the fight, if you have not won the fight in 30 seconds, change tactics, because the tactics you are using are not working.\\" Defense rests its case Zimmerman's defense offered their last witness, Zimmerman's father, Robert Zimmerman, who testified that he believes it was his son who was screaming on the 911 tape. George Zimmerman was then questioned by the judge about testifying in his own defense and he stated \\"After consulting with counsel, [I've decided] not to testify, your honor.\\" The defense rested its case on Wednesday, July 10. Motions to acquit After the prosecution rested its case, the defense made a motion to acquit, arguing that the prosecution had not provided sufficient evidence to prove murder beyond a reasonable doubt. After hearing arguments from both sides, the motion was denied by the judge. Second motion to acquit After the defense rested its case, a second motion for acquittal was made, with the defense asking the state to provide their narrative of the event, which precluded a self-defense situation. The judge ruled that there was sufficient evidence for the case to proceed to the jury. Closing arguments Prosecution's argument State Attorney Bernie de la Rionda opened his closing argument on Friday, July 12 by telling the jurors that \\"a teenager is dead through no fault of his own\\" because Zimmerman had made assumptions about Martin and acted on them. Rionda stated to the jury that Zimmerman profiled Martin as a criminal and assumed certain things, that Martin was up to no good, and that's what led to Martin's death. De la Rionda argued that Zimmerman took the law into his own hands, accusing Zimmerman of following Trayvon Martin because Zimmerman wanted to be a policeman and take down someone whom he \\"profiled\\" as a criminal. The prosecutor also focused in on inconsistencies in Zimmerman's statements, calling the defendant a \\"liar\\".  Defense's argument  Mark O'Mara began his closing arguments by asking the jurors to use common sense when considering the evidence in the confrontation between Zimmerman and Martin. O'Mara argued to the jury to not \\"fill in the gaps\\" or to \\"connect the dots\\", but to stick to the facts while considering their verdict. O'Mara told the jury that you can't help but have a first impression and \\"what you have to do is be vigilant, diligent when deciding this case.\\" O'Mara said that Zimmerman is \\"not guilty of anything but protecting his own life\\". O'Mara also showed a chunk of concrete to the jury, telling them that Martin was not an unarmed teenager when he allegedly hit Zimmerman's head against the sidewalk. Mark O'Mara asked the jury how many \\"coulda beens\\" and \\"what ifs\\" have you heard from the state in this case. O'Mara also told the jury to not give anybody \\"the benefit of the doubt except for George Zimmerman.\\" Prosecution's rebuttal argument Prosecutor John Guy delivered the state's rebuttal argument after the defense finished their closing argument. Guy told the jury that in order to know what happened that night, they should look \\"into the heart of the grown man and the heart of the child.\\" Guy also argued to the jurors that if Zimmerman had done what he was supposed to do, none of us would be here. Guy also said that if Zimmerman had really wanted the police to get Martin, he would have stayed in his car and waited for the police. Jury instructions Judge Nelson ruled that the lesser included offense of manslaughter could be considered by the jury and would be included in the jury instructions. The prosecution had requested that a lesser charge of third-degree felony murder, an offense that includes the commission of child abuse, be included in the jury instructions. Defense attorney Don West called the possible lesser charge \\"outrageous\\" and a \\"trick\\" by the state, because they had asked for it to be included at the last minute. Judge Nelson ruled that the jury would not be able to consider the offense of third-degree murder.  Jury verdict  On Saturday, July 13, 2013, the day after deliberations began, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty for both second-degree murder and the lesser included charge of manslaughter. The jury deliberated for sixteen hours before arriving at a verdict, which was read in court shortly after 10 pm EST. Following the announcement of the verdict, defense attorney Mark O'Mara told reporters at the courthouse that he was ecstatic with the decision by the jury. O'Mara thanked local law enforcement, the jury, and the time and effort they put into the process. Defense attorney Don West said he was still angry that Zimmerman was even brought to trial. West said that the prosecution of Zimmerman was \\"disgraceful\\" and that he was \\"thrilled the jury kept this tragedy from becoming a travesty\\". In response to a question from the media, O'Mara also claimed that if Zimmerman \\"had been black, he never would have been charged with a crime\\".Cadet, Danielle \\"Mark O'Mara: If George Zimmerman Were Black 'He Never Would've Been Charged With A Crime' \\" The Huffington Post July 14, 2013 When asked if Zimmerman had been overcharged in the case, State Attorney Angela Corey told reporters after the verdict that the allegations against Zimmerman \\"fit the bill\\" for a second- degree murder charge. Prosecutor de la Rionda said that he was disappointed with, but respected, the jury's verdict. Public response Supporters of Zimmerman were happy the jury took the side of Zimmerman's claim that he shot Martin in self-defense, while other supporters said that the prosecution had failed to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. Supporters were also outside the courthouse in Sanford, Florida, rejoicing the not guilty verdict. Some supporters at the courthouse said the jury made the right decision because they felt that Zimmerman shot and killed Martin in self-defense. Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson said that he was stunned by the decision and that the Department of Justice must intervene to take it to another level. Benjamin Jealous, president of the NAACP, said that he had spoken to senior justice officials about pursuing federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman. Al Sharpton said the verdict was a \\"slap in the face to the American people\\" and urged action by federal officials. Zimmerman's attorney Mark O'Mara said that if anyone tries to sue Zimmerman, \\"we will seek and we will get civil immunity in a civil hearing, and we will see just how many civil lawsuits have spawned from this fiasco\\". Police in Oakland, California, said about one hundred people protested, with some protesters breaking windows and starting fires in the streets. Protesters there also reportedly vandalized a police car, burned an American flag and a California state flag, and spray-painted a county courthouse. Other protests in support of the Martin family occurred in Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Denver, Baltimore, Detroit and New York City, among others. Zimmerman's father tweeted after the verdict: \\"Our whole family is relieved. Today...I'm proud to be an American.\\" Zimmerman's brother told CNN's Piers Morgan that \\"I don't think this is a time for high-fiving.\\" He also told Morgan that \\"we have all acknowledged that Martin lost his life, but it was neither an act of murder, nor an act of manslaughter.\\" Martin's father, Tracy Martin tweeted after the verdict was announced: \\"Even though I am broken hearted my faith is unshattered I will always love my baby Tray.\\" Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton tweeted: \\"Lord during my darkest hour I lean on you. You are all that I have. At the end of the day, GOD is still in control. Thank you all for your prayers and support. I will love you forever Trayvon!!! In the name of Jesus!!!\\" President Obama said after the verdict that \\"we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.\\" Musician Stevie Wonder told a concert audience in Canada after the verdict, that he had decided until the stand your ground law is abolished in Florida, he would never perform there again. Wonder also told the audience that he would not perform in any state or part of the world where that law exists. According to CNN, there are currently 22 states that have a version of the stand your ground law, including his home state of Michigan, and current state of California. California has justifiable homicide provisions, as distinct from \\"Stand Your Ground.\\" To the contrary, the state provides civil remedy for injury caused by self-help--even for intentional infliction of emotional distress. See Official Reports Opinions Online Former President Jimmy Carter said the jury made the \\"right decision\\" based on the evidence presented by the prosecution. Carter said, \\"It's not a moral question, it's a legal question and the American law requires that the jury listens to the evidence presented.\\" Basketball star Charles Barkley said that he agreed with the verdict. He added that he thought that Zimmerman was wrong to pursue, and that racial profiling was involved, but he thought that Martin did \\"flip the switch and start beating ... Mr. Zimmerman\\". He said that he was sorry Martin was killed, but looking at the evidence, he didn't think Zimmerman should go to jail for the rest of his life. Juror comments Two days following the conclusion of the trial, one of the jurors (Juror B37) spoke with Anderson Cooper of CNN about her experience as a member of the jury. She said that in an initial vote, three of the jurors had voted to find Zimmerman not guilty, but two had voted to find him guilty of manslaughter and one had voted to find him guilty of second-degree murder: \\"there was a couple of them in there that wanted to find him guilty of something and after hours and hours and hours of deliberating over the law, and reading it over and over and over again, we decided there's just no way, other place to go.\\" Jurors cried when they submitted their final vote to the court officer, she said. Juror B37 told Cooper that she believed \\"It pretty much happened the way George said it happened.\\" She believed the defense's argument that Martin had thrown the first punch in the confrontation and that it was Zimmerman's calls for help that were heard on the 911 call recordings, and she said that Zimmerman, fearing he was at risk of bodily harm or even loss of his life, had had a right to protect himself. In response to Cooper's questioning, she said that former lead police investigator Chris Serino's testimony that he had believed Zimmerman was telling the truth had made a strong impression on her (although Judge Nelson had instructed the jury that they should disregard Serino's comment and not consider it in rendering a verdict). Juror B37 also said that she did not believe Zimmerman had made any assumptions about Martin on the basis of Martin's skin color: \\"I think all of us thought race did not play a role.... We never had that discussion.\\" The juror said she believed that ultimately both Martin and Zimmerman were partly to blame for the outcome. \\"It's a tragedy this happened. But it happened.... And I think both were responsible for the situation they had gotten themselves into. I think both of them could have walked away. It just didn't happen.\\" On the same day that Juror B37's interview with Anderson Cooper was broadcast, it was announced that Juror B37 and her attorney husband had contacted a literary agent on July 14, one day following the conclusion of the trial, and had signed to write a book about the case. The next day, the literary agent tweeted that she was rescinding her offer of representing her \\"after careful consideration.\\" An online campaign, particularly on Black Twitter, to stop the publication had garnered over one thousand signatures at change.org. Neither the juror nor her agent said the campaign was the reason for cancelling the project. The literary agent released a statement from Juror B37 on Twitter which said the \\"isolation shielded me from the depth of pain that exists among the general public over every aspect of this case.\\" Four of the other jurors released a statement saying that Juror B37's views should not be regarded as representative of their views on the trial. Juror B29, a 36-year-old Puerto Rican mother of eight children, who was living in Chicago at the time of the shooting, was interviewed about the trial on July 25. She said, \\"George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God. And at the end of the day, he's going to have a lot of questions and answers he has to deal with.\\" She said that as the jury began deliberations, she wanted to convict Zimmerman of second-degree murder, and she held to her position that Zimmerman should be found guilty even after all the other jurors had decided to find him not guilty. However, she said that after nine hours of deliberations, she realized that there was not enough evidence to convict Zimmerman under Florida law: \\"As the law was read to me, if you have no proof that he killed him intentionally, you can't say he's guilty....you can't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty.\\" The juror said that she felt like she owed Martin's parents an apology because she felt she had let them down. Notable responses On the eve of the verdict, criminal law experts interviewed by CNN agreed that acquittal was likely. Christopher Darden, trial prosecutor in the O.J. Simpson murder case, said the prosecution's case lacked evidence: \\"[J]ust about everything the prosecution has asserted in this case has been addressed by the defense and refuted. ... [Y]ou have to wonder if you're a juror sitting on this case, why was this prosecution brought in the first place? ... I mean, there are just huge, huge holes in the prosecution's case.\\" Criminal defense attorney Diana Tennis agreed, saying in part: \\"[W]e have a rule of law, we have a very high burden in criminal cases for a reason, no matter what the color of any party and in the USA you don't get convicted typically on evidence that is not better than this.\\"THE LEAD WITH JAKE TAPPER (transcript) Aired July 8, 2013 - 16:30 ET Attorney and former Court TV anchor Jami Floyd told BET, \\"It is clear that George Zimmerman pursued Trayvon Martin and that he shot him. But it boils down to the question of who threw the first punch. There are only two people who could answer that question, and one of them is dead.\\" Alan Dershowitz told the BBC that the verdict was \\"right\\" since there was \\"reasonable doubt\\" as to Zimmerman's guilt.Trayvon Martin case: George Zimmerman verdict 'was right', BBC, July 14, 2013 In regards to the prosecution, he said to Mike Huckabee: \\"She (State Attorney Angela Corey) submitted an affidavit that was, if not perjurious, completely misleading. She violated all kinds of rules of the profession, and her conduct bordered on criminal conduct. [...] Halfway through the trial she realized she wasn't going to get a second degree murder verdict, so she asked for a compromised verdict, for manslaughter. And then, she went even further and said that she was going to charge him with child abuse and felony murder. That was such a stretch that it goes beyond anything professionally responsible. She was among the most irresponsible prosecutors I've seen in 50 years of litigating cases, and believe me, I've seen good prosecutors, bad prosecutors, but rarely have I seen one as bad as this prosecutor.\\" ABC chief legal affairs anchor Dan Abrams called it \\"the right legal verdict\\". He said the prosecution had a tough case from the start, and, \\"as a legal matter, I don't see how they [the jury] could have reached another verdict, considering how the law works with regard to self-defense\\". After the trial, as calls to prosecute Zimmerman for an alleged federal civil right violation were heard, The Los Angeles Times editorial board wrote that such a move was unwarranted by the evidence and could amount to double jeopardy: \\"[Zimmerman] shouldn't have assumed that Martin was up to no good, and he shouldn't have pursued him after a police dispatcher warned him not to. And yet not every tragedy or bad judgment is proof of a crime, much less a federal civil rights violation.\\"Why try George Zimmerman?, Los Angeles Times (July 16, 2013) See also Notes References External links * Court documents and evidence: ** State v.

A basic tenet of “traditional _conspiracy theory_ ” is that each co-conspirator is liable for acts of co-conspirators “during the existence of and in furtherance of the conspiracy.” Procedures and proof requirements for conspiracy theory litigation as well as the definition of ‘conspiracy’ vary by jurisdiction (British, U.S., …) and body of law (criminal, civil, …). In civil litigation, it can offer advantages relative to aiding-and-abetting or joint tortfeasor case theories. Conspiracy, theory, and conspiracy theory litigation In popular usage, the term ‘conspiracy’ means a secret agreement of two or more persons usually to commit a bad act. In a broad legal sense, it is an agreement to commit an unlawful act; in British and some American courts, lawful acts done in an unlawful manner (in British parlance, a ‘conspiracy to injure’; in American, a ‘true conspiracy’) are also included. Some states require an overt act. (Common law rule does not.) Whereas in a criminal conspiracy, the substantive offense is a crime, in civil law, the wrong is most likely a recognized intentional tort. A theory of a case (aka ‘case theory’) is “a detailed, coherent, accurate story of what occurred\\" involving both legal theory (i.e., claims/causes of action or affirmative defenses) and factual theory (i.e., an explanation of how a particular course of events could have happened). Particular classes of conspiracy theories address, e.g., antitrust (per Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1) and RICO. A prominent concept in conspiracy law is Pinkerton liability where a conspiracy theory can be used to hold a co-conspirator liable for a substantive offense committed by another co-conspirator “if the offense was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the agreement”. In civil law, a conspiracy theory 1) exempts co-conspirator testimony from the rule against hearsay; 2) exposes deep-pocket defendants to more liability than available under an aiding-and-abetting theory; 3) can impose joint liability on non- residents of the jurisdiction not liable under joint tortfeasor theory. Taxonomy From a 9th Circuit case: \\"In the taxonomy of _conspiracy theories_ , a 'chain conspiracy' is one in which each person is responsible for a distinct act within the overall plan, while a 'wheel conspiracy' involves a single member or group, i.e., the 'hub', separately agreeing with two or more other members or groups, i.e., the 'spokes'.\\" Examples of term conspiracy theory in use *Justice Sonia Sotomayor: \\"A conspiracy theory says you don't have to commit every act.\\" (Comment during oral argument in Husky International Electronics, Inc., v. Daniel Lee Ritz, Jr.) *In Federal jury instructions: \\"… There was evidence that the defendant masterminded the narcotics conspiracy and the plan to rob the undercover officer, and that evidence fully justified the defendant's conviction on an accomplice or conspiracy theory, regardless of where he was on the date of the murder.

Alibi—Explained, Second Circuit) * In preparation for the Nuremberg trials: \\"The American proposal is that we utilize the conspiracy theory by which a common plan or understanding to accomplish an illegal end by any mean, or to accomplish any end by illegal means, renders everyone who participated liable for the acts of every other.\\" (From the Minutes of Conference Session of July 4, 1945.

The Bakken – Three Forks Petroleum System in the Williston Basin, Rocky Mountain Association of Geologists (www.rmag.org) Johnson has been recognized for this achievement by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) and the Rocky Mountain Association of Geologists (RMAG). Over the years, oil companies had drilled a number of dry holes through the oil-bearing Bakken Shale at Parshall. Johnson had examined the well log of a decades-old dry hole drilled near the town of Parshall, and noticed that the Bakken interval looked similar to Bakken pay in the Elm Coulee Oil Field, a Bakken oil field on the southwest margin of the Williston Basin, in Montana. Believing that he might have another Elm Coulee on the east side of the basin, except with a different trapping mechanism, he and a partner leased a large land position, and made a deal for EOG to drill it.How to discover an elephant sized field, E&P; Magazine, 2009 EOG drilled the discovery well, the horizontal Parshall #1-36H, in 2006, located next to a dry hole drilled in 1981. Like wells in Elm Coulee, the Parshall well was drilled horizontally in the middle member of the Bakken. Oil flowed to the surface during drilling, even before hydraulic fracturing.Louise S. Durham, \\"Experience paid off at Parshall,\\" AAPG Explorer, June 2009. EOG quickly expanded the field by drilling development wells. Drilling soon defined the eastern edge of the field, a trap formed by eastern edge of the oil maturity window. Oil well drilling spread north, south, and west over a wide area, and soon extended Bakken oil production well beyond the boundaries of Parshall Field as defined by the North Dakota Industrial Commission. Bakken and Three Forks oil production have since been shown to form a very large laterally continuous oil reservoir, extending from Parshall on the east, west to past the Montana state line; however, the continuous Bakken/Three Forks productive area is split up administratively into many different oil fields. Production The field was developed by horizontal wells, and massive hydraulic fracturing. Through March 2013, the field has produced 65 million barrels of oil and 30 billion cubic feet of natural gas, from more than 200 wells.

The bill would amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to give new directions to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) governing its regulation creation and amendment process. The SEC would be required to assess the significance of the problem they are considering addressing, determine whether the estimated costs would outweigh the estimated benefits, and identify alternatives to their proposed regulation. The bill is intended to help protect the financial sector from excessive, burdensome regulations created by the SEC. The bill would do this by ordering the SEC to conduct a cost-benefit study before issuing any new rules to ensure that the expected benefits of the new rule would outweigh the expected costs of imposing it. Background The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is an agency of the United States federal government. It holds primary responsibility for enforcing the federal securities laws and regulating the securities industry, the nation's stock and options exchanges, and other electronic securities markets in the United States.A-Z Index of U.S. Government Departments and Agencies USA.gov The SEC was \\"in the process of finalizing scores of new rules,\\" including ones related to Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, at the time that this bill was introduced and voted on by the house. Most other agencies are already required to run cost-benefit analyses, the SEC has previously been exempt from Office of Management and Budget oversight. Provisions/Elements of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The SEC Regulatory Accountability Act would amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to direct the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), before issuing a regulation under the securities laws, to: :(1) identify the nature and source of the problem that the proposed regulation is designed to address in order to assess whether any new regulation is warranted; :(2) use the SEC Chief Economist to assess the costs and benefits of the intended regulation and adopt it only upon a reasoned determination that its benefits justify the costs; :(3) identify and assess available alternatives that were considered; and :(4) ensure that any regulation is accessible, consistent, written in plain language, and easy to understand. The SEC Regulatory Accountability Act would also require the SEC to: :(1) consider whether the rulemaking will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation; :(2) consider the impact of the regulation upon investor choice, market liquidity, and small business; :(3) explain in its final rule the nature of comments received concerning the proposed rule or rule change; and :(4) respond to those comments, explaining any changes made in response and the reasons that it did not incorporate industry group concerns regarding potential costs or benefits. The SEC Regulatory Accountability Act would also require the SEC to: :(1) review its existing regulations periodically to determine if they are outmoded, ineffective, insufficient, or excessively burdensome; and :(2) modify, streamline, expand, or repeal them. The SEC Regulatory Accountability Act would also require the SEC, whenever it adopts or amends a major rule, to state in its adopting release: :(1) the purposes and intended consequences of the regulation, :(2) the post-implementation quantitative and qualitative metrics to measure the economic impact of the regulation and the extent to which it has accomplished the stated purposes, :(3) the assessment plan that will be used under the supervision of the Chief Economist to assess whether the regulation has achieved those purposes, and :(4) any foreseeable unintended or negative consequences. The SEC Regulatory Accountability Act would require the assessment plan to: :(1) consider the costs, benefits, and intended and unintended consequences of the regulation; and :(2) specify the data to be collected, the methods for its collection and analysis, and an assessment completion date. The SEC Regulatory Accountability Act would waive notice and comment requirements for the data collection if the SEC has published its assessment plan for notice and comment at least 30 days before adoption of a final regulation or amendment. Finally the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act would express the sense of Congress that other regulatory entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and any national securities association registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, should also follow the requirements set forth by this title. Congressional Budget Office Report H.R. 1062 would expand the amount of analysis performed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when developing or amending regulations. Specifically, the bill would direct the SEC to: :*Assess the significance of the problem the regulation is designed to address; :*Determine whether the estimated costs of the proposed regulation justify its estimated benefits; and :*Identify alternatives to the proposed regulation that are available. Further, under the bill, the SEC would be required to review its regulations every five years to determine whether they are outmoded, ineffective, or excessively burdensome. Using the results of the review, the agency would then need to consider modifying or repealing such rules. For major rules (that is, rules expected to have an economic impact greater than $100 million annually), the bill would require the SEC to develop and publish a plan to assess whether the regulation has achieved its stated purposes. H.R. 1062 would direct the agency, no later than two years after the date such a rule was published, to publish a report assessing the costs, benefits, and consequences of the rule using performance measures that were identified when the rule was adopted. Based on information from the SEC, CBO estimates that the commission would ultimately need 20 additional staff positions (less than a 1 percent increase in the agency’s 2012 staffing level) to handle the new rulemaking, reporting, and analytical activities required under the bill. CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 1062 would cost the SEC $23 million over the 2013–2018 period, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, for additional personnel and overhead expenses. Under current law, the SEC is authorized to collect fees sufficient to offset its annual appropriation; therefore, CBO estimates that the net budgetary effect of the SEC’s activities to implement H.R. 1062 would not be significant, assuming appropriation actions consistent with the commission’s authorities. Assuming that the SEC increases fees to offset the costs of implementing the additional regulatory activities required by the bill, H.R. 1062 would increase the cost of an existing mandate on private entities required to pay those fees. Based on information from the SEC, CBO estimates that the aggregate cost of the mandate would fall well below the annual threshold for private-sector mandates established in UMRA ($150 million in 2013, adjusted annually for inflation). Procedural history House The SEC Regulatory Accountability Act was introduced into the House on March 12, 2013 by Rep. Scott Garrett (R-NJ). It was then referred to the United States House Committee on Financial Services and the United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced on Friday May 10, 2013 that H.R. 1580 would be considered the following week. As of May 15, 2013, the bill had 23 co-sponsors, all of them Republicans. On May 17, 2013, the House voted in Roll Call Vote 160 to pass the bill 235-161. Seventeen Democrats voted in favor of the bill. Senate The SEC Regulatory Accountability Act was received in the Senate on May 20, 2013 and referred to the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Debate and discussion Republicans argued in favor of the bill as an important measure to improve the economy and prevent the SEC from overburdening private companies with regulation. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said \\"The American economy is hurting, and what we need is less government standing in the way of the private sector, not more.\\" Republicans also pointed to a 2011 court case in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia that struck down an SEC rule for failing to properly frame the benefits and costs of the rule. Democrats argued that this bill was designed to stop Dodd-Frank, a bill that made major regulatory reform to the American financial sector. Maxine Waters, the ranking Financial Services Committee member, said that \\"the purpose of this legislative effort is to stop implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act dead in its tracks.\\" On May 15, 2013, the President Obama released a Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 1062 in which he said that the Administration opposes passage of the bill. The Administration said that the analytical requirements added by the bill, such as the required cost-benefit analyses, \\"could result in unnecessary delays in the rulemaking process, thereby undermining the ability of the SEC to effectively execute its statutory mandates.\\" The statement did not threaten a veto. The statement did acknowledge that the bill was similar to an Executive Order already issued by the White House that would make similar requirements.
