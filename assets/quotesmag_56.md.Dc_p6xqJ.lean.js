The boat was not completed before the end of the war and was sold for scrap in 1934. Design and description The R-class submarine was designed to meet an Admiralty requirement for a specialised hunter-killer submarine with an emphasis on submerged performance. The boats had a length of overall, a beam of and a mean draft of . They displaced on the surface and submerged. The R-class submarines had a crew of 2 officers and 20 ratings.Gardiner & Gray, p. 93 They had a diving depth of .Harrison, Chapter 19 For surface running, the boats were powered by a single eight-cylinder Harrison, Chapter 25 diesel engine that drove the single propeller shaft. When submerged it was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the R class had a range of at and at submerged.Harrison, Chapter 10 The boats were armed with six 18-inch (45 cm) torpedo tubes in the bow. They carried six reload torpedoes for a grand total of a dozen torpedoes. They were equipped with an array of five hydrophones in the bow to allow them to locate and engage targets while submerged. Construction and career HMS R4 was laid down on 4 March 1917 at Chatham Dockyard, launched on 8 June 1918 and commissioned on 23 August 1919. She came too late to see any combat in World War I, like most of the other R-class submarines. Her shape resulted in her being nicknamed \\"The Slug\\". On 1 November 1926, R4 ran aground at Exmouth, Devon, England. She was refloated 10¬Ω hours later. R4 was the only boat to survive through to the 1930s. Additions to her casing produced slightly better sea keeping at the cost of a reduced speed from 15 knots submerged to 13 knots. She was used as a fast underwater target at the Portland anti-submarine school until 1934, then sold on 26 May 1934 to Young, Sunderland.

The RAE is ranked fourth in seniority of the corps of the Australian Army, behind the Staff Cadets, Armoured and Artillery Corps. The corps was formed by the amalgamation of the various colonial engineer corps of the states and territories of Australia in 1902 and since then has served in various conflicts including World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War. The corps has also served on numerous peacekeeping operations and was heavily involved in the Australian contribution to the war in Afghanistan. History The origins of the Royal Australian Engineers date back to 15 November 1860, when the Corps of Engineers was founded in the colony of Victoria by Peter Scratchley. By 1876, five of the six colonies‚ÄîNew South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia‚Äîhad raised their own engineer units. These were amalgamated on 1 July 1902 as the Corps of Engineers. At this time, the corps consisted of field, fortress, telegraph, electric and submarine mining companies.McNicol 1977, pp. 166‚Äì167. After Federation the small regular engineer component was granted the prefix \\"Royal\\"; however, the Militia remained part of the \\"Australian Engineers\\".Dennis et al. 2008, p. 464. In 1911, the Australian Corps of Signallers was absorbed into the Engineers as the RAE Signal Service. Four years later, in July 1915, all members of the Survey Section RAE, separated to form the Australian Survey Corps. During this period the School of Military Engineering was established at Moore Park in Sydney. During World War I there were approximately 40 engineering units raised as part of the First Australian Imperial Force. These units included field engineering units, tunneling companies, railway units and signalling squadrons which served at Gallipoli, the Sinai, Palestine, France and Belgium. Following the end of the war the School of Military Engineering was disbanded. On 1 January 1925 the RAE Signal Service was separated to form the Australian Corps of Signals. This was followed in 1932 by the Survey Section separating to form the Australian Survey Corps. The regular Permanent Force and reserve Citizen Military Forces (CMF) engineer units were brought together in January 1936 as the \\"Corps of Royal Australian Engineers\\". In 1939 the School of Military Engineering was re-established at Steele Barracks in Liverpool, New South Wales. Tarakan, 1945 During the inter-war years the RAE maintained a force of 233 regular troops and a militia force of 1,750. With the outbreak of World War II, however, the corps was expanded greatly, eventually reaching a peak of 32,984 men in 1945. RAE units of the Second Australian Imperial Force and militia served in North Africa, Malaya, New Guinea and Borneo campaigns. Following the end of the war the size of the corps was once again reduced. Nevertheless, the various units and sub-units of the RAE have been deployed on many overseas operations since 1945. During the Korean War there were no formed engineer units deployed by the Australian Army, although individual members of the RAE were deployed with the 1st Commonwealth Division. Later, RAE units deployed as part of the Australian commitment to the Malayan Emergency, Confrontation and the Vietnam War. They have also been deployed overseas to carry out construction work in New Guinea. During the Vietnam War the RAE maintained a force of about 1,000 personnel in South Vietnam where they served as part of the 1st Australian Task Force. Following the end of the war the size of the Australian Army was decreased in line with the abolition of the national service scheme and as a consequence of this and a number of lessons that came out of the deployment to Vietnam the RAE underwent a series of changes. One of the most significant changes came in 1972 and was the decision to establish full regimental sized engineer units, as opposed to squadron or company sized units. These units were initially known as Field Regiments, but have subsequently become known as Combat Engineer Regiments. As a part of this restructuring the RAE was reorganised to raise one regiment for each brigade and the Corps lost its responsibility for maintaining water transport and engineering stores. Since the late 1980s members of the Corps have been involved in combat and peacekeeping operations in Namibia, Rhodesia, Pakistan, Kurdistan, Cambodia, Somalia, Rwanda, Bougainville and Mozambique as Timor Leste, the Solomon Islands, Iraq and Afghanistan. On 1 July 1996 the RAE reabsorbed the Royal Australian Survey Corps. Corps titles Over the course of its existence, the corps has held the following titles: * July 1902 to September 1907 ‚Äì \\"Corps of Engineers\\" * September 1907 to January 1936 ‚Äì \\"Australian Engineers\\" * On 31 January 1936, the corps was given Royal Assent, and was subsequently renamed the \\"Royal Australian Engineers\\". Traditions=Motto= The motto of the Royal Australian Engineers is Ubique (Everywhere),Jobson 2009, p. 152. a motto shared with RAE's parent corps, the Royal Engineers. This motto was bestowed by King William IV in 1832 in recognition that both Sappers and Gunners were not entitled to carry Regimental Colours and typically served as small detachments instead of a whole unit. The original motto of the RAE, adopted at Federation was Facimus et Frangimus (We make and we break) and appeared on the engineer hat badge up until 1947 when it was replaced by Honi soit qui mal y pense. It now only appears on the Corps Cipher. The current engineer hat badge features a leather garter adorned with a crown and the motto Honi soit qui mal y pense (Evil be to him who evil thinks), mirroring the motto of the Order of the Garter.Jobson 2009, p. 126. This honour was awarded to the RAE in 1947 for their efforts during World War II. =Sappers= The Royal Australian Engineers also adopted the Royal Engineers practice of calling their private soldiers \\"Sappers\\", in recognition of the fact that the very earliest engineers had been primarily concerned with driving saps (tunnels) both towards the enemy lines, and underneath fortifications.Jobson 2009, p. 96. =Colours= Although the Corps does not carry official regimental colours such as those carried by infantry units, the basic Royal Australian Engineers colours are red (primary) and blue. Typically, however, unit colour patches, consist of a red feature on a purple field.Blackwell 2008, p. 64. The banner or flag depiction of the colours consists of a red field with two horizontal blue bands near the top and bottom of the field. This, in keeping with the Corps of Royal Engineers, represents two rivers shown in blue with the red background representing all the lives lost to achieve the crossing. If a unit title is shown it is shown in yellow. =Waterloo Dinner= The Waterloo Dinner is an annual dinner for commissioned officers held by units of the Royal Australian Engineers, although some smaller units may permit other ranks to attend. It is traditionally held on or about 18 June in commemoration of the first dinner, held by members of the corps at Gallipoli in 1915 to celebrate the completion of Watson's Pier at Anzac Cove. In recognition of the officer who led the construction of the pier, Lieutenant Stanley Watson, a signals officer within the Royal Australian Engineers an officer of the Royal Australian Signals Corps attends each dinner as a guest. The name Waterloo was used because the first dinner was observed on the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo.Jobson 2009, p. 98. Current roles The RAE provides combat engineering, construction and other technical support to the Australian Defence Force. Its main roles are to provide mobility and counter mobility capabilities to the Australian Army and its allies. This means enhancing the ability of friendly forces to move while denying movement to enemy forces. In order to provide these capabilities, engineers are required to conduct many tasks including penetrating minefields, locating and disarming booby traps, clearing unexploded ordnance, conducting explosive demolitions, purifying water, surveying, and building and maintaining roads, airfields and bridges. The Corps also performs the majority of the Australian Army's demolition tasks and is trained to fight as infantry if needed. Current structure An RAE sapper assigned to the International Stabilisation Force, Dili, Timor Leste, 2010 The corps has both Regular and Reserve units, which are situated across the country within the Army's three regular manoeuvre brigades - the 1st, 3rd and 7th Brigades - and within the Reserve 2nd Division.

Many of its engineers were refugees from the recently bankrupt New England Digital, makers of the highly regarded and much more pricey Synclavier music workstation. It was considered a very innovative product in its time for its intuitive touch-screen user- interface and very high performance. The Foundation 2000 cost approximately $60,000 when it was introduced and ended up not being successful in the market. Software updates were still being released as late as 1996. A cheaper version called the Fostex Foundation 2000RE was also sold. Among its most highly touted features was a hot-swappable SCSI drive enclosure (referred to as the RPE, or Removable Project Environment) that maintains the entire system state at all times, allowing one to immediately switch between different projects and always able to return where they left off, virtually instantaneously. Additionally, the Foundation 2000 editor could back up and restore projects from/to a SCSI tape drive in the background, while the user continued working with the system. A user operated the machine through the 'Edit Controller' which connected to the main unit with a 25' cable that attached to either the front or back of the main unit, or the controller can be affixed onto the front of the main unit. The Fostex Foundation 2000 was highly modular in that functionality could be added to the system by way of boards slid into the front or back of the main processing unit. On the back of the system, a variety of connectivity options were available such as analog audio, coaxial/XLR/toslink optical connectors for input and output, SCSI (for external hard drives or tape backup units), various sync sources (video/SMPTE/etc), MIDI, and RS-422 ports for remote controlling the Foundation 2000 from other devices, or using the it to control other devices. The front of the unit was limited to adding 'algorithmic computing engine' boards, basically DSPs devoted to routing sound between tracks and performing three-band EQ on each of the 16 tracks individually. Ports were provided for daisy chaining multiple Foundation 2000 units, but apparently no support was ever implemented. The system supports 24-bit audio processing but the standard analog inputs/outputs are handled by 18-bit DAC/ADCs (8x and 64x oversampling, respectively) and, at least with the original version of the firmware, recorded as 16-bit audio. Internally, the Foundation 2000 hardware is controlled by a Motorola 68030 CPU with a Motorola 68000 inside the Edit Controller to handle the touch-screen display and buttons. In addition to two Motorola 56002 DSPs, each a 40 MHz DSP that operates natively on 24-bit data, on the main CPU boards, the unit could be expanded by adding up to six \\"Algorithmic Computing Engine\\" Mix Processors boards, each containing four additional Motorola 56002 DSP processor. A fully loaded Foundation 2000 contains 26 of these programmable processors, however it is unclear what benefits are gained since the last revision of the software appears to only use them to for signal routing, stereo panning and three-band eq for the machine's 8 audio tracks. Originally the Foundation 2000 was announced by Fostex to their internal distributors at a distributor meeting but only after all distributors had signed an agreement of confidentiality, as all was top- secret at that time. The sales of the Foundation 2000 was independent of the normal sales from Japan as it was Fostex USA that handled the sales of this product.

He was born at Killinghall, Harrogate, Yorkshire.  Biography  Clarkson was a right-handed opening batsman and off break bowler, and played his early cricket for the Harrogate Club, for whom he opened both the batting and the bowling. After first playing for the Yorkshire Second XI in 1958, he made his debut for his native county in 1963, playing when the Test stars were away. He moved to Somerset in 1966 and played until 1971, winning his Somerset cap in 1968. Clarkson's father had been a league professional for Rothwell C.C. in the Leeds League before World War II. In 110 matches he scored 4,458 runs at 25.18, with two centuries and a best of 131 for an average of 25.18. He took 13 wickets at 28.25. He played 50 one day games, scoring 752 runs with a best of 102* at 16.93, and taking two wickets. He played for several clubs as a professional until 1991, when he retired aged 51. He had five successful years in the North Yorkshire-South Durham league, scoring more than 1,000 runs each season and, in the Bradford League, playing for Windhill, he was second only to Vinoo Mankad in their aggregate run scores. After retiring from the field he became an umpire, joining the first- class circuit in 1996. Clarkson spent the 1980s in the Harrogate area, employed as Customer Services Manager for Yorkshire Water.

Co-chaperones are the non-client binding molecules that assist in protein folding mediated by Hsp70 and Hsp90. They are particularly essential in stimulation of the ATPase activity of these chaperone proteins. There are a great number of different co-chaperones however based on their domain structure most of them fall into two groups: J-domain proteins and tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR). Co-chaperones assist heat shock proteins in the protein folding process. These co-chaperones can function in a number of ways. Primarily co-chaperones are involved in the ATPase functionality of their associated heat shock proteins. Co-chaperones catalyze the hydrolysis ATP to ADP on their respective chaperones which then allows them undergo a large conformational change that allows them to either bind to their substrates with higher affinity or aid in the release of the substrate following protein folding, as in the case of co-chaperone p23. J-proteins, DnaJ or Hsp40 are important co-chaperones for Hsp70 and have the ability to bind to polypeptides and then recruit chaperone protein DnaK and passes the polypeptide along to this chaperone by catalyzing ATP hydrolysis that allows DnaK to bind to the unfolded polypeptide with high affinity. Another co- chaperone, GrpE, comes in following the folding of this protein to cause a conformational change in DnaK that allows it to release the folded protein. The mechanism of TPR proteins is less studied these domains have been shown to interact with Hsp90 and Hsp70 and may be involved in the creation of an Hsp70-Hsp90 multi-chaperone complex. Co-chaperones may also play an important role in misfolding diseases such as cystic fibrosis. An interaction between Hsp90 and its co-chaperone, Aha1, is essential to the proper folding of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Other examples of co- chaperone's role in illness include neurodegenerative diseases. Alzheimer‚Äôs and Parkinson‚Äôs disease have a number of proteins that can aggregate if not properly chaperoned. Co-chaperones CSPŒ± (DNAJC5), auxilin (DNAJC6) and RME-8 (DNAJC13) are important for preserving folding and assembly, therefore preventing protein aggregation. Detection of mutations in these proteins have been associated with the early onset of neurodegenerative diseases.

Sariputta and Moggallana (also called Maha Moggallana) were the two chief disciples of the Buddha, often stylized as the right hand and left hand disciples of the Buddha respectively. The two disciples were childhood friends who ordained under the Buddha together and are said to have become enlightened as arahants. The Buddha declared them his two chief disciples, after which they assumed leadership roles in the Buddha's ministry. Both of the chief disciples died a few months before the Buddha near the ancient Indian city of RƒÅjagaha and were cremated. According to Buddhist texts, the cremated remains of the disciples were then enshrined in stupas at notable monasteries of the time, with Sariputta's remains being enshrined at Jetavana monastery and Moggallana's remains being enshrined at Ve·∏∑uvana monastery. However, as of 1999 no modern archaeological reports had confirmed this, although in 1851 discoveries were made at other sites. In 1851, British archaeologists Major Alexander Cunningham and Captain Fredrick Maisey discovered relics attributed to the chief disciples during excavations of stupas in the Indian cities of Sanchi and Satdhara. Scholars have theorized that the relics were enshrined in stupas near Rajagaha after the disciples' deaths but were redistributed by later Indian kings such as King Asoka. Following the discovery, the Satdhara relics were sent to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in 1866, while the Sanchi relics are said to have been lost when a ship carrying the remains sank. Following a Buddhist revival movement in South Asia in the late 19th century, Buddhist organizations including the Maha Bodhi Society began pressuring the British government to return the relics to Asia so they can be properly venerated, with the British government eventually conceding. The relics were sent to Sri Lanka in 1947, where they were on display at the Colombo Museum for nearly two years, and then were put on tour around parts of Asia starting in 1949. The relics were then divided up and permanently relocated in 1952, with portions being enshrined at the Kaba Aye Pagoda in Yangon, Burma, the Maha Bodhi Society temple in Colombo, Sri Lanka, and the Chethiyagiri Vihara in Sanchi, India. 263x263px  Sariputta and Moggallana  184x184px Sariputta and Moggallana were considered to have been the two chief disciples of the Buddha. Sariputta was considered the disciple who was foremost in wisdom and Moggallana was considered the disciple who was foremost in psychic powers. Buddhist texts relate that Sariputta and Moggallana were childhood friends who became spiritual wanderers in their youth. After having searched for spiritual truth under different contemporary masters, they came into contact with the teachings of the Buddha and ordained as monks under him, after which the Buddha declared the friends his two chief disciples, together described in the MahƒÅpadƒÅna Sutta, as \\"the chief pair of disciples, the excellent pair\\" (Pali: sƒÅvakayuga·πÅ agga·πÅ bhaddayuga·πÅ). Texts describe that the two friends became arahants and played a key leadership role in the Buddha's ministry, including being tasked with the training of the Buddha's other disciples. Sariputta was considered the Buddha's right hand disciple, while Moggallana was considered his left hand disciple. According to Buddhist texts, Sariputta and Moggallana both died a few months before the Buddha. Accounts of Sariputta's death state that he died peacefully in his hometown and was cremated in the city of RƒÅjagaha. Sariputta's assistant, Cunda, then brought his relics to the Buddha in Savatthi, where they were enshrined in a stupa at Jetavana monastery. Accounts of Moggallana's death state that he died violently, dying after being beaten by a group of bandits in a cave near RƒÅjagaha. Buddhist texts state that Moggallana's relics were then collected and enshrined in the Ve·∏∑uvana monastery near RƒÅjagaha. Over the succeeding centuries reports from Chinese pilgrims such as Xuanzang indicated that the relics could be found in the Indian city of Mathura in stupas built by Emperor Asoka. Excavation of the lost relics alt= As of 1999, no archaeological reports had confirmed findings of the relics of the chief disciples at the sites mentioned by either Chinese pilgrims or Buddhist texts. However, a 19th century British excavation did result in the discovery of relics attributed to the chief disciples in other locations. =Sanchi relics= In 1851, British archaeologists Major Alexander Cunningham and Captain Fredrick Maisey were exploring a site in Sanchi, near Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh in India, which was known for its many Buddhist stupas, also called \\"Topes\\", dating back to the 3rd century BCE. Attempts to excavate the stupas had been done in the past by Sir Thomas Herbert Maddock, who breached the outside of the stupas but was unable to reach the center. Cunningham and Maisey instead excavated the sites by going in perpendicular through the middle of the stupas, allowing them to successfully open and explore several stupas in Sanchi. During the expedition, Cunningham and Maisey excavated Stupa number 3 of the site and discovered an undisturbed chamber with two sandstone boxes. Each of the boxes contained a steatite casket containing human bone fragments. The lids of the boxes bore BrƒÅhmƒ´ script, the southern box bore the inscription Sariputasa, meaning \\"(relics) of Sariputta\\", while the lid of the northern box bore the inscription Maha Mogalanasa meaning \\"(relics) of Maha Moggallana\\", identifying the bone fragments as belonging to the two chief disciples. The relative positioning of the boxes also had religious significance. Cunningham states that alt= According to Cunningham, people in ancient India sat facing the east during religious ceremonies and even used the word east (para) for \\"front\\", as well as the word south (dakshina) for \\"right\\" and the word north (vami) for \\"left\\", meaning the positioning of Sariputta's casket toward the south and Moggallana's casket toward the north symbolized each disciple's relative positions as right and left hand disciple respectively. This positioning has also been explained by the fact that the Buddha traditionally sat facing the east, which would make the south his right hand side, and the north his left hand side. Satdhara stupas and the inscribed caskets of Sariputta and Moggallana294x294pxalt= The box attributed to Sariputta contained a round white steatite casket, more than six inches in diameter and three inches in height. The surface was polished and hard, and the box is believed to have been turned on a lathe. Surrounding the casket were two pieces of sandalwood, which Cunningham believed was from Sariputta's funeral pyre. Inside the casket was one single bone fragment nearly one inch long, and seven beads made up of precious stones and metals. The box attributed to Moggallana contained a slightly smaller steatite casket made up of a slightly softer substance. Inside the casket were two bone fragments, the larger one being nearly half an inch long. Each of the caskets had an ink BrƒÅhmƒ´ character inscribed on the inner surface of the lid: the BrƒÅhmƒ´ character \\"Sa\\" (ëÄ≤ëÄ∏) on the casket attributed to Sariputta and the BrƒÅhmƒ´ character \\"Ma\\" (ëÄ´) on the casket attributed to Mahamoggallana. According to Cunningham, the ink inscriptions were possibly the oldest ink writings in existence. =Satdhara relics= Following the discovery in Sanchi, Cunningham and Maisey excavated several nearby sites. During an excavation at the city of Satdhara a few miles west, the archaeologists found another pair of steatite relic caskets at Satdhara's Stupa Number 2, one of a group that was locally called the \\"Buddha Bhita\\" or \\"Buddha Monuments\\". The caskets were smaller than the Sanchi ones, about three inches in diameter and two inches in height, and each contained several human bone fragments. According to Cunningham, there was evidence that the stupa had been opened before and concluded that villagers had opened it and then closed it up after finding nothing but bone fragments. Inside the lids of the caskets were inscriptions like those in Sanchi, Sariputasa meaning \\"(relics) of Sariputta\\" and Maha Mogalanasa meaning \\"(relics) of Maha Moggallana\\". The only notable difference between these inscriptions and the ones in Sanchi was the positioning of a BrƒÅhmƒ´ vowel, which Cunningham believed was due either to the inscription being done by a different engraver or being done at a different time period. Cunningham theorized that the relics were enshrined in stupas near Rajagaha after the disciples' deaths until the time of Emperor Asoka, who then redistributed them in stupas throughout India. Scholars have also theorized that a Sunga king may have also done a similar redistribution and built stupas such as the one in Sanchi to enshrine them. Cunningham and Maisey spent several months excavating numerous stupas in the area, but they didn't make any more finds as significant as the findings in Sanchi and Satdhara. Display in Britain Victoria & Albert Museum in 1873, then called the South Kensington Museumalt= Cunningham and Maisey later divided their findings among each other, with Maisey bringing the SatdhƒÅra relics to Britain and loaning them to the Victoria and Albert Museum (then called the South Kensington Museum) in London in 1866 along with several other artifacts from Asia. The relics were eventually purchased by the Museum in 1921 from Maisley's son, whose ownership devolved. Cunningham brought his findings to Britain on two ships, one of which sank, thus the Sanchi relics are assumed to have been lost. Historian Torkel Brekke, however, argues that Maisey took all the relics with him, and thus the Sanchi relics went to Britain along with the SatdhƒÅra ones. Archeologist Louis Finot notes that Cunningham had no interest in the relics, only in the caskets. In the late 19th century, a Buddhist revival movement led by the Maha Bodhi Society began taking place in South Asia. The revival efforts led several Buddhist organizations to begin pressuring the British government starting in the 1920s to return the relics of the chief disciples to India, where they can be properly venerated. The Victoria and Albert Museum rejected the initial requests, which at first came as a series of letters from local English Buddhists. On one occasion, the museum instead offered to allow a small group of local Buddhists to worship the relics at the museum, in response to a request that the relics temporarily be sent to a local Buddhist center for a worship. The museum argued that it also held Christian relics, and that returning the Buddhist relics would result in many museums being forced to return other relics as well. The situation changed in 1939 however, when the museum was informed that the government of India had forwarded a request for the return of the relics on behalf of Buddhist organizations. While museum director Eric Maclagan still argued that doing so would result in being forced to also return their Christian relics, one museum official argued that Britain being a Christian country gives them rights to those relics that they don't have with Buddhist relics. The museum was eventually instructed by the British government to return the relics for diplomatic reasons later that year. However, the transfer was delayed due to the outbreak of World War II, due to fear of the relics being lost in wartime transport. After the war ended, the transfer was officially made in 1947 with the relics first being transported to predominantly Buddhist Sri Lanka in accordance with an agreement made with Buddhist organizations. Tour of Asia The National Museum of Colombo (then just called the Colombo Museum), where the relics resided for nearly two years after being returned by the British Following the transfer of the relics from the British, they were put on display at the Colombo Museum (now called the National Museum of Colombo) in Sri Lanka, where they were visited by an estimated two million people across different faiths. The Victoria and Albert Museum originally transferred the relics in plaster casket copies, but after the High Commissioner of India made a request for the original caskets in 1948 the museum transferred the original caskets to Sri Lanka as well. The relics remained in Sri Lanka for nearly two years before being transported to Calcutta, India in 1949, where they were formally received by Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and officially handed over to the Maha Bodhi Society of India. They were housed at the Dharmarajika Vihara, the headquarters of the Society, for two weeks where they received a constant stream of visitors, many of which Hindu and Muslim. The relics were then put on tour around northern India. In 1950 the relics were sent to Burma for a two month visit. The relics were received in the Burmese city of Rangoon, coinciding with the arrival of other Buddhist relics from Sri Lanka. According to reports of the occasion, most of the city had turned out for the arrival of the relics and the relics received a constant stream of visiting devotees for the month that they were in the city. In the second month of the visit, the relics were put on tour around Burma in a river tour that drew large crowds at the stops, including people from neighboring villages. One thing that was well reported in Burmese news was the visitation of the relics to areas of ethnic minorities, where they were also enthusiastically received. The relics were also taken for exposition in Nepal, Tibet and Cambodia. Re-enshrinement= Burma = alt= Following the tour of the relics in Burma in 1950, Burmese Prime Minister U Nu asked India for a portion of the relics for Burma to keep permanently. Later that year, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru agreed to make a \\"permanent loan\\" of a portion of the relics to Burma in what was seen as a gesture of goodwill toward its newly independent neighbor. Burma's portion of the relics arrived from Calcutta in 1951, on the same day as some relics from the Buddha himself. Like the first visit, they were received by a large crowd and were put on tour around the Burma. The relics were then housed in a shrine near Botatuang Pagoda, which was destroyed in World War II and was being reconstructed. Although the Burmese government originally intended to house the relics at the Botatuang Pagoda after reconstruction, following the completion of the Kaba Aye Pagoda in 1952, Prime Minister U Nu decided to permanently house them at the Kaba Aye Pagoda in Yangon instead. = Sri Lanka = Sri Lanka also obtained a portion of the relics, which were brought from Sanchi in 1952 and kept at the temple of the Maha Bodhi Society in Colombo. The relics are exhibited annually during the local celebration of the Buddha's birthday, Vesak Day. In 2015, the Maha Bodhi Society broke with tradition by showing the relics to Pope Francis outside of the duration of the annual festival. Responding to critics, the head of the society stated that no pope had set foot inside a Buddhist temple since 1984, and added that \\"religious leaders have to play a positive role to unite [their] communities instead of dividing\\". = India = The portion of the relics that stayed in India were also enshrined in 1952, at the Chethiyagiri Vihara in Sanchi, which was built by the Maha Bodhi Society specifically to house the relics. The vihara was funded in part by a donation from the Nawab of Bhopal as well as a land grant from the local Bhopal government. The relics are shown every year at the annual international Buddhist festival in November. In 2016, the exhibition was visited by Thai princess Sirindhorn.  Legacy  alt= Brekke calls the return of the relics of Sariputta and Moggallana to Asia the greatest achievement and \\"the most significant historical point of reference\\" of the Maha Bodhi Society of India, matched only by the role the society played in the return of relics of the Buddha himself. The relics were received in India in a massive ceremony and their retrieval was highly celebrated. According to Brekke, Indian Prime Minister Nehru saw Buddhism as a peaceful and unifying force for India and the relics of the chief disciples were seen as a symbol of the newly independent country's values of religious tolerance and non- violence. In various speeches made at the receiving ceremony for the relics, speakers made comparisons between Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi and the Buddha. According to art historian Jack Daulton, the visit of the relics to Burma played a significant political role in Burma as well. The newly independent Burmese state promoted a revival of Buddhism in the country, which at the time was dealing with widespread civil strife. The relics helped establish the new Burmese government's legitimacy and had a unifying effect on the country. After the relics visited Burma, Burmese Prime Minister U Nu stated that \\"at every place where the relics have been exhibited, most of all in the neighborhoods of disturbed areas, public morale greatly improved.\\" Brekke argues that the story of the relics showed a dynamic between archaeology and politics. In the view of curators at the Victoria and Albert Museum, as well as that of Maisey and Cunningham, the relics of Sariputta and Moggallana had only artistic and historical value, and in that world there was \\"no place for the religious use of relics\\", states Brekke. Daulton describes the story of the relics and their influence on various governments as \\"amazing\\" given that they were just tiny bone fragments, stating that: \\"those tiny pieces of bone moved not only millions of devotees worldwide, but national governments as well\\".

It originally aired on ABC on 16 October 1965. The episode was directed by Sidney Hayers and written by Philip Levene. Plot Hammond, a middle-aged man, is attacked at home by an unseen intruder who forces his way through the door with the force of a battering ram and appears to be immune to bullets. Steed and Mrs Peel investigate. The intruder strikes again, this time a businessman named Lambert in his office, smashing his way in the same way. On the scene, Mrs Peel notices the way Lambert's neck has been broken without bruising to the face by the angle of the head and surmises that he was killed by a type of advanced karate blow known as inku, of which there are very few expert exponents in Europe. Lambert's company, like Hammond's, is on a list of firms competing for the European rights to Japanese businessman Mr Tusamo's new circuit elements that will replace the transistor. Mrs Peel visits a karate dojo seeking an inku specialist and is lectured by the bald sensei. After Mrs Peel proves her skill by defeating the female karate student Oyuka (\\"the immovable one\\"), the sensei allows her to join the dojo. Steed, in place of Lambert, visits Tusamo. Mrs Peel visits Jephcott Products, a toy factory that specializes in manufacturing electronic toys. At the karate dojo, Oyama (\\"the tall mountain\\"), a 5th dan at judo and a 4th dan at karate, demonstrates his skill to a packed room, and fits the description of the tall killer, by his height and explosive strike. Mrs Peel recognizes the man as Jephcott, the head of the toy company. Steed visits United Automation and meets the wheelchair-bound ex-ministry scientist Dr. Clement Armstrong, owner of the factory. After Steed explains his interest in computers, Armstrong's sidekick Benson contacts the scientist via two-way videophone and mentions that someone replaced Lambert at Tusamo's office. Armstrong shows his visitor to Benson, who recognizes Steed as the false Lambert. Armstrong gives Steed a parting gift: a gadget pen containing solid ink which liquefies only in the heat of the hand, thus reducing the danger of leaks. Steed and Mrs Peel visit the toy factory and discover that Jephcott has been killed by something with the force of a ten-ton truck, leaving a hole in the wall in the shape of a tall man. Steed revisits United Automation, this time covertly, and discovers that Armstrong has been using a robot Cybernaut named Roger to kill off his rivals for the Tusamo concession. The Cybernaut is programmed via computer to home in on a radio transmitter concealed in the gadget pen given to Steed ‚Äì the same method used to kill Hammond, Lambert and Jephcott. But Steed's pen is in the possession of Mrs Peel, so the Cybernaut will attack her rather than Steed. Dr. Armstrong discovers Steed is an intruder in the building when the thermostat in the factory is altered. Steed attempts to phone Mrs Peel to warn her but, before the Cybernaut arrives, she leaves her flat to look for him at United Automation as Steed has not returned at the pre-arranged time. Steed is then attacked by another Cybernaut in the factory and presented to Armstrong. Mrs Peel arrives at Armstrong's factory, with the Cybernaut still following the pen she carries. Steed escapes and enters the warehouse room in which the Cybernaut has cornered Mrs Peel, and tells Mrs Peel to throw him the pen. Another Cybernaut (the first with a \\"brain of its own\\") arrives with Armstrong. Steed plants the pen on the second Cybernaut and they attack each other and accidentally kill Armstrong as he attempts to stop his robots. Roger, the first Cybernaut, then destroys the other by smashing its \\"brain\\" out of its head and destroys the pen. Having completed its mission it becomes inert, and Mrs. Peel pushes it over with a finger.

He is a forward, the only man to have ever scored more than 1000 goals in the sport and who has broken several other records as an individual and as part of Kingussie's record-breaking first team. The media has awarded him the nickname \\"Ronaldo of the Glens\\" in tribute to his scoring prowess, drawing comparisons with the famous Brazilian footballer. Everyone in shinty just calls him \\"Ronald\\". Early playing career and prime Ross made his first Camanachd Cup appearance in 1992 against Fort William as a substitute. His father, Ian Ross, was manager that day, and had not put him in the team due to worries about nepotism. However, Ross soon began to prove his worth throughout the nineties as Kingussie swept all before them. In 2002‚Äì03, the last ever winter season for shinty, he scored 94 goals in all competitions. This was more than the accumulated totals for Kingussie's closest rivals, Newtonmore Camanachd Club and Fort William Shinty Club in the league that season. His previous best, in season 2001‚Äì02, was 88. Ross retired from international shinty for the second time on 14 October 2007 after helping Scotland defeat the Irish hurlers in Fort William. He finished the 2007 season, where he helped Kingussie reclaim the Premier League title, with 72 goals. 2008 saw Ross again help Kingussie win the title but he was the victim of strong handed tactics by Fort William Shinty Club in the Camanachd Cup final that year. He scored a fantastic goal, akin to one scored in 2006 at the final in Dunoon but the treatment he received from Adam Robertson was very physical. Return to international and 1000 goals Ross returned to International shinty/hurling in 2009 after a call from the management of the Scotland side due to his form in the 2009 season which saw him score 92 goals, two short of his all-time record. Kingussie reclaimed the league with a last day win against Kyles Athletic. In 2010, after scoring 4 goals to win the Macaulay Cup in extra time, Ross stated that he would review his playing career at the end of the season. His career total, excluding goals in reserve shinty, is in excess of 1000 goals. On 23 May 2009 he scored his 1000th goal (and 1001st) against Lovat in a MacTavish Cup Semi-final. As well as captaining Scotland, he has popularised the wearing of safety helmets amongst young players. He is employed as a shinty development officer by the Camanachd Association. Ross was appointed under-21 Scotland manager for 2012. Recognition He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to shinty. Ronald was awarded the Glenfiddich Spirit of Scotland Award for Sport in 2009, the second time he had received this honour. Prowess in tennis He was Scottish junior tennis champion and was Scottish Number Two at youth level and is friends with Andy Murray. In early 2010, he was ironically injured by tripping on a tennis ball whilst coaching children shinty. Newtonmore connections In 2010, Ross was the victim of an April Fool's prank by a shinty website which stated that he would be switching to Kingussie's bitter rivals Newtonmore for his final season in the sport. Ironically, given his iconic status as the Kingussie player par excellence of the last 20 years, Ronald's mother is from Newtonmore. Also his maternal grandfather, Minto Sellar, won the Camanachd Cup for Newtonmore in 1931. His father, Ian, from Kingussie, was a massive influence on his career. He also has a brother, Ian Jr. Ian was also awarded the MBE for services to shinty.

He founded several parties, which focused on fighting for electoral reform through referendums. He is the son of the politician Antonio Segni, one time President of the Republic of Italy.  Biography  Segni was born May 16, 1939 in Sassari, Sardinia. He was born to Antonio Segni, himself a prominent politician, and Laura Carta Caprino, who would have a total of four children. Prior to his political career Segni studied law at the University of Sassari, following in the footsteps of his father, Antonio Segni. = Academic career = Following his graduation he would move to Padau where he would work under Luigi Carraro, a four-time Christian Democrat Senator, and teach at university. In 1975 he would become a professor of civil law at the University of Sassari. He would go on to become the chair of the Faculty of Law there, while being an active politician, until his retirement in 2011. = Christian Democrats = A long-time member of Christian Democracy, like his father, he was first elected Regional Councillor in 1967. Shortly after gaining his position at the University, Segni would run for the national parliament in 1976. He would come in second place behind Francesco Cossiga with 85,736 votes but still win a seat. He would continue to hold this office until 1996. He served as State Secretary of the Ministry Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies in the second Craxi government and in the sixth Fanfani government. He was also chairman of the Control Committee for Information and Security Services and for State Secrecy from 1987 to 1991. = Election Reform and Starting a Party = Riding the momentum from the 1991 Italian electoral law referendum, which he supported, Segni would contribute to the establishment of the Democratic Alliance in 1992. He would also found the Populars for Reform that same year, with the goal of electoral reform; transitioning from proportional representation to a first-past-the-post system. These reforms would ultimately culminate in 1993 under the Mattarellum law which he claimed would bring stability to Italy by making it more similar to Anglo-Saxon democracies. In 1993 Segni would finally break from the Christian Democrats who were suffering from tangentopoli while he served in the XI legislature. During this time he would found the Segni Pact in March 1994 from the remains of the previous Democratic Alliance and Populars for Reform. Segni had hoped to capitalize on the political vacuum left by the now tainted Christian Democrats. Patto Segni logo (1994) He was a candidate for Prime Minister for the centrist alliance Pact for Italy (composed of Mino Martinazzoli's Italian People's Party and the Segni Pact) in 1994, and as an MEP from 1994 to 1995 which he won. The party as a whole, however, did not have much initial success and joined the Anti-Berlusconi coalition during the first Berlusconi government. During his first tenure in the European Parliament he would join the European People's Party along with several other members of the Segni Pact Danilo Poggiolini, Vincenzo Viola, and Livio Filippi. He would also be part of the European Parliament's delegation to the Arab Maghreb Union. His party would go on to join with the Italian Renewal List while he began refocusing on teaching. In 1999 Mario Segni returned to the domestic political scene, attempting to abolish proportional quotas via referendum. Despite failure to do so, in the 1999 European election the Sengi Pact co-federated with the National Alliance creating the Segni Pact ‚Äì National Alliance list, a coalition also known as the 'elephant' headed by Gianfranco Fini He would also go on to win a second term as an MEP where he would vote alongside the Union for Europe of the Nations. During this tenure, he would serve on the Committee of Constitutional Affairs, the delegation to MERCOSUR, and act as Vice-Chair for the delegation to Central America and Mexico. In 2003 he rebranded the Segni Pact, combining forces with Carlo Scognamiglio and former Segni Pact member's the Sardinian Reformers, naming it the Pact of Liberal Democrats; it would continue to criticize the Berlusconi camp. This would culminate in his siding 'no' on the 2006 Constitutional Referendum. During the 2006 election for the Presidency of the Italian Senate, Segni would support Franco Marini over former Christian Democrat head Giulio Andreotti, citing a respect for the old regime but a desire to see more progress in Italian politics and a fear of a return to the corruption prior to the Mani Pulite investigation. In early 2007 he became Coordinator of the Promoting Committee of the Electoral Referendum, led by Giovanni Guzzetta. This would place Segni alongside politicians such as Gianni Alemanno, Angelino Alfano, Mercedes Bresso, Riccardo Illy, Renato Brunetta, Antonio Martino, Giovanna Melandri, Arturo Parisi, Daniele Capezzone, Stefania Prestigiacomo, Gaetano Quagliariello, and Giorgio Tonini in the fight for a majority based electoral system. On July 24 of 2007 Segni handed over 800,000 signatures to the Court of Cassation for the presentation of the Electoral Referendum. The 2009 Italian electoral law referendum, took place in June 2009, but did not reach the required quorum. = Post-Politics = He has since left politics but continuous to provide commentary on it as a well known figure. In 2018, he was interviewed on the developments of Italian politics as shown here where he lists his opinions on the developments regarding the Northern League and the 5 Star Movement. He also gave his views on the push to return to a proportional representation system in Italy, claiming that \\"the memory of Italy is short.\\" Mario Segni is also the current president of the Antonio Segni Foundation, which seeks to put all his father's work online.  Legacy  While Segni's party was not electorally successful he is still known for his work through referendums. His work targeting the electoral system through referendums have been described as \\"contributing to the collapse of the established political system\\" of the first republic. While he was not entirely electorally successful, he is considered to have had success via the referendum process and characterized as having been one of the most powerful politicians of Italy at his peak. He has criticized prominent politicians in Italy like Berlusconi and movements within the country.

The massacre was carried out after the unit was ordered to abandon the village before the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska ‚Äì HV) recaptured the area in Operation Papuk-91. All the victims were local Croats, save one Serb, who had tried to protect his neighbours. Gunfire was the leading cause of death, though some of the victims were killed with axes or chainsaws, or were burned to death. The victims exhibited signs of torture and were left unburied. On the night of 13‚Äì14 December, the White Eagles dynamited a 550-year-old church in the village. The HV secured Voƒáin on the night of 14/15 December, the Serb population having left the previous night. Afterwards, Croatian soldiers torched many homes belonging to the Serbs who had once inhabited the village. The area was toured shortly afterwards by then-US Congressman Frank McCloskey, who publicised the killings at a news conference held in Zagreb the next day, calling them genocide. He persuaded Dr. Jerry Blaskovich, an Associate Clinical Professor at the University of Southern California Los Angeles County Hospital Medical Center to take part in the investigation of the killings. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) later charged Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá with the killings and Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj with the deportation of non-Serbs from Voƒáin. In 2015, the International Court of Justice ruled that the massacre in Voƒáin was not an example of genocide, and stated that Croatia has not produced sufficient evidence to substantiate its claim that Croats were killed by Serb forces in that locality in December 1991. Background Within the 1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia, the 5th (Banja Luka) Corps of the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija ‚Äì JNA) was tasked with advancing north through western Slavonia, from Okuƒçani to Daruvar and Virovitica, and with a secondary drive from Okuƒçani towards Kutina. This task was essentially consistent with the line expected to be reached by the main thrust of the JNA advancing from eastern Slavonia in about a week. The linkup was designed to facilitate a further advance west to Zagreb and Vara≈ædin. The JNA was stopped by the Croatian National Guard (Zbor Narodne Garde ‚Äì ZNG) between Novska, Nova Gradi≈°ka and Pakrac, although SAO Western Slavonia Territorial Defense Forces (Teritorijalna odbrana ‚Äì TO) units took positions on the Bilogora and Papuk north of Pakrac, near Virovitica and Slatina with no JNA support. The TO was supported by Serbian paramilitaries deploying to the village of Voƒáin on the Papuk Mountain in October. The paramilitaries were the White Eagles under the control of Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj. He visited Voƒáin in the following month and incited the paramilitaries to persecute the Croat population. According to testimonies of surviving residents of Voƒáin, the White Eagles and several local Serbs terrorised the Croat population, reduced to 80 by late 1991. Prior to the war, ethnic Serbs formed eighty percent of the village's population. On 29 October, the ZNG launched Operation Hurricane-91 against positions held by the JNA and the TO near Novska and Nova Gradi≈°ka, and Operation Swath-10 against the TO positions on the Bilogora Mountain south of Virovitica. Aiming to exploit the success of Operation Swath-10 and recapture Papuk area, Croatian forces, renamed the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska or HV) on 3 November, launched Operation Papuk-91 on 28 November. Killings Church of the Pilgrimage to the Blessed Virgin Mary in Voƒáin, rebuilt after the war The HV began advancing in the area of ƒêulovac, located approximately west of Voƒáin, on 12 December, and the TO were forced to retreat from the area. In turn, the White Eagles were to abandon Voƒáin, but were ordered to take no prisoners. They were also instructed to ensure the evacuation of the Serb population. Those who refused to leave were threatened and one man was killed in front of his home. The killing of civilians living in Voƒáin and two nearby smaller villages began on 13 December at noon. The White Eagles infantry, supported by at least one tank, moved through Voƒáin bombing Croat-owned houses and killing civilians. The killings and the destruction took twelve hours and claimed the lives of 43 civilians. The bodies of the victims were mutilated and left on display, presumably as a warning to others, outside Voƒáin itself, to flee or perish. All the victims were Croat civilians, except one 77-year- old Serb who had tried to protect his neighbours from the paramilitaries. Most of the victims were elderly, including twelve women aged 56‚Äì76 and eleven men aged 60‚Äì84. Many of those killed were tortured, beaten using chains and burned. Most of the victims were killed by gunshots, but the cause of death proved hard to establish for eight victims whose bodies were severely burned. A couple was bound with chains and burned alive, two women were killed using axes or similar sharp objects, one of them by several axe blows to her head. Another couple was beheaded and their heads were placed in bags. The Serb civilian who attempted to protect the others was also beaten, tortured using lighted cigarettes and heated chains, and then flayed. At 3:00 a.m., the paramilitaries demolished the Roman Catholic church of the Pilgrimage to the Blessed Virgin Mary in Voƒáin. They used the 550-year-old structure as an ammunition depot. In the wake of the explosion, a single wall of the structure remained standing. It is estimated that several tons of explosives were used for the purpose. At the same time, approximately 20 other Croat inhabitants of villages of Bokane, Kra≈°koviƒá, Miokoviƒáevo and Zveƒçevo, further to the south, were reportedly killed. Aftermath The HV captured Voƒáin on the night of 14/15 December, the village's Serb population having withdrawn the night before. Afterwards, Croatian soldiers torched many homes that belonged to the Serbs who had once inhabited the village. One of the first to arrive in the village following its re-capture was McCloskey, in Croatia on a fact-finding mission. McCloskey asked an aide to arrange a press conference in Zagreb the next day, while the aide persuaded Dr. Jerry Blaskovich, an Associate Clinical Professor at the LAC+USC Medical Center, sent to Croatia to investigate alleged use of chemical weapons, to take part in the investigation of the killings. At the conference, McCloskey called the killings genocide. CNN reporter Mark Dalmish refused to attend the press conference as the network mistrusted reports of the killings, and reportedly only became interested in the event once Blaskovich's involvement was announced. The victims' bodies were taken to the nearby town of Slatina for forensic examination on 17 December. Mackley contacted Croatian authorities and obtained permission to document the autopsies of the victims, but was denied access by authorities in Slatina. Mackley telephoned Croatian Defence Minister Gojko ≈†u≈°ak asking him to intervene on his behalf, but the local police allegedly disobeyed ≈†u≈°ak. The special police was deployed to Slatina to enforce ≈†u≈°ak's order to cooperate, almost causing an armed clash over the issue. To settle matters, a team was sent to Slatina by Zagreb University's Institute for Forensic Medicine to perform autopsies, retrieve bodies and perform the rest of the procedures in Zagreb. Survivors who took shelter in basements or cornfields, as well as a captured member of the paramilitary forces, later testified about the killings and identified the White Eagles as the perpetrators. In addition, the withdrawing paramilitaries left critical evidence behind, including personnel records, which confirmed that the force had been White Eagles associated with ≈†e≈°elj. An American war crimes investigator for the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Special Agent John Cencich, corroborated the information in an interview with a high-level inside witness linking Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, then president of Serbia to the killings. The ICTY charged Milo≈°eviƒá with the deaths of 32 civilians in Voƒáin. Milo≈°eviƒá was subsequently arrested and tried, but he died before his trial was completed. The ICTY also charged ≈†e≈°elj with involvement in the forced deportation of non-Serb civilians from Voƒáin. ≈†e≈°elj was ultimately acquitted of all charges. In March 2014, Croatia alleged before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that the massacre in Voƒáin was part of a larger campaign of genocide targeting the Croat population of Slavonia. In 2015, the ICJ ruled that Serb forces had not committed genocide in Croatia, and stated that the Croatian legal team had failed to prove that any mass killing had taken place in Voƒáin.Judgement re Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v.

Mural at Klarenthal Abbey, drawing by H. Dors, 1632Imagina of Isenburg-Limburg (ca. 1255 ‚Äì 29 September 1313?) was the Queen consort of Adolf of Nassau, King of Germany. Life Imagina was born in about 1255 (probably in Limburg an der Lahn) to Gerlach I of Limburg and Imagina of Blieskastel. Her father, from the House of Limburg (a collateral line of the House of Isenburg) held power over Limburg an der Lahn. Her paternal grandparents were Henry I of Isenburg-Grenzau and his wife Irmingard of B√ºdingen, Countess of Cleberg. In 1270, she married Count Adolf of Nassau, from the Walramian Line of the House of Nassau. Their main residences were Idstein Castle and Sonnenberg Castle. After the election of Adolf in 1292 as King of Germany, she resided mainly in the Reichsburg Achalm when she did not accompany her husband on his travels. After the death of her husband in the Battle of G√∂llheim, Imagina had the Early Gothic \\"King's Cross\\" erected on the battlefield. In 1309, she witnessed the transfer of her husband's remains from Rosenthal Abbey (in present-day Kerzenheim) to the Speyer Cathedral.

Singh joined the army in 1941, and took part in the Burma Campaign of World War II, receiving the Military Medal for his actions during the Battle of the Admin Box in 1944. He also fought in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, and was awarded the PVC for his role in saving a forward post at Richhmar Gali, south of Tithwal.

After completing his primary schooling in his village, in 1941, he joined the Army.  Military career  On 15 September 1941, he enrolled in the 1st battalion of the Sikh Regiment. For his conduct and courage in the Battle of the Admin Box during the Burma Campaign of World War II, he was awarded the Military Medal.The London Gazette. 16 May 1944.

He was one of the five soldiers selected by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to raise the Indian flag for the first time after independence in 1947. =War of 1947= In the aftermath of the independence of India in 1947, India and Pakistan fought over the princely state of Kashmir for a brief period. During the initial stages of the conflict, Pakistan's Pashtun tribal militias crossed the border of the state, occupying several villages, including Tithwal. That village, being on the Line of Control in the Kupwara Sector, was a strategically important point for India. On 23 May 1948, the Indian Army captured Tithwal from Pakistani troops, but the Pakistanis quickly launched a counter-attack to recapture the area. The Indian troops, unable to withstand the attack, withdrew from their positions to the Tithwal ridge, preparing to regain their positions at the right moment. As the battle at Tithwal continued for months, the Pakistanis grew desperate and launched a massive attack on 13 October, hoping to drive the Indians from their positions. Their primary objective was to capture the Richhmar Gali, located south of Tithwal, and the Nastachur Pass, east of Tithwal. During the fierce battle on the night of 13 October at Richhmar Gali, Lance Naik Singh was commanding a 1SIKH forward post. Although outnumbered ten-to-one by the Pakistani troops, the Sikhs repelled their attacks multiple times. With their ammunition running out, Singh ordered his men to join the main company, knowing that reinforcement was impossible under Pakistani shelling. With the help of another soldier, he brought two injured men along, though he himself was wounded. Under the heavy Pakistani fire, Singh moved from position to position, boosting the morale of his men and intermittently throwing grenades. Despite being wounded twice, he refused evacuation and continued to hold the first line of trenches. During the fifth wave of attacks, two Pakistani soldiers closed on Singh's position; Singh jumped out of his trench and killed them with his bayonet, greatly demoralizing the Pakistanis. Singh and his men then successfully repelled three more enemy attacks before the Pakistani troops finally retreated, unable to capture their position. =Param Vir Chakra= National War Memorial, New Delhi On 21 June 1950, Singh's award of the Param Vir Chakra was gazetted. The citation read: On 10 January 1957, now a havildar (sergeant), Singh was promoted to the junior commissioned officer (JCO) rank of jemadar (later redesignated naib subedar) with the service number of JC-6415. He was promoted to subedar on 1 March 1964, and was later promoted to subedar-major. On 26 January 1969, he received an honorary commission in the rank of captain. Singh retired in September 1969. Later life Singh died on 20 January 1993 in his village, and was survived by his wife, Gurdial Kaur, and children.  Other honours  In the 1980s, the Shipping Corporation of India (SCI), a Government of India enterprise under the aegis of the Ministry of Shipping, named fifteen of its crude oil tankers in honour of the PVC recipients. The tanker MT Lance Naik Karam Singh, PVC was delivered to SCI on 30 July 1984, and served for 25 years before being phased out. The government also built a memorial in his honour at the District Administrative Complex in Sangrur.

In his six first-class innings he scored 56 runs, with a best of 18, at an average of 11.20. He did not bowl or take a catch. He played against Surrey, an 'All England XI' and Kent, all the matches being held at Bramall Lane, Sheffield. He is notable for making his first-class debut at the advanced age of 41. Life and career Appleton was born in Kirk Ella, East Riding of Yorkshire. Yorkshire lost to Surrey in mid June by ten wickets, with Appleton scoring 5 and 16 batting at number five. Yorkshire opened with 188, thanks to Greenwood's 83, but Surrey's reply put the game out of reach as four batsman passed 50 in a score of 327. Yorkshire forced Surrey to bat a second time, just, with 143 but a target of six runs hardly tested the brown caps' openers. Appleton's second match saw Yorkshire beaten by an 'All England XI' by an innings and 255 runs in mid July. After the England XI had compiled a mammoth 524 in 320 overs, Appleton, batting down at number ten, scored an unbeaten 14 in Yorkshire's reply of 125. Promoted to open the innings as Yorkshire followed on, Appleton continued his defiance to post eighteen runs, but Yorkshire were soon destroyed by Wooton, who took all 10 wickets for 54 runs in 31.3 overs. Appleton's score, though the third biggest of the innings, was dwarfed by Darnton's unbeaten 81. Appleton's final match saw yet another defeat for his team, this time by an innings and 70 runs against Kent. Having restricted the visitors to a manageable 159, Yorkshire were skittled for a hundred runs less with Appleton contributing two runs from number three in the order. Things went from bad to worse as Yorkshire were bowled out for 30 as they followed on, with no batsman making double figures. In his last ever first-class innings, Appleton fell for a single. Willsher, for Kent, completed match figures of 12 for 28. Appleton died at Bradley Hall in Standish, Wigan, Lancashire, at the age of 80.

In the 1990s, Khoo was the first Sun Tzu student in South-east Asia to link and teach the general's principles in relation to business and management. To date, Khoo has written over 26 business and management books, most of which are based on Sun Tzu's Art of War as he made it his life's mission to \\"suntzunize\\" as many people as possible. In 1997, although a Malaysian citizen, he was appointed as honorary Assistant Superintendent of Police by the Singapore Police Force in recognition for his contribution as consultant-trainer to the police force of Singapore. His first novel, Taikor, was nominated by the National Library of Malaysia for the 2006 International Dublin Literary Award. Since 1999, Khoo has gone into retirement and occasionally travels in Malaysia and Singapore. Life=Early years= Khoo was born in 1956 in the Penang state of Malaysia. He received his formal education at St. Xavier's Institution before leaving for Singapore in 1974, to continue his pre-university education at St. Joseph's Institution. After completing his studies in 1978, he worked as a journalist with The Star in Kuala Lumpur until 1980 when he joined Malaysia's largest sugar refinery, Malayan Sugar Manufacturing Company Berhad, as a personnel manager. To help him in tackle the numerous challenging tasks he faced in Malayan Sugar then, his future wife, Judy Hwang, gave him some notes of her translation of Sun Tzu's Art of War from Chinese to English, as he is not conversant in Chinese. Khoo immediately took keen interest in the military treatise and began to learn and apply Sun Tzu's teachings into his work. Throughout his professional career, Sun Tzu's Art of War was his indispensable guide. Khoo married Judy, a former Taiwanese singer in early 1982. In 1983, he moved to Kuala Lumpur as sales and marketing manager. When Asian sugar baron Robert Kuok was invited to turn around the ailing Multi-Purpose group of companies in 1987, Khoo joined them as administration manager at Magnum Corporation. In 1989, he left Magnum to head the personnel and administration department of Metroplex Holdings Berhad, where he later became the general manager within just four months, managing The Mall shopping complex. Khoo initiated a series of management and sales policies that enabled The Mall to secure the 'Best Shopping Mall' award for two years in a row. In the same year, he began writing his first best- seller; War at Work ‚Äì Applying Sun Tzu's Art of War in Today's Business World, which was a collection of memoranda based on Sun Tzu's Art of War he wrote to his managers at The Mall. From the early 1980s, Khoo tried to pursue a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree from various universities, but all of them rejected his application as he did not possess a first degree for admission. Khoo only had two professional diplomas ‚Äì a Diploma in Administrative Management and a Certified Diploma in Accounting and Finance from ACCA. He finally received an unconditional offer from the University of Stirling after he impressed the visiting Director of the MBA programme showing how he managed the award-winning shopping mall. In 1989, accompanied by his wife, he left Malaysia to pursue his MBA studies in Scotland and graduated with Distinction in 1991. Instead of returning to Malaysia, he went to Singapore again to seek better opportunities there and was offered the job as Director of Operations for Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC). =Retrenchment= In early 1994, Khoo was retrenched from KFC as a result of an ownership change. He said: From his home near Outram Park, Khoo set up Stirling Training & Management Consultants Pte Ltd, a training and consultancy firm, which assisted clients in planning and implementing strategies, and motivating their executives through his proprietary \\"Management: The Sun Tzu Way\\" programmes. He ran the company with his wife, who handles all the accounting and administration. Half of his time was spent elsewhere, conducting management seminars for businessmen and employees of multinational corporations. Khoo also lectured part-time on Strategic Management for Singapore Institute of Management's external degree programmes. In early 1999, he co-authored with Nigel Munro-Smith, a lecturer at RMIT University in Australia, to produce a book titled Reader Friendly Strategic Management that brings out the essentials of strategic management for beginners. =Early retirement= In 1999, at the age of 43, Khoo decided to 'hang up his sword' (as described in his own words) to live a quiet and leisurely life in Cameron Highlands of Malaysia, with his wife and their \\"four-legged son\\", Bandit, a Yorkshire Terrier to this very day. When asked on his decision to live in the mountains, Khoo said: =Commendation= As a consultant-trainer to the Singapore Police Force since 1995, Khoo has taught many police officers in Singapore how to use Sun Tzu's principles of \\"Generalship\\" to be effective leaders and team builders. In 1997, he was sent for intensive training and thereafter appointed as honorary Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) in recognition for his contribution to the police force of Singapore. On 1 July 2009, Khoo was promoted to the honorary rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police for his long years of service to the police force. His works=Sun Tzu series= Sun Tzu (pinyin: Sun Zi; c. 544 BC ‚Äì 496 BC) was a native of the Qi state (now Huimin county in Shandong) during the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history, that was characterised by warring factions and a fragmented state. He came to the attention of King He Lu of Wu, who was impressed by his 13-chapter military treatise, The Art of War. In 512 BC, He Lu made Sun Tzu his Commander-in-Chief of the Wu army. For almost 20 years, the armies of Wu were victorious over their hereditary enemies, the kingdoms of Chu and Yue. In 496 BC, after He Lu died from his wounds in battle, his son, Fu Chai succeeded him. After numerous victories in battles, Fu Chai became arrogant and began to indulge in merrymaking. In time, the king started to disregard Sun Tzu's counsel and began to distance himself from Sun Tzu. Sensing this, Sun Tzu wisely gave up his position and left Wu for Qi in retirement. Fu Chai and his generals did not follow Sun Tzu's precepts and his kingdom was subsequently conquered by Chu in 473 BC. Out of shame, Fu Chai committed suicide after he had fled with the remnants of his defeated army. As a contemporary teacher of Sun Tzu's Art of War, Khoo has written over 26 books on business and management based on its principles such as: * Crime Prevention: The Sun Tzu Way (2006)Co-authored with Datuk Christopher Wan, Malaysia's CID Director * Win Without Fighting (2006) * Applying Sun Tzu's Art of War (2002) ‚Äì A six handguides collection * Sun Tzu: The Keeper of CEO's Conscience (1997) * Applying Sun Tzu's Art of War in Corporate Politics (1995) * Sun Tzu and Management (1992) * War at Work: Applying Sun Tzu's Art of War in Today Business World (1990) Due to his ability to translate what is a complicated treatise into an easily readable and understandable prose for a beginner, Khoo's Sun Tzu series were well received and continue to grow in scope and depth in later years. He additionally manages to add realism by injecting real-life situations culled from his 15 years in management, that provoke much thought and encourage readers to assess their own performance, and take positive measures to become more effective in their workplace and interpersonal relationships. =Novels= His first novel, Taikor, was released in late 2004. It is a historical saga of Malaya which traces the years 1922 to 1982, telling the story of Ya Loong, from his family's migration from South Thailand to Penang after his father's death. It was among the 132 entries nominated for the 2006 International Dublin Literary Award. His second novel, Mamasan, is about life of those people working in the glitzy world of nightclubbing and their customers who patronise nightclubs. It was released in April 2007. His third novel, Nanyang, is a historical saga about the multi- racial people who inhabit the lands of the 'Southern Ocean', as early Chinese migrants called Malaya and Singapore. It hit the book stores in October 2007.

History The company was first formed in 1908 as a partnership between H.P. Martin and George Handasyde and known as Martin & Handasyde. Their No.1 monoplane was built in 1908‚Äì1909 and succeeded in lifting off the ground before being wrecked in a gale.British Aircraft Before the Great War, Michael H. Goodall & Albert E. Tagg, p.187 They went on to build a succession of largely monoplane designs although it was a biplane, the S.1 of 1914, that turned Martin- Handasyde into a successful aircraft manufacturer. In 1915 they renamed the company Martinsyde Ltd, and it became Britain's third largest aircraft manufacturer during World War One, with flight sheds at Brooklands and a large factory in nearby Woking. Martinsyde Motorcycles Martinsyde motorcycle, 1922, model C, 498 cc Martinsyde began manufacturing motorcycles from 1919 after buying the rights to engine designs by Howard Newman, which included a 350 cc single and a 677 cc V-twin with an unusual exhaust-over-inlet layout. The 680 engine was fitted into a diamond-type frame with Brampton forks. Martinsyde had to overcome problems with components before its new range could be launched, initially under the trade name of Martinsyde-Newman, until the third partner Newman left the company. (Newman was also involved in manufacturing and designing Ivy motorcycles.) The V-twin motorcycle had a hand gear change, and a three-speed gearbox built under licence from AJS. Martinsyde's engine was very flexible and became popular for off-road trials competition, where the singles quickly gained a reputation for reliability, at Brooklands, where Martinsyde won the team award in 1922, and the Scottish Six Days Trial. Martinsyde motorcycles were offered with sidecars and the Martinsyde 680 was followed by a 500 cc model in 1920, with a sports version in 1921. In 1922 Martinsyde produced a 738 cc sports V-twin, named the Quick Six which produced and was capable of . The engine featured the company's normal overhead exhaust and side-valve inlet, but with Ricardo pistons, accurately balanced flywheels, all reciprocating parts lightened, nickel steel con-rods machined all over, and close ratio three speed gearbox.\\"A New Sports V-Twin\\", Motor Cycle, May 11th 1922, p599 Martinsyde was experimenting with new designs, including valve gear controlled by leaf springs, when its Woking factory was destroyed by a fire in 1922, forcing the company into liquidation after produced over 2,000 motorcycles.

Biography  Hopkins was probably born in Hursley, England since her baptism record is there along with older sister and younger brother. Constance was the second daughter of Stephen Hopkins, by his first wife, Mary. Some believe she was named in honor of Constance (Marline) Hopkins. Constance, at the age of fourteen, along with her father and his second wife Elizabeth (Fisher), accompanied by brother Giles, half-sister Damaris as well as two servants by the name of Edward Doty and Edward Lester were passengers on the Mayflower on its journey to the New World in 1620. Along the way her half-brother Oceanus was born, the only child born on the Mayflower journey.

We do not know the exact location of their graves. Constance married Nicholas sometime before the Division of Cattle which occurred May 22, 1627. Nicholas came to Plymouth on board the ship Anne in 1623 and was made a freeman at Plymouth in 1633. The inventory of Nicholas Snow's estate made at his death lists a wide variety of cooper's and carpenter's tools; this may indicate his trade.

Although he appeared only three times, his career spanned six years, from 1873 to 1878. His father-in-law was William Coates, a career soldier. Biography Armitage was born at Birky Grange, Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England. Although a left arm fast bowler, he failed to take a wicket for Yorkshire - he bowled just one spell of six overs, two maidens, for 29 runs. He found little more success with the bat, scoring just 26 runs in his five innings in the middle order, with a top score of 12 and an average of 5.20. He made no catches. The first of his two appearances in 1873 was against Gloucestershire at Bramall Lane in Sheffield, in July. Yorkshire's decision to bat after winning the toss proved unwise as they were skittled out for 113, with Armitage at number six run out for 7. W.G. Grace scored 79 and Townsend 88 in the visitors' 282, despite Armitage's one and only spell of bowling in first-class cricket. He was bowled for a duck in Yorkshire's second effort of 247, and Gloucestershire completed their six-wicket victory in 32 overs, with two more Grace brothers making contributions with the bat. Armitage's second match, against Nottinghamshire at St. John's Ground in Huddersfield, was a more satisfying affair. Although he made just 12 in Yorkshire's 194 and did not bowl, the visitors were dismissed for 104 and 66 to lose by an innings and 24 runs. Despite this turn in fortunes, Yorkshire did not call on his services again until the Australian tourists came to Fartown in Huddersfield in May 1878. Yorkshire made a poor start, dismissed for just 72 by Spofforth (4 - 30) and Boyle (5 - 32). Batting at number six, Armitage scored two runs before being bowled by Boyle. Australia fared little better in reply, posting 113 with Emmet taking 5 for 23. An Armitage did bowl and take a wicket for Yorkshire, but it was his namesake Tom. Yorkshire did one run better second time around: Spofforth took 5 for 31, while Armitage was dismissed caught Gregory bowled Midwinter for five, in his final first-class match. The Australians lost four wickets to Emmett and Hill, but won in 40.2 overs, and the first-class career of Armitage was done. Armitage died at High Royd House, Honley, Yorkshire, at the age of 67.

Retrieved October 7, 2008. Manual handling hazards Any job that involves heavy labor or manual material handling may include a high risk for injury on the job. Manual material handling entails lifting, but also usually includes climbing, pushing, pulling, and pivoting, all of which pose the risk of injury to the back. MMH work contributes to a large percentage of a 1.1 million cases of musculoskeletal disorders reported annually in the United States. Musculoskeletal disorders often involve strains and sprains to the lower back, shoulders, and upper limbs. Potentially injurious tasks may involve bending and twisting, repetitive motions, carrying or lifting heavy loads, and maintaining fixed positions for a long time. MMH under these conditions can lead to damaged muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves, and blood vessels. Remember your health comes first, it is temporary so make good use of it. Legislation In the UK, all organisations have a duty to protect employees from injury from manual handling activities and this duty is outlined in the Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992 (MHOR) as amended.Health and Safety Executive, Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992 (as amended) (MHOR), accessed 17 October 2020 The Regulations define manual handling as \\"... any transporting or supporting of a load (including the lifting, putting down, pushing, pulling, carrying or moving thereof) by hand or bodily force\\". The load can be an object, person or animal. Safe manual handling techniques Ergonomic intervention in manual handling can decrease injuries and increase worker productivity. =Climbing= When climbing with a load, safe material handling includes maintaining contact with the ladder or stairs at three points (two hands and a foot or both feet and a hand). Bulky loads would require a second person or a mechanical device to assist. =Pushing and pulling= Manual material handling may require pushing or pulling. Pushing is generally easier on the back than pulling. It is important to use both the arms and legs to provide the leverage to start the push. =Pivoting= When moving containers, handlers are safer when pivoting their shoulders, hips and feet with the load in front at all times rather than twisting their back. The lower back is not designed to torque or for repetitive twisting.

On the Day of Atonement, a goat would have its horns wrapped with a red cloth ‚Äì representing the sins of the community ‚Äì and be driven off. Hunt started painting on the shore of the Dead Sea, and continued it in his studio in London. The work exists in two versions, a small version in brighter colours with a dark-haired goat and a rainbow, in Manchester Art Gallery, and a larger version in more muted tones with a light-haired goat in the Lady Lever Art Gallery in Port Sunlight. Both were created over the same period, with the smaller Manchester version being described as \\"preliminary\\" to the larger Lady Lever version, which was the one exhibited.The Scapegoat, Lady Lever Art Gallery History In the Royal Academy exhibition catalogue Hunt wrote that \\"the scene was painted at Oosdoom, on the margin of the salt-encrusted shallows of the Dead Sea. The mountains beyond are those of Edom.\\"Bronkhurst, Judith, Wiliam Holman Hunt, A Catalogue Raisonn√©, vol. 1, p.180. He painted most of the work on location in 1854, but completed the work in London in the following year, adding some touches in 1856 before its exhibition at the academy. The painting was the only major work completed by Hunt during his first trip to the Holy Land, to which he had travelled after a crisis of religious faith. Hunt intended to experience the actual locations of the Biblical narratives as a means to confront the relationship between faith and truth. While in Jerusalem, Hunt had met Henry Wentworth Monk, a millenarian prophet who had distinctive theories about the meaning of the scapegoat and the proximity of the Last Judgement. Monk was particularly preoccupied with Christian Zionism. Hunt chose a subject derived from the Torah as part of a project to convert Jews to Christianity. He believed that Judaic views of the scapegoat were consistent with the Christian conception of the Messiah as a suffering figure. He wrote to his friend Millais, \\"I am sanguine that [the Scapegoat] may be a means of leading any reflecting Jew to see a reference to the Messiah as he was, and not as they understand, a temporal King.\\"Fleming, G.H., John Everett Millais: A Biography, 1998, Constable, p.158 The Book of Leviticus describes a \\"scapegoat\\" which must be ritually expelled from the flocks of the Israelite tribes as part of a sacrificial ritual of cleansing. In line with traditional Christian theology, Hunt believed that the scapegoat was a prototype for the redemptive sacrifice of Jesus, and that the goat represented that aspect of the Messiah described in Isaiah as a \\"suffering servant\\" of God. Hunt had the picture framed with the quotations \\"Surely he hath borne our Griefs and carried our Sorrows; Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of GOD and afflicted.\\" (Isaiah 53:4) and \\"And the Goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a Land not inhabited.\\" (Leviticus 16:22) Critical reception The reaction to the painting was not as Hunt expected. In his autobiography Pre-Raphaelitism and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Hunt relates the first reaction to the painting by art dealer Ernest Gambart: Dante Gabriel Rossetti, in a letter to William Allingham in 1856, called the painting \\"a grand thing, but not for the public\\". Ford Madox Brown wrote in his diary: \\"Hunt's Scapegoat requires to be seen to be believed in. Only then can it be understood how, by the might of genius, out of an old goat, and some saline encrustations, can be made one of the most tragic and impressive works in the annals of art.\\". Ernest Gambart, as related by Hunt, was less enthusiastic, and was later to remark: \\"I wanted a nice religious picture and he painted me a great goat.\\" The Art Journal in 1860, at the time of the exhibition of Hunt's later work The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple, was to characterise the painting as \\"having disappointed even his warmest admirers\\". At the time of the exhibition of The Scapegoat itself, in 1856, The Art Journal questioned Hunt's eye for colour in the painting, casting doubt that the mountains of Edom, seen in the background, really were in actual appearance as painted ‚Äì which Matthew Dennison, writing in The Spectator in 2008 described the Manchester version as \\"Day-Glo striations of lilac, crimson and egg-yolk yellow\\". Dennison suggests the possibility that Hunt was painting the scene from memory, when he was finishing the painting in London after he had returned from his trip to the Dead Sea, and mis-remembered it. Evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton, who saw the painting as a boy and was deeply impressed by the \\"sci-fi book cover\\" intensity of it, wrote after visiting Israel that \\"now on the shores of the Dead Sea I knew that I saw exactly the background I had remembered...if anything more exceptional, more other-worldly, than the painting had made them.\\"pg259-260, \\"At The World's Crossroads\\", The Collected Papers of W.D. Hamilton: Narrow Roads of Gene Land, Volume 2, Evolution of Sex 2001, . Hunt's own description of the landscape that he painted is that \\"never was so extraordinary a scene of beautifully arranged horrible wilderness. It is black, full of asphalte scum and in the hand slimy, and smarting as a sting ‚Äì No one can stand and say that it is not accursed of God.\\" Art critic Peter Fuller, in 1989, described the landscape of the painting as \\"a terrible image [‚Ä¶] of the world as a god-forsaken wasteland, a heap of broken images where the sun beats\\".

The Triangle Region began as the general term for the industrial and communications hubs of Kolding, Vejle and Fredericia in the early 1960s. The three cities (thus ‚Äòtriangle‚Äô) originally worked together to coordinate and collaborate locally, but have since expanded into a cooperation between seven municipalities, which together have 421,480 inhabitants (as of 1 January 2018) and cover an area of 4,266.0 km2. An area of political and economic stability, the Triangle Region is often regarded as Denmark‚Äôs third major region after Aarhus and Copenhagen. It has a reputation for having lower levels of pollution, crime and traffic problems than the big cities.  Contents = History = The Triangle Region was historically an industrial area with an emphasis on production and logistics but more recently, it has become a hub for entrepreneurs, tourism and energy companies. A formal cooperation between municipalities in the region began in 1994 and the current Triangle Area Denmark was established in 2007 by the new municipalities of Billund, Fredericia, Kolding, Middelfart, Vejen and Vejle. Haderslev joined in 2016.  Billund  Billund was first mentioned as \\"Byllundt\\" in the year 1454 and as \\"Billund\\" in 1510. In 1916, Ole Kirk Christiansen, who would later found LEGO, bought a Billund furniture company that was founded in 1895. He invested in the town, creating a new dairy and the Skjoldbjerg church. In 1930, Kirk Christiansen began producing utility items such as ironing boards, stepladders and miniature toys. His first toys were created from leftover production scraps but his true toy production started in 1932. In 1934, the toy factory was named \\"LEGO.\\" A small town, Billund today is most notable as the home of the LEGO Group, for LEGOLAND, and for Billund Airport, the second largest airport in Denmark. The airport opened in 1964 and was built by the LEGO Group, but is now run independently.  Fredericia  Fredericia was designed and built in 1650 by Frederick III as the principal fortress for Jutland. When the city was built, the King gave certain privileges to the city such a freedom of religion and asylum, giving the city a unique diversity (in comparison with the rest of the country) that is still visible today. In 1849 the Danes defeated the Prussians at Fredericia. The fortress was closed in 1909, and the city's modern development began. Fredericia Harbor is among Denmark's busiest and most important harbors. The city has traditionally been famed for the manufacture of refined petroleum, chemicals, textiles, frozen fish, machinery, and tobacco, as well as import from especially Asia and the now closed ship yard. Taulov, located halfway between Fredericia and Kolding, is the main village of a parish that historically was home to a local vassal, making it the administrative center of the area known as Elbo Herred. Despite recent finds of significant burial mounds and farm houses dating back to the Danish Iron Age, the village itself has little to no significance and was a small railway town with its own municipality until the 1970s, after which it became part of Fredericia Municipality and the arrival of the motorway gave the village a growth spur. The combination of the railroad and motorway has made Taulov an important focal point for the Triangle Region in terms of infrastructure, as the area is unique in having railroad and motorway junctions connecting the area to all of Denmark, Germany and the rest of Scandinavia, and the proximity to one of Denmark's largest harbors and the nearby Billund Airport. The 'Taulov Transport Center' was designated as a 'Core Rail Road Terminal' by the European Union in 2014. The village is also home to various manufacturing facilities such as an Arla Foods export plant and Veks√∏ A/S, a street furniture manufacturing company, and the new 'DanmarkC' area between Taulov and Fredericia is expanding greatly with retail and storage facilities. A new train station is currently being proposed in Taulov to serve as a \\"Park & Ride\\"-station for the region when faster train services will be implemented.  Haderslev  Haderslev is situated in a valley, leading from Vojens to Haderslev Fjord and the Baltic Sea. Haderslev was presumably founded by Vikings at least a century before it was granted status as royal borough in 1292. At that time, it had become one of the main trading centres in Southern Jutland. In 1327, Haderslevhus, the royal castle, was mentioned for the first time. It was situated east of the cathedral; an area still called Slotsgrunden. In the following centuries the city prospered, building both the Gothic Cathedral and the second castle of Hansborg (burnt in 1644), which was similar to Kronborg. Due to the plague in Copenhagen, King Christian IV was married there. In the 16th century, the city became one of the first Scandinavian places to embrace the Lutheran Reformation. Prior to the Second Schleswig War of 1864, Haderslev was situated in the Duchy of Schleswig, a Danish fief, so its history is properly included in the contentious history of Schleswig-Holstein. From 1864 it was part of Prussia, and as such part of the North German Confederation, and from 1871 onwards, part of the German Empire. In the 1920 Schleswig Plebiscite that returned Northern Schleswig to Denmark, 38.6% of Haderslev's inhabitants voted for remaining part of Germany and 61.4% voted for the cession to Denmark. It was formerly the capital of the German Kreis Hadersleben and the Danish Haderslev County.  Kolding  Kolding is a seaport located at the head of Kolding Fjord where the Battle of Kolding was fought on 25 December 1658. The allied Polish and Danish forces under hetman Stefan Czarniecki defeated the Swedish forces of Charles X Gustav of Sweden. A battle between German and Danish forces took place near the town on 23 April 1849 during the First War of Schleswig. Of note in the city are Koldinghus, a royal castle built in 1248 that now houses a historical museum, and Saint Nicolai, Denmark‚Äôs oldest stone church (built in the 13th century). Christiansfeld is a town within the Kolding municipality with a population of 2,898 (1 January 2013). It was founded in 1773 by the Moravian Church and named after the Danish King Christian VII. To encourage construction, King Christian VII promised a 10-year tax holiday for the city and paid 10% of the construction costs of new houses. In 1864, Christiansfeld and the rest of Schleswig was ceded to Prussia as a result of Denmark's defeat in the Second Schleswig War. It remained a part of Germany until 1920 when, as a part of a plebiscite called for by the Treaty of Versailles, Northern Schleswig voted to re-join Denmark. After reunification, the Moravian church lost some of the rights it had obtained as a part of the town's founding in the 18th century. For example, it no longer had the ability to choose the town's leadership, paving the way for the town's first Danish mayor who was not a member of the church in 1920.[3] The church also sold its schools at this time due to the declining membership of its congregation. From 1970 to 2007, the town was the administrative seat of Christiansfeld Municipality, but it lost this status and was placed in the Kolding Municipality as a part of the Municipal Reform of 2007 (Kommunalreformen 2007). The houses in the town of Christiansfeld are built from yellow brick and detailed with fine craftsmanship, giving the town a unique character and making is a popular tourist destination. In 2013, Christiansfeld applied to be added to the list of UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Sites.  Middelfart  The earliest record mentioning the settlement is in 1231 but from the Middle Ages until the end of the 19th century, Middelfart was famed for its local fishermen who were also whale hunters in winter. Whale blubber was used for lamps, but the coming of electricity made whale hunting uneconomical. In the 20th century, hunting was resumed during the two world wars and two memorial stones now stand where the hunters landed the whales and where blubber was prepared.  Vejen  The history of Vejen goes back to the beginning of industrial revolution and the arrival of the railroad in the mid 1800s. Vejen was originally a small agricultural village but with the addition of the railroad, industries grew and Vejen grew into a city. Today Vejen is the main city in the municipality of Vejen. Other towns are R√∏dding, Holsted and Br√∏rup.  Vejle  The city of Vejle began as a seaport at the head of the Vejle Fjord with manufacturing in textiles, iron, hardware, canned goods, and leather goods. Of note in Vejle is St. Nicholas Church (13th century, restored). Jelling is a village within Vejle municipality famous for the Jelling stones, the Jelling stone ship and two large burial mounds. In the North Mound, built between 958 and 959 CE (possibly for King Gorm the Old of Denmark), an empty burial chamber was found. The South Mound was built around 970 and contains no burial. Beneath the two mounds is a large stone ship from around the end of the 9th century. Between the two mounds stand two rune stones, the Jelling stones. Near the stones, Gorm's son King Harald Bluetooth, the man who brought Christianity to Denmark, built a wooden church (965). Beneath it, he re- interred the remains of his father (965‚Äì966). The Jelling stones and Jelling Church have been an UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1994. Bluetooth communications was named after Harald Bluetooth as he was known for his unification of previously warring tribes from Denmark (including Scania, present-day Sweden, where the technology was invented), and Norway. Bluetooth technology likewise was intended to unify different communications systems, such as computers and mobile phones. = Geography = Location  The Triangle Region is situated in the southern-central part of Denmark, and is a sub-area of the Region of Southern Denmark. The Region of Southern Denmark includes the southern part of the Jutland peninsula, bordering Germany, and the Island of Funen. The Triangle Region is located at the western tip of the Island of Funen and the eastern shore of the Jutland peninsula, where the Little Belt Strait is at its most narrow. Due to its location, The Triangle Region is a major transport hub as more or less all north-south and east-west motorway and rail traffic passes through The Triangle Region. The region is characterised by both large towns and rural areas with intensive agriculture. The region is also characterised with a large number of energy companies and is a hub for energy infrastructure.  Climate  Yearly precipitation is over 900 mm in some parts of The Triangle Region and rain is more or less even distributed through the year. The climate in Denmark is pleasant in the summertime (May - August) and the days are long and light, until 22.00-22.30 in June. Typical daytime temperatures in the midsummer are a little more than 20 degrees C, the sun is strong and skies can be clear. Winter in Denmark tends to be cold, with temperatures averaging at zero degrees Celsius and days that are dark and short between October and March. = Attractions = Beaches and Parks  The Triangle Region‚Äôs coastline is sprinkled with numerous fine sandy beaches where the water is shallow and the sea is calm. The fjords and the Little Belt also provide plentiful sheltered beaches, great for swimming. Vejle Deer Park was established in 1948 and across 23 acres of land above the Vejle Fjord. There are 2 different deer species in the park with approximately 50 fallow deer and 10 sika deer. The park is located in the north of Vejle in the woodland \\"N√∏rreskoven\\", it is free of charge and it is open all year round.  Museums and Historical Attractions  Trapholt Museum in Kolding (just above Kolding Fjord) has a collection of modern art and also contains Denmark's largest collection of chairs from the 20th Century, and the famous Danish architect Arne Jacobsen's unique holiday house (www.trapholt.dk). Koldinghus in Kolding is where the Danish King built a fortress in 1268 to guard the border between the Kingdom of Denmark and the Duchy of Schleswig. The earliest parts still standing date from the 15th century. The newly restored wings of the castle have now also become international attractions in themselves (www.koldinghus.dk). The Moravian Church in Christiansfeld is a popular tourist destination and was nominated as a tentative UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993. Vejle Museum of Art (Danish: Vejle Kunstmuseum www.vejlekunstmuseum.dk) in Vejle has Danish paintings and sculptures on display and is home to a collection of Golden Age paintings from the Vejle area as well as a collection of drawings by Rembrandt. Jelling in Vejle municipality is famous for the Jelling stones - a large stone ship and two large burial mounds. In the North Mound, built between 958 and 959 CE (possibly for King Gorm of Denmark), an empty burial chamber was found. Beneath the mounds is a large stone ship from the end of the 9th century. Between the two mounds stand two rune stones, the Jelling stones. Gorm's son King Harald ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù I of Denmark built a wooden church (965) on the site and beneath it re-interred (965‚Äì966) the remains of his father. The Jelling stones and Jelling Church have been an UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1994.  Entertainment and the Performing Arts  The Triangle Region's annual Kulturligt Festival combines theatre, music, food, drink, craft, lectures and cultural excursions. Fredericia Theatre is famed for its musicals and developing new works as well as hosting more than 100 events annually, ranging from opera to stand-up and concerts (www.fredericiateater.dk).  Amusement Parks  LEGOLAND in Billund, is the oldest of the LEGO themed chain of amusement parks worldwide. It is divided into ten different worlds: Duplo Land, Imagination Zone, LEGOREDO Town, Adventure Land, Mini Land, Pirate Land, LEGO City, Knights‚Äô Kingdom, Viking Land, and Polar Land. The park opened in 1968 and has 1.6 million visitors annually, making it the largest tourist attraction in Denmark outside Copenhagen. = Education = The International School of Billund. The LEGO Foundation set up the International School of Billund in August 2013 to cater for students aged 3 to 9 years with children up to 16 invited to join from 2015. The school follows the International Baccalaureate curriculum (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/09/lego- funded-school-denmark- innovationhttps://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/apr/22/lego-school- building-learning) The Gymnasium of Kolding also offers the International Baccalaureate programme with teaching in English. In Denmark, the International Baccalaureate is recognised as an equivalent to the Danish Upper Secondary School Diploma (:da:Studentereksamen). The University of Southern Denmark in Kolding focuses on design oriented research and education plus collaboration with the local business community and public institutions (http://www.sdu.dk/en/om_sdu/byerne/kolding). = Transport = The Triangle Region area has a well-established transportation infrastructure making it a hub for most of Denmark, as a Connection between North, South, East and West, and Germany and the rest of Scandinavia. The 'Taulov Transport Center' was in 2014 designated as a 'Core Rail Road Terminal' by the European Union as the only Transport Center in Denmark.  Public Transportation  The Triangle Region has an extensive and efficient public transport system that the government encourages the public to use on a regular basis. In fact, many bus and train services correspond so that travel time is kept to minimum and passengers are not left waiting around. Rejseplanen.dk is Denmark‚Äôs Journey Planner, providing up to date information on routes, journey times and costs.  Airports  Billund Airport serves as Denmark‚Äôs second biggest airport offering international flights to 40 destinations. Set up by the LEGO family in the 1960s, it is now run independently though its proximity to LEGOLAND makes the airport popular during the summer months with many major airlines operating a service. For the majority of the passengers in western Denmark, this is their main airport for international travel.

It can also be a source of information for machines, particularly those biologically-inspired models and is provided by a set of laser rangefinders, sonars, or vision. Allothetic is used in navigation models (e.g., of a rat in a maze) as in the phrase \\"allothetic map\\" to indicate that a global map, not orientated or centred on the subject was used, rather than idiothetic, which means a navigation system centred on the subject. Directional information may be sourced from familiar reference points such as the sun, stars, or the Earth's magnetic field. Allothetic cues are often employed with idiothetic information to achieve spatial behavior. Their characteristics are complementary such as the way the latter can help address the allothetic information's perceptual aliasing problem, which prevents an animal or a robot from distinguishing two places from each other.  Animal navigation  Animals can obtain the so-called pure allothetic navigation once it became familiar with fixed objects at specific locations. Relationships among these objects, particularly permanent and semi- permanent objects, are also critical in guiding the animals' movements. These objects need to be asymmetrical otherwise they will not contain identifiable information about direction. Allothetic navigation in rats uses external cues such as visual, auditory, or olfactory information to help them in foraging resources or for protection against predators. Robot navigation Robot navigation relies on allothetic and idiothetic information to determine a robot's position in its environment.Filliat, David, and Jean-Arcady Meyer. \\"Map-based navigation in mobile robots:: I. a review of localization strategies.\\" Cognitive Systems Research 4.4 (2003): 243-282.

He was Indonesia's fifth prime minister. After moving to Bandung from his hometown Solok, West Sumatra for senior high school, Natsir studied Islamic doctrine extensively. His first articles were published in 1929, and during the 1930s he wrote for several Islamic-themed papers. He entered politics in the mid-1930s, rising through the ranks of Islamic parties. On 5 September 1950, he was chosen as prime minister, a term which he served until 26 April 1951. After his term as prime minister, he became increasingly vocal about Islam's role in Indonesia and was eventually arrested for doing so. Released in 1966 after the New Order government took power, Natsir continued to be critical of the government, eventually leading to him being banned from traveling. Natsir wrote extensively on Islam, totaling 45 books and hundreds of articles. He viewed Islam as an intrinsic part of Indonesian culture and was disappointed by the Sukarno and Suharto governments' handling of the religion. He was given three honorary doctorates during his lifetime, one from Lebanon and two from Malaysia. On 10 November 2008, Natsir was honoured as a national hero of Indonesia. Biography=Early life= Natsir was born in Solok, West Sumatra on 17 July 1908. His parents were Mohammad Idris Sutan Saripado, a government employee, and Khadijah. In 1916, he studied at HIS (Hollandsch-Inlandsche School) Adabiyah, Padang. After a few months, he moved to HIS Solok, studying there by day and at the Madrasah Diniyah by night. Three years later, he moved to HIS Padang together with his older sister. In 1923, he continued his studies at MULO (Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs) and he joined Pandu Nationale Islamietische Pavinderij and Jong Islamieten Bond. He also learned to play violin. After graduating he moved to Bandung, where he studied at an AMS (Algememe Midelbare School, or senior high school). Natsir later said that he had chosen the school for its Western classics class. From 1928 until 1932, he became a chairman of JIB Bandung. He then received a teaching permit after studying for two years at a native teacher's training college. Although he had previously studied Islam in West Sumatra, while in Bandung he took a deeper interest in the religion, including subjects such as the interpretation of the Quran, Islamic jurisprudence, and dialectics; he later studied under Ahmad Hassan, the leader of Persatuan Islam. =Career= While still in high school, Natsir became involved in journalism. In 1929 he wrote two articles published in the Algemeen Indische Dagblad, entitled \\"Qur'an en Evangelie\\" (\\"The Quran and the Evangelicals\\") and \\"Muhammad als Profeet\\" (\\"Muhammad as the Prophet\\"). He also collaborated with other thinkers to publish the newspaper Pembela Islam (Defenders of Islam) from 1929 to 1935, and wrote extensively about his views on the religion for Pandji Islam (Banner of Islam), Pedoman Masyarakat (Guide for the People), and Al-ManƒÅr (The Torch). Aside from writing, Natsir founded Pendidikan Islam (Islamic Education), a private school, in 1930; the school was shut down after the Japanese occupation of Indonesia. Natsir began to associate with well-known scholars of Islam like Agus Salim, and in the mid-1930s he took Salim's place in discussing the relationship between Islam and the state with future- president Sukarno. In 1938, he enrolled as a member of Partai Islam Indonesia (The Indonesian Islamic Party), and became the chairman of the Bandung branch from 1940 until 1942. He was also employed as the Bandung Bureau Head of Education until 1945. During the Japanese occupation, he joined Majelis Islam A'la Indonesia (changed to Majelis Syura Muslimim Indonesia later), and became one of its chairmen from 1945 until the party was banned. After the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence, he became a Central Indonesian National Committee member. On 3 April 1950, he proposed a motion called Mosi Integral Natsir, that united Indonesia after an agreement which divided Indonesia to seventeen states. Soon afterwards, he became prime minister, influenced by his role as the head of Masyumi. He served until 1951. In the Guided Democracy era, he opposed the government and joined the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia. As a result, he was arrested and imprisoned in Malang from 1962 until 1964. He was released by the New Order government in July 1966. After his release from prison, Natsir became increasingly involved with organizations related to Islam, including the Majlis Ta'sisi Rabitah Alam Islami and Majlis Ala al-Alami lil Masjid, both in Mecca, the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies in England, and the World Muslim Congress in Karachi, Pakistan. In New Order era, he formed Yayasan Dewan Dakwah Islamiyah Indonesia. He also criticized government policy, like when he signed the Petisi 50 on 5 May 1980, which caused him to be banned from going overseas. He died on 14 March 1993 in Jakarta. Politics and views According to Natsir, his politics were religiously motivated, with ayat 56 of the Adh-Dhariyat as justification. His goal as a politician was to ensure that the Muslim community lived in a state where Islamic teachings \\"applied in the life of individual, society, and the state of the Republic of Indonesia\\". He also fought for human rights and the modernization of Islam. Unlike the secular, anti-communist Sukarno, who viewed religion as an entity separated from the nation, Natsir believed that the separation of church and state was not applicable to Indonesia, as he saw it was an intrinsic part of their culture and one of the main reasons they fought for independence. To support his position, he often quoted William Montgomery Watt, saying that Islam is not just a religion, but an entire culture. After independence, Natsir became increasingly disheartened by how Sukarno, and later Suharto, dealt with religion, writing in the early 1970s that Indonesia was treating Islam as one would treat \\"a cat with ring-worms \\". He later began trying to bring Pancasila, the state philosophy of Indonesia, completely in accordance with Islam. Writings Natsir published 45 books or monographs and several hundred articles dealing with his views of Islam. His early works, published in Dutch and Indonesian, dealt with Islamic doctrine, culture, the relationship between Islam and politics, and the role of women in Islam. His later works included some written in English and focused more on politics, as well as the preaching of Islam and Christian-Muslim relations. Ajip Rosidi and Haji Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah have noted that Natsir's writings serve both as historical records and also as guides for future Muslims. Legacy Natsir on a 2011 Indonesian stamp In 1980, he received award from King Faisal Foundation. In academic, he received doctorate honorary degree from Islamic University of Lebanon in 1967 for literature. In 1991, he also received an honorary doctorate from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia and Universiti Sains Malaysia for Islamic ideas. On 10 November 2008 he was honoured as a national hero of Indonesia. According to Bruce Lawrence, Natsir was \\"the most prominent politician favoring Islamic reform.\\" Personal life He married Nurnahar in Bandung on 20 October 1934. From their marriage, they had six children. Natsir could reportedly speak numerous languages, including English, Dutch, French, German, and Arabic; he was also capable of understanding Esperanto.

Although almost uniquely undistinguished in bald statistical terms, Atkinson's career had the merit of brevity at least. He is one of the few cricketers in the history of cricket to make a pair in his only first-class appearance. His lack of success makes him notable in the long annals of the game. Atkinson was born in Hull. His only appearance in the first-class game came against Worcestershire in August 1907 at Bradford's Park Avenue Cricket Ground. Thanks for a half century from G. N. Foster the visitors compiled 155, with Newstead taking 4 for 62, but Atkinson went for 17 runs in three overs. Yorkshire were then routed for 62 in 24.5 overs, Atkinson's duck coming at number 9, courtesy of a catch by Burns from the bowling of Cuffe, who took 4 for 38 in partnership with Arnold (6 for 22). Yorkshire then staged a fightback, bowling Worcestershire out for 28 in 16.2 overs. Newstead was the principal destroyer, taking 7 wickets for just 10 runs. Yorkshire ended the game all out for 91, to lose by thirty runs. Atkinson was stumped by Straw off Cuffe for nought. Atkinson played for the East Riding of Yorkshire in 1919.

A member of the Conservative Party, he is the party's candidate for the forthcoming 2021 London mayoral election. Born in North Kensington to a working-class British Jamaican family, Bailey earned a degree in computer aided engineering from London South Bank University. In 2006, he co-founded the charity MyGeneration, which focused on assisting young people; it disbanded amid financial problems in 2012. Bailey also worked as a researcher for the Centre for Policy Studies think tank and wrote several articles in the British press. Joining the Conservatives, he served as Prime Minister David Cameron's special adviser on youth and crime from 2010 to 2013. Bailey stood unsuccessfully as Conservative parliamentary candidate for Hammersmith in 2010 and Lewisham West and Penge in 2017, although was elected a London Assembly member in 2016. In 2018, Bailey was selected as the Conservative candidate in the 2021 London mayoral election (which was, at the time, scheduled for 2020, but later postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Early life Bailey was born in May 1971 in North Kensington, London. He and his younger brother were raised by his mother and extended family in the absence of his father, who worked as a lorry driver. From the age of about thirteen years old, he began to get to know his father, along with a second family his father had started, and became close to his stepsisters and stepbrother. The family are of Jamaican origin. His grandfather came to the UK from Jamaica in 1947 as part of the Windrush generation. Bailey said his grandfather fought for Britain in the Second World War. Bailey attended Henry Compton School in Fulham and left with five CSEs. When Bailey was twelve years old, his mother sent him to join the Army Cadet Force in White City. When he was about nineteen years old, he became a Sergeant-Instructor and stayed in the Cadets for another ten years. At about the age of twelve or thirteen, he began attending the Jubilee Sports Centre to take up gymnastics, and he became a member of Childs Hill Gymnastics Display team. After leaving secondary school, Bailey attended Paddington College, where he achieved two A-levels and a BTEC. Bailey was the subject of BBC Radio 4 series The House I Grew Up In, in which he said he had committed burglary in his youth and said: \\"I had a particular group of friends who indulged in a burglary. I had done it with them\\". Reflecting on gang culture, Bailey commented: \\"The problem of having estates with names is that people become very territorial. You kind of defend your \\"ends\\". Because you don't want your locale to be seen as where the pussies live.\\" Career before politics Bailey graduated at the age of 27 with a 2.2 in computer aided engineering from London South Bank University. Previously, he worked as a security guard at Wembley Stadium and the London Trocadero to fund his university tuition. He was unemployed for two years. Bailey said: \\"I did bad, bad jobs. I basically worked sweeping factories, delivering beer and security work\\". At least twelve members of his peer group spent time in prison. In May 2006, Bailey co-founded MyGeneration, a charity addressing the social problems that affect struggling young people and their families. It was established shortly before Bailey was selected by the Conservative Party to stand in the recreated Hammersmith constituency. In 2010, The Times reported that Bailey was at the centre of allegations that his North Kensington-based charity showed ¬£16,000 worth of spending \\"without any supporting records\\". Between 2008 and 2009, almost half of the charity's expenditure was on publicity and administration, not \\"direct charitable expenditure\\". Of the ¬£116,000 charitable expenditure, more than half was spent on travel and subsistence. The charity was closed in 2012 due to financial problems. The charity's services were taken over by other charities including Kids Company. Political career=Parliamentary candidate= On 29 March 2007, Bailey was selected at an open primary to be the Conservative candidate for the newly recreated parliamentary seat of Hammersmith in West London.CPS Press Release His campaign focused on issues surrounding families and social responsibility. He failed to win the seat at the 2010 general election, achieving a swing of 0.5% from Labour which was two points below the average swing across London, and lost by 3,549 votes. In the run-up to the 2015 general election, Bailey was unsuccessful in attempts to be chosen as the Conservative Party candidate for Kensington, Croydon South, and Uxbridge South and Ruislip. At the 2017 general election, Bailey contested Lewisham West and Penge, where he finished in second place with 12,249 votes. His share of the vote declined by 1.1 percentage points compared with 2010, against an average increase of 0.3 percentage points for the Conservatives across London.http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7186/CBP-7186.pdf =Researcher= Bailey was a Research Fellow at the Centre for Policy Studies,Centre for Policy Studies Website writing for the Centre and for various newspapers, including the Evening Standard, the Times, (Archived by ) and The Independent. =Government adviser= In 2011, Bailey was appointed as one of David Cameron's \\"Ambassadors for the Big Society\\". In 2012, he became a special adviser to the Prime Minister David Cameron on youth and crime. Bailey was paid a salary of ¬£60,000 as a special adviser. In 2013, he was moved to a part-time role in the Cabinet Office on a one-year contract and was paid substantially less. The Telegraph published claims he was pushed out of Downing Street by David Cameron's \\"clique of Old Etonian aides\\". =London Assembly= In October 2015, Bailey was selected as the third Conservative candidate on the London Assembly top-up list, after Kemi Badenoch and Andrew Boff. He is currently deputy leader of the Conservative Greater London Authority Group. =Other= Kensington Labour MP Emma Dent Coad provoked controversy after a blog she wrote about Bailey in 2010, before her election to the House of Commons, which referred to him as a \\"token ghetto boy\\". Dent Coad quoted former neighbours describing Bailey as a \\"free-loading scumbag\\" and \\"the most hated man in North Kensington\\". She suggested Bailey had been \\"used\\" by the Conservatives and that his \\"public school buddies will drop him like a hot potato\\" if he failed to get elected. Bailey subsequently called the comments \\"racist\\" and \\"hate-filled\\". Dent Coad later apologised for \\"any offence caused\\" and said that she was just repeating what others had said. In 2018, Bailey joined Havering NHS Trust‚Äôs board as part of a diversity scheme as a trainee. 2021 London mayoral election In 2018, Bailey was selected as the Conservative candidate for the upcoming London Mayoral election (then scheduled to be held in 2020 and later postponed until 2021). The Evening Standard newspaper endorsed Bailey for the Conservative candidacy, suggesting Bailey \\"had been both the embodiment and standard-bearer of Tory modernisation\\". Bailey was subject to racism during the campaign on social media and in a letter posted to a Conservative party office. Following his selection, Bailey was criticised for things he had written, said and shared on social media. He shared a tweet with an image with a caption describing Sadiq Khan, the incumbent mayor of London, as the \\"mad mullah of Londonistan\\". Bailey's spokesperson said he wouldn't have shared it if he had seen the caption. In October 2018, Bailey was accused of Islamophobia and Hinduphobia over the contents of a pamphlet entitled No Man‚Äôs Land, written for the Centre for Policy Studies in 2005. In it, Bailey said that celebrating Muslim and Hindu festivals \\"[robs] Britain of its community\\" and risked turning the country into a \\"crime riddled cesspool\\" as a result. He claimed that South Asians \\"bring their culture, their country and any problems they might have, with them\\" but that this was not a problem within the black community \\"because we‚Äôve shared a religion and in many cases a language\\". In the pamphlet, Bailey confused the Hindu religion and the Hindi language: \\"You don‚Äôt know what to do. You bring your children to school and they learn far more about Diwali than Christmas. I speak to the people who are from Brent and they‚Äôve been having Muslim and Hindi (sic) days off. James Cleverly, then the deputy chair of the Conservative Party, said that Bailey had been misunderstood and would not be sanctioned. = Mayoral Policies = Bailey promised to increase the size of London‚Äôs Metropolitan Police to 40,000 officers and introduce new ‚Äòstop and scan‚Äô technology that will use thermal imaging in knife crime hotspots, campaigned to reverse the increase in the Congestion Charge to ¬£15, plans to create a taxpayer-owned housebuilding organisation controlled by the Mayor, and plans to make every London bus electric by the end of his second term. In August 2020, he announced he would encourage larger businesses in London to anonymously drug test employees in an effort to reduce drug consumption and crime. In September 2020, Bailey proposed that companies should be able to pay to rename tube lines and stations with commercial brand names. Labour responded that the amount potentially raised over five years would be less than one month's Transport for London revenue. Political views Bailey has expressed concerns about liberalism, saying \\"the more liberal we have been, the more our communities have suffered\\". Bailey has accused BBC's output as being biased and went on to suggest the BBC \\"sees itself as propagandist for liberal values\\", and that the licence fee should be split with other broadcasters.Marsh , Marsh(2012). The Liberal Delusion:The Roots of Our Current Moral Crisis Arena Books. p. 116. In 2005, Bailey suggested that working class people \\"look to rules\\", otherwise they may turn to crime. In 2006, Bailey said \\"by giving children condoms and the amount of sexual material they are exposed to you normalise sex and they feel it is their divine right to have it, when actually it is not\\", and added \\"that is one of the things that drives their self-esteem up or down and leads to crime\\". It was later clarified that Bailey had not tried to suggest that access to abortions and contraceptive services had directly led to crime, however early sexual activity was a contributing factor to increased crime. Bailey has said that children are using abortion services as contraception and has favoured reducing the time limit from 24 weeks to 22 weeks. In an article in The Daily Telegraph in 2006, Bailey claimed that single mothers deliberately become pregnant in order to gain benefits, saying that they \\"won't be too careful about not becoming parents. In some cases, they will deliberately become pregnant - as they know that if they do, they will get a flat\\". At an event at a Conservative party conference in 2008, he repeated these claims, saying that \\"Girls getting knocked up to get housing? It‚Äôs a cottage industry where I come from.\\" Bailey has argued in support of allowing the police to have greater use of stop and search powers. Bailey has stated his support for greater equality for Black people. However, he is also critical of the Black Lives Matter movement, criticising it for wanting to \\"defund[] the police and smash[] up the nuclear family\\". He further commented that the movement \\"made everybody feel they are racist and actually very few people are.\\" Prior to Black Lives Matter protests that occurred in London in 2020 taking place, he argued that they should be allowed to happen, because otherwise the tension behind such protests \\"will just spill out into the summer and be very tough for the police\\". Personal life Bailey grew up in social housing with his Jamaican mother, grandfather, grandmother, two aunts, and two uncles. His extended family lived on the same estate in Ladbroke Grove. Following selection as Conservative's PPC for Hammersmith in 2007, Bailey and his immediate family moved out of social housing and Bailey at the time said \\"the mice and damp got a bit much\\". The couple live in a house owned jointly with a housing association. Bailey is married to Ellie with whom he has two children. He attends an Anglican church.

Gas lies in a Permian sandstone reservoir around below the seabed. The gasfield is operated by BP. History The gasfield was discovered in 1972 and it was named after HMS Amethyst. Between 1972 and 1985 a number of appraisal wells were drilled. The field development started in 1988 and the first gas was produced in 1991. Originally, the field was owned by BP, Enterprise Oil, British Gas, ARCO, Murphy Oil, Amerada Hess, and FINA. In 1997, BP acquired the interest of Enterprise Oil and became the largest stakeholder of the field. As a result of restructuring and several transactions the field became held by BP (59.5%), BG (24.15%), Centrica (8.95%), and Murphy Oil (7.4%). In December 2009, BP and BG agreed an assets swap by which BP took over BG's interest in the field. In September 2007, three crew members of the emergency response and rescue vessel Viking Islay, operated by Vroon Offshore Services, were killed during a support operation on the Amethyst gasfield. Production Production is performed using four small unmanned steel satellite wellhead platforms. The A1D platform and the A2D platform were built in 1989 by UiE Scotland in Glasgow, and have 5 and 6 wells respectively in Amethyst East. B1D and C1D were built in the following two years and currently produce from 4 and 7 wells in Amethyst East and Amethyst West respectively. C1D is connected to A1D and B1D is connected to A2D. All Amethyst daily operation and processing is carried out onshore. Personnel only travel to the platforms themselves for maintenance and well work.

The dish can be served as soup, deep fried or stir fried frog legs. Originally a Chinese dish, this dish is popular in Indonesia. The name \\"Swikee\\" is from Hokkian dialect (, ) sui (water) and ke (chicken), which is probably an euphemism to refer frogs as \\"water chicken\\". It is sometimes identified as a traditional food of Purwodadi, a city in Central Java, and Jatiwangi town in Majalengka, West Java. The main ingredient is frogs' legs (mainly from \\"green frogs\\") with the condiments of garlic, ginger and fermented soy paste (tauco), salt, and pepper. Once it is served, fried garlic and chopped celery may be added. Swikee is usually served with plain white rice. Description The taste and texture of frog meat is approximately between chicken and fish. They are often said to taste like chicken because of their mild flavor, with a texture most similar to chicken wings. However, some may perceive a slight fishiness. Normally, the legs are the only part served in the soup, since the legs are the most meaty parts; the skin of the frogs may, however, also be dried under the sun, and fried as chips. The salted fried frogs skin has a unique taste incomparable with other types of chips. Another type of frog cooking is \\"pepes kodok\\", frog cooked in pepes method, where the frog legs and different condiments are wrapped in banana leaves and put in a fire until cooked. The taste of the meat is enrichen with a distinct aroma of burned banana leaves. Frog-cooking is ubiquitous in Purwodadi, Grobogan Regency, Central Java, where it is the local delicacy. Frog leg cooking also can be found in the town of Jatiwangi, Majalengka Regency, West Java. It can also be found in the large cities of Indonesia, such as Jakarta, Cirebon and Bandung (where the most popular swikee restaurant chain is \\"Swikee Jatiwangi\\"), Yogyakarta, Semarang or Surabaya. Normally, a restaurant will use the name \\"Swikee Purwodadi\\" or \\"Swikee Jatiwangi\\" on its restaurant sign and menu. Currently Indonesia is the world's largest exporter of frog meat, exporting more than 5000 tonnes of frog meat each year, mostly to France, Belgium and Luxembourg.abc news: Appetite For Frogs' Legs Harming Wild Populations In the past, the frogs could be obtained from the wild, especially during rainy seasons. Lately, there are more and more farms that raise frogs due to increasing demand, especially from France.  Variations  Swike goreng mentega; stir-fried swikee in margarine sauce Swikee can be served in soup or stir fried according to the applied sauce. * Swikee oh or Kodok oh, frog legs in fermented soybean sauce (tauco) soup. * Swikee goreng mentega, stir fried frog legs in butter or margarine with Worcestershire sauce * Swikee kecap, stir fried frog legs in sweet soy sauce * Swikee saus tomat, stir fried frog legs in tomato sauce * Swikee asam manis, fried frog legs in sweet and sour sauce * Swikee goreng tepung, deep fried battered frog legs * Swikee goreng mayones, deep fried battered frog legs served with mayonnaise * Pepes swikee, seasoned boneless frog legs cooked in banana leaf as pepes, another variant is pepes telur kodok, the frog eggs cooked in banana leaf.  Issues  There are two main issues dealing with frog legs consumption in Indonesia; the religion, and environmental issues. Frog meat is considered haraam (non-halal) according to mainstream Islamic dietary laws. Frog meat fell under non-halal category on two prepositions; the meat to be consumed should not considered disgusting, and frogs together with ants, bees, and sea birds are animals that should not be killed by Muslims. The haraam status of frog legs had sparked controversy in Demak, where the official authority urged swikee restaurant owners not to associate swikee with Demak city, since it would tarnish Demak's image as the first Islamic city in Java, and is also opposed by its inhabitants that mainly follow the Safii school that forbids the consumption of frog.Tempo Online Bupati vs Kodok Within Islamic dietary law, there are some debates and differences about the consumption of frog legs. The mainstream Islamic madhhab (schools) of Safii, Hanafi, and Hanbali strictly forbid the consumption of frog. However, according to the Maliki school certain types of frogs are allowed to be consumed;Konsultasi Syariah namely the green frog commonly found in ricefields, while other species especially with blistered skin are considered poisonous, unclean and disgusting and should not be consumed. Environment activists have urged restrictions on frog consumption ‚Äî especially frogs harvested from the wild ‚Äî because frogs are an essential element of the ecosystem. Conservationists have warned that frogs could be going the same way as the cod ‚Äî gastronomic demand is depleting regional populations to the point of no return. Like most amphibians, frogs with their thin and moist skin are sensitive to environmental changes and pollution. The population of amphibians is threatened and declining globally due to habitat degradation, environmental destruction, and pollution.

His competitive debut came in a Premier Division match against Clydebank at Kilbowie Park on 2 May 1978. He went on to be a first team regular over the next six seasons. Originally a central defender, he came to play more regularly as a full back and occasionally in midfield. His goal against Morton in March 1979 was included in the BBC's Goal of the Season competition. Stark won two Scottish League Cup winner's medals early in his career. He played in both matches of the 1979 final against Aberdeen and was an unused substitute in the 1980 final against Dundee.

She later became a nun. She is considered to be the first female student and teacher in Poland. Overview The story of her was first told by the abbot Martin of Leibitz (d. 1464) in Vienna in about 1429. There are several different versions of the legend. According to one version, she was a daughter of a teacher in a church school in Gniezno, schooled by her father, who decided to continue her studies using any means necessary. According to another version, she was a girl who inherited a fortune when orphaned. In yet another variant of the story (\\"[this] claim is as well documented as any other\\") she came from Dobrzy≈Ñ nad Wis≈ÇƒÖ. In any case, dressed as a boy, she enrolled at the University of Krak√≥w in the name of Andrzej (or Jakub; two versions of the name she used are reported). At that time it was forbidden for women to attend universities. Discovery Nawojka successfully fooled everyone and studied for two years, making herself a name as a great scholar and a serious student. According to a possibly later addition to the story, she was offered work as a domestic assistant to one of the professors, but declined: at the time servants were expected to accompany their masters to the public bath. One day, she was exposed as a woman. The versions differ here again: according to one, two soldiers wagered that the student walking by was in fact a woman, and exposed her; according to the second, she was found by a son of w√≥jt from Gniezno who joined the school; according to the third one, she fell ill and a doctor examining her found out the truth. When she was brought before the authorities to explain why she had disguised her gender, she simply answered: \\"For the will of learning\\". When they interrogated her fellow-students and professors they could find no one to accuse her of immoral conduct. Her record as a student was excellent. She was not convicted of any crime, but the judges did not want to acquit her entirely. According to Martin of Leibitz, she asked to be taken to a convent. She took her vows there, became a teacher and a leader of the convent school, and eventually the abbess. This story may or may not be true. Some historians say that if it is true, her time at the university was about 1407‚Äì1409. Legacy The Jagiellonian University did not allow women to study until 1897, \\"in 1897 first female students were admitted to study pharmacy\\" from: and to hold academic positions until 1906. The university's first women's dormitory, opened in 1936, was named after Nawojka. One of the streets in Krak√≥w is also named after her.

It usually takes place at around 10:30 on weekdays. The questions are devised by radio producer and music collector Phil \\"The Collector\\" Swern. Structure Two contestants play against each other for the chance to win a DAB digital radio. Each contestant is asked ten questions based on popular music from the 1950s through to the present day. Correct answers to the questions are worth three points, other than for the third, sixth and ninth \\"bonus\\" questions on a topic chosen by the contestant, from two options offered by the host prior to the start of the quiz. The bonus questions involve listening to a snippet of music and, if answered correctly, are worth six points. There is, therefore, a maximum total of thirty-nine points on offer. The winning contestant then goes on to play \\"Three-in-Ten\\". In this part of the quiz they have ten seconds to name three UK Singles Chart hits for a particular artist or group named by Ken Bruce. If they successfully manage this they win the DAB digital radio; if they fail, they win a Bluetooth speaker. However, if a contestant scores thirty-nine points in the main round, they win the Digital Radio anyway, and the other contestant would play Three- in-Ten instead. Should both contestants score the same number of points (and the score is less than the maximum), a tie-break is used to decide who will play Three-in-Ten. A \\"One Year Out\\" t-shirt is given to the losing contestant, so-designed because when answering \\"Name the Year\\" type questions, contestants are very often just one year out, causing Ken to exclaim \\"One year out!\\". One Year Out t-shirts are often heard to be accepted by contestants as a desirable consolation. At the end of the year, the best contestants (those who score thirty-nine points, or thirty-six points and also win the \\"Three-in-Ten\\") return for a \\"Champions League PopMaster\\", the structure of which is different. The contestants start with their original score from their first appearance, and then proceed to answer ten questions which are worth their ordinal values i.e. question 1 is worth one point, question 2 is worth two points and so on. The contestants still choose a bonus subject, but this is only worth its value in the order of the questions. The score is then added to their original score, and the highest-scoring two contestants return for a final to determine the year's champion. When Bruce is on holiday, PopMaster continues with stand-in presenters; these have included Alex Lester, Stuart Maconie, Michael Ball, Claudia Winkleman, Richard Allinson, Aled Jones, Zo√´ Ball, Fearne Cotton, Sara Cox, Trevor Nelson, Gary Davies,and Jo Whiley. 2007 suspension and celebrity version PopMaster was suspended for one day on 19 July 2007 in line with the BBC's blanket ban on television and radio competitions following several phone-in scandals (although PopMaster or other competitions on Radio 2 were never implicated).BBC suspends phone competitions BBC.co.uk The day after, PopMaster was brought back but without prizes or public entry; the contestants selected from celebrities and BBC staff. Between 20 July 2007 and 18 January 2008, when the quiz was played with celebrity contestants, prizes were not given away, and the final Three in Ten round was not played. It was rumoured that members of the public would be able to play again before Christmas 2007, though this did not happen.The Guardian - BBC phone-in contests return - with new rulesPetersfield Post - Phone-ins to resume after scandalsRadio 2 website - Celebrity PopMaster On 30 December 2007 it was announced that the quiz would be one of the first BBC phone-in competitions to return in January 2008.News.BBC.co.uk - BBC news story The quiz returned on Monday, 21 January 2008. New background music and dramatic, orchestral and guitar based jingles for the quiz were introduced on the same day. The contestant application procedure reverted to the original write-in method, but now prospective contestants are invited on the day.BBC - Radio 2 - Ken Bruce - PopMaster - Radio How to apply for PopMaster on the radio On 28 May 2010, Bruce hosted a special Eurovision celebrity edition of the quiz, live from Oslo, Norway. Eurovision Song Contest commentator for BBC Three, Paddy O'Connell, took on the author of The Eurovision Song Contest - The Official History, John Kennedy O'Connor, to answer questions on the contest, with O'Connor winning. On 25 May 2012, a second Eurovision celebrity edition of the quiz was hosted live from Baku, Azerbaijan. The BBC's Moscow Correspondent, Steve Rosenberg, narrowly lost to O'Connor. A third \\"Eurovision Popmaster\\" was held live on 17 May 2013 from Malmo, Sweden, on the eve of the Eurovision Song Contest 2013, with Bruce competing against Paddy O'Connell and John Kennedy O'Connor chairing the quiz. On Bank Holiday Monday, 25 May 2020, Bruce hosted an All-Day tournament of the quiz, with radio personalities playing against the usual members of the public. There were 8 heats, 2 semi- finals and a grand final, between 7:30am and 5:30pm. For this version, contestants could pick up the normal 39 points, with an extra 5 being given for successfully completing the 3 in 10 round. Online An interactive version of PopMaster was launched on Monday 1 March 2010. The game can now be played on the BBC Radio 2 web and mobile sites, or in a Facebook application.BBC - Radio 2 - Ken Bruce - PopMaster PopMaster Online Game The game features text, image, sound and video questions, and scores are determined by how quickly the player answers correctly. A voiceover from Ken Bruce features throughout the game. Players can also challenge friends to beat their high scores. The maximum score possible is 39. Since Monday 29 October 2018, PopMaster has been available as a podcast for 30 days after broadcast.BBC - Radio 2 - PopMaster - Downloads The podcast edits out some personal details of the contestants for privacy reasons. Instead, at the end of the podcast episode, Ken reads out a selection of listener emails from after the live broadcast. Other PopMaster was parodied by comedian and BBC 6 Music presenter Jon Holmes on his weekend show in the game Ken Bruce Master. The game is described thus: \\"On PopMaster listeners have to answer questions about pop stars. On Ken Bruce Master pop stars have to answer questions about Ken Bruce.\\" Very surreal questions then follow, in the style of Chuck Norris facts. Many pop and rock stars have played the game for \\"no prizes whatsoever due to current compliance guidelines.\\" At Christmas 2007 Ken Bruce himself played, and lost. The format of PopMaster is similar to that of David Hamilton's Music Game which ran on his Radio 2 show in the late 1970s and early to mid-1980s. For the intervening period, there was no such phone competition on Radio 2 largely owing to the impact of Frances Line on the station's music policy.

It is believed that around 1850 an estate was established on the top of the hill and near to a river named as Sooryakanthi. Due to lack of sun light, many labors fell in ill and died. Later the management has changed the location and came down and established the estate in the present location. The laborers had been brought from southern Tamil Nadu and their descendants still live in the estate. Lower- priced tea imports following the implementation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade pushed the estate into losses. The estate was taken over by a bank and the plantation was shut down after the owner failed to repay the loan on the estate. The families were provided with free ration by the State Government. In 2014, the State Government Labour department convinced the estate management to reopen the estate but the employees were neither paid salary nor the free ration after that.

Life  Caspar Isenkrahe grew up without a father, who died before Caspar's birth. Isenkrahe visited in 1856 the Progymnasium in J√ºlich, in 1857 the Marzellengymnasium in Cologne and from 1858 to 1863 the Realprogymnasium in Bonn. In 1868 he studied at the University of Bonn where he chose the subjects mathematics, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, philosophy, Latin and German. On 31 July 1866 he made his PhD with an award-winning work about the anatomy of Helicina titanica, a species of snail. He became a teaching authority as a senior primary school teacher (pro facultate docendi) on 26 February 1869 for his chosen courses. After a probationary year 1869/1870 at the high school of Bonn, he worked at the high school of Krefeld (at least to 1878) and then at the Realprogymnasium in Bonn. In the hope to be able to change to a high school career at the mathematical faculty at the University of Bonn he sent a habilitation document. The faculty approved his plan but it failed because of the Berlin government for reasons unconnected with the subject. A later attempt to receive a lectureship at the technical University of Braunschweig also failed. From 1893 to 1911 he was working as a high school professor at Trier until his retirement. Until his death in 1921 he was actively engaged in the fields of mathematics, physics and natural philosophy. He corresponded with well-known mathematicians and physicists, such as Hermann von Helmholtz, Heinrich Hertz, Felix Klein and Philipp Lenard. Because of his unusual scientific creativity and versatility the philosophical faculty of the University of Bonn honoured him demonstratively on the occasion of his golden doctoral anniversary with the renewal of his doctor dignity on 31 July 1916. Caspar Isenkrahe died after serious physical sufferings on 12 August 1921. His legacy is kept safe in Trier (to be more precise partly in the town archives and partly in the diocese archives). The partial papers I (size: 0.5 meters) in the town archives of Trier includes correspondences, poems, clay creations, manuscripts as well as different collections from the cultural life around the time of the turn of 19th to the 20th century. The partial papers II (size: 2.50 meters) in the diocese archives includes personal documents, works, a biography as well as additional correspondence.  Work  Isenkrahe always had a special inclination towards mathematics and produced a row of publications in the field of abstract mathematics. In particular his works around the theory of the prime numbers were appreciated. The question of infinity fascinated him in the field of the Philosophy of nature.Isenkrahe, C.

As educationalist and religious Roman Catholic he felt obliged to give a proof of the existence of God on a natural philosophical basis. He also considered it to be necessary to examine the paranormal phenomena which were issued by the Roman Catholic Church as a 'miracle'. He dealt increasingly with experimental theology later. In a book written in 1921 he tried to mediate in the debate around the theory of relativity, which had partly been led by both sides by scientifically inadmissible means.Isenkrahe, C.

A specialist wicket-keeper, he found little success as a right- handed batsman, scoring just 19 runs in four innings with a best of 14. Aspinall was born in Elland, Yorkshire. Picked for his first match against Surrey at the Oval in August 1880, Aspinall made his highest first-class score in his first knock from the lowly position of number 10, as Yorkshire compiled thanks to skipper George Ulyett's 141. Surrey were dismissed for 176 and 99, with Aspinall taking a catch in the second innings, to win by an innings and 123 runs. Aspinall retained his place for the next match, against Middlesex County Cricket Club at Bramall Lane. Runs eluded him as Yorkshire crashed to a comprehensive six wicket defeat, and he failed to take a catch or effect a stumping. Yorkshire never selected him again. He had also appeared for Halifax, in a non first-class game against 'The Gentlemen of Canada', in a two-day game on 28 and 29 June 1880. He found no greater form at the crease in this game, being bowled by Wright for three in Halifax's 114, and again falling to the same bowler in the same manner, for a duck second time around. Despite his failures at number 9 in the order, Halifax managed to draw the game. His final first-class appearance was for the 'Under 30 XI', against W.G. Grace's 'Over 30 XI', at Lord's at the end of May 1882. Aspinall once again kept wicket, and although he scored just three runs in his only innings, his team enjoyed a comprehensive ten wicket win over their elders. Aspinall showed his skills behind the timbers, by taking four catches on his final first-class appearance.

Based on their primary use, packers can be divided into two main categories: production packers and service packers. Production packers are those that remain in the well during well production. Service packers are used temporarily during well service activities such as cement squeezing, acidizing, fracturing and well testing. It is usually run in close to the bottom end of the production tubing and set at a point above the top perforations or sand screens. In wells with multiple reservoir zones, packers are used to isolate the perforations for each zone. In these situations, a sliding sleeve would be used to select which zone to produce. Packers may also be used to protect the casing from pressure and produced fluids, isolate sections of corroded casing, casing leaks or squeezed perforations, and isolate or temporarily abandon producing zones. In water-flooding developments in which water is injected into the reservoir, packers are used in injection wells to isolate the zones into which the water must be injected. There are occasions in which running a packer may not be desirable. For example, high volume wells that are produced both up the tubing and annulus will not include a packer. Rod pumped wells are not normally run with packers because the associated gas is produced up the annulus. In general, well completions may not incorporate a packer when the annular space is used as a production conduit. A production packer is designed to grip and seal against the casing ID. Gripping is accomplished with metal wedges called \\"slips.\\" These components have sharpened, carburized teeth that dig into the metal of the casing. Sealing is accomplished with large, cylindrical rubber elements. In situations where the sealed pressure is very high (above 5,000 psi), metal rings are used on either side of the elements to prevent the rubber from extruding. A packer is run in the casing on production tubing or wireline. Once the desired depth is reached, the slips and element must be expanded out to contact the casing. Axial loads are applied to push the slips up a ramp and to compress the element, causing it to expand outward. The axial loads are applied either hydraulically, mechanically, or with a slow burning chemical charge. Most packers are \\"permanent\\" and require milling in order to remove them from the casing. The main advantages of permanent packers are lower cost and greater sealing and gripping capabilities. In situations where a packer must be easily removed from the well, such as secondary recoveries, re-completions, or to change out the production tubing, a retrievable packer must be used. To unset the tool, either a metal ring is sheared or a sleeve is shifted to disengage connecting components. Retrievable packers have a more complicated design and generally lower sealing and gripping capabilities, but after removal and subsequent servicing, they can be reused. Applications * Casing protection * Separation of multiple zones * Isolation packers * Elimination of surging and heading * Sub-surface safety control * Artificial/gas lift There are three types of packers: mechanical and hydraulic set and permanent. All packers fall into one or a combination of these. Mechanical set packers are set by some form of tubing movement, usually a rotation or upward /downward motion. Others can be weight set‚Äîthe tubing weight can be used to compress and expand the sealing element. By a simple up string pull the packer is released. It is used best in shallow low pressure wells that are straight. It is not designed to withstand pressure differences unless a hydraulic hold down is incorporated. Tension-set packers are set by pulling a tension on the tubing, slacking off releases the packer. Good for shallow wells with moderate pressure differences. The lower pressure helps to increase the setting force on the packer. Used in a stimulation well. Rotation-set packer ‚Äì Tubing rotation is used to set the packer to mechanically lock it in; a left-hand turn engages and a right-hand turn retrieves it. Hydraulic-set packers use fluid pressure to drive the cone behind the slips. Once set they remain set by the use of either entrapped pressure or a mechanical lock. They are released by picking up the tubing. They are good for used in deviated or crooked holes where tubing movement is restricted or unwanted. The tubing can be hung in neutral tension. Inflatable packers \\\\- use fluid pressure to inflate a long cylindrical tube of reinforced rubber to set the packer. Frequently used for open hole testing in exploration wells and for cement assurance in production wells. Also used in wells where the packer must pass through a restriction and then set at a much larger diameter in casing or open holes. Many variations for specific applications are available including those capable of withstanding high pressure differentials. Permanent packers are run and set on an electric wireline, drill pipe or tubing. Opposed slips are positioned to lock it in compression. Once set this packer is resistant to motion for either direction. Wireline uses an electric current to detonate an explosive charge to set the packer. A release stud then frees the assembly form the packer. Tubing can be used by applying rotation or a pull or a combination of both. They are good in wells that have high pressure differentials or large tubing load variations and can be set precisely. They can be set the deepest. Cement packers ‚Äì In this case the tubing is cemented in place inside the casing or open hole. This type of packer is cheap. Factors affecting packers Temperature and pressure can affect how the tubing and the packer behave as this could cause changes in the packer and tubing expansion rates. If the packer allows free motion then the tubing can elongate or shorten. If not the tensile and compressive forces can develop within.Dorohov M., Kostryba I, Biletskyi V.

Resources can broadly be classified upon their availability ‚Äî they are classified into renewable and non-renewable resources. They can also be classified as actual and potential on the basis of the level of development and use, on the basis of origin they can be classified as biotic and abiotic, and on the basis of their distribution, as ubiquitous and localised (private, community-owned , natural and international resources). An item becomes a resource with time and developing technology. The benefits of resource utilization may include increased wealth, proper functioning of a system, or enhanced well-being. From a human perspective, a natural resource is anything obtained from the environment to satisfy human needs and wants.WanaGopa - Nyawakan From a broader biological or ecological perspective, a resource satisfies the needs of a living organism (see biological resource). The concept of resources has been developed across many established areas of work, in economics, biology and ecology, computer science, management, and human resources for example - linked to the concepts of competition, sustainability, conservation, and stewardship. In application within human society, commercial or non-commercial factors require resource allocation through resource management. Economic In economics a resource is defined as a service or other asset used to produce goods and services that meet human needs and wants.McConnell, C.R., S.L. Brue, and S.M. Flynn. 2011. Economics: Principles, Problems, and policies, 19th ed. McGraw-Hill/Irwin, New York, NY. . Economics itself has been defined as the study of how society manages and allocates its scarce resources.Mankiw, N.G. 2008. Principles of Economics, 5th ed. south-western College Publishing, Boston, MA. . Classical economics recognizes three categories of resources, also referred to as factors of production: land, labor, and capital.Samuelson, P.A. and W.D. Nordhaus. 2004. Economics, 18th ed. McGraw-Hill/Irwin, Boston, MA. . Land includes all natural resources and is viewed as both the site of production and the source of raw materials. Labour or human resources consists of human effort provided in the creation of products, paid in wage. Capital consists of human-made goods or means of production (machinery, buildings, and other infrastructure) used in the production of other goods and services, paid in interest. Biological In biology and ecology a resource is defined as a substance that is required by a living organism for normal growth, maintenance, and reproduction (see biological resource). The main essential resources for animals are food, water, and territory. For plants, key resources include sunlight, nutrients, water, and a place to grow. Resources can be consumed by an organism and, as a result, become unavailable to other organisms. Competition for resource varies from complete symmetric (all individuals receive the same amount of resources, irrespective of their size) to perfectly size symmetric (all individuals exploit the same amount of resource per unit biomass) to absolutely size- asymmetric (the largest individuals exploit all the available resource). The degree of size asymmetry has major effects on the structure and diversity of ecological communities, e.g. in plant communities size-asymmetric competition for light has stronger effects on diversity compared with competition for soil resources. The degree of size asymmetry has major effects on the structure and diversity of ecological communities. =Economic versus biological= There are three fundamental differences between economic versus ecological views: 1) the economic resource definition is human-centered (anthropocentric) and the biological or ecological resource definition is nature-centered (biocentric or ecocentric); 2) the economic view includes desire along with necessity, whereas the biological view is about basic biological needs; and 3) economic systems are based on markets of currency exchanged for goods and services, whereas biological systems are based on natural processes of growth, maintenance, and reproduction. Computer resources A computer resource is any physical or virtual component of limited availability within a computer or information management system. Computer resources include means for input, processing, output, communication, and storage.Morley, D. 2010. Understanding Computers: Today and Tomorrow, 13th ed. Course Technology, Stamford, CT. . Natural Natural resources are derived from the environment. Many natural resources are essential for human survival, while others are used for satisfying human desire. Conservation is management of natural resources with the goal of sustainability. Natural resources may be further classified in different ways. Resources can be categorized on the basis of origin: * Abiotic resources comprise non-living things (e.g., land, water, air and minerals such as gold, iron, copper, silver). * Biotic resources are obtained from the biosphere. Forests and their products, animals, birds and their products, fish and other marine organisms are important examples. Minerals such as coal and petroleum are sometimes included in this category because they were formed from fossilized organic matter, though over long periods of time. Natural resources are also categorized based on the stage of development: * Potential resources are known to exist and may be used in the future. For example, petroleum may exist in many parts of India and Kuwait that have sedimentary rocks, but until the time it is actually drilled out and put into use, it remains a potential resource. * Actual resources are those that have been surveyed, their quantity and quality determined, and are being used in present times. For example, petroleum and natural gas is actively being obtained from the Mumbai High Fields. The development of an actual resource, such as wood processing depends upon the technology available and the cost involved. That part of the actual resource that can be developed profitably with available technology is known as a reserve resource, while that part that can not be developed profitably because of lack of technology is known as a stock resource. Natural resources can be categorized on the basis of renewability: * Non-renewable resources are formed over very long geological periods. Minerals and fossils are included in this category. Since their rate of formation is extremely slow, they cannot be replenished, once they are depleted. Out of these, the metallic minerals can be re-used by recycling them, but coal and petroleum cannot be recycled. * Renewable resources, such as forests and fisheries, can be replenished or reproduced relatively quickly. The highest rate at which a resource can be used sustainably is the sustainable yield. Some resources, such as sunlight, air, and wind, are called perpetual resources because they are available continuously, though at a limited rate. Their quantity is not affected by human consumption. Many renewable resources can be depleted by human use, but may also be replenished, thus maintaining a flow. Some of these, such as agricultural crops, take a short time for renewal; others, such as water, take a comparatively longer time, while still others, such as forests, take even longer. Dependent upon the speed and quantity of consumption, overconsumption can lead to depletion or total and everlasting destruction of a resource. Important examples are agricultural areas, fish and other animals, forests, healthy water and soil, cultivated and natural landscapes. Such conditionally renewable resources are sometimes classified as a third kind of resource, or as a subtype of renewable resources. Conditionally renewable resources are presently subject to excess human consumption and the only sustainable long term use of such resources is within the so-called zero ecological footprint, where in human use less than the Earth's ecological capacity to regenerate. Natural resources are also categorized based on distribution: * Ubiquitous resources are found everywhere (for example air, light, and water). * Localized resources are found only in certain parts of the world (for example metal ores and geothermal power). Actual vs. potential natural resources are distinguished as follows: * Actual resources are those resources whose location and quantity are known and we have the technology to exploit and use them. * Potential resources are the ones of which we have insufficient knowledge or we do not have the technology to exploit them at present. On the basis of ownership, resources can be classified as individual, community, national, and international. Labour or human resources In economics, labor or human resources refers to the human effort in the production of goods and rendering of services. Human resources can be defined in terms of skills, energy, talent, abilities, or knowledge. In a project management context, human resources are those employees responsible for undertaking the activities defined in the project plan. Capital or infrastructure In social studies, capital refers to already-produced durable goods used in production of goods or services. In essence, capital refers to human-made resources created using knowledge and expertise based on utility or perceived value. Common examples of capital include buildings, machinery, railways, roads, and ships. As resources, capital goods may or may not be significantly consumed, though they may depreciate in the production process and they are typically of limited capacity or unavailable for use by others.  Tangible versus intangible  Whereas, tangible resources such as equipment have an actual physical existence, intangible resources such as corporate images, brands and patents, and other intellectual properties exist in abstraction.Berry, John. 2004. Tangible Strategies for Intangible Assets. McGraw-Hill. .  Resources versus reserves  In interdisciplinary life course studies, three characteristics have been proposed to distinguish between resources and reserves: 1) reserves are potential means (for future use), resources are for immediate use 2) sufficient resources at a given developmental period are the necessary condition for the constitution and maintenance of reserves 3) the function of resources is to ensure the daily or short-term functioning of individuals, the function of reserves is to protect against shocks or against the negative effect of aging.  Use and sustainable development  Typically resources cannot be consumed in their original form, but rather through resource development they must be processed into more usable commodities and usable things. With the increasing population, the demand for resources is increasing. There are marked differences in resource distribution and associated economic inequality between regions or countries, with developed countries using more natural resources than developing countries. Sustainable development is a pattern of resource use, that aims to meet human needs while preserving the environment. Sustainable development means that we should exploit our resources carefully to meet our present requirement without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The practice of the three R's ‚Äì reduce, reuse and recycle must be followed in order to save and extend the availability of resources. Various problems relate to the usage of resources: * Environmental degradation * Over-consumption * Resource curse * Resource depletion * Tragedy of the commons * Myth of superabundance Various benefits can result from the wise usage of resources: * Economic growth * Ethical consumerism * Prosperity * Quality of life * Sustainability * Wealth See also * Natural resource management * Resource-based view * Resource slack *Waste management *Social reserves References External links  * Category:Resource economics Category:Ecology ","title":"Resource"},{"id":"10368244","text":"Babeni is a town and union council of Mardan District in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.Tehsils & Unions in the District of Mardan - Government of Pakistan it is about 6‚Äì7 km away from the main city of mardan on swabi road there is a way towards north-west that leads to babini on the way to babeni there are many villages as ijara kalay, shaamelaat and many others.

The site, located on a hill, was known initially by its Arabic name Sheikh Ibreik or Sheikh Abreik, purchased by the Jewish National Fund, and which historical geographer Samuel Klein in 1936 identified as Talmudic Beit She'arim.. See also p. 137 in: . In the Jerusalem Talmud (Kila'im 9:3), the town's name is written in an elided-consonant form, (), which follows more closely the Greek transliteration in Josephus' Vita ¬ß 24, (). The partially excavated archaeological site consists mainly of an extensive necropolis of rock-cut tombs and some remains of the town itself. The site is managed by the National Parks Authority. It borders the town of Kiryat Tiv'on on the northeast and is located five kilometres west of Moshav Beit She'arim.Modern Bet She'arim Jewish Virtual Library It is situated 20 km east of Haifa in the southern foothills of the Lower Galilee. In 2015, the necropolis was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The town's vast necropolis is carved out of soft limestone and contains more than 30 burial cave systems. Although only a portion of the necropolis has been excavated, it has been likened to a book inscribed in stone. Its catacombs, mausoleums, and sarcophagi are adorned with elaborate symbols and figures as well as an impressive quantity of incised and painted inscriptions in Hebrew, Aramaic, Palmyrene, and Greek, documenting two centuries of historical and cultural achievement. The wealth of artistic adornments contained in this, the most ancient extensive Jewish cemetery in the world, is unparalleled anywhere., UNESCO world heritage site, Name According to Moshe Sharon, following Yechezkel Kutscher, the name of the city was Beit She'arayim or Kfar She'arayim (the House/Village of Two Gates).Sharon, Moshe (2004), Corpus Inscriptionum Arabicarum Palaestinae, Vol. III, D‚ÄìF; page XXXVII The ancient Yemenite Jewish pronunciation of the name is also \\"Bet She'arayim\\", which is more closely related to the Ancient Greek rendition of the name, i.e. ŒíŒ∑œÉŒ¨œÅŒ±, \\"Besara\\".Babylonian Talmud, Punctuated (), ed. Yosef Amar, Jerusalem 1980, s.v. Sanhedrin 32b (Hebrew) The popular orthography for the Hebrew word for house, , is \\"beit\\", while the traditional King James one is \\"beth\\", the effort being now to replace both with the etymologically better suited \\"bet\\". History=Iron Age= Pottery shards discovered at the site indicate that a first settlement there dates back to the Iron Age. =Second Temple period= Two lions facing each other, a Greek mythological scene decorating a sarcophagus in the Cave of the Coffins Beit She'arayim was founded at the end of the 1st century BCE, during the reign of King Herod.Benjamin Mazar, Beth She'arim : Report on the Excavations during 1936‚Äì1940, Vol. I, p. 19. The Roman Jewish historian Josephus Flavius, in his Vita, referred to the city in Greek as Besara, the administrative center of the estates of Queen Berenice in the Jezreel Valley. =Roman and Byzantine periods= Benjamin Mazar described it as a prosperous Jewish town eventually destroyed by fire in 352, at the end of the Jewish revolt against Gallus and that after some time it was renewed as a Byzantine city, but more recent research shows that the Gallus revolt had a much lesser impact on the town. The Galilee earthquake of 363 did damage Bet She'arayim, but without long- lasting effects. After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, the Sanhedrin (Jewish legislature and supreme council) migrated from place to place, first going into Jabneh, then into Usha, from there into Shefar'am, and thence into Beit She'arayim.Babylonian Talmud (Rosh Hashanah 31a‚Äìb) The town is mentioned in rabbinical literature as an important center of Jewish learning during the 2nd century. Rabbi Judah the Prince (Yehudah HaNasi), head of the Sanhedrin and compiler of the Mishna, lived there. In the last seventeen years of his life, he moved to Sepphoris for health reasons, but planned his burial in Beit She'arim. According to tradition, he owned there land he received as a gift from his friend, the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus. The most desired burial place for Jews was the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, but in 135 CE, when Jews were barred from the area, Beit She'arim became an alternative.The Holy Land: An Oxford archaeological guide, From earliest times to 1700, Jerome Murphy-O'Connor The fact that Rabbi Judah was interred there led many other Jews from all over the country and from the Jewish Diaspora, from nearby Phoenicia to far-away Himyar in Yemen,H. Z. Hirschberg, YisrƒÅ‚Äôƒìl ba-‚ÄòArƒÅb, Tel Aviv 1946, pp. 53‚Äì57, 148, 283‚Äì284 (Hebrew) to be buried next to his grave. While it was originally thought that Bet She'arayim was destroyed during the Jewish revolt against Gallus in the mid-4th century, recent research has revealed the destruction to be far less extensive. An earthquake in 386 caused some damage, but the town recovered and enjoyed prosperity during the era of Byzantine rule. Almost 300 inscriptions primarily in Greek, but also in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Palmyrene were found on the walls of the catacombs containing numerous sarcophagi. =Early Islamic period= From the beginning of the Early Islamic period (7th century), settlement was sparse.Mazar, p. 20. Excavations uncovered 75 lamps dating to the period of Umayyad (7th-8th centuries) and Abassid (8th‚Äì13th centuries) rule over Palestine. A large Abbasid-period glassmaking facility from the 9th century was also found at the site (see below). =Crusader period= There is some evidence of activity in the former city area and necropolis dating to the Crusader period (12th century), probably connected to travellers and temporary settlement. =Ottoman period= A small Arab village called Sheikh Bureik was located here at least from the late 16th century.H√ºtteroth, Wolf-Dieter; Abdulfattah, Kamal (1977), Historical Geography of Palestine, Transjordan and Southern Syria in the Late 16th Century. Erlanger Geographische Arbeiten, Sonderband, Erlangen, Germany: Vorstand der Fr√§nkischen Geographischen Gesellschaft, p. 158. A map by Pierre Jacotin from Napoleon's invasion of 1799 showed the place, named as Cheik Abrit.Karmon, 1960, p. 163 The village is mentioned again in Conder's and Kitchener's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP), citing data from 1859,Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 273 and in 1875 by Victor Gu√©rin.Gu√©rin, 1880, pp. 395‚Äì397 In 1872, the Ottoman authorities sold Shayk Abreik (together with a total of 23 villages and some seventy square miles of land) for ¬£20,000 to the Sursuk family of Lebanon.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 356 The Survey of Western Palestine, published in 1881, describes Sheikh Abreik as a small village situated on a hill with a conspicuous maqam (sanctuary, holy tomb) located to the south. The village houses were made mostly of mud, and it belonged to the Sursuk family. The population at this time was estimated to be around 150. During World War I, the \\"finest oaks\\" of Sheikh Bureik were \\"ruthlessly destroyed\\" by the Turkish Army for use as rail fuel.Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, report of 1923, quoted by R. El-Eini, British forestry policy in Mandate Palestine 1929‚Äì48: Aims and realities, Middle Eastern Studies, Vol. 35, 1999, pp. 72‚Äì155. =British Mandate= The October 1922 census of Palestine recorded Sheikh Abreik with a population of 111 Muslims.Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub- district of Haifa, p. 33 At some time during the early 1920s, the Sursuk family sold the lands of the village to the Jewish National Fund, via Yehoshua Hankin, a Zionist activist who was responsible for most of the major land purchases of the World Zionist Organization in Ottoman Palestine.Avneri, 1984, p. 122In 1925, according to List of villages sold by Sursocks and their partners to the Zionists since British occupation of Palestine, evidence to the Shaw Commission, 1930 After the sale, which included lands from the Arab villages of Harithiya, Sheikh Abreik and Harbaj, a total of 59 Arab tenants were evicted from the three villages, with 3,314 pounds compensation paid.Kenneth W. Stein, The Land Question in Palestine, 1917‚Äì1939, p. 60 In 1925 an agricultural settlement also named Sheikh Abreik was established by the Hapoel HaMizrachi, a Zionist political party and settlement movement.Universal Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol. 6, entry \\"Colonies, Agricultural\\", p. 287. Archaeology Visitors at the Cave of the Coffins The archaeological importance of the site was recognized in the 1880s by the Survey of Western Palestine, which explored many tombs and catacombs but did no excavation.Survey of Western Palestine, Vol. I, pp. 325‚Äì328, 343‚Äì351 In 1936, Alexander Za√Ød, employed by the JNF as a watchman, reported that he had found a breach in the wall of one of the caves which led into another cave decorated with inscriptions.Mazar, p27. In the 1930s and 1950s, the site was excavated by Benjamin Mazar and Nahman Avigad. As late as 2014, the system of burial caves at Beit She'arim was still being explored and excavated.Israel Antiquities Authority, Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2014, Survey Permit # A-7008. This survey was conducted by Tsvika Tsuk, Yosi Bordovitz, and Achia Cohen-Tavor, on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA). =Jewish necropolis= A total of 21 catacombs have so far been discovered in the Beit She'arim necropolis, almost all containing a main hall with recesses in the wall (loculi) and sarcophagi that once contained the remains of the dead. These have since been removed, either by grave-robbers, or by Atra Kadisha, the governmental body responsible for the reburial of exhumed bones at archaeological sites. Most of the remains date from the 2nd to 4th century CE. Close to 300 sepulchral inscriptions have been discovered at the necropolis, most of which engraved in Greek uncials, and a few in Hebrew and Aramaic. Geographical references in these inscriptions reveal that the necropolis was used by people from the town of Beit She'arim, from elsewhere in Galilee, and even from cities as far away as Palmyra (in Syria) and Tyre.The Oxford encyclopedia of Archaeology in the Near East considers Beth She'arim of international importance (Volume 1, p. 309-11); Tessa Rajak considers its importance regional (\\"The rabbinic dead and the Diaspora dead at Beth She‚Äôarim\\" in P. Sch√§fer (ed.), The Talmud Yerushalmi and Graeco-Roman culture 1 (T√ºbingen 1997), pp. 349‚Äì66); S. Schwartz however, in Imperialism and Jewish society, 200 B.C.E. to 640 C.E. (Princeton 2001), pp. 153‚Äì8, plays down the importance of Beth She'arim. Others came from Antioch (in Turkey), Mesene (in South Mesopotamia), the Phoenician coast, Sidon, Beirut, and Byblos (in Lebanon), and Himyar (in Yemen), among other places. Aside from an extensive body of inscriptions in several languages, the walls and tombs have many images, engraved and carved in relief, ranging from Jewish symbols and geometric decoration to animals and figures from Hellenistic myth and religion.Beth She'arim, UNESCO world heritage site \\"tentative list\\", summary from 2002 Access to many of the catacombs was obtained by passing through stone doors that once turned on their axis. In October 2009, two new caves were opened to the public whose burial vaults date to the first two centuries CE.[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1124426.html Row erupts over discovery of Beit Shearim caves, Haaretz Catacomb no. 20 and no. 14 are regularly open to the public, but most catacombs remain closed to the public, with a few being opened on weekends upon special request and prior appointment. Cave of Yehuda HaNasi (Judah the Prince) Rock-cut graves in Catacomb no. 14, thought to belong to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi The Jerusalem Talmud and Babylonian Talmud cite Beit She'arim as the burial place of Rabbi Judah the Prince (Hebrew: Yehuda HaNasi).Jerusalem Talmud (Kila'yim 9:3; Ketubot 12:3 [65b]); Babylonian Talmud (Ketubot 103b) His funeral is described as follows: \\"Miracles were wrought on that day. It was evening and all the towns gathered to mourn him, and eighteen synagogues praised him and bore him to Bet Shearim, and the daylight remained until everyone reached his home (Ketubot 12, 35a).\\"Bet Shearim archaeology The fact that Rabbi Judah was buried here is believed to be a major reason for the popularity of the necropolis in Late Antiquity. Catacomb no. 14 is likely to have belonged to the family of Rabbi Judah the Prince. A clear inscription stating the name and title of Rabbi Judah the Prince in that catacomb identifies it as his burial site.The Oxford Encyclopedia of Archaeology in the Near East, Vol. 1, pp. 309‚Äì11. For a more cautious view see M. Jacobs, Die Institution des j√ºdischen Patriarchen, eine quellen- und traditionskritische Studie zur Geschichte der Juden in der Sp√§tantike (T√ºbingen 1995), p. 247, n. 59. A Hebrew wall inscription from Catacomb 14 reads \\"Simon [Shimon] my son shall be hakham [president of the Sanhedrin], Gamaliel my son patriarch, Hanania bar Hama shall preside over the great court\\", in reference to Rabbi Judah's sons Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Gamliel, and to his student, Rabbi Hanina bar Hama, a statement that is mentioned in the Talmud Tractate Kesubos as well. Two tombs located next to each other within the same catacomb are identified by bilingual Hebrew and Greek inscriptions as those of \\"R. Gamliel\\" and \\"R. Shimon\\", believed to refer to Judah's sons, the nasi Gamaliel III and the hakham Rabbi Shimon. Himyarite tombs Tomb of Himyarite, in Greek uncials In 1937, Benjamin Mazar revealed at Beit She'arim a system of tombs belonging to the Jews of Himyar (now Yemen) dating back to the 3rd century CE.H. Z. Hirschberg, YisrƒÅ‚Äôƒìl ba-‚ÄòArƒÅb, Tel Aviv 1946, pp. 53‚Äì57, 148, 283‚Äì284 (Hebrew). The strength of ties between Yemenite Jewry and the Land of Israel can be learnt by the system of tombs at Beit She'arim dating back to the 3rd century. It is of great significance that Jews from ·∏§imyar were being brought for interment in what was then considered a prestigious place, near the catacombs of the Sanhedrin. Those who had the financial means brought their dead to be buried in the Land of Israel, as it was considered an outstanding virtue for Jews not to be buried in foreign lands, but rather in the land of their forefathers. It is speculated that the ·∏§imyarites, during their lifetime, were known and respected in the eyes of those who dwelt in the Land of Israel, seeing that one of them, whose name was Mena·∏•em, was coined the epithet qyl ·∏•myr [prince of ·∏§imyar], in the eight-character ·∏§imyari ligature, while in the Greek inscription he was called Menae presbyteros (Mena·∏•em, the community's elder).Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian Studies, 43 (2013): British Museum, London; Article by Yosef Tobi, The Jews of Yemen in light of the excavation of the Jewish synagogue in Qanƒ´‚Äô, p. 351. The name of a woman written in Greek in its genitive form, ŒïŒΩŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ±Œ∂, is also engraved there, meaning either 'virtue', 'blessing', or 'gratis'; however, its precise transcription remains of scholarly dispute.H. Z. Hirschberg, YisrƒÅ‚Äôƒìl ba-‚ÄòArƒÅb, Tel Aviv 1946, pp. 56‚Äì57; p. 33 plate b. Christian Robin rejects the interpretation of the ligature qyl ·∏•myr. He notes that today the inscription Menae presbyteros can no longer be seen. The only secured inscription is √îm√™rit√¥n [the ·∏§imyari]. =Abbasid period=Glassmaking industry In 1956, a bulldozer working at the site unearthed an enormous rectangular slab, 11 √ó 6.5 √ó 1.5 feet, weighing 9 tons. Initially, it was paved over, but it was eventually studied and found to be a gigantic piece of glass. A glassmaking furnace was located here in the 9th century during the Abbasid period, which produced great batches of molten glass that were cooled and later broken into small pieces for crafting glass vessels.Negev and Gibson, 2001, pp. 86‚Äì87. \\"Cave of the Lulavim\\" Poem inside catacomb An elegy written in Arabic script typical of the 9‚Äì10th century and containing the date AH 287 or 289 (AD 900 or 902) was found in the Magharat al-Jahannam (\\"Cave of Hell\\") catacomb during excavations conducted there in 1956. The sophisticated and beautifully worded elegy was composed by the previously unknown poet Umm al-Qasim, whose name is given in acrostic in the poem, and it can be read in Moshe Sharon's book or here on wikipedia.Sharon, 2004, p. xli Moshe Sharon speculates that this poem might be marking the beginning of the practice of treating this site as the sanctuary of Sheikh Abreik and suggests the site was used for burial at this time and possibly later as well.Sharon, 2004, p.xlii He further notes that the cave within which the inscription was found forms part of a vast area of ancient ruins which constituted a natural place for the emergence of a local shrine. Drawing on the work of Tawfiq Canaan, Sharon cites his observation that 32% of the sacred sites he visited in Palestine were located in the vicinity of ancient ruins. =Excavations continued= One of the broken stone doors at entrance to one of the caves The excavations at the site were resumed by Adi Erlich, on behalf of the Zinman Institute of Archaeology, the University of Haifa.

Her musical work centres on her career as a vocalist, predominantly with the bands of her husband, British composer and bandleader Mike Westbrook. She also works extensively as librettist and doubles as instrumentalist (tenor horn and piccolo). Biography Kate Westbrook was born in Guildford, Surrey, England, and grew up in the U.S. and Canada before going to Dartington Hall School (which later became Dartington College of Arts) in Devon. From there she went to Bath Academy of Art at Corsham and then to Reading University. Later she lived and worked on the East and West coasts of America. After travelling in Mexico she returned to England and took up a part-time teaching post at Leeds College of Art. Westbrook's musical career began in 1974 when she joined the Mike Westbrook Brass Band and gave up teaching to concentrate on the dual career of painter and musician. She has worked in theatre, radio, and TV. =Music= As an instrumentalist she plays tenor horn and piccolo, however her work centres on vocals both as singer and librettist. Kate Westbrook's wide vocal range embraces jazz, music theatre (she sang the role of Anna in Bertolt Brecht's The Seven Deadly Sins with the London Symphony Orchestra), contemporary music (pieces by Frederic Rzewski, Philip Clark), opera (Gioacchino Rossini) and music hall. She has performed all over Europe and as far afield as the far East and North America. Her work as lyricist has encompassed everything from cabaret songs to opera. In collaboration with her husband, Mike Westbrook, she has generated a whole series of jazz/cabarets and music-theatre pieces. She adapts and sings texts in several languages (English, German, French, Italian on a regular basis - several others when the occasion arises). Other than her own lyrics and music, her repertoire includes works by William Blake, Bertolt Brecht/Kurt Weill, Cole Porter, Friedrich Hollaender, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Paul √âluard, Edward Lear, Wilhelm Busch, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and The Beatles.

Every Child Matters covers children and young adults up to the age of 19, or 24 for those with disabilities. Tanzanian school children * stay safe * be healthy * enjoy and achieve * make a positive contribution * achieve economic well-being Each of these themes has a detailed framework attached which is required for multi-agency partnerships to work together in order to achieve. The agencies in partnership may include children's centres, early years, schools, children's social work services, primary and secondary health services, playwork, and Child and Adolescent Mental Health services (CAMHS). In the past it has been argued that children and families have received poorer services because of the failure of professionals to understand each other's roles or to work together effectively in a multi-disciplinary manner. ECM seeks to change this, stressing that it is important that all professionals working with children are aware of the contribution that could be made by their own and each other's service and to plan and deliver their work with children and young people accordingly.Barker, Richard (ed) (2009) \\"Making Sense of Every Child Matters -- Multi-professional practice guidance\\" Policy Press A helpful acronym to remember the five parts is SHEEP - Every child shall be: Safe, Healthy, Enjoy/Achieve, Economic, Positive contribution. It is the central goal of Every Child Matters to ensure every pupil is given the chance to be able to work towards the goals referenced within it.

The drive is held each year in Britain during the second week of May, when thousands of volunteers post red collection envelopes to households around the country. Held each year since 1957 the event celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2007, making it Britain‚Äôs longest running fundraising week. Christian Aid works with 700 local organisations across 50 developing countries. Working with poor communities, it trains people to deal with the effects of climate change and prepares them for the threat of natural disasters. These local organisations - or ‚Äòpartners‚Äô ‚Äì also work on HIV, training and education, health and sanitation and peace and reconciliation. In 2007 the organisation encouraged people to plant trees in support of its overseas work on climate change projects. The charity aimed to raise ¬£15.5 million from the annual fundraising week in 2007, and approximately 300,000 volunteers across the United Kingdom posted the well known red envelopes through millions of letterboxes. In 2013, ¬£12.6 million (or 13% percent of the total income) were raised during this week. History In 1945 the British and Irish churches established the Christian Reconstruction in Europe. Its purpose was to raise funds for the resettlement of some of the millions of people left homeless by World War II. In 1948, it was renamed the Inter-Church Aid and Refugee Service, and became part of the British Council of Churches. During the next decade, the organisation began to move into worldwide development work. The overriding theme was the promotion of self-reliance. In 1957, Janet Lacey, the organisation‚Äôs then director, decided to hold a ‚ÄúChristian Aid Week‚Äù to encourage public awareness. This first event mobilised residents in 200 towns and villages across Britain, collecting ¬£26,000 for overseas development work. In 1964 the agency changed its name to Christian Aid. During the 1960s, the threat of hunger, even famine, made agricultural development a priority in the poorest regions of the world, especially Africa and Asia. As well as overseas aid, Christian Aid began to tell Church supporters and schools about the causes of poverty and helped establish the World Development Movement. =2020= Early in 2020 Christian Aid promoted two major features for Christian Aid Week in May that year - encourage supporters to hold a 'Big Brekkie' fry-up meal in their homes, churches or other social settings, and the innovation of delivery-only envelopes that could be brought to homes but did not require personal collection by local collectors and would be posted to Christian Aid or handed in at pre-arranged points instead.Christian Aid centrefold advertisement in Idea, the Magazine of the Evangelical Alliance, March/April 2020, pages 16-17. However the emergence of the Coronavirus Pandemic in the UK in March and the consequent lockdown led to advice in April from the chief executive Amanda Kwaze Mukwashi to not proceed with door-to-door envelope distribution and collection and associated face-to-face fund raising activities, instead encouraging online donations from the public. Projects flagged up for particular support included provision of counter-measures to the disease in refugee camps.https://www.christianaid.org.uk/about-us/christian-aid-week/coronavirus- guidance ReferencesExternal links *Christian Aid web site *Christian Aid Week Campaign web site Category:International development ","title":"Christian Aid Week"},{"id":"10368438","text":"Beit She'arim (), also (),In the Jerusalem Talmud (Kila'im 9:3; Ketubbot 12:3 [65b]; Eruvin 1:1 [3a]), the town's name is written in an elided-consonant form, (), which follows more closely the Greek transliteration in Josephus' Vita ¬ß 24, (). Kh. Sheikh Abrei·∏≥ (), is a Roman-era Jewish village (now ruin) that thrived from the 1st-century BCE until its demise in the early 20th century.A population list from about 1887 showed that Sheikh Abreik had about 395 inhabitants; all Muslims. See: Schumacher (1888), p. 175 The name of site is occasionally rendered as Bet She'arƒÅyim (Hebrew: ◊ë÷º◊ô◊™ ◊©◊¢◊®÷∑◊ô÷¥◊ù, \\"House of Two Gates\\"). It is first mentioned by Josephus as Besara (), a place then serving as the administrative center of the estates of Queen Berenice (daughter of Agrippa I) in the Jezreel Valley. The village seemed to have been of agricultural importance, as it was being used to store the harvested grain of the neighboring towns and villages.Josephus, Vita ¬ß 24Beit She'arim, the Jewish Necropolis of the Roman Period By the mid-2nd century, the village had become the seat of the rabbinic synod under Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi.Avigad, N. & Schwabe, M. (1954), p. 1; cf. Babylonian Talmud, Rosh Hashana 31b, Rashi s.v. ◊ï◊û◊ô◊ë◊†◊ê ◊ú◊ê◊ï◊©◊ê; Babylonian Talmud (Sanhedrin 32b). The site is situated on the spur of a hill about half a kilometer long and 200 meters wide, and lies in the southern extremity of the Lower Galilee mountains, facing the western end of the Jezreel Valley, east of Daliat el-Carmel, south of Kiryat Tivon, and west of Ramat Yishai. It rises above sea level at its highest point. Adjoining the village on its northwest side is a necropolis, situated in a valley, which rose to prominence largely due to Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi (compiler of the Mishnah) who was interred there.Jerusalem Talmud (Ketubbot 12:3 [65b]); Babylonian Talmud (Ketubbot 103b‚Äì104a) In the 3rd and 4th centuries CE, Beit Shearim became a popular place for Diaspora Jews to send their dead for burial.Ilan, Zvi (1991), p. 198Freedman, D.N. (1992), p. 793Jerusalem Talmud (Mo'ed Katan 3:5 [14b]). There, when speaking about the rules of mourning, the question was asked: When does mourning actually begin for those who carry their deceased from place to place, such as those who are brought for burial at Beit Shearim? In 2015, the necropolis, known as the Beit She'arim National Park, was recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage site.  Identification  For many years the ancient site of Beit Shearim remained obscure and nearly slipped into oblivion. Throughout the centuries, the village's Hebrew name was changed to Sheikh Abreik (Sheikh Bureik). Some historical geographers thought that Sheikh Abrei·∏≥ was to be identified with Gaba Hippeum (Geba), the site mentioned by Josephus as being in the confines of Mount Carmel.An opinion held by Victor Gu√©rin; see: Gu√©rin, V. (1880), pp. 395‚Äì397; Conder & Kitchener (1881), p. 351 It was not until Alexander Za√Ød in 1936 discovered a \\"new\\" catacomb among the known burial caves in the hill directly below Sheikh Abrei·∏≥ and brought it to the attention of British Mandate archaeologist Benjamin Mazar and Yitzhak Ben-Zvi that priority was given to the site, which discovery prompted seven seasons of systematic excavations at Sheikh Abrei·∏≥ and its necropolis between the years 1936‚Äì1940, and 1956, under the direction of Prof. Benjamin Mazar on behalf of the Jewish Palestine Exploration Society, and again in the years 1953‚Äì1958 under Nahman Avigad.Avigad, N. (n.d.), p. 1 Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, looking at the evidence presented to him by Mazar, reached the conclusion that this was no ordinary find, but that it most certainly was the burial grounds of the Jewish Patriarchal family of the 2nd-century CE. Although historical geographer Samuel Klein had argued as early as 1913 that Beth-Shearim and Besara were to be recognised as one and the same place, an opinion followed by C.R. Conder,Conder, C.R. (1879), p. 181 he was unable to pin-point its exact location. Only after the revelations of 1936 came to light, and Ben-Zvi's recognition that the necropolis at Sheikh Abreik belonged to a Patriarchal family, did Klein reach the conclusion that Sheikh Abreik was the ancient site of Beit Shearim.Mazar, B. (Maisler) (1957), p. 19 Klein's identification was later corroborated by the discovery of a broken marble slab, from a mausoleum above Catacomb no. 11, containing a Greek inscription, in which the funerary epigram (written during the deceased person's lifetime) bears the words: \\"I, Justus, the son of [S]appho, of the family Leontius, have died and have been laid to rest...alas, [here] in [B]esar[a]\\" (Besara being the Aramaic dialect spoken in Galilee for Beit Shearim).Mazar, B. (Maisler) (1957), p. vii; Schwabe, Moshe (1940), pp. 5‚Äì7; Summary (reprinted from the Bulletin of the Jewish Palestine Exploration Society, vi‚Äìvii, 1939). The Greek epigram is, today, at the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem. Menorah and Sargophagus found at the Beit Shearim necropolis Fa√ßade of burial cave at Beit Shearim necropolis (reconstructed) Additional excavations were conducted at the site in 2006‚Äì2007 by archaeologist Yotam Tepper on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority, during which season coins from the Roman and Byzantine periods were retrieved.Hadashot Arkheologiyot: Excavations and Surveys in Israel, Israel Antiquities Authority ()  Site description  The village site retains the stone foundation of what appears to be a large synagogue (35 √ó 15 m) and other public buildings in the northeastern quarter of the ruins.Mazar, B. (Maisler), (1957), p. 20 A hall directly in front of the synagogue entrance was aligned with two rows of columns, each row containing eight pillars. One large structure (40 √ó 15 m) on the southwestern part of the hill is thought to have been a basilica which, under the Jewish custom of the time, buildings of such size were used primarily for kings holding court, or for baths, or for royal treasuries.Cf. Babylonian Talmud (Avodah Zarah 16b) It was constructed of large, smooth-bossed ashlars that were coated with thick plaster. The basilica contained two rows of seven square pillars. Archaeologists have also identified a late Roman \\"stepped pool\\" in Beit Shearim, and three 3rd to 4th-century ritual baths (mikveh) on the ancient site.Miller, Stuart S. (2015), pp. 23, 207 Ancient stone-pavements, cisterns, and walls of hewn-stone can still be seen on the site. Byzantine mosaics have also been found at the site.Vitto, Fanny (1996) Remains of a gate and an oil press from the Byzantine period were discovered at the northern edge of the summit, but are thought to have been built in an earlier time. =Necropolis= Based on the inscriptions found at the necropolis, Jews were being brought for burial at Beit Shearim from all neighboring places, such as from the Phoenician coast, Sidon, Beirut, and Byblos (in Lebanon), Palmyra (in Syria), Antioch (in Turkey), Mesene (in South Mesopotamia), and Himyar (in Yemen), among other places. The people of Himyar were buried in a single catacomb, in which 40 smaller rooms or loculi branched-off from a main hall.Tobi, Y. & Seri, S. (2000), p. 37 The burial cave dates from the beginning of the 3rd-century CE. Twenty-one catacombs have thus far been discovered at the necropolis. When the catacombs were first explored by archaeologists in the 20th-century, the tombs had already fallen into great disrepair and neglect, and the sarcophagi contained therein had almost all been broken-into by grave-robbers in search for treasure. This pillaging was believed to have happened in the 8th and 9th centuries CE based on the type of terra-cotta lamps found in situ.Avigad, N. (1958), p. 36 The robbers also emptied the stone coffins of the bones of the deceased. During the Mameluk period (13th-15th centuries), the \\"Cave of the Coffins\\" (Catacomb no. 20) served as a place of refuge for Arab shepherds.Avigad, N. (1958), p. 37 Lieutenant C. R. Conder of the Palestine Exploration Fund visited the site in late 1872 and described one of the systems of caves, known as \\"The Cave of Hell\\" (M≈≠gh√¢ret el-Jehennum).Conder & Kitchener (1881), pp. 325 - ff. While exploring a catacomb, he found there a coin of Agrippa, which find led him to conclude that the ruins date back to \\"the later Jewish times, about the Christian era.\\"Conder & Kitchener (1881), p. 351 Benjamin Mazar, during his excavations of Sheikh Abreik, discovered coins that date no later than the time of Constantine the Great and Constantius II.Mazar, B. (1957), p. vi (Introduction) In wake of the excavations conducted under Nahman Avigad, Avigad remarked: \\"The fact that in one catacomb nearly one hundred and thirty sarcophagi were discovered, and that there had previously been many more, makes it one of the foremost catacombs of ancient times in so far as the use of sarcophagi is concerned.\\"Avigad, N. (1958), p. 29 Conservation work in the catacombs at Beit Shearim has being carried out over the years, in order to check the decay and to preserve old structures.  Early history  Pottery shards discovered at the site indicate that a first settlement there dates back to the Iron Age.Negev, Avraham & Gibson, S. (2001), pp. 86‚Äì87 An anecdote about communal life in Beit Shearim has come down in the name of Judah ha- Nasi, who, after mentioning the place, alludes to the practice of its people being observant in the laws of Jewish ritual purity.According to Rashi, people descended from Aaron's lineage and living in Beit Shearim consumed of the priestly bread (Terumah) in a state of ritual purity (meaning, they made use of the ashes of the Red Heifer and immersed in a ritual bath, as required for ritual purity before consuming of the Terumah). See: Babylonian Talmud, Niddah 32a, Rashi s.v. ◊ß◊ï◊ì◊ù ◊ú◊ê◊û◊î. The Mishnaic sage, Rabbi Johanan ben Nuri, made his home in Beit Shearim.Tosefta, Sukkah 2:2 During its Jewish settlement in the Second Temple period, the inhabitants of Beit Shearim are believed to have been occupied in husbandry, but when the village land became a popular burial ground for Diaspora Jews, many of the villagers are thought to have worked in funeral preparations (obsequies) and in stone-masonry. Some have speculated that Beit Shearim may have been destroyed in the general revolt under Gallus Caesar in 351/2 CE, during a time when many towns and villages in Galilee and Judea were assigned to the flames, including Sepphoris.Avigad, N. (n.d.), p. 2Mazar, B. (1957), p. 18 During this time, the necropolis fell into disuse. In any rate, the site shows signs of resettlement in the Byzantine period, all throughout the 6th-century, and into the early Arab period, although dwindling in importance.Leibner, Uzi (2009), p. 384 Panoramic view of region looking down from Beit She'arim See also *Ancient synagogues in the Palestine region **Ancient synagogues in Israel *Archaeology of Israel * Vigna Randanini - Jewish catacombs in Rome, 2nd-5th century Further reading * *Mazar, Benjamin (1973).

He was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1884 to 1892, taking his seat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. He was the son of Justin McCarthy (1830‚Äì1912). Since both father and son were authors, historians, and Members of Parliament, they are sometimes confused in lists and compilations. Political career McCarthy was first elected to Parliament at a by-election on 12 June 1884, when he was returned unopposed as the Home Rule League member for Athlone, following the death of the Liberal MP Sir John James Ennis. Athlone lost its status as a parliamentary borough under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, and at the 1885 general election McCarthy stood instead in the borough of Newry in County Down, where he was returned unopposed for the Irish Parliamentary Party.Walker, op. cit., p. 134. He was re-elected in 1886, with a comfortable majority over the Liberal Unionist Reginald Saunders,Walker, op. cit., p. 140. but did not contest the 1892 election. Writing McCarthy wrote various novels, plays, poetical pieces and short histories. He was briefly married to the actress Cissie Loftus. They married in Edinburgh in 1894, and though they divorced in 1899, she originated the role of Katherine de Vaucelles, the heroine in If I Were King in 1901.Burns Mantle and Garrison P.

Boldt was born in the town of Christfelde an der Weichsel in the countryside of West Prussia, an area which is now a part of Poland. After finishing his secondary education, he studied philology at universities in Munich, Marburg, and Berlin without taking a degree. Once in Berlin, he started associating with the writers and artists who frequented the city's many cafes and began writing poetry himself. In 1912, his first published poems appeared in Die Aktion, a magazine most frequently associated with the Expressionist movement. Two years later, he published his only book, Junge Pferde! Junge Pferde! (Young Horses! Young Horses). He was drafted into the German Army at the beginning of World War I, but was discharged in 1916 regarded psychologically unfit to serve. It was during his time in the military that he stopped writing poetry, and the last of his poems to appear in print during his lifetime came out in 1918. Boldt died at the age of 35 from an embolism that was a complication of surgery for a hernia. Since his death, he has been largely forgotten, unlike other Expressionist poets writing in German, such as Gottfried Benn, Georg Heym, and Georg Trakl. (There are, in fact, no photographs or likenesses of Boldt known to exist.) However, in the last few decades there has been a movement seeking to revive recognition for what many readers and critics believe to be his considerable poetic gifts. Most recently, there has been a \\"mini-renaissance\\" of Boldt's reputation in the German-speaking world, as his complete works have been republished for the first time in over a quarter-century; specifically in two volumes: Junge Pferde! Junge Pferde! (\\"Young Horses! Young Horses!\\") and \\"Auf der Terrasse des Cafe Josty\\" (\\"On the Terrace of Cafe Josty\\"), published by Edition Razamba in 2008 and 2009, respectively.

It was renamed as the 3rd Regiment of Dragoon Guards in 1751 and the 3rd (Prince of Wales's) Dragoon Guards in 1765. It saw service for two centuries, including the First World War, before being amalgamated into the 3rd/6th Dragoon Guards in 1922. History The 3rd Dragoon Guards violently suppressing the Bristol Riots of 1831 The regiment was first raised by Thomas Hickman-Windsor, 1st Earl of Plymouth as the Earl of Plymouth's Regiment of Horse in 1685 as part of the response to the Monmouth Rebellion, by the regimenting of various independent troops, and was ranked as the 4th Regiment of Horse.

It is located on the University's Charles River Campus in Boston, Massachusetts in the former Lahey Clinic building. BU Wheelock has more than 31,000 alumni, 65 full-time faculty and both undergraduate and graduate students.School of Education  Schools & Colleges  Academics  Boston University Boston University School of Education was ranked 34th in the nation in 2018 by U.S. News & World Report in their rankings of graduate schools of education.US News and World Report Education Graduate Schools 2016 The School of Education is a member institution of the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE). History Boston University School of Education was founded in 1918. Dr. Arthur H. Wilde, the first dean of the School, wrote, \\"Our policy has been to keep in as vital touch with the everyday work of the schools as we could‚Äîto know the needs of the teachers and of the school officers and to give immediate satisfaction to those needs, yet with a view to the broader education of these teachers and officers.\\" http://www.bu.edu/sed/city.htm SED houses the oldest continuously published journal in the field of education in the country, the Journal of Education, founded in 1875 from the merger of five New England education journals. In 1953 the Boston University School of Education took over publication of the journal,; see in particular p. 56 converting it to a student-run review in 1972 and to a peer-reviewed academic journal in 2009. Programs of study Boston University School of Education offers a Bachelor of Science undergraduate degree in ten programs and graduate degrees in more than twenty areas through the Master of Education degree, the Master of Arts in Teaching degree, the Certificate of Advanced Graduate Study, and the Doctor of Education degree. Although programs are grouped within academic departments that reflect the chief teaching and research interests of the faculty, course work and projects often extend across departmental lines into other areas of the School and University. Programs in the Department of Educational Leadership prepare students for a variety of responsibilities in administration, training, and policy-centered development work. Graduates can be found in elementary, secondary, and postsecondary school administration, student and alumni affairs, corporate training and development, international educational development, and directing international schools. Programs in the Department of Curriculum and Teaching prepare professionals for teaching and other leadership responsibilities in education. Students prepare for educational work in schools, media centers, school libraries, community agencies, and educational research projects, as well as state and national educational organizations. Most programs include courses leading to classroom teaching certification. Boston University's special education program offers a dual-degree program with the School of Social Work that enables qualified students to earn either the M.S.W./Ed.M. or the M.S.W./Ed.D. Within these two departments, offerings include programs in school and community counseling, sport psychology, and human development and education that prepare students for practice informed by the latest theories in life-span development. The literacy and reading education programs, based on the most recent research in the field, prepare students to be reading specialists, provide educational interventions in literacy, and contribute new knowledge to the field through doctoral study. Leading-edge areas of study in language education include education of the deaf (bilingual/bicultural focus), teaching English to speakers of other languages (K‚Äì12 ESL and adult TESOL), and modern foreign language education. Master's degree and C.A.G.S. programs usually require the equivalent of one year of full-time study. Doctoral programs generally require the equivalent of two or more years of full-time study.http://www.petersons.com/GradChannel/code/ProgramVC.asp?sn=Boston- UniversityŒº=School-of-Education&inunid;=37521&sponsor;=1&related;=true Research facilities The Pickering Educational Resources Library (PERL) houses materials on curriculum and instruction, including textbooks, tests, and a special K‚Äì12 collection. Students in the School have access to all libraries within the University system (including an extensive collection of electronic indexes and journals), as well as the Boston Library Consortium. The University collection is the second largest in New England (behind Harvard) and contains about 2.1 million volumes, with the equivalent of an additional 3.9 million volumes stored on microform, and a growing collection of Web-based resources. University media services include video services and photographic facilities. The School's Instructional Materials Center (IMC) supports a wide range of instructional and communications aids: computing and printing resources, telecommunications, photography, audio-visual materials, video technology, and overhead transparencies and graphics. School-based clinics and learning laboratories offer opportunities for research and firsthand learning experiences. The Early Childhood Learning Laboratory (ECLL) is a preschool affiliated with and located at the School of Education. It is a laboratory and demonstration school available to Boston University students, parents of children in the program, and other early childhood professionals for observing children and teachers. Children whose families live in the local neighborhood primarily attend this open-enrollment school. There are 20 children, ages 2.9-5, in a mixed age group with two licensed early childhood teachers. The preschool program employs an innovative, inquiry-based approach to curriculum design. Teachers determine a topic of study that relates to the children's interest. The concepts or big ideas of this topic are decided upon, and activities are designed to teach those concepts. Teachers continually monitor the children's engagement in the activities, documenting their comments, questions, and interactions in order to make on-going adjustments to the plan and the environment. The Instructional Materials Center (IMC) is a multimedia technology resource center that supports a wide range of instructional and communication aids, including extensive computing and printing resources, multimedia classrooms, telecommunications, photography, audio-visual materials, and video technologyhttp://sedtech.bu.edu/ Other programs *The Boston University/Boston Public Schools Collaborative is the administrative organization at the University that oversees more than a dozen programs created in support of the Boston Public Schools. In 1975, court- ordered school desegregation in Boston stimulated an unprecedented commitment by Boston-area colleges, universities, and businesses to help the city's schools and children. Boston University has been and continues to be an active participant. University resources contribute to the support of a full-time director who initiates and seeks funding for new programs which involve faculty and students in serving the needs of Boston school children. *The Consortium was established in 1977 when the Boston University School of Education and a selection of Boston-area school districts, social service agencies, and overseas universities came together to form a consortium for the mutual exchange of expertise and training. Since that time, consortium school systems and social service agencies have offered SED students with a variety of settings in which to student-teach, gain school-based counseling experience, and work as administrative interns. *The Boston University/Chelsea Partnership was the only example of a private university accepting responsibility for the day-to-day management of a public school system. Boston University provided managerial and educational expertise to oversee and rebuild an entire urban school system and to construct a model for the reform of urban education. This partnership was ended in June 2008. *Step UP is an unprecedented collaboration with the Boston Public Schools (BPS) and the City of Boston to help local schools. Boston University is one of five universities involved in the program. Step UP was formed in the fall of 2006 and provides comprehensive, coordinated services aimed at improving student performance. Boston University's two partner schools are the William Monroe Trotter Elementary School in Dorchester and the English High School in Jamaica Plain. Based on the needs identified by each partner school, BU aims to help the Trotter and the English make improvements in areas such as instruction and tutoring, after-school support, student wellness and safety, and family and community engagement. *Upward Bound is a college preparatory program for potential first-generation college and low-income Boston Public High School students. It is a federally funded TRIO program that serves 75 low-income and first generation college students who join in either ninth and tenth grade and participate until high school graduation. Students must be enrolled in the Boston Public Schools and either attend one of the target high schools (Brighton High, English High, The Engineering School, Community Academy of Science and Health, Social Justice Academy, or Snowden High) or live in one of the target neighborhoods (Allston, Brighton, Dorchester, Jamaica Plain, Roxbury, or Mattapan). Program Services include afternoon classes and tutoring during the school year and a residential six-week summer academic program. *Jumpstart is an AmeriCorps program that recruits college students to mentor 3- to 5-year-old children. Students read stories, sing songs, and play games that support young children's school readiness and earn a Work-Study wage, a $1,500 living allowance, an AmeriCorps education award of up to $1,000, and take course credit in ED 206. Jumpstart Corps members work 8‚Äì12 hours a week in local early childhood centers, paired one-to-one with a partner child. *The Boston University Conference on Language Development, regarded as the leading international conference in the field, takes place on campus every fall, with the active involvement of faculty and students from the School of Education. Two centers are also affiliated with the School: the Center for the Advancement of Ethics and Character and the Center for Communication and Deafness. *The Institute for Athletic Coach Education (IACE) in the School of Education at Boston University is designed to focus attention on the need for education and training for youth sport coaches. At the Institute, youth sports are considered a vehicle for helping young people develop into productive members of society, with the guidance of a significant adult mentor who is most often a coach. We aim to provide present and future youth sport coaches with learning opportunities and resources to help them better understand their role and fulfill their responsibilities as leaders and educators in the community. *COACH (College Opportunity and Career Help) empowers Boston Public School students to make informed decisions about their futures by matching current college students with 11th and 12th graders to provide information, to motivate, and to support these students as they make post-secondary plans. Working directly in the high school classrooms, coaches gain a unique perspective on issues of college access, public education, and educational opportunity. By linking practice with ongoing research and dialogue, COACH continually looks for ways to challenge, explore, and bridge the growing opportunity gap for traditionally underrepresented students. *The Center for the Study of Communication and the Deaf is devoted to both applied and theoretical research to benefit the Deaf and their families. Faculty and students have focused on three major research themes: the acquisition of sign languages, the impact of language on the education of the Deaf child, and the developmental assessment of bilingual approaches to the education of Deaf children. A variety of community services focus on projects assisting the hearing parents of Deaf children and on workshops and presentations to area agencies. The center has recently begun to create assessment instruments to determine ASL development in Deaf children. *The Center for Character and Social Responsibility at Boston University addresses a range of issues related to young people acquiring sound ethical values and framing good character. Assists educators in becoming more competent and confident in the teaching and study of ethics and character. The center also fosters more research initiatives in and publications on moral and character education. *sedGreen committee is an expanding group of faculty, students, and staff who work to advocate for green practices and policies. Initiated in November 2006, sedGreen meets monthly to discuss environmental goals in the School of Education, as well as all of Boston University. *Projects in Civic Engagement share a common aim‚Äîto promote civic engagement in democratic life, both within the United States and in emerging democracies abroad. Genuine civic engagement requires deep knowledge of democratic principles as well as practical experience in influencing public policy, and these projects take as their goals the development of knowledge and skills necessary for effective and meaningful civic engagement. *The Donald Durrell Reading & Writing Clinic at Boston University serves elementary and middle school students who experience difficulty with reading and writing. Students who enroll in the program have a range of learning profiles: some struggle just a bit, while others experience severe reading and writing difficulty. *The Summer Literacy Institute is a one-week institute offered each summer by the School of Education that addresses current issues in literacy learning. The institute is intended for classroom teachers, literacy specialists, and administrators who would like to deepen or update their knowledge of effective assessment and instruction in literacy. *The Intergenerational Literacy Program began offering literacy instruction to parents in 1989. The program was developed in collaboration with 17 community organizations and is guided by an Advisory Board representing participating parents, the Chelsea Public Schools, Boston University and community organizations. *Gardner Pilot Academy Physical Education Collaboration is a program that, for the past three decades, has bussed children from the Gardner and Hamilton Schools to Boston University's Case Center for Physical Education classes taught by BU graduate students.

Until Australia became a Federation in 1901, each of the six colonies were responsible for their own defence. From 1788 until 1870 this was done with British regular forces. In all, 24 British infantry regiments served in the Australian colonies. Each of the Australian colonies gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890, and while the Colonial Office in London retained control of some affairs, and the colonies were still firmly within the British Empire, the Governors of the Australian colonies were required to raise their own colonial militia. To do this, the colonial Governors had the authority from the British crown to raise military and naval forces. Initially these were militias in support of British regulars, but British military support for the colonies ended in 1870, and the colonies assumed their own defence. The separate colonies maintained control over their respective militia forces and navies until 1 March 1901, when the colonial forces were all amalgamated into the Commonwealth Forces following the creation of the Commonwealth of Australia. Colonial forces, including home raised units, saw action in many of the conflicts of the British Empire during the 19th century. Members from British regiments stationed in Australia saw action in India, Afghanistan, the New Zealand Wars, the Sudan conflict, and the Boer War in South Africa. Despite an undeserved reputation of colonial inferiority, many of the locally raised units were highly organised, disciplined, professional, and well trained. For most of the time from settlement until Federation, military defences in Australia revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery, based on garrisoned coastal forts; however, in the 1890s improved railway communications between all of the eastern mainland colonies (Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia), led Major General Bevan Edwards, who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces, to state his belief that the colonies could be defended by the rapid mobilisation of standard brigades. He called for a restructure of colonial defences, and defensive agreements to be made between the colonies. He also called for professional units to replace all of the volunteer forces. By 1901, the Australian colonies were federated and formally joined together to become the Commonwealth of Australia, and the federal government assumed all defensive responsibilities. The Federation of Australia came into existence on 1 January 1901 and as of that time the constitution of Australia stated that all defence responsibility was vested in the Commonwealth government. Co-ordination of Australia-wide defensive efforts in the face of imperial German interest in the Pacific Ocean was one of the main reasons for federation, and so one of the first decisions made by the newly formed Commonwealth government was to create the Department of Defence which came into being on 1 March 1901. From that time the Australian Army came into being under the command of Major General Sir Edward Hutton, and all of the colonial forces, including those then on active service in South Africa, transferred into the Australian Army. Background A General Chart of New Holland including New South Wales & Botany Bay with The Adjacent Countries and New Discovered Lands, published in An Historical Narrative of the Discovery of New Holland and New South Wales. (London, Fielding and Stockdale, November 1786). Australia was first formally claimed by Great Britain on 22 August 1770 by James Cook RN, however it was not settled until 26 January 1788 with the arrival of the First Fleet.. Frustrated in 1783 by the loss of their American colonies on the signing of the Treaty of Paris which formally ended the American Revolutionary War, the British sought a new destination for the transportation of convicts.. The fleet, consisting of 11 ships,. had arrived in Australia with just over 1100, of which around 750 convicts under the guard of marines, to establish a colony with convict labour at Port Jackson. Initially the colony was run as an open prison under the governance of Royal Navy Captain Arthur Phillip.. Later, as more free settlers were attracted to Australia and transportation was ceased in the mid-1800s, the nature of the colonies changed as Australia began to emerge as a modern, self-sustaining society and after the 1850s the colonies were progressively granted responsible government, allowing them to manage most of their own affairs while remaining part of the British Empire.. Nevertheless, the Colonial Office in London retained control of some matters, including foreign affairs and defence.. As a result, until the 1870s when the last imperial troops were withdrawn, British regular troops constantly garrisoned the colonies. During their postings to Australia, most of the regiments rotated duties in the various colonies, and often had detachments located in geographically diverse locations at the same time... British garrison Accompanying the First Fleet to Port Jackson were three companies of marines totalling 212 men under the command of Major Robert Ross, to guard the fledgling colony of Sydney and that of Norfolk Island, which had been established on 6 March 1788 to provide a food base and investigate supply of masts and flax for canvas for the Royal Navy. In 1790 the Second Fleet arrived, and the marines were relieved by a new force which was created specifically for service in the colony of New South Wales.. With an average strength of 550 men,. it was known as the New South Wales Corps. The first contingent of 183 men, under Major Francis Grose, arrived in New South Wales in June 1790. They were subsequently expanded with further contingents from Britain as well as free settlers, former convicts and marines who had discharged in the colony.. Throughout the mid-1790s the New South Wales Corps was involved in \\"open war\\" along the Hawkesbury River against the Daruk people. Between 1786 and 1792 an ad hoc volunteer unit known as the New South Wales Marine Corps from the British Royal Navy was created to guard the convicts aboard the First Fleet to Australia and to preserve \\"subordination and regularity\\" in the penal colony in New South Wales.Correspondence from Lord Sydney to the Lords Commissioners of Treasury, 18 August 1786. Cited in . A cartoon some years later of the Battle of Vinegar Hill, artist unknown, from the Australian National Library On 4 March 1804, the New South Wales Corps was called into action to put down the Castle Hill convict rebellion. Also known as the \\"Irish Rebellion\\" and sometimes the second \\"Battle of Vinegar Hill\\" in reference to the uprising which took place in Ireland during the Irish Rebellion of 1798, it was a rebellion against British colonial authority that occurred when Irish convicts,. led by Phillip Cunningham and William Johnson,. along with many hundreds took up arms at Castle Hill and marched towards Parramatta, expecting support from the 1100 convicts from the river flat settlement at Green Hills, today's Hawkesbury.. In response, martial law was declared and a detachment of 56 men from the New South Wales Corps under the command of Major George Johnston,. marched all night to Parramatta and then pursued the rebels to near the modern Sydney suburb of Rouse Hill, where they engaged with the main rebel force consisting of about 230 to 260 men. A firefight followed between well trained and armed soldiers and the convicts after which the rebels dispersed. By the time that the fugitives had been chased down over the following days, at least 15 rebels had been killed and six were wounded, while another 26 had been captured, according to official records. Nine rebels were subsequently hanged.. Following the events of the Rum Rebellion, the New South Wales Corps was disbanded, reformed as the 102nd Regiment, and returned to England. At the same time, the various loyal associations were also disbanded. To replace the New South Wales Corps, in 1810 the 73rd Regiment of Foot (MacLeod's Highlanders) arrived in the colony, becoming the first line regiment to serve in New South Wales under the Governorship of Lachlan Macquarie.. The Highlanders were replaced by the 1st/46th (South Devonshire) Regiment of Foot, known as the \\"Red Feathers\\", who would serve in Australia until 1818.. In March 1810, the New South Wales Invalid Company was formed for veteran British soldiers and marines who were too old \\"to serve to the best of their capacity\\", and served mainly as post guards, for the supervision of convicts and other government duties. It was composed of veterans of the 102nd, and other units from veteran soldiers.. By 1817 Lachlan Macquarie felt they were unable to perform even these duties, and recommended their disbandment. This was eventually done on 24 September 1822. However, three further veterans companies were raised in 1825 to \\"relieve the garrison of police work\\". for service in New South Wales, and stayed on duties until 1833. From 1810 until the withdrawal of British forces from Australia in 1870, about 20,000 British soldiers,. serving in 24 British infantry regiments undertook garrison duties in Australia on a rotational basis, along with elements of the marines, Royal Engineers and Royal Artillery. Many of these units were veterans of famous battles of the Napoleonic Wars, and ultimately 13 \\"Peninsula regiments\\" served in the colonies.. While deployed, British Army regiments undertook a variety of duties. This included guarding convict settlements,. hunting down bushrangers,. suppressing armed resistance by Indigenous Australians,. providing security on the goldfields,. assisting local police to maintain public order,. undertaking ceremonial duties and developing the infrastructure of the nation's military defences.. A memorial erected by the 99th Regiment of Foot at Anglesea Barracks, Hobart to commemorate the soldiers of the regiment killed during the New Zealand Wars. This was the first war memorial built in Australia,. and is the only monument built by British soldiers in Australia to commemorate their casualties. Initially these forces were based solely in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land (later known as Tasmania),. however, later they were sent to Western Australia, South Australia,. the Port Phillip District (later known as Victoria),. Queensland and the modern-day Northern Territory.. Upon departure, most British regiments proceeded on to India where they saw further service. Many British soldiers, however, chose to stay in Australia, taking their discharge or transferring to the units that arrived to replace them.. The size of these forces varied over time. Initially the garrison was formed by only one regiment (battalion equivalent), however, in 1824 it rose to three. At its peak, in the 1840s, there were between four and six, although this fell to two in the early 1850s after the end of transportation and then to one by the end of the decade as troops were dispatched to India during the Indian Mutiny and to New Zealand to fight during the New Zealand Wars or were needed elsewhere in the British Empire. In the 1860s, Melbourne was used as the headquarters of the Australia and New Zealand Military Command, although by this time British forces in Australia consisted mainly of garrison artillery. The British regiments that garrisoned Australia were primarily raised in Britain; however, any Australian born subjects who wished to pursue a military career were obliged to join the British Army,. until the formation of locally raised volunteer militia units after responsible self-government was granted in each of the Australian colonies after 1855. Although the British Army did not actively recruit in Australia, \\"hundreds\\" of Australians are believed to have joined British regiments.. One Australian, Andrew Douglass White, served as an engineer officer at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815,. while another, Spicer Cookworthy, served as a subaltern in the 1st Regiment of Foot during the Crimean War.. In the mid-1860s the cost of maintaining forces in Australia became the focus of considerable debate in the House of Commons in Britain and as result in March 1862, it was \\"resolved that those colonies which had achieved responsible government would have to bear the cost of their own internal defences\\". Although the British continued to provide military forces in the way of 15 companies of infantry, these were paid for by the colonial governments in the form of a capitation payment.. Additionally, between 1856 and 1870, several different companies/batteries of the Royal Artillery served in New South Wales, as well as engineer units, marines and various support units.. There was no guarantee that these troops would remain in Australia if war broke out elsewhere and as a result,. in 1869, in response to requests for assurances in this regard the British government announced that the capitation fee would be increased and that troop numbers would be further increased. Finally, in 1870 the decision was made to withdraw the remaining regiment and as a result, by September with the departure of the 18th (Royal Irish), the withdrawal of British forces from Australia was completed,. except for a small number of Royal Marines who would remain in the country until 1913, and the local forces assumed total responsibility for the defence of the colonies.. The influence of the British Army would continue to be felt, however, through fortifications and defences that were built and in the customs, traditions, uniforms, heraldry and organisational structure that developed in the colonial forces and which, through these links, have been maintained in the modern incarnation of the Australian Army... Colonial armies=Overview= For the majority of the period from 1788 to 1870, the military forces of the Australian colonies consisted mainly of a garrison provided by the British Army.. Nevertheless, an early attempt at forming local units came in the early 1800s when loyal associations were raised to assist British forces due to concerns about unrest amongst Irish convicts. These units were short lived, however, and were disbanded around 1810 following the arrival of regular British regiments. Although there was some debate in the colonies about forming locally raised units earlier, it was not until 1840 that the first unit was raised, when the Royal South Australian Volunteer Militia was formed.. As a \\"militia\\" unit, although they were paid or partially paid and equipped via government funds, they were nevertheless citizen soldiers. Provisionally, the militia's establishment could be maintained by a compulsory ballot among men of certain ages who could be compelled to fight, albeit within certain prescribed territorial limits,. and who were generally considered to be engaged for a fixed period of service to meet an obligation.. Although this force ultimately proved unsuccessful, it sowed the seeds for further development later. In the 1850s, the provision of responsible government to the colonies led to increased responsibility and self-reliance. Additionally, around this time there were growing security concerns following the French annexation of New Caledonia and the outbreak of the Crimean War, and these factors led to the raising of several \\"volunteer\\" units in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. These formations were unpaid and were required to provide their own uniforms, although the government furnished them with arms and ammunition. As a result of their status, these units had certain privileges that militia units did not possess such as the right to elect their own officers, the ability to choose the length of their service, and being exempted from military discipline.. There was an important social distinction, too, with the volunteer forces being drawn mainly from the upper class due to being unpaid.. Over time, the distinctions between volunteer and militia units became less clear as some volunteer units became paid or partially paid, lost their right to elect their officers and increasingly became regulated; likewise, the militia, by consequence of the fact that although possible and sometimes \\"threatened\\", the compulsory ballot was never enacted, was essentially a volunteer force as its establishment was always maintained by voluntary enlistment. During the 1860s, as British troops were sent to New Zealand to fight in the New Zealand Wars the need for the colonies to provide for their own defence was highlighted further. In response volunteer units were raised in Tasmania in 1859, followed by Queensland a year later and Western Australia in 1861. The majority of the volunteers were located in Victoria, which was the largest and economically the most prosperous colony, and regardless of the efforts of these colonies, for the rest of the decade, the colonial forces were plagued by problems of discipline, a lack of purpose, obsolete equipment, heavy financial burdens upon members, poor training and a lack of command and control. Not only did this affect the efficiency of the colonial forces, it also resulted in considerable fluctuations in troop numbers. The dispatch of about several thousand volunteers to fight in New Zealand in the early 1860s also reduced the manpower available.. Further strategic concerns such as the American Civil War, Russian involvement in Afghanistan and the Franco-German War in the 1860s and 1870s, made defence reform an important item in many colonial parliaments and a number of committees and commissions were formed.. The situation regarding the question of colonial defence measures had come to a head in 1870 when British forces stopped garrisoning the colonies. In response, the colonies took the first steps towards the creation of a regular or \\"permanent\\" force when small forces of infantry and artillery were raised in Victoria and New South Wales.. Other reforms that took place around this time included the organisation of units into standard formations such as battalions, increased payments to volunteers, land grants for efficient service, the establishment of annual training camps ‚Äì usually over Easter ‚Äì the creation of cadres of professional soldiers, known as \\"permanent staff\\" to provide training, the requirement for officers and non commissioned officers to pass exams and the establishment of minimum required attendance. Sir Peter Scratchley who, along with William Jervois, authored the Jervois-Scratchley reports, which were instrumental in the development of Australia's colonial forces after the withdrawal of the British Army. In the late 1870s the colonies began to consider working together to provide for the defence of the Australian continent when two British engineer officers, Major General William Jervois and Lieutenant Colonel Peter Scratchley arrived to serve as defence advisors to the colonial governments.. The following decade a number of inter-colonial conferences were undertaken and this set the scene for further co-operation later, when Queensland and the other colonies worked together to annex parts of New Guinea due to concerns about German imperial interests in the Pacific in 1883.. This continued when the six colonies worked together to fund and establish coastal defences on Thursday Island and at King George's Sound, near Albany in Western Australia in the mid-1890s, due to the recognised strategic importance of these points which \\"commanded important trade routes\\" to all the colonies. Further co-operation came when, in July 1899, the permanent artillery forces of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria were grouped together to form the Royal Australian Artillery Regiment.. The early 1880s saw a rapid increase in the size of the colonial military forces. Between 1883 and 1885, the force rose from 8,000 to 22,000 men, although only roughly 1,000 of these were permanent soldiers. In 1885, unpaid volunteer soldiering returned following the dispatch of a contingent of New South Wales soldiers to fight in the Sudan led to fears of a Russian attack on Australia. The resultant wave of patriotism forced the colonial governments to allow citizens to form new units of \\"second-line\\" troops who were not as well trained as the paid volunteers or voluntary militiamen. This wave of patriotism resulted in the development of the concept of mounted infantry soldiers within Australian forces, which would later be used in the Boer War and in the First World War as the \\"light horse\\", and it was around this time that an Australian character arguably began to develop amongst the colonial forces. In 1889, Major General Bevan Edwards surveyed the military forces of the colonies and recommended that the colonies should combine their military forces and recommending the creation of a unified force of between 30,000 and 40,000 men, which would be organised into standard brigades consisting of foot and mounted infantry, engineers and artillery that could be rapidly mobilised through the establishment of defensive agreements between the colonies... For the most part up until that time colonial defensive strategy had revolved around the principle of static defence by infantry forces supported by coastal artillery, however, Edwards argued that through co-operative measures such as the standardisation of equipment and training, unification of command and improvements in railway and telegraph communications, \\"efficient defence\\" would be possible.. In the following decade, after a number of inter-colonial conferences, in the mid-1890s plans began to be developed regarding the establishment of a federal voluntary militia, although this fell through due when colonial rivalries prevented it from being established. The 1890s were also a period of economic hardship in Australia, the result of which was a reduction in the size of the permanent forces in a number of colonies, decreased training opportunities, reductions in pay for militia and decreased turn out in volunteer units, although this last effect was largely turned around by the mid-1890s when members of the militia and permanent forces who had been turned out due to economic circumstances joined the ranks of the volunteers.. At the same time, industrial disputes in Victoria and Queensland, led to the call out of military forces. Although these deployments successfully restored peace, it arguably led to the distrust of the military by working class Australians which later,. along with competing imperial and national priorities,. shaped the provisions of the Defence Act (1903) which was enacted to establish the structure of the Australian Army after Federation and which firmly established the Army at that time as a \\"home service army\\" made up primarily of citizen soldiers.. In late 1899, the outbreak of fighting in South Africa against the Boers, resulted in the dispatch of contingents from all colonies and an increase in volunteers serving in local units in Australia. Finally, on 1 March 1901, three months after the Federation of Australia became a reality, the Australian Army was formed and all colonial forces came under its control.. Upon establishment, the authorised strength of the colonial forces that were transferred amounted to 1,665 officers and 28,385 other ranks, of which only 115 officers and 1,323 were permanent.. The actual strength was a little below this establishment, consisting of only 1,480 officers and 25,873 other ranks. This included forces that were at that time deployed in South Africa which were also transferred to the Commonwealth.. =New South Wales= The first military forces raised in the colony of New South Wales were formed in June 1801, when \\"loyal associations\\" formed mainly from free settlers, were established in Sydney and Parramatta in response to concerns about a possible uprising by Irish convicts. Consisting of about 50 men each,. and receiving training from non commissioned officers of the New South Wales Corps, these associations are reputed to have been \\"reasonably efficient\\". In 1803, in light of the influx of Irish political exiles a concerned Governor Phillip King, raised the Governor's Body Guard, a mounted unit, drawing its personnel from emancipists and former convicts who had been of excellent behaviour during their sentences... A painting depicting the departure of the New South Wales Contingent to Sudan in 1885 On 4 March 1804, when the New South Wales Corps went into action to put down the Castle Hill convict rebellion, the locally raised Governor's Body Guard conducted reconnaissance patrols in front of the New South Wales Corps as they advanced towards the rebels, militia personnel from the Sydney and Parramatta Loyal Associations had taken over the role of guarding strategic locations to free up men from the New South Wales Corps.. This unit was later disbanded in 1810, however, following the departure of the New South Wales Corps and the arrival of regular British infantry regiments, while the Governor's Body Guard was eventually amalgamated with the Mounted Police in the mid-1840s, before eventually being disbanded in 1860.. Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 reductions in the size of the British Army began concerning the then Governor of New South Wales, Lachlan Macquarie, and it was at this point that considerations were given to forming a militia force in the colony, consisting four troops of cavalry and eight companies of infantry.. These plans, however, were not acted upon, as the British garrison was expanded in the 1820s. Further plans were made in the 1840s and early 1850s, but these also came to nothing... The first steps towards developing a defence manufacturing industry in Australia came in 1845, however, when 5.5-inch mortar shells went into production in Sydney to meet the demand for high trajectory fire support for British infantry attacks on Maori forts in New Zealand. With the outbreak of the Crimean War in 1854, however, a local voluntary force consisting of one troop of cavalry, one battery of artillery, and a battalion of infantry was raised.. The infantry force, consisting of six companies, was known as the Volunteer Sydney Rifle Corps. At its peak, the size of the New South Wales forces at this time was 389 men,. however, following the cessation of hostilities with Russia in Crimea, these forces struggled to maintain numbers and government funding. By 1855 New South Wales had been granted responsible self-government and increasingly took responsibility for its own affairs. The colony remained within, and was fiercely loyal to, the British Empire, and while the Colonial Office continued to determine foreign policy, the decision was taken in London that the Australian colonies would need to start taking responsibility for their own defence. In 1860, as British Army units were being sent to New Zealand, New South Wales attempted to raise a volunteer force of 1,700 men.. This number was almost achieved with 1,644 volunteers enlisting, who were formed into one troop of mounted rifles, three batteries of artillery, and 20 companies of infantry. To encourage enlistments, land grants were offered in 1867. It was not considered a success. In 1868, these were later organised into a battalion and regimental structure.. The Volunteer Sydney Rifle Corps ceased to exist, being subsumed into the 20 company-strong 1st Regiment, New South Wales Rifle Volunteers. During the New Zealand Wars, although the colony had no official role, New South Wales contributed significantly to the 2,500 volunteers that were sent from Australia in 1863. The 1850s and 1860s saw further development of the system of defensive fortifications around Sydney. As a result of concerns about Russian attack, the construction of Fort Denison was completed and in 1856 gunners from the Royal Artillery arrived to man the defences. In 1863, a select committee had been formed. As a result of its recommendations, batteries were established along the principles of \\"outer\\" and \\"inner\\" lines making use of the newer, rifled weapons that had become available, which were established in barbettes along the living rock around the harbour.. In 1865 John Soame Richardson was appointed to the command of the military forces of New South Wales, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1869 the decision to withdraw all British units in 1870 had been confirmed. By 1871 the withdrawal of British forces from New South Wales was completed, and the local forces assumed total responsibility for the defence of New South Wales. In order to meet this requirement, in 1870 the New South Wales government decided to raise a \\"regular\\" or permanent military force, consisting of two infantry companies and one artillery battery, which were raised the following year. The infantry companies were short lived, being disbanded in 1873, however, the artillery battery, known as 'A' Field Battery, was successfully established in August 1871 to replace the units of the Royal Artillery that returned to Britain. Nevertheless, the majority of the New South Wales military were part-time, volunteer forces, which around this time consisted of about 28 companies of infantry and nine batteries of artillery. The entire force was reorganised by the Volunteer Regulation Act of 1867, which also gave provision for land grants in recognition of five years service. The 1870s saw major improvements to the structure and organisation of New South Wales' colonial forces. Land grants for service were abolished after the government became aware that some members were selling the land for profit rather that living on it themselves, and partial payments introduced. 1876 saw a second permanent artillery battery established, and a year later a third was added.. In 1877, the Engineers Corps and Signals Corps were established while in 1882 and in 1891 the Commissariat and Transport Corps, later to be known as the Army Service Corps, were raised.. The physical infrastructure of defence in the colony was also improved, largely due to the recommendations of Jervois and Scratchley, with new forts such as Fort Scratchley and Bare Island being built, while existing locations were upgraded with new rifled muzzle loading guns. An artillery piece being established at Middle Head, 1891 When the government of New South Wales received news in February 1885, of the death of General Charles Gordon at Khartoum during the short-lived British campaign against the Dervish revolt in the eastern Sudan,. they offered the British forces there the service of New South Wales forces.. The offer was accepted, and within two weeks a force of 30 officers and 740 men comprising an infantry battalion, with artillery and support units, was enrolled, re-equipped and dispatched for Africa. They were farewelled from Circular Quay in Sydney on 3 March 1885 by an enormous public gathering and marching bands.. The contingent was led by John Soame Richardson. Charles Fyshe Roberts assumed command of the New South Wales forces in Richardson's absence. The New South Wales Sudan contingent arrived at Suakin on the Red Sea on 29 March 1885.. There they joined Lieutenant General Gerald Graham's two British brigade's efforts against Osman Digna. Within a month of arriving, the New South Wales detachment had seen action at Tamai,. becoming the first Australian raised military force to do so. By May 1885, the campaign had been reduced to a series of small skirmishes, the most significant of which for the New South Wales contingent came at Takdul on 6 May.. Shortly afterwards, the British government requested to deploy the contingent to India where there were concerns about Russian intentions in Afghanistan, however public opinion in the colony was against the deployment.. They subsequently returned to Sydney by 23 June 1885. Despite their service, and their engagements at Tamai and Takdul, the New South Wales Sudan contingent was ridiculed by the media upon their return to New South Wales. Nevertheless, the contingent's efforts were recognised with an official battle honour ‚Äì \\"Suakin 1885\\" ‚Äì which was the first battle honour awarded to an Australian unit. The New South Wales School of Gunnery was established at Middle Head in 1885, while full volunteers were instituted again that year.. At this time it was decided to raise a volunteer corps of cavalry who although they were required to supply their own horses, were to also be partially paid, and had uniforms and weapons supplied. They were eventually formed as a light horse unit and were known as the New South Wales Lancers.. Another unit to be raised at this time was the Upper Clarence Light Horse, which had initially been raised by its colonel, Sir Charles Chauvel, father of Harry Chauvel, with the intention of being sent to India if the Russians became involved in Afghanistan; the offer was later rejected, however, when the men were attested they swore to volunteer for overseas service.. Previous mounted rifles were merged with the Lancers. A further four batteries of reserve artillery were raised in 1885, but disbanded in 1892. The permanent forces also added units of submarine miners and mounted infantry, which were also soon disbanded.. The 1890s saw much restructuring, amidst economic hardships, with many units being formed and disbanded soon after, or merged with other units. Training opportunities were also reduced as the planned annual camps of 1892 and 1893, and militia pay levels, were reduced. Between 1893 and 1896, Major General Edward Hutton, a British Army officer, commanded the New South Wales Forces. He would later be instrumental in establishing the newly formed Australian Army. In 1894, a small group of New South Wales officers were offered the opportunity to serve with units of the British Indian Army to gain operational experience. Following in the footsteps of Captain Henry Airey, an artillery officer who had served with the British in 1887 in the Anglo-Burmese War and received the first Distinguished Service Order awarded to an Australian,. at Hutton's behest four New South Wales officers, including Captain James Macarthur-Onslow, took up the offer. After completing his secondment, Macarthur-Onslow volunteered to delay his return and took part in the Chitral Expedition in early 1895.. Many of the volunteer units that were raised around this time often had affiliations with expatriate groups, and names such as the Scottish Rifles, the Irish Rifles, the St. George's Rifles, and the Australian Rifles, reflected this. By 1897, there was also the 1st Australian Volunteer Horse and the Railway Volunteer Corps, and a \\"National Guard\\" of volunteer veterans.. The colony also began recruiting a small number of doctors, nurses, supply troops and engineer and machine gun units were raised. By 1900, the Civil Service Volunteer Infantry Corps, the University Volunteer Rifles Corps,. the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, the Drummoyne Volunteer Company, the Army Nursing Service Reserve and Army Medical Corps had also been added. A trooper of the New South Wales Mounted Rifles, c. 1900 Hostilities commenced in the Boer War in October 1899, and all the Australian colonies agreed to send troops in support of the British cause. The First New South Wales Contingent arrived in South Africa in November 1899. New South Wales' contribution was the largest amongst all of the colonies, with a total of 4,761 men being sent prior to Federation either at the colony's or Imperial expense. A further 1,349 were sent later as part of Commonwealth forces. The total size of the New South Wales contingent over the entire war was 6,110 troops of all ranks, which was broken down into 314 officers, and 5,796 other ranks. These men served various units including the New South Wales Infantry Company, the New South Wales Lancers, the New South Wales Mounted Rifles, the New South Wales Citizens Bushmen, and the New South Wales Imperial Bushmen. One member of the New South Wales forces, Lieutenant Neville Howse, a doctor in the New South Wales Medical Corps, received the Victoria Cross for his actions during the war, rescuing a wounded soldier under fire at Vredefort in July 1900.. A small detachment of New South Wales permanent infantry were deployed to China in September 1900 as part of the New South Wales Naval Brigade during the Boxer Rebellion. They returned to Australia in March 1901 without taking part in any significant actions.. A survey of New South Wales' military forces on 31 December 1900, the day before Federation, found that the active forces consisted of 505 officers and 8,833 other ranks, 26 nurses, and 1906 civilian rifle club members. In addition to these forces, there was an inactive reserve of 130 officers and 1,908 other ranks. =Tasmania= In 1802, amidst the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars, concerns about French interest in Australia drove an expansion of the British colony.. French explorers had been encountered in the Pacific and in order to secure any strategic locations within the southern station of the Pacific Ocean which might have been of use to France, King dispatched an expedition to settle Van Diemen's Land. John Bowen, a 23-year-old lieutenant, had arrived in Sydney aboard HMS Glatton, on 11 March 1803. King considered him the right man for the task, and towards the end of August 1803, Bowen left for Van Diemen's Land aboard the whaler . Accompanying him were three female and 21 male convicts, guarded by a company of the New South Wales Corps, as well as a small number of free settlers. A second ship, the , joined them and in early September 1803 a settlement was established at Risdon Cove.. At the same time David Collins departed from England in April 1803, aboard with orders to establish a colony at Port Phillip. After establishing a short lived settlement near the current site of Sorrento, he wrote to King, expressing his dissatisfaction with the location, and seeking permission to relocate the settlement to the Derwent River. Realising that the fledgling settlement at Risdon Cove would be well reinforced by Collins' arrival, King agreed to the proposal. Collins arrived at the Derwent River on 16 February 1804, aboard Ocean. The settlement that Bowen had established at Risdon Cove did not impress Collins, and he decided to relocate the settlement down river, on the opposite shore. They landed at Sullivans Cove on 21 February 1804, and created the settlement that was to become Hobart. Soon after this, Collins decided that coastal defence was needed. A redoubt was dug not far from the settlement, and two ship's guns were placed within.. In 1810, the colony's garrison, which had until that time been provided by the New South Wales Corps, was relieved. They were subsequently replaced by a British regular infantry unit, the 73rd Regiment of Foot, which rotated duties between Sydney and Hobart. The following year, when Governor Lachlan Macquarie toured the Hobart Town settlement, he was alarmed at the poor state of defence, and the general disorganisation of the colony. Along with planning for a new grid of streets to be laid out, and new administrative and other buildings to be constructed, he commissioned the building of Anglesea Barracks, which opened by 1814.. The same year, the 73rd was replaced by the 46th (South Devonshire) Regiment of Foot, who subsequently undertook a series of operations against bushrangers. By 1818, the Mulgrave Battery, consisting of six guns, had been built on Castray Esplanade, on the southern side of Battery Point upon the orders of Lieutenant Governor William Sorell. In 1824 the battery was expanded to include two 13-pounders and four 9-pounders; two other guns, 6-pounder brass pieces, were positioned in Angelsea Barracks. The period of 1828 until 1832 was a violent one in the history of Van Diemen's Land. The rising friction and continuing conflicts between settlers and indigenous Tasmanians led to a declaration of martial law by Lieutenant Governor George Arthur.. British regiments came into open conflict with the Aboriginals in what has since been dubbed the \\"Black War\\". In 1830, during the \\"Black Line\\" incident, groups of armed settlers and even some convicts began a series of military style operations in an effort to push the Tasmanian Aboriginals into a small pocket of land on the Tasman Peninsula in an unsuccessful attempt to isolate them,. and prevent further conflicts between the two groups.. In 1838 plans were drawn up for a more elaborate network of coastal fortifications. Money did not permit all of the batteries to be established, but work was begun on the Queens Battery, located at the site of the regatta ground on the Queens Domain. The battery was set back by delays and funding problems, and was not completed until 1864 having taken more than 24 years.. By 1840, the newly arrived commander of the Royal Engineers, Major Roger Kelsall, was alarmed to discover how inadequately defended the now growing colony was. He drew up plans for the expansion of the Mulgrave Battery, and an additional fortification further up the slopes of Battery Point. Work began the same year using convict labour, and soon the Prince of Wales Battery, consisting of 10 guns, was completed.. Despite these improvements, the battery was badly sited. As a result, at the height of the Crimean War in 1854, a third battery, known as the Prince Albert Battery was completed even higher behind the Prince of Wales Battery. By 1862, the guns allocated to these batteries were: four 32-pounders in the Albert Battery, six 32-pounders and four 8-inch in the Prince of Wales Battery and seven 32-pounders and four 8-inch in the Queens Battery. Another two 32-pounders were located at Denison.. The Queens Battery, August 1869 In the late 1840s the question of raising local forces was considered; the size of the British garrison in the colony at the time was around 1,500, which was deemed more than sufficient to meet the colony's needs. As a result, it was estimated that only two artillery companies were required to augment the British garrison, which could be raised from among the local populace. This proposal was not acted upon, however.. Following the decline of British military presence in Tasmania, the Governor of Tasmania felt the need to establish military forces capable of defending the colony. In 1859, the first local forces were raised in Tasmania.. These consisted of two batteries of \\"volunteer\\" artillery, the Hobart Town Artillery Company and the Launceston Volunteer Artillery Company, which had initially begun its service as an infantry unit under the designation of the Launceston Volunteer Artillery Corps.. Twelve companies of \\"volunteer\\" infantry were also raised. This force totalled 1,200 men. The infantry units that were raised at the time bore titles such as the Freemasons Corps, the Oddfellows, the Manchester Unity, the Buckingham Rifles, The City Guards, the Kingborough Rifles, the Derwent Rifles and the Huon Rifles.. By 1865, the size of the colony's volunteer force began to decline.. Although the infantry companies were disbanded in 1867, the artillery was increased by one battery. 1870 saw the complete withdrawal of British forces from Tasmania, which left the colony virtually defenceless. The existing fortresses had fallen into a state of decay and it was decided that the Prince of Wales and Prince Albert Batteries were inadequate for the defence of the town. As a result, in 1871 work was begun on another battery but it was stopped when funding ran out.. Even if work had been completed, though, the battery would have been ineffective as there were no artillerymen to service the guns, as the Hobart Artillery had \\"practically ceased to exist\\",. a situation which had also affected the Queens Battery, consisting of 10 guns, by the time also. In 1871, the Russian corvette Boyarin entered the Derwent unexpectedly. Nevertheless, between 1870 and 1878, the government was unwilling to provide funds for local forces. When funding became available again in 1878, the Tasmanian Volunteer Force was established under the provisions of the Volunteer Act; Windle St Hill was commandant of the local forces from June 1878 to May 1880. This force consisted of two artillery batteries and four companies of infantry in Hobart and another battery and two infantry companies in Launceston. The following year the Tasmanian Light Horse was raised in Launceston.. 1880 saw a reorganisation as the force was re-designated the \\"Local Forces of Tasmania\\", which were formed into two divisions spread across the north and south of the colony.. By 1882, when Russian ships ‚Äì the Afrika, Plastun, and Vyestnik ‚Äì again paid the colony a visit,. the strength of the colony's military was 634 men. Further reorganisations under commandant Colonel William Vincent Legge in 1882‚Äì83 resulted in the establishment of an engineer corps establishment, the disbandment of the light horse and the withdrawal of the right of the volunteer forces to elect their officers.. In 1885 annual Easter training camps were established;. that year the size of Tasmania's military force had grown to 974 men. Work on the Kangaroo Bluff Battery was also completed at this time with the arrival of two 12.5 ton cannons from England. The first shots were fired on 12 February 1885.. The Alexandra battery was also finished in 1885,. and a force of permanent artillery was raised the following year... However, by 1893, an additional \\"auxiliary\\" force of 1,500 had also been raised and three years later the regiment consisted of three battalions, numbered consecutively, which were based in Hobart, Launceston and in the north west. The economic depression of the early 1890s resulted in a reduction in the size of the colony's permanent artillery. In addition drastic cuts in payments for stores, grants and training also occurred. By the middle of the decade Tasmania's permanent artillery was basically ineffective, having been reduced to just eight men.. The colony's artillery holdings the following year were four 12-pounder breech loaded (BL) guns and two 2.5-inch rifled muzzle loaders (RMLs). Despite the lack of government funding, however, between 1895 and 1897 volunteer units held a number of unpaid training camps.. In 1897, a reorganisation of Tasmania's infantry saw the creation of the Tasmanian Regiment of Infantry, which was established with three battalions.. Government funded training recommenced in 1898 and the following year a mounted infantry force and a medical corps was formed.. Men of the 2nd Wiltshire Regiment and Tasmanian Imperial Bushmen along the Orange River c. 1900. During the Boer War, the first Tasmanian colonial force that was dispatched was an infantry company that had been raised solely from members of the Tasmanian colonial forces, which departed in October 1899. Together with companies from four other colonies, they initially formed the 1st Australian Regiment.. They were later converted into a mounted force and assigned to the 4th Mounted Infantry Corps seeing action at Hout Nek, Zand River, Bloemfontein, Diamond Hill, Balmoral, Belfast, Karee Kloof, Brandfort, Vet River, Zand River, Elandsfontein, Johannesburg, and Diamond River before returning to Australia in December 1900. The colony's second contingent left in February 1900. Drawing its personnel both from serving soldiers and civilians who volunteered for service, who were grouped together in the Tasmanian Citizens Bushmen, it was a mounted infantry unit. These mounted infantry units were primarily made up of volunteers who had good bushcraft, riding and shooting skills. They subsequently served in Rhodesia and western Transvaal. The first two Victoria Crosses awarded to Australians in that conflict were earned by Private John Bisdee and Lieutenant Guy Wylly, both members of the Tasmanian Bushmen, in action near Warm Bad in 1900.. A total of 179 Tasmanian troops were provided at the colony's expense, while a further 375 were provided under Imperial funds. Another 303 Tasmanians served as part of Commonwealth units. On 31 December 1900 the day before Federation, a survey of the strength of colonial forces found that the Tasmanian colonial forces consisted of 113 officers and 1,911 other ranks. Upon Federation, all of the Australian colonial forces came under the control of the Federal Government of Australia. As a result, the Tasmanian Mounted Infantry units were redesignated as the 12th Australian Light Horse Regiment in 1903,. while the three battalions of the Tasmanian Volunteer Rifle Regiment were re-designated as part of the Citizens Military Force becoming the Derwent Infantry Regiment (Hobart), the Launceston Regiment (Launceston), and the Tasmanian Rangers (North West). =Western Australia= In the early 19th century, rumours of plans for a French colony in Western Australia drove British authorities to establish their own.. In December 1826 the 1st/39th Regiment arrived at the King George Sound Settlement.. In 1827, Captain James Stirling sighted the area surrounding the Swan River as being suitable for agriculture, and upon his return to England in July 1828, lobbied for the establishment of a free settler colony, unlike the penal settlements of eastern Australia. The British Government assented, and a fleet led by Charles Fremantle, aboard HMS Challenger returned along with two other vessels, Parmelia and HMS Sulphur, including a detachment of the 63rd Regiment of Foot, arriving to establish the Swan River Colony in 1829.. In 1831, the 1st/39th Regiment left King George Sound. Following the establishment of the Swan River Colony (later known as Western Australia), a detachment from 2nd/40th Regiment who were garrisoned in Sydney at the time, was dispatched to the new colony. Following them, were detachments from most of the regiments that were also serving in New South Wales. In addition to the British garrison, a small locally raised unit, known as the Swan River Volunteers, was established in 1829; all settlers between 15 and 50 years of age were obligated to serve and were required to supply their own weapons. Although provisions were made to pay these volunteers, the organisation was not successful, however, as the settlements were dispersed over wide areas, making concentration difficult, while economic considerations meant that it was not fully supported by settlers.. In the early 1850s, a force of \\"enrolled pensioners\\" ‚Äì former soldiers ‚Äì were sent to the colony to bolster the British regular garrison and to guard convicts... The Swan River Volunteers were reformed in 1860, although this proved short lived. In 1861 the British garrison was withdrawn from Western Australia, and so that year an Act of Parliament was passed authorising the creation of a corps of volunteers. Around this time, the colony's military forces totalled about 700 men serving in foot and mounted infantry units, organised into the Western Australian Volunteer Force which was raised primarily in Perth, Fremantle and Pinjarra. By 1862 the force consisted of units such as the Perth Volunteer Rifles, the Fremantle Volunteer Rifles and the Pinjarra Mounted Volunteers... Training was hard to come by, and although the unit was enthusiastic, records show that discipline and poor attendance became a problem as the number of volunteers fell. In an effort to rectify the situation, by January 1869, the government had introduced regulations relating to training and attendance, and although the force remained volunteer, a system of payments was instituted for those who met the minimum requirement of attendance to be considered \\"efficient\\". Nevertheless, overall funding remained low and by 1872 there were just 365 men \\"under arms\\". Frederick Bell of the Western Australian Mounted Infantry who received a Victoria Cross for his actions at Brakpan in May 1901 Although the situation improved, the force was still amateurish. A reorganisation followed, and on 17 June 1872 the Metropolitan Rifle Volunteers were formed, with companies in Fremantle, Guildford, Albany, Geraldton, Northampton and York.. In 1872, a troop from the West Australian Mounted Volunteers was converted to a horse artillery unit when they were entrusted with two breech-loading 12-pounders that had previously belonged to the enrolled pensioners that had been sent to the colony to guard convicts prior to the end of transportation.. Further reorganisation occurred and in 1874 the infantry units of Perth, Fremantle and Guildford were amalgamated administratively to form the 1st Battalion, Western Australian Volunteers.. More changes came the following year when promotions for officers were tied to examination performance, and field and barracks training was made available for all ranks. Corps were brought together annually, normally over Easter to practice manoeuvres, during which smaller units were merged with larger units; training became more organised and professional instructors were enlisted.. By 1880 mounted infantry units had been established in Bunbury and Perth; that same year the force of enrolled pensioners was disbanded.. In 1883, the colony's military became subject to British military law in the event of war, although under the provisions of the Volunteer Force Regulation Act 1883 a number of limitations were placed on its application. Around 1884, the colony's volunteer infantry were grouped into five battalion-level organisations: the Western Australian Volunteers, the Metropolitan Rifle Volunteers, the Albany Rifle Volunteers, the Geraldton Rifle Volunteers and the Fremantle Rifle Volunteers. That same year, the first annual continuous training camp took place. Held over the Easter weekend, camps took place at Albion and Geraldton.. By 1885, the size of the colony's military force was just 578 men, although this increased to just over 700 in 1890. During the Russian war scare of 1885, however, Western Australia's mobilisation was small compared to other the colonies and limited only to an Easter muster of under 400 men. At King George's Sound, strategically important as a coaling station, the local force, the Albany Rifles, had disbanded due to \\"disorganisation and inefficiency\\" and although another unit, the Albany Defence Rifles, was raised at this time to fill the void, it was disbanded shortly after the crisis abated.. Further annual camps took place in 1888 at Greenmount and at Guildford the following year. Nevertheless, when Edwards delivered his report into the state of military forces in Western Australia in 1889, his assessment was that \\"they were of little value as [a] defence force\\".. In 1890, in an effort to encourage participation an efficiency bonus was introduced which saw payments being made to volunteers who paraded 12 times a year and completed basic musketry training. An economic downturn occurred shortly after this however, and this, coupled with the increased costs of maintaining the volunteer force,. affected the government's ability to provide funding for training. In early 1893, a force from the Plantagenet Rifles, a volunteer infantry unit, were trained as gunners to assist the permanent force of South Australian artillery that had were manning the fort at Albany.. Due to improvements in the economic circumstances of the colonies after the depression in the early 1890s, eight new artillery pieces, 9-pounder RMLs, were purchased in 1894; although these were technically obsolescent, they were nevertheless an improvement on the two 12-pounder Armstrong guns that they replaced.. In 1896, the colony's artillery consisted of eight 9-pounders of the RML type and two 12-pounder RBL guns. From 1893 to 1898 an annual camp was held in the vicinity of Perth, bringing together most of the force, although units from remote regions continued to undertake their training in isolation. In 1897, a system of \\"partial pay\\" was instituted. In 1899, an artillery force was raised by the colony to take over duties at Albany; this force was known as the Albany Volunteer Garrison Artillery. In July 1899, the 1st Infantry Regiment was formed from the 1st Battalion, Western Australian Volunteers, with three companies in Perth and Fremantle and one in Guildford. The outbreak of the Boer War saw troops from the colony being sent to South Africa to fight. During the conflict, 349 men were dispatched from Western Australia at state expense, while a further 574 were deployed and paid for through Imperial funds. Another 306 were dispatched as Commonwealth troops later after 1901. One member of the Western Australian Mounted Infantry, Lieutenant Frederick Bell, received the Victoria Cross during the conflict. By the time the men had returned from war, Australia had federated and become the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Western Australian Defence Force, which then consisted of one mounted infantry regiment, two field artillery batteries, two garrison artillery companies, and an infantry brigade consisting of five battalions,. were amalgamated into the newly formed Australian Army. On 31 December 1900, the day before Federation, a survey of the strength of colonial forces found that the Western Australian colonial forces consisted of 135 officers and 2,561 other ranks. =South Australia= South Australian Volunteer Forces in 1860 South Australia was the only British colony in Australia which was not a convict colony. It was established as a planned free colony, and began on 28 December 1836. As such, garrisons were not required as prison guards, unlike the other colonies. However, Governor John Hindmarsh was escorted on by a contingent of nineteen Royal Marines. They were assigned to protect him and left South Australia when he departed the colony on on 14 July 1838. A lack of any form of defence however, led to the creation of the Royal South Australian Volunteer Militia, consisting of an infantry company and two cavalry troops, in 1840, although it was disbanded in 1851; for the final six years of its existence it had been a force that had existed on paper only.. The first artillery pieces arrived in South Australia aboard Buffalo, which landed two 18-pound cannons, but initially there were no moves to form an artillery unit, so the guns were operated by Royal Engineers.. In 1844 a request for further pieces was sent to the British government and two years later two light 6-pounders, two 12-pounder howitzers and two Cohorn mortars arrived with an ammunition store of about 500 rounds for each weapon type.. Despite the setback of the first attempt to form a militia, the idea of self-support was entirely ingrained in the foundation of the South Australian colony, and so in 1854 the Militia Act was passed, which allowed for compulsory enlistment of a force of 2,000 men between the ages of 16 and 46, although this option was never pursued. On 4 November 1854, amidst concerns surrounding the Crimean War, a new attempt was made to raise local militia forces in South Australia. The government proclaimed a general order that established the South Australian Volunteer Militia Force, which was to be organised into two battalions, each consisting of six companies of between 50 and 60 men, which would be known as the Adelaide Rifles. The men received 36 days training, and then returned to their civilian jobs until needed. This force was short lived though, being disbanded upon the end of the Crimean War in 1856.. A small force of artillery ‚Äì about two companies ‚Äì and some cavalry were also raised during this time, although almost no training was carried out and the artillery was employed mainly to fire a single shot every day from Port Adelaide to mark noon.. A request for a further consignment of artillery pieces had been sent to Britain in 1854, but it was not until 1857 that the guns arrived. Two 9-pounders, two 6-pounders and four howitzers were received at this time. However, the colonial government still felt uneasy about being undefended and a \\"war scare\\" with the French prompted further legislative revision.. The Volunteer Force was reformed in 1859, and soon numbered 14 companies. The Adelaide Volunteer Artillery and the Port Adelaide Volunteer Artillery were also raised at this time. Worldwide artillery shortages due to the demands of the belligerents involved in the American Civil War meant that plans to expand the colony's artillery holdings were thwarted; as a result South Australia's armament consisted of only two 9-pounders, four 6-pounders, two 24-pound howitzers, four 12-pound howitzers and two Cohorn mortars. By the following year, the numbers of infantry had increased to 45 companies with a total of 70 officers and 2,000 men of other ranks. On 26 April 1860, the Adelaide Regiment of Volunteer Rifles was formed. In 1865 South Australia became the first state to introduce partially paid volunteers, which was a system all of the other colonies were soon to follow. This was brought about by the enacting of the Volunteer Act (1865) which divided all military forces into active and reserve forces. Due to organisational problems and lack of equipment, the Adelaide Regiment of Volunteer Rifles was again disbanded in early 1866, only to be reformed again in May 1866. By 16 November 1867, the Adelaide Regiment of Volunteer Rifles had been re-designated as the \\"Prince Alfred's Rifle Volunteers\\" following the Duke of Edinburgh's visit to Australia, but lack of funding saw them disbanded. A company of expatriate Scottish immigrants had formed The Scottish Company in 1865, and reformed as The Duke of Edinburgh's Own on 18 November 1867.. In 1868, the colony's Whitworth 12-pounder guns, which had been purchased the year before, were fired for the first time when they were exercised at Glenelg.. That year the two artillery companies were merged to form the South Australian Regiment of Volunteer Artillery.. The outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in France on 19 July 1870, led the South Australian Governor, Sir James Fergusson, to conduct a review of the colony's defences. He determined to reorganise the force into two battalions of 500‚Äì600 men, two artillery batteries, and four troops of cavalry. However, his proposals received little backing from the colonial parliament, and were rejected by newly re-elected Premier John Hart. Some politicians felt it would help alleviate the high unemployment the colony was suffering at the time, but the majority felt the enormous cost outweighed the potential benefits. Once again the issue of funding stood in the way of South Australia having an efficient and ready regular military force.. The issue continued to be debated until 1875 when interest in military expansion was renewed amongst the colonial politicians. The government had been quite unstable for the first five years of the 1870s, but settled in 1875, allowing for more stable planning. Once again affairs of empires played a part. Russia was once again being perceived as a threat by all of the colonial governments following the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì78. Politicians came under pressure from the press and campaign groups to expand the defensive capacity of the colony. Finally in May 1877, the South Australian Volunteer Military Forces was reformed consisting primarily of 10 companies of the Adelaide Rifles. The success of raising those units did not stop the political arguments over the issue with wrangling between Governor Sir William Jervois and Premier John Colton temporarily suspending further development.. Despite all of the political setbacks, the Adelaide Rifles had soon grown to 21 companies, and on 4 July 1877 a second battalion was formed. The second battalion comprised the companies from Mount Gambier, Unley, and Port Pirie together with the Duke of Edinburgh's Own of Prince Alfred Rifle Volunteers. Training intensified briefly for the duration of the Russo-Turkish War, and then resumed at normal levels, with the 2nd Battalion being amalgamated with the 1st Battalion.. alt= The two artillery companies were reformed at this time under the guidance of Colonel Major Francis Downes, a Royal Artillery officer. The \\"company\\" designation was dropped and \\"battery\\" was adopted, with the two subunits being designated 'A' and 'B' Battery. The colony's armament was boosted by the arrival of eight RML 16-pounder heavy field guns. In 1879, following the British defeat by the Zulus at Isandlwana, South Australia offered to send a contingent of troops to aid the British response. This offer was rejected, however.. Although provisions had been made for a permanent artillery force to be raised in South Australia this was not undertaken and instead the guns at Fort Glanville ‚Äì completed and under the command of Lieutenant Joseph Maria Gordon by 1882. ‚Äì as well as the colony's field artillery, were manned by volunteers.. By 1885, the second infantry battalion was again reformed, consisting of the same companies as previously. At this time, South Australia's military strength was 3,195 men. By this time, a second fort, at Largs had been established,. while another, Fort Glenelg, had also been planned, although by 1888 it had not been built and its guns, two 9.2-inch pieces, had been left dumped in the sand near the site.. In 1889 a third battalion of infantry was raised, although it was short lived as it was disbanded in 1895. In 1893, as part of the combined efforts of the six colonies to secure strategic points around the continent, South Australia provided a small garrison of 30 permanent artillerymen to crew three 6-inch guns that were established at Albany in King George's Sound in Western Australia.. Up until 1896, all South Australian units trained only once a year at Easter. The commitment of the men, and constant restructuring and reorganising, were in direct response to perceived threats to the colony.. By 1896, the colony's arsenal of field guns consisted of 11 pieces, of which eight were 16-pounder RML types and three were 13-pounder RMLs. The following year, the two artillery batteries were \\"brigaded\\" together under the South Australian Artillery Brigade.. Upon the outbreak of hostilities in the Boer War, many men from various South Australian units volunteered to participate with the Australian contingent. Any regiments whose men participated later received King's Colours and battle honours.. The colony contributed 1,036 personnel to the conflict under its own banner and another 490 were sent as part of Commonwealth forces. On 31 December 1900, the day before Federation, a survey of the strength of colonial forces found that the South Australian colonial forces consisted of 135 officers and 2,797 other ranks. Following South Australia's admission to the Commonwealth of Australia, all of the South Australian forces were drawn into the Australian Army. The 1st Battalion of the Regiment of Adelaide Rifles was redesignated as the 10th Australian Infantry Regiment (Adelaide Rifles), the 2nd Battalion became the South Australia Infantry Regiment, 'G' Company became the South Australia Scottish Infantry (Mount Gambier), and 'H' Company Scottish became 'G' Company (Scottish) South Australia Infantry Regiment. The artillery was also reorganised, with 'A' Battery becoming No. 1 South Australian Battery, Australian Field Artillery.. =Victoria= The first attempt to establish a settlement in what is now Victoria was made by David Collins who departed from England in April 1803, aboard HMS Calcutta with orders to establish a colony at Port Phillip.. It proved to be unsuitable and as a result was subsequently removed to Van Diemen's Land. Several journeys and explorers passed the northern coast of Bass Strait in the interim, but it was not until John Batman journeyed from Van Diemen's Land in 1835 to establish a farming community at what was to become Melbourne that the new colony was established.. The new settlement's prime locality between New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, and the natural resources of the area saw it grow rapidly. Initially the settlement was governed directly from Sydney, but by 1840, it was proposed that it should be self-governing. This was achieved on 1 July 1851. Troops storm the Eureka Stockade, December 1854 Although there had been some plans to form local forces as early as 1824,, these came to nothing and as a result, as with New South Wales, in Victoria the Crimean War served as a catalyst for the raising of volunteer forces. With only a small force of British troops in the colony, there were concerns about a possible Russian attack. As a result, at this time two units were formed, these being the Melbourne Volunteer Rifle Regiment and the Geelong Volunteer Rifle Corps. Other branches of service, such as cavalry, artillery, engineers, signals and torpedo units were raised after this, with the funding for many of these units being derived from private sources. These forces included the Victorian Yeomanry Corps.. In late December 1854 the newly formed Victorian Government faced their first crisis. Three years earlier, in 1851, gold had been discovered in Ballarat, and soon after in Bendigo, triggering the Victorian gold rush. The government imposed heavy mining taxes, which caused a miners revolt, culminating in the Eureka Stockade. About 1,000 miners fortified a position, and at 3:00 am on 3 December 1854, a party of 276 members from the 1st/12th and 2nd/40th Regiments supported by Victorian police, under the command of Captain John Thomas, approached the Eureka Stockade and a battle ensued.. The police took up holding positions on two sides of the stockade, with a further unit of mounted police held in reserve. On a third side mounted members of the 2nd/40th pressed in, supported by a combined storming party made up from members of the 2nd/40th and the 1st/12th Foot East Suffolk which approached from the north and south.. The miners, about 150 strong ‚Äì of whom 100 were armed ‚Äì were no match for the military and they were routed in less than 15 minutes,. with six soldiers and 34 miners being killed. A contingent of the 1st/99th Regiment, then serving in Tasmania, was dispatched to aid them, however they were not required.. The result of this action was the effect that it had on public opinion surrounding the issue of the British garrison's presence in Australia; a gathering of citizens in Melbourne shortly after the incident at Eureka expressed a desire for the creation of a \\"constitution under which there would be no troops in the colony but for part-time citizens soldiers recruited from among the community\\". When the Crimean War ended in 1856, many of the local units that had been raised declined as the enthusiasm of Victorians for military service dwindled. Around this time, the rifle regiments and corps that had been raised were converted to artillery. When British troops began to be redirected from the Australian colonies to New Zealand in the early 1860s there was renewed interest in Victoria for raising local forces to take over more of the responsibility for garrison duties. From 1861 Victorian forces undertook annual training at Easter with the first camp being undertaken at Werribee.. The Volunteer Act was passed in 1863, and this legislation allowed the government to raise a voluntary force consisting of various arms including infantry and artillery. There were around 13 companies of infantry volunteers in Victoria at this time, From 1863 all mounted troops in Victoria became part of the Prince of Wales' Light Horse.. By December 1863, along with the 13 companies of infantry, there was one company of engineers and seven of artillery.. In 1870, the Victorian Permanent Artillery Corps, consisting of about 300 men, was raised. The colony's first permanent, or \\"regular\\" unit, it was created to take over responsibility for manning the fortifications that the British garrison had occupied prior to their departure. They were also used to instruct volunteer artillery units. Throughout the rest of the decade, Victoria's military remained roughly the same size, although it obtained higher levels of efficiency as training opportunities were expanded and its organisation was improved. By the time that the British garrison was withdrawn in 1871, the Victorian military consisted of 206 permanent troops and 4,084 militia and volunteers. The following year, the various volunteer rifle companies were re-organised, being placed into battalion-level structures which saw the establishment of two metropolitan battalions, as well as a battalion in Ballarat and another in Mount Alexander.. In January 1879, a survey of the colony's military forces determined that there were 228 permanent staff, all of which were serving in the artillery, and 3,202 volunteers serving in the cavalry, engineers, artillery and infantry.. Leslie Maygar, a Victorian recipient of the Victoria Cross during the Boer War In 1880 the permanent artillery units were disbanded, but were later reformed in 1882 as the Victorian Garrison Artillery Corps.. In 1884, the volunteer system was abolished and in its place a partially paid militia, who were obligated to serve for a minimum number of days each year, was established.. With the exception of these changes, the others that occurred at this time were largely administrative and most units that existed before 1884 remained in existence. The following year, the Victorian Mounted Rifles ‚Äì who were the first unit to adopt the iconic slouch hat ‚Äì were formed, primarily recruiting in rural areas where men had already established horsemanship skills and thus did not need further training and were able to provide and maintain their own horse. In late 1888 or early 1889, the Victorian Rangers, a rural infantry unit, was also raised.. Both rural units were not paid well, but did receive small allowances, and were made up primarily of members of local rifle clubs. On 20 September 1889, Alexander Bruce Tulloch was appointed Commandant of the Victorian Military Forces, with the local rank of Major-General. In the early 1890s, economic hardships reduced the ability of many volunteer units to maintain regular attendance. Nevertheless, at the start of the decade the Victorian Mounted Rifles were used by the Victorian government to provide assistance to police during a maritime strike. In December 1892, men of the Echuca Company of the Victorian Rangers nearly sparked an inter-colonial incident between New South Wales and Victoria, by accepting an invitation to cross the colonial border of the Murray River to nearby Moama, to attend a patriotic march. However, crossing the border in uniform and under arms would have legally constituted an \\"invasion\\", and would have been in contravention of the military law of both colonies.. Despite the social context of the event, and the nature of the Rangers' acceptance, the incident upset members of both colonies' governments, who were opposed to either colony allowing troops from the other to enter their territory. The event was defused without incident, but served to highlight how tense the colonies were about defence at the time. Eventually permission was granted for the men to enter New South Wales, and they performed marches and manoeuvres in front of a large reception.. By 1896, Victoria boasted the largest artillery arsenal of all the Australian colonies, possessing nineteen 12-pounder BL guns, six 12-pounder rifled breech loaders (RBLs) and another six 6-pounders of the same type. The Victorian Scottish Regiment was formed in 1898 as a volunteer unit, and by 1901 other infantry units in the Victorian forces consisted of five battalions of militia, as well as the Victorian Rangers and the Victorian Railways Infantry, both of which were volunteer units. Upon the outbreak of the Boer War in South Africa on 12 October 1899, men volunteered for active service from every Australian colony. Victoria's contribution was second only to New South Wales in size,. and comprised 193 officers and 3,372 men of other ranks. The Victorian contingent was involved in a remarkable victory when 50 men from the Victorian Bushmen were involved in the Battle of Elands River in July 1900.. One Victorian, Lieutenant Leslie Maygar, received the Victoria Cross during the conflict. On 31 December 1900, the day before Federation, a survey of the strength of colonial forces found that the Victorian colonial forces consisted of 301 officers and 6,034 other ranks. Shortly after Federation, on 1 March 1901, the units of the Victorian forces were transferred to the Australian Army. =Queensland= The colony of Queensland came into being on 6 June 1859, when it was established as a separate entity from New South Wales. The task of raising a military force for the new colony was commenced shortly after this and the first formation, a troop of mounted rifles, was established in early 1860. Together with a small amount of infantry and artillery, the colony's military forces totalled about 250 men at this time, who were based primarily in Brisbane and Ipswich.. Although they were maintained through the volunteer system, these soldiers were partially paid through a system of subsidies and grants that were provided to enable them to buy the equipment and ammunition required to perform their duties. The Queensland Rifle Association (QRA) was formed on 15 May 1861. Although the Rifle Association was independent of the Queensland Volunteer Force, it was formed largely to hone the marksmanship of the Volunteer Force. The relationship between the Queensland Rifle Association and the military continued for almost a century, being formally dissolved in 1960 when Australian Army funding for competition prizes and ammunition was withdrawn. In 1867, the Spring Hill and Fortitude Valley Volunteer Rifle Corps was raised. Architectural drawing of the Drill Shed, Gympie, 1885 In order to encourage men to serve, land grants of were provided for soldiers who completed five years.. Nevertheless, the colony's military force grew only marginally; by 1876 there were 415 men under arms in the colony's service. These were distributed across two batteries of artillery in Brisbane and Ipswich, some Brisbane-based engineers and six companies of infantry in Brisbane, Ipswich, Warwick, Rockhampton and Toowoomba.. In an effort to rectify the lack of manpower, Queensland passed the Volunteer Act in 1878. Within two years the size of the force had grown to 1,219 men. That same year, 1880, payments to volunteers for attending annual camps were stopped.. British forces had been stationed at Somerset on Cape York between 1865 and 1867 because of the recognised strategic importance of the Torres Strait to the Australian colonies as a whole.. After their withdrawal, Queensland maintained a token force there, but it was widely recognised as inadequate to prevent any serious threat. A fortified coaling station and a more serious force was raised to be stationed upon Thursday Island in 1877. Later, in the early 1890s, more serious moves would be taken to garrison the island as part of a concerted effort by all six colonies to protect a number of strategic points around the Australian continent. Queensland's part in this was to contribute financially, along with Western Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, to the purchase of the three 6-inch guns that were installed on the island, and also to provide the 30-man garrison from their permanent artillery force. Lieutenant Richard Dowse of the Queensland Volunteer Rifles, 1889 Throughout the early 1880s it became apparent that the volunteer system was not effective in meeting the colony's defence needs. As a result, a committee was established to review the situation. The inquiry found that Queensland's military force \\"lacked cohesion and discipline\\", recommending that the force should be maintained through a combination of volunteers and militia. These recommendations were not initially implemented, however, in 1884 a \\"dual system\\" was created when the Volunteer Act was repealed and, under the provisions of the newly enacted Queensland Defence Act, a militia was established into which all males between certain ages became liable to be conscripted if required. This militia, a partially paid force, was established in the metropolitan areas of the colony, while unpaid volunteer units continued to exist in rural areas. A reserve of officers was also created at this time, which could be drawn upon in times of conflict. Three militia infantry units came into being as a result of this development, the Moreton, Wide Bay and Burnett, and Kennedy Regiments; these were supported by three volunteer units, the Queensland Volunteer Rifles, the Queensland Scottish Volunteers and the Queensland Irish Volunteers. Around the same time the Queensland government felt alarmed by the threat of the expansion by the German colony of German New Guinea, and believed that by securing the southeastern quarter of the island of New Guinea, they could provide more safety for shipping through the Torres Strait.. As a result, in April 1883 the colony annexed the Territory of Papua for the British Empire. The British government, opposed to further colonial expansion, initially repudiated the action, but a firmer commitment by the Australian colonial governments eventually led to southern New Guinea (Papua) being declared an official British protectorate on 6 November 1884. In response, Germany annexed the northern portion the following month, expanding Kaiser-Wilhelmsland.. Queensland Defence Forces, Fort Lytton, 1893 That same year Queensland provided for its first permanent forces. These came in the form of a permanent artillery battery, designated 'A' Battery, which was authorised in December 1884 and raised the following March.. That year, 1885, in response to concerns about a possible war with Russia due to tensions between that nation and the British in India, Queensland forces were called up for continuous service over the Easter period, exercising at Fort Lytton.. In 1889, as part of Edwards' review of colonial military forces, the Queensland artillery exercised at Fort Lytton and engineers demonstrated their capability by detonating a number of submarine mines.. Edwards was sufficiently impressed, concluding that the colony's forces were \\"fairly satisfactory\\", although he stopped short of stating that they were efficient. By 1891‚Äì92, the colony's military force consisted of 91 permanent soldiers, 3,133 militia and 841 volunteers.. This progress was lost, however, in the early part of the following decade as the Australian colonies were gripped by an economic depression which had the effect of reducing the amount of money spent on defence.. Although the defence force was mobilised in 1891 to quell a shearers' strike, austerity measures resulted in the cancellation of the annual camp in 1893 and the disbandment of a number of units.. The following year, the permanent artillery, which had been sent to garrison Thursday Island, was reduced, however, by 1895 the situation had improved and defence spending was increased again and Queensland's permanent artillery was again expanded. Recruitment into the foot and mounted infantry increased at this time also.. A survey of field gun holdings in the colony in 1896 showed that there were four 12-pounder BL guns, twelve 9-pounder RMLs and five 12-pounder RBLs.. British and Australian officers, including men from the Queensland Mounted Infantry, in South Africa In July 1899, as tensions between British and Boer settlers in South Africa grew, Queensland pledged a force of 250 men in the event of war... The Boer War subsequently broke out on 11 October 1899 and over the course of the conflict Queensland contributed the third largest force of all the colonies, consisting of 733 troops provided at State expense and 1,419 at Imperial expense, who served in the Queensland Mounted Infantry and Queensland Imperial Bushmen. Following Federation, a further 736 Queenslanders would serve in Commonwealth units. Troops from the Queensland Mounted Infantry were involved in the first significant Australian action of the war when they took part in an attack on a Boer \\"laager\\" at Sunnyside on 1 January 1900,. during which they lost two men killed and two wounded.. On 31 December 1900, the day before Federation, a survey of the strength of colonial forces found that Queensland's colonial forces consisted of 291 officers and 3,737 other ranks. On 1 March 1901, Queensland's military personnel came under the control of the Australian Army. These included three multi-battalion militia infantry regiments and two single-battalion militia infantry regiments, and two volunteer units, the Queensland Rifles and the Queensland Teachers Corps.

Life  Graves was born in Wigton, Cumberland, England, the son of Joseph Graves, a plumber, glazier and ironmonger and his wife Ann, n√©e Matthews. His father died when he was nine years old and he had comparatively little education. At 14 he began to work for an uncle in Cockermouth who was a house, sign, and coach painter, but he learnt little from him. He owed more to an old bachelor, Joseph Falder, a friend of John Dalton the scientist. Graves afterwards said of Falder \\"he fixed in me a love of truth, and bent my purpose to pursue it\\". Graves did some drawing, and at one time wished to study art, but his circumstances did not allow of this, and he became a woollen miller at Caldbeck. There he was friendly with John Peel (1776-1854), with whom he hunted. He was sitting in his parlour one evening with Peel when Graves's little daughter came in and said, \\"Father what do they say to what granny sings?\\" \\"Granny was singing to sleep my eldest son with a very old rant called 'Bonnie (or Cannie) Annie'. The pen and ink being on the table, the idea of writing a song to this old air forced itself upon me, and thus was produced, impromptu, 'D'ye ken John Peel with his coat so grey'. . . . I well remember saying in a joking style, 'By jove, Peel you'll be sung when we're both run to earth'.\\" Graves neglected his woollen mills and lost a court case concerning it. Graves left for Tasmania, and arrived at Hobart in 1833 with his wife and four children, and about ¬£10 in his pocket. Except for a short period at Sydney he remained in Tasmania for the rest of his life. Graves was inventive and \\"brought to considerable perfection several machines--especially one for preparing the New Zealand flax\\". His fortunes varied but he was able to give his children a good education. His eldest son, his namesake, became a well-known Hobart barrister but died before his father, and another son in business in Hobart looked after him in his last days. Graves died at Hobart. He was married twice: firstly to Jane Atkinson and secondly to Abigail Porthouse. There were eight children of the second marriage, of whom at least one son and a daughter survived him. In 1958 a memorial to him was erected in St David's Park. Sidney Gilpin's The Songs and Ballads of Cumberland includes six poems by Graves. For a while he was an inmate in Lachlan Park Hospital (later the Royal Derwent Hospital).

The May Laws had the fullest support of Bismarck, though their actual author was Falk, the Prussian minister of public worship. Preliminary to the May Laws was the abolition of the Catholic department in the ministry of public worship (1871), the placing of the State in exclusive control of education, and the expulsion of the Jesuits from the empire (1873). A year later a like expulsion was decreed against the Redemptorists; Lazarists; Priests of the Holy Ghost, and Nuns of the Sacred Heart as being religious associations allied to the Jesuits. The May Laws proper of 1873 were chiefly as follows: *95.The law of May respected the education and nomination of the clergy. According to this, ecclesiastical positions were open only to native Germans who had been educated at the German gymnasium, who had spent three years pursuing theology at a German university, who had passed the state examination, and who upon presentation by the bishop were accepted by the president of the province. *96.The law of May 12, respected the disciplinary powers of ecclesiastical superiors and established a secular court for deciding ecclesiastical questions, bestowing on it the right, under certain circumstances, of dismissing the clergy from their posts. *97.The law of May 13, restricted the Church's power of punishing. *98.The law of May 14, laid down rules for those who desired to leave the Church, declaring it sufficient for them to manifest their intention before a secular judge. So much at variance with the Constitutions were these laws that the two paragraphs (15,18) guaranteeing the independence and self-government of the Church, had first to be amended (1873) and finally together with another (16) entirely abrogated. Although serious punishments were threatened violators of these laws, the Prussian Episcopate rejected them as a whole. Foremost, they refused to present the government with candidates for nomination, which led to a conflict between Church and State. The bishops, and many of the clergy, were fined or imprisoned‚Äîand some were removed from posts, notably, two archbishops, Ledochowski of Gnesen-Posen and Melchers of Cologne; four bishops, Brinkman of Munster, Blum of Limburg, Forster of Breslau, Martin of Paderborn; one auxiliary bishop, Janiszewski of Posen. Moreover, the May Laws were made more severe. By the military law, the divinity students lost their privilege respecting military service. Salaries due from the state were withheld from episcopal administrators and bishops until they would write their submission to the laws of the state; religious orders were dissolved except for those devoted to the care of the sick (1875). A law was passed enacting that clergy who refused to submit when ejected from office by the secular court might be expelled either from a certain locality or from the empire (1874). The government made great efforts to execute its laws against the Church but it was in vain. Most of the clergy and laity remained loyal to the bishops, and the Center Party under the leadership of Ludwig Windthorst, each year increased its membership in the Imperial Parliament. The May Laws were finally modified by two comprehensive laws (May 21, 1886, and April 29, 1887), which in substance yielded to the Church the control of ecclesiastical education; permitted the reassertion of the papal disciplinary authority over the clergy; allowed the restoration of public worship and the administration of the sacraments; the application of ecclesiastical disciplinary measures; and held out to the religious orders the hope of returning. In 1905 the last remnant of the May Laws disappeared when the anti-Jesuit Law was modified. Background During the Italian unification affecting the Papal State, Pope Pius IX in 1864 had published his Syllabus Errorum of 80 thesis statements denounced as false teaching and the encyclical Quanta cura against freedom of religion and separation of church and state. In summer 1870 the First Vatican Council had affirmed the jurisdictional authority of the Pope and proclaimed his infallibility as a dogma. These developments were suspiciously viewed as \\"ultramontanism\\" by liberal circles in the newly established German Empire, dominated by the mainly Protestant Prussian state, while the forces of political catholicism organised themselves in the Centre Party. Chancellor Otto von Bismarck especially noted their patronage of the Catholic Polish population in the Prussian Province of Posen, in West Prussia and in Upper Silesia as well as of the French in Alsace-Lorraine. In 1871 Bismarck had the Pulpit Law implemented into the German Strafgesetzbuch Penal Code, prohibiting any public statement of priests in political affairs. The Gniezno archbishop Mieczys≈Çaw Halka Led√≥chowski was sentenced to two years in prison for violation. The \\"Jesuits' Law\\" of 1872 banned any branch establishment of the Society of Jesus on the territory of the German Reich. On 11 March 1872, Minister Adalbert Falk by law abolished any Catholic or Protestant administration of schools in Prussia and assigned the supervision solely to the ministry of education. German relations with the Vatican were cut after Pope Pius IX had rejected the ambassador Gustav Adolf Hohenlohe, commented by Bismarck with his \\"We will not walk to Canossa\\" speech in the Reichstag parliament on March 14. Regulation In view of the Catholic resistance, the May Laws of 1873 gave responsibility for the training and appointment of clergy to the state, which resulted in the closing of nearly half of the seminaries in Prussia by 1878. Any cleric had to prove a university education and take a state examination. His appointment was subject to an obligation of disclosure to the Province's Oberpr√§sident (Upper President), who had the power to veto. During the reading in the Prussian Landtag in January, the Progressive deputy Rudolf Virchow had called the bill a Kulturkampf struggle for freedom from the church, a term soon adopted by both sides. The regulations translated into fewer seminarians and more parishes without priests, so that in many places half the parishes stood vacant, leaving hundreds of thousands of Catholics without regular spiritual care. In Trier, Catholics responded to the closing of the seminary by hosting seminarians in their homes and classes were conducted less formally. More commonly, seminarians were sent abroad for training, although such stop-gap measures did not nearly make up for the losses imposed by the May Laws. At the same time a Prussian court for church matters was established. Those bishops acting contrary to the state laws were to be declared deposed. In October 1873 the Mainz bishop and Centre Party founder Wilhelm Emmanuel Freiherr von Ketteler, having publicly condemned the May Laws on a pilgrimage to Kevelaer, was arrested and sentenced to two years in prison, resulting in fierce protests. In March 1874 the Trier bishop Matthias Eberhard was put under arrest and died shortly after he was released from nine months of custody in 1876. Those assisting priests in contravention of the May Laws were subject to fines, arrest and imprisonment, and 210 people were convicted of such crimes in the first four months of 1875. On 13 July 1874 an assault on Bismarck's life by a Catholic journeyman at Bad Kissingen failed. The May Law of 1874 even enabled the state administration to expatriate reluctant clergymen, one year later all congregations were dissolved except for those engaged in nursing. In April 1875 the Prussian Landtag passed the \\"Breadbasket Law\\", divesting clerics of any state support, as long as they did not officially acknowledge the primacy of the German Empire. In January 1876 the Bavarian Pfaelzer Zeitung reported that the Bavarian Minister of War had been admonished to discontinue the exemptions from conscription previously accorded to priests and theological students.\\"The Catholics and the Falk Law - Priests and Theological Students to be Conscripted\\", The New York Times, January 28, 1876 Aftermath The May Laws succeeded in making life harder for the clerics, but the failure of the May Laws to cause the total collapse of Catholic resistance and allow for complete control of the Church by the state is one facet of the broader failure of the Kulturkampf. Bismarck ultimately precipitated the unification of the German Catholics‚Äîdespite the split-off of the Old Catholic Church‚Äîand strengthened their ties with the Roman papacy. In the federal election of 1874, the Catholic Centre Party gained 27.9% of the votes cast, confirming their status as the second strongest parliamentary group in the Reichstag. Furthermore, the chancellor's measures offended several of his Protestant national liberal allies. Bismarck had spotted a new and more serious threat in the rise of the Social Democratic Party, and was aware that he could not go without the Catholics' support to enact his Anti-Socialist Laws. Pope Pius IX died on 7 February 1878, and in the negotiations with his successor Leo XIII the implications of the May Laws were attenuated. Diplomatic relations were resumed in 1882 and the Kulturkampf officially ended by the \\"Peace Laws\\" of 1886/87.

He collected at least 80,000 plant samples while walking across nearly all of the Soviet Union including the most remote regions of Russia and adjacent republics. He traveled in many other countries, including Northern and Central Europe, the United States, India, and China. The establishment of the Herbarium at the Main Botanical Garden in Moscow as a world-class depository with a vast foreign exchange program is largely due to Skvortsov's efforts. He also made additions to the living collection of the Main Botanical Garden. His approach toward botany and evolution inspired him to undertake experimental work in plant introduction. Together with a team of colleagues and students, he successfully worked on domesticating and improving the taste of blue honeysuckles (Lonicera Section Caerulea). He also developed a cultivar of an apricot hardy in Moscow. Skvortsov played a role as a conservation advocate proposing and facilitating the establishment of a new national park in his homeland, Kaluga Oblast and Smolensk Oblast of Central European Russia. He cared about the natural heritage of his country, but also about preservation of the Russian language. He spoke out for high language standards in scientific publications. A.K.

Biography Pierre Moerlen was born in Colmar (Haut-Rhin) on 23 October 1952, third of five children. His father was an organist and his mother was a music teacher. All five siblings learned music with their parents and all became musicians. Pierre's younger brother, Beno√Æt Moerlen, is also a percussionist (he also worked with Gong and Mike Oldfield). Pierre left Colmar for Strasbourg to learn percussion with Jean Batigne, founder of Les Percussions de Strasbourg. He was also a member of two rock and rock-jazz bands, including Hasm Cong√©lateur (with included future Magma guitarist Gabriel Federow), whose most notable performance was the opening slot at the Seloncourt Festival in September 1972, headlined by Ange, Genesis and Robert Wyatt's Matching Mole. In January 1973, Moerlen joined Daevid Allen's Gong, debuting on the Angel's Egg (1973) album. In June 1973 he was asked by Virgin Records's boss Richard Branson to play percussion with Mike Oldfield for the premiere of Tubular Bells (1973), to replace the incapacitated Robert Wyatt. Steve Hillage, guitar player of Gong, also took part. Between 1975-87, beginning with Ommadawn (1975), Moerlen would be Oldfield's percussionist of choice for his albums and his tours. Moerlen left and returned to Gong several times to tour with Les Percussions de Strasbourg (he created with them Musik im Bauch by Karlheinz Stockhausen and Hi√©rophonie V by Yoshihisa Ta√Øra at Festival international d'art contemporain de Royan, 1975), and although he recorded You (1974) he left just before the tour promoting that album began. In the summer of 1975, by which time band founder, Daevid Allen, had left, he was asked to return to co-lead the band with Didier Malherbe and Steve Hillage, who himself left shortly thereafter, only appearing on a couple of tracks on the next album Shamal (1976). Another series of line-up changes resulted in the Gazeuse! (1976) album (released as Expresso in the US) with Allan Holdsworth on guitar, following which Malherbe left, leaving Moerlen as the only link with the \\"classic\\" Gong line-up. He retained the name for the next album, Expresso II (1978), but to avoid confusion the band's concerts were often announced as Gong-Expresso. Since this wasn't clear enough, the name Pierre Moerlen's Gong (PMG) was used from 1978 onwards. At this point the band ‚Äì which included American musicians Bon Lozaga (guitar) and Hansford Rowe (bass) ‚Äì were playing jazz fusion rather than the Canterbury scene-influenced psychedelia of old. In 1978, PMG were released from the Virgin contract, and signed with Arista, releasing Downwind (1979), Time is the Key (1979), Pierre Moerlen's Gong Live (1980) and Leave It Open (1980). During this period, Moerlen regularly toured internationally with Mike Oldfield. PMG ceased operations in 1981 following tours of North America and Europe in late 1980. Later that year, Moerlen briefly joined Magma as second drummer. Following Mike Oldfield's 10th Anniversary tour in 1983, he joined the Swedish progressive/symphonic band Tribute (1985‚Äì87). PMG reformed for two albums and tours in the late 1980s. After spending several years as orchestra pit musician for various musicals, he returned to active service in 1997 when he joined the British jazz-rock outfit Brand X for international touring in 1997. Later that year, he was asked to rejoin Gong, and toured with the band until 1999. He then concentrated on putting together a new PMG line-up and repertoire, which resulted in the live album Pentanine (2004), recorded in Moscow in 2002. Death Pierre Moerlen died unexpectedly on 3 May 2005, aged 52, of natural causes. At the time of his death he was rehearsing with a new incarnation of Pierre Moerlen's Gong.

It was originally released for MS-DOS, then IBM OS/2 and Microsoft Windows. The Brief interface and functionality live on, including via the SourceForge GRIEF editor. History Brief was designed and developed by UnderWare Inc, a company founded in Providence, Rhode Island by David Nanian and Michael Strickman, and was published by Solution Systems. UnderWare moved to Boston, Massachusetts in 1985. Solution Systems released version 2.1 in 1988. In 1990, UnderWare sold Brief to Solution Systems, which released version 3.1. Solution Systems advertised the $195 Brief as a \\"Program Editing Breakthrough! / Get 20% More Done\\". In 1990 Solutions Systems brought in Eric Perkins as technical architect and team lead to port the OS/2 version of Brief to the Windows platform as quickly as possible. The end result was to sell the Solution System assets to the highest bidder. Within 6 months, the team of Eric Perkins, Blake Nelson and Jeff Simpson worked closely with David Nanian and Mike Strickman and ported Brief OS/2 to Windows using an MVC architecture. It was this version that was demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1991 to Borland and others, with Borland later purchasing Brief and the full suite of software tools from Solutions Systems. Solution Systems closed permanently after the sale to Borland. Brief is no longer sold by Borland.

Description The foundation stone was laid in 1571 according to the plan and guidance of Girolamo Cassar, architect of the Knights of St John. The church was rebuilt in 1765 according to a plan of Giuseppe Bonici. It was elevated to a parish church in 1968. St Augustine Hall, adjacent to the church, is part of the original plan of Cassar. The present church was consecrated by Giovanni Maria Camilleri on 1 July 1906. A number of the artefacts found inside the church are originals from the first church. One of these is an important sixteenth-century painting of the Augustinian Nicholas of Tolentino depicted by the famous artist Mattia Preti. This is found in the chapel of the same saint. In the first chapel to the left, there is a painting of the Augustinian John of Sahagun who was born in Spain in 1430. It is from the school of Preti and some of its figures can be found depicted on the ceiling of St John's Co-Cathedral in Valletta. Beneath it there is a small painting of Our Lady of Grace, undated and unsigned, also from the first church. The church is renowned for the statue of St. Rita.

It was a single-engine, two-seat biplane with twin main floats and backward-folding wings. The Campania was the first aeroplane ever designed specifically for carrier operations. Development The Royal Navy was an early leader in carrier aviation and in the autumn of 1914, purchased the liner for conversion into a seaplane carrier. Operating seaplanes required the carrier to stop to hoist the aircraft out- and in-board by crane, leaving the ship exceedingly vulnerable to U-Boat attacks and the Admiralty began to seek alternatives.Taylor 1988, p.56 By the middle of 1916, Campania had been fitted with a flight deck forward on which, experiments were being carried out in launching aircraft. The Admiralty issued a specification for a purpose-built, two-seat patrol and reconnaissance aircraft. Fairey Aviation designed a single-engined tractor biplane of fabric-covered wooden construction, which first flew on 16 February 1917. The two-bay wings folded rearwards for storage, the crew of two sat in separate cockpits, the observer being provided with a Lewis gun on a Scarff ring.Bruce 1963, pp. 142‚Äì143. The first of two prototypes, F.16, was powered by a 250 hp (190 kW) Rolls-Royce Eagle IV and the second prototype, powered by an Eagle V of 275 hp (205 kW), was named F.17. Both prototypes were later flown operationally from Scapa Flow. Operational history Trials proving satisfactory, the type went into production and service. Most of the F.17s shipped aboard the carriers HMS Campania, and ; the first aircraft joined Campania and the type took its name from her. Only Campania possessed a flight deck; Campanias operated from this using jettisonable, wheeled bogies fitted to the floats. The aircraft in the other ships took off from the water in the normal way. The 27 F.22s operated from Royal Naval Air Service air stations. The Campania had an undistinguished career, but performed useful work as a spotter aeroplane.In all, 170 aircraft were ordered, but only 62 were completed. On 1 August 1918, during the North Russia Campaign in support of the British intervention in the Russian Civil War, Campanias from Nairana participated in what was probably the first fully combined air, sea, and land military operation in history, joining Allied ground forces and ships in driving Bolsheviks out of their fortifications on Modyugski Island at the mouth of the Northern Dvina River in Russia, then scouting ahead of the Allied force as it proceeded up the channel to Arkhangelsk. The appearance of one of the Campanias over Arkhangelsk induced the Bolshevik leaders there to panic and flee.Dobson, Christopher, and John Miller, The Day They Almost Bombed Moscow: The Allied War in Russia, 1918‚Äì1920, New York: Atheneum, 1986, no ISBN number, pp. 63‚Äì64.

Just after the close of Yom Kippur between 5‚Äì6 October 1946, the group moved to their current location next to kibbutz Gat in the Shephelah as one of the 11 points of settlement established in the area that night. The kibbutz was established with the help of funding from Keren Hayesod on land purchased by the Jewish National Fund. =Early statehood= Cows raised at Gal On During the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the kibbutz was isolated and attacked by the Egyptian Army. Egyptian troops advanced within a kilometer of Gal On, but efforts by kibbutz members to lay minefields helped defend the kibbutz and maintain Israel's southern front during the war. In late October 1948, the kibbutz served as a base for the Israel Defense Forces' Operation Yoav as it was attacked by Arab forces, resulting in the capture of Beit Jibrin in the east. In 1949, kibbutz Beit Guvrin was established nearby. The kibbutz's population was boosted by a group of Holocaust survivors who had arrived on the refugee ship Exodus in 1947. In 1951, a large group of Hashomer Hatzair members arrived from North America. A group of Israeli Hashomer Hatzair members joined ten years later in 1961. Additionally, the kibbutz also absorbed a small group of members of Mapam from Uruguay. =2000‚Äìpresent= In the year 2000, the kibbutz faced economic hardships: The kibbutz was losing money, and kibbutz children were leaving for the cities. Consequently, Gal On members decided to change its ways. Kibbutz members decided to adopt a new ‚Äúsecurity net.‚Äù This stabilized the economic situation, but had little effect on demographics. Although more kibbutz children are staying to live on the kibbutz, few become kibbutz members. Their economic situation was exacerbated by a critical lack of water. Gal On had considerably large tracts of land that could not be cultivated because of the shortage. The kibbutz had a well that supplied 60,000 cubic meters of water a year ‚Äì almost all of which was used for drinking water and daily needs. Only when the Israeli National Water Carrier was completed was it possible to expand the cultivated areas. Industry and agriculture Bedouins place dead hawks in the fields for good luck A factory was established in the first days of the kibbutz, which was, at the time, the first factory in the country that produced steel tools using modern methods. After many years, the factory was shut down and a box factory was established in its place, but it too eventually closed. Years later, the kibbutz bought a fan factory that was for sale in Ramla. This factory played an important role in the kibbutz economy for many years, until the fan market was inundated by cheap Chinese fans. The factory was converted to electrical motor production, but it too succumbed to the Chinese market and closed down. Today, the kibbutz survives mainly on income from agriculture and the salaries of kibbutz members working outside the kibbutz. Primary crops include wheat, watermelons, and sunflowers. The kibbutz also raises cows and chickens. In addition, the kibbutz's guest house is a significant source of income.

It is based in the town of Mersch, about 15 kilometers to the north of Luxembourg City. Created as a research library in 1995, the CNL's collections include more than 40,000 volumes, a majority of them written by authors of Luxembourgish descent or residing in Luxembourg, as well as an ever-growing collection of manuscripts, letters and personal items.Pierre MARSON: Die Best√§nde des Luxemburger Literaturarchivs. Mersch/Luxembourg: Centre national de litt√©rature. 2005 The library also collects newspaper clippings relating to Luxembourgish literature and literary journals and serials. As one of Luxembourg's legal deposit libraries, it receives copies of nearly all books produced in Luxembourg and actively purchases monographs by Luxembourgish authors printed abroad. Historical background In 1995, the CNL was created as a part of the Luxembourg national archives.Cornel MEDER: Das Luxemburger Literaturarchiv. Eine Chronik der Vorgeschichte. Mersch: Centre national de litt√©rature. 1995 The idea was to assemble all documents relating to the literary life in Luxembourg, both contemporary and historical, in a single place and thus to create a focal point for literary researchers. In addition to encouraging and facilitating research, the CNL also promotes contemporary literary output, by organising exhibitions, conferences, reading sessions and various events relating to literature in Luxembourg. Since 2005, the CNL is a fully-fledged independent cultural institute. The literary center is housed in the Maison Servais, a large 17th-century mansion which once belonged to the Luxembourgish politician Emmanuel Servais.Centre national de litt√©rature Mersch/L√´tzebuerger Literaturarchiv. [texts: Alain LEER, Cornel MEDER and Manou SERVAIS]. Mersch: Centre national de litt√©rature. 1995. The last inhabitant of the mansion, Jeanne Servais, donated the house to the town of Mersch. The premises were then handed over to the State of Luxembourg, who renovated the house and installed the Centre national de litt√©rature in it. The main building now houses five exhibition rooms, the library, a reading room, researchers' and administrative offices and two conference rooms. A newly erected second building houses the literary caf√©, which is used for various literary get-togethers. Both buildings are flanked by a public park. The CNL's premises are currently undergoing extension. In early 2008, the adjacent building, which is now being renovated, will house a part of the archives' storage and office facilities. Access to the collections The CNL's collections can be consulted by researchers and students as well as interested members of the public. It is however not a general public library, but rather a research library specializing in Luxemburgensia. A range of Luxembourgish newspapers and reference works such as dictionaries and encyclopedias can be freely accessed in the reading room. The library's catalogue can be consulted on the Luxembourg National Library's integrated catalogue, which is based on the commercial Integrated Library System Aleph. The library also offers other specialised catalogues and research services. Exhibitions The CNL regularly organises exhibitions which often display manuscripts or other precious items from the archives' funds to the general public. The exhibitions deal with Luxembourgish literary life in the broadest sense, and often highlight cultural exchanges between Luxembourgish and German or French authors.[Ed.]: Centre national de litt√©rature: 10 Joer CNL: 1995 - 2005.

It regularly publishes exhibition catalogues, essays on Luxembourgish literature and scholarly re-editions of important works by Luxembourgish authors.

Two of his sons (Publius Cornelius Scipio and Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus) and three of his grandsons (Scipio Africanus, Scipio Asiaticus and Scipio Nasica) also became famous Roman generals and consuls; his most famous descendant being Scipio Africanus. As consul in 259 BC, he led the Roman fleet in the capture of Aleria and then Corsica, but failed against Olbia in Sardinia. The Fasti Triumphales record that he was awarded a triumph, but two other inscriptions on his career do not mention it. The following year he was elected censor with Gaius Duilius.

Bulger (1789‚Äì1858) was a soldier and colonial administrator, born at St John's in the Crown Colony of Newfoundland. In 1804 he joined the Royal Newfoundland Fencibles as an Ensign, and within two years received his commission as a Lieutenant. On the outbreak of the War of 1812, a substantial detachment from the regiment was sent to Upper Canada to serve as marines on armed vessels on the Great Lakes. With this contingent, Bulger saw action at the Battle of Detroit and Battle of Stoney Creek, and on the Saint Lawrence, as well as at the Battle of Crysler's Farm. Late in 1813, he was appointed Adjutant to Lieutenant Colonel Robert McDouall, newly appointed commander of the post at Fort Mackinac. Leading a party of the Royal Newfoundlanders, he was slightly wounded in the Engagement on Lake Huron in which two American gunboats were captured, saving the British post from blockade and starvation. He was subsequently appointed to command the post at Fort McKay, at Prairie du Chien in Wisconsin. He faced a hard winter, in which he had to contend with lack of supplies, mutinous troops, difficulties with Indian allies and a quarrel with the Indian Department representative, Robert Dickson. He nevertheless remained in charge until news arrived of the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the war. Red River in a horse cariole with Fort Garry in the background (1822-23) It is notable that Bulger was the only British officer in the course of the 1812-1815 conflict who entered the war as a lieutenant, and retained that rank for the duration. Nearly 70 other officers were promoted over him during that time. At Fort McKay he was given jurisdiction with the local rank of captain, however he never received the full captaincy for which he had been recommended. Although his several post-war applications for a military appointment and remuneration for his services during the war were always fully supported by senior British officers, it was not until 1820 that he finally succeeded in obtaining a compensation of ¬£500 and military allowance equal to the half-pay of a captain. In 1821, on the recommendation of Gordon Drummond, temporarily Governor General of Canada, Bulger was appointed Secretary for the Red River Settlement in Rupert's Land, taking up the post in 1822. He quickly found the situation there unappealing. He quarrelled with the local representatives of the Hudson's Bay Company, who monopolised the fur trade and supplies in the colony. Eventually his stand was vindicated. Bulger left the Red River colony in 1823, in poor health. He subsequently served for many years as clerk to the office of Military Secretary in Quebec City and later in Montreal. In 1834 at Quebec City he married Alicia May Lowther, which whom he had eight children. Bulger died at Montreal in 1858 and was buried in the old Anglican cemetery.

Licinius Crassus is mentioned several times (sometimes as Licinius Crassus or as Publius Crassus) in Livy's Histories. He is first mentioned in connection with his surprising election as Pontifex Maximus, and then several times since in various other capacities. Publius Licinius Crassus, otherwise called Licinius Crassus or Licinius in Livy's Histories, was a handsome, amiable man of a distinguished plebeian family, who rose relatively young to the position of Pontifex Maximus (chief priest of Rome) before he had been elected curule aedile. Licinius Crassus, known also as Publius Licinius Crassus Dives (for his great wealth), was the direct patrilineal ancestor of two consuls and censors - Publius Licinius Crassus (consul 97 BC) (censor in 89 BC who was killed or died in December 87 BC) and his son Marcus Licinius Crassus the triumvir (consul 70 and 55 BC, censor 65 BC, who was killed in 53 BC in a disastrous war against the Parthians). Family background Publius Licinius Crassus was the son of Publius Licinius Varus, whose ancestry is unknown. It is possible that he was related to the consul Gaius Licinius Varus (consul in 236 BC) whose grandson was Publius Licinius Crassus (consul 171 BC) and whose great-grandson was Publius Licinius Crassus Mucianus, also consul and Pontifex Maximus. The connections between these Licinii and the earliest mentioned plebeian consul Licinius and the more famous Gaius Licinius Stolo are not clear. Licinius Crassus is later described as \\"Dives\\" (or rich, an additional cognomen) indicating that he was particularly wealthy among Romans of his day (the family tradition of wealth continued, with several of his descendants, notably the triumvir Marcus Licinius Crassus, being nicknamed \\"Dives\\" as well). Nothing is known of Licinius Crassus's mother or his childhood or early youth, or for that matter, his year of birth. He was probably born during the First Punic War (ca. 250-245 BC), and educated and trained much like noble Romans of his day. Career as priest He is first mentioned by Livy in his Histories in connection with the death of the Pontifex Maximus Lentulus in 213 BC. In the election for Pontifex Maximus, two censors, the patrician Titus Manlius Torquatus and the plebeian Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, were suddenly joined by Licinius Crassus, who was then standing for election as curule aedile. Presumably, by then, he was already a pontiff or priest to be eligible for election, since Livy does not mention otherwise. Surprisingly, the two eminent censors were defeated by a younger virtually unknown man. Livy does not mention the details of this election but later mentions that Licinius Crassus was handsome, amiable, rich, and well-connected. All of them might have helped him win popular support; it is also possible that the two eminent senior candidates cancelled each other's votes out, thus allowing the unknown third candidate to slip through. Licinius Crassus is described as being well-versed in pontifical law; he is shown by Livy as reminding Romans of their religious duties repeatedly (particularly after the conclusion of the Second Punic War). As Pontifex Maximus and as consul, he also reminded the elderly Princeps Senatus Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus in 205 BC during a debate that he (Licinius) could not leave Italy, but his co-consul Scipio suffered no such religious disability. Political career His early political career is not known. However, like his future political ally Scipio (and a few other young Roman aristocrats of the same era such as Publius Sempronius Tuditanus), Licinius Crassus was elected young to important positions, being chosen to certain positions over those of greater age and seniority in the political arena. He was known for his learning in pontifical law, his great bodily strength, and his military skills (although he never won a triumph). Licinius Crassus is perhaps best known for his refusal to leave Italy, as Fabius wanted, which allowed his co-consul Scipio to take Sicily as his province and eventually invade Africa. Licinius Crassus was elected to the following positions: *Pontifex Maximus ca. 212 BC (held that position until his death in 183 BC) *curule aedile ca. 212/211 BC *censor in 210 BC, resigned without starting the lustrum, when his colleague died immediately *Master of the Horse (Magister equitum) to the dictator Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, proconsul and former consul and censor (and his unsuccessful rival in the pontifical election) in 210/209 BC *Praetor in 208 BC, elected the same year as Publius Licinius Varus (possibly son of the consul Gaius Licinius Varus). *Consul in 205 BC, elected along with his political ally Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus During his consulship, Licinius Crassus remained in Bruttium, prosecuting the war against Hannibal, by then penned up in that corner of Italy. He was ill at the end of his year and so requested that a dictator be appointed to conduct elections since neither consul was able to be present. Licinius Crassus was appointed proconsul for the following year by the Senate. He was presumably relieved of his duties in 203 BC, when Hannibal evacuated all his troops back home. Family and descendants Licinius Crassus's wife is unknown, but he had a son living at his death, also named Publius Licinius Crassus, who organized magnificent funeral games in 183 BC. This son was paternal great-grandfather of the future triumvir Marcus Licinius Crassus. Descendants of Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Pontifex Maximus include: : Publius Licinius Crassus, fl. 183 BC, son of the Pontifex Maximus; who was father of :: Marcus Licinius Crassus Agestalus ::: Marcus Licinius Crassus, praetor 107 BC ::: Publius Licinius Crassus (consul 97 BC), censor 89 BC (killed/died 87 BC) :::: Publius Licinius Crassus (killed ca. 90 BC in the Social War) :::: Lucius Licinius Crassus (killed 87 BC) ::::Marcus Licinius Crassus, triumvir (ca. 115 BC - 53 BC, killed by Parthians) :::: ::::: Publius Licinius Crassus (killed, or died by suicide 53 BC in war against Parthians) md 56/55 BC Cornelia Metella (herself great-granddaughter of Lucius Licinius Crassus), no issue. ::::: Marcus Licinius Crassus, quaestor to Julius Caesar; he married Caecilia Metella Cretica, whose tomb is still visible on the Appian Way.

The attack killed seven and wounded over 200 Croatian civilians and was carried out on 2 May and 3 May 1995 as retaliation for the Croatian army's offensive in Operation Flash. The rocket attacks deliberately targeted civilian locations. Zagreb was the largest of several cities hit by the attack. It was the only instance in the entire war in Croatia that cluster bombs were used in combat. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) characterized the attack as a crime against humanity and convicted Croatian Serb leader Milan Martiƒá of ordering the attack. Introduction During the early part of the war, the Croatian capital Zagreb was spared from devastation, as it was far from the frontlines. Serb General Milan ƒåeleketiƒá announced to the press on 24 March 1995, more than a month prior to the attack, that should a Croatian offensive be launched, he expected to respond by targeting the \\"weak points,\\" that is, \\"the parks of the Croatian cities\\" and added: \\"We know who the people in the parks are; civilians.\\" In May 1995 Croatia launched Operation Flash, which recaptured the area of western Slavonia (UNPA sector West) that had been under Serb control since 1991. In neighboring Bosnia, the leader of the Republika Srpska, Radovan Karad≈æiƒá, threatened to send help to the Serbs in Croatia. Following the rapid collapse of the Serb defence in the area, Serb leader Milan Martiƒá ordered Serb rocket artillery units in the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina to fire missiles on the capital of Zagreb. Karlovac and Sisak were also subjected to retaliatory attacks. The Yugoslav-produced Orkan 262 mm Multiple rocket launchers (MRL) fires M-87 non-guided missiles. The ones fired against Zagreb were armed with aviation cluster bomb warheads (called cassette bombs or Jinglebell), each of which contains 288 \\"bomblets\\" (smaller ammunition) which are ejected at a height of 1,000 meters above the target area. Upon impact, each bomblet explodes and releases 420 pellets, the lethal range of each of which is ten meters. This means that each rocket releases around 120,000 of these pellets, which have been characterized as designed specifically to kill or maim local infantry.  Strikes  Ribnjak Street On 1 May, a meeting was held between leaders of the RSK. Although negotiations were on-going, Martiƒá and ƒåeleketiƒá were not in favor of a peaceful solution. At 1 pm on 1 May, Milan ƒåeleketiƒá ordered, with Martiƒá present, an artillery barrage on Sisak which was opened at 5 pm that day. On the same day, an M-87 Orkan rocket artillery unit from Knin was redeployed to Vojniƒá (about 50 km south of Zagreb). The first attack occurred on 2 May, at 10:25 in the morning. At the time, many civilians were in the streets. The targets hit included the Strossmayer promenade, Petrinjska street and Vla≈°ka street where a tram full of passengers was hit. The Classical Gymnasium in Zagreb located in the city centre was also hit, as were Pleso and its airport. In total, five civilians were killed and 146 injured. The second attack occurred the following day, at 12:10 in the afternoon. The children's hospital in Klaiƒáeva street, the Croatian National Theatre building (which housed Russian, Ukrainian and British ballet dancers at the time, some of whom were wounded) and the Courthouse at Nikola ≈†ubiƒá Zrinski Square were among those hit. Two civilians were killed that day and 48 injured, which were less than the day before due to many people avoiding public areas following the first attack. Most of the missiles targeted the city center and surrounding streets, which were most likely to be filled with civilians in the morning. In total, seven people were killed and about 200 injured (of which about 100 seriously) from these attacks. Aftermath A plaque commemorating victims of the rocket attack On 3 May, Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, President of Serbia at the time, instructed Yugoslav Army Chief of the General Staff Momƒçilo Peri≈°iƒá to call ƒåeleketiƒá and forbid further strikes against Zagreb. After 4 May and the end of Operation Flash, United Nations Special Envoy Yasushi Akashi met with Martiƒá and condemned him for the attack. Martiƒá then threatened to resume the attacks and spoke of \\"massive rocket attacks on Zagreb which would leave 100,000 people dead.\\" On October 10, 2013, a cluster bomb which failed to detonate was discovered on the roof of the Klaiƒáeva children's hospital, 18 years after the attacks. After surgery on several patients had been completed, the Zagreb police bomb disposal squad was given clearance to detonate the ordnance. No one was injured in the detonation. In May 2013, city mayor Milan Bandiƒá opened a museum in Petriƒáeva St. dedicated to the tragedy. War crimes charges by the ICTY Immediately following the attacks, Martiƒá appeared on Serb television and publicly boasted about ordering the attacks. This video was later used against him during his trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) after he was indicted for war crimes. The attack on Zagreb was one of the main points of the indictment against him, to which he confessed, but claimed it was a \\"legitimate action against the enemy\\". On June 12, 2007, he was sentenced to 35 years in prison. Peri≈°iƒá, was also indicted for his role in the rocket attack. He was sentenced to 27 years in prison because the judges ruled that he had effective control over the SVK commanders since he issued orders to them and initiated disciplinary proceedings against them; therefore he was responsible for the failure to punish those who launched the rockets on Zagreb. In February 2013, Peri≈°iƒá was acquitted on all counts and released upon appealing his conviction.

Early years and Dundee United Irvine was raised in West Lothian, where he attended St Mary's School in Bathgate. He showed early footballing promise and was capped by Scotland at Schoolboy level. He started his senior football career with Dundee United, then in the Second Division, initially on a part-time basis as he completed a motor mechanic apprenticeship. In 1959 United manager Andy McCall (their fifth in less than five years), resigned after leading the part-time club to third bottom place in Division Two. Jerry Kerr was given the task of reviving the club in April that year. Kerr gave Irvine his chance as well as Dennis Gillespie who Kerr brought from Alloa Athletic. Kerr's first policy upon joining United was his insistence that his players be full-time, a gamble that could have cost the club dearly. He also insisted that there had to be a properly constituted reserve side and an end to the previous policy of buying in over-the-hill First Division players. Yeats' career took an upward turn from Kerr's appointment. Kerr regarded Yeats as so vital to the fortunes of the team he sought his release to play each Saturday from the military authorities while Yeats served his National Service. In Kerr's 1959‚Äì60 first full season in charge, St Johnstone finished as champions. United's challengers for the second promotion spot were Hamilton Academical and Queen of the South. Hamilton were beaten 5-1 at Tannadice with seven games to go before a crowd of over 11,000 putting Accies firmly in United's rear view. United went to Palmerston Park to play the Ivor Broadis inspired Queen of the South with three games to go. United returned home with a 4-4 draw to maintain their one- point advantage over QoS. Promotion was clinched with a last game of the season 1-0 home win against Berwick Rangers before a crowd of near 17,000.\\"Results for Dundee United for 1959-60\\" London Hearts This brought First Division football to Tannadice for the first time since they had been relegated in 1932. In the following 1960‚Äì61 season United retained their top division place. Other players to flourish like defensive giant Ron Yeats were the forward pair Gillespie and Irvine scoring 21 and 23 goals respectively. United finished a creditable ninth. Irvine's striking partnership with Gillespie provided more than 150 goals as they consolidated a position in the Scottish top flight over the following seasons. In 1961 his goalscoring attracted the attention of Bill Shankly who was desperate to sign a striker but injury at a crucial time put paid to any transfer and Shankly instead bought Ian St John from Motherwell. Middlesbrough At the end of the 1963-64 season, Middlesbrough manager Raich Carter bid ¬£25,000 for Irvine's services and he moved to Teesside. Boro were a mid-table Division Two at the time but despite Irvine becoming a regular goalscorer, they slumped to relegation in 1965-66. An instant return to Division Two was secured the following season, although QPR won the league title. A bust-up with then manager Stan Anderson over him being rushed back too soon after injury (including an appearance in a specially arranged friendly for Irvine's benefit against Brian Clough's Hartlepool United at Hutton Road, Middlesbrough's training ground) led Irvine to return to Scotland in 1967. Heart of Midlothian Irvine joined John Harvey's Heart of Midlothian for ¬£10,000. A coachload of Middlesbrough FC Jim Irvine fans went to Hearts to see his debut for the Edinburgh side. He appeared in his first major final in his first season with the Maroons, after playing in every match en route to the 1967-68 Scottish Cup final. However, George Farm's Dunfermline proved too strong in the Hampden showpiece, winning 3-1. His following two seasons were decimated by a series of injuries and he was released in 1970. Barrow He joined Division Four Barrow but left senior football when they were voted out of the Football League in 1972. Irvine next went to New Blackburn Athletic. After playing After his playing retirement he returned to Bathgate, where he found work as a spray-painter. His son Alan Irvine played professionally for many clubs including Falkirk, Liverpool, Dundee United, Shrewsbury Town and St Mirren in the 1980s and 90s.

It was most likely painted by Gianfrancesco Penni or Giulio Romano, somewhere between 1520 and 1524. After the master's death in 1520, they worked together with other members of Raphael's workshop to finish the commission to decorate with frescoes the rooms that are now known as the Stanze di Raffaello, in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican. The Donation of Constantine is located in the Sala di Costantino (\\"Hall of Constantine\\"). It was inspired by the famous forged documents that supposedly granted the Popes sovereignty over Rome's territorial dominions. The painting depicts an apocryphal historical event: Emperor Constantine kneels before Pope Sylvester I and offers the Pope and his successors control of the city of Rome and the entire Western Roman Empire. The depiction of Sylvester is modeled after Pope Clement VII who became pope in 1523. The painting (anachronistically) shows the interior of the original Saint Peter's Basilica, which was in the process of being rebuilt at the time the painting was made.

It is the congregation's fourth sanctuary. The congregation, dating back to 1819, was the first Unitarian Universalist congregation in the city. It has provided a pulpit for some of the movement's leading theologians and has also recorded many eminent persons in its membership. History All Souls was the first Unitarian congregation to be organized in New York and originated in 1819 when Lucy Channing Russell invited forty friends and neighbors into her Lower Manhattan home, to listen to an address by her brother, William Ellery Channing, the minister of the Federal Street Church in Boston. Channing was making a stop in New York while traveling to Baltimore to preach the famous sermon in which he would articulate the distinctive tenets of Unitarian Christianity, the most salient of which were the rejection of the Trinity in favor of absolute Monotheism, and the imperative to interpret the Bible through reason. In New York, the enthusiasm aroused by Channing culminated in the formation of the First Congregational Church (Unitarian), which proceeded to erect its first building in 1820-21, on Chambers Street between Church Street and Chapel Street, before it had even found a minister. The task of recruitment was difficult since few ministers could be persuaded to venture away from the stability of the Unitarian heartland in New England and risk their careers in new congregations beyond. Finally, on December 18, 1821, William Ware was installed as the first minister. 391 4th Ave, \\"Holy Zebra\\" In 1845, the congregation moved to a new building at 548 Broadway and renamed itself the Church of the Divine Unity the following year. In 1855, the present name, All Souls, was taken by an American church for the first time when the congregation dedicated its third building, at 249 Fourth Avenue (now Park Avenue South) at 20th Street. The new church was designed by Jacob Wrey Mould and featured bands of red and white bricks and Caen stone, which led to the colloquial names of \\"The Holy Zebra\\" and \\"The Beefsteak Church.\\" In partnership with minister Henry Whitney Bellows, who served for over four decades from 1839 to 1882, All Souls grew to include some of the leading social reformers and cultural figures of the city, such as Peter Cooper, Herman Melville, and others. One noted member was the novelist Catharine Sedgwick, who remarked upon the diverse backgrounds of the people who were attracted to the freedom of ethical inquiry which All Souls offered: \\"strangers from inland and outland, English radicals and daughters of Erin, Germans and Hollanders, philosophic gentiles and unbelieving Jews . . . In this, our ass'n, there is at least one of every sort.\\" In evolving from its roots in Unitarian Christianity, All Souls has embraced an enlarging religious pluralism that continues to this day. All Souls relocated to its current building on the Upper East Side at 1157 Lexington Avenue at 80th Street in 1932, designed by Richard Upjohn's grandson, Herbert Upjohn, in the Colonial Revival style with a Regency-influenced base. Forrest Church, the prolific author and theologian, then served as Senior Minister for almost thirty years until the beginning of 2007, when, due to terminal cancer, he was succeeded by Galen Guengerich and assumed the less strenuous duties of Minister of Public Theology.

It was gutted by fire in 1834, and has been described as \\"perhaps the greatest artistic treasure lost in the fire\\".The Fire of 1834 and the Old Palace of Westminster, parliament.uk The room was re-roofed and re-furnished to be used temporarily by the House of Lords until 1847, and it was demolished in 1851. The chamber was built by Henry III, parallel to St Stephen's Chapel. It is said that the site was previously occupied by a room in which Edward the Confessor had died.Henry III and the Painted Chamber, parliament.uk The new chamber was intended for use by the king primarily as a private apartment, but was also used as a reception room, and it was constructed and decorated to impress visitors. The chamber was relatively long and narrow, measuring approximately , with a state bed (for example the marriage bed of Henry VII) towards one end under a painting of Edward the Confessor. One wall included a squint providing a view of the altar in a chapel next door, so the king could view religious services from the chamber. The ceiling of wooden planks with decorative bosses survived until at least 1819, when it was replaced with plaster. Plan of the Palace of Westminster in 1834, showing the position of the Painted Chamber, parallel to the House of Commons in St Stephen's Chapel to the north, and at right angles to the south end of the House of Lords in the White Chamber to the west. Mural of the coronation of Edward the Confessor, Charles Stothard 1819 The chamber was originally named the King's Chamber. It adjoined a new Queen's Chamber to the south, later used for meetings of the House of Lords until it moved to the Lesser Hall or White Chamber in 1801; the Queen's Chamber was demolished along with other buildings in 1823.The Day Parliament Burned Down, Caroline Shenton, p.9-10 The King's Chamber came to be known as the Painted Chamber after its decorative wall paintings, of Virtues and Vices, and Bible figures. The brightly coloured paintings took 60 years to complete, starting in 1226. The original paintings were repaired in 1263 after they were damaged by fire, and again in 1267 after they were damaged by a mob that invaded the palace. The murals were supplemented by paintings commissioned by subsequent monarchs. The Painted Chamber was later neglected, and the walls were whitewashed, papered and covered by tapestries as depicted in the watercolour of William Capon from 1799. In 1800 the original murals were detected under the whitewash, but it was only in 1819 that they were fully revealed. In that year the Society of Antiquarians commissioned the artist and antiquarian Charles Stothard to make watercolour copies of the murals; and Thomas Crofton Croker, clerk of works at Westminster and an amateur artist, made his own somewhat more complete copies in watercolour, now held by the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Ashmolean Museum. During repairs in 1816, four ceiling paintings‚Äîone seraph and three prophets painted on oak panels‚Äîwere removed by Adam Lee, the \\"Labourer in Trust\\" at Westminster. After passing through several owners, two of them (the seraph and a prophet) resurfaced in Bristol in 1993 and were acquired by the British Museum two years later. The whereabouts of the other two are not known. A wooden patera from the original ceiling is preserved in the Museum bequeathed by the architect Sir John Soane, clerk of works at Westminster until 1794 and 30 years later responsible for modifications there.Panel Paintings from the Palace of Westminster, London, British Museum The Painted Chamber survived largely intact for over 600 years. In the later 13th century, some of the early English Parliaments summoned by Edward I met in the Painted Chamber, and the room continued to be used for important state ceremonies, including the State Opening of Parliament.The Day Parliament Burned Down, Caroline Shenton, p.200-203 The House of Lords met nearby in the Queen's Chamber and later the White Chamber. The House of Commons, however, did not have a chamber of its own; it sometimes held its debates in the Chapter House of Westminster Abbey until a permanent home in the former St Stephen's Chapel became available in the 16th century. The Painted Chamber, between the chambers used by the House of Lords and the House of Commons, was used for the State Opening, and when both Houses met in conference.The Painted Chamber, All Change at the Palace of Westminster, BBC History, 2 February 2005. The many conferences between Commons and Lords that resulted in the Petition of Right were held in the Painted Chamber. E.g. Journal of the House of Lords: Volume 3, 1620-1628 (London, 1767-1830), for 4/7/1728, the date of the first such conference, states that Commons asked for a conference on \\"the Liberty of the Subject\\" and \\"some ancient Fundamental Liberties of the Kingdom.Answered: The Lords will give them a Meeting, by a Committee of both Houses, at Three this Afternoon, in the Painted Chamber.\\" The room was also used for other state purposes. At the trial of Charles I, the evidence of the witnesses summoned was heard in the Painted Chamber rather than Westminster Hall.Paul Binski, The Painted Chamber at Westminster. London: Society of Antiquaries, 1986. (Occasional Paper, n.s. 9.) The death warrant of Charles I was signed here, and the body of Charles II rested the night in this chamber before being interred at Westminster Abbey. It was also used for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth Claypole (the daughter of Oliver Cromwell), William Pitt the Elder, and William Pitt the Younger.Walter Thornbury, 'The royal palace of Westminster', in Old and New London: Volume 3 (London, 1878), pp. 491-502 In around 1820, the room was being used for the Court of Claims. The chamber was gutted in the devastating fire in 1834, but the thick medieval walls survived. Wood salvaged from the Painted Chamber was used to make souvenirs. The room was re-roofed and re-furnished to be used temporarily by the House of Lords for the State Opening of Parliament on 23 February 1835. It was used by the House of Lords until 1847, and finally demolished in 1851.

The school particularly serves the northern and eastern part of Calcutta and North 24 Parganas District. Campus As the school was also a residential school for orphans and the underprivileged till 2006, it also has dormitories, a dining hall and a kitchen, along with servants quarters and the three main school buildings.

It is run by the Congregation of Christian Brothers of Ireland. Nursery section and +2 level i.e. Class XI and XII(commerce section ) has been introduced. However, the school doesn't have science or humanities sections in the higher secondary level yet. From the 2012 session admission of girls to the +2 level has started, breaking the school's long-standing reputation of being a premier Boys' only school, in Calcutta. However, in a kind of way the school had become co-ed much earlier, as the open school under the NIOS which is personally supervised by the Brothers had been co-ed since inception. The open school drives literacy among the poor and underprivileged. St. Mary's provides +2 education under NIOS. Secondary education under NIOS is provided by its sister school St. George's in Bowbazar (Central Calcutta). Up to the 1990s, the Brothers used to oversee the running of the school, and also used to take classes. They could be seen roaming the long aisles and corridors of the school in their white cassocks. However, post the 1990s, the school started appointing specialist educationists as the Principal or Headmistress (Starting with Ms. Paula Ghosh), and the running of the day school was handed over to them, while the Brothers took a backseat and focused primarily on overall administration of the school and social upliftment of the underprivileged, apart from running the NIOS section of the school. The school has had two Headmistresses in the past in Ms. Paula Ghosh and Ms. Dorothy Noronha and the day school is now being administered by the Principal, Br. Sabinho D'Souza.

Wewak, New Guinea, March 1944 Skip bombing was a low-level bombing technique independently developed by several of the combatant nations in World War II, notably Italy, Australia, Britain, and the United States. It allows an aircraft to attack shipping by skipping the bomb across the water like a stone. Dropped at very low altitudes, the bomb never rises more than about above the surface of the water, ensuring that it will hit the side of the ship as long as it is aimed correctly. As the technique required the aircraft to fly at very low altitudes directly at the ship, it made shooting down the aircraft easier as well. In the immediate pre-war era, there was considerable effort to develop new bombsights that would allow the aircraft to remain at higher altitudes. The most notable was the US Navy's Norden bombsight, which was fit to most Navy aircraft. In practice, these proved largely useless, and the skip-bombing technique was soon introduced operationally. After Pearl Harbor (December 1941), it was used prominently against Imperial Japanese Navy warships and transports by Major William Benn of the 63rd Squadron, 43rd Bomb Group (Heavy), Fifth Air Force, United States Army Air Forces in the Southwest Pacific area theater during World War II. General George Kenney has been credited with being the first american to use skip bombing with the U.S. Army Air Forces. Skip bombing was most famously used in Operation Chastise known as the Dambuster raid. This used specially designed bouncing bombs to skip along the water and destroy the dams. Technique The bombing aircraft flew at very low altitudes () at speeds from . They would release a \\"stick\\" of two to four bombs, usually or bombs preferably equipped with four- to five-second time delay fuzes. The bombs would \\"skip\\" over the surface of the water in a manner similar to stone skipping and either bounce into the side of the ship and detonate, submerge and explode next to the ship, or bounce over the target and miss. Unlike the Upkeep or Highball devices, this technique used standard bomb types, although only bombs with a generally hemispherical nose‚Äîas all regular American World War II general purpose aircraft bombs had‚Äîwould bounce off the water surface properly. A similar technique was mast-height bombing, in which bombers would approach the target at low altitude, , at about , and then drop down to mast height, at about from the target. They would release their bombs at around , aiming directly at the side of the ship. In practice, the techniques were often combined: a bomber would drop two bombs, skipping the first and launching the second at mast height. The Battle of the Bismarck Sea would demonstrate the effectiveness of these low-level attacks on ships. Practice missions were carried out against the , a liner that had run aground in 1923. =Aircraft= Various aircraft types were used for skip-bombing attacks, including B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers, B-25 Mitchell medium bombers, and A-20 Havoc attack bombers. These were supported by heavily armed Royal Australian Air Force Bristol Beaufighters, which would suppress Japanese antiaircraft fire with their machine guns and cannon. The Soviets used lend- leased A-20 Havocs and P-40 Tomahawks as well as Il-2 Sturmoviks (also used for air defence suppression). Skip bombers were often used by aviation of the Soviet Northern Fleet in combination with torpedo bombers (usually the same A-20 aircraft, skip bombers and torpedo bombers operated in pairs). Skip bombers were called \\"topmachtoviks\\" (—Ç–æ–ø–º–∞—á—Ç–æ–≤–∏–∫–∏) in Russian, because they were flying \\"at the level of ship mast tops\\". Advantages and disadvantages Skip bombing carried several advantages. Unguided, unpowered bombs are vastly cheaper than torpedoes of equivalent explosive power. Torpedoes take up to several minutes to reach their targets after launch, enough time for an agile ship with an attentive crew to turn and avoid the attack or minimize its damage; skipped bombs, however, reach their targets in seconds. Skip bombing is additionally carried out at high speeds, increasing bombers' chances of surviving anti-aircraft fire as aerial torpedoes of the era were dropped at relatively low speeds. The main drawback of skip bombing was that it took a great deal of skill to perfect; sometimes the bombs would detonate too soon, or in some cases, sink too deep before its delay-fuzed explosion.Dr. Carlson, Florida Gulf Coast University. History The first use of low-altitude bombing in WWII properly belongs to the British. On September 4, 1939, 15 British Bristol Blenheim bombers assaulted a group of German vessels near Wilhelmshaven, Germany. From an altitude of 100 feet, the aircraft crews dropped their bombs straight onto the decks of the ships‚Äînot skipped them up to or into the hulls. These first efforts failed to sink the ships because the bombs had insufficient time to arm before impact. They did, however, demonstrate the precision of a low-altitude attack. The British continued to use low-altitude techniques and eventually began to incorporate skip bombing into their tactics. Although historically, American skip bombing started with the prewar attack doctrine espoused by General George Kenney, practically, it began on August 26, 1941, when General Henry \\"Hap\\" Arnold, Chief of the Army Air Forces (US), heard details of a British skip bombing attack at an Allied conference in England. Upon his return from England, General Arnold charged developmental teams at Eglin Army Airfield, Florida with the task of creating an American version of skip bombing. Major William Benn, General Kenney's aide, had witnessed some of the testing at Eglin during the summer of 1942. In July of that year, Kenney and Benn conducted their own ad hoc experiment in Nadi, Fiji on Kenney's way to take command of the Fifth Army Air Force based in Australia. In late September 1942, Major Benn, then commanding the 63d BS of the 43d Bombardment Group, was using a wrecked ship, , sitting on a reef outside Port Moresby Harbor for skip bombing training. By the time the Eglin Airfield test results were released in December 1942, Benn and the 63d BS, 43d BG, Fifth Army Air Force had already put low-altitude and skip bombing into practice. The first time skip bombing was used in action by U.S. pilots was against Japanese warships at Rabaul on New Britain on the night of October 22‚Äì23, 1942, where B-17 heavy bombers attacked and destroyed the enemy vessels. With the continuing success against shipping in Rabaul Harbor throughout October and November 1942, both the tactic and the term 'skip bombing' had become popular in the Fifth Army Air Force. A notable use of this technique was during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, March 2‚Äì4, 1943, off the northern coast of New Guinea.

It is used during well drilling operations in the oil and gas industry. In general, it can also describe a niche of the industry that involves using a slickline truck or doing a slickline job. Slickline looks like a long, smooth, unbraided wire, often shiny, silver/chrome in appearance. It comes in varying lengths, according to the depth of wells in the area it is used (it can be ordered to specification) up to 35,000 feet in length. It is used to lower and raise downhole tools used in oil and gas well maintenance to the appropriate depth of the drilled well. In use and appearance it is connected by a drum as it is spooled off the back of the slickline truck to the wireline sheave, a round wheel grooved and sized to accept a specified line and positioned to redirect the line to another sheave that will allow the slickline to enter the wellbore.http://wirelinehq.com/wireline-basics/wireline-sheave-wheels/ Slickline is used to lower downhole tools into an oil or gas well to perform a specified maintenance job downhole. Downhole refers to the area in the pipe below surface, the pipe being either the casing cemented in the hole by the drilling rig (which keeps the drilled hole from caving in and pressure from the various oil or gas zones downhole from feeding into one another) or the tubing, a smaller diameter pipe hung inside the casing. Uses Slickline is more commonly used in production tubing. The wireline operator monitors at surface the slickline tension via a weight indicator gauge and the depth via a depth counter 'zeroed' from surface, lowers the downhole tool to the proper depth, completes the job by manipulating the downhole tool mechanically, checks to make sure it worked if possible, and pulls the tool back out by winding the slickline back onto the drum it was spooled from. The slickline drum is controlled by a hydraulic pump, which in turn is controlled by the 'slickline operator'. Slickline comes in different sizes and grades. The larger the size, and higher the grade, generally means the higher line tension can be pulled before the line snaps at the weakest spot and causes a costly 'fishing' job. Due to downhole tools getting stuck because of malfunctions or 'downhole conditions' including sand, scale, salt, asphaltenes, and other well byproducts settling or loosening off the pipe walls because of agitation either by the downhole tools or a change in downhole inflow, sometimes it is necessary to pull hard on the tools to bring them back uphole to surface. If the tools are stuck, and the operator pulls too hard, the line will snap or pull apart at the weakest spot, which is generally closer to surface as the further uphole the weak point in the line is, the more weight it has to support (the weight of the line). Weak spots in the line can be caused by making the circle around the counter wheel, making a bend around a sheave, a kink in a line from normal use (when rigging up the equipment extra line must be pulled out from the truck to give enough slack when the pressure control lubricator is picked up - this leaves line coiled on the often rutted ground, and sometimes it snags and kinks the line). When the slickline parts, this can create an expensive 'fishing' job. It is called fishing because you often have to try different 'fishing' tools until you get a 'bite', then you have to work the original tools downhole free, or cut off the slickline where they join the tools downhole so that you can pull the broken slickline back to surface and out of the way, in order to fish the stuck toolstring. Because of the downtime involved in 'fishing', meaning not being able to flow the oil/gas well, the client is losing money by lack of production and also the cost of the slickline unit to fish, and the cost of what is left in the hole if it is not fished out (in the oil/gas industry, if the cause of the fishing job was not the fault of the slickline company, the oil/gas company is usually responsible to pay for it, and it can be very expensive). Slickline was originally called measuring line, because the line was flat like a tape measure, and marked with depth increments so the operators would know how deep in the hole they were. This probably changed because the flat measuring line wasn't as strong as the modern slickline, and separate depth counters were developed. It is advantageous to keep the diameter of the wire as small as possible for the following reasons: * It reduces the load of its own weight. * It can be run over smaller diameter sheaves, and wound on smaller diameter spools or reels without overstressing by bending (where the wire bends makes it weaker. Where it makes a complete circle, such as a counter wheel, makes it weaker yet). * It keeps the reel drum size to a minimum (which reduces the area needed in the back of the slickline unit to house the drum and hydraulic pump, reducing weight and leaving more room for the other specialized equipment needed for slickline operations). * It provides a small cross-section area for operation under pressure. The disadvantage of a smaller diameter slickline is the lower strength. Depth and the nature of the job (a tool that must be pulled hard or might be stuck) will affect what slickline truck (different trucks specialize in different sizes of line) used. The sizes of solid wireline in most common uses are: 0.092\\", 0.108\\", 0.125\\", 0.140\\", 0.150\\", and 0.160\\" in diameter, and are obtainable from the wire-drawing mills in one-piece standard lengths of 18,000, 20,000, 25,000 and 30,000 foot lengths. Other diameters and lengths are usually available on request from the suppliers, with the largest size currently available at 0.188\\". Mechanical and Hydraulic Jars Slickline tools operate with a mechanical action, controlled from surface in the wireline trucks operators compartment. Typically, this mechanical action is accomplished by the operation of jars. There are generally two types of jars; mechanical and hydraulic. Mechanical jars look like a long, tubular piece of machined metal that slides longer or shorter approximately 75% to 90% of its total length. They give the effect of hammering on the downhole tools. The weight or hit of the 'hammer' depends on how much sinker bar is added above the jars. Generally, a slickline operator controls the downhole tools with taps and hits from the sinker bar via the mechanical jars, controlled at surface by lowering or raising the toolstring and monitoring weight, depth, and pressure. Mechanical jars for slickline can hit up or down the hole, making them a versatile form of jarring. Hydraulic jars for slickline are generally meant to jar up only, because not enough sinker bar is able to feasibly be lubricated in to jar down on the downhole tools. Hydraulic jars work by the operator pulling up on the line, which puts an upward force on the top of the hydraulic jars. The bottom of the hydraulic jars is usually attached by threaded connection to the mechanical jars, which are attached to the downhole tools. Depending on how hard the operator pulls on the hydraulic jars will affect how fast they hit, and how hard they hit. When the top is pulled on, the inner mandrel begins to slide upwards. It has a restriction in it that hydraulic fluid has to bypass as it is pulled upwards, until it reaches an area of no restriction, allowing it to slide rapidly. The reason for the initial tighter restriction is to allow the operator to pull his line to the desired hitting range. Generally once he hits that range on his weight indicator, he waits while the jars open to the less restricted point, whereupon the sinker bar travels upwards rapidly, providing an upwards hit on the downhole tools. The jars can then be 'reset' by lowering the line until the weight of the sinker bar closes, or pushes the inner mandrel of the hydraulic jars back to the starting position. Because the hydraulic jars are designed to provide a wait time to allow the operator to get up to the desired line tension, they can provide a very effective upwards hit. Mechanical jar and hydraulic jar hitting power is affected by the length of the jars (the longer the length, they faster they can travel before they stop), the mass of the weight above them (the more the mass, the harder they will hit), and the tension of the line pulling on them. Some completion components may be deployed and retrieved on slickline such as wireline retrievable safety valves, battery powered downhole gauges, perforating, placing explosively set bridge plugs, and placing or retrieving gas lift valves. Slickline can also be used for fishing, the process of trying to retrieve other equipment and wire, which has been dropped down the hole. Applications The most common applications for slickline are: * Tagging T.D. (Total Depth, which is the furthest depth possible down the wellbore) * Gauge Ring runs (which is running a special sized downhole tool called a gauge ring, which comes in various pre- machined diameters, designed to ensure the pipe is clear to a certain point) *Tubing Broach / Plunger Installations (a tubing broach looks like an aggressive, tubular file, available in different diameters, used for removing burrs and crimps in the inside of tubing and casing in oil and gas wells)Tubing Broach * Bailing sand and debris (removing formation sand/rock and other such debris left over from the drilling and completion of the well, using a specialized tool called a bailer. This tool uses either a Chinese water pump type stroke action or a hydrostatic vacuum action to suction up the downhole debris, allowing it to be conveyed back to surface via the wireline) * Shifting sleeves (formations downhole can be isolated behind sliding metal 'windows' called sliding sleeves. They are shifted open or closed by means of a specialized shifting tool locating the sleeve and it being jarred up or down, providing access or closing off that formation or section of casing) * Setting / Pulling plugs and chokes (specialized downhole tools which either lock into pre-machined restrictions in the tubing, or which lock into the tubing itself, sealing pressure from below or above the plug) * Setting / Pulling gas lift valves * Running tailpipes (tubing extensions where the tubing is not landed close enough to the formation perforations in the casing) * Bottom hole pressure and temperature surveys (specialized electronic and mechanical tools designed to measure the pressure and temperature at predetermined depths in the wellbore. This data can be used to determine reservoir life) * Spinner Surveys (to determine which formation perforations have the best inflow / which perforations make the most water / liquids) * Kinley perforator, sandline cutter, and caliper * Running production logging tools * Fishing operations (fishing usually refers to attempting to retrieve lost tools or wire, or other debris that was not intended to restrict the flow / disrupt the well operations. Fishing can be difficult, due to the fish being downhole, and other affecting conditions such as high pressure, the fish being jammed in the tubing / casing) * Paraffin cutting (making a hole through and removing a wax buildup, which is a byproduct of oil cooling too much to reach surface) * Chipping ice / salt (restrictions and plugs which can be formed as by products of a flowing well) * Lubricating long assemblies in and out of the hole (lubricating is done via a larger than tool overall diameter pipe, joined at surface on top of the wellhead, which houses the valve that shuts the pressure in downhole. The lubricator should be long enough to be able to swallow the toolstring and downhole tools that are to be run or pulled) Braided line Braided line is generally used when the strength of slickline is insufficient for the task. Most commonly, this is for heavy fishing such as retrieving broken drill pipe. Slickline Tools=Jar= This type of tool can be extended and closed rapidly to induce a mechanical shock to the tool string. This shock can induce certain components such as plugs to lock into place and then unlock for retrieving. Jars are commonly used to shear small brass or steel pins that are put in place to function certain down-hole tools at a certain moment. The operator can use the jars to shear the pins at a predetermined depth. Spang jars are manually operated by the wireline operator who either lifts or lowers wire rapidly, requiring a great deal expertise. =Stem= Stem essentially just serves to add weight to the toolstring. The weight may be necessary to overcome the pressure of the well. Some variations of stem, called roller stem, may have wheels built into the tool to allow the tool string to glide more easily down moderately deviated wells. Stem give the hammering action to the tool string which in turn allows the jars to transmit the force given by the movement of the stems bars. Depending on well conditions, either extra small OD stems are use or extra large. The range can be from .75\\" to 3.50\\" OD and the stems normally come in 2 ft, 3 ft or 5 ft lengths. The connection to the rope socket or other tools can be a threaded connection or a QLS system (quick connect). =Pulling tools= These are tools designed for fishing other wireline components which have been dropped or placed in the well down hole. All wireline tools are designed with 'fishing necks' on their top side, intended to be easily grabbed by pulling tools with a matching 'id' to that of the 'od' of the fishing neck. Pulling tools are also used for retrieving seated components such as plug prongs. Almost all pulling tools are equipped with a safety feature (shear pin) so they may release a stuck tool and allow the tool string to be brought to the surface for changes in components (hydraulic jars for example). =Gauge Cutter (Gauge Ring)= A gauge cutter is a tool with a round, open-ended bottom which is milled to an accurate size. Large openings above the bottom of the tool allow for fluid bypass while running in the hole. Most often a gauge ring will be the first tool ran on a slickline operation. A gauge ring that is just undersized will allow the operator to ensure clear tubing down to the deepest projected working depth; for example 2 7/8\\" tubing containing 2.313\\" profiles would call for a gauge ring between 2.25\\" - 2.30\\". A gauge ring can also be used to remove light paraffin that may have built up in the tubing. Often a variety of different sized gauges and/or scratchers will be run to remove paraffin little by little. Gauge cutter can be used for drift runs also. =Lead impression block= If an obstruction is found downhole, a lead impression block can be run to help determine its nature. The LIB has a malleable lead base in which the obstruction can leave an impression when they meet. The LIB is called Wireline Camera because of its function to mark any object downhole. They are also sometimes called \\"confusion\\" blocks because they only give a two-dimensional view of the down-hole object, making it hard for an inexperienced person to determine what three-dimensional object is in the hole =Downhole bailer= Bailers are downhole tools that are generally long and tubular shaped, and are used for both getting samples of downhole solids (sand, scale, asphaltenes, rust, rubber and debris from well servicing operations) and for 'bailing' the unwanted downhole solids from the well. Bailers are attached either via threaded connection or releasable downhole tool to the wireline toolstring, and are manipulated from surface by the wireline operator. Bailers usually have an interchangeable bottom (the shoe) which also houses a check to keep the solids from falling or washing out of the bottom. =Sample bailer= A sample bailer is a hollow tube (the barrel), generally around a meter long, around 40 mm in diameter, with a 'ball check' - a form of non-return valve - on the bottom and an opening at the top. This tool is beat downwards into the obstruction using the mechanical jars and weight above of the wireline toolstring. Generally, after a number of 'hits', hopefully allowing a usable sample of solids to enter the barrel, the tool is pulled upwards, and the sample in the barrel should settle the ball check onto its seat, which will keep the solids in the barrel during the return trip to surface, where the sample can be inspected to determine the composition of the obstruction. The success of this depends on how readily the solid was accepted into the barrel, and if the ball check was properly seated on the return trip to surface. If the ball check is not seated (sometimes a large, hard piece of solid will sit in between the ball and seat) downhole fluids tend to wash the sample out of the bottom of the sample bailer, leaving the inspectors at surface uncertain whether the tool actually collected a sample. The procedure may have to be repeated until a sample is successfully retrieved. =Stroke bailer= A stroke bailer functions like a 'Chinese water pump', and is used to collect unwanted solids from the wellbore. A stroke bailer is long and tubular looking, with a smaller rod that extends from the top, a hole in the bottom, and is generally around 7 meters long, but the length depends on how much barrel section is added to the bailer. The barrel 'free floats' on the stroke rod, which is attached to the wireline toolstring. The tool is usually 'spudded' into the downhole solid, then the wireline toolstring is pulled upwards, which in turn pulls the stroke up through the barrel. Ideally, this draws the downhole solid in through the bottom 'shoe' of the tool, past the check and into the barrel for collection. The tool is usually stroked either a predetermined number of times, or until it appears the tool is not stroking, which can mean either it is full, or stuck. =Hydrostatic bailer= A hydrostatic bailer functions like a 'vacuum', and is used to suck up unwanted solids from the wellbore. A hydrostatic bailer is generally around 2.5 meters long and is tubular looking, with two 10 mm holes on opposing sides at the top of the tool, and a hole in the bottom. A hydrostatic bailer uses a pinned plug with o-ring seals at the bottom, and a plug at the top to maintain the surface pressure that it was assembled at (nominally around 100 kPa) all the way to the bottom of the well, whereupon it is spudded into the downhole solids, which ideally pushes the shoe into the bottom plug, which shears the pin on the bottom plug. An oil or gas well's pressure downhole is always more than atmospheric pressure at surface, due to the formation pressure, and a combination of depth and hydrostatic weight of wellbore fluids. Sometimes fluid will be added to the wellbore to assist in bailing by bringing up the pressure, and also lubricating the downhole solid. Because the pressure inside the bailer is much less than the downhole wellbore pressure, any solids that are loose enough are 'sucked up' by the vacuum formed when the bottom plug is sheared and travels upwards through the barrel, followed by the solids. At the same time, due to the changed from negative pressure to positive pressure, the top plug pops out (and is caught by the top part of the tool), and excess flow is directed out through the 10 mm ports on the sides of the top of the tool. These ports allow the barrel to fill more readily. Then the bailer is returned to surface where it is taken apart, the solids are emptied, and it is cleaned and serviced with new o-ring seals. Care must be taken when disassembling at surface as the tool is potentially charged with the downhole pressure (possibly many tens of thousands of kpa) and may 'blow apart' when being unthreaded if not bled off first. =Running Tools= These tools are primarily used to 'set' plugs into locking profiles (nipples) located in the tubing; however, the term 'running tool' refers to a downhole tool attached to the wireline toolstring that is used to 'run' another tool that is meant to be left downhole when the toolstring returns to surface. In general, a running tool is attached to a downhole 'locking tool' that locates and locks into the selected downhole profile (nipple). The 'locking tool', or 'lock' for short, can be attached via threaded connection to the top of a variety of different tools, including but not limited to, downhole chokes (flow rate restrictors sized according to a pre-determined calculation), one-way check valves (TKX style plugs), instrument hangers, and most commonly, tubing plugs. The lock is fitted onto the running tool and attached using shear pins made of brass or steel. When the target profile is reached the lock can be set by seating the lock into the profile using mechanical jars (spangs) until the locking keys have locked the lock into the profile, whereupon the operator usually 'pull tests' the lock to give an indication it is properly 'set', then shears off the shear pins with his mechanical or hydraulic jars to allow the 'toolstring' to return to surface. There are many different types of running tools, some are mechanically complex and able to be made 'selective' in order to pass through profiles in order to reach one of the same size but a different depth; some are relatively simple, such as an 'F' collarstop running tool, which is essentially a metal rod which fits inside the collarstop downhole tool which is pinned in place.

Coat of arms Altheim's coat of arms displays three plates upon a field of blue. At the top of the blazon is a white chief and upon that a blue, engrailed and invected line. This coat of arms was first adopted by the municipal council of Altheim on 3 March 1937 with permission from its owner, Baron Conrad von Freyberg, head of a local noble house that had lived in the area since 1528. A request to for approval of official use of this coat of arms was sent to the Reichsstatthalter of W√ºrttemberg, though approval did not materialize. A modified version was used through World War II, with the field behind the roundels was turned black and a yellow chief containing a black stag antler. On 24 August 1957, the Federal Ministry of the Interior approved the Freyberg coat of arms, but changed the chief to its current state as a reference to Altheim's 13th century owners, the Lords of Steu√ülingen. A municipal flag was issued alongside the official coat of arms.

According to the 2011 census, the village has a population of 2,458. Crossgates has a long history of mining, both deep and opencast. In 2008 ATH Resources opened an opencast mine at Muir Dean to the south of the village, with the intention of removing 2,000,000 tons of coal. Planning permission for the mine was initially refused by Fife Council but the decision was later overturned by the Scottish Government. In April 2011, an application for an extension to the Muir Dean mine was lodged by ATH Resources to extend the surface mine to the south, which was granted. ATH Resources went into administration, leaving an ecological disaster with an uncertain future at the time. The majority of reparation works have now been completed, with the former mine infilled, and the landscape returned to farmland.

The fort is considered to be the oldest stone fort in the Americas, and was listed in 1982 as part of the UNESCO World Heritage site of \\"Old Havana and its Fortifications\\". History A previous fort, the Fuerza Vieja (Old Fort), was badly damaged in 1555 during an attack on Havana by the French privateer Jacques de Sores and eventually was demolished in 1582. In 1558 Bartolom√© S√°nchez, an engineer appointed by King Philip II of Spain, began work on the new fort, initially known as the Fuerza Nueva (New Fort). The Fuerza Vieja was set back from the harbour, but the new fort was planned to be closer to the harbour to give it a better location. The ironworks were established in 1558, but the first stones were not laid until 1562. Construction was delayed due to complaints from local residents forced to relocate to make way for the building and from disagreements between S√°nchez and the Governor of Havana. The fort was not completed until 1577, with slaves and French prisoners providing most of the labour. The fort was built of limestone quarried from the Havana shoreline and the fortification incorporated thick sloping walls, a moat, and a drawbridge. The governor, Francisco Carre√±o, ordered the addition an upper storey as barracks and a munitions store, but on completion, the fort proved to be too small for practical use. La Giradilla on the watchtower (inset: The original, which is now held in the Palacio de los Capitanes Generales)A view of the watchtower from the outside Despite being positioned closer to the harbour than the Fuerza Vieja, it quickly became apparent that the new fort was still too distant from the mouth of the harbour to serve effectively as a defensive bulwark. Instead Juan de Tejeda adopted it as the residence of the Governor of Havana. Subsequent governors made changes to the building. The fa√ßade of the fortress was demolished in 1851 to allow O‚ÄôReilly Street to go all the way to the docks, and prevent the fort from overshadowing El Templete, which was completed in 1828. La Fuerza Fortress (circa 1921-1939) =La Giraldilla= In 1634, Juan Vitri√°n de Viamonte added a watchtower with a weathervane sculpted in the form of a woman, by Ger√≥nimo Mart√≠n Pinz√≥n, an artist from Havana, and based on the figure crowning La Giralda in Seville. Although the reason for the choice of this figure, called La Giraldilla, is not known, a common belief is that it honours Isabel de Bobadilla, Havana's only female governor, who assumed control from her husband Hernando de Soto when he undertook an expedition to Florida. She spent many years scanning the horizon for signs of his returning ship (unbeknownst to her, he had died). The figure became the symbol of the city of Havana (it features on the Havana Club rum label), and the original is now in the City Museum housed in the Palacio de los Capitanes Generales in the Plaza de Armas; the figure on the watchtower is a later copy. Use The fort was home to the National Archive from 1899 and the National Library from 1938 up until 1957, when both were relocated to a purpose-built library in Plaza de la Revoluci√≥n. After the Cuban Revolution in 1959, the fort housed the offices of the National Commission of Monuments and the Centre of Preservation, Restoration and Museology. The fort served briefly as the Museum of Arms, but the conditions within the fortress were not conducive to the preservation of the displays. In 1977, on the 400th anniversary of completion, the building was inaugurated as a museum and used to display exhibitions of Cuban contemporary and international art. In 1990, it became the National Museum of Cuban Ceramics. In 2010, Castillo de la Real Fuerza reopened as Cuba‚Äôs premier maritime museum. (There is also a small naval museum in Cienfuegos.) The museum contains excellent exhibits of Cuba‚Äôs maritime past from pre-Columbian days through to the 18th century with the Royal Shipyard of Havana, one of the largest in the world, which built nearly 200 ships for the Spanish Crown. The museum features a huge four-metre model of the Santisima Trinidad located on the main floor with a large interactive touch screen in Spanish, French, and English. The exhibit describes life aboard an 18th-century ship-of-the-line. The original ship was launched into Havana Bay on 2 March 1769 and was the largest ship in the world in the 18th century, with 140 cannons on four gun decks. She was one of four Cuban-built ships at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Downstairs you will find ancient navigational instruments, underwater archaeological artifacts, and gold and silver from the colonial era. Also note the original weathervane, La Giraldilla, while her replica moves in the breeze on the top of the fortress tower, which also commands a fantastic view of the city. The second level of the museum hosts many other historic and contemporary models of ships with links to Cuba and is also a good location for viewing the harbour and city skyline. The castle has thick sloping walls to fend off attackers.

He is known for being one of the first riders to take freestyle tricks more commonly performed in man-made terrain parks into the big mountain freeriding environments of Alaska.http://snowboardermag.com/features/riderprofiles/johan- olofsson/ Olofsson originally came from a freestyle background; when he arrived on the Alaskan snowboarding scene, he quickly adapted his spin tricks and jibs to the backcountry environment. Olofsson rapidly gained attention and respect from the freeriding community when he started doing these tricks off natural features such as windlips and cliffs in the midst of terrifyingly steep lines in the Alaskan ranges. In the Standard Films movie TB5 (his first part in a major snowboard release), he was filmed in Alaska attacking a line with such ferocity that he stunned the snowboarding world and instantly gained legendary status. From the top of the line to foot of the descent, on a slope of over 40 degrees, he travelled over 3000 vertical feet in a mere 35 seconds, averaging over 120 km/h, a feat which got him into the 1996 Guinness Book of World Records and the Snowboarding Hall of Fame.http://www.northface.ie/aunz/athletes/athletes-JO.html He featured in two films Snowriders 2 (1997) and Freeriders (1998). Olofsson spent his entire snowboarding career (some eight years) with Burton as his primary sponsor. After a series of injuries between 2001 and 2004 he was dropped by Burton and has been without a sponsor ever since. He announced his retirement from professional snowboarding in 2005 and went on to work on a project building a snowpark at Dundret in G√§llivare (Sweden) in 2007, called Thunderpark. He moved on from Thunderpark, and went pro for The North Face.http://espn.go.com/action/news/story?id=4149942 He features in Teton Gravity Research's 2010 movie Deeper.http://www.tetongravity.com/athletes/series/deeper.aspx Just recently, Venture Snowboards from Silverton, CO, has brought him on board as a product tester to aid product design and development of their boards.

Texts of this form give the appearance of being composed in a grid with the same number of letters in each line and each space in the grid filled with a single letter; hence, there are no spaces between words, and no spaces or punctuation between sentences. The majority are Attic, but it was widely used in the Greek world, and the earliest examples are from not later than the mid-6th century BCE; the first is perhaps the Phrasikleia Kore or the Salaminian Decree.See Marcus Tod, A Selection of Greek Historical Inscriptions, 1933, for dating. It was the dominant style of inscription in Athens during the 5th and 4th centuries BCE and was the preferred style for official state proclamations. The last stoichedon text dates from the 3rd century CE and is the genealogical inscription from the Heroon of Oenoanda in Lycia. RP Austin, op cit. p.117. The idiom was less common in Latin epigraphy, a rare exception is the Sator square. This form of inscription is of particular interest to scholars of Greek epigraphy due to the chance it affords to reconstruct fragmentary texts. Few, if any, Greek tablets survive intact; however, the language and tenor of inscriptions are often formulaic and with a knowledge of the precise number of missing letters it is possible to make an informed guess about the lost text.

It was the seventh named storm, fifth hurricane and third major hurricane of the 1969 season. Gerda formed on September 6 and crossed Florida as a tropical depression. Gerda later became a tropical storm after making a hard right turn and moving northeast and reaching hurricane status on September 8. Gerda brushed past the Outer Banks of North Carolina before reaching maximum intensity of 125 mph (205 km/h) and a low barometric pressure of . On September 10, Gerda made landfall near Eastport, Maine, and became extratropical the following day. Hurricane Gerda brought light rain across southern Florida and moderate to heavy rain across eastern North Carolina and New England, causing minor damage to trees and powerlines. The highest amount of rain was which was recorded in South Wellfleet, Massachusetts on Cape Cod. There were no fatalities or injuries from Gerda although planes at Otis Air Force Base were moved to their hangars and two ships from Naval Station Newport left their berth to ride out the storm. Meteorological history A tropical wave moved off the eastern coast of Africa on August 21 and moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean without development. On September 3, the disturbance merged with a dissipating upper level low pressure system over Hispaniola and Puerto Rico and developed an increasing cloud mass as it continued westward. As the disturbance crossed the Bahamas, satellite imagery showed the disturbance gaining a distinct circulation on September 5. On September 6, the disturbance became a Tropical Depression before it made landfall in southeastern Florida on the same day. After crossing Florida, the depression drifted northeastward back over the western Atlantic Ocean on September 7. As the system headed northeastward, hurricane hunter aircraft recorded winds of 45 mph (72 km/h), and barometric pressure fell to . Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center upgraded the system to tropical storm status and named it Gerda. Gerda continued to move rapidly northeast in response to an approaching trough and the storm reached hurricane status on September 8. Gerda's forward speed approached 40 mph (64 km/h) as the eye of the hurricane passed 50 miles (80 km) east of Cape Cod on September 9, with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h). Because the storm was interacting with the trough to the west and was moving rapidly northeastward, the result was the minimum central barometric pressure was an unusually high . Gerda later made landfall near Eastport, Maine later that day as a Category 2 hurricane, one of the strongest to ever make landfall in the state. Gerda then became extratropical as it crossed into Canada as an 80 mph (130 km/h) extratropical storm on September 10. The storm later dissipated the following day. Preparations Rainfall from Gerda Gale warnings and small craft advisories were issued along the coast of North Carolina stretching from Wilmington to Cape Hatteras. Storm shelters in Kitty Hawk and Manteo, North Carolina were opened and the American Red Cross sent relief workers and equipment to North Carolina. In Frederick County, Maryland, local forecasters and the National Weather Service issued a flood watch while the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for the county, as well as the rest of eastern Maryland. Officials at the National Weather Service and National Hurricane Center predicted that the western half of the storm would lash New York City and much of New England (which were under a hurricane watch) with high winds and torrential rainfall. Ships and other water craft were advised to avoid the Cape Cod area as the storm was forecast to brush that area, which was put under a hurricane warning by the National Hurricane Center. In Massachusetts, schools were closed and emergency shelters were opened to accommodate evacuees. Evacuations were ordered for residents living in low- lying areas in Cape Cod. In Boston, the threat of the storm caused both elementary and middle schools to close at noon while high schools were closed at 1 p.m. (est). The approach of the storm also postponed a fair at a local hospital and planes at Otis Air Force Base were quickly moved to their hangars. Much of southeastern Massachusetts civil defense and fire departments were alerted in preparation of the storm's impact. In Rhode Island, schools and other buildings were used as shelter to house evacuees. As Hurricane Gerda sped up the East Coast of the United States, the National Hurricane Center extended the hurricane warnings from Block Island, Rhode Island to Eastport, Maine. At Naval Station Newport in Newport, Rhode Island, two ships of the United States Navy left their berths to ride out the storm. One of which was the Comsixthflt flagship USS Puget Sound (AD-38). Impact Hurricane Gerda affected much of eastern North Carolina and New England with gusty rain and heavy rainfall causing minor to moderate damage. In Florida, Gerda dropped light rainfall across southern and central portions of the state. Damage there, if any, was unknown. In South Carolina, Gerda brought sustained winds of 20 mph (32 km/h). In Canada, Gerda passed over Labrador as a strong extratropical storm with hurricane-force winds. Damage there is unknown. In North Carolina, Gerda produced moderate rainfall across the Outer Banks. The highest rainfall total on the Outer Banks was in Cape Hatteras. Elsewhere on the Outer Banks, the storm produced 27 mph (43 km/h) winds with gusts up to 36 mph (58 km/h). A tide gauge in Ocracoke Island reported a tide of 1.5 feet (0.45 meter) above normal. Gerda then dropped heavy rainfall across eastern Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey and New York. There was no reported damage from Gerda's impact on North Carolina and the Mid-Atlantic States. Gerda produced heavy rainfall throughout much of southeastern New England. In Massachusetts, a rain gauge in South Wellfleet reported rainfall of . The city of Lowell also reported heavy rainfall from the storm as of rain fell in a 24‚Äëhour period. The heavy rainfall caused isolated street flooding due to clogged storm drains. In Fitchburg, the storm dropped of rain while Cape Cod received tides 3‚Äì6 feet (0.91-1.83 meters) above normal. Elsewhere in New England, the storm caused minor damage to trees, powerlines and highways. There were no reported fatalities or injuries from Gerda's impact on New England.

Nigeria has had a series of constitutions. The current constitution was enacted on 29 May 1999, inaugurating the Nigerian Fourth Republic. Past constitutions=Colonial era (1914-1960)= Nigeria's first constitutions were enacted by order in council during the colonial era, when the country was administered as a Crown Colony. The constitutions enacted during this period were those of 1913 (which came into effect on 1 January 1914), 1922, 1946, 1951 and 1954. In 1946 a new constitution was approved by Westminster and promulgated in Nigeria. Although it reserved effective power in the hands of the Governor-General and his appointed Executive Council, the so-called Richards Constitution (after Governor-General Sir Arthur Richards, who was responsible for its formulation) provided for an expanded Legislative Council empowered to deliberate on matters affecting the whole country. Separate legislative bodies, the houses of assembly, were established in each of the three regions to consider local questions and to advise the lieutenant governors. The introduction of the federal principle, with deliberative authority devolved on the regions, signaled recognition of the country's diversity. Although realistic in its assessment of the situation in Nigeria, the Richards Constitution undoubtedly intensified regionalism as an alternative to political unification. The pace of constitutional change accelerated after the promulgation of the Richards Constitution. It was suspended in 1950 against a call for greater autonomy, which resulted in an inter-parliamentary conference at Ibadan in 1950. The conference drafted the terms of a new constitution. The so-called Macpherson Constitution, after the incumbent Governor-General, John Stuart Macpherson, went into effect the following year. The most important innovations in the new charter reinforced the dual course of constitutional evolution, allowing for both regional autonomy and federal union. By extending the elective principle and by providing for a central government with a Council of Ministers, the Macpherson Constitution gave renewed impetus to party activity and to political participation at the national level. But by providing for comparable regional governments exercising broad legislative powers, which could not be overridden by the newly established 185-seat federal House of Representatives, the Macpherson Constitution also gave a significant boost to regionalism. Subsequent revisions contained in the Lyttleton Constitution, named for Oliver Lyttelton, 1st Viscount Chandos and enacted in 1954, firmly established the federal principle and paved the way for independence. =Constitutional independence (1960 independence constitution)= Nigeria's first constitution as a sovereign state was enacted by a British order in council so as to come into force immediately upon independence, on 1 October 1960. Under this constitution Nigeria retained Queen Elizabeth II as titular head of state. =1963 constitution (First Republic)= Independent Nigeria's second constitution established the country as a federal republic. It came into force on 1st of October,1963 (Nigeria's third anniversary as an independent nation). The 1963 constitution, which was based on the Westminster system, continued in operation until a military coup in 1966 overthrew Nigeria's democratic institutions. =1979 constitution (Second Republic)= The 1979 constitution, which brought in the Second Republic, abandoned the Westminster system in favour of an American-style presidential system, with a direct election, directly-elected. To avoid the pitfalls of the First Republic, the constitution mandated that political parties and Federal Executive Council (Nigeria cabinet) positions reflect the \\"federal character\\" of the nation: political parties were required to be registered in at least two-thirds of the States of Nigeria or states, and each state had to have at least one member of the cabinet from it. =1993 constitution (Third Republic)= The 1993 constitution was intended to see the return of democratic rule to Nigeria with the establishment of a Third Republic, but was never fully implemented, and the military resumed power until 1999 =1999 presidential constitution (Fourth Republic)= The 1999 constitution restored democratic rule to Nigeria, and remains in force today. In January 2011, two amendments of the 1999 constitution were signed by President Olusegun Obasanjo, the first modifications since the document came into use in 1999. :33.

Angelo CAROSELLI, la vita e le opere, in una imponente monografia di Marta Rossetti Caroselli was also active as an art restorer, copyist, and, possibly, forger. Angelo Caroselli at the Netherlands Institute for Art History In recent years a corpus of paintings has been attributed to a yet to be identified artist referred to with the notname of Pseudo-Caroselli. The style of the anonymous artist is so close to that of Caroselli that it is believed that this artist must have been in direct contact with Caroselli. The resulting similarity in styles has made it difficult to attribute certain works with certainty to either of the two artists. Life Angelo Caroselli was born in Rome on 11 February 1585. His father was a reseller of second-hand gold and silver, a low-class activity in those days.Passeri, page 188 He grew up in a popular neighborhood of Rome. Angelo did not get a formal training but was self- taught. He learned to paint by working as an art restorer and copyist. He became very skilled at copying older masters such as Annibale Carracci, Titian and Caravaggio. It is said that Poussin could not distinguish Caroselli's copy of a Madonna by Raphael from the original. It was rumored that he was also an art forger and passed some of his copies off as originals. Passeri describes how Angelo Caroselli dressed in a very strict Stoic fashion, giving up all luxury. This reportedly gave him a laughable appearance and had a negative impact on his reputation. However; this did not stop him from being a playboy who sought out the pleasures of love on which he spent much of his time.Passeri, page 191 Allegory of Youth and Old Age The artist spent time in Florence possibly in 1605‚Äì6 or 1610. Here he was employed to paint copies and pastiches of paintings particularly appreciated by Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. The artist joined the Accademia di San Luca of Rome in 1604 or 1608 and stayed a member until 1636. He was likely a non-voting member until he became 30 years old under the rules introduced by Pope Paul V in 1605. He was able to obtain important commissions including in the Chiesa Nuova. In this church he painted two Prophets and a Piet√† in oil paint on plaster on the walls of the Vittrice Chapel ub 1611‚Äì12. Caroselli collaborated with the Caravaggist Giovanni Francesco Guerrieri during that artist's stay in Rome from 1615 to 1618. They jointly created Caravaggesque scenes for the Palazzo Borghese in Campo Marzio.Caravaggio's Friends and Foes exhibition catalogue, Whitfield Fine Art, 2010 Young man playing a lute by candlelight In 1615 Caroselli married Maria Turca or Turcha (also erroneously called 'Zurca'), whose father was a Sicilian of Palermo who had lived in Rome for many years. Passeri goes on to state that the family lived in dire straits as Caroselli did not get many commissions. For that reason the young couple left Rome in 1616, and after spending possibly some months in Piedimonte Matese in the province of Caserta, they settled in Naples.Passeri, page 190 The family's single daughter and three sons Carlo, Angelo and Francesco were all born in Naples. The first born was the daughter Giacoma who was baptized in Naples on 26 September 1516. The last son was baptized in Naples on 25 February 1623.Marta Rossetti, Note sul soggiorno napoletano di Angelo Caroselli (1585-1652), appunti sulla parentesi fiorentina e alcune opere inedite, in: L'Acropoli, Anno XI - n. 5, p. 530 The Caresolle family moved back to Rome in 1626. Caroselli was notorious for his love for beautiful women and was often derelict in his marital duties towards his wife. Caroselli was able to attract a number of pupils to his workshop. He shared a studio with Pietro Paolini, a painter originally from Lucca who had come to Rome to study in 1619 when he was only 16 years old. Whereas in the past the relationship between Caroselli and Paolini was regarded solely as that of a master and apprentice, more recently discovered materials point to a more complex relationship, more akin to that of collaborators and characterised by the sharing of themes. Caroselli was continuously absent from Rome from June 1616 until February 1623 so it would have been impossible for Caroselli to be Paolini's master. Paolini's documented presence in Lucca in 1626, at least for the period June‚ÄìOctober further limits the period of their interaction.Patrizia Giusti Maccari, Pietro Paolini, Pandora at Dorotheum Caroselli was an important influence on the style of Paolini's work throughout his career. Blind love, a man playing draughts with a courtesan In the 1630s the artist went through a turbulent time. In that decennium he received a commission from the Barberini family. He also became a friend of Cardinal Lorenzo Magalotti and made a trip to Ferrara with Guercino. In 1635 he worked on frescos in the Palazzo Pamphilj in Rome. He also formed close relationships with Prospero Fagini, Giovanni Francesco Salernitano, a nobleman from Naples, and Giovanni Luca de Franchis, an aristocrat from Genoa.Semprebene, p. 18Marta Rossetti, Musical Instruments in the Life and Work of Angelo Caroselli (15851652), a ‚ÄúCaravaggesque artist‚Äù in: La musica al tempo di Caravaggio, Gangemi Editore spa, p. 201-218 After becoming a widower in 1637 he lived with the painter Agostino Tassi. He was a frequent collaborator of Tassi who used him to paint the large figures in his landscapes.Patrizia Cavazzini, Painting as Business in Early Seventeenth- century Rome, Penn State Press, 2008, p. 56 Caroselli married in 1642 Brigitta (or Brigida) Lauwers (Lauri), the daughter of the Flemish landscape painter Balthasar Lauwers who resided and worked in Rome since the early 1600s. He thus became the brother-in-law of the painters Filippo Lauri and Francesco Lauri.Seicento : le si√®cle de Caravage dans les collections fran√ßaises: Galeries nationales du Grand Palais, Paris, 11 octobre 1988-2 janvier 1989 [et] Palazzo Reale, Milan, mars-avril 1989, R√©union des mus√©es nationaux (France), Milan (Italy). Settore cultura e spettacolo R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, 1988, p. 148 Filipo and Francesco became his pupils and collaborators, as evidenced by the altarpiece of 1631 representing Pope Gregory I executed for the church of S. Francesca Romana. The work, which was clearly influenced by Carlo Saraceni, was almost entirely by the hand of Francesco Lauri. Angelo's own son Carlo was his pupil but his oeuvre is not well established. Tommaso Luini (called il Caravaggino) was also one of his pupils.Patrizia Cavazzini, p. 60 After his second marriage, Caroselli's family life settled down and he became more diligent in his work. Although suffering from ill health, he continued to paint until his death in Rome on 8 April 1652. Work Christ and the adultress He created religious works, allegorical paintings, portraits as well as such genre paintings with musicians and card players as were popular with the Caravaggisti. Caravaggio was an important source of inspiration in terms of his innovations in naturalism as well as subject matter. Caroselli often depicted card players, musicians, prostitutes and other low life scenes of contemporary Rome. He further showed in his oeuvre a fascination with witchcraft, necromancy and the magic arts. As the artist did not date his paintings and his work is eclectic, it is not easy to establish a clear chronology of his output both in terms of subject matter and style.Angelo Caroselli, The Virgin and Child with Saints Elizabeth and the Infant John the Baptist at Galerie Canesso Some art historians see an evolution from an initial naturalistic phase which developed in the 1930s towards a more \\"classicist\\" style, characterized by a greater elegance and softness in the brushstroke and a smoothness of the flesh that contrasts with the hard and sharp manner of the earlier works. In the latter period he also introduced ancient reliefs in his work.Opera d'arte Vanitas di Caroselli Angelo (1585/ 1652), a Roma at Beni-Culturali The style of Caroselli is often described as eclectic. Despite his adherence to the forms and subjects of Caravaggio and the emerging Baroque, Caroselli's works show certain 'archaicising' elements. In this archaic aspect some art historians see a conscious rejection of, and rupture with, the triumphant 'Baroque absolutism' of his age. His early biographers Passeri and Baldinucci also speak at length of his great skill in copying the ancient masters and in working in different styles at the same time. St Sebastian tended by Irene Early interpreters of Caravaggio's style and themes such as Bartolomeo Manfredi proved an important influence on Caroselli's handling of the Caravaggist themes. Manfredi's interpretation of the singers and musical performers through half- to three-quarter-length figures in cramped, undefined rectangular spaces, imbued with rich coloration and soft chiaroscuro, seems to have left a particular impression on Caroselli. Caroselli's figures were generally less elegant and more earthly than those of Manfredi. Caroselli's depictions of singers and musicians, which likely date from his first period in Rome before 1616, appear in turn to have influenced the Dutch painter Dirck van Baburen's explorations of the same subject matter. Van Baburen's Singing young man (St√§del Museum) has many elements in common with Caroselli's Singing man (Kunsthistorisches Museum) in the pose of the singer holding a score, the fanciful costume with a medallion in the hat and the raised open hand, a feature that traditionally has been associated with the Dutch followers of Caravaggio. Scene of sorcery Caroselli seems to have a preference for the subject of prostitutes and courtisans. Giovanni Battista Passeri recounts that the Caroselli lived with Agostino Tassi so he could enjoy the favours of the courtesans who lived in his house. His paintings of this subject matter therefore depict figures that the painter knew well.Angelo Caroselli, Blind Love: A Man Playing Draughts with a Courtesan at Robilant+Voena As his follower referred to as the Pseudo-Caroselli also often returned to this subject in a style not very unlike that of Caroselli, it has not always been possible to distinguish the work of the two artists in this area. For instance, the Violinist and Courtesan, an Allegory of Love (Sotheby's New York sale of 31 January 2018 lot 15) has traditionally been attributed to Caroselli but, since it also displays the more physical treatment of similar subjects by Pseudo-Caroselli, it could very well be the work of the latter. A fascinating depiction of the theme of paid love by Caroselli can be seen in the Blind love, a man playing draughts with a courtesan (at Robilant+Voena in 2019). This panel shows four people in a room around a table on which a draughts game board and playing cards are placed. A pretty young woman with a pearl pendant and a low-cut dress holding a game piece in her hand, is turning her head towards an old woman with a wrinkly face to her right. The latter holds something in her right hand which may be another game piece or a coin (i.e. the payment for the courtesan's services?). On the opposite side of the table there is a man blindfolded, with long dark hair and beard who is holding coins in his right hand. Behind him appears the head of a fourth figure, probably the putto who blindfolded him. On the wall hangs a painting with a nude reclining female and a Cupid with a bow and quiver in a landscape. The complex iconography of the painting seems to cite from many of the works of Caravaggio such as that of the Cardsharps, the fortune teller in the Capitoline Museums and the Calling of St. Matthew in the Contarelli Chapel in Rome. The scene has many symbolic meanings including those of gambling, deception and love. The blindfolded man in buying the courtesan's favours represents on the one hand, a form of vile, blind love and, at the same time, all those who get involved in the risky game of love. The contrast between old woman and the young courtesan placed next to each other represents an allegory of vanitas, i.e. the theme of the merciless march of life towards old age and ultimately death. The Virgin and Child with Saints Elizabeth and the Infant John the Baptist Various art historians have posited that Caroselli was linked to the circles of the adepts of the secret sciences of magic, occultism and alchemy. There are no written documents to support this suggestion but it is clear from his paintings dealing with themes of the occult that he had a fascination with the subject. Some of the paintings on this topic formerly attributed to him have now been attributed to the anonymous Pseudo-Caroselli. The subject of the Virgin Mary, usually in the company of the child Jesus and saints, appears to have been particularly dear to the artist. At least 29 works treat this subject. The frequency is likely due to the Catholic Counter-Reformation's insistence on the role of the Virgin in its belief system. Most of Caroselli's Virgins are shown in a serene attitude, and, in some cases, smiling and joyful with the child Jesus. This style of representation seems to go back to ways of representing the Virgin in the 16the century and may indicate a rejection by the artist of the emotionality of the Baroque in favour of the Renaissance iconography.

Its place in aviation history is mainly that it was the first in the series of Royal Aircraft Factory designs - several of which played an important role in World War I.  Design and Fate  In 1910 the Army Balloon Factory was not actually authorised to design or build aircraft, but only to repair them. When the remains of a crashed Bl√©riot XII monoplane (nicknamed \\"The Man-Killer\\" owing to its poor handling) belonging to the army were sent from Larkhill to Farnborough for repair, authorisation for a complete reconstruction was sought, and granted.Hare 1990, p. 269.Jarrett Air Enthusiast Forty-two, p. 1. The result was a completely new design. A tractor monoplane became a pusher biplane with large balanced fore-elevators, similar in basic layout to the Wright Flyer, but with a fully covered fuselage. Ailerons were fitted to the top wing, and twin balanced rudders were mounted behind the propeller, but out of its immediate slipstream. The only obvious component of the Bl√©riot that found its way into the new design was its 60 hp (45 kW) E.N.V. Type F engine. The S.E.1 made its first flight, a straight mile in the hands of its designer Geoffrey de Havilland on 11 June 1911. Further flight testing revealed control problems and the area of the front wing/elevator was adjusted to try to bring together the centre of pressure and the hinge line and make the S.E.1 stable in pitch. By the beginning of August the front surface was fixed and carried a conventional trailing edge elevator. An attempt to improve the turning characteristics was made by stripping the side covering of the nacelle to reduce side area. De Havilland continued to fly the S.E.1 until 16 August. On 18 August the aircraft was flown by the inexperienced pilot Lt. Theodore J. Ridge, assistant superintendent at the factory (whose previous experience was chiefly with dirigibles, and had only been awarded his pilot's certificate the day before, and was described as \\"an absolutely indifferent flyer\\").Jarrett 2002, pp. 213‚Äì214. Both de Havilland and a factory engineer warned him against flying it. The combination of the inexperienced pilot and the marginally controllable aircraft proved fatal - while landing, with the engine off, he made a sharp turn; the S.E.1 stalled and spun in, killing Ridge.Flight p741 No attempt to rebuild the S.E.1 was made, and the design was apparently abandoned, no attempt being made to develop it. The S.E.2 of 1913 was a completely different kind of aeroplane - a development of the B.S.1.

Biography She was born into an aristocratic family in Gori, Georgia, then part of Imperial Russia. Eristavi-Khoshtaria began as a teacher in her birthplace, Gori, where she founded a free school for peasant children and later established a women‚Äôs organization Mandilosani (1913-4). She debuted in 1885 when her translation of an Ossetic legend ·Éë·Éî·É°·Éù (Beso) was published. In the 1890s she was encouraged by the popular Georgian writer Akaki Tsereteli to move to Tbilisi to continue her work on original writings. Her first novels, ·Éõ·Éù·Éö·Éò·Éû·É£·Éö ·Éí·Éñ·Éê·Éñ·Éî (On the Slippery Path, 1897) and ·Éë·Éî·Éì·Éò·É° ·É¢·É†·Éò·Éê·Éö·Éò (The Wheel of Fate, 1901), enjoyed recognizable success. Being the first Georgian female writer who set her work from a feminine view and direct it at educated adults, Eristavi-Khoshtaria‚Äôs novels and stories follow one pattern: they trace the career of a Georgian noblewoman, thrown into turmoil of the collapse of the old economic and moral orders in the mid-19th century, defending her ideals of free work and truthful love against a corrupt background and clay-footed heroes. After the Soviet invasion of 1921, she withdrew from literary and public activities and wrote little, except ideologically corrective introductions to reprints of her own works .Rayfield, Donald (2000), The Literature of Georgia: A History: 2nd edition, p. 217.

Morrison was born in western Dalmeny, Scotland the 8th of 10 children to Thomas Morrison (1809-1867) and Ann Geggie (1815-1867). He began a medicine degree at Edinburgh, but suffered from ill health, prompting him to break his studies and visit Australia. He spent two years in Melbourne before returning to Edinburgh to complete his degree. He then undertook post-graduate studies at Glasgow, W√ºrzburg and Vienna. He returned to Australia in 1877 as a medical officer on a migrant ship. He practiced medicine in Melbourne for 15 years, but again ill health prompted him to travel. He visited the South Seas and spend some time living in the New Hebrides, where he collected plants for Ferdinand von Mueller. After returning to Australia, he was appointed the first Government Botanist of Western Australia, holding the position from 1897 to 1906. He produced few papers during this time, but these were considered high quality work. Plant taxa published by him include Acacia densiflora, Acacia longispinea, Angianthus acrohyalinus (hook-leaf angianthus), Calandrinia creethae, Calandrinia schistorhiza, Drosera bulbigena (midget sundew), Drosera occidentalis (western sundew), and Indigofera boviperda. He also collected numerous specimens; for example he collected the type specimens for Eucalyptus ebbanoensis and E. platycorys. Morrison was retrenched in 1906, thereupon returning to medical practice. In 1912 he was appointed assistant botanist to Alfred Ewart at the National Herbarium of Victoria. He died at Cheltenham, Victoria the following year. He bequeathed his herbarium to Edinburgh University, his library to the University of Tasmania, and the remainder of his estate to the University of Melbourne.

The cornerstone was laid August 23, 1846. Rev. Louis Huber, O.S.F., and after him, Rev. B. Hengehold, directed the building of the church.

It raises funds to restore and conserve works of art and architecture in Venice, and to investigate ways to protect them against future risks, particularly rising sea levels. The Fund is also committed to ensuring the sustainability of Venice, acting as a lobby and working to find answers to some of the critical ecological, demographic and socio-economic issues that the city is facing. Its chairman is Jonathan Keates, an author and former teacher at the City of London School before retiring in 2013.Jonathan Keates Art & Archives Rescue Fund (1967‚Äì1971) The Art & Archives Rescue Fund, the predecessor to the Venice in Peril Fund, was created after the great floods in Florence and Venice in 1966. The disaster led to dozens of private citizens donating large sums of money and Sir Ashley Clarke, former British Ambassador to Rome and chairman of the British Italian Society at that time, was asked to chair a committee to raise further funds to help rescue the two cities. This committee was constituted as the Art & Archives Rescue Fund (IAARF) in 1967 and Sir Ashley was supported in his fundraising efforts by Carla Thorneycroft (Italian-born wife of Conservative MP Peter Thorneycroft, later Lord Thorneycroft), and Nathalie Brooke, wife of Humphrey Brooke, the Secretary to the Royal Academy. By the end of July 1967 it was decided that fund-raising activity for Florence should be wound down gradually and that efforts would be redirected to Venice where the serious damage had been to the structure of the city. Venice in Peril Fund (1971‚Äì) In 1971 a new statute was drawn up to replace the IAARF with the trust fund Venice in Peril. The fund went on to raise finance for restoration projects in Venice, publicising the issue through conferences and campaigns. John Julius, Viscount Norwich, joined as Chairman in 1971. The fundraising efforts were helped when, in 1977, Peter Boizot, the founder of Pizza Express, invented the Pizza Veneziana. A percentage of the sale price of every Pizza Veneziana sold is donated to Venice in Peril and by 2014 this initiative had raised ¬£2m. Venice in Peril is proud of this partnership. Anna Somers Cocks who was Chairman from 1999 to 2012 expanded the role of the charity to include research into the environmental and socio-economic threats facing the city. Publications assisted by the fund include The Science of Saving Venice (2004), Flooding and Environmental Challenges for Venice and its Lagoon: State of Knowledge (2005), and The Venice Report (2009). By 2010, the Fund had completed 46 conservation and restoration projects in Venice, including the Gothic Porta della Carta of the Doge's Palace. Three-quarters of its funds have been spent on religious buildings, including the late Gothic church of the Madonna dell'Orto in Cannaregio, the ancient Veneto-Byzantine aisled church of San Nicol√≤ dei Mendicoli, and the 16th century Cappella Emiliani on the cemetery island of San Michele. A new project is the restoration of a hydraulic crane inside the Arsenale, built by Armstrong Mitchell in Newcastle in 1883, one of only two remaining in the world. The water level in Venice has risen 23 cm since 1900 due to a combination of subsidence and the level of the Venice lagoon rising. Venice in Peril organised a symposium in London in 1998 to discuss the risk to low-lying cities, including Venice, as a result of rising sea levels; and funded the creation of a research fellowship at Churchill College, Cambridge from 2001 to 2004 to investigate ways to protect Venice from rising sea levels. A conference was held in Cambridge in 2003, and a book The Science of Saving Venice was published in 2004. In 2010, Venice in Peril initiated a campaign in which it solicited the support of the leading museum directors of the world against the vast advertisements on the Doge's Palace and down the Grand Canal. A photographic tribute was produced by international artists in 2011 to support the fund.

Widely regarded as one of the most enigmatic artists, Carnivale has only nine works that can be definitively attributed to him.\\"Still enigmatic; Fra Carnevale.\\" The Economist, 11 Dec. 2004, p. 82(US). Expanded Academic ASAP, go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=EAIM&sw;=w&u;=duke_perkins&v;=2.1&id;=GALE%7CA129366909‚Å¢=r&asid;=e542c7ad89fc2f97193c81efaa1daf53. Accessed 23 Feb. 2017 Most of these have even been contested as authentic to Carnevale at various points in history. He is cited by a number of names including Bartolomeo di Giovanni Corradini, Bartolomeo Coradini and Fra' Carnevale.  Historical background  Fra Carnevale - The Annunciation, National Gallery of Art, Washington He was born in Urbino, and entered the order of Dominicans in 1449 under the name of Fra‚Äô Carnevale or Carnovale. He was a pupil of the Ferrarese painter Antonio Alberti. Farquhar claims he was the teacher of Giovanni Santi. Between 1445-1446, he worked in the studio of Filippo Lippi in Florence. Then, sometime before 1450, he returned to Urbino and joined San Dominico. Local scholars show evidence of his activities between 1456 and 1488. During this time, he apprenticed with Fra Jacopo Veneto. He was commissioned for the altarpiece at del Corpus Domini, but ended his work on this in 1456. In 1467, local record shows his payment for the Santa Maria della Bella altarpiece. From records, we also know that he was curator of San Cassiano del Cavallino and joined the Confraternit√† di Santa Croce. For centuries, the only reference to Carnevale existed in Giorgio Vasari's \\"The Lives of the Artists.\\" Here, Vasari referred to Carnevale as Carnovale da Urbino, the painter of the altarpiece at Santa Maria della Bella in Urbino as well as the influence behind Bramante's architecture of St. Peter's in Rome. Baldinucci's Dictionary of Masters of Disegno cited Fra Carnevale as a student who was well-known to local scholars with a reputation for excellence in the art of perspective. These scholars also attributed the altarpiece to him. Luigi Lanzi‚Äôs 1787 Storia Pittorica dela Italia discusses Fra Carnevale, noting that ‚ÄúBramante and Raphael studied his work, as nothing better could then be found in Urbino.‚Äù Although he was quite harsh in judgement of the perspective used in the altarpiece, he was equally complimentary of the architecture. He also was an architect for the portals of San Domenico in Urbino, providing a foundation for the use of perspective and emphasis on architecture in his paintings. Carnevale surrounded himself with prominent members of local society including lawyer Guido Bonclerici, vicar general to the Bishop Giovanni Battista Mellini, Ottaviano Ubaldini who held power in the court of Urbino, and Matteo di Cataneis who was close to the Lords of Urbino. His paintings reflect this experience within the elitist culture of his society, even more so than would be expected from the member of a prominent religious order. Within his order, he was a spiritual ascetic given the name ‚Äúcarnevale,‚Äù which means ‚Äúlent.‚Äù  Influences  Carnevale's earliest works showed the influence of Dominico Veneziano. However, based on a payment taken by Fra Carnevale on behalf of Antonio Alberti, the assumption is that he apprenticed with this painter in the 1430s.Christiansen, Keith. \\"Florence: Fillipo Lippi and Fra Carnevale.\\" In Christiansen, Keith, and George Bisacca. From Filippo Lippi to Piero Della Francesca: Fra Carnevale and the Making of a Renaissance Master. New York, NY: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2005. Print. He therefore arrives in Florence in 1445 \\"as a pupil not an apprentice which implies his early training was in the Marshes, possibly under the monk Jacopo Veneto; however another document connects him with Antonio Alberti.\\" Lippi was recognized as ‚Äúa crucible for artistic experiments by ‚Äòthe 1425 generation.‚Äô‚Äù Returning to Urbino, at this time he began an architectural project and brought artists from Florence such as Maso di Bartolomeo and Luca della Robbia. His facial types and technique for articulating drapery folds are recognized from Piero della Francesca. Although his paintings are widely seen as perspectively inaccurate, he uses the motif of architectural backgrounds to his advantage, basing the precision of his style on the influence of his work as an architect. Lomazzo recorded Carnevale as an architect, and the stonework for the cathedral in Urbino is attributed to Carnavale.  Paintings  The painting, \\"The Ideal City,\\" very often referred to in books on the theory and history of urban design and housed at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, is one of three similarly styled paintings and arguably attributed to Fra Carnevale. However, the painting is attributed by others to Francesco di Giorgio Martini, partly due to the latter's greater significance at the Urbino court and because the painting refers to architectural themes he refers to in his architectural treatise derived from Leon Battista Alberti's slightly earlier published treatise.Christoph Luitpold Frommel, The Architecture of the Italian Renaissance, London, Thames and Hudson, 2007, p.59 This painting shows Carnevale‚Äôs strong sense and knowledge of architecture. The linear perspective and the three dimensional details of the building's facades are impeccable, all very much in the style of Carnevale‚Äôs work. Only one of Fra Carnevale's works appears in its original location: in Urbino, Carnevale painted the Federico da Montelfeltro alcove in the Palazzo Ducale. The eight other works attributed to Carnevale include the Santa Maria della Bella altarpiece (also known as the Barberini panels or The Birth of the Virgin), an oblong panel in Palazzo Staccoli, The Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple, The Annunciation, The Coronation of the Virgin with Lippi, The Crucifixion, Saint John the Baptist in the Desert, and A Portrait of Man. Several of these works are often contested in regards to Carnevale's hand-- The Coronation of the Virgin with Lippi, The Crucifixion, Saint John the Baptist in the Desert, and A Portrait of Man all have conflicting opinions regarding their origin. Nonetheless, the 2004 exhibit of Carnevale's works in Milan definitively attributed these nine to the artist friar of Urbino. left The Birth of the Virgin and The Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple, now attributed to Carnevale, are two panels and that are now housed in part in the Metropolitan Museum in New York City and part in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. The panels were part of an altarpiece commissioned on behalf of the Santa Maria della Bella in Urbino in 1467. The altarpiece became known as the Barberini panels when they were taken to Rome by Antonio Barberini in 1632. Both pieces are contemporary in conceptualization while showing humanist- antiquarian interests. The architectural aspects are once again strong and in the forefront and there is great detailing in the Roman style reliefs of the buildings. These reliefs reflect the architecture of the ducal palace at Urbino. The play of light on the draping of the clothing and the shadow and light of the buildings is another signature Carnevale trait. The Birth of the Virgin is non-conventional in its composition as the infant is not in the forefront and the focal point of the painting, while in The Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple Carnevale chooses to place three figures at the high- altar instead of the traditional Jewish priest. The story of the Virgin's life is shown in the reliefs on the buildings while showing symbolism to a pagan past.Daffra, Emanuela. In Search of Fra Carnevale: A 'Painter of High Repute.'\\" In Christiansen, Keith, and George Bisacca. From Filippo Lippi to Piero Della Francesca: Fra Carnevale and the Making of a Renaissance Master. New York, NY: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2005. Print. In 1930, the Barberini panels appeared in the \\"Exhibition of Italian Art\\" at the Royal Academy of London. They were well-received and acclaimed, due in part to their uncertain attribution. The panels were sent together to a 2004 exhibit of Carnevale's works in Milan. At that time, there were only nine pieces definitively attributed to Carnevale, though there is speculation that other works not yet attributed to Carnevale's and that other works exist from Carnevale in private collections. The Milan exhibit included works hypothesized to be from Carnevale in order to prompt theoretical discussion regarding the true attribution. The Annunciation is currently at National Gallery in Washington, DC. This piece shows steep perspective of the buildings as in his other works, bright colors in the buildings and clothing with deep folds and crevices in the cloth. Here again, Carnevale is non-traditional by setting the scene outdoors on a street. A Portrait of a Man, one of the controversial works, looks almost like a Roman relief from one of the buildings in Carnevale‚Äôs other paintings but with color added. The deep, chiseled details of the hair are reminiscent of the painting style used for the heavy undulating fabric in the Barberini panels. The detail of the muscles and veins in the neck is very naturalistic. This painting does, however, lack the usual vibrancy of color that is known in Carnevale‚Äôs work. Controversy surrounded the four pieces, Saint John the Baptist, The Crucifixion, Saint Peter and Saint Francis, regarding whether or not they were from the same altarpiece. The examination of the carpentry of the panels undertaken for the exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum demonstrates that, despite discrepancies in the dimensions of the painted surfaces, the four works are, indeed, from a single polyptych. The Crucifixion had previously been attributed to Giovanni Boccati, Piero della Francesca, and Domenico Veneziano, but since the piece referred more to Lombard art styles versus the Florentine culture of Lippi or Veneziano‚Äôs works, it was in the end attributed to Carnevale. When viewing all four of these panels, we see the dense model-like treatment of the drapery with its deep shadows, yet there is a sensitivity in the manner by which the highlights are painted. Even the rocks in the background of The Crucifixion appear to be made of cloth instead of solid earth.  Drawings  Fra Carnevale - Allegorical scene One drawing now attributed to Fra Carnevale appears as the middle drawing from the bottom part of a page from Vasari‚Äôs Libro de‚Äô Disegni. This drawing was originally attributed to Piero della Francesca, whose works overlapped the latter years of Carnevale‚Äôs productions. This, however, appears to be an anachronism of sorts, as the center drawing appears instead to be from Florence during Fra Carnevale‚Äôs teenage years. The drawing depicts a youth worker in rumpled clothing whose proud stature betrays his misshapen appearance. Stylistically, this youth shows a pouting expression that is a trademark Carnevale caricature as well as the standardized form of Carnevale‚Äôs characterization of the physique and the details of the character‚Äôs dress. Known more for his ability to use shadow and light convincingly, Fra Carnevale failed to produce equally convincing physiology in his human subjects. They instead appear sinuous and the affect is flat rather than alive.Christiansen, Keith. ‚ÄúA Drawing for Fra Carnevale.‚Äù Master Drawings, vol. 31, no. 4, 1993, pp. 363‚Äì367., www.jstor.org/stable/1554082. Libro de‚Äô Disegni contains another drawing likely completed by Fra Carnevale. This depiction of eleven male nudes was originally attributed Domenico Veneziano, but instead was likely completed between 1445 and 1450 when Fra Carnevale apprenticed with Filippo Lippi. Another set of drawings has a more controversial attribution to Fra Carnevale, coming out of Filippo Lippi's Coronation of the Virgin. Within this body of art, there are two reproductions that may possibly have been completed by Fra Carnevale; a woman standing and a monk kneeling. Due to the fact that these are reproductions of other works, the attribution to Fra Carnevale is less certain.

Thompson and produced by Toby Swift. It stars Robert Daws and Duncan Preston as a pair of ill-matched, middle-aged, marginalised Leeds detectives who are consigned to work on cases deemed too trivial for their more high-powered colleagues. Originally named Trueman it began life as a BBC Radio 4 Afternoon Play on 17 April 2002 with Detective Inspector Trueman being called back to work after a nervous breakdown in order to solve a high profile murder case, backed up by Detective Sgt. Riley (Duncan Preston). That play was repeated, followed by three new plays in July 2005. Renamed Trueman and Riley for a relaunch on BBC7 (now BBC Radio 4 Extra) in March 2007, and relocated from Hull to Leeds, the new series saw the pair attempt to solve slightly more everyday crimes, and frequently disagreeing about the best way to proceed. The two men both complement and irritate each other, but each recognizes that he depends on the other. Trueman seems to have no family or friends, while Riley has grandchildren. At the end of series 3 Trueman begins a relationship with the widow of a man whose death he investigated as a cold case. The most recent series was broadcast in 2012 on BBC Radio 4 Extra. It was selected as BBC Drama Download of the Week and also featured on the Danny Baker Show (BBC Radio 5 Live), where Riley was heard discussing the merits of red or brown sauce during the Sausage Sandwich Game.

Muslims often make use of the word ‚Äútewafuq‚Äù to express a God-conscious understanding of a phenomenon fundamental to all events and things. This word has the dictionary meaning of ‚Äúto be correlated to each other in some way‚Äù and ‚Äúto be in a pleasant coherence, correspondence, and conformity with each other.‚Äù Coming somewhat close to this meaning, the English-speaking culture has the expression ‚Äúthis was meant to be‚Äù in the face of events where they felt that a conscious hand was at work behind what was happening. Things or events which are in ‚Äútewafuq‚Äù show an intended, planned, and established order by virtue of their being in a state of correspondence and having a well-proportioned, elegant, and subtle correlation designed to fulfill meaningful and wise goals. It is true that all things in tewafuq indicate and prove that there is absolutely no room for even the tiniest bit of blind chance in the universe. Furthermore, the very observed existence of things or events can in no way be attributed to haphazard, unconscious causes, self-creation or a virtual reign of nature working according to so-called ‚Äúnatural laws.‚Äù As nothing may remain outside the sphere of the administration of Allah‚Äôs Knowledge and Power, so too, nothing may remain outside His Will.An exception to Allah‚Äôs direct interaction is the conscious will of humankind, free but not sovereign. Man is given the ability to choose even if and when there is no external cause by which to do so at the face of many given alternatives. Of course, man might wish something which he is not permitted to obtain, do or control. Amongst all things, be they incremental or a synergistically unified whole, there is always a trace or sign of intention and will. In other words, nothing happens unless Allah Wills it to be so.Actions of humankind are created only if Allah has willed to create that which humankind has chosen. Allah knows all at once, even before creation, what an individual will choose and, accordingly, what and if He will create. Therefore, there is realistically no chance in the universe. In actuality, all sciences aim to uncover the inherent procedures and laws of the fantastic functioning of the universe. All scientific endeavor accepts a priori that the universe and universal laws can in no way be the products of chance occurring every now-and-then out of vanity; it attempts to verify the accepted principle that, in every trace of this vast universe, highly precious goals are sought and excellent signs of wisdom established.< All these facts indicate the existence of tewafuq in the sense that things are in a state of coherence, conformity, and correlation. That is, tewafuk shows or opens a door to the mind that there is One behind the curtain. Indeed, that One is the Unique Sovereign of the Universe. The key to all things are with Him. The reins of all things are in His Hand. All things are settled with His Command. Nothing may act in vain or exist beyond the sphere of the sovereignty of His Will. The Qur‚Äôan -the Book of Wisdom- with all of Its verses mutually interlocked, effectively making the impact of one unique and extraordinary phrase, exemplifies a fantastic manifestation of tewafuq by virtue of the fact that the verses synergistically and coherently preserve the aim of the whole message, even to the extremes of their most infinitesimal. undetectable aspects.

Following a number of name changes, it became the 5th (Princess Charlotte of Wales's) Regiment of Dragoon Guards in 1804. In 1922, it was amalgamated with The Inniskillings (6th Dragoons) to form the 5th/6th Dragoons. Its history and traditions continue today in the Royal Dragoon Guards, a light reconnaissance unit of the British Army. History Vinegar Hill, 1798 On 1 January 1686, several independent troops of horse raised in response to the 1685 Monmouth Rebellion were formed into the Earl of Shrewsbury's Regiment of Horse. After the 1688 Glorious Revolution, it served in the Williamite War in Ireland, including the Battle of the Boyne and the First Siege of Limerick. When the Nine Years' War ended in 1697, the regiment escaped disbandment by being made part of the Irish military establishment, where it remained until the creation of the United Kingdom in 1801. During the War of the Spanish Succession, the unit was commanded by William Cadogan, close aide to the Duke of Marlborough. It was engaged in many of Marlborough's battles and sieges, including Blenheim, Ramillies and Malplaquet; after the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, it resumed garrison duties in Ireland, where it spent most of the next 80 years. Cannon, p. 34 Le Marchant's charge at Salamanca, July 1812; 5th dragoons right foreground Renamed Second Irish Horse in 1746, it then became 5th Regiment of Dragoon Guards in 1788. On the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Warsin 1793, it was posted to Flanders where it fought at the April 1794 Battle of Beaumont. The unit returned to Ireland and helped suppress the 1798 Irish Rebellion, including the battles of Arklow, Vinegar Hill and Ballinamuck. In 1804, it was retitled 5th (Princess Charlotte of Wales's) Regiment of Dragoon Guards after Princess Charlotte, later simplified to 5th (Princess Charlotte of Wales's) Dragoon Guards. 1854 Charge of the Heavy Brigade; photographed ca 1856 Posted to Spain in 1810, it was part of Le Marchant's brigade during the Peninsular campaign. The Battle of Salamanca in July 1812 is considered one of Wellington's greatest victories and Le Marchant's attack as the 'single most destructive charge made by a brigade of cavalry in the whole Napoleonic period.' The regiment celebrated 'Salamanca Day' until its dissolution in 1922; the tradition continues among several units of the modern British army. Redesignated heavy cavalry, it was sent to the Crimean War in 1853 and fought in the October 1854 Battle of Balaclava. The Charge of the Heavy Brigade was a famous action but casualties were relatively light; the Brigade as a whole lost 92 dead and wounded in total, 15 of whom came from the 5th Dragoon Guards. A small detachment joined the 1885 Nile Expedition in 1885 but its next serious action was during the 1899-1902 Second Boer War, when it fought at the battles of Elandslaagte and Ladysmith. During the 1914-1918 War, it formed part of the British Expeditionary Force that landed in France in August 1914. Retitled 5th Dragoon Guards (Princess Charlotte of Wales's) in 1921, the following year it was amalgamated with the Inniskillings (6th Dragoons), to form 5th/6th Dragoons.

It is ‚Äúthe system through which research and other scholarly writings are created, evaluated for quality, disseminated to the scholarly community, and preserved for future use.\\" This primarily involves the publication of peer- reviewed academic journals, books and conference papers. There are many issues with scholarly communication, which include author rights, the peer review process, the economics of scholarly resources, new models of publishing (including open access and institutional repositories), rights and access to federally funded research and preservation of intellectual assets. Methods Common methods of scholarly communication include publishing peer-reviewed articles in academic journals, academic monographs and books, book reviews and conference papers. Other textual formats used include preprints and working papers, reports, encyclopedias, dictionaries, data and visualisations, blogs and discussion forums. Other forms, particularly in the arts and humanities include multimedia formats such as sound and video recordings.  Scholarly communication crisis  The term \\"scholarly communications\\" has been in common usage at least since the mid-1970s, in recent years there has been widespread belief that the traditional system for disseminating scholarship has reached a state of crisis (often referred to as the \\"publishing crisis\\" or \\"serials crisis\\") The proliferation of new journals and the \\"twigging\\" of established journals into smaller sub-specialities, combined with rising prices, especially in the sciences, have dramatically reduced the capacity of research libraries to purchase resources required by their scholarly communities. All disciplines and formats are affected, the humanities and social sciences as well as the sciences, books as well as journals. The proliferation of electronic journals and the various pricing models for this information has further complicated the acquisitions issue, both for libraries and for publishers. Many groups, including library consortia, research funders, academics and universities have been calling for changes to the ways scholarly communication takes place, particularly in light of the Internet creating new and low cost methods to disseminate research, while still maintaining a 'peer review' process to ensure that the quality of research is maintained. To advance research in this area and to produce sustainable publication tools, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has funded a cohort of projects based on university campuses and at academic presses \\"to change scholarly practice in ways that advance teaching, research, preservation, and publication.\\"Scholarly Communications  The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. (n.d.). Retrieved May 9, 2017, from https://mellon.org/programs/scholarly-communications/ Recent technological developments, such as open access and institutional repositories at universities are seen as vehicles for changing or improving the scholarly communication process. Chief among the factors contributing to the perceived crisis is the academic reward system, which emphasizes quantity of publication. There is a consequent demand by scholars for peer-reviewed publication outlets. Another important cause is the commercialization and internationalization of scholarly publishing. The growing dominance of publishing conglomerates in scientific, technical, and medical fields, and to some degree in the social sciences, is of special concern to information professionals. Scholars, often indifferent to rights issues, transfer copyright to for-profit publishers, frequently for reports of research funded wholly or partially at public expense. Commercial publishers have established a highly profitable niche for themselves in the scholarly communication chain.  Scholarly communication and academic reward and reputation  Scholarly communication is seen as a crucial part of research, and researchers - many of whom are lecturers and academics at universities - are often judged by their academic output and list of publications. Promotions will normally take into account the number of publications and how prestigious the journals they were published in (e.g. Nature and The Lancet are seen as very prestigious journals within the sciences). A researcher's publication list will help them create a positive reputation within their discipline. The proliferation of open access journals has facilitated this process by providing a means for scholars to publish their research regardless of perceived importance, as is the case with traditional journals. Publications such as PLOS ONE and Scientific Reports follow an author pay model, where the peer review and publishing service are provided for a one time cost to the writer. The material is then made available at no cost to others, who can then build on this research without limitation. This approach results in the acceptance and publishing of a greater percentage of submissions across a broader subject area.  Scholarly communication and libraries  Libraries and librarians play a critical role in the aggregation, evaluation and dissemination of scholarly communication. The Scholarly Communication Toolkit was designed by the Research and Scholarly Environment Committee of the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) to support advocacy efforts designed to transform the scholarly communication landscape. The future of research libraries will be shaped by broader developments at research universities in the areas of creating, sharing, disseminating, and curating knowledge. Universities face fundamental policy choices in all of the areas that have been recast by developments in information technology. Current trends in digital scholarship practices across the humanities, science, and social science have significant implications for research libraries in academic institutions as a means of framing policy choices. Many research libraries have formalized the role of Scholarly Communications Librarian and defined specific responsibilities, including the implementation of outreach programs to increase awareness relative to copyright (particularly section 108 of the US Copyright Act), open access, and other scholarly communication issues. Through these types of programs, librarians have established their role relative to the structure of the library organization by formalizing the discussion of these issues in research and e-learning activities. They also contribute in teaching copyright literacy by being active in all stages of the research process.

This need has resulted in the development of a new form of scholarly communication known as data publishing. The process involves making data accessible, reusable and citable for long term use and is more elaborate than simply providing access to a data file. Data is becoming an important element of scholarship as a sharable source to be reused and shared. The same data can be accessed by multiple researchers to ask new questions or to replicate research for verification and augmentation. Categories of data differ among disciplines, as does its accessibility. Many publications have begun to offer incentives to scholarly researchers to publish their data and have developed the necessary infrastructure in support of e-research. Technical, policy, and institutional factors are becoming more established. The next phase will see the integration of the process into a standardized data publishing methodology. There are several types of data that researchers must to protect when collecting, handling, storing and sharing data to safeguard the confidentiality of contributors. There are three primary types of information. Personally identifiable information includes any data that allows the identity of an individual to whom the information applies to be realistically deduced by either direct or indirect means. Protected health information includes individually identifiable health information transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity. Other sensitive information that should be protected include data that if it were disclosed would have a significant likelihood to cause psychological, social, emotional, physical, or reputation harm. A common approach for data sharing that includes confidential material is through de-identification or anonymization. There are numerous techniques for the de-identification of data including simply removing specific variables or by using statistical techniques such as top- coding, collapsing or combining, sampling, swapping, or disturbing the data. For qualitative data, redaction can be used to hide data elements that cannot be made public. However, it is important that future research requirements be taken into consideration when developing a de-identification or anonymization plan.  Peer review and quality control  A key element of the scholarly communication process is ensuring that research meets a level of quality and is of scholarly merit. This is normally done through a process of peer review, where other researchers in the same discipline review the research write up and decide if it is of sufficient quality. For example, in the case of a journal article, the author(s) of a piece of research will submit their article to a journal, it will then be sent to a number of other academics who specialize in the same area to be peer reviewed. The journal will often receive many more articles than there is space to publish them, and it is in their interest to publish only those of the highest quality (which will over time increase the reputation of the journal). If the reviewers feel the article is of a high enough quality for the journal, they will often request some changes to be made and once these are done, accept the article for publication.

The abbey was founded in 1142 and became an important pilgrimage stop on the Way of St. James en route to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. The abbey is situated at the confluence of the Luz and the Arros rivers near the Ch√¢teau de Mauvezin. In the middle of the 12th century, a group of monks under the protection of the count of Bigorre who lived at Cabadur in the Gripp valley in the modern-day commune of Campan, near Bagn√®res-de-Bigorre, wanted to move to a more hospitable location and therefore establish the abbey at Bonnemazon. The abbey became the center of the expansion of southern French Cistercian expansion and founded eight abbeys in Spain (including ones in Fitero, Sacram√©nia, and V√©ru√©la) and two in Gascony (Flaran Abbey and Bouillas Abbey). The abbey was continuously inhabited by Cistercian monks until 1830 when it sold to an unknown local family. In 1986, the abbey was purchased by the Conseil G√©n√©ral des Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es which undertook its restoration.

The screenplay by William Wheeler is based on the book of the same title by Clifford Irving. It recounts Irving's elaborate hoax of publishing an autobiography of Howard Hughes that he purportedly helped write, without ever having talked with Hughes. The film was ranked as one of the Top 10 of the year by the Los Angeles Times and Newsweek. The screenplay was considerably different from the book. Hired as a technical adviser to the film, Irving was displeased with the product and later asked to have his name removed from the credits. Plot In 1971, publishing executives at McGraw-Hill express an interest in Clifford Irving's novel, Rudnick's Problem. Fake!, his previous book about art forger Elmyr de Hory, had sold poorly. Irving believes he has a breakout work, but the publisher decides against releasing the book after a Life editor deems it unsatisfactory. Vacationing with his friend and researcher Richard Suskind, Irving is ejected from his hotel at 1 a.m, after eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes arrives and demands the entire building be vacated. Returning to New York City to meet with his publishers, Irving finds he has been reduced to meeting with an assistant. Irving storms into the board room, says his new project will be the \\"book of the century\\", and threatens to take it elsewhere. He struggles to come up with a topic fit for his grandiose claim. Seeing a cover story on Hughes, he decides to make him the subject. Irving tells McGraw-Hill that Hughes has recruited him to help write his autobiography, and shows forged handwritten notes from Hughes as proof. Handwriting experts confirm the notes as genuine, and the publishers strike a $500,000 deal for the book. Irving believes that the reclusive Hughes is unlikely to sue him, and that his eccentricities can be used to deflect any denials of authenticity for the book. At the time Irving is having marital problems with his artist wife Edith; he has had an affair. Irving assures Edith he will be faithful as he leaves to begin research with Suskind. To fool experts, the two men devote days to studying documents pertaining to Hughes. They illicitly obtain a copy of a draft biography of Noah Dietrich, a retired Hughes aide, which provides details that add to the apparent authenticity of their work. Irving recites passages into a tape recorder while in character as Hughes, dressing like the millionaire and adding a mustache during these sessions. As work on the book progresses, Irving receives a box containing scandalous material about questionable dealings between Hughes and President Richard Nixon. He believes that Hughes sent the package and convinces himself that Hughes wants this damaging material included in the book, as a sign he supports the work. As the publication date draws near, Irving elaborates his hoax, staging an \\"aborted\\" meeting between Hughes and the publishers. Hughes has officially denied that he is involved in the work, but the McGraw-Hill executives are convinced it is genuine. They begin to think it will be a bestseller, and Irving works to gain larger payments for himself and (purportedly) Hughes. Irving and Edith concoct a scheme for her to deposit Hughes' check, payable to \\"H. R. Hughes\\", into a Swiss bank account using a forged passport with the name \\"Helga R. Hughes.\\" The continuing drama makes Irving increasingly paranoid. He has alcohol-fueled fantasies about being kidnapped by Hughes' people. His affair with Van Pallandt continues, and the pressure of keeping up a pretense of fidelity with his wife adds to his stress. In what is implied to be a favor to Nixon, Hughes goes public via a televised conference call and denies any knowledge of Irving or the book. Irving is arrested and agrees to cooperate if Edith is granted immunity. At a press conference, a government spokesman announces that Irving, Edith, and Suskind have received short jail sentences. An overheard radio report details a sudden wave of legal decisions in favor of Hughes. Irving believes this indicates that his book had been used to place the president in debt to Hughes. A fleeting scene set inside the Nixon White House suggests that Nixon's preoccupation with Hughes led directly to the burglary and wiretapping of Democratic Headquarters at the Watergate Hotel. Historians and political analysts dispute this.\\"Watergate Aviator connection\\", CBS News Cast * Milton Buras as Howard Hughes * Richard Gere as Clifford Irving * Alfred Molina as Richard Suskind * Marcia Gay Harden as Edith Irving * Hope Davis as Andrea Tate * Julie Delpy as Nina van Pallandt * Stanley Tucci as Shelton Fisher * Eli Wallach as Noah Dietrich * Christopher Evan Welch as Albert Vanderkamp * Peter McRobbie as George Gordon Holmes * ≈Ωeljko Ivanek as Ralph Graves Production Portions of the film were shot in the Coachella Valley, California. ‚ô¶ Download (Downloadable PDF file) Irving was hired by the producers as technical adviser. The screenplay was changed considerably from the book, and Irving was unhappy with the result. He said, \\"after reading the final script I asked that my name be removed from the movie credits.\\"CliffordIrving.com Critical reception A.O. Scott of The New York Times said the film was \\"for the most part a jumpy, suspenseful caper, full of narrow escapes, improbable reversals and complicated intrigue. But it has a sinister, shadowy undertow, an intimation of dread that lingers after Irving‚Äôs game is up.\\" Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said the film was \\"an unexpectedly satisfying fantasia of reality and imagination, a meditation on the nature of lies and deception, on how we come to embrace not the truth but what it suits us to believe ... sharply written ... and gracefully directed.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone rated the film 3 1‚ÅÑ2 out of four stars and described it as a \\"devilish and devastating satire.\\" He added, \\"Gere gives 'em the old razzle-dazzle with his roguish charm and sharp comic timing. The surprise is the unexpected feeling he brings to this challenging role.\\"Rolling Stone review Deborah Young of Variety describe the film as a \\"breezy, fast- paced, somewhat loose-ended account [that] offers a surprisingly layered vehicle for a maniacally conniving Richard Gere, backed up by a superb Alfred Molina as his accomplice.\\" The film was ranked as one of the Top 10 of the year by the Los Angeles Times and Newsweek. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has received an 86% positive rate, based on 152 reviews. The site's consensus states: \\"The Hoax is an enormously appealing film, thanks to the uniformly excellent performances and Lasse Hallstr√∂m's zippy direction.\\" While on Metacritic, the film scored 70 out of 100, based on 37 reviews. Box office The Hoax was given a limited opening in 235 theaters in the United States and Canada on April 6, 2007 and earning $1,449,320 on its opening weekend. It eventually grossed $7,164,995 in the US and Canada and $4,607,188 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $11,772,183. Accolades The London Film Critics Circle nominated Alfred Molina for British Supporting Actor of the Year, and Richard Gere was nominated for the Satellite Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Comparison to book and persons While the major events portrayed did take place, the film takes several dramatic liberties. It eliminates all scenes from the book set in Ibiza, where Irving owned a farmhouse and wrote much of the book. The author described the film as \\"a historically cockeyed story\\" and decried its characterizations as inaccurate. He was unhappy with being portrayed as \\"desperate and humorless, a washed-up hack writer who lives in a conservative New York suburb.\\" Irving observed, \\"The movie misses the point that the Howard Hughes hoax was a live-action adventure story concocted by two middle-aged hippie expat writers and a Swiss heiress. Edith, my then-wife, a woman of great zest, is portrayed as a dull hausfrau, and Nina van Pallandt, my Danish mistress, as barely one level above a New York hotel hooker. Dick Suskind, witty friend and co-conspirator, is offered to the public as a self-righteous, sweaty buffoon. The scenes that deal with Movie Clifford feuding with Movie Dick, getting him drunk and hiring a bargirl to seduce him, are totally fictional. The Hughes people mailing the package of files to me is also made up.\\" Films related to Hughes *The Carpetbaggers (1964) *Diamonds are Forever (1971) *F for Fake (1974) *The Amazing Howard Hughes (1977; TV movie) *Melvin and Howard (1980) *Tucker: The Man and His Dream (1988) *The Rocketeer (1991) *The Aviator (2004) ReferencesExternal links * * * Category:2006 films Category:2006 biographical drama films Category:American films Category:American biographical drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films about writers Category:Drama films based on actual events Category:Films directed by Lasse Hallstr√∂m Category:Films set in 1971 Category:Films shot in California Category:Films shot in New Jersey Category:Films shot in New York (state) Category:Films shot in Puerto Rico Category:Hoaxes in fiction Category:Howard Hughes Category:Films about con artists Category:Films scored by Carter Burwell Category:Films about fraud Category:Cultural depictions of Howard Hughes Category:2006 drama films ","title":"The Hoax"},{"id":"10370707","text":"Mary Emma \\"May\\" Manning Lillie (March 12, 1869 ‚Äì September 17, 1936) was an American sharpshooter and equestrian. Biography Mary Manning was born on March 12, 1869, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her parents were physician William R. and Mary Manning. May had two sisters, Elmira, and Elizabeth Manning and a younger brother, William B. Manning. May also had three half- brothers: Samuel, Edward and Albert Eager. May met Gordon William Lillie who became famous as Pawnee Bill while attending Smith College in 1886, they married at her parents‚Äô home in Philadelphia later that year. Gordon Lillie's wedding gift to his bride was a pony and a Marlin .22 target rifle. In 1887 May debuted at a sharpshooter for Pawnee Bill's Great Wild West Show and was billed as 'the greatest Lady Horseback Rifle-shot of the World'. May traveled the country with her husband's show and was one of the first women to perform as an equestrian and shooter in American Wild West shows. May suffered a shooting injury during an act in 1899 that required two of her fingers to be amputated.Browder (2009), p. 85. While on tour in 1907, May gave a speech to women in Chicago, she said: \\"Let any normally healthy woman who is ordinarily strong screw up her courage and tackle a bucking bronco, and she will find the most fascinating pastime in the field of feminine athletic endeavor. There is nothing to compare, to increase the joy of living, and once accomplished, she‚Äôll have more real fun than any pink tea or theater party or ballroom ever yielded.\\" Eventually, May and Gordon settled in Pawnee, Oklahoma, on Blue Hawk Peak. They built a cabin, established a buffalo herd, and, in 1910, completed work on their Arts and Crafts style home. In 1917, May and Gordon adopted a son whom they named Billy. He died in an accident at the ranch in 1925. While her husband was on tour, May was the hands-on manager of the Lillie buffalo ranch. She believed in the buffalo‚Äôs importance to the heritage of the American West and to Plains Indian culture. May was active in the Woman's Relief Corps and was a member of the Eastern Star. She starred in \\"May Lillie, Queen of the Buffalo Ranch,\\" a film produced at the ranch.Bricklin (2017), p. 141. In 1936 she and her husband celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary in Taos, New Mexico. In September of that year, they attended a local celebration in Tulsa, Oklahoma. While driving back to their ranch that night Gordon lost control of their vehicle. May died on September 17, 1936, as a result of injuries sustained in the accident. In 2011, May Lillie was inducted into the National Cowgirl Hall of Fame for her tireless work during her Wild West show career as well as her role in the preservation of the American bison.

It was created as an open- source Napster server, extending the Napster protocol to allow sharing of any media type, and adding the ability to link servers together. History The original Napster peer-to-peer file sharing service was a protocol which allowed users to transfer files directly between their clients. The protocol was reverse engineered by a developer nicknamed Drscholl and several other programmers. The first OpenNap servers appeared in 1999, operating in the same manner as Napster servers did. A client program connects to a centralized OpenNap server, search for, share and download files. The OpenNap server keeps track of all available files and provides clients the ability to search the index of available files and initiate a direct transfer between the clients. The files available via OpenNap servers are stored on the clients, never passing through the server. In addition, instant messages (private chat) and group chat services similar to IRC are also available. OpenNap servers can be interconnected with each other, to form OpenNap networks. In order to find as many files as possible, many clients connected to multiple OpenNap networks. In 2000-2001 an indexing service for all OpenNap servers was created, called Napigator. Napigator allowed server administrators to add their server to a central list, so they could be easily (and often automatically) found by client software. Recent state As the RIAA began to successfully dismantle Napster in the end of 2000, the population of OpenNap began to surge. Even though it appeared OpenNap would become the next Napster, it suffered from the same vulnerability as Napster: centralized servers. When the RIAA finally dismantled Napster in 2001, it then aimed its focus on OpenNap. During OpenNap's peak in February 2002, the RIAA on behest of its member companies, began sending ‚ÄúCease and Desist‚Äù notices to the biggest OpenNap networks. One by one, the networks began to collapse and OpenNap was reduced from a population of over 250,000 to little more than 50,000 in less than five months. There are still some private and public opennap servers operating.http://archive.winmxworld.com/WSX%20Files/http://notban.bbs.fc2.com/http://serverlist.run.buttobi.net/http://kujira2k.tripod.com/http://endless.dyndns.info/ Clients still available * audioGnomehttp://www.audiognome.com/ * FileScope * jNapsterhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/jnapster/ * Lopsterhttp://lopster.sourceforge.net/ (or WinLop, the Windows port) * SunshineUNhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/sunshineun/ * TekNap (an opennap port of BitchX) * Utatane (P2P) * WinMX List of historic client software * FileNavigatorhttps://web.archive.org/web/20050720134206/http://www.filenavigator.com/ * FileShare * MyNapster * Napigator (enabled the original Napster client to connect to opennap servers) * Rapigator ReferencesExternal links *Official homepage on SourceForge *A Fork of the original OpenNap on Sourceforge Category:File sharing software Category:File sharing networks Category:1999 software Category:Software using the GPL license ","title":"OpenNap"},{"id":"10370738","title":"Utah statistical areas"},{"id":"10370760","text":"Cardinal O'Brien may refer to: * Edwin Frederick O'Brien, age , American cardinal and grand master of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre and former archbishop of Baltimore. * Keith O'Brien, (1938-2018), disgraced Scottish cardinal and former archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh.

The film is based on a novel by Indro Montanelli which was in turn based on a true story. Plot Genoa, 1944, during the era of the Italian Social Republic. Petty thief Emmanuele Bardone (played by Vittorio De Sica) is hired by the Third Reich to impersonate an Italian resistance leader, General Della Rovere, and infiltrate a group of resistance prisoners in a Milan prison. Gradually, Bardone loses himself in his role and not merely pretends to be a hero of the resistance but actually becomes one, first encouraging his fellow prisoners to show courage and eventually accepting death by firing squad rather than betraying another imprisoned resistance leader.

It was built in the early 17th century, and was extensively remodelled in 1885. The house remained in private hands until 1938, when it was acquired by the Air Ministry, and became RAF Pitreavie Castle. The RAF station closed in 1996, and the building was converted into residential apartments. History South front of Pitreavie Castle, drawn in the 19th century by MacGibbon and Ross, prior to the alterations of the 1880s The Pitreavie estate was owned by Lady Christina Bruce, sister of Robert the Bruce, in the 14th century, and by the early 17th century, it was owned by the Kello (or Kellock) family. Henry Wardlaw of Balmule (later Sir Henry Wardlaw, 1st Baronet of Pitreavie) bought the estate in 1608 for 10,000 merks Scottish. Wardlaw was Chamberlain to Queen Anne, wife of James VI of Scotland. When James acceded to the English throne in 1603 and travelled south to London, he left Dunfermline Palace in Wardlaw's care. Henry Wardlaw became a Baronet of Nova Scotia in 1631, and died in 1637, succeeded by his eldest son, also Henry. Wardlaw's granddaughter, Elizabeth Wardlaw, was the reputed author of the poem Hardyknute and the ballad Sir Patrick Spens. Wardlaw began to construct the house in 1615. It was originally built to a U-shaped plan, with a symmetrical layout comprising a rectangular main body about long, two short wings projecting to north, and spiral staircases rising up both interior angles. The roof originally had crow steps on the gables and dormer windows, with the only entrance on the inner side of the west wing: a matching door in the east wing led down to a blind cellar. There were only small windows on the ground floor. Pitreavie is considered to be an important example of an early 17th-century symmetrically-planned house, in the style of Sir James Murray, the King's Master of Works, and is similar to his Baberton House of the 1620s. The grounds were planted as a wilderness in the late 17th century, with acres of ash, birch and elm trees. During the invasion of Scotland by Oliver Cromwell, the Battle of Pitreavie was fought nearby on 20 July 1651, between an English force commanded by Colonel Robert Overton and a Scottish force, including some 800 Highlanders from the Clan Maclean. After the battle, which was a decisive victory for the Cromwellian forces (contemporary reports speak of 2,000 Scots killed and 1,600 captured, all for the loss of 8 of Overton's troops), a group of Macleans sought refuge in the house, but cursed the Wardlaw family when they were refused sanctuary. =Alterations= The house was sold to Archibald Primrose, 1st Earl of Rosebery, in 1703, and then to Sir Robert Blackwood, Lord Dean of Guild, and later Lord Provost, of Edinburgh, in 1711. It remained in the Blackwood family for 170 years, but was unoccupied for almost a century. The castle was bought by Henry Beveridge, a wealthy mill owner, in 1884, when it was extended and modernised. He commissioned the architect Charles Kinnear in 1885 to add an east wing, insert larger windows on the ground floor, and add a portico to the north, leading to a new main entrance. The additions were detailed in a similar Scottish Renaissance style. The grounds were also renovated, with a water garden and a narrow-gauge railway. Two entrance lodges were also built; the East Lodge survives, but the western one was demolished. =RAF Pitreavie Castle= Pitreavie House in 2011 Beveridge died in 1922, and the castle was sold to the Air Ministry in 1938 for ¬£12,306, who added a concrete outbuilding housing kitchens, a bar and a dining room, a bunker, and other outbuildings. The castle was used to coordinate operations of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force Coastal Command. Other buildings added when the castle was the home of RAF Pitreavie Castle have been demolished. After the Second World War, Pitreavie Castle became the headquarters of the NATO North Atlantic Area, home of the commanders of air forces (No. 18 Group RAF) and of naval forces in the North Atlantic, and the home of the Air Officer Scotland and Northern Ireland (AOSNI). The base closed in 1996, and its role as a maritime rescue co-ordination centre was moved to RAF Kinloss. The castle has now been converted into several apartments with most of the surviving grounds developed as private housing and the Carnegie Campus business park. The castle is now a category A listed building.

MacDonald was appointed by former Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton on 3 May 2004 and resigned on 1 May 2007 after an internal investigation found that she had \\"injected herself personally and profoundly in a number of Endangered Species Act decisions\\", a violation of the Code of Federal Regulations under Use of Nonpublic Information and Basic Obligation of Public Service, Appearance of Preferential Treatment.  Biography  MacDonald graduated from University of California, Davis in 1978 with a degree in civil engineering. She joined the Department of the Interior in 1979 as a hydraulic engineer with the Bureau of Reclamation. Starting in 1987, MacDonald worked as a government administrator, including at the California Resources Agency.REPORT OF INVESTIGATION: Julie MacDonald, Deputy Assistant Secretary, Fish, Wildlife and Parks MacDonald returned to the U.S. Department of the Interior in 2002 as an aide to the assistant secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, the official who oversees the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Park Service, two of the eight bureaus in the Department of the Interior. On 3 May 2004, Interior Secretary Gale Norton promoted MacDonald to be deputy assistant secretary for fish and wildlife and parks in the Department of the Interior.  Events leading to resignation  On 30 October 2006, the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit politically active group that advocates for scientific integrity, alleged that MacDonald had \\"personally reversed scientific findings, changed scientific conclusions to prevent endangered species from receiving protection, removed relevant information from a scientific document, and ordered the Fish and Wildlife Service to adopt her edits.\\" That year, the Department of the Interior Inspector General Earl E. Devaney undertook an investigation into the allegations against MacDonald. In March 2007, Devaney issued his report of that investigation, leveling charges of misconduct against MacDonald. Although Devaney's investigation did not find evidence of illegal activity, his two chief conclusions were that MacDonald had repeatedly violated the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.), Use of Nonpublic Information and Basic Obligation of Public Service, Appearance of Preferential Treatment by giving nonpublic, internal government documents to oil industry and property rights groups, and that MacDonald had manipulated and undermined scientific findings in order to favor the George W. Bush administration's policy goals and assist land developers. Report: Interior official blasted for twisting environmental data According to the Inspector General, \\"MacDonald has been heavily involved with editing, commenting on, and reshaping the Endangered Species Program's scientific reports from the field.\\" MacDonald resigned on 1 May 2007, one week before a House congressional oversight committee was to hold a hearing on the Inspector General's findings. MacDonald commented that she resigned due to public pressure. In November 2007, a follow-up report by the Inspector General found that MacDonald could have benefited financially from a decision to remove the Sacramento splittail fish from the federal endangered species list. The Washington Post called the events leading to MacDonald's resignation \\"the latest in a series of controversies in which government officials and outside scientists have accused the Bush administration of overriding or setting aside scientific findings that clashed with its political agenda.\\" In the aftermath of her departure, many endangered species decisions issued during her tenure were reversed.  Aftermath  The Inspector General's findings led the Fish and Wildlife Service to reopen endangered species decisions made under MacDonald's supervision. The agency's director H. Dale Hall, called MacDonald's conduct \\"a blemish on the scientific integrity of the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of the Interior.\\" Hall reopened the agency's assessment of the southwest willow flycatcher after alleging that MacDonald had told field personnel to reduce the bird's natural nesting range from 2.1 miles to 1.8 miles. Hall also told the inspector general that MacDonald had altered range estimates for the willow flycatcher because a critical habitat designation might impact family property in California. However, MacDonald maintained that the property is nearly 300 miles from flycatcher habitat, and that her alteration of the bird‚Äôs range was approved by agency experts, including Hall, a former wildlife biologist. Eight other endangered species decisions were reopened, including the white-tailed prairie dog, Preble's meadow jumping mouse, arroyo toad, California red-legged frog, and the Canada lynx. In November 2007, the FWS announced that of the eight species reviewed, seven had been returned to endangered status. In December 2007, the US District Court for the District of Idaho overturned the FWS rejection of a petition to list the sage grouse as threatened and endangered, citing misconduct by MacDonald. In its decision, the court wrote that \\"The FWS decision was tainted by the inexcusable conduct of one of its own executives...who was neither a scientist nor a sage-grouse expert, had a well- documented history of intervening in the listing process.\\" In 2010, after a second review, the Department of the Interior assigned the bird a status known as \\"warranted but precluded,\\" essentially putting the bird on the waiting list (behind more critically threatened species) for endangered species protection. Even though the sage grouse was not added to the endangered species list, the 2010 decision essentially reversed MacDonald's 2004 ruling, in which the Department of the Interior claimed that the bird was not threatened. The New York Times characterized the decision made under her leadership as \\"tainted by political tampering\\". In September 2008, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed to more than triple the habitat of the California red-legged frog. The 2008 decision ignored that which was reached under MacDonald, due to \\"the involvement of Department of Interior personnel which may have inappropriately influenced the extent and locations of critical habitat\\". According to the LA Times, \\"The agency revisited the original habitat designation, citing scientific miscalculations and political manipulation by a former Interior Department official, Julie MacDonald.\\" A December 2008 report by Inspector General Devaney found that MacDonald had interfered with 13 of the 20 endangered species rulings that were reevaluated.New Report Finds More Than a Dozen Endangered Species Rulings Compromised by Former Interior Department Political Appointee In a letter to U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests, Devaney said, \\"MacDonald injected herself personally and profoundly in a number of ESA decisions. We determined that MacDonald's management style was abrupt and abrasive, if not abusive, and that her conduct demoralized and frustrated her staff as well as her subordinate managers.\\" Wyden, who commissioned the report, said \\"This report makes it crystal clear how one person‚Äôs contempt for the public trust can infect an entire agency...[MacDonald caused] significant harm to the integrity of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and...untold waste of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers' dollars.\\"Wyden-Requested IG Report on Interior Corruption Uncovers \\"Contempt for the Public Trust\\" and \\"Untold Waste\\" - Senator praises Devaney's investigation into political interference in ESA decisions.  Post-government positions  Between 2009 and 2013, MacDonald spent at least $530,000 as a lobbyist on endangered-species issues, and was co-author of a commentary on the Endangered Species Act in the December 27, 2013 edition of the Wall Street Journal.

Stephen Martin Leake (5 April 1702 ‚Äì 24 March 1773) was a numismatist and long-serving officer of arms at the College of Arms in London. Early life Though he eventually rose to the highest rank in the College, he was born as Stephen Martin and was the only son of Captain Stephen Martin, a naval officer, and his wife, Elizabeth. A relative left his considerable estate to Captain Martin on condition that he and his family adopt the additional name and arms of Leake. Shortly after the inheritance was completed in 1721, the family lost more than ¬£20,000. The younger Leake was then holding a clerkship in the Navy Office, but the loss necessitated a search for a better position. His father attempted to buy a post in the Treasury but failed. Leake was admitted to Middle Temple and made a younger brother of Trinity House in 1723. In 1724 he became a deputy lieutenant for Tower Hamlets. Early successes In 1725, the Order of the Bath was \\"revived\\" in Britain. Garter Principal King of Arms, Sir John Anstis arranged for Leake to be made an esquire to one of the knights. Anstis had met Leake while working with his family on the Royal Licence to change the family's name. The knight to whom Leake was attached was the Earl of Sussex, deputy Earl Marshal. In March 1726 Leake was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. He also published his essay Nummi Britannici Historia in that year covering the history of English coinage. This work was reissued in several editions during Leake's life. Heraldic career Leake had made many powerful connections, but still lacked an appointment that would provide for his needs. Leake tried to use John Anstis to obtain a position at the College of Arms. Anstis used the opportunity of Leake's request to secure an appointment as Garter for his own son. After being embarrassed by Anstis, Leake assumed that he would be able to gain sympathy in other circles. In 1727 his connections gained him a spot as Lancaster Herald of Arms in Ordinary at the College. He was promoted Norroy King of Arms in December 1729. As a herald and king of arms, Leake directed his energy toward improving the fortunes of the College of Arms. In 1729 he applied to the attorney general for the prosecution of a painter‚Äìstainer who offered to research arms for customers. This suit was unsuccessful, but he also sought a new charter for the college that would have confirmed its monopoly on these activities. He also attempted to revive heraldic visitations in 1731 and 1744. His Reasons for Granting Commissions to the Provincial Kings of Arms for Visiting their Provinces was printed in 1744. This, like most of his other projects failed. It was impeded both by Anstis as Garter and by the government. In 1732 Leake was also engaged in the attempted revival of the High Court of Chivalry. After five years nothing had been accomplished, so the court closed. It did sit again until 1954. Though he was not successful in most of these endeavors, he was able to raise the awareness and prestige of the College in England. Leake was promoted to Clarenceux King of Arms in 1741 and Garter Principal King of Arms in 1754. He immediately became deeply involved in the Order of the Garter, for which the office is named. He worded with the Dean of Windsor to bring the official registers up to date. He also compiled a collection of drawings of knights' stall plates from St George's Chapel, and travelled abroad to invest foreign princes with the Garter. Though Leake was always a vocal critic of the patronage and purchase by which heralds were appointed, he did have his thirteen-year-old son, John Martin Leake, appointed Chester Herald of Arms in Ordinary in 1752. Personal life In 1735 Leake married Anne, daughter of Fletcher Powell, a brewer. They had six sons and three daughters, all of whom survived their father. Powell's estate in Hertfordshire later passed to Leake's descendants. Leake himself lived in Mile End, where he was active in vestry affairs and helped raise volunteer units during the Jacobite rising of 1745, and at Thorpe-le-Soken in Essex, where his father had acquired an estate in 1720. By 1770 he was suffering badly from gout and rheumatism and he died at Mile End on 24 March 1773. He was buried in Thorpe-le-Soken church.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 597. Largely bypassed by the A4304 road, the village consists of a mix of old and new housing and includes a primary school and the parish church of St. Andrew's dating from the 13th century. At the time of the Domesday survey (1086) there were two settlements Chivelesworde and Cleveliorde, both belonging to the vill of Stanford-on-Avon across the border in Northamptonshire; they were given by Guy de Reinbudcurt to Benedict, founding abbot of Selby, Yorkshire later differentiated into North and South Kilworth. In -iorde can be immediately recognized yard, and the -worde or -worth form of the same suffix can be recognized in garth, all of them words denoting hedged enclosures that each belonged to Ceofel. The site of the \\"Old Hall\\" was noted to the northwest of the church, enclosed on three sides by a moat 18 feet wide and three feet deep with further earthworks. The moat has recently been dug out to create a water filled area for wildlife. The village is located on the edge of a large natural aquifer which accounts for the large number of springs in and around the area. Recent cessation of water extraction by Severn Trent water (for use in the nearby Market Harborough conurbation) has led to a rise in the local water table. Facilities The White Lion There are no shops in North Kilworth, however a petrol station serves basic amenities. There is also a post office. An all weather tennis court area is situated opposite the school as well as a large football pitch area. North Kilworth F.C. play in the Leicestershire Senior League.

Treatment varies depending on severity, but often consists of embolism or splenectomy. Signs and symptoms The primary symptom, hemorrhage, presents differently depending on the degree of injury, with the symptoms of major hemorrhage, shock, abdominal pain, and distention being clinically obvious. Minor hemorrhage often presents as upper left quadrant pain. Patients with unexplained left upper quadrant pain, particularly if there is evidence of hypovolemia or shock, are generally inquired regarding any recent trauma. The primary concern in any splenic trauma is internal hemorrhage, though the exact amount of hemorrhage may be small or large, depending on the nature and degree of injury. Small or minor injuries often heal spontaneously, especially in children. Larger injuries hemorrhage extensively, often causing hemorrhagic shock. A splenic hematoma sometimes ruptures, usually in the first few days, although rupture can occur from hours to even months after injury. Cause Blunt splenic trauma most often occurs in automobile accident victims, in which it is a leading cause of internal bleeding. However, any type of major impact directed to the spleen may cause splenic trauma. This can happen in bicycling accidents, when the handlebar is forced into the left subcostal margin, and into the spleen. The degree of injury ranges from subcapsular hematoma, to splenic rupture. Diagnosis Diagnosis is confirmed with CT, or bedside ultrasound for less stable patients. Exploratory laparotomy is rarely used, though it may be of benefit in patients with particularly severe hemorrhage. A set of CT scan grading criteria was created to identify the need for intervention (surgery or embolization) in patients with splenic injury. The criteria were established using 20 CT scans from a database of hemodynamically stable patients with blunt splenic injury. These criteria were then validated in 56 consecutive patients retrospectively and appear to reliably predict the need for invasive management in patients with blunt injury to the spleen (sensitivity of 100%, specificity 88%, overall accuracy was 93%). The study suggested that the following three CT findings correlate with the need for intervention: #Devascularization or laceration involving 50% or more of the splenic parenchyma #Contrast blush greater than one centimeter in diameter (from active extravasation of IV contrast or pseudoaneurysm formation) #A large hemoperitoneum. Treatment Treatment has traditionally been splenectomy. However, splenectomy is avoided if possible, particularly in children, to avoid the resulting permanent susceptibility to bacterial infections. Most small, and some moderate-sized lacerations in stable patients (particularly children) are managed with hospital observation and sometimes transfusion rather than surgery. Embolization, blocking off of the hemorrhaging vessels, is a newer and less invasive treatment. When surgery is needed, the spleen can be surgically repaired in a few cases, but splenectomy is still the primary surgical treatment, and has the highest success rate of all treatments.

It was first published in 1921 according to LibrivoxPoetry, October 1921 and is therefore in the public domain. One reading is that the poem expresses Stevens's distrust of the reason of doleful philosophersThe 1913 Webster defines \\"funest\\" as \\"lamentable, doleful\\" and refers to Coleridge: \\"Funest and direful deaths.\\" and \\"gloomy grammarians\\", which creates a layer of obfuscation or \\"clouds\\" that occludes the illumination of imagination, \\"the sun and moon\\". The clouds may be those of Aristophanes' play, The Clouds, which ridiculed Socrates and the intellectual fashions of the time. The speech of clouds would contrast with \\"the simplest of speech\\" that would be enough for those who know \\"the ultimate plato\\", as Stevens writes in Homunculus et la Belle √âtoile. The poem is consistent with what Stevens called his \\"pagan\\" skepticism about religion in Sunday Morning (poem), and his distrust of rationalist philosophy (\\"rationalists, wearing square hats\\").

Plot The story follows Captain John Yossarian, a U.S. Army Air Forces B-25 bombardier, and a number of other characters. Most events occur while the airmen of the Fighting 256th (or \\"two to the fighting eighth power\\") Squadron are based on the island of Pianosa, west of Italy. Many events in the story are repeatedly described from differing points of view, so the reader learns more about the event from each iteration. Furthermore, the events are referred to as if the reader already knows all about them. The pacing of Catch-22 is frenetic, its tenor intellectual, and its humor largely absurd, though interspersed with moments of grisly realism. Production history Heller adapted his book for the stage in 1971, condensing its 500 pages and 50 named characters into two hours of stage time for a cast of nine. The existence of the author's adaptation means it is almost impossible for others to get adapting rights, and, in order to stage Catch-22, Heller's version has to be used. Until recently, the adaptation had had only limited success and had never been performed on Broadway as originally intended. However, Aquila Theatre produced a stage adaptation of Catch-22 directed by Peter Meineck and based on Heller's own 1971 version. This production toured the United States in 2007-8, and a production began in New York City in November at the Lucille Lortel Theatre, opening on November 23, 2008. A section based on events in Chapter 8 of the book Catch-22 was removed from the play to shorten its running time, and published as separate short one-act play, Clevinger's Trial, which has been produced occasionally.

Fardon is best known for his cover of the song \\"Indian Reservation\\" (1968), a UK number 3 hit and global million selling disc. He also wrote the football anthem \\"Belfast Boy\\" about George Best. Career Prior to becoming a singer, Fardon worked as a draughtsman for Alfred Herberts Ltd in Coventry. Before his solo success, Fardon was a singer with The Sorrows. His biggest success was his cover version of \\"Indian Reservation\\" by John D. Loudermilk (1968, Billboard Hot 100: number 20; 1970, UK: number 3; Australia: number 4). The global sales were estimated at over one million copies. His follow-up single \\"Belfast Boy\\", composed in honour of the Manchester United and Northern Ireland player George Best, reached number 32 in the UK single chart. \\"Follow Your Drum\\" reached number 16 on the Australian Singles Chart in May 1972. In 1973, his track \\"Delta Queen\\" reached number 86 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. He covered The Kinks' hit, \\"Lola\\" in 1974. Fardon also released a cover version of \\"Running Bear\\". In 2006 he re- released his single, \\"Belfast Boy\\", in tribute following the death of George Best. His recording of the song \\"I'm Alive\\" (a cover of Tommy James & The Shondells) has been featured in a UK television advertisement for Five Alive fruit drinks, and a Dutch Vodafone commercial.

Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. . This group includes neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis and recurrent palmoplantar hidradenitis. It can also be defined more generally as an inflammation of sweat glands. Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic cutaneous condition originally thought to be primarily characterized by suppurative inflammation of the apocrine sweat glands.Freedberg, et al. (2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. . Recent evidence supports that the primary event is follicular hyperkeratosis and obstruction, but the term hidradenitis supperativa has continued to be used in major medical journals. Symptoms  Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic inflammatory skin condition, considered a member of the acne family of disorders. It is sometimes called acne inversa. The first signs of HS are small bumps on the skin that resemble pimples, cysts, boils, or folliculitis. As the disease progresses and abscesses reoccur, they become larger and more painful; eventually tunnels of scar tissue connect the lesions. These lesions may open up if they become too enlarged and drain bloodstained pus. Risk factor One risk factor is age; HS usually first appears during the 20s and early 30s. The condition is much more common in women than in men but is usually more serious and debilitating in men. Other associated conditions include obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, arthritis, acne, and other inflammatory disorders. Early diagnosis of this disease is very important to decrease the number of flares, pain, and discomfort.>Revuz, J. E., Canoui- Poitrine, F., Wolkenstein, P., Viallette, C., Gabison, G., Pouget, F., ... & Grob, J. J. (2008). Prevalence and factors associated with hidradenitis suppurativa: results from two case-control studies. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, 59(4), 596-601. Treatment  The Mayo Clinic suggests the following: antibiotics (generally the lowest side effect profile compared to other treatments); corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone); but corticosteroids have many side effects, including \\"moon face\\" for the duration of the medication's trial usage, as well as unwanted hair growth for females and/or osteoporosis with long-term use. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors like infliximab (Remicade) and adalimumab (Humira) have shown promise for some, but they should probably be considered a third-line treatment, as treatment is associated with increased risk of infection, heart failure and certain cancers. Surgery is also available for those overwhelmed by the condition, but it will not cure the condition, just relieve the skin- related issues for a while. The disease is pernicious and is almost always guaranteed to return, if not in the same spot where the surgery was performed.Mayo Clinic: Hidradenitis suppurativa support Some products for adult acne may help relieve some symptoms for hidradenitis sufferers, although there is no guarantee it will work in all or even most individuals. Birth control Medication may relieve some symptoms for women; there is a hormonal treatment for men as well but that has not proven to be safe or effective as of yet.Birth Control Pills for Certain Female Skin-Related Issues Alternative treatments include alpha hydroxy acids (naturally available in small amounts in citrus fruits), Azelaic acid, and zinc. It is not thought that they are as effective as standard medical treatment but they tend to have less side effects. Some suggest tea tree oil and a specific strain of brewer's yeast, called CBS 5926. However, tea tree oil can cause contact dermatitis for some as well as breast development in teenage boys and should not be used if one suffers from rosacea due to the potentiality of worsening the symptoms of that skin condition. CBS 5962 can also cause migraines and intestinal issues for some. None of these have been formally tested by the FDA so beware the risk you take when you forgo traditional Western medicine for herbal supplements.Are there any effective natural skin treatment options?

Honor Bridget Fell, DBE, FRS (22 May 1900 ‚Äì 22 April 1986) was a British scientist and zoologist. Her contributions to science included the development of experimental methods in organ culture, tissue culture, and cell biology. Early life and education Fell was born to Colonel William Edwin Fell and Alice Fell at Fowthorpe near Filey in Yorkshire on 22 May 1900, the youngest of nine children. She had six sisters and two brothers, the younger of the two brothers, with down syndrome, died at the age of eight. Fell was known as the baby of the family. Her father was a minor landowner but cannot be said to have been a successful farmer. Whereas, her mother was a very practical and capable carpenter. Her mother died in 1951, when Fell was 51 years old. Both school and family records highlight her childhood love of pet ferrets. Fell carried her pet ferret, Janie, to her sister Barbara's wedding when she was only thirteen. Fell had little contact with her family until the 1960s when one of her nephews, Henry Fell, and his wife asked her to stay with them. After that one visit she always spent Easter with them and sometimes Christmas. She was educated at Wychwood School, North Oxford, and later at Madras College. In those days, Wychwood was considered rather advanced because of its emphasises on the importance of science, especially biology, as well as classics, history and literature. The school records refer to Honor Fell‚Äôs ferrets, which populated the garden. In 1916, she went to Madras College, St. Andrews. Later, in 1918, she began her undergraduate study in zoology at the University of Edinburgh, advised by Francis Albert Eley Crew. Crew recommended Fell as a summer researcher to Cambridge pathologist Thomas Strangeways, who was working in the then-new field of tissue culture. When Fell graduated in 1922 and found no open scientific positions in Edinburgh, she began work full-time as a research assistant to Strangeways. She earned a Ph.D. in 1924 entitled Historical studies on the gonads of the fowl and a D.Sc in 1932. Strangeways Research Laboratory The Strangeways Research Laboratory, Cambridge, was an independent world-renowned research institution. Due to the lack of funds in 1908, it was forced to shut down, but reopened the following year. After Thomas Strangeways' unexpected death in 1926, the future of his research facility, then known as the Cambridge Research Hospital, was in doubt. After advocacy by Fell and collaborator F.G. Spear, the institution's trustees decided to keep the research group open, with funding from the Medical Research Council. Fell was named the new director in 1928 and the institution's name was changed to the Strangeways Research Laboratory in honor of its founder. A great reason to appoint Fell was she did not require salary. Fell was funded by the Beit Memorial Fellowship and supported by the Royal Society Research Fellowship. The researchers who worked at the laboratory were never funded by the funds from the research lab, whereas were obtained from different sources. Fell served as director until 1970 when she was succeeded by Michael Abercrombie. During that time, she also maintained an active research program in tissue and organ culture. Although the laboratory was never well-funded‚ÄîFell described the funding situation at one point as \\"something of a nightmare\\"‚Äîit developed an international reputation for tissue culture, cell biology, and radiobiology, and attracted large numbers of visiting scientists; in one tabulation, visitors from 32 different countries were recorded. During the 1930s Fell took particular interest in finding positions for scientists arriving as refugees from continental Europe. As a rare example of a woman in senior scientific management of the time, Fell is also noted for supporting scientific careers for women at Strangeways, including Australian zoologist Margaret Hardy. Fell's skill in networking and administration is widely considered a major contributor to the success of the laboratory. Retirement In retirement, Fell became a research worker in the Division of Immunology, Department of Pathology, at the University of Cambridge, in 1970 where she once again took up the immunobiology of rheumatoid disease. She returned to Strangeways in 1979 and remained there, still working in the laboratory, until shortly before her death in 1986. Tissue and organ culture methods Fell's work area at Strangeways, ca. 1950. Fell's career began during the early stages of the development of tissue culture as a method for working with living cells. Before Fell joined, this research was originally started by biologist Ross Harrison in 1907. In 1910 he started by performing small experiments. This enabled scientists to study living differentiated cells in environments that resembled the behaviour of organs in the animal body. The transition from histological examination of fixed, stained tissues to observation of living cells attracted great enthusiasm when the techniques were first developed, although their utility was somewhat controversial among scientists during the early days. The most remarkable and fundamental method on cell culture is cell hybridization. An organ culture is an excellent experimental system to study the responses of organized, functional cells to environmental factors. Tissue culture also attracted significant popular media interest, with contemporary reports describing Fell as a woman working on \\"cultivating life in bottles\\" and tissue culture as leading to the growth of human babies in test tubes. Even though tissue culture has made such progress, it cannot tell us about the physiology of an animal‚Äôs circulatory or excretory systems or the physiology of its brain or sense organs. Which means the chemical compound that might appear quite harmless when tested on a tissue culture when administered, it might have disastrous side effects. Personal life Fell lived alone during her working life and never married or had children. She first lived at lodgings and then lived in a house near the Laboratory for easier access. She had her house looked after for some years her old nanny and then by a succession of devoted daily ladies. Even though she had some help she did her own domestic shopping before walking to Strangeways. She entertained little, but loved to go on picnics with her friends into the Fenland countryside. She listed ‚ÄòTravel‚Äô as her recreation in Who‚Äôs Who but her travel, though extensive and all around the world, was for the purpose of attending a conference to meet and work for a few weeks with fellow scientists or deliver an important lecture or receive a distinguished prize. She enjoyed travel for scientific events and conferences. Her skills at encouraging collaboration among scientists have been described as critical to the success of Strangeways during her directorship.

Motorola first introduced digital two-way radio in the U.S. in 1991 under the name ASTRO Digital Solutions.Motorola Solutions With the completion of the APCO Project 25 standard, Motorola introduced the ASTRO 25 solution and migrated its ASTRO Digital Solutions customers to ASTRO 25. Project 25 (also known as P25) is a suite of standards for digital radio communications that is designed specifically for law enforcement, fire and medical services to communicate with each other during emergency situations.Project 25 ASTRO 25 is now the most widely used P25 mission critical voice and data communication network in the world. It is designed to provide reliable and always available communication for public safety agencies. The Original ASTRO 25 format utilizes APCO Project 25 Phase I technology (FDMA). It is the most used format of the ASTRO 25 family of radio systems. The ASTRO 25 Phase II system, which complies with the P25 Phase II standard, uses TDMA technology to deliver both voice and data messaging over a single wireless communications infrastructure. Because ASTRO 25 Phase II is a P25 TDMA system, it offers greater spectrum efficiency, lower equipment costs, advanced radio features and flexibility, and longer battery life. The ASTRO 25 network also ensures encryption key assignment over the system's radio channels and enhanced network security tools. The ASTRO 25 digital radio system is claimed to provide superior audio quality and advanced features which comply with the Federal Communications Commission's narrowbanding requirements. ASTRO 25 currently operates in the 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, UHF and VHF bands for voice and data operation.  History  ASTRO technology originated in police cars in 1930 when Motorola began selling car radio receivers to police departments and municipalities. By 1991, ASTRO had grown to be the world's first narrowband digital radio system for public safety agencies. The New Hampshire USA State Police were the first to test and use a conventional ASTRO Digital Solutions system. They began extended year-long testing of ASTRO portable radios, mobile radios, base stations, dispatch consoles, and a wide-area system in December 1992 for State Police Troop A, and completed a phased installation several years later. This original ASTRO system was later converted to ASTRO 25. Today, next generation ASTRO 25 is the leading digital radio system in the world for public safety that delivers real-time interoperable communications to support day-to-day, mutual aid and task force operations. ASTRO 25 enables federal, state, and local public safety agencies to achieve compatibility and communicate in emergency situations and widespread disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, Superstorm Sandy, and the Boston Marathon bombing. As of 2014, ASTRO 25 is used in over 60 countries and more than three dozen U.S. states, from Alaska to Virginia, have deployed Motorola's statewide digital radio networks for their mission critical communications.  Mission Critical System  ASTRO 25 is a P25 standards-based mission critical network that provides integrated voice and data network communications for emergency response and coordinated communications during and after an incident. The ASTRO 25 network, two-way radios and advanced applications work together to improve first responder safety and decision-making capabilities. These innovative technologies optimize emergency response and enhance situational awareness. The ASTRO 25 network and radios have proved their ruggedness, reliability, interoperability and ease of use in emergency situations throughout the world ‚Äì such as the deadliest bushfires in Victoria, Australia's history in 2009; Superstorm Sandy, the most destructive hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season; and the devastating wildfires in southeastern Texas in 2013.  System Components  The ASTRO 25 core is the hub for the communications network. It consists of P25 portable and mobile radios, dispatch consoles, data applications and RF conventional or trunked sites. In addition to ASTRO 25, Motorola also builds a number of other P25 radio models, including the XTS/XTL‚Ñ¢ family of radios and the recently released series of APX‚Ñ¢ radios, designed for high durability and high reliability for first responders. With the ASTRO 25 core, organizations can deploy Motorola MCC 7500 and MCC 7100 IP Dispatch Consoles and have secure end-to-end encryption for all the radio traffic between operators and users in the field. In June 2013, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (METRO) announced it would implement an ASTRO 25 mission-critical Phase 2 700 MHz digital radio system to expand P25 TDMA interoperability throughout Clark County and Southern Nevada. In addition to the ASTRO 25 backbone, the communications system will also include Motorola APX‚Ñ¢ mobile and portable radios, upgraded dispatch equipment and helicopter radios.  ISSI: Connecting Multiple P25 Systems  In 2008 Motorola announced the first deployment of Inter RF Subsystem Interface (ISSI) gateways between live Project 25 public safety networks. The ISSI standard is a non-proprietary interface that allows two or more P25-compliant trunked systems to be connected‚Äîeven if they are from different vendors or operating in different frequency bands. It vastly extends the interoperability of radio systems without the need to fund super-large networks or install large, complex gateways. Motorola installed an ISSI prototype in Arizona, USA to demonstrate the ability to provide interoperability among existing communications systems. It was the culmination of months of multi-agency collaboration. According to former Arizona Governor, Janet Napolitano, \\"The Motorola ISSI gateway trial is an excellent example of driving innovation, which will enable our state with agency interoperability to best protect our residents and visitors.\\" In 2010, Motorola tested the ISSI equipment with five other emergency communications equipment manufacturers to demonstrate the effectiveness of P25 ISSI#ISSI Interoperability Testing for Voice Operations in Trunked Systems interoperability. The tests conducted on the ASTRO 25 system with the ISSI gateway confirmed that it was an easy and effective way to connect P25 systems and implement digital connectivity for emergency communications.  TDMA: Doubling Voice Capacity for Public Safety  In 2011, Motorola deployed ASTRO 25 systems with P25 Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) trunking to double the voice capacity of Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) technology for more efficient use of radio spectrum, providing users with improved system access for mission-critical communications. The P25 Phase 2 products were the first in the industry. By October 2013, over 30 customers had contracted for this market-leading P25 TDMA technology from Motorola. By January 2014, 74 customers had been shipped 106 zones licensed for TDMA. With the City of Apopka, Florida, Motorola Solutions implemented the world's first deployment and acceptance of a dual mode ASTRO 25 system with P25 TDMA trunking for Apopka police, fire and emergency management personnel and public works agencies. The system gives Apopka enhanced coverage and interoperability with surrounding agencies using 700 and 800 MHz frequencies, without the need for adding frequency bands, antenna sites or stations.  Maintaining Information Assurance  ASTRO 25 solutions are designed for information assurance, with state-of-the-art features that enable organizations to enhance their security posture by preventing, detecting and responding to external and internal risks. On January 19, 1996, Motorola was the first U.S. company to be granted FIPS 140-1 validation for its ASTRO subscriber encryption module, having been granted certificate number 2. ASTRO 25 was the first to support federal grade security with FIPS 140-1 and CJIS compliant integrated data and comply with the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) requirements for Criminal Justice Information System (CJIS); Department of Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation (DiaCAP); Defense Information Systems Agency (DiSa); Department of Defense Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DitSCAP); Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS); Federal Information Security Mandate Act (FiSMa); National Institute of Standards and Technology (NiSt) and NiSt-FIPS800 to identify security risks and vulnerabilities required by most Federal Agencies for themselves and their subcontractors. In 2011, Motorola expanded its wireless broadband portfolio to government and military markets with FIPS 140-2 Validation IPS 140-2. This enabled DOD and civilian government agencies to deploy secure wireless broadband networks by providing testing validation to help ensure the product successfully meets requirements for data encryption, role-based administrator access and physical security against tampering.

Charlotte County Public Schools. Retrieved on 2009-06-04. History The school is named after John Randolph and Patrick Henry, patriots of the Revolutionary era who had a debate in Charlotte Court House, one mile to the east. It was established in 1938 with the help of former ambassador David K. E. Bruce. The school has a World War II memorial plaque in honor of its students who fought for their country, a commitment to freedom few remaining high schools can boast. Athletics Randolph-Henry is classified as a Double A school by the Virginia High School League and is part of the A James River District and A Region B. Their mascot, the Statesmen was inspired by the patriotism of the country's early leaders, such as John Randolph and Patrick Henry, for whom the school is named. The school's baseball team has won two state championships in 2002 and 2005 and has won the Regional Championship eight times. Over fifty former baseball players from Randolph-Henry have gone on to play college in the past 40 years. Over that span of time, three coaches (Dick Bankston, Donnie Reebals and Billy Catron) combined to produce over 600 Varsity victories. The school's golf team, coached by Kelly Powell, is one of the best in the state, winning the state in 2005. They also placed third in the state in 2006, and second in the state in 2016. The varsity boys tennis team, coached by Kenny Howard, is also extremely talented, winning the A James River District for seven consecutive years, and being the A Region B runners- up during each of those years. In 2007, Zack Pack became the A State Boys' Tennis Singles Champion, following three years of being the Region B runner- up. Chris Boyd won the State Title for Randolph-Henry as a Junior in the 215 division of wrestling. Three Randolph-Henry athletes have signed with NCAA Division I football teams since 2000: John McCargo and Ryan Hathaway. John McCargo of Drakes Branch, VA signed with the North Carolina State Wolfpack in 2002. After being a redshirt as a freshman, McCargo played three years with the Wolfpack until entering the NFL draft in 2006 and signing with the Buffalo Bills as a defensive lineman. Ryan Hathaway of Keysville, VA signed with Norfolk State University in 2007. . Joe Reed played for University of Virginia from 2016 to 2019 and was listed as a first-team all-ACC player. He was drafted by the Los Angeles Chargers as a fidth round pick in 2020. Academic teams Randolph-Henry has several excellent and award-winning academic teams including theatre, forensics, ACE, and yearbook. The ACE, or Scholastic Bowl team has won the James River District Championship in the All-Around category for six consecutive years, and competed in the State Championship in 2001-2002, and also for the 2008-2009 school year. The Forensics Team claimed a 14 year James River District Tournament Championship title from 1999-2012. In addition, the forensics team was VHSL State Champion in 2004 and 2011 and was State Runner up in 2009, 2010, and 2012. The team has had seventeen individual state champions: William Deford (1965), Ann Roger (1965), Brian Gard (1989 & 1990), William Collins (1992), April Hamilton (2001), Josh Goff (2003), Lewis Tedesco (2004), Sam Catron (2006), Sameera Gadiyaram (2007), Katie Cross (2009), Savannah Ketchum (2010), Mary Margaret Watkins (2010 and 2011), Ryan Larson (2011), Dayton Dunnavant (2011), and Brittany Guill (2011), Josh Lacks (2012).

It was formerly classified as a pathovar of Pseudomonas syringae, but following ribotypical analysis, it was reinstated as a species. The type strain is CFBP 2341. Hosts & symptoms=Classification issue= Pseudomonas cannabina was once classified as Pseudomonas syringae pv. cannabina, but after extensive DNA testing of several P. syringae pathovars, P. cannabina was declared its own species, known as genomospecies 9. P. cannabina turns out to have at least two pathovars of its own: P. cannabina pv. cannabina and P. cannabina pv. alisalensis (formerly known as P. syringae pv. alisalensis). This distinction is supported by a difference in host range between the pathovars as well as physiological differences including carbon source utilization, bacteriophage sensitivity, and pigment production. P. cannabina pv. cannabina has only been shown to be pathogenic on Cannabis sativa, while P. cannabina pv. alisalensis has been shown to be pathogenic on broccoli, broccoli raab, radish, arugula, and oat, and probably infects other crucifers and grains though identification is difficult given the genomic confusion in the literature. For example, P. cannabina pv. alisalensis has also been shown through Multi-Locus Sequence Analysis to be responsible for bacterial blights in crucifers formerly associated with the B70 strain of Pseudomonas syringae maculicola identified on radish in Wisconsin in 1965. =Signs and symptoms= In crucifers, P. cannabis pv. alisalensis causes a blight on the leaves (appearing similarly to those caused by P. syringae as well as the common fungal disease Brown Leaf Spot)https://autoflower- portal.net/cannabis-diseases-bacteria/ The infection can be diagnosed by the following: * Yellowing of leaves * Small (2-5mm), angular, water-soaked lesions on foliage with chlorotic halos and tan or brown centers * Eventual necrosis of lesions * Blue-green fluorescence in cultivation Overwatering and stress increase plant susceptibility. In Cannabis, P. cannabina pv. cannabina causes stem and leaf rot of both industrial (hemp) and horticultural plants, producing similar symptoms to those observed in crucifers. Despite the fact that Pseudomonas bacterial blight is the most commonly documented disease of cannabis plants, the chlorotic lesions are often mistaken by horticultural growers for those of overwatering, nitrogen deficiency, phosphorus deficiency, or Septoria.http://www.ilovegrowingmarijuana.com/marijuana-diseases-leaf- septoria/http://www.growweedeasy.com/yellow-leaf-spot-leaf-septoria Environment=Geographical range= Bacterial blight caused by P. cannabina pv. alisalensis has been reported in Greece, Germany, Australia, Japan, and several regions of the US including the Midwest, South, and Pacific Coast. Though some of these identifications were mislabeled as P. syringae pv. alisalensis, the indication that P. cannabina pv. alisalensis has a wide, intercontinental distribution is clear. The distribution of P. cannabina pv. cannabina is less obvious, because the fluctuating legal status of the host plant creates difficulty in researching the disease, though it is frequently referred to as a common bacterial blight in the available cannabis horticulture literature. Bacterial blight in both hemp and crucifers is encouraged by cool, wet conditions in the range of , and is spread by water through irrigation of crops with a potential for seed transmission as well.http://bacdive.dsmz.de/index.php?search=13052&submit;=Search Relevance Humans have cultivated Cannabis sativa for thousands of years.https://www.deamuseum.org/ccp/cannabis/history.html Recently however, the legalization of cannabis for both recreational and medical use has come into the public eye in the US, as several states have moved to legalize the cultivation, research, and use of the plant. This burgeoning industry places a significant economic importance on diseases of the hemp plant in the global market, and education and control concerning possible crop impacts will be crucial as cannabis enters the mainstream economy. Globally, marijuana use, cultivation, and stigma differs from place to place, but the identification of geographic range and control measures for P. cannabina pv. cannabina will become more important as the legal status of hemp changes and widespread cultivation increases. While the virulence of P. cannabina pv. cannabina has not yet been studied extensively, a single square foot of marijuana plants can yield up to 6 ounces of sellable material which translates to a market value of roughly USD $1800/sq ft, depending on strain and local market prices, so even a small overall yield loss due to blight has the potential to be financially devastating. Hemp grown for industrial use has a significantly lower value/area ratio but in a large-scale production situation, loss from disease could still be devastating. Pseudomonas cannabina pv. alisalensis is already of great economic importance, as it affects many already-legal cruciferous horticultural crops worldwide and can severely damage or destroy the market value of an afflicted crop.

The job of a home shopping host is to introduce new presenters and guests to the television audience, and help these guests explain the values and features of the product being showcased. History Back in 1977, Clearwater, Florida radio station owner Lowell 'Bud' Paxson was collecting money from local companies that advertised on his station. One local company, a hardware store owner, refused payment, insisting that not one single customer had heard the broadcast of his radio advertisements. Paxson and the store owner argued back and forth, eventually coming to a compromise: Instead of a financial payment, the store owner gave Paxson a box filled with electric can openers. Paxson took the box, and returned to the radio station. When the station's talk radio host, Bob Circosta, was on a newsbreak, Paxson asked Circosta to sell these can openers to his audience. Circosta initially objected, but soon complied with his Paxson's wishes. \\"I looked at him like he had three heads,\\" Circosta said, recalling the moment. \\"I thought it would be unethical because I was trying to be a serious host.\\" When Circosta returned to the airwaves, he began describing the can openers and asking listeners to buy them. All 112 can openers were purchased in under an hour.What A Great Idea It Turned Out To Be Selling Can Openers On The Radio Tampa Tribune Sensing the sales potential of live, on-air product selling, Lowell 'Bud' Paxson and financier Roy Speer co- founded a local cable TV channel (channel 52 on Vision Cable) in 1982 that sold products directly to Florida viewers, and then launched nationwide in 1985. The channel was the Home Shopping Club, later Home Shopping Network, and Paxson's former radio man Bob Circosta was tapped as the network's first-ever host. HSN soon became a billion dollar enterprise and began the home shopping / electronic retailing industry. In 1996, the two sold HSN to Hollywood executive Barry Diller. In addition to Bob Circosta, other early home shopping hosts were Alice Cleveland, Bobbi Ray Carter, Tina Berry, Dan Dennis, John Cremeans, Maven Huffman and Lisa Robertson. Job requirements On all the major television shopping channels, the home shopping host will stay on the air for one to three hours at a time, welcoming several new guests and demonstrating many new products. Since products and guests are often only given 10 or 15 minutes to sell their product in the world of home shopping, it's not uncommon for a host to be required to introduce 20 or more different products and inventions during their shift. Being quick-witted, personable, and likeable is essential for a host, as well as being able to make quick transitions from one product to another. Additionally, with networks like HSN and QVC routinely debuting brand new inventions and products, the host must also quickly articulate to the audience why the item is worth purchasing. Job difficulties All the national American home shopping channels are broadcast live, 24 hours a day, so mistakes and errors cannot be edited out. This has led to some memorable on-air home shopping bloopers, such as a QVC demonstrator falling from a ladder and getting injured, or a Shop at Home host insisting that a moth in a photograph is actually a horse. Many of the guests who accompany the home shopping host on-air are not particularly TV-savvy or experienced, so the host must help guests better define the attributes and value of the items being showcased. Because of the large influx of guests and products, hosts often lack the time to study the product beforehand, which increases the need for an effective host to possess sufficient verbal skills to mask this lack of direct product knowledge.

Dr. Cox finally convinces Jordan to get rid of J.D. as the godfather of their baby and replace him with their son, Jack. They also choose Carla as the godmother. At the end of the episode, J.D. and Elliot try to comfort each other in the on-call room as they are each questioning their commitments. They talk about their past relationship (how they were perfect for each other, with matching faults and fears of commitment) and their anxiety about the future, especially since both of them seemed to have crossed \\"points of no return,\\" in their respective relationships. They realize that to escape their respective relationships, they would have to \\"do something huge\\" or \\"go nuclear.\\" The episode ends with a montage, first of Turk and Carla together, then Cox and Jordan together, then Keith alone, then Kim alone, with J.D. and Elliot leaning in for a kiss, although the episode (and season) ends without showing if anything actually happened, leaving the conclusion for the beginning of next season. Production details * Scrubs' creator and producer Bill Lawrence stated in an interview before the premiere of Season 7 that this episode was originally supposed to be the last, as at the time it aired, NBC still had not renewed the contract for another season. The purpose of the episode's ending was to leave it ambiguous to the viewers in case the show did not get renewed. * Elliot wears scrubs, which she has not done in 2 years. In the podcast commentary of \\"My Cold Shower,\\" Sarah Chalke refers to this in that it reminds her how much more comfortable the scrubs are than the heels that she usually wears. *The suit J.D. wears to the christening is the same suit he bought in My New Suit (although JD's brother Dan appeared to have taken it to a job interview). Continuity * This is the first time we see Jordan and Dr. Cox's daughter Jennifer Dylan. * When J.D. and Elliot talk about their lives, the viewer can see the words \\"PEACE SAM\\" stuck to the locker's door behind J.D. The same words can be seen in the locker room in \\"My Screw Up.\\" * J.D. is seen writing his godfather speech in his unicorn journal, a gift given to him in \\"My Unicorn\\" by Gregory Marks, a patient at Sacred Heart. * The Janitor's Brain Trust consists of different people than it did when it was last seen in \\"My Best Laid Plans\\". Cameos * During J.D's fantasy in which everyone leaves the lobby as Dr. Cox becomes enraged, Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence and one of the episode's writers Neil Goldman have cameos as two men running out of the gift shop with stuffed animals. * Mike Henry has a cameo in this episode as the new urologist. * The plans for Elliot's bachelorette party that Carla shows has a list of names of people invited, all of whom are production members of the show.

Aircraft of the Royal Naval Air Service were carried to within striking distance by seaplane tenders of the Royal Navy, supported by both surface ships and submarines. The aircraft flew over the Cuxhaven area and dropped their bombs, causing damage to shore installations. It was described at the time as an \\"air reconnaissance of the Heligoland Bight, including Cuxhaven, Heligoland and Wilhelmshaven ... by naval seaplanes\\" during which \\"the opportunity was taken of attacking with bombs points of military importance\\" in northern Imperial Germany. Planning The Zeppelin sheds at the Nordholz Airbase near Cuxhaven were out of range of UK-based aircraft, so a plan was developed for the seaplane tenders , (Squadron- commander Cecil Malone, who was also air commander for the raid) (Lieutenant E. D. M. Robertson) and (Lieutenant Frederick Bowhill), supported by the Harwich Force, a group of cruisers, destroyers and submarines commanded by Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt, to launch three seaplanes each from their station near Helgoland in the German Bight. The objective was to reconnoitre military installations in the area and if possible, bomb the Zeppelin sheds at Cuxhaven. Lieutenant Erskine Childers RNVR, the yachtsman and author of Riddle of the Sands, who had sailed the area before the war, provided the navigational briefing and accompanied Flight Commander Cecil Kilner as navigator and observer. Raid On Christmas Day, 1914, the first combined sea and air strike was executed by the Royal Navy, aimed at locating and if possible bombing the dirigible sheds housing German Zeppelins, to forestall attacks by the airships on Britain. The air temperature was just above 0 ¬∞C and of the nine seaplanes lowered to the water, only seven (three Short Improved Type 74 \\"Folders\\", two Short Type 81 Folders and two Short Type 135 Folders, all carrying three bombs) were able to start their engines and take off. Those unable to take part, a Short Type 81 (serial no. 122) and a Short \\"Improved Type 74\\" (serial no. 812), were winched back on board. Fog, low cloud and anti-aircraft fire prevented the raid from being a complete success, although several sites were attacked. Nevertheless, the raid demonstrated the feasibility of attack by ship-borne aircraft and showed the strategic importance of this new weapon. According to a telegram dated 7 January 1915, held in the \\"Churchill Archives Centre\\", at Churchill College, Cambridge, the \\"Admiralty Chief Censor intercepted message from Hartvig, Kjobenhaven to the Daily Mail, reporting that the British aerial raid on Cuxhaven [Germany] had forced the German Admiralty to remove the greater part of the High Seas Fleet from Cuxhaven to various places on the Kiel Canal.\\" The crews of all seven aircraft survived the raid, having been airborne for over three hours. Three aircraft, a Short 'Improved Type 74' (RNAS serial no. 811, flown by Flt. Lt. Charles Edmonds), a Short Admiralty Type 81 (RNAS serial no. 119, Flt. Cdr. R. P. Ross), and a Short Admiralty Type 135 (RNAS serial no. 136, Flt. Cdr. C. F. Kilner with Lt. Erskine Childers as his observer), regained their tenders and were recovered; three others (one \\"Admiralty Type 81\\", RNAS serial no. 120, Flt. Lt. A. J. Miley, and two Short 'Improved Type 74' folders, RNAS serial nos. 814 (Flt. Sub-Lt. V. Gaskell-Blackburn) and 815 (Flt. Cdr. D. A. Oliver)) landed off the East Friesian island of Norderney and their crews were taken on board the submarine , under the command of Lieutenant-Commander Martin Nasmith (the aircraft being scuttled to prevent them from falling into enemy hands); the seventh aircraft, a Short Admiralty Type 135 (RNAS serial no. 135) piloted by Flt. Lt. Francis E.T. Hewlett, suffered engine problems and was seen to ditch into the sea some off Helgoland. Hewlett was posted as missing, but he was found by the Dutch trawler Marta van Hattem, which took him on board and returned him to the port of IJmuiden in the Netherlands, where he disembarked on 2 January 1915 whence he made his way back to Britain. German reaction After the raid there was no response by the German High Seas Fleet. By contrast, the German naval arm was very active. Seaplanes and airships set out to discover the position of the attacking force. One reconnaissance seaplane, a FF.19 (No. 85) stayed aloft for five hours 52 minutes, a remarkable achievement for the period. Another seaplane from Heligoland spotted the British but due to not having a wireless transmitter had to return to the island to report. Sighting was also made by the airship L6 but due to a generator failure reporting was not initially made. The attacking force had been sailing in formation at a speed of but due to boiler difficulties, this speed could not be made by HMS Empress, which lagged astern of the formation. Consequently, the first combat was against this vessel. Two seaplanes attacked with bombs, and although one small bomb exploded only 20 feet off the bow, no damage was done to the ship or crew. The Zeppelin L6 followed by attacking with both bombs and machine gun fire. The crew of the Empress attempted to drive the Zeppelin away, initially with rifle fire as their 12-pounder in the stern was blanked by the superstructure. No damage was done to the ship, seaplanes or airship. Further attacks on the retiring force were attempted by submarines U-20, U-22 and U-30 but the manoeuvres of the British Fleet prevented any success. The British force returned to home waters without loss or damage. Conclusion The Cuxhaven raid was an imaginative endeavour, showing the willingness amongst naval and military leaders to adopt new technology and foreshadowed the air-sea battles of the future. It was a boost to British morale, and pointed the way to ways in which aircraft could be made more effective. Decorations ensuing from the action For their part in the Cuxhaven Raid, Kilner and Edmonds were awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO); Chief Petty Officer Mechanic James William Bell and Chief Petty Officer Mechanic Gilbert Howard William Budds were awarded the Distinguished Service Medal (DSM).

This is the main traditional music of Kerala state. It is a percussion dominated music. Basis Even in comparison to the classical carnatic music of South India, the hallmark of Kerala music lies in the dominance of percussion instruments, having its roots in the traditional kavu ritual music and the natural environment. Modern Kerala gives us hints of the sources from which these early musicians had created such a mighty and powerful music: the hammering sound of the woodpecker; the various sounds of falling rain on leaves or thatched roofs in the long rainy season; the croaking of the frogs after heavy rainfall; storm and wind moving the leaves of trees, bushes and grass. Or the man-made sounds: the regular noise of wood cutting and chopping; the washer women beating the dirty clothes onto the stones at the river or temple pond. The Malayalees only distinguish two forms of music kutuka (to drum) and pattu (to sing). The term pattu is also used for solo instrumental genres, with instruments like kuzhal (oboe) and kombu pattu (horn). Percussion domination means that the musical framework of the pieces is not determined by a melody or raga, but consists of a very sophisticated rhythmical structure and content. The ‚Äòmelody‚Äô of a piece is formed through a prominent rhythmic sound. Depending on the ritual this rhythm melody is more or less elaborated, and more or fewer compositional or improvisational elements are employed. A melody or raga, where it is used, is usually subordinated to the rhythm (an exception of this rule is kuzhal pattu). The term percussion-dominated indicates that the main instruments are drums and cymbals and the rhythmic structure is the main feature of the music. The wind instruments have in this sense a subordinated role to play. Actually, the function and entry of kuzhal and kombu in the big orchestras is very much the same as a rhythm instrument. The wind instruments have to embellish and to prolong the beat of the drums, to give signs for taking up the kalasom (a kind of cadential phrase) and have to play some pattern on the given talam. Common to all percussion items is that each single music genre represents a unique musical piece. Therefore, one of the bigger orchestral pieces, like the chenda melam (or melam), is always played with the same rhythmic structure. The beauty of every performance is the result of an intelligent and experienced combination of time and tempo. This combination is mainly responsible for whether the concert develops into a superior or merely an average performance. The main responsibility for this very difficult artistic task lies with the skill of the band leader, who is always a drum player and belongs to the Marar or Pooduval community. He is responsible for guiding the other musicians through the given time frame, to perform a chenda melam in one, two, three or even four hours. The position of the bandleader in melam is to be the most important solo musician, responsible for the pace and progress of the piece, rather than being a conductor guiding the orchestra from the front. The informal and relaxed atmosphere is enhanced by the band playing in front of the elephants, the audience pushing from all sides and punching the air with their fists. A point of confusion, especially in relationship to Karnatik music, are the terms and descriptions of the many talam (rhythm) cycles used in Kerala music. Though there are a certain distinctive number of talam cycles en vogue (i.e. with distinct numbers of beats and subdivisions) the terms vary by region, genre, and musician groups. We mention the talam cycles and subdivisions as we deal with each genre, using the name most commonly mentioned by the musicians of that genre. Kerala percussion genres kshetram vadyam and other Indian music systems There has been some confusion about how to categorize the many Indian music systems. The widely used great-little traditions dichotomy (great for \\"classical\\" and little for local or \\"folk\\" systems) or ‚Äì their Indian variation ‚Äì margi-desi sangit - seems unsuitable to be forced upon Kerala's musics. Many criteria for the 'great traditions', like professional status and training of the musicians, could be applied to the majority of the kavu and kshetram musical genres. Kerala musics ‚Äì like Indian musics in general ‚Äì consist of complex and interrelated traditions, established on a secular‚Äìsacred, and canonised‚Äìless canonised continuum, performed by professional, semi-professional and/or amateur musicians. In Kerala there has always been a strong emotional debate about whether the musical styles of Kerala constitute an independent category within Indian music or merely count as a subdivision of the Karnatik music system. While the Karnatik vocalist Venkitasubramonia Iyer, for instance, states that \\"the music of Kerala is fundamentally identical with the music of the rest of South India\\" (1969:5), the dramatist Kavalam Panikkar asserts \\"...each region of the south had its own musical culture which continues to retain its identity...\\" (1991:132). From an 'all-Indian perspective' we would suggest that there is no close relationship between Karnatik music and Kshetram vadyam and therefore both should be regarded as distinct music systems. The main differences are the ritualistic concepts, the relationship of music and musicians towards the ritual, the musician communities, genres, musical instruments, the tala (rhythmic) system, and the organisation and importance of rhythm within the overall concept. The similarities between both systems are not more significant than between Kshetram vadyam and any other music system in India. In the face of the ancient trade relations between Kerala and South-East Asia it might even be interesting to compare Kerala music with some of the genres prevalent on the Indonesian islands of Bali or Java. Finally, it needs to be said that the performers, being part of a living and still amazingly popular tradition, are not particularly concerned about these questions.From: Killius, Rolf. 2006 Ritual Music and Hindu Rituals of Kerala.

He initially served with the 44th Infantry Regiment and then was moved to the 3rd Moroccan Rifle Regiment, with which he first saw combat in 1912. Assigned to the 1st Mixed Rifle and Zouaves Regiment and then the 9th Zouaves March Regiment in the First World War, he finished the war at the head of a battalion and as a holder of the Legion of Honor. Promoted to Colonel in 1937, he was made a Brigadier in August 1941. This promotion was followed by promotion to Major General in March 1943. He was promoted again to Lieutenant General in August 1944, and then to General in September 1946. Monsabert commanded first the Corps Franc d'Afrique and then the reserve elements of the XIX Corps (France) during the campaign for Tunisia. Subsequently, he commanded the 3rd Algerian Infantry Division with the French Expeditionary Corps in the Italian Campaign. On 3 July 1944 his forces liberated Siena. To an artillery officer who was complaining about the sheer number of valuable monuments that were cluttering the maps, he issued the instruction \\"tirez o√π vous voulez, mais si vous tirez en-de√ß√† du XVIIIeme si√®cle, on vous fera fusiller!\\" (Fire where you wish, but if you fire on anything before the 18th century we'll get you shot!).

Monsabert led the II Corps with distinction for the remainder of the war in Europe. Monsabert, with about 130000 soldiers took Toulon and Marseille and played an active part in Alsace with a corps numbering nearly 150000 soldiers at that time. He then fought in Germany. In July 1945, he was made the commander of French forces in Germany. In 1946, he retired from active military service. From 1951 until 1955, Monsabert served as a deputy in the Rassemblement du Peuple Fran√ßais political party in the National Assembly of France, representing the region Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques.

Other than his attack on Havana, little is known of de Sores. He was nicknamed \\"The Exterminating Angel\\" (\\"L'Ange Exterminateur\\"). He was the leader of a band of Huguenot pirates and a lieutenant or former lieutenant of another French pirate, Fran√ßois le Clerc, who was called \\"Pegleg\\" or \\"Jambe de Bois\\" on account of his wooden leg. Le Clerc and Sores had set out from France in 1553 with three royal ships and a number of privateers under commission from Francis I of France who was envious of the riches returning to Spain from the New World. Le Clerc had raided Santiago de Cuba in 1554, and some accounts mention a raid on Santiago de Cuba by de Sores, although whether this was as part of the attack by le Clerc is not clear. He may have used Cayo Romano and Cayo Coco in the archipelago of Jardines del Rey adjacent to the northern Cuban coast as a base of operations. Details of the attack on Havana are also sketchy: the number of ships that de Sores used in the attack varies in different accounts from 2 to 20. Regardless of the number of ships involved, de Sores had little trouble in capturing the lightly defended town. Most accounts make it clear that he was expecting to find stores of gold in the town, while some claim he ransomed important members of the population. All agree that whatever his intention he was frustrated: he did not find vast reserves of gold in the city, and if he ransomed the population the ransom was mostly not paid. He destroyed the fortress of La Fuerza Vieja in today's Calle Tac√≥n and burnt most of the town. He also burnt the shipping in the harbour and laid waste to much of the surrounding countryside, and seems to have found time to organise a play \\"to insult the pope\\". The ease with which de Sores had captured the town prompted the Spanish crown to start a massive fortification programme. The Castillo de la Real Fuerza was built to replace the Vieja Fuerza and later the Castillo de los Tres Reyes Magos del Morro and the smaller Castillo de San Salvador de la Punta were built on opposite sides of the entrance to Havana harbour. On 15 July 1570 he murdered 40 Jesuit Portuguese missionaries and threw their bodies into the sea off Tazacorte in the Canary Islands off La Palma - crosses on the sea floor still mark the site at Malpique today.

It was first conceived by clinicians as a way for junior colleagues to round on patients. The patient was traditionally present for the round and would answer questions; grand rounds have evolved with most sessions rarely having a patient present and being more like lectures. An actor portrays the patient in some instances. Grand rounds help doctors and other healthcare professionals keep up to date in important evolving areas which may be outside of their core practice. Most departments at major teaching hospitals will have their own specialized, often weekly, grand rounds. Attending grand rounds is also an important supplement to medical school and on-the-job resident training. Grand rounds can also be distinguished from rounds which is the (typically) daily visit by the attending physician and team to all that physician's patients on the ward. Rounding with an attending physician is an important part of medical on-the-job training and education, but its primary focus is immediate care for the patients on the ward. Grand rounds tends to present the bigger picture, including experience with patients over many years, and the newest research and treatments in an area. Grand rounds tend to be open to the entire medical professional community, whereas rounds are specific to individual attending physicians and their teams. A 1966 report in the Australian journal Clinical Pediatrics called into question the sometimes inconsiderate behavior of practitioners who treated patients who were featured cases of grand rounds.  Video archives  Many teaching and research hospitals have started providing streaming video of their grand rounds presentations for free over the Internet. This is an opportunity for medical professionals and students to improve their knowledge, and builds on one of the core values of the Hippocratic Oath ‚Äì that medical education should be provided for free, and that doctors should actively and openly share their knowledge without compensation in order to improve patient care. Many of these organizations provide an archive of several years of recent grand rounds presentations and as such offer a tremendous resource for increasing medical knowledge and improving patient care.

Wards in dark grey were not contested in 2006. The 2006 Colchester Borough Council election took place on 4 May 2006 to elect members of Colchester Borough Council in Essex, England. One third of the council was up for election and the council stayed under no overall control. After the election, the composition of the council was *Conservative 30 *Liberal Democrats 21 *Labour 7 *Independent 2 Background Before the election the Conservatives had run the council since the 2004 election and had 28 of the 60 seats on the council. The Liberal Democrats had 22 seats, Labour had 7 seats and there were 3 independents. 20 seats were contested at the election, with the councillors who were defending seats including the Conservative leader of the council, John Jowers, the mayor Terry Sutton and the Liberal Democrat group leader, Colin Sykes. However the Conservatives did not have a candidate in New Town ward due to an error on their candidate's nomination papers. As well as the parties who were defending seats on the council, the Green Party contested every seat for the first time and particularly targeted Castle ward. Independents who stood included Gerard Oxford in Highwoods ward, who was defending a seat he had won as a Liberal Democrat before leaving the party. Issues A major issue at the election was the relocation of the bus station to a temporary site, while a new bus station was being built at a new shopping centre. Meanwhile, a Visual Arts Facility (VAF) was being built on the old bus station site. 6 independents stood at the election as part of a Save Our Bus Station Campaign opposing the move, with the Labour party also opposing the building of the VAF on the old bus station site. However the Conservatives said the temporary bus station site would be better than the old site. Both the Liberal Democrats and Greens called for more recycling, while the Liberal Democrat and Labour parties called for action on street cleaning. The Conservatives meanwhile defending their record in power, pointing to a number of new projects being started including a planned new community stadium. Election result The Conservatives made a net gain of 2 seats to have half of the seats on the council with 30 councillors, just falling short of winning a majority. Conservative gains included defeating the Liberal Democrat group leader Colin Sykes, with the Liberal Democrats falling to 21 seats. Labour remained on 7 seats after holding the only seat they had been defending, but polled less than the Greens in a number of wards. Overall turnout at the election was 36.4%.

The vessel was fully loaded with grain at the time of the incident. The United States Coast Guard investigated the incident and published its findings on December 8, 1997, citing the cause of the engine failure as a poorly-maintained oil filter. A secondary but contributory cause was determined to be a main-engine automation system that produced warnings and alarms that were not consistently relayed to the ship's Master. The National Transportation Safety Board published its final report on January 13, 1998, which concurred with the Coast Guard's determinations and appear to charge the ship's operating company with the responsibility for the casualty. The incident resulted in no deaths, but 66 people were injured. Physical damage to the Bright Field was calculated at $1,857,952. Damage to the Riverwalk, including the pier, condominium properties, shops and hotel, totaled an estimated $15 million. The spot where the Bright Field ran into the Riverwalk is marked on site with a plaque. The Bright Field was repaired immediately following the incident, and in 2000 was reportedly seen again in the New Orleans harbor bearing the name Bright Star. In 2007, the vessel was renamed Bright City, operating under the Liberian flag, and carried a Chinese crew. As of May 2010, it's been renamed Yong Xu Hai, under the Chinese flag.

Within the story are the separate plots that ultimately turn out to be connected to each other. One is the job of supplying security for the emir of Qatar, at a conference in Iceland. The second is to find a missing nuclear bomb. The Oregon's crew also has to pick up a radioactive iridium meteorite recently found in a mysterious ancient shrine, designed by Erik the Red and constructed by his crew. The Stone also holds primordial matter from another world, an oxygen eating microbe. There are also two different bands of fanatics.

The company is part of the Tilney Group and offers financial planning, investment management and investment advisory services to private clients. The company acquired competitors Towry in early 2017 and the combined business holds ¬£21 billion of client assets. History In April 1836, Thomas Tilney and his second son George set up a firm for the purpose of dealing in stocks and shares, with offices at 7, Water Street. Sharebroking was not Mr. Tilney's first business. He had followed his father into the shipping business on the Tyne but met with little success. Moving to Liverpool to try his fortunes there, both Thomas and his son George joined the already-existing Liverpool Sharebrokers' Association. The Association expanded and Mr. Tilney's third son Robert joined the firm in the 1840s. After their father's death in 1847 the two brothers continued to run the business, steering it through crises in the 1840s and 1860s before a serious quarrel between them led to the voluntary liquidation of the original company, Thomas Tilney & Sons and the formation of R J Tilney & Co. Robert Tilney died before his son Robert Henry came of age in 1887. Instructions were left for the business to be carried on by executors. During the 1880s, there was a growing interest in local industry. The Tilney archives record the names Lever (forebear of today's international Unilever), and Brunner Mond (which today forms part of ICI). The growth in power and importance of Liverpool, its international trading links and its thriving business community were reflected in the further development of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce. The Liverpool Stock Exchange grew in importance and prestige to mirror the town's general prosperity. In October 1895, R J Tilney & Co took on Mr. John Brocklebank at a salary of ¬£70 a year. Later he became a market floor trader, writing letters (by hand) to clients. Later still, in 1903, he became a Member of the Liverpool Stock Exchange, a partner in 1910 and, on the retirement of John Hyslop, the co-head of the firm, together with Col. Robert Henry Tilney. The firm's concern with insurance stocks is demonstrated in the figures in the R J Tilney Marine insurance book which give details of premium incomes, losses and interest income. The profits recorded increase considerably between 1887 and 1900. Just before the First World War, the Liverpool Stock Exchange and its member firms were flourishing, reflecting the city's general prosperity. R J Tilney & Co shared in this and was highly regarded by other businesses. =The First World War= Both father and eldest son were involved in active war service, John Brocklebank, the remaining partner held the fort. In dealing, the general price trend was downwards except for American securities but, towards the end of hostilities there was some improvement. Later, John Brocklebank was to write, \\"The financial history of the war period worked out n-draculously- all outstanding contracts completed, enormous loans paid off...\\" The end of the war found the company \\"with a clean and clear position.‚Äù All fit male staff had joined the forces but the government, persuaded by a letter from Col. Tilney himself at the battlefront, to exempt a Mr. Crosbie to keep the company going. However, disaster followed with the death in March 1918 of Major Leonard Arthur Tilney. It was to be 14 more years before another Tilney, Leonard's younger brother John joined the partnership. =The inter-war period= John Brocklebank, with William Crosbie, his new partner continued to run the company. The 20s began brightly with the cotton boom. The company's books record the names of English Sewing Cotton Company, Courtaulds, Fine Cotton Spinners etc. In 1926, John Threlfall was made a partner as a reward for 30 years' loyalty to the firm. Later, Arthur Hyslop joined the partnership. The difficulties of the post war years were emerging, which culminated in the Wall Street Crash and years of depression. John Brocklebank began to encourage John Tilney to begin with the firm in 1928 before he had finished his degree course. John, later Sir John, co-operated. Looking back he remembers the old office in Castle Street with its tall desks against which the clerks stood to write up the ledgers and the heartache and distress caused by the cotton crash of the 1930s. Cash calls were made on holders of partly paid cotton mill shares, which even then were deemed worthless. John Brown joined R J Tilney and became a partner because Grace Brothers, for whom he had worked, closed in Liverpool in anticipation of the Second World War. Meanwhile, the company celebrated its centenary in 1936. =Impact of the Second World War= The experience gained during the 1914-18 war proved helpful when war was declared in September 1939. The Liverpool Stock Exchange closed for two days only but then all transactions were restricted to cash settlement. At the outbreak of war R J Tilney had 17 male members of staff. Eleven joined the armed forces with three deaths in active service. Of the six remaining, three were over military age and the rest either disabled or too young. After the war ended, the Stock Exchange re-introduced account dealing in 1946 and continuation business in 1949. The company staff and partners held a Victory Reunion dinner in May 1947. =1950‚Äì86= John Tilney was elected to parliament in 1950 as MP for Wavertree, remaining an MP until his retirement in February 1974. Much of the day-to-day work in the fifties, therefore, was covered by John Patrick Bingham, one of Tilney's five partners. Business was growing and there were changes proposed in the operation of the Liverpool Stock Exchange. Therefore, it was thought the size of R J Tilney should be increased to strengthen their impact. The easiest way was through merger, the first of these being with Messrs Parr & Rae in 1958 to form Tilney, Parr & Rae. The new partnership numbered ten and Sefton House became its home until, as part of the Charterhouse Group, it moved in August 1988 to grand new offices in the Royal Liver Building. The Royal Liver Building Partner Keith Rae looked for further opportunities to expand and contacts were built up with T K Holden & Son. To try and cope with the pressure being placed on regional exchanges by London, the Northern Stock Exchange was formed in 1965. It comprised the separate exchanges of Liverpool, Manchester, Huddersfield, Leeds, Newcastle, Sheffield and Oldham. This led to new regulations about the size of member firms, minimum partner requirements and the creation of a jobbing broking system along the lines of London's. Tilney, Parr & Rae consequently acquired G H Chamberlain and Sing White. The combined Group, with 12 partners, was to be known as Tilney, Sing, Parr & Rae. The mid sixties brought a change in the industry. For the next ten years, there was a growth of research and a development in institutional and corporate business. The Tilney Partnership took on Alan Binks and John Hancox, both qualified accountants. They became partners with special responsibility for this area of the business. At the same time, the level of direct investment by individuals was declining because of the taxation policies of successive governments after the war and especially following the introduction of Capital Gains Tax after 1965. The fragile economic boom of the early 1970s was followed by rapidly rising inflation, penal taxation of inflation-driven corporate profits, higher interest rates with a resultant squeeze on over-borrowed property companies and the subsequent secondary banking crisis. However, a period of crisis followed in 1974-5. It was partly caused by industrial unrest under the Heath government and the 3-day working week and partly by the rise in oil prices after the Arab-Israeli War. These factors led to a sharp fall in Stock Market values. The company responded with a sharp and painful cut in its personnel and activities. Staff numbers went from 158 in 1972 to just 64 by 1974. When the market improved in the mid to late seventies, the new technology and computerisation meant that a large staff was no longer necessary. Tilney prospered, extending its business into the new areas of building, brewing and electronics, whilst the long established dealing in shipping was extended. As the firm dealt increasingly with large institutions who wanted informed research at a local level it was decided to expand this aspect of the business. For this purpose Tilney joined with Charles W Jones & Co. Since regional stock exchanges, including the Northern had disbanded, the merger with Jones made Tilney a large enough concern to deal directly with the London Stock exchange. The introduction of the telephone STX system made it possible to extend the range of institutional contacts. The corporate finance side of the business expanded quickly with Tilney acting as broker to a number of listed companies, many of them locally based. The computer facilities had initially coped with internal client accounting records and the private client department was equipped with desktop terminals, linked to the main computer. This enabled the partners to give a better service to their clients. The system provided a complete record of each portfolio with details of its current value, past transactions, deals in the current account and so on, all of which could be easily accessed while speaking to a client on the telephone. In May 1986, Tilney was taken over by the Charterhouse Group, resulting in Charterhouse Tilney, the ultimate parent being The Royal Bank of Scotland. After 150 years of independence the catalyst which joined Tilney to Charterhouse were the changes arising from the Restrictive Practices Case and the resulting change in the structure of the London market known as the \\"Big Bang\\". Tilney's base outside London had its attractions; overheads would be lower and no great upheavals would be necessary. =1986‚Äì2014= In 1988, the Liverpool Head Office moved from Sefton House to the prestigious Royal Liver Building on the Liverpool waterfront ‚Äì one of the world's most famous landmarks. In 1990, Charterhouse Tilney took over Campbell Neill, a Scottish- based stockbroker which resulted in a Glasgow office being established. By 1993, the wheel had turned full circle and a management buy-out of the private client division was effected with the name reverting to Tilney & Co. Tilney & Co steadily expanded to become one of the largest fund managers and stockbrokers in the U.K. In April 1998, the official name for the main operating company changed to Tilney Investment Management to give a clear statement of the primary business activity to both existing and prospective clients. In June 1998, formal links were established with Fortsmann-Leff, a New York City and Chicago based boutique fund management house. Tilney back office administration was outsourced to the Bank of New York in 2002 ‚Äì significantly reducing costs for the firm. Tilney acquired the private client divisions of Edinburgh Fund Managers and SG Hambros in 2003, The Pensions Partnership, a pension consultant (2003) and Cardales, a specialist commercial property fund manager and service provider in 2004. Senior executives at Tilney led an MBO of the firm in April 2005 with the support of the private equity firm Bridgepoint Capital. Bridgepoint is one of the leading European mid-market private equity buyout groups. Tilney acquired the discretionary fund management business of Clydesdale Bank in 2006. In December 2006, as part of a strategic move to strengthen its presence in the UK private wealth management market, Deutsche Bank acquired Tilney Group from Bridgepoint and Tilney management. The acquisition was a key element in Deutsche Bank's private wealth management strategy to expand its onshore presence in its dedicated core markets and expand into various client segments, including the Independent Financial Advisers sector. Tilney Investment Management has six branch offices, the oldest being Shrewsbury which was opened in 1966. The London office was opened in 1974, Edinburgh after the take-over by Charterhouse in January 1987 and Glasgow as previously mentioned in 1990. Birmingham was created in 1992. Tilney currently holds a total of ¬£6.7 bn of clients' assets in custody. Tilney Private Wealth Management is the investment management arm of the Tilney Group, which is committed to providing a comprehensive range of services to over 15,000 private clients and employs over 300 staff throughout the UK. It is regulated by The Financial Services Authority and is a member of the London Stock Exchange. All client executives are members of The Securities Institute and participate in a continuous programme of professional development. Tilney Fund Management ‚Äì The specialist fund management division of Tilney Investment Management provides dedicated fund management and has been managing institutional funds for over 35 years and has over 100 Pension Fund clients alone with total funds of over E239m. In addition, the division manages funds on behalf of Health Authorities, hospital trusts and educational establishments, including several universities. It also offers a Liquidity Management service to institutions with large cash sums to manage. The Tilney Group also offers a variety of collective products to the individual and institutions through Tilney Collective Management Limited. These were originally launched as Unit Trusts during 1995/1996. Present day In February 2014, Permira agreed to buy Tilney from Deutsche Bank with the ambition of creating a wealth manager with 9 billion of assets. After completion of the deal in May 2014 Bestinvest and Tilney combined to create Tilney Bestinvest.Tilney to merge with Bestinvest ReferencesExternal links * Company Web Site Category:Financial services companies established in 1836 Category:Investment management companies of the United Kingdom Category:Private equity portfolio companies Category:Companies based in London Category:1836 establishments in England ","title":"Tilney Ltd."},{"id":"10371828","text":"Logo Theos (from the , theos, \\"God\\") is a religion and society think tank based in the United Kingdom which exists to undertake research and provide commentary on social and political arrangements.

After Abu al-Walid's death in April 2004, he assumed command of the Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya. He was killed in Dagestan on November 26, 2006. Biography=Early life= Most of whatever little is known about al-Urduni, is known through the Russian media. It is however fairly certain that his given name is Farid Yusef Umeira, that he was born in Jordan and that he participated in the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War and the Tajik civil war along with Khattab and al-Walid. With the latter two he came to Chechnya in 1995 where he would remain until his death. He would also marry two Chechen women.The Jamestown Foundation; ABU HAFS AND THE FUTURE OF ARAB FIGHTERS IN CHECHNYA =Chechen Wars= In the First and Second Chechen War he fought in the battalion of Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya under Khattab and, after Khattab's death, as al-Walid's deputy. After al-Walid's death in 2004, al- Urduni succeeded him as Amir of the battalion and issued a video statement about al-Walid's death, much the same way as al-Walid had done with his own predecessor, Khattab. As commander of the Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya, al- Urduni faced increasingly harsh conditions for himself and his unit of foreign fighters. Apart from the loss of their most prominent commanders and the relentless hunt for separatists by the Russian Federal Forces, funding for the battalion had also become a major problem due to anti-terrorism measures restricting financial transactions. Abu Hafs orchestrated and launched the 2004 Avtury raid and the 2006 Avtury ambush on Russian forces in Avtury, Chechnya. Videos of the ambushes were made and now circulate the internet. =Alleged links to al-Qaeda= Colin Powell's 2003 UN presentation slide showing Abu Hafs and others as part of the al-Zarqawi's global terrorist network. (Subsequently, shown to be an incorrect allegation.) The name of Abu Hafs al-Urduni is often mentioned in connection with Al-Qaeda. Russian intelligence sources and media have repeatedly accused him of being al-Qaeda's emissary in the Caucasus. His name is also found in a presentation of Colin Powell, then U.S. Secretary of State at the Security Council in February 2003 just before the Iraq War, where al-Urduni was stated to be part of a supposed international network headed by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. In an interview with Kavkaz Center, al-Urduni once expressed his sympathy with al-Qaeda and Osama bin-Laden, although he did not admit to being part of the organization. On a different occasion he condemned the Beslan hostage crisis and denied personal involvement. Whether or not he was an agent of al-Qaeda or if there are, or have been, any formal ties between the Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya and al- Qaeda remains unclear. =Death= November 26, 2006, Abu Hafs al-Urduni was killed in a gunfight with Russian special forces in Khasav-Yurt, Dagestan. Russian sources claim the fire fight lasted for four hours, and that four other rebels were killed in the encounter. The Kavkaz Center later confirmed al-Urduni's death, but claims only two other rebels were killed in the fighting. December 9, 2006, Qoqaz News, the Chechen Mujahideen online news agency, reported that Muhannad had succeeded al-Urduni as commander of the Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya.Site Institute; The Commander Muhannad Assumes the Leadership of the Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya Following the Death of Abu Hafs al-Urduni See also * Abu Omar al-Saif * Abu Zaid Al-Kuwaiti * Dagestan War * Mujahideen in Chechnya ReferencesExternal links * The Jamestown Foundation; ABU HAFS AL-URDANI: THE QUIET MUJAHID * The Jamestown Foundation‚Äôs Chechnya Weekly; The Rise and Fall of Foreign Fighters in Chechnya * Prague Watchdog; The radicalisation of the Chechen separatist movement: Myth or reality? * GlobalTerrorAlert; Communiqu√© from Abu Hafs al-Urdani (Jordan), Commander of the Foreign Mujahideen in Chechnya(PDF) * Site Institute; Qoqaz News Confirms Death of Chechen Mujahideen Commander Abu Hafs al-Urduni Category:1973 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Foreign volunteers in Chechnya Category:Islamic terrorism in Russia Category:Military personnel killed in action Category:Jordanian Sunni Muslims Category:Warlords ","title":"Abu Hafs al-Urduni"},{"id":"10371894","text":"\\"Into Oblivion (Reunion)\\" is the opening track, and first single, from Funeral for a Friend's album, Tales Don't Tell Themselves.

Life  Helms was born in Teterow into a Jewish family, who were able to escape the Holocaust by using falsified papers. He spent his childhood and youth in Teterow and Berlin. He received his first musical education whilst young, learning the piano and theory from an immigrant from Byelorussia. During the Nazi era he became acquainted with Swing and jazz from secretly listening to \\"enemy transmitters\\". In the years immediately after the Second World War, Helms studied tenor saxophone with a member of the US army and appeared from 1950 until 1952 in Sweden as a jazz musician. He played with, amongst others, Charlie Parker and Gene Krupa, and also in 1953 in Vienna with Hans Koller. As well as being preoccupied with new music (Charles Ives, Henry Cowell, Alban Berg and the Second Viennese School) Helms, working at the Viennese radio station Rot-Wei√ü-Rot (RWR), created with, amongst others, Ingeborg Bachmann, the radio genre Jazz & Lyrik. In G√∂ttingen, where he lived from 1953 onwards, Helms first made the acquaintance of the philosopher and sociologist Helmuth Plessner, then later with Theodor W. Adorno. His social and cultural critiques were significantly influenced by the Frankfurt school and critical theory. He also studied comparative linguistics with Roman Jakobson and philosophy and social theory with Max Horkheimer and Siegfried Kracauer; however, Helms describes the Marxist economist J√ºrgen Kuczynski as his most important teacher. In 1955, the self-taught Helms began to compose. From 1957 onwards he made his base in Cologne, where he worked together with the composer Gottfried Michael Koenig at the buildings of the Studios f√ºr Elektronische Musik at Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR). He directed phonetic experiments together with the physicist and communications researcher Werner Meyer Eppler, who also advised Herbert Eimert and Karlheinz Stockhausen at the same time. This work consisted of speech and sound analyses as well as linguistic and cybernetic studies. Helms made contacts with Stockhausen, Pierre Boulez and John Cage through the Donaueschinger Musiktage and the Darmst√§dter Ferienkurse (where Helms visited and sometimes lectured from 1957‚Äì1970); he was especially drawn to Cage's music using radio broadcasts and writings. In Helms' abode a circle was formed, which included, as well as Koenig, also Mauricio Kagel and the musicicologist Heinz-Klaus Metzger; a central preoccupation was James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. From this influence, Helms developed two 'language-music compositions' (Sprach-Musik-Kompositionen), Fa:m Ahniesgwow and daidalos; later, in collaboration with Hans Otte, came GOLEM and KONSTRUKTIONEN. His Text for Bruno Maderna (1959), a work consisting entirely of phonemes, was used by Maderna in his stagework Hyperion (1964). Helms would apply principles to language which derived from musical techniques of serialism, organising phonemes and morphemes to create new linguistic constructions in such a manner. This work paralleled that of other contemporaries of the time, in particular Dieter Schnebel. During the 1960s, when Helms became a private pupil of Adorno, he studied the Critical theory (Frankfurt School) and its roots in Marxism. Thereby he discovered Max Stirner, whose work Der Einzige und sein Eigentum (The Ego and Its Own) had provoked a violent critique from Marx, which led in consequence to his basic concept of Historical Materialism. Helms worked for many years upon this work of Stirner and its reception, producing his literary opus magnum, the 600-page Die Ideologie der anonymen Gesellschaft in 1966. Helms saw himself, with his critique of Stirner, in the tradition from both Marx and some contemporary Marxists, who had already recognised 'the suppurative focus' and Stirner's 'current danger'.Hans G Helms: Die Ideologie der anonymen Gesellschaft. K√∂ln: DuMont Schauberg 1966, p. 495 In his work, Helms presented the view that Stirner created 'the first consistent formulation ... of the ideology of the middle class' and further that Hitler articulated a specifically middle-class ideology and that Stirner- ism and National Socialism are both variations upon the same fascist demons. 'Because this demon lives on in West Germany, controlled by the middle classes, he has written this book to fight it'.Hans G Helms: Die Ideologie der anonymen Gesellschaft. K√∂ln: DuMont Schauberg 1966, Vorwort pp. 1‚Äì5, 481 Afterwards he stopped composing in order to concentrate on producing music broadcasts and films (including works on Ives, Boulez and Stockhausen), believing radio and television as the more effective media for presenting social critique. He concluded his studies in sociology with a doctorate at the University of Bremen in 1974; as well as travelling to European and North African countries, he held a Guest Professorship between 1976 and 1978 at the University of Illinois. In 1978, he moved to the United States, and from 1982 lived in New York City. Here Helms investigated the effects of the computer and telecommunications development on the field of employment, engaging in critiques of capitalism and globalization, as well as the social consequences of modern town planning. He predominantly made use of field research and interviews. He published his findings in political and scientific, music and literary magazines, trade union journals, and daily papers; and compiled radio and television productions for several ARD broadcasting corporations. In 1988, Helms returned to Germany, first living in Cologne; in 2003 he moved to Berlin. He adds to his studies work on the history of the Jews in Eastern Europe, as well as, separately, looking critically at the conditions of work of contemporary composers who use electronics and computers.

Physicist Heinrich Konen, involved in founding and building the organization due to his relationship with Schmidt-Ott, became a long-standing member of its executive committee. Member institutions of the NG included all German universities, all polytechnics (Technische Hochschulen), the five German Academies of Science, and the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft. In 1929, the NG was renamed the Deutsche Gemeinschaft zur Erhaltung und F√∂rderung der Forschung (German Association for the Support and Advancement of Scientific Research); also known in short as the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG).Gesch√§ftsordnung der Deutschen Gemeinschaft zur Erhaltung und F√∂rderung der Forschung (Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft) vom 9. September 1929, rep. in Zierold, 1968, pp. 592-595. Until 1934, the NG acted under supervision of the Reichsinnenministerium (Reich Interior Ministry), and after that under the Reichserziehungsministerium (Reich Education Ministry).The official title of the REM was Reichsministerium f√ºr Wissenschaft, Erziehung und Volksbildung. In 1945, by the end of World War II in Germany, the NG was no longer active. In 1949, it was re-established in the newly founded Federal Republic of Germany as the NG and from 1951 as the DFG.Hentschel, 1996, Appendix A; see the entry for NG.Heilbron, 2000, pp. 90-92.Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Konen. The objective of the NG was to provide the regional, disciplinary, and political factions of the academic community with a central institution to facilitate raising and distributing funds for the totality of German sciences and humanities. Originally, it was to alleviate especially the increased financial needs after World War I due to monetary inflation and generally higher costs in research. As presiding secretary of the PAW, Planck briefly headed the NG until Schmidt-Ott was installed as president. The NG was successful in raising funds and support from the central German government as well as financial contributions from corporate sources in Germany and abroad.

He moved from working in a chemical factory in St Helens and built his own chemical factory in 1847 in the Woodend area of Widnes near to Widnes Dock by the junction of the Sankey Canal and the River Mersey. In this factory he manufactured alkali by the Leblanc process. He later opened a second alkali factory nearby and developed a number of other business interests. He died at the early age of 40 by which time a number of other chemical factories had opened in the town. Early life The Hutchinson family came from Durham but moved to Liverpool where John was born. His father, John, had held a commission in the Royal Navy and served under Nelson during the Napoleonic Wars. In Liverpool he was a shipbroker and he acted as a Lloyd's agent. Nothing is known of John junior's early education until he was a student in Paris where he met Andrew George Kurtz, the son of Andrew Kurtz who owned an alkali factory in St Helens. Hutchinson was subsequently given a post at this factory. Chemical business In 1848 Hutchinson, at the age of 22, obtained a lease of land in Widnes, where he established his first factory, Hutchinson's No 1 Works. This was built between the terminus of the Sankey Canal where it entered the River Mersey and the terminus of the St Helens and Runcorn Gap Railway where Widnes Dock, the first railway dock in the world, had been established. This area was later to form part of what was later known as Spike Island. By 1851 Hutchinson was employing 100 men. His first works manager was Henry Deacon but Deacon left to found his own alkali factory nearby in 1853. When Hutchinson arrived in Widnes there was plenty of available labour, partly because of the immigration of Irish unskilled men due to the Great Famine. In 1859 Hutchinson built his No 2 Works on land he acquired from William Gossage between Gossage's factory, on the other side of the Sankey Canal, and Waterloo Road, where he also built the Tower Building to house his office. In 1861 John Brunner came to work at Hutchinson's, joining his older brother Henry, and he was soon appointed as the office manager. In 1862 the German chemist Ludwig Mond also joined Hutchinson's and a friendship developed between the Brunners and Mond. The association between John Brunner and Ludwig Mond was later to develop into the chemical business of Brunner Mond and Company in Northwich. () Around 1853 Hutchinson entered into partnership with Oswald Earle who had interests in the lime business and they traded as \\"Hutchinson and Earle\\". It is likely that Earle was the selling agent for this business. In addition to his alkali factories, Hutchinson had interests in quarrying, building and farming. He eventually owned more than of land. He had his own private gasworks near his home in Appleton from which he supplied to gas to customers living nearby. He developed land to the west of his factories on Widnes Marsh and Moor where other industrialists built their factories and where another dock, West Bank Dock was built. This area was connected to the Warrington-Widnes-Garston railway by lines owned privately by Hutchinson. Hutchinson was also the owner of the first privately owned locomotive in the town. By the time of his death in 1865 Hutchinson was employing 600 men. Politics and religion Hutchinson was politically a Liberal but he played no part in local government. He had intended to stand as a candidate for Parliament but he died before this was achieved. He stated that in religion he was a Protestant but he rarely attended a place of worship. However he formed good relations with priests from both the Roman Catholic and the Anglican churches. Personal life In 1850 Hutchinson married Mary Elizabeth Kinsey who had been born in Ireland but who was a member of an old Cheshire and Shropshire family. They lived throughout their marriage in Appleton Lodge, Widnes, and had five children, three daughters and two sons, including John, Arthur, Mary and Gertrude. In 1865 at the age of 40 years Hutchinson died at his home. The cause of his death was certified as consumption and his estate was valued at under ¬£50,000. During his life the population of Widnes had increased almost fivefold. His contemporaries called him \\"the father of Widnes\\".

He was an executive producer of the project, along with George Stelzner of West Egg Studios. Spoto served as script consultant for The Girl (2012), an HBO/BBC TV movie based on Spoto's books about Alfred Hitchcock. Starring Toby Jones and Sienna Miller, the film offers an account of Hitchcock's treatment of Tippi Hedren during the filming of The Birds (1963).

GF is capable of parsing and generating texts in several languages simultaneously while working from a language-independent representation of meaning. Grammars written in GF can be compiled into different formats including JavaScript and Java and can be reused as software components. A companion to GF is the GF Resource Grammar Library, a reusable library for dealing with the morphology and syntax of a growing number of natural languages. Both GF itself and the GF Resource Grammar Library are open-source. Typologically, GF is a functional programming language. Mathematically, it is a type-theoretic formal system (a logical framework to be precise) based on Martin-L√∂f's intuitionistic type theory, with additional judgments tailored specifically to the domain of linguistics. Language features * a static type system, to detect potential programming errors * functional programming for powerful abstractions * support for writing libraries, to be used on other grammars * tools for Information extraction, to convert linguistic resources into GF Tutorial Goal: write a multilingual grammar for expressing statements about John and Mary loving each other.LREC 2010 tutorial =Abstract and concrete modules= In GF, grammars are divided to two module types: * an abstract module, containing judgement forms and . ** or category declarations list categories i.e. all the possible types of trees there can be. ** or function declarations state functions and their types, these must be implemented by concrete modules (see below). * one or more concrete modules, containing judgement forms and . ** or linearization type definitions, says what type of objects linearization produces for each category listed in . ** or linearization rules implement functions declared in . They say how trees are linearized. Consider the following: Abstract syntax abstract Zero = { cat S ; NP ; VP ; V2 ; fun Pred : NP -> VP -> S ; Compl : V2 -> NP -> VP ; John, Mary : NP ; Love : V2 ; } Concrete syntax: English concrete ZeroEng of Zero = { lincat S, NP, VP, V2 = Str ; lin Pred np vp = np ++ vp ; Compl v2 np = v2 ++ np ; John = \\"John\\" ; Mary = \\"Mary\\" ; Love = \\"loves\\" ; } Notice: (token list or \\"string\\") as the only linearization type. =Making a grammar multilingual= A single abstract syntax may be applied to many concrete syntaxes, in our case one for each new natural language we wish to add. The same system of trees can be given: * different words * different word orders * different linearization types Concrete syntax: French concrete ZeroFre of Zero = { lincat S, NP, VP, V2 = Str ; lin Pred np vp = np ++ vp ; Compl v2 np = v2 ++ np ; John = \\"Jean\\" ; Mary = \\"Marie\\" ; Love = \\"aime\\" ; } =Translation and multilingual generation= We can now use our grammar to translate phrases between French and English. The following commands can be executed in the GF interactive shell. Import many grammars with the same abstract syntax > import ZeroEng.gf ZeroFre.gf Languages: ZeroEng ZeroFre Translation: pipe linearization to parsing > parse -lang=Eng \\"John loves Mary\\"  linearize -lang=Fre Jean aime Marie Multilingual generation: linearize into all languages > generate_random  linearize -treebank Zero: Pred Mary (Compl Love Mary) ZeroEng: Mary loves Mary ZeroFre: Marie aime Marie =Parameters, tables= Latin has cases: nominative for subject, accusative for object. * Ioannes Mariam amat \\"John-Nom loves Mary-Acc\\" * Maria Ioannem amat \\"Mary-Nom loves John-Acc\\" We use a parameter type for case (just 2 of Latin's 6 cases). The linearization type of NP is a table type: from to . The linearization of is an inflection table. When using an NP, we select () the appropriate case from the table. Concrete syntax: Latin concrete ZeroLat of Zero = { lincat S, VP, V2 = Str ; NP = Case => Str ; lin Pred np vp = np ! Nom ++ vp ; Compl v2 np = np ! Acc ++ v2 ; John = table {Nom => \\"Ioannes\\" ; Acc => \\"Ioannem\\"} ; Mary = table {Nom => \\"Maria\\" ; Acc => \\"Mariam\\"} ; Love = \\"amat\\" ; param Case = Nom  Acc ; } =Discontinuous constituents, records= In Dutch, the verb heeft lief is a discontinuous constituent. The linearization type of is a record type with two fields. The linearization of is a record. The values of fields are picked by projection () Concrete syntax: Dutch concrete ZeroDut of Zero = { lincat S, NP, VP = Str ; V2 = {v : Str ; p : Str} ; lin Pred np vp = np ++ vp ; Compl v2 np = v2.v ++ np ++ v2.p ; John = \\"Jan\\" ; Mary = \\"Marie\\" ; Love = {v = \\"heeft\\" ; p = \\"lief\\"} ; } =Variable and inherent features, agreement, Unicode support= For Hebrew, NP has gender as its inherent feature a field in the record. VP has gender as its variable feature an argument of a table. In predication, the VP receives the gender of the NP. Concrete syntax: Hebrew concrete ZeroHeb of Zero = { flags coding=utf8 ; lincat S = Str ; NP = {s : Str ; g : Gender} ; VP, V2 = Gender => Str ; lin Pred np vp = np.s ++ vp ! np.g ; Compl v2 np = table {g => v2 ! g ++ \\"◊ê◊™\\" ++ np.s} ; John = {s = \\"◊í◊≥◊ï◊ü\\" ; g = Masc} ; Mary = {s = \\"◊û◊®◊ô\\" ; g = Fem} ; Love = table {Masc => \\"◊ê◊ï◊î◊ë\\" ; Fem => \\"◊ê◊ï◊î◊ë◊™\\"} ; param Gender = Masc  Fem ; } =Visualizing parse trees= GF has inbuilt functions which can be used for visualizing parse trees and word alignments. The following commands will generate parse trees for the given phrases and open the produced PNG image using the system's command. > parse -lang=Eng \\"John loves Mary\\"  visualize_parse -view=\\"eog\\" > parse -lang=Dut \\"Jan heeft Marie lief\\"  visualize_parse -view=\\"eog\\" {Parse tree for \\"John loves Mary\\"  Parse tree for \\"Jan heeft Marie lief\\" } =Generating word alignment= # In languages L1 and L2: link every word with its smallest spanning subtree. # Delete the intervening tree, combining links directly from L1 to L2. In general, this gives phrase alignment. Links can be crossing, phrases can be discontinuous. The command follows a similar syntax: > parse -lang=Fre \\"Marie aime Jean\\"  align_words -lang=Fre,Dut,Lat -view=\\"eog\\" Word alignment for \\"Marie aime Jean\\" in French, Dutch and Latin Resource Grammar Library In natural language applications, libraries are a way to cope with thousands of details involved in syntax, lexicon, and inflection. The GF Resource Grammar Library is the standard library for Grammatical Framework. It covers the morphology and basic syntax for an increasing number of languages, currently including Afrikaans, Amharic (partial), Arabic (partial), Basque (partial), Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Czech (partial), Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek ancient (partial), Greek modern, Hebrew (fragments), Hindi, Hungarian (partial), Interlingua, Italian, Japanese, Korean (partial), Latin (partial), Latvian, Maltese, Mongolian, Nepali, Norwegian bokm√•l, Norwegian nynorsk, Persian, Polish, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Sindhi, Slovak (partial), Slovene (partial), Somali (partial), Spanish, Swahili (fragments), Swedish, Thai, Turkish (fragments), and Urdu. In addition, 14 languages have WordNet lexicon and large-scale parsing extensionshttps://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-wordnet#readme. A full API documentation of the library can be found at the RGL Synopsis page. The RGL status document gives the languages currently available in the GF Resource Grammar Library, including their maturity. Uses of GF GF was first created in 1998 at Xerox Research Centre Europe, Grenoble, in the project Multilingual Document Authoring. At Xerox, it was used for prototypes including a restaurant phrase book, a database query system, a formalization of an alarm system instructions with translations to 5 languages, and an authoring system for medical drug descriptions. Later projects using GF and involving third parties include: * REMU: Reliable Multilingual Digital Communication, a project funded by the Swedish Research Council between 2013‚Äì2017. * MOLTO: multilingual online translation, an EU project that ran between 2010‚Äì2013. * SALDO: Swedish morphological dictionary based on rules developed for GF and Functional Morphology * WebAlt: multilingual generation of mathematical exercises (commercial project) * TALK: multilingual and multimodal spoken dialogue systems Academically, GF has been used in four PhD theses and resulted in around fifty scientific publications (see GF publication list). Commercially, GF has been used by a number of companies, in domains such as e-commerce, health care and translating formal specifications to natural language.https://www.digitalgrammars.com/customers Community=Developer mailing list= There is an active group for developers and users of GF alike, located at https://groups.google.com/group/gf-dev =Summer schools=2020 ‚Äì GF as a resource for Computational Law (Singapore) The seventh GF summer school, postponed due to COVID-19, is to be held in Singapore. Co-organised with the Singapore Management University's Centre for Computational Law, the summer school will have a special focus on computational law. 2018 ‚Äì Sixth GF Summer School (Stellenbosch, South Africa) The sixth GF summer school was the first one held outside Europe. The major themes of the summer school were African language resources, and the growing usage of GF in commercial applications. 2017 ‚Äì GF in a Full Stack of Language Technology (Riga, Latvia) The fifth GF summer school was held in Riga, Latvia. This summer school had a number of participant from startups, presenting industrial use cases of GF. 2016 ‚Äì Summer School in Rule-Based Machine Translation (Alicante, Spain) GF was one of the four platforms featured at the Summer School in Rule-Based Machine Translation, along with Apertium, Matxin and TectoMT. 2015 ‚Äì Fourth GF Summer School (Gozo, Malta) The fourth GF summer school was held on Gozo island in Malta. Like the previous edition in 2013, this summer school featured collaborations with other resources, such as Apertium and FrameNet. 2013 ‚Äì Scaling Up Grammatical Resources (Lake Chiemsee, Germany) The third GF Summer school, was held on Frauenchiemsee island in Bavaria, Germany with the special theme \\"Scaling up Grammar Resources\\". This summer school focused on extending the existing resource grammars with the ultimate goal of dealing with any text in the supported languages. Lexicon extension is an obvious part of this work, but also new grammatical constructions were also of interest. There was a special interest in porting resources from other open-source approaches, such as WordNets and Apertium, and reciprocally making GF resources easily reusable in other approaches. 2011 ‚Äì Frontiers of Multilingual Technologies (Barcelona, Spain) The second GF Summer school, subtitled Frontiers of Multilingual Technologies was held in 2011 in Barcelona, Spain. It was sponsored by CLT, the Centre for Language Technology of the University of Gothenburg, and by UPC, Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya. The School addressed new languages and also promoted ongoing work in those languages which are already under construction. Missing EU languages were especially encouraged. The school began with a 2-day GF tutorial, serving those interested in getting an introduction to GF or an overview of on-going work. All results of the summer school are available as open-source software released under the LGPL license. 2009 ‚Äì GF Summer School (Gothenburg, Sweden) Group photo from the 2009 GF Summer School in Gothenburg, Sweden The first GF summer school was held in 2009 in Gothenburg, Sweden. It was a collaborative effort to create grammars of new languages in Grammatical Framework, GF. These grammars were added to the Resource Grammar Library, which previously had 12 languages. Around 10 new languages are already under construction, and the School aimed to address 23 new languages. All results of the Summer School were made available as open-source software released under the LGPL license. The summer school was organized by the Language Technology Group at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. The group is a part of the Centre of Language Technology, a focus research area of the University of Gothenburg.

Born at her family's Castle Howard, she worked for the ordination of women, as well as being active in the ecumenical movement. She was remembered as \\"a great character, a great Christian woman and a formidable person\\" by the Archdeacon of York, George Austin, who was one her staunchest opponents on the ordination of women. Her grandmother, Rosalind Howard, Countess of Carlisle, had been a tireless worker for the women's suffrage organization - as a suffragist, wedded to legal means, rather than a suffragette - and Howard followed her example in her work to achieve the ordination of women to the priesthood. A founding member of the Movement for the Ordination of Women, she concentrated her major effort on the synodical process to secure the necessary legislation. In 1972 she wrote a report for General Synod entitled The Ordination of Women to Priesthood. She earned the Lambeth Diploma in Theology, was appointed a lay canon provincial of York Minster, served on General Synod 1970-85, was a delegate to the World Council of Churches (WCC) in 1961 and 1968, was appointed to the Faith and Order Commission of the WCC and served as the first woman vice-moderator.

Aid to Artisans mission is to create economic opportunities for low-income artisan groups around the world where livelihoods, communities, and craft traditions are marginal or at risk. ATA helps artisans in more than 110 countries raise the standard of living for their families and their communities by building profitable businesses inspired by handmade traditions. ATA offers artisans access to new markets, business training, eco-effective processes and design innovations through a network of partners to promote sustainable growth and community well-being. Network ATA has worked with prominent designers such as Jonathan Adler.www.jonathanadler.com/shop/about.php The work of ATA Colombia spawned an independent organization Fundaci√≥n Creata headed by Director Mauricio Rincon and Project Manager Julian Huerfano They joined ATA at the New York international Gift Fair in 2013. Similarly, in September 2010 ATA's field office in South Africa became the independent organization The Africa Craft Trust. History Aid to Artisans was founded in 1976 in Boston, Massachusetts by James S. Plaut, former Secretary General of the World Crafts Council (WCC), and his wife Mary. Working through ATA, their goal was to give artisans practical assistance selling their products thus providing them with sustainable streams of income. With this in mind, ATA began importing high quality crafts and selling them to museum stores in the United States under the assumption that this was the most fertile market for handcrafts.Lessons Learned In Twenty Years by Aid to Artisans However, in the early 1980s, ATA began moving away from the limited museum store market to a broader strategy of providing artisan groups with product development assistance, market links and business skills training: three services that remain at the core of the ATA model. At this time, ATA also started its Small Grants Program which gives artisans the means to improve their production capacity and quality by purchasing new equipment and materials. In 1986, James and Mary Plaut retired and ATA moved to Farmington, Connecticut, the home of its new President Clare Brett Smith, an experienced commercial crafts importer and photographer. In 2000, ATA moved to its current office in Hartford. ATA's first major project was funded by USAID in Honduras (1984-1986) and since then ATA has worked in over 110 countries throughout Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Over the past 10 years, ATA‚Äôs efforts have leveraged nearly $245 million in retail sales. This income has empowered 125,000 artisans in 41 emerging regions of the world and more than 70% of the artisans ATA works with are women. ATA currently works in 12 countries throughout Africa, Asia and Latin America, including Benin, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Chad, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Haiti, Morocco, Mali, Mexico and Tibet. In October, 2012, Aid to Artisans joined the Washington, DC based non-profit Creative Learning as its new signature program. Since its inception, Creative Learning has managed a host of innovative people-to-people projects that serve the needs of communities in developing countries, working to protect human rights, improve educational opportunities and build peace.

The main character of this series is Kurt Austin and Joe Zavala.  Summary  This is the first book with Cussler's new hero Kurt Austin. The main plot is about a group of men who call themselves \\"The Brotherhood\\" and have ties to a 15th-century religious order. The group in modern times has attempted to hide and destroy all evidence of pre-Columbian contact between the New and Old Worlds. The book begins with the wrecking of the ships SS Andrea Doria and MS Stockholm and moves to modern times with gun fights and chases from Boston and Washington DC to Africa and Mexico. The introduction of replacements for Dirk Pitt and his sidekick does not change Cussler's plot. In 1956, off the coast of Nantucket Island, a crew member of the Stockholm causes the collision with the Andrea Doria then disappears. After the collision, a waiter aboard the Andrea Doria witnesses the murder of several men beside an armored vehicle in the hold of the ship. Years later, Marine archaeologist Nina Kirov is exploring underwater ruins off an isolated stretch of the coast of Morocco. The structures she discovers seems to attest to an ancient Phoenician port. She also observes a large stone head which intrigues her. Via computer she contacts a friend, another archaeologist at the University of Pennsylvania, who confirms that nearly identical stone heads have been viewed in the Yucat√°n. Soon afterwards Nina, unable to sleep, slips out of camp. Returning to camp, she witnesses an armed force execute all the team members still in the camp. The assassins sight Nina and give chase. She eventually literally swims for her life, but a hovercraft pursues her with the obvious intention of killing her. A hand on her ankle yanks her beneath the surface of the sea. Kurt Austin, a diver from an offshore NUMA ship shares his auxiliary oxygen tank and saves her from certain death. Returning with Moroccan authorities, Nina discovers that all evidence of the camp and its residents has been obliterated. The stone head has been destroyed. There is yet more bad news: her friend at Penn has been killed. A later attack by the armed force on the ship imperils the lives of all aboard, but Kurt, his friend Joe Zavala, and the captain of the ship manage to outwit and defeat the would- be assassins. Back in the USA, a meeting which includes Kurt, Joe, and Nina investigates the surprising number of archaeological teams that have disappeared. The sole connection of all the incidents seems to be a non-profit volunteer organization called Time-Quest, a part of Halcon Industries. Meanwhile, another NUMA operative Gamay Trout is investigating some unusual Mayan ruins. She meets scientist/archaeologist Dr. Chi in the Yucat√°n, but they are confronted by chicleros, lawless men who steal Mayan artifacts. Her husband goes searching for her when she disappears. Through amazing feats Gamay and Dr Chi barely escape and meet up with her husband. All these events seem connected and point to a fiendish plot by Halcon. Secrets in the long- distant past hold the key.

After his debut in his native Tbilisi in 1976, he embarked on a 35-year-long musical career during which he made appearances at leading opera houses across Europe and the United States. Through his foundation, he became involved in children charity in Georgia in 2004. From May to December 2016, Burchuladze briefly entered politics of Georgia, founding the political party State for the People to challenge the incumbent Georgian Dream coalition government in the scheduled October 2016 parliamentary election, in which the party failed to win any seat in the legislature. Since July 2017, Burchuladze has been leading the opera division of Moscow's Mikhailovsky Theatre, one of Russia's oldest opera and ballet houses.  Musical career  Born in Tbilisi, the capital of then-Soviet Georgia, he graduated from the Tbilisi State Conservatoire and continued his studies at the Bolshoi school. He made a student debut in Tbilisi in 1976 and then took part in several singing competitions, including at the Bolshoi in Moscow, where he sang in Boris Godunov. Early in his career, Burchuladze sang Leporello (Don Giovanni), Prince Gremin (Eugene Onegin), and King Rene (Iolanta) for the Tbilisi Opera House. Burchuladze was further trained in Milan from 1978 to 1981 and sang Banquo, Pagano (I Lombardi), Walter (Luisa Miller) and Zaccaria (Nabucco) at La Scala. During his career, which spanned more than three decades, Burchuladze made appearances across the world's leading opera houses. He debuted at the Covent Garden in 1984 as Ramfis (Aida) and then appeared as Don Basilio (The Barber of Seville), Khan Konchak (Prince Igor), Boris Godunov, and the Inquisitor (Fiery Angel). His United States debut was at Philadelphia, in 1987, as Boris. He also sang Basilio, Boris, and the Commendatore (Don Giovanni) at the Metropolitan. His other notable roles are Silva (Ernani), Fiesco (Simon Boccanegra), Philip II, Boito's Mefistofele, and Dosifey (Khovanshchina). He also made several recordings. According to the musicologist Elizabeth Forbes, Burchuladze's \\"magnificent dark-toned voice and imposing stature are ideal for both the Russian repertory and Giuseppe Verdi's bass roles\\". He has also been described by classical music critics as acting \\"sly, gravelly\\", being \\"imposing\\", and \\"wonderfully menacing\\". Burchuladze announced he was leaving music to focus on his new political role in May 2016.  Charity work and civil activities  Burchuladze set up the charity foundation Iavnana in January 2004 and through it organized dozens of concerts and events to support vulnerable children and families in Georgia. He was the United Nations Goodwill Ambassador in 2006 and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in Georgia in 2010. In November 2015, Burchuladze established the Georgian Development Foundation, a civic movement, which was expected to turn into a political party ahead of the scheduled October 2016 parliamentary election. Burchuladze emphasized that his new organization was not a political party and described it as a pro-democracy and pro-Western advocacy group. He set up offices in Washington and Los Angeles with the declared aim to raise awareness of Georgia in the United States, whose help, according to Burchuladze, was essential in reducing threats coming from Russia. A March 2016 opinion poll commissioned by the International Republican Institute showed Burchuladze's Georgian Development Foundation as being not too far behind from the ruling Georgian Dream coalition and the main opposition United National Movement, garnering 12%, 19%, and 18%, respectively. On 12 May 2016, Burchuladze announced the foundation of a new political organization, State for the People, and his intention to take part in the upcoming parliamentary election. Two months after the party's failure in the election, in December 2016, Burchuladze announced his withdrawal from politics and return to opera. In July 2017, Burchuladze became the director of the opera division of the Moscow-based Mikhailovsky Theater, one of Russia's oldest opera and ballet houses.

Life Berendt's father Ernst Berendt was a Protestant pastor belonging to the Confessing Church and was imprisoned and died in the Dachau concentration camp. J.-E. Berendt started studying Physics, but was interrupted by his enlistment to the Wehrmacht. Already during the Nazi Germany years Berendt took an interest in jazz, which then had retreated to the underground. After World War II he helped founding the S√ºdwestfunk (SWF) radio network in the then French occupation zone of Germany. From 1950 till his retirement in 1987 he was in charge of the jazz department of the SWF. In 1952 the first German edition of Berendt's Jazz Book was published. It became a definitive book on jazz translated into many languages and is still being updated and reprinted. For almost 40 years Berendt produced the jazz program of the Baden-Baden station of the German public radio and TV network ARD. His weekly TV show Jazztime Baden-Baden and his daily radio shows were pioneer work in advancing and popularizing jazz in post-war Germany. Berendt later focused on world music and was one of its early promoters. Berendt initiated and organized many jazz festivals (American Folk Blues Festival, Berliner Jazztage, World Expo Osaka). He was the producer of many records, mainly for MPS Records, and supported the Jazz & Lyrik project, combining jazz performances with readings of poetry (not jazz poetry). Berendt was awarded, amongst others, the critic's award of German television, the culture award of Poland, and twice the Bundesfilmpreis. Berendt died on 4 February 2000 at the age of 77 after a traffic accident which he was involved in as a pedestrian. The accident happened in Hamburg, Berendt was on his way to a book promotion for his book Es gibt keinen Weg nur Gehen (There Is No Way, Only Going). Berendt's huge collection of records, books, magazines, photos and more is in the archive of the Jazzinstitut Darmstadt. Later work In 1983 Berendt published The World Is Sound: Nada Brahma and The Third Ear: On Listening to the World. In these books Berendt investigates in listening in general, i.e. its medical, historical, physical, cultural and philosophical aspects.

The first service in the church building, designed by Scottish architect John Notman, was held on March 27, 1859. The corner tower was added in 1867 and was designed by George W. Hewitt of the firm of Fraser, Furness & Hewitt. It is designed in the simpler \\"low church\\" style, rather than the fancier \\"high church\\" or Anglo-Catholic style of Notman's nearby St. Marks Episcopal Church. The church's rector from 1862 to 1869 was Phillips Brooks, probably most famous as the author of the lyrics to the familiar Christmas carol \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem\\". Renowned (and sometimes reviled) for his ebullient homilies and his staunch opposition to slavery, Brooks delivered a eulogy to Abraham Lincoln in the church on April 23, 1865, following the U.S. President's assassination on April 14. This sermon was reprinted and widely read. After the end of the American Civil War, Brooks took a sabbatical from the church to travel to Europe, Israel and Palestine. His visit to Bethlehem inspired him to write a poem for his Sunday School students, and for the church's 1868 Christmas season he had church organist Louis Redner set the poem to music. The result was ‚ÄúO Little Town of Bethlehem.\\" In 1869, Brooks became rector of Trinity Church, Boston, where he oversaw the design, decoration and construction of Trinity's new Back Bay facility from 1872 to 1877 following the original church's destruction in Boston's Great Fire of 1872. The church's rector from 1899 to his death in 1932 was rev. Floyd W. Tomkins. Philadelphia's Church of the Holy Trinity is also known for its numerous stained-glass windows, including five by Louis Comfort Tiffany and one by Luc-Olivier Merson. Skylight over the altar The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Today, the Church of the Holy Trinity's mission is, \\"In the name of Christ to deepen our faith, to enlarge our community and to act on our beliefs.\\" Sunday services are at 8:30 and 11am; with a special service for children and families called \\"Joyful Noise\\" at 9:45 on the first Sunday of the month. CHT is a welcoming and affirming community where all are welcome.

The name has been explained as an allusion to the submission that Muslims owe to God (Allah). Meyer dismisses this as \\"efforts by propagandists [to] explain the term away [that are] at the least, disingenuous\\". The term is widely used in the Middle East and North Africa by Arabs in reference to black people, this is due to the historical legacy of the Arab Slave Trade wherein black people from East Africa were bought or captured, enslaved and sold by Arabs. Usage in Sudan There have been instances of Northern Sudanese using the terms \\"Abid\\" or \\"Abeed\\" to refer to Southern Sudanese (mostly Dinka and Nuer). In Sudan they're considered the \\"Slave tribe\\" because of the Trans- Saharan slave trade. This usage is considered derogatory and has fallen into relative disuse over the years. Southern Sudanese in turn refer to Northerners as \\"Mundukuru\\" and \\"Minga\\". According to Professor Mahmoud Mamdani however, conflicts in Sudan are not compatible with western pre-conceptions of \\"race\\". Francis Deng described the north-south division imposed by the British on Anglo-Egyptian Sudan as the British saying to the Northerners: \\"You Northerners are slave traders and you treat the Southerners like Abeed. Don't call them Abeed! They are slaves no longer.\\" Jok Madut Jok argued that the Sudanese slave trade persists in the 21st century. He claimed that Southern Sudanese who work in Northern Sudan at marginal and petty jobs are regarded as Abeed because of the social standing that is concomitant with such occupations. Dinka labourers earning just enough to buy food are treated as the property of landowners and merchants. \\"Displaced Southerners,\\" Jok states, \\"are at the bottom of the racial hierarchy in Northern Sudan.\\" He explains that they depend upon patronage and exploitative relationships with power brokers, with relations ranging from servitude through bonded work to serving as attractants for resources from foreign aid agencies. \\"The lines dividing slavery and cheap labor\\", he states, \\"are blurred.\\" See also *List of ethnic slurs  References  Category:Anti-African and anti-black slurs Category:Anti-black racism in Africa Category:Anti-black racism in Asia Category:Arab society Category:Stereotypes of black people Category:Racism in the Arab world Category:Slavery Category:Sudanese society ","title":"Abeed"},{"id":"10372247","text":"Steve or Stephen Sparks may refer to: *Robert Stephen John Sparks (born 1949), British volcanologist *Steve Sparks (pitcher, born 1965), Major League Baseball pitcher, 1995‚Äì2004 and Houston Astros radio broadcaster *Steve Sparks (pitcher, born 1975), MLB pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates, 2000 ","title":"Steve Sparks"},{"id":"10372309","text":"Levance E.

Based in Monroe, Louisiana from 1997 until the end of the 2001 season, the team played its home games at the Monroe Civic Center.  History  Monroe was awarded an expansion franchise in May 1997 slated to begin play that October. After early troubles with ownership and securing home ice at the civic center, the team would begin the season by going 4-3 on the road before playing their first home game before a sold out crowd on November 8. Coached by Rob Bremner, the team would see moderate success for their inaugural season finishing one game out of the playoffs and averaging 3,178 fans per game. Prior to the 1998-99 season, permanent ice was installed at the civic center allowing for the team to remain in Monroe. On the ice, the squad would see the franchise's first playoff berth. However with declining attendance, Rob Bremner was relieved of his coaching duties following the season. For the 1999-00 season, former Moccasin Brian Curran was selected as head coach. Playing a more aggressive style, the team would advance once again to the playoffs where they would subsequently lose in the first round to Arkansas. Leading into the 2000-01 season, the future of the franchise came into question as a result of the continual decline in attendance. By February 2000, the team was being kept afloat by the league itself. After falling short in securing 2,500 season tickets for the 2001-02 season, the team would cease operation that June.

Later, he became a fashion and lifestyle photographer for U.S. magazines. Biography Michelantonio Celestino Onofrio Vaccaro was born in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, on December 20, 1922, to Italian immigrant parents. He was the second of their three children and the only boy. His father Giuseppe Antonio Vaccaro (b. October 14, 1874) was from Bonefro in the Molise region of Italy. In 1926, in the course of the family relocating to Italy, both his parents died; he was raised in Italy by his paternal grandmother where he was physically abused by his father's brother. With the outbreak of World War II, Vaccaro moved back to the United States in order to escape military service in Italy. He graduated from Isaac E. Young High School in New Rochelle, New York, in 1943, and was drafted a few months later into the U.S. Army. He sought an assignment as a photographer with the Army Signal Corps offering photographs taken in high school as evidence of his talent. He was rejected because of his age. Vaccaro, left, at a ceremony marking the 70th anniversary of D Day, June 7, 2014 Instead, Vaccaro was sent to Europe as a private in the 83rd Infantry Division of the U.S. Army. He fought in Normandy, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Germany. His usual position as a scout provided him with the opportunity to take photographs with the Argus C3 compact 35mm rangefinder camera that he was adept at using. In September 1945, he was discharged from the army. Vaccaro stayed in Germany, where he obtained a job first as a photographer for Audio Visual Aids (AVA) stationed at Frankfurt, and then with Weekend, the Sunday supplement of the U.S. Army newspaper Stars and Stripes. Until 1949, Vaccaro photographed throughout Germany and Europe, documenting post-war life. After his return to the U.S. in 1949, he worked for Flair and Look before joining the magazine Life. Between 1950 and 1973 Vaccaro worked extensively as a celebrity and fashion photographer. He settled in the West Village in 1951 and then on Central Park West in 1955. From 1970 to 1980 he taught photography at Cooper Union. In 1979 he moved both his residence and studio along with his archive of hundreds of thousands of images, to Long Island City. He continued to spend his summers in Rome. He married Anja Kyllikki (1939‚Äì2013), a Finnish model, in 1963. They had two sons and separated in 1979. They met when Vaccaro was shooting a series about Marimekko for Life. Although some 4,000 of his photographs were lost in an accident in 1947, photographs from his extensive wartime archive were published in 2001 in his book, Entering Germany: Photographs 1944-1949 and 2002 in the book Shots of War. In 1994, he was awarded the French at the celebrations marking the fiftieth anniversary of the Normandy landings.Goepel, K.: Bild-Ikonen zum Kriegsende: Tony Vaccaro s Werk, Icons , AKG-Images, August 15, 2005.

Prince Alexander Leopold Franz Emmerich of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsf√ºrst (17 August 1794 ‚Äì 17 November 1849) was a German priest and reputed miracle-worker. Early life and education Alexander of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsf√ºrst was born at Kupferzell, near Waldenburg. He was a son of Charles Albert II, Prince of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsf√ºrst (1742-1796) and his second wife, Hungarian Baroness Judith Reviczky of Revi≈°n√© (from 1753 to 1836), the daughter of a Hungarian nobleman. They entrusted his early education to the church and ex-Jesuit Rid. In 1804, he entered the Theresianum at Vienna, in 1808 the academy at Bern, in 1810 the archiepiscopal seminary at Vienna, and afterwards he studied at Tyrnau and Ellwangen. Career He was ordained priest in 1815, and in the following year he went to Rome. While in Rome, he entered the society of the Fathers of the Sacred Heart. Subsequently, in Munich and Bamberg, he was blamed for Jesuit and Obscurantist tendencies, but obtained considerable reputation as a preacher. Alexander's first so-called miraculous cure was effected, in conjunction with a peasant, Martin Michel, on Princess Mathilde von Schwarzenberg, who had been paralytic for some years. Immediately he acquired such fame as a performer of miraculous cures that crowds from several countries flocked to partake of the beneficial influence of his supposed supernatural gifts. Ultimately, on account of the interference of the authorities with his operations, he went to Vienna in 1821 and then to Hungary, where he became a canon of Grosswardein and in 1844 titular Bishop of Sardica. In 1849, he died at V√∂slau near Vienna. Alexander was the author of a number of ascetic and controversial writings, which were collected and published in one edition by S. Brunner in 1851.

Witcher was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the 8th round (119th overall) of the 1966 NFL Draft. At Witcher was a wide receiver who first played two years at Bakersfield College, then graduated from UCLA. Witcher played in 8 NFL seasons from 1966 to 1973 for the 49ers. Witcher was a backup to Dave Parks and Bernie Casey during his rookie season. After Casey was traded to the Los Angeles Rams in 1967, Witcher moved into the starting lineup and led the 49ers with 46 receptions. Witcher followed up with 39 receptions in 1968. Witcher started 1969 as a backup to Gene Washington and Clifton McNeil, but by the 6th game he moved back into the starting lineup ahead of McNeil. He ended up with 33 receptions in 1969. Against Cleveland in 1970, Witcher suffered his most serious injury of his career, a separated shoulder. He missed 3 games, the only games missed in his 49er career. With John Brodie having an MVP season and the 49ers with a solid defense, the team won its division with a 10‚Äì3‚Äì1 record, qualifying for the playoffs. At Minnesota, Witcher caught a 24-yard TD in the 17‚Äì14 upset win over the Vikings. Witcher scored the 49ers lone TD the following week against the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC Championship Game at Kezar Stadium. After an 18 reception season in 1971, the 49ers looked to upgrade the wide receiver position opposite Gene Washington. Terry Beasley from Auburn was the 49ers 1st draft pick in the 1972 NFL Draft. However, Witcher opened the season as the 49ers starting receiver. By now, he was also the 49ers backup tight end, replacing the traded Bob Windsor. After 6 games, Witcher had only 2 receptions and was replaced with Preston Riley. In the final game of the season against Minnesota, the 49ers needed a win to qualify for the playoffs. Down 17‚Äì6 in the 4th quarter, Brodie came off the bench after an injury to throw 2 TD passes to win the game and the division title. The second TD was a 2-yard rollout pass to Witcher in the final seconds of the game. It was one of the great 49ers moments of their history to that point. After the 1973 season, Witcher signed with the Southern California Sun of the WFL. He was traded to the Chicago Bears during training camp, but was cut by the Bears. In his first game with the Sun, Witcher scored the winning TD with a reception against the Detroit Wheels. After a few games, Witcher left the Sun and was done with professional football.

It runs diagonally through Saint Paul, connecting with Interstate 35E at its southeast terminus, and feeds into Selby Avenue at its northwest end. Indirect access to I-94 is possible via Selby and Snelling Avenues. Originally known as the Short Line Road, it was renamed in 1987 for John Ayd, a German settler who maintained a mill and residence in the area in the mid-to-late 19th century. History The foundation of the roadway dates back to the 1870s when the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad acquired the right-of-way of the stream bed to lay down tracks. The \\"Short Line,\\" as it was called, was one of the main interurban routes that served Saint Paul and its railroad suburbs on its way to Minneapolis at the turn of the 20th century. With the advent of the TCRT streetcar system in the 1910s, the line was redundant and was converted to heavy rail by the CMSPP, though it still carried passenger trains between the Saint Paul Union Depot and the Milwaukee Road Depot in neighboring Minneapolis. In the 1960s, the city of Saint Paul began construction on the Short Line Road, envisioning a below-grade, limited access direct link between I-35E and I-94. However, local opposition in the Merriam Park neighborhood, coupled with the stunted construction of I-35E due to opposition from the Summit Hill neighborhood, kept the vision from being a reality. A connection was made at grade with Selby Avenue, but the connection with I-35E was not made at this time, forcing southbound travelers to exit on Jefferson Avenue when the road first opened in 1965. =Connection with I-35E= For most of its life, Ayd Mill Road was un-striped, and very little traffic was seen on it. In the summer of 1992, the Saint Paul public works department temporarily linked Ayd Mill Road to I-35E to help mitigate traffic congestion during the completion of the interstate in the downtown area, after which the link was barricaded. In the late 1990s the city again revisited the prospect of the I-35E-to-I-94 connection as part of an environmental study as one of many options for the public right-of-way. Other options included replacing the entire stretch of road with a park. In the end, the city decided the best option was a rebuilt roadway that extended north along the railroad to St. Anthony Avenue, where a connection to I-94 was possible. Though renewed neighborhood protest has blocked this measure, the road has been blacktopped and striped, and the I-35E ramps were reopened after signals were put on Ayd Mill's entrance ramps. While in the middle of the Environmental Impact Statement, Mayor Randy Kelly opened the Ayd Mill to I-35E ramps as a temporary test in 2002, and those ramps have remained open ever since. The Saint Paul City Council twice passed resolutions in support of reducing lanes to a two- lane parkway (once in 2000, and again in 2009). Current status The adjacent track is still used today by Canadian Pacific and Amtrak's Empire Builder runs on these rails. In 2019 the Saint Paul City Council approved mill and overlaying the road in its current configuration for $3.5 million. Mayor Melvin Carter requested turning two lanes into a greenway but that plan would have cost $9.8 million due to drainage problems. The corridor is built on a buried stream which causes drainage and pavement preservation challenges. The council ultimately approved a $7.5 million construction project that reduced lanes from four to three and added a protected bicycle and pedestrian trail. NotesReferences *Empson, Donald.

The company had created WeeWorld.com, formally known as a social networking site, to which was mostly geared towards teens and tweens. The website is also known for its brand of instant messaging and chat-based avatars, known as ‚ÄúWeeMees‚Äù, Which was also released on a variety of digital platforms and services. There were approximately 180 million WeeMees created worldwide, but the site was unexpectedly shut down, as of 11 May 2017. From then on, there has not been anymore information from WeeWorld or the company itself. It is said that the company could no longer profit off of WeeWorld, and the only option left was to sell it to the new owners, who had then decided to shut it down. WeeMees= Description = WeeMees are two-dimensional cartoon avatars that WeeWorld users are issued when first joining the community. Users can purchase virtual goods for their avatars, such as clothing, accessories, and food and drink items. As WeeWorld's target demographic is teenagers, many of the virtual goods reflect current pop culture and celebrity fashion trends. Promotions and partnership WeeWorld has partnered with corporations such as AOL, MSN and Skype. Through a partnership with RCA, it has promoted artists such as Alicia Keys and Avril Lavigne through virtual merchandise sales and WeeMees of the respective artists. WeeWorld has also promoted artists such as the Jonas Brothers, Justin Timberlake, Raven-Symon√©, the Pussycat Dolls, Justin Bieber, and Taylor Swift.  History  The avatars were created in 2001 by the Co-Founders of Saw-You.com, Mike Kinsella and John McGuire in Glasgow, Scotland. In 2003, Microsoft began offering the avatars for use to their Hotmail customers via the MSN chat service. The new service attracted 150,000 users during the first day of the avatars being launched, with the WeeMee website attracting 1.5 million hits daily. In 2004 the UK's largest social network, Friendsreunited.com, also introduced the WeeMee to their user base. In December 2008 the virtual technology firm DA agreed to develop a 3-D version of the avatar. The company was run by a rookie CEO, Celia Francis and went into liquidation in 2014. Was then sold to Glasgow business Opinurate, who closed the website down in 2017. As of September 2020, the website (weeworld.com) is now listed as being for sale.

An overloaded balcony collapsed during a party in an apartment building, killing thirteen people and seriously injuring fifty-seven others. The ensuing investigation was highly critical of the way the balcony was built, finding a large number of errors in its construction which ultimately resulted in the collapse. However, the building's owner, LG Properties, and its president, Philip Pappas, continues to blame overcrowding on the balcony for its complete structural failure, although he has taken steps to strengthen the balconies at other properties to prevent a recurrence of the disaster. The accident resulted in sweeping inspections of similar structures across Chicago, with 1,260 cases being acted on by the city authorities. Background The porch was attached to the rear of an apartment building located in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of the city's North Side.Chicago balcony collapse kills 12 - BBC News - Obtained March 30, 2007. The second and third floors were being used as a party venue at the time of the collapse.I thought I'd die, says balcony collapse woman - BreakingNews.ie - Obtained March 30, 2007. Most of the party-goers were in their early 20s, and knew each other from their days at New Trier High School and Lake Forest High School of Chicago's North Shore suburbs. One witness says she warned other people in the building that the balconies were unsafe, but another later said that \\"it looked like it was newly built. It looked sturdy.\\" Collapse About fifty people were on the top wooden balcony at the time of the collapse. According to one witness, the sound of splintering wood was heard immediately before the collapse, which occurred shortly after midnight local time. The collapse started on the third floor, pulling down other balconies below. The first, second, and third floor balconies all collapsed into the basement below, carrying a total of approximately one hundred people among them.Without Warning, Chaos - Who's To Blame For A Chicago Porch Collapse That Killed 13 People? - CBS News - Obtained March 30, 2007. Several people were also trapped in a basement stairwell. Survivors helped to pull victims out from under the debris of the balconies, and rescue workers had to use chainsaws to free others. One of the survivors was a nurse, and had started a rescue effort before the emergency services arrived. The Chicago Fire Department supplied the main rescue effort. Eleven people were killed in the collapse, with two more subsequently dying while hospitalized; fifty-seven people were injured.City officials sue Chicago building owner over porch collapse - USA Today - Obtained March 30, 2007. The porch and balconies also had kegs of beer and old refrigerators, an old clothes washer and dryer. As the party-goers rocked the stairs and landings up and down to the music, it all fell all three floors into the basement concrete stairwells. Advocate Hospital ER went on \\"bypass\\" and more than 75 people made their way walking and limping south on Halsted to Children's Memorial Hospital, which also went on \\"bypass\\". Investigation Initial inquiries suggested that the collapse was probably due to overcrowding. This was backed up by neighbors, who told authorities that the balconies were designed to hold only between twenty and thirty people. Chicago's fire chief said that \\"It appears to be a case of too many people in a small space.\\" Norma Reyes, the city's building commissioner, said \\"I have no indication of any substandard problems or insufficiencies with the porch at this time. The buildings are not made for large assemblies and parties.\\" However, it was ultimately determined that poor construction was to blame. In 1998, a permit was issued to owner LG Properties to install furnaces, air conditioners and water heaters in the building, but not to build the balcony. The balcony jutted out eleven feet from the building, one foot farther than permitted by city codes, and had an area of , larger than permitted. The balcony also had inadequate supports, was floored with undersized lengths of wood, and was attached to the walls with screws that were too short. However, the City of Chicago's Inspectional Services Department visited this site over 5 times and never noticed or cited the code violations noted above. Aftermath Three days after the disaster, the city sued the owners and managers of the building in the Housing Court due to a number of breaches in building regulations. Those named in the complaint included LG Properties, the company's president Philip Pappas, and George Koutroumos, the contractor who built the balcony. The city was reportedly seeking $500 per violation for each day the structure was in existence, totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars, and a court order for the replacement of the balcony. The apartment block was legally uninhabitable until the balconies were replaced, as they provided mandatory emergency exits. The city's Buildings Department inspected 42 other buildings owned or managed by Pappas and/or LG Properties for similar violations. The city also claimed that 21 other buildings owned by Pappas had similar problems. They did, however, note the fact that he had since made \\"dramatic improvements\\" to all 21 porches. In the aftermath of the disaster, Chicago inspected a large number of similar structures to ensure they were safe, with 500 cases being turned over to the city's Law Department for court action, and 760 cases referred to administrative hearing officers.City steps up porch checks in year since tragedy - Chicago Sun-Times - Obtained March 30, 2007. Pappas continued to blame overcrowding for the disaster. However, an undercover press investigation discovered all his properties now display notices forbidding parties on the balconies. Pappas also claims that a police report says two unnamed witnesses informed a paramedic that they saw several people \\"jumping up and down\\" on the balconies shortly prior to the collapse. In 2005, the city of Chicago filed a negligence lawsuit against two of the survivors, William Fenton-Hathaway and John Koranda. The city alleged that the balcony collapse occurred after defendants Fenton-Hathaway and Koranda \\"intentionally and negligently\\" began jumping up and down on the porch.http://media.www.dailyvidette.com/media/storage/paper420/news/2005/02/08/News/City- Blames.Men.For.Porch.Collapse-856122.shtml Koranda's brother, Robert Koranda, was killed in the collapse. The charges against Fenton-Hathaway and Koranda were later dropped. No criminal charges were filed and Pappas was fined a total of $108,000 as a result of the collapse. Twenty-seven families sued Pappas and the city over the accident. The balcony was rebuilt afterwards, this time with metal.

The elements of Albanian mythology are of Paleo-Balkanic origin and almost all of them are pagan. Albanian folklore evolved over the centuries in a relative isolated tribal culture and society. Albanian folk tales and legends have been orally transmitted down the generations and are still very much alive in the mountainous regions of Albania, Kosovo and western North Macedonia, among the Arb√´resh√´ in Italy and the Arvanites in Greece.; . In Albanian mythology, the physical phenomena, elements and objects are attributed to supernatural beings. The deities are generally not persons, but personifications of nature, which is animated.; . The earliest attested cult of the Albanians is the worship of the Sun and the Moon. In Albanian folk beliefs, earth is the object of a special cult,; and an important role is played by fire, which is considered a living, sacred or divine element used for rituals, sacrificial offerings and purification.; Fire worship is associated with the cult of the Sun, the cult of the hearth and the cult of fertility in agriculture and animal husbandry.; ; . Beja is a common practice in Albanian culture, consisting of an oath taken by Sun, by Moon, by sky, by earth, by fire, by stone, by mountain, by water and by snake, which are all considered sacred objects.; ; ; ; . The cult of the Sun and the Moon also appears in Albanian legends and folk art.; ; Albanian myths and legends are organized around the dichotomy of good and evil,; the most famous representation of which is the legendary battle between drangue and kulshedra, a conflict that symbolyzes the cyclic return in the watery and chthonian world of death, accomplishing the cosmic renewal of rebirth. The weavers of destiny, ora or fat√≠, control the order of the universe and enforce its laws.; A very common motif in Albanian folk narrative is metamorphosis: men morph into deer, wolves, owls; while women morph into stoats, cuckoos, turtles. Among the main bodies of Albanian folk poetry there are the K√¢ng√´ Kreshnik√´sh (\\"Songs of Heroes\\"), the traditional non-historical cycle of Albanian epic songs, based on the cult of the legendary hero.  Documentation =Albanian collectors= Arb√´resh writer Girolamo de Rada (1814‚Äì1903). Franciscan priest and scholar Shtjef√´n Gje√ßovi (1874‚Äì1929). Albanian myths and legends are already attested in works written in Albanian as early as the 15th century, however, the systematic collection of Albanian folklore material began only in the 19th century. One of the first Albanian collectors from Italy was the Arb√´resh writer Girolamo De Rada who‚Äîalready imbued with a passion for his Albanian lineage in the first half of the 19th century‚Äîbegan collecting folklore material at an early age. Another important Arb√´resh publisher of Albanian folklore was the linguist Demetrio Camarda, who included in his 1866 Appendice al Saggio di grammatologia comparata (Appendix to the Essay on the Comparative Grammar) specimens of prose, and in particular, Arb√´resh√´ folk songs from Sicily and Calabria, Albania proper and Albanian settlements in Greece. De Rada and Camarda were the two main initiators of the Albanian nationalist cultural movement in Italy. In Greece, the Arvanite writer Anastas Kullurioti published Albanian folklore material in his 1882 Albanikon alfav√™tarion / Avabatar arb√´ror (Albanian Spelling Book). The Albanian National Awakening (Rilindja) gave rise to collections of folklore material in Albania in the second half of the 19th century. One of the early Albanian collectors of Albanian folklore from Albania proper was Zef Jubani. From 1848 he served as interpreter to French consul in Shkodra, Louis Hyacinthe H√©cquard, who was very interested in folklore and decided to prepare a book on northern Albanian folklore. They travelled through the northern Albanian mountains and recorded folklore material which were published in French translation in the 1858 H√©cquard's pioneering Histoire et description de la Haute Albanie ou Gu√©garie (History and Description of High Albania or Gegaria‚Äù). Jubani's own first collection of folklore‚Äîthe original Albanian texts of the folk songs published by H√©cquard‚Äîwas lost in the flood that devastated the city of Shkodra on 13 January 1866. Jubani published in 1871 his Raccolta di canti popolari e rapsodie di poemi albanesi (Collection of Albanian Folk Songs and Rhapsodies)‚Äîthe first collection of Geg folk songs and the first folkloristik work to be published by an Albanian who lived in Albania. Another important Albanian folklore collector was Thimi Mitko, a prominent representative of the Albanian community in Egypt. He began to take an interest in folklore in 1859 and started recording Albanian folklore material from the year 1866, providing also folk songs, riddles and tales for Demetrio Camarda's collection. Mitko's own collection of Albanian folklore‚Äîincluding 505 folk songs, and 39 tales and popular sayings, mainly from southern Albania‚Äîwas finished in 1874 and published in the 1878 Greek-Albanian journal Alvaniki melissa / Belietta Sskiypetare (The Albanian Bee). This compilation was a milestone of Albanian folk literature being the first collection of Albanian folklore material of scholarly interest. Indeed, Mitko compiled and classified the material according to genres, including sections on fairy tales, fables, anecdotes, children's songs, songs of seasonal festivities, love songs, wedding songs, funerary songs, epic and historical songs. Mitko realized his collection collaborating with Spiro Risto Dine who emigrated to Egypt in 1866. Dino published himself Val√´t e Detit (The Waves of the Sea), which at the time of its publication in 1908 was the longest book printed in the Albanian language. The second part of Dine's collection was devoted to folk literature, including love songs, wedding songs, funerary songs, satirical verse, religious and didactic verses, folk tales, aphorisms, rhymes, popular beliefs and mythology. The first Albanian folklorist to collect oral tradition in a more systematic manner for scholarly purposes was the Franciscan priest and scholar Shtjef√´n Gje√ßovi. Two other Franciscan priests, Bernardin Palaj and Donat Kurti, along with Gje√ßovi, collected folk songs on their travels through the northern Albanian mountains and wrote articles on Gheg Albanian folklore and tribal customs. Palaj and Kurti published in 1937‚Äîon the 25th anniversary of Albanian independence‚Äîthe most important collection of Albanian epic verse, K√¢ng√´ kreshnik√´sh dhe legenda (Songs of the Frontier Warriors and Legends), in the series called Visaret e Kombit (The Treasures of the Nation). From the second half of the 20th century much research has been done by the Academy of Albanological Studies of Tirana and by the Albanological Institute of Prishtina. Albanian scholars have published numerous collections of Albanian oral tradition, but only a little part of this material has been translated into other languages. A substantial contribution in this direction has been made by the Albanologist Robert Elsie. =Foreign collectors= British anthropologist and writer Edith Durham (1863‚Äì1944). Foreign scholars first provided Europe with Albanian folklore in the second half of the 19th century, and thus set the beginning for the scholarly study of Albanian oral tradition. Albanian folk songs and tales were recorded by the Austrian consul in Janina, Johann Georg von Hahn, who travelled throughout Albania and the Balkans in the middle of the 19th century and in 1854 he published Albanesische Studien (Albanian Studies). The German physician Karl H. Reinhold collected Albanian folklore material from Albanian sailors while he was serving as a doctor in the Greek navy and in 1855 he published Noctes Pelasgicae (Pelasgian Nights). The folklorist Giuseppe Pitr√® published in 1875 a selection of Albanian folk tales from Sicily in Fiabe, novelle e racconti popolari siciliani (Sicilian Fables, Short Stories and Folk Tales). The next generation of scholars who became interested in collecting Albanian folk material were mainly philologists, among them the Indo-European linguists concerned about the study of the then little known Albanian language. The French consul in Janina and Thessalonika, Auguste Dozon, published Albanian folk tales and songs initially in the 1879 (Manual of the Shkip or Albanian Language) and in the 1881 Contes albanais, recueillis et traduits (Albanian Tales, Collected and Translated). The Czech linguist and professor of Romance languages and literature, Jan Urban Jarnik, published in 1883 Albanian folklore material from the region of Shkodra in Zur albanischen Sprachenkunde (On Albanian Linguistics) and P≈ô√≠spƒõvky ku pozn√°n√≠ n√°≈ôeƒç√≠ alb√°nsk√Ωch uve≈ôej≈àuje (Contributions to the Knowledge of Albanian Dialects). The German linguist and professor at the University of Graz, Gustav Meyer, published in 1884 fourteen Albanian tales in Albanische M√§rchen (Albanian Tales), and a selection of Tosk tales in the 1888 Albanian grammar (1888). His folklore material was republished in his Albanesische Studien (Albanian Studies). Danish Indo-Europeanist and professor at the University of Copenhagen, Holger Pedersen, visited Albania in 1893 to learn the language and to gather linguistic material. He recorded thirty-five Albanian folk tales from Albania and Corfu and published them in the 1895 Albanesische Texte mit Glossar (Albanian Texts with Glossary). Other Indo- European scholars who collected Albanian folklore material were German linguists Gustav Weigand and August Leskien. In the first half of the 20th century, British anthropologist Edith Durham visited northern Albania and collected folklore material on the Albanian tribal society. She published in 1909 her notable work High Albania, regarded as one of the best English- language books on Albania ever written. From 1923 onward, Scottish scholar and anthropologist Margaret Hasluck collected Albanian folklore material when she lived in Albania. She published sixteen Albanian folk-stories translated in English in her 1931 K√´ndime Englisht‚ÄìShqip or Albanian‚ÄìEnglish Reader.  Origin  The elements of Albanian mythology are of Paleo-Balkanic origin and almost all of them are pagan. Ancient Illyrian religion is considered to be one of the sources from which Albanian legend and folklore evolved, reflecting a number of parallels with Ancient Greek and Roman mythologies. Albanian legend shows also similarities with neighbouring Indo-European traditions, such as the oral epics with the South Slavs and the folk tales with the Greeks. Albanian mythology inherited the Indo-European narrative epic genre about past warriors, a tradition shared with early Greece, classical India, early medieval England, medieval Germany and South Slavs. Albanian folk beliefs also retained the typical Indo-European tradition of the deities located on the highest and most inaccessible mountains (Mount Tomor), the sky, lightning, weather and fire deities (Zojz, Per√´ndi, Shurdh, Verbt, En, Vat√´r, N√´na e Vatr√´s), the \\"Daughter of the Sun and Moon\\" legend (Bija e Han√´s e Diellit), the \\"serpent-slaying\\" and \\"fire in water\\" myths (Drangue and Kulshedra), the Fates and Destiny goddesses (Zana, Ora, Fat√≠, Mira) and the guard of the gates of the Underworld (the three-headed dog who never sleeps). History Albanian folklore traces back to Paleo-Balkan mythology including a substrate of Illyrian religion. A number of parallels are found with Ancient Greek and Roman mythologies. Albanians were Christianized under Roman Catholic influence likely in the fourth and fifth centuries. In later times, after the Gheg‚ÄìTosk split, they became Catholic in the north and Orthodox in the South. In a text compiled around the beginning of the 11th century in the Bulgarian language, the Albanians are mentioned with their old ethnonym Arbanasi as half-believers. Islam was first introduced to Albania in the 15th century after the Ottoman conquest of the area. In Ottoman times, often to escape higher taxes levied on Christian subjects, the majority of Albanians became Muslims. However one part retained Christian and pre-Christian beliefs. British poet Lord Byron (1788‚Äì1824) described Albanian religious belief as follows: \\"The Greeks hardly regard them as Christians, or the Turks as Muslims; and in fact they are a mixture of both, and sometimes neither.\\" Between the 16th and 18th centuries, in Albania arrived also the Bektashi Sufi order which spread widely among Albanians in part because it allowed itself to be a vehicle for the expression of Crypto-Christian and pagan beliefs and rituals. Bektashism is a Muslim pantheistic dervish order (tariqat) thought to have originated in the 13th century in a frontier region of Anatolia, where Christianity, Islam and paganism coexisted, allowing the incorporation of comparable pagan and non-Muslim beliefs into popular Islam. It facilitated the conversion process to the new Muslims and became the official order of the Janissaries. After the ban of all the Sufi orders in Turkey in 1925, the Bektashi Order established its headquarters in Tirana. Since its founding in 1912, Albania has been a secular state, becoming atheist during the Communist regime, and returning secular after the fall of the regime. Albanian folklore evolved over the centuries in a relative isolated tribal culture and society, and although there have been all these changes in the Albanian belief system, an ancient substratum of pre-Christian beliefs has survived until today.

Another characteristic of Albanian heroic songs are weapons. Their importance and the love which the heroes have for them are carefully represented in the songs, while they are rarely described physically. A common feature appearing in these songs is the desire for fame and glory, which is related to the courage of a person.

Early life She was born in Woolwich to a doctor father and Quaker mother. She had a facility for foreign languages, and this earned her an important post in the Military Censor's office during the Second World War. Post WWII Lister was a long-serving member of the London County Council, representing Woolwich West, and its successor body, the Greater London Council - from 1949-83, and as Deputy Chairman in 1963-64. She was a passionate Europhile believer in Britain's place at the centre of Europe. She served as a member of the executive of the European Union of Women from 1971, and was a member of the European Movement and the Conservative Group for Europe. The purpose of the committee was to encourage Tory women to join non-party organisations with charitable purposes and to express the party's view on all matters connected with social welfare. It was the brainchild of Joan Varley, then a senior functionary at Conservative Central Office, who had noted that Labour activists - and Labour views - seemed over-influential in non-political organisations. Lister helped in the drafting of the Tory response to Barbara Castle's Equal Opportunities Bill and the preparation of the party's argument for entry into the European Economic Community. In 1940 she married an old school friend, Sam Lister (d. 1995), a mechanical engineer who ran a small family firm of manufacturers. Her husband had a keenly developed interest in local government, and became a Woolwich councillor. When it was suggested that he stand for the London County Council, he demurred, and proposed his wife instead. She was duly elected in 1949 and served as an exceptionally effective deputy chairman between 1963-64. She had risen through the voluntary ranks of her party and, in 1971, was chairman of the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations, and thus had the duty of taking the chair at the party conference that year. The job of conference chairman in 1971 was a peculiarly difficult one - the party was riven by doubts about the wisdom of the leadership's policy for entry into the European Economic Community, doubts fueled by the rhetoric of Enoch Powell. Lister presided over the fervent and turbulent debate on European policy - there were 125 amendments to the substantive motion - with the strict sense of control which marked all her public appearances - the Government's policy was carried by a strong majority. Private life In 1940, she married Sam Lister, an old school friend and mechanical engineer who ran a small family manufacturing company.

Examples are the satiric mode, the ironic, the comic, the pastoral, and the didactic. History In his Poetics, the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle uses 'mode' in a more specific sense. Kinds of poetry, he writes, may be differentiated in three ways: according to their medium of imitation, according to their objects of imitation, and according to their mode or 'manner' of imitation (section I). \\"For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration‚Äîin which case he can either take another personality as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged‚Äîor he may present all his characters as living and moving before us\\" (section III). According to this definition, 'narrative' and 'dramatic' are modes of fiction: :\\"This is not merely a technical distinction but constitutes, rather, one of the cardinal principles of a poetics of the drama as opposed to one of narrative fiction. The distinction is, indeed, implicit in Aristotle's differentiation of representational modes, namely diegesis (narrative description) versus mimesis (direct imitation). It has, as we shall see, important consequences for both the logic and the language of the drama.\\" Fiction-writing Fiction is a form of narrative, one of the four rhetorical modes of discourse. Fiction-writing also has distinct forms of expression, or modes, each with its own purposes and conventions. Agent and author Evan Marshall identifies five fiction-writing modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background. Author and writing-instructor Jessica Page Morrell lists six delivery modes for fiction-writing: action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition. Author Peter Selgin refers to methods, including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, and description. =Summarization= Summarization (also referred to as summary, narration, or narrative summary) is the fiction-writing mode whereby story events are condensed. The reader is told what happens, rather than having it shown. In the fiction-writing axiom \\"Show, don't tell\\" the \\"tell\\" is often in the form of summarization. Summarization has important uses: * To connect one part of a story to another * To report events whose details aren't important * To telescope time * To convey an emotional state over an extended period of time * To vary the rhythm and texture of the writing The main advantage of summary is that it takes up less space. According to author Orson Scott Card, either action or summarization could be right, either could be wrong. Factors such as rhythm, pace, and tone come into play. The objective is to get the right balance between telling versus showing, action versus summarization. =Introspection= Introspection (also referred to as internal dialogue, interior monologue, self-talk) is the fiction-writing mode used to convey a character's thoughts. As explained by Renni Browne and Dave King, \\"One of the great gifts of literature is that it allows for the expression of unexpressed thoughts ...\\" According to Nancy Kress, a character's thoughts can greatly enhance a story: deepening characterization, increasing tension, and widening the scope of a story. As outlined by Jack M. Bickham, thought plays a critical role in both scene and sequel. Essay-writing According to Frederick Crews, it is traditional and useful to think of essays as falling into four types, corresponding to four basic functions of prose: description, or picturing; narration, or telling; exposition, or explaining; and argument, or convincing. Susan Anker distinguishes between nine different modes of essay writing: narration, or writing that tells stories; illustration, or writing that gives examples; description, or writing that creates pictures in words; process analysis, or writing that explains how things happen; classification, or writing that sorts things into groups; definition, or writing that tells what something means; comparison and contrast, or writing that shows similarities and differences; cause and effect, or writing that explains reasons or results; and argument, or writing that persuades.

There is also a smaller section, the Series Apocryphorum (CCSA), devoted to Apocryphal works, and a collection of autographs, the Autographa Medii √Üvi (CCAMA). In the series Conciliorum Oecumenicorum Generaliumque Decreta (COGD) is published confessional documents from Churches and Ecumenical organisations in the World with start in Nic√¶a 325 until today. The principal series are seen in some ways as successors to Migne's Patrologiae. In 1947 Dom Eligius Dekkers, O.S.B. of the Sint- Pietersabdij in Steenbrugge, drew up a plan for editing afresh early Christian texts. His intention was to produce in a short timespan a \\"Corpus Christianorum\\", comprising new editions of the writings of Christian authors from Tertullian through to the Venerable Bede. Although some critics thought the project to be impracticable, Dom Eligius found support from the outset in Brepols Publishers from Turnhout. Collaboration started in 1951 with the publication of a highly valued and essential tool, the Clavis Patrum Latinorum, which paved the way for the future success of the series, and later the Clavis Patrum Graecorum. New editions followed from 1953 on and ever since Corpus Christianorum has continued to flourish. New series within Corpus Christianorum have been established and new volumes were ever more regularly published. Although in the early years the modus laborandi relied on updating existing editions, this was soon replaced by the preparation of entirely new critical editions. This demanding ambition required increasing supervision and, together with the establishment of new Corpus-related initiatives, it has been necessary to establish new academic partnerships, comprising leading scholars and academic centres, to supervise every single Corpus series.

Another part of the treasure. The Treasure of Nagyszentmikl√≥s (; ) is an important hoard of 23 early medieval gold vessels, in total weighing 9.945 kg (about 22 lbs), found in 1799 near Nagyszentmikl√≥sFranz Heinrich Ungewitter, Europe, past and present: a comprehensive manual of European geography and history (1850), page 528, Kingdom of Hungary (, today S√¢nnicolau Mare, Romania), meaning \\"Great St Nicholas\\"Official description at Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna . After the excavation, the treasure was transferred to Vienna, the dynastic capital of the Habsburg Monarchy. Ever since, it has been in the possession of the Kunsthistorisches Museum there, where it is on permanent display. A wide range of views continue to be held as to the dating and the origins of the styles of the pieces, and the context in which they were made, which may well vary between the pieces. Unusually, the inscriptions on some pieces have increased the complexity of the arguments rather than reduced them. In 2008 Romanian officials asked the Austrian government for the treasure's repatriation.Banatenii spera sa recupereze Tezaurul de la Sannicolau. Retrieved September 02, 2008.Comorile Banatului se intorc acasa. Retrieved September 02, 2008 In the 19th century the treasure was widely regarded in Hungary as originating with precursors of the Hungarian people, and played a notable part as an icon of Hungarian nationalism. In particular the gold cup with a bull's head facing back over the bowl was known as the \\"Cup of Attila\\" - Attila the Hun having died in 453. Rather illogically, the treasure was also associated with the Magyar Conquest in 896/7.Sinko Katalin, \\"The Creation of a National Style of Ornamentation at the End of the Nineteenth Century\\" pp. 46-48, in Hungarian Ceramics from the Zsolnay Manufactory, 1853-2001, ed. √Åcs, Piroska et al, 2002, Yale University Press, , 9780300097047, google books Description The treasure, consisting of 23 gold vessels and variously dated from the 6th to the 10th century, was found on 3 July 1799 by Neru Vuin, two Bulgarian farmers, in the vicinity of Nagyszentmikl√≥s (S√¢nnicolau Mare).Gyula L√°szl√≥, Istv√°n R√°cz: The Treasure of Nagyszentmikl√≥s, Corvina, 1984, pp. 19 The figure of the \\"victorious Prince\\" dragging a prisoner along by his hair (see figure on the right) and the mythological scene at the back of the golden jar, as well as the design of other ornamental objects, show close affinities with finds at Novi Pazar, Bulgaria and at Sarkel, Russia.

While there is no consensus as to the meaning of the inscription, several translations have been suggested (see the article on the inscription) and there is general agreement that Buyla and Butaul are Turkic names or titles, and that they are associated with the title of ≈æupan. \\"Number 8 Bow inscription\\" from the Treasure of Nagy Szent Miklos; runiform script There is another inscription in the Greek language. Also, there are several other very short inscriptions in a runiform script which are also likely to be in a Turkic language, but these are very brief and also have not been deciphered.Andr√°s R√≥na-Tas, Hungarians and Europe in the early Middle Ages (Central European University Press, 1999; ), pp. 131-132Agust√≠ Alemany, \\"From Central Asia to Balkans: the title *ƒçu(b)-pƒÅn\\" in Christine Allison, Anke Joisten-Pruschke, Antje Wendtland (eds.), DaƒìnƒÅ to D√Æn: Religion, Kultur und Sprache in der iranischen Welt (2009; ), pp. 3-The inscription is executed with Greek capital letters along the periphery of a richly decorated with an open-work interlaced design golden disk, complementarily mounted on the bottom of a shallow semispherical golden cup in the shape of an oval basin with a diameter of 12, p. 5 Cultural context The cultural milieu or milieux in which the objects in the treasure were created, assembled and deposited remains controversial, with the debate often influenced by nationalistic concerns.

Some claim to be similar to one in the √Ålmos legend from the Hungarian mythology: Emese's dream of the Turul bird.

General editor: T. Kov√°cs. Budapest 2002, 57-80. The newest research shows it is closely related to the Avar culture. =Romanian= According to interpretation of Romanian researcher Paul LazƒÉr Tonciulescu, this inscription was written by local people (Romanians/Vlachs and Bulgars according to the quite unreliable Gesta Hungarorum by the Anonymus chronicler), and objects were the property of a local ruler. He further claims the last owner of treasure was Ahtum, who according to Anonymous was the duke of modern Banat with his capital at Morisena, very close to S√¢nnicolau Mare. When Ahtum lost his last battle against Magyars, his family buried the treasure. Tonciulescu translated the text: \\"Jupan Buila [has] all rights, jupan Butaul [has the right of] entering [in] all towns\\". \\"Jupan\\" is also used in the Romanian languagePaul LazƒÉr Tonciulescu, De la »öara Luanei la Ieud, Editura Miracol, Bucure»ôti, 1998 =Slavic= According to interpretation of the inscription on one of the vessels, this inscription was written by a people whose local leaders had Turkic names and bore Slavic titles (such as the title of ≈æupan).Hungarians and Europe in the early Middle Ages: an introduction to early Hungarian history, Andr√°s R√≥na-Tas, Central European University Press, 1999, page 132.Popoli delle steppe: unni, avari, ungari, 23-29 aprile 1987, –¢–æ–º 2, Presso la sede del centro, 1988, page 503. =Hungarian or Bulgar= As noted above, close affinities have been recognized between the S√¢nnicolau Mare material and that found at Novi Pazar and in Khazaria. Archaeologists in both Hungary and Bulgaria consider these affinities to support theories of ancient migration between regions. Both were allied with Khazars for a period. The treasure gives some idea of the art of the First Bulgarian Empire, Hungarian and Khazar states. According to Professor Nykola Mavrodinov (based on Vilhelm Thomsen), the script on vessel number 21 is in Bulgar, written in Greek letters, surrounding a cross, and reads, \\"Boyla Zoapan made this vessel. Butaul Zoapan intended it for drinking.\\"L√°szl√≥ Gy., R√°cz I. (1986): A Nagyszentmikl√≥si kincs (Treasure of Nagyszentmiklos). Helikon, Budapest =Khazar= One school of Hungarian archaeologists maintains that the tenth century gold- and silversmiths working in Hungary were Khazar.Dunlop, D. M., \\"Khazars\\", in Enc. Judaica, 1971-2 printing. When the Magyars migrated to Pannonia in 896, some Khazar tribes, known as the Khavars, came with them to their new homes. The Khavars were skilled gold and silversmiths. =Persian= Khazar art is believed to be modelled on Persian-Sassanide art patterns. The Soviet archaeologist O. H. Bader emphasized the role of the Khazars in the spread of Persian-style silverware towards the north.Bader, O. H., Studies of the Kama Archaeological Expedition (in Russian, Kharkov, 1953) Some of these works may have been re-exported by the Khazars, as middlemen; others were imitations made in Khazar workshops, ruins of which have been found near the ancient Khazar fortress of Sarkel. The Swedish archaeologist T. J. Arne mentions ornamental plates, clasps and buckles of Sassanide and Byzantine inspiration, manufactured in Khazaria or territories under their influence, being found as far afield as Sweden.Arne, T. J., \\"La Su de et l'Orient\\", Archives d'√âtudes Orientales, 8¬∫. v.8, Upsala, 1914. Thus, the Khazars, Magyars and Bulgars could have been intermediaries in spreading Persian-Sassanide art in Eastern Europe.B√°lint Cs. (2004): A nagyszentmikl√≥si kincs. (Treasure of Nagyszentmiklos). Varia Archaeologica Hungarica c. series, XVIa, Budapest =Central Asian= Several elements of the Treasure of S√¢nnicolau Mare have Central Asian counterparts. One is the scene of the divine Garuda bird lifting up a human body. This motif can be found all over Central Asia, India and Siberia. The motif of an animal drinking from the cup also occurs throughout Eurasia from China, through Siberia, to Hungary. The image of the nautilus shell in the set may relate to India, where the animal is native to the Indian Ocean. This relation goes back to the Hephthalites, the white Huns who ruled during the 4th and 5th centuries in Gujarat, Rajasthan.B√°lint Cs. (2000): \\"Der Schatz von Nagyszentmikl√≥s in der Bulgarischen Arch√§ologischen Forschung\\", in Acta Archaeologica Academiae Hungaricae, 51. 1999/2000. 1-4. 429-438 However, this scene might also be about the Persian story of Zal and legendary bird of Simorgh. Zal was the father of the greatest Persian/Iranian hero Rostam and the child of a famous hero called Sam Nariman. He was rejected by his father because he was albino and the Simorgh saved him and raised him.

History  The Summer Pops was established in 1993 by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society under the Artistic Direction of conductor Carl Davis. The event was created to give the RLPO somewhere to play in the summers of 1993 - 1995 while the Philharmonic Hall was being refurbished. The event proved popular and was continued, with artists other than the RLPO performing, but by 2001 the costs of running the event had become too much for the RLPS, so Liverpool City Council asked promoter CMP Entertainment to run the event.http://liverpoolsubculture.blogspot.com/2007/02/revealed-secret-email- from-millionaire.html  Venue  The original venue for the Summer Pops was a green and yellow Big Top tent situated on King's Dock in Liverpool. In 2005, the tent was moved to nearby Trafalgar Dock to make way for the construction of an Arena, ACC Liverpool on the King's Dock site. In 2007, the event moved to the pavilion at Aintree racecourse, and in 2008 the Pops moved to the Arena built on its former home on Kings Dock.

The Chronology mainly addresses the conflict between the United States and North Korea, while including the influences of the other members of the six-party talks: China, Russia, South Korea, and Japan. The North Korean nuclear program can roughly be divided into four phases. Phase I (1956‚Äì80) dealt primarily with training and gaining basic knowledge. Phase II (1980‚Äì94) covers the growth and eventual suspension of North Korea's domestic plutonium production program. Phase III (1994‚Äì2002) covers the period of the \\"freeze\\" on North Korea's plutonium program (though North Korea pursued uranium enrichment in secret)David E. Sanger, North Korea Says It Has a Program on Nuclear Arms , New York Times (October 17, 2002), and Phase IV (2002‚Äìpresent) covers the current period of renewed nuclear activities.  Nuclear weapons types  Nuclear weapon warhead designs fall into various categories. :* Fission devices (commonly called \\"atom bombs\\" or \\"A-bombs\\") rely on nuclear fission, the splitting of extremely heavy elements to release energy. The bombs used against Japan in World War 2 were of this type. :* At the other end of the scale, staged thermonuclear weapons (commonly called \\"hydrogen bombs\\" or \\"H-bombs\\") use one or more fission devices just as a first stage, to ignite a fusion warhead, in which extremely light elements fuse together releasing a great deal of energy. The most massive bombs exploded are of this kind, and can be up to thousands of times more powerful than those used during World War 2. (All multi-megaton modern thermonuclear weapons are of this type) :* Finally between the two are a variety of hybrids, such as \\"boosted\\" designs where a fission device is surrounded by (or contains) fusible material to boost its yield, and \\"fission- fusion-fission\\" devices. These can add anything from a moderate to a significant increase to a fission device. Compared to fission weapons, thermonuclear designs are exceedingly complex, and staged weapons in particular are so complex that only five countries (USA, Russia, France, UK, China) have created them in more than 70 years of research. The fuels for an H-bomb are also far more difficult to create. Several countries with long- standing nuclear weapons programs, such as India and Pakistan, are suspected of striving towards a hybrid or \\"boosted\\" design instead, which is easier. Since both fusion weapons and hybrid designs can at times be referred to as \\"hydrogen bombs\\", it cannot be said with certainty at present, what type of weapon North Korea may have been referring to in any given test. At present, analysts are skeptical of the 2016 test being a staged thermonuclear design, while noting that the most recent test, in 2017, was considerably more powerful. In 2018, North Korea had offered and was reportedly preparing for inspections at nuclear and missile sites. Phase I * 1956: The Soviet Union begins training North Korean scientists and engineers, giving them \\"basic knowledge\\" to initiate a nuclear program. * 1958: The U.S. deploys nuclear armed Honest John missiles and 280 mm atomic cannons to South Korea. * 1959: North Korea and the USSR sign a nuclear cooperation agreement. * 1962: The Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center opens. * 1965: The Yongbyon IRT-2000 research reactor reaches a power rating of 2 MW. * 1974: The Yongbyon IRT-2000 research reactor reaches a power rating of 4 MW. * Between the late 1970s and early 1980s North Korea begins uranium mining operations at various locations near Sunchon and Pyongsan. Phase II * 1980‚Äì1985: North Korea builds a factory at Yongbyon to refine yellowcake and produce fuel for reactors. * 1984: The DPRK completes construction of a \\"Radiochemical laboratory\\", which is actually a reprocessing plant used to separate plutonium from spent nuclear fuel at the Yongbyon site. * 1984‚Äì1986: North Korea completes construction on a 5 MWe gas-cooled, graphite-moderated nuclear reactor for plutonium production. North Korea also commences with the construction of a second 50 MWe nuclear reactor. * 1987: The Yongbyon IRT-2000 research reactor reaches a power rating of 8 MW. * 1989: Soviet control of communist governments throughout Europe begins to weaken, and the Cold War comes to a close. Post-Soviet states emerge in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. As the USSR's power declines, North Korea loses the security guarantees and economic support that had sustained it for 45 years. * Through satellite photos, the U.S. learns of new construction at a nuclear complex near the North Korean town of Yongbyon. U.S. intelligence analysts suspect that North Korea, which had signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1985 but had not yet allowed inspections of its nuclear facilities, is in the early stages of building a nuclear bomb. * In response, the U.S. pursues a strategy in which North Korea's full compliance with the NPT would lead to progress on other diplomatic issues, such as the normalization of relations. * December 1990: North Korea conducts 70‚Äì80 high-explosives tests at its Yongbyon facility. * 1991: The U.S. withdrew its last nuclear weapons from South Korea in December 1991, though U.S. affirmation of this action was not clear, resulting in rumors persisting that nuclear weapons remained in South Korea. The U.S. had deployed nuclear weapons in South Korea since January 1958, peaking in number at about 950 warheads in 1967. * 1992: In May, for the first time, North Korea allows a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The Agency inspection finds inconsistencies with North Korea declarations. Hans Blix, head of the IAEA, and the U.S. suspect that North Korea is secretly using its five-megawatt reactor and reprocessing facility at Yongbyon to turn spent fuel into weapons-grade plutonium. Before leaving, Blix arranges for fully equipped inspection teams to follow. * The inspections do not go well. Over the next several months, the North Koreans repeatedly block inspectors from visiting two of Yongbyon's suspected nuclear waste sites, and IAEA inspectors find evidence that the country is not revealing the full extent of its plutonium production. * 1993: In March, North Korea threatens to withdraw from the NPT. Facing heavy domestic pressure from Republicans who oppose negotiations with North Korea, President Bill Clinton appoints Robert Gallucci to start a new round of negotiations. After 89 days, North Korea announces it has suspended its withdrawal. (The NPT requires three months notice before a country can withdraw.) * In December, IAEA Director-General Blix announces that the agency can no longer provide \\"any meaningful assurances\\" that North Korea is not producing nuclear weapons. * 12 October 1994: the United States and North Korea signed the \\"Agreed Framework\\": North Korea agreed to freeze its plutonium production program in exchange for fuel oil, economic cooperation, and the construction of two modern light-water nuclear power plants. Eventually, North Korea's existing nuclear facilities were to be dismantled, and the spent reactor fuel taken out of the country. * 26 October 1994: IAEA Chairman Hans Blix tells the British House of Commons' Foreign Affairs Select Committee the IAEA is \\"not very happy\\" with the Agreed Framework because it gives North Korea too much time to begin complying with the inspections regime. Phase III * 18 March 1996: Hans Blix tells the IAEA's Board of Governors North Korea has still not made its initial declaration of the amount of plutonium they possess, as required under the Agreed Framework, and warned that without the declaration IAEA would lose the ability to verify North Korea was not using its plutonium to develop weapons. * October 1997: spent nuclear fuel rods were encased in steel containers, under IAEA inspection. * 31 August 1998: North Korea launched a Paektusan-1 space launch vehicle in a launch attempt of its Kwangmy≈èngs≈èng-1 satellite. U.S. military analysts suspect satellite launch is a ruse for the testing of an ICBM. This missile flew over Japan causing the Japanese government to retract 1 billion in aid for two civilian light-water reactors. =2002= * Early in the year construction of uranium enrichment facility at the Kangson enrichment site started. * 29 January: U.S. President George W. Bush in his State of the Union Address named North Korea as part of the axis of evil, aiming to threaten the peace of the world and posing a grave danger. * 7 August: \\"First Concrete\\" pouring at the construction site of the light-water nuclear power plants being built by the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization under the 1994 Agreed Framework. Construction of both reactors was many years behind the agreement's target completion date of 2003. * 17 September: Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi becomes the first Japanese prime minister to visit Pyongyang, making a number of political and cooperative offers. * 3‚Äì5 October: On a visit to the North Korean capital Pyongyang, US Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly presses the North on suspicions that it is continuing to pursue a nuclear energy and missiles programme. Mr Kelly says he has evidence of a secret uranium-enriching program carried out in defiance of the 1994 Agreed Framework. Under this deal, North Korea agreed to forsake nuclear ambitions in return for the construction of two safer light water nuclear power reactors and oil shipments from the US. * 16 October: The US announces that North Korea admitted in their talks to a \\"clandestine nuclear-weapons\\" program. * 17 October: Initially the North appears conciliatory. Leader Kim Jong-il says he will allow international weapons inspectors to check that nuclear facilities are out of use. * 20 October: North-South Korea talks in Pyongyang are undermined by the North's nuclear program \\"admission\\". US Secretary of State Colin Powell says further US aid to North Korea is now in doubt. The North adopts a mercurial stance, at one moment defiantly defending its \\"right\\" to weapons development and at the next offering to halt nuclear program in return for aid and the signing of a non-aggression pact with the US. It argues that the US has not kept to its side of the Agreed Framework, as the construction of the light water reactors‚Äîdue to be completed in 2003‚Äîis now years behind schedule. * 14 November: US President George W Bush declares November oil shipments to the North will be the last if the North does not agree to put a halt to its weapons ambitions. * 18 November: Confusion clouds a statement by North Korea in which it initially appears to acknowledge having nuclear weapons. A key Korean phrase understood to mean the North does have nuclear weapons could have been mistaken for the phrase \\"entitled to have\\", Seoul says. * 27 November: The North accuses the US of deliberately misinterpreting its contested statement, twisting an assertion of its \\"right\\" to possess weapons into an \\"admission\\" of possession. * December: South Korean presidential election. The Grand National Party, who opposed the Sunshine Policy which was conceived in 1998, made much of the North Korean situation, although it eventually lost the election. * 4 December: The North rejects a call to open its nuclear facilities to inspection. * 11 December: North Korean-made Scud missiles are found aboard a ship bound for Yemen.

The country's official Korean Central News Agency said the test was performed successfully, and there was no radioactive leakage from the site. South Korea's Yonhap news agency said the test was conducted at 10:36 a.m. (01:36 GMT) in Hwaderi near Kilju city, citing defense officials. The USGS detected an earthquake with a preliminary estimated magnitude of 4.2 at 41.311¬∞N, 129.114¬∞E . The USGS coordinate indicates that the location in much north of Hwaderi, near the upper stream of Oran-chon, 17 km NNW of Punggye-Yok, according to analysts reports. In an interview on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, former Secretary of State James Baker let it slip that North Korea ‚Äú... had a rudimentary nuclear weapon way back in the days when I was Secretary of State, but now this is a more advanced one evidently.‚Äù He was Secretary of State between 1989 and 1992. * 10 October: Some western scientists had doubts as to whether the nuclear weapon test that took place on 9 October 2006 was in fact successful. The scientists cite that the measurements recorded only showed an explosion equivalent to 500 metric tons of TNT, as compared to the 1998 nuclear tests that India and Pakistan conducted which were 24‚Äì50 times more powerful. This could indicate that the test resulted in a fizzle. Some also speculated that the test may be a ruse using conventional explosives and nuclear material. * 14 October: The United Nations Security Council passed U.N. Resolution 1718, imposing sanctions on North Korea for its announced nuclear test on 9 October 2006 that include largely symbolic steps to hit the North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, a reiteration of financial sanctions that were already in place, as well as keeping luxury goods away from its leaders, for example French wines and spirits or jet skis.

U.S. officials are no longer making this a major issue in the six-party talks. * 13 February: The fifth round of the six-party talks conclude with an agreement. Pyongyang promises to shut down the Yongbyon reactor in exchange for 50,000 metric tons of fuel aid, with more to follow upon verification that the site has been permanently disabled.

Supreme leader Kim Jong-un promised that the country will eventually have nuclear-armed, intercontinental ballistic missiles that can reach the continental United States, thus challenging the Trump Administration of the United States to review its policy options, including preemptive strikes or further isolation of the North Korean economy. * 15 April: at the yearly major public holiday Day of the Sun, North Korea staged a massive military parade to commemorate the 105th birth anniversary of Kim Il-sung, the country's founder and grandfather of current leader, Kim Jong-un. The parade took place amid hot speculation in the United States, Japan, and South Korea that the country would look to also potentially test a sixth nuclear device, which it did not do. * 3 September: At 3:31 AM UTC, the United States Geological Survey reported that it had detected a magnitude 6.3 earthquake in North Korea near the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site. Given the shallow depth of the quake and its proximity to North Korea's primary nuclear weapons testing facility, experts concluded that the country had conducted a sixth nuclear weapon test (2017 North Korean nuclear test). North Korea claimed that they had tested a hydrogen bomb capable of being mounted on an ICBM. The independent seismic monitoring agency NORSAR initially estimated that the blast had a yield of around 120 kilotons but subsequently revised to based on a tremor of 6.1M =2018= * 20 April: Kim Jong Un announces he would immediately suspend nuclear and missile testing and shut down the Punggye-ri site that was used for six earlier nuclear tests. *31 October: South Korea's National Intelligence Service conducts first ever inspection of North Korea's nuclear program and recommends international experts accept North Korea's invitation for an international inspection. =2019= * 1 December: North Korea announced it had recently conducted a \\"very important test\\" at its Sohae site.

Geography The town is situated on the northeast end of the island and was incorporated in 1950. Bell Island's soil contains red hematite or iron ore and this resource was the main reason for Wabana's development. Economy Wabana came to prominence during the 1890s when the Butler family from Port de Grave staked mining claims on the north side of the island. These were sold to the Nova Scotia Steel Company and later sold to the Dominion Steel Corporation in the early 1900s. The first mine opened in 1896 and the site of the mines was named Wabana by Thomas Cantly, an official with Nova Scotia Steel Co. - the name being Abenaki for \\"place where the light shines first.\\" Post office in Wabana The mines saw Wabana's population swell to 14,000 within a few years, the second largest community in the Dominion of Newfoundland. 101 workers lost their lives over the course of Bell Island's iron ore industry. A further 65 sailors on merchant ships were lost on two separate attacks by German U-boats in the fall of 1942 which saw 4 cargo ships for carrying iron ore to the steel mill at Sydney, Nova Scotia sunk. Wabana's population declined following World War II as the underground mines began to face shortfalls in production, being forced to compete with more efficient open pit mines in Labrador and Minnesota. The parent company, Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation (DOSCO), had been in operation since 1930 and was taken over by other conglomerates in the late 1950s. The steel mill and coal mines in Nova Scotia were facing uncertain futures and their shut down was announced in 1965 (although they were subsequently nationalized). The expected announcement of the shut down of the iron ore mines in Wabana came on April 19, 1966. Following their closure, the mines were left to flood and the population of Wabana has since steadily declined. Today, the working population mostly commutes to St. John's on a daily basis, while in the summer a tour of one of the decommissioned mines draws tourism to the island. The island is served by the provincial government ferry system, via the and . Demographics The population of Wabana peaked at 8,026 in 1961. Since the closure of the mines in 1966, the population has steadily declined, with the 2016 Census reporting a population of 2,146 in the community.

Partnering with Cage to form Nighthawks, the two crafted an album during a single three- day creative session. He was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2006, and died after a two year fight at the age of thirty. Life and career Born Tero Smith, on June 26, 1977, in Columbus, Ohio, United States, Camu Tao made his name as a hip hop producer, rapper, and singer. Smith died on May 25, 2008, two years after being diagnosed with lung cancer. At the time of his death, he was producing a song for Cage's I Never Knew You EP and working on his first solo for Definitive Jux. On July 9, 2009, El-P announced via Twitter that the album, King of Hearts, was finished, and would be released on October 20, 2009.https://twitter.com/therealelp King of Hearts was released on August 17, 2010 by Definitive Jux in collaboration with Fat Possum Records along with a free download EP from Central Services. About the album, El-P said: > We all expected to get Camu in the studio and go as far as he wanted to go > with the record. The songs are bare, but then again a lot of them are just > what he wanted. A lot of them wouldn‚Äôt have changed much. Knowing Camu, he > had a lot of talented musician friends he would have liked to have > collaborated and have involved. I do think the album would have been > different had he lived to complete it. Aesop Rock, also on Definitive Jux, stated in a 2008 interview with The A.V. Club that his next album may contain \\"a couple of songs about my friend Camu [Tao]\\". In his song, \\"Racing Stripes,\\" Aesop Rock reflects on Camu Tao near the end of his life. Specifically, Aesop Rock notes Camu Tao's unusual haircut, and the unusual new habits Camu Tao had developed. Camu Tao is also the main subject in Aesop Rock's song \\"Get Out of the Car\\" in his 2016 album The Impossible Kid, reflecting on how the death of his friend drove him to an 8 year long state of emotional paralysis and an increasing trend of self- imposed social isolation. In 2017 when the video for this song was released he remarked: \\"This May 25th marks 9 years since the death of my friend Camu Tao, an event that serves as an emotional and narrative anchor in both this song and my life. I wanted to reflect on things that had changed since, and try to connect some events I hadn't realized were potentially related\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwoyo0Rt4Bw El-P, founder of the defunct Definitive Jux label, dedicated his album Cancer 4 Cure to his memory. Years later, he indirectly speaks about him in his verse in the track \\"Thursday in the Danger Room\\" in Run the Jewels 3 by Run the Jewels. El-P has confirmed that the verse was about his experience with Camu while he had cancer in a response to a tweet from a fan on his official Twitter account. It is evident by the lyrics that this experience was extremely emotionally taxing for him.

He is the current founder, chairman and general coach of Shanghai East Asia football club as well as also being the owner of the Genbao Football Academy. While Xu Genbao was a Chinese international footballer, it was not until he became a manager and won the Chinese Jia-A League title with the China B team that he started to gain attention within Chinese football. This early success would lead to a Chinese national team appointment and then successful spells at Shanghai Shenhua and Dalian Wanda. Playing career Predominately a left back throughout his career, Genbao would mainly play for Nanjing Army Football Team and Bayi Football Team. The Chinese Cultural Revolution saw his career severely shortened, however once it ended he was able to resume his career and help win the league title for Bayi Football Team in 1974. He was even able to play for the Chinese football team in their successful qualification for the 1976 AFC Asian Cup. Management career=Early management career= After he retired he was given the opportunity to manage second-tier club Shanxi Provincial Football Team in 1978, where after two seasons he was unable to help the team win promotion. He would take a position with the Huochetou Football Association until third-tier club Yunnan Provincial Football Team offered him a position to manage them in the 1982 league, however he was unable to lead them to promotion and left soon after. =China= When he left Yunnan he returned to his training to become a professional manager, which led to him take advanced courses at Beijing Sports Institute from 1984 to 1986. When he finished he was given the opportunity to manage the newly formed China B team, which was essentially the Chinese youth team who were allowed to play in the league system. His time with them was extremely successful and he was even able to win the league title with them in the 1989 league season. Impressed with his leadership the Chinese Football Association would remove the Chinese youth team from the league and allow Xu Genbao to take the team to play international tournaments. This would then lead to Xu Genbao being offered the Chinese senior team position; however his reign was extremely short when the Football Association decided it wanted a more experienced manager in Klaus Schlappner to lead the team to the 1992 AFC Asian Cup. Nevertheless, Xu Genbao would stay with the Chinese team as an assistant until 1993. =Shanghai Shenhua= With the Chinese Football Association demanding the entire league system to be professional Shanghai Shenhua wanted Xu Genbao to help them in their transition at the beginning of the 1994 league season. He quickly enforced more professional techniques and tactics as well as developing a team able to fight Dalian Wanda's dominance within the league. This would pay off in the 1995 league season when Shanghai Shenhua would convincingly win the league title for the first time in over thirty years. Xu Genbao's personal desire to see better training techniques saw him decide to help found Shanghai Cable 02, a youth football team designed to improve the football techniques of young Chinese players. The following season back at Shanghai Shenhua, however was difficult for Xu Genbao and he was unable to replicate his success he had previously shown despite coming second within the league. Shanghai Shenhua would part ways with Xu Genbao and he would go on to join second-tier club Guangzhou Songri in the 1997 league season where he immediately made an impact by aiding them to a 4th-place finish and promotion to the top tier. =Dalian Wanda= When Dalian Wanda were looking for a replacement for their previously successful manager Chi Shangbin they quickly turned to Xu Genbao despite previously managing for their title rivals. In his first season Xu Genbao seemed like an inspired choice when he quickly imposed himself within the team and won them another league title in his first season as well as coming runners-up in the 1997-98 Asian Club Championship. The following season, however saw Dalian's fortunes drastically change when they struggled in the league and flirted with relegation, which would see Xu Genbao resigning at the end of the season. =Return to Shanghai= He returned to Shanghai with second-tier football team Shanghai Zhongyuan, where he would lead them to the league title and promotion by the 2001 league season. Shanghai Shenhua who hadn't won the title since Xu Genbao left wanted to bring him back hoping for him to replicate the success he previously had, Xu Genbao would decide that this was the perfect opportunity for him to sell and incorporate his now adult and professional football team Shanghai Cable 02 into the Shanghai Shenhua team. While most of the Shanghai Cable 02 players had a season of playing third-tier football, Xu Genbao's desire to immediately merge them into the Shanghai Shenhua would prove to be a disaster during his reign, and his temper did not bring out the best from his players. With Shenhua flirting with relegation, he was essentially sacked from his post as manager, with Wu Jingui taking over. Ironically, the following season Shanghai Shenhua would go on to win the league title using many of the players brought from the Shanghai Cable 02 squad. =Shanghai East Asia= Xu Genbao would move away from management and founded a football school in 2001 called Genbao Football Academy, however after several years outside management he would return when he would go on to found Shanghai East Asia in 2005 where he named himself their head coach until 2009 when he took a step back and allowed Jiang Bingyao to replace him while he remained as their chairmen. After spending several seasons still in the second tier Xu Genbao would become impatient Jiang Bingyao and decided to become the head coach of the team once more at beginning of the 2011 league season.  Club ownership  Xu Genbao established a football club Shanghai East Asia in cooperation with Shanghai Dongya Sports and Culture Center Co. Ltd on the basis of Genbao Football Academy in 2006. The club won promotion to China League One in 2008 and to Chinese Super League in 2013. He sold the club to Shanghai International Port Group for ¬• 200 million in November 2014. He kept the U-15 team and below of the football academy. In March 2018, he sold the U-19 team (born in 1999 and 2000) to his former club Shanghai Greenland Shenhua. Xu acquired Spanish Segunda Divisi√≥n B side La Hoya Lorca in July 2016 and changed their name to Lorca FC.

Distribution Lilium pardalinum subsp. pitkinense is found in the narrow elevation range of above mean sea level. The Pitkin Marsh lily is found only in freshwater marshes and wet meadows in western Sonoma County, Northern California.Jepson Manual, University of California Press (1993) There are only three known colonies of this rare species in the vicinity, including the Pitkin Marsh situated near State Route 116 between Sebastopol and Forestville, California.Sonoma County Audubon Society Online P. Rubtzoff, A phytogeographical analysis of the Pitkin Marsh (Sonoma County). Wasmann Journal of Biology. 11:129-219 (1953). A land development proposal has been proposed which would infringe upon this marsh, which contains a second rare plant species, the white sedge, Carex albida. The historic range is thought to have been throughout a slightly wider portion of the wetlands of Sonoma County,Environmental Impact Report for the proposed Roblar Road Rock Quarry, Earth Metrics Inc. Report 7673, prepared for Sonoma County and the California State Clearinghouse, September, 1989 with much higher densities of organisms, possibly ranging into the Laguna de Santa Rosa. Description Lilium pardalinum subsp. pitkinense attains a height of . The leaves of the Pitkin Marsh lily are typically about 14 centimeters long and one to two centimeters in width. The whorled leaves of the Pitkin Marsh lily are staggered along the stem, and are generally elliptical to oblanceolate in shape.Flora of North America: Profile of the Pitkin Marsh lily Near the Pitkin Marsh, individuals are found which seem to be hybrids with the closely related Panther lily. The plant blooms in the months of June and July. Petals are red at their outer margins, transitioning to yellow at the centers, with small dark maroon dots. The anthers are purplish-brown. This species is distinguished from its more common lookalike, the Leopard lily (Lilium pardalinum), by shorter petals and anthers. Historic habitat for Pitkin Marsh lily in the upper Americano Creek watershed, now heavily damaged by cattle grazing. Conservation The U.S. Federal Government undertook hearings on listing the Pitkin Marsh lily as early as 1996.U.S. Federal Register: Consideration of federal listing of nine plant species In 1997 this species was placed on the United States list of endangered plants,U.S. Federal Register 62 FR 54791 54808 (1997) and the State of California classified the plant as California Endangered in 1978. The habitat of this rare plant has been greatly reduced from historic levels primarily through cattle overgrazing;Sierra Club plant profile for the Pitkin Marsh lily additional losses have been sustained by collectors seeking this plant for its rarity and beauty. Ongoing threats to this species are deemed to be cattle grazing and alteration of wetlands hydrology and water quality. ;Five colonies status There are three known extant colonies of the Pitkin Marsh lily in wetland areas of western Sonoma County.Center for Plant Conservation: Profile for Pitki Marsh lily The owner of the first property has denied researchers access to the colony since 1975. It is presumed that the plants still exist, but there is no confirmation of the number of organisms remaining. The second site is the Pitkin Marsh, which was nearly extirpated by land development in 1960s, but approximately 200 plants remain. A major subdivision is planned in the surrounding area, but a \\"conservation easement\\" agreement between the California Department of Fish and Game and the landowner will mitigate in preserving this population. The recent threat to the Pitkin Marsh colony occurred when a parcel, including part of the marsh, was proposed for development as a 29-bed residential care facility. This zoning application is pending with the County of Sonoma. At the third known site, where this had once been a common species, only two individuals remain. This loss was due to wetland filling, but was primarily caused by the collection of specimens and bulbs for horticultural use. Owners of the latter two sites entered into voluntary protection agreements with The Nature Conservancy in 1989. The fourth site is Ragle Ranch Regional Park in Sabastopol Ca. There are several individuals but they are in decline due to being in a well traveled area of the park. The fifth site is a forest north east of the town of Bodega. Their status is unknown.

The book is by music journalist Tony Scherman with a foreword by Wynton Marsalis. More than half the text is directly quoted from Palmer, making the book as much an autobiography as it is a biography. The story begins with Palmer as a four-year-old vaudeville tap dancer and continues with the story of New Orleans music and the emergence of a strong rock and roll drumming style featuring the back beat. After his triumphs in the city, Palmer moved to Los Angeles, where he became one of the top session musicians and arrangers of the 1950s through the 1970s, playing on hundreds of hits, from \\"La Bamba\\" to Percy Faith and Frank Sinatra. The sections quoting Palmer are colorful, frank, and direct, giving the full flavor of his life as a musician. For example, speaking of playing on Little Richard's records: :\\"Richard's music was exciting as a sumbitch. I'm not talking about the quality of it. It wasn't quality music. It wasn't no chords. It was just blues. \\"Slippin' and Slidin'\\" sounded like \\"Good Golly Miss Molly\\" and they both sounded like \\"Lucille\\". It was exciting because he was exciting. Richard is one of the few people I've ever recorded with that was just as exciting to watch in the studio as he was in performance.\\" The book includes an extensive discography and notes.

It is illustrated by Nick Sharratt, although the only illustrations in this book are the chapter- headings. Some of the characters in Love Lessons are similar to those in one of the author's previous books, Waiting for the Sky to Fall (1983). The title of the novel is identical to David Belbin's earlier Love Lessons (1998) which is about a sexual affair between a pupil and teacher, but Wilson's book is far more soft-centred. Plot summary The story revolves around a girl called Prudence \\"Prue\\" King who lives with her bossy, often scary dad who loses his temper very easily, a sweet yet pressured mother and an immature but kindhearted younger sister, Grace. Her dad is very temperamental and he gets mad on silly things like art classes for Prue and he thinks going to school is an absurd idea. He insists on educating Prue and Grace himself while running a not so successful book shop. One day a man called Mr Miles from the education system comes and tells Prue's father that Prue will have to go to school so she can get her GCSEs. After much grumbling her father reluctantly decides to send her to Maths tuition but not to school. After the class, Prue gives up and skives from her classes, while spending ¬£60.00 in tuition fees on treats including lingerie. When her father finds this out it brings on a stroke. During the time her father is recovering from the stroke, the girls‚Äô mother decides to send them to the nearest public school, Wentworth High, while still keeping it a secret from their sick father. Prue and Grace go to their new school and find it a slightly scary place. Prue meets the school art teacher, Mr Raxberry (\\"Rax\\" as everyone calls him) and develops a crush on him. Prue tries to be confident but Grace shows that she is scared. The girls give admission exams but while Grace finds most questions easy, Prue panics as she thinks the easy questions are trick questions and cannot do the hard ones. She writes an essay in hope that it will be counted as good intelligence. Grace passes with flying colours while Prue does not get a good score and is sent in the class where dumb kids are put. She finds it a struggle and is very unhappy. Grace on the other hand is very happy and makes new friends who nicknamed themselves as Iggy and Figgy; Grace calls herself Piggy. The next day is also difficult for Prue as there are PE lessons and she has to change with the other girls; they see Prue's lacy knickers and bra and start calling her a 'slag', but she has Rax's art lessons to look forward to. She enjoys it immensely and Rax even tells her that 'You‚Äôre going to be the girl that makes my teaching worthwhile'. A boy called Toby likes Prue, although the feeling is not mutual and Toby's girlfriend, Rita Rogers, a pretty but mean girl, is very jealous of them. Prue helps Toby with his reading as he is dyslexic and continues to visit her father, who is being extremely uncooperative in trying to recover his speaking skills, on a regular basis. Meanwhile, Rita finds out that Prue has seen Toby. Thinking Prue's time with him is Prue going after him and being the reason Toby dumped her, Prue and Rita fight, before Ms Wilmott comes over and breaks them up. Prue finds out while talking to Rax that he is married to a blonde woman who had been his childhood sweetheart and has a son and daughter. Soon Prue and Rax's relationship starts to develop and they share the 10 minutes of peace they have without anyone in the way, to talk and laugh, every time in the car journey to Prue's house, as Prue starts to babysit for Rax's children. After having an argument with Rax, Prue confronts him and asks if he loves her, he then confesses that he does and cannot stop fantasising about her but says that he cannot risk his marriage and his job. She then kisses Rax, who at first pulls away but Prue is persistent and kisses him again and soon Rax begins to kiss Prue back. Afraid they will be spotted Rax drives off to a place he used to go to with his wife when they were young, they talk and continue kissing. However, when she arrives back home Prue's dad has come home, he finds out about their going to school but cannot do much because of his still stiff position. Afraid that he will ban her and Grace from going back to school and therefore not seeing Rax any more, she confides her troubles to Rax, who is really agitated about them being seen together and asks her to calm down. Finally he hugs her trying to calm her but then another student named Sarah spots Prue hugging Rax and telling him that she loves him. Sarah then proceeds to tell everyone else about the incident in an English class where Ms Godfrey asks them to name some modern-day versions of Romeo and Juliet; Rita angrily comes out with 'Prue and Toby' before Sarah says, 'No. Prue and Rax'. The end consists of the head teacher of the school expelling Prue. Rax comes and says goodbye to Prue for the last time, and they briefly consider running off together. Later, with the help of Toby, Prue's family discovers a set of valuable antique books and sells them to pay off their heavy debts. Prue is sent to Kingtown High School while Rax gets to keep his job. Characters Prudence 'Prue' Charity King - A fourteen-year-old girl who is homeschooled by her father. She is rather artistic but is not very good at maths. Prudence wants to go to art college but her father does not allow her. However, she spends all her pocket money on sketchbooks, soft pencils and coloured crayons in hope of becoming a professional artist. Her father later sent her to maths classes with Miss Roberts, but after the first lesson, Prue did poorly and hated it there. She gives up and skives from her classes, spending ¬£60.00 in the process on chocolate which she later shares with Grace, magazines, food from McDonald's, art materials and some expensive lingerie. Prue's father finds out and gets so worked up about it that he has a stroke and has to leave for the hospital immediately. After much thinking over, the girls‚Äô mother decides to send them to the nearest public school, Wentworth High, while still keeping it a secret from their father. In her art classes, Prue gets a crush on her art teacher, Rax. She grows closer to him, especially when he invites her to babysit for him, which she accepts. The last time she babysits, she confronts Rax about her love for him, and they kiss. After her father finds out they are going to school, Prue goes to Rax, upset and distraught that her father might stop her going. Sarah walks in and sees Prue hugging Rax and telling him she loves him. Sarah comes out about Prue and Rax's affair during an English lesson about Romeo and Juliet, discussing modern day versions of the couple. Ms Godfrey contacts Ms Wilmot, who sees Sarah and then Prue, whom she expels. After her last session in the Success Maker, Prue is met by Grace, who tells her what she has heard. Prue tells her that she has been expelled. Rax is waiting for her in his car. They drive off, and although Prue begs to go with him, they say goodbye and Rax drives to her house, before she leaves him. Grace Patience King - Prue's eleven-year-old younger sister. Grace is kindhearted, tubby and childish. She adapts well to the school environment and quickly makes friends. As soon as they go into Wentworth, Grace and Prudence start to grow apart and have a row in the middle of the book. They seem to make up at the end of the book. Keith 'Rax' Raxberry - The art teacher who teaches at Wentworth. He is friendly to Prue and Grace as soon as they go into the school and at the end of day he almost ran over Prue with his car but is incredibly kind and casual; not really fussing about it. After seeing Prudence's work during the Tuesday art lesson he says she is going to be the pupil who will make his teaching worthwhile. Mr. Raxberry and Prue become close friends and he invites her to babysit for his children, a four-year-old son Harry and his six-month-old daughter Lily. She does because she wants to start earning money for the family who is currently in debt and cannot afford the school uniform but also because she likes Rax. The relationship between Mr. Raxberry and Prue begins to heavily develop. She is in love with him, even though he has a wife and children, and the two of them kiss in the car after Prudence's last night of babysitting at Rax's house. Toby Baker - A popular boy in Prudence's year and Rita's former boyfriend. Toby is handsome with floppy blonde hair. He has sweet manners and charms Prudence's mother into letting him take Prue out for the day. Toby is said to be worshipped around the school, with several admirers in various other years. It is discovered, around halfway through the book that Toby is in love with Prudence and tries to kiss her when they are smoking behind the bike sheds. He is dyslexic, and gets Prue to help him with his reading. Rita finds out after Aimee sees them sitting talking in McDonald's, and Toby dumps Rita shortly afterwards. Mrs. King - Prue and Grace's mother. Bernard King - Prue and Grace's short tempered father. He has a stroke at the start of the book and spends the majority of the book in hospital. Rita Rogers - Toby's former girlfriend, at the start of the book, but he later dumps her for Prue, although Prue is not interested. She is pretty but mean, with thick outlined eyes and carefully curled dark hair. She often teases and is cruel to Prue, and this is made worse after Toby dumps her, as Rita, angry at Prue, also blames her for it. Marianne Raxberry - Rax's wife and the mother of Harry and Lily. She often gets irritated with Rax. Jean 'Iggy' Igloo' and Fiona 'Figgy' Harrison - Grace's new friends who irritate Prue. Figgy and Iggy have a secret club and let Grace join it, letting her in on an irritating double waved hand shake. Grace gives herself the nickname 'Piggy' when she joins their club. Nurse Ray - A kind and cheerful nurse who helps Bernard King at the hospital. She is described as fat with brown skin and long dark hair in a plait. Harry Raxberry and Lily Raxberry- Rax's four year old son and baby daughter. Prue babysits them. Mrs Wilmot - The head teacher at Wentworth. Mrs. Godfrey - The English teacher at Wentworth who is constantly irritated at Prudence. Gina - Mrs Wilmot's secretary. It is implied that she has a crush on Rax, as she is seen looking at him wistfully. Sarah - A friendly girl with learning difficulties who is in Prudence's form. Her favourite colour is red, and she gets on very well with Rax. Aimee, Megan and Jess - Rita's friends. Daisy - A 'lumpy' girl who is in Prudence's form. Mrs. Peters - The P.E teacher at Wentworth. She is one of the few teachers who is friendly towards Prue. She knows Latin. Eve Lambert - Prue's form teacher. Mr. Evans - Mr Evans is one of the teachers at the Success Maker. He is seen trying to teach two foreign boys English. Controversy The book was met with some criticism for the message it sends to young teens. It was pointed out by older readers that many pupils get crushes on their teachers and the book implies that it would be alright for teens to act on them because the teacher may reciprocate their feelings. In the story Prue is solely blamed and expelled by the head teacher when the affair is discovered and Rax is never brought up as accountable for his abuse of a minor.

The geography and urban development of Dresden is embossed by the valley location and by the Elbe stream. Geography= Location = View over Dresden from the south-eastern slopes Dresden lies on both banks of the river Elbe, mostly in the Dresden Basin, with the further reaches of the eastern Ore Mountains to the south, the steep slope of the Lusatian granitic crust to the north and the Elbe Sandstone Mountains to the east at an elevation of about 113 metres. The northern parts of Dresden are in the West Lusatian Highlands (Westlausiter Berg- und H√ºgelland). The depth influx valleys and the higher areas in the south of Dresden characterise the change to the eastern foothills of the Ore Mountains. The Elbe valley basin is a part of the Saxon Elbe Landscape. The highest point of Dresden is the Triebenberg, at about 384 metres above sea level. With a pleasant location and a mild climate on the Elbe, as well as Mediterranean architecture, Dresden was given the sobriquet \\"Elbflorenz\\" (\\"Florence of the Elbe\\"). The incorporation of neighbouring rural communities over the past 60 years has made Dresden the fourth largest urban area in Germany after Berlin, Hamburg, and Cologne. The most important river in Dresden is the Elbe river, the only navigable body of water to flow through the city. There are also a number of tributaries such as the river Wei√üeritz. = Surroundings = The Dresden conurbation in Saxony The nearest German cities are Chemnitz (80 km to the southwest), Leipzig (100 km to the northwest) and Berlin (200 km to the north). The Czech capital Prague is about 150 km to the south; the Polish city of Wroc≈Çaw is about 200 km to the east. There are some medium-sized towns such as Pirna (40,000 inhabitants), Freital (40,000), Radebeul (33,000 inhabitants) and Mei√üen (28,000 inhabitants) in the borough of Dresden. Riesa and Freiberg are not far away. Greater Dresden, which spreads in the neighbouring districts of Kamenz, Mei√üen, Riesa-Gro√üenhain, S√§chsische Schweiz, Wei√üeritzkreis and in small parts in the district of Bautzen, has a population of around 1,250,000 inhabitants.Regionales Entwicklungskonzept Dresden: Map of Greater Dresden =Nature= 63 % of Dresden is green areas ‚Äì The images includes parts of the inner city and the district of highest density in population as well as the Elbe meadows and the Dresden Heath forest Due to the many rural districts it has incorporated, among other things, Dresden is one of the greenest cities in Europe, with 63% of the city being green areas and forests. The Dresden Heath (Dresdner Heide) in northern Dresden is a cohesive forest of 50 km¬≤ in size. There are four nature reserves in Dresden. The additional Special Areas of Conservation cover an area of 18 km¬≤. The protected gardens, parkways, parks and old graveyards host 110 natural monuments in the city.Dresden: Dresden--a Green city The Dresden Elbe Valley is a world heritage site which is focused on the conservation of the cultural landscape in Dresden. One important part of that landscape is the Elbe meadows which cross the city, 20 kilometres long. =Climate= Winter in Dresden. Most of the city is in the Elbe valley, where the microclimate differs from that on the slopes and in the highlands. Klotzsche, at 227 metres above sea level, is one of the higher districts of the city. Klotzsche hosts Dresden weather station. According to experience, the weather in Klotzsche is 1-3¬∞C colder than the inner city's climate. Especially in summer, there are generally high temperatures at night in the city: Temperatures of 25¬∞C at midnight are no exception. The average temperature in January is ‚àí0.7¬∞C and in July 18.1¬∞C.Deutscher Wetterdienst: Average of the period from 1961 to 1990 Summers are hotter in Dresden and winters are colder than the German average. Dresden lies in a climate zone of cold-moderate climate crossing over to a continental climate. The inner city's average monthly temperatures are almost the same as those in cities in southwest Germany; on average 10.2¬∞C per year. In hot summers, Dresden is between the hot Lusatia and the milder Ore Mountains. Both regions are characterised by strong winters: temperatures of ‚àí20¬∞C are not impossible in Dresden. The driest months are February and March, with precipitation of 40 mm. Spring months have often been arid in the last couple of years (with less than 10 mm of precipitation). The most precipitation falls in July and August, at 60 mm per month. Urban development=Flood protection= Dresden often floods Due to its location on the banks of the Elbe and where some water sources from the Ore Mountains flow to, flood protection is an important aspect of the city's development. Large areas are kept free of buildings to provide a floodplain. Two additional trenches of about 50 metres in width have been built to keep the inner city free of water from the Elbe river by dissipating the water downstream through the inner city's gorge portion. Flood regulation systems like detention basins and water reservoirs are almost all outside the city area. However many locations and areas have to be defended by walls and sheet pilings. A number of districts in Dresden become locked if the Elbe river is flooding some of its old bayous. = City structuring = Dresden is a spacious city, not only due to the most recent incorporations in the 1990s. The districts of the city differ in their structure and appearance. Many parts of city still contain an old village core, while some quarters are almost completely preserved as rural settings. Other characteristic kinds of urban areas are the historic outskirts of the city, the former suburbs with dotted housing. In Socialist times a lot of apartment blocks were built. Not unsurprisingly, the districts in Dresden are a mix of all these kinds of area. The original parts of the city are almost all in the districts of Altstadt (Old town) and Neustadt (New town). Growing outside the city walls, the historic outskirts were built in the 18th century. They were planned and constructed on the instruction of the Saxon monarchs, which is why the outskirts are often named after the sovereigns. From the 19th century the city only grew by incorporating other districts. Dresden was divided into the five city districts Mitte (centre), Ost (east), West, S√ºd (south) and Nord (north) between 1958 and 1991. Nevertheless, these divisions had never been adopted by the local population. Therefore, in 1991 Dresden has been divided into ten boroughs called Ortsamtsbereiche, which host subunits of the Dresden community's political and administrative institutions. In addition nine former municipalities which have been incorporated between 1997 and 1999 form Ortschaften which are granted a higher degree of political self-rule. Both entities are further divided into several subdistricts, called Stadtteile and Ortsteile.

The Galactic Earth Federation, or G.E.F, has steadily grown and conquered planet after planet. They serve as the villains of the story. The story centers, however, around the captain and crew of the spaceship Excelsior--the only ship in the galaxy that actually picks its captain. As the narrative begins, the ship picks a new captain. This happens to be Zap Vexler, much to the consternation of Excelsior's crew. Cast=Excelsior= Excelsior is the ship of which Zap is the captain. Robot refers to it as a \\"her,\\" and she is the only ship in the galaxy that chooses her own captain. Zap Vexler Captain of the Excelsior, though no one knows why. Brash and rather obnoxious, Zap came into the story fleeing from the G.E.F. he has somehow lost his memory; his earliest memories are sitting in a bar three days prior to boarding the Excelsior, listening to a drunk babble about a Galactic Resistance and then blaming him when G.E.F. forces arrive. Zap is rather childish, this may be a side effect of memory loss. He constantly argues with Robot and Grontar, and repeatedly hits on Reona. However, he has a more serious side, which manifests mainly in his deep devotion to Reona and his psychic abilities. He forgot his psychic ability along with everything else; however, as the story unfolds, his abilities are revealed as being far above that of an average psychic. Reona Lightstar First Mate of the Excelsior. The only female member of the crew, she has to endure Zap's constant flirting as well as getting the crew out of the various scrapes Zap gets them into. Her former love, Efrem, was the earlier captain of the Excelsior and is believed dead, something Reona is still coming to grips with. Grontar Grott Grontar is a Quadrillian, a large, strong, four-armed humanoid species. He is the ship's mechanic and is very dedicated to Reona. Robot Originally known as XR-7439-Q, but one of Zap's first acts as \\"captain\\" was to order the robot to change his hard-to- remember designation to just Robot, for which he has never forgiven Zap. His job is to interface directly with the Excelcior (since his persona is male and the ship's is female, this can get rather intimate). Prone to snide comments about the intelligence of his crewmates, especially Zap. Kasey Kasey is a Stickle, a lion-like creature, who originates from Sticklebat 7. The other six were, in Kasey's words, \\"too flammable\\", and according to Grontar, destroyed by the Stickle's malfunctioning devices. She refers to Robot as \\"Sparky\\" and treats him like a superstar. Despite her carefree, happy exterior, she is sad and lonely on the inside. =Galactic Earth Federation= As human territories expanded, they needed to be governed.

The Art of the Nomads The early history of the Nomads is not well recorded, which changed after their contact with cultures possessing written history. Nomadic people of the vast steppes of Asia were a major force in history.The Perilous Frontier by Thomas J. Barfield, lackwell Publishers, 1989 Their power was not in the empires they built, but rather the turmoil they created among ancient civilizations such as China or Persia, impacting their historical development substantially.Warriors of the Steppe by Erik Hildinger, De Capo Press, 1997, pp. 57-92 It is believed that the nomads ranged widely, forever moving on for sake of richer grazing for their horses and sheep. Migrations were often seasonal. Their skill at extracting gold was unprecedented. In summer, during the tribe's seasonal migration, a fleece would be weighted on a riverbed to collect particles of alluvial gold. Upon the tribes' return, the fleece would be sheared, burned, and a gold ingot the size of a horse's hoof would result. The tay tayak (the horse's hoof) was a unit of gold for a long period, which was used as a measure of an amount of golden metal rather than money, since gold was not fabricated as currency. Using gold was a spiritual practice, as emblems of priestly office, prizes for physical prowess in ritual sport, or as adornment of the sacral ceremony of marriage.Kazakhstan, Coming of Age by Michael Fergus and Janar Jandosova, Stacey International 2003, p.106 ()  References  See also  * Iranian art * History of decorative arts * Toreutics * Asian art * Treasure of Nagyszentmikl√≥s * Hunnic Empire * Xiongnu * Scythian art * Thraco-Cimmerian * Turko-Persian tradition Category:Art history Category:Late Roman Empire art Category:Sasanian art Category:Iconography ","title":"Persian-Sassanid art patterns"},{"id":"10373736","text":"James Moody (1907‚Äì1995) (not to be confused with American saxophonist James Moody) was a Belfast-born pianist, arranger and composer best known for his music for classical harmonica, including twenty-two works for harmonica and piano, three works for harmonica and strings, eight works for harmonica and orchestra, and some two dozen other works for instrumental combinations such as harmonica and harp, harmonica and string quartet, and harmonica ensemble. He also arranged a lot of other music for harmonica, for example Irish, Scottish, English, and Norwegian folk melodies.

The dispute was about restraint of trade, and the judgment declares when such a restraint (which is prima facie void) may become valid. The case also established the \\"Blue pencil doctrine\\" as a method for deciding whether contractual obligations can be partially enforced when the obligation as drafted in the contract has an element of illegality. Facts Thorsten Nordenfelt, a manufacturer specialising in armaments, had sold his business to Hiram Stevens Maxim. They had agreed that Nordenfelt ‚Äòwould not make guns or ammunition anywhere in the world, and would not compete with Maxim in any way for a period of 25 years‚Äô. Judgment The House of Lords held that the restraint was reasonable in the interests of the parties. They placed emphasis on the ¬£200,000 that Thomas Nordenfeldt had received as full value for his sale.[1894] AC 535 Restraint of trade clauses were prima facie void at common law, but they may be deemed valid if three conditions are met: * the terms seek to protect a legitimate interest * the terms are reasonable in scope from the viewpoint of the parties involved * the terms are reasonable in scope from the viewpoint of public policy. The question on severability was whether the reasonable restriction could be enforced when it was in the same contract as an unreasonable and unenforceable restriction. The court used the test of whether striking out (with a blue pencil) words containing unreasonable provisions would leave behind a contractual obligation that still made sense. If it did, then the amended contract would be enforced by the court. In this case, the unreasonable restraint was severable, and the court enforced the amended agreement that Nordenfelt \\"for the next 25 years, would not make guns or ammunition anywhere in the world \\" thus permitting him to trade in those very items in direct competition with Maxim, illustrating the limited practical utility of the rule under its strike-out only stricture.

It is signalled throughout with the signals being controlled from New Barn Station which also serves as a terminus.  The stations = New Barn = This station is the largest on the line. It has three platforms, a turntable, a ticket office and a signal box. All trains stop at this station, so they can be turned around and be prepared to travel back along the line. This process will often be performed by the juniors giving the drivers a quick break. Passengers are required to go through the ticket office and obtain tickets before they board the train (in the case of those starting their journey at New Barn) or get their tickets as they disembark (if they have travelled from Swanley Parkway). The platforms have been upgraded to the same standard as Swanley Parkway. Though this station has capacity for three trains at one time, this rarely happens except on gala days. There are three platforms and a locomotive loop line where the engines can run around and couple back up to the train. The turntable is manually operated, and a signal directs the operator to a certain line. The station was previously called Lakeside. = Swanley Parkway = This station is a single platform station located near the car park. Passengers board the train here and then proceed to New Barn station to disembark. The journey from this station to New Barn should take around three minutes. This station was made higher when the platform was redeveloped in 2006, making it easier for passengers to board and leave the train. There are some early plans for increasing the capacity of the station by adding a passing loop to create a second line to the station. It is unsure whether a separate platform to serve the second line will be built or the current platform will be converted to an Island Platform. This station was previously called New Barn Halt.  The signal box  The signal box is located at New Barn Station, which is the larger of the two stations on the line. During the first year of the railway, a signal box was created to help control the points and signals around the station area. The signalman can see where the trains are by using the track circuits which are installed throughout the line. The track layout has been changed several times, all of the major changes are recorded to the left of the track diagram. The signal box was formally named Holborn Crossing in 2013 in memory of the society founding member Christopher Johnson, who during his BR career had been an area manager covering Holborn Viaduct, with the absence of a viaduct the last part was changed to 'crossing'. The signal box utilises two automatic modes of operation, which means that if there is a lack of staff, the railway line remains operational. The signal box frame has 35 levers, all of which are fully interlocked. The interlocking works with the track circuits and point detection. Which levers are locked is decided by the signal box computer which receives points positions, track circuit data and lever information to decide if it is possible to set a route that will not cause a train to be sent in the wrong direction or be sent on a route where another train is set to cross the track in front of it. The points are worked by 12 V windscreen wiper motors which have been adjusted so that they stop in one of two positions. They are controlled by the signal box computer which is in turn controlled by the levers. The direction that the points are set to is detected by two microswitches located under the points. The majority of signals are powered by a 12-volt AC supply. The main signal that everyone sees is the one that passengers pass on their way into the station. It has three 20 W bulbs which allow the signal to be seen clearly no matter what the conditions are. The signal located at the platform on Swanley Parkway is powered by a 110 V transformer located inside the signal box.  Locomotives = Steam engines = * Owd Rosie - 2-6-2T: Painted brown, it is similar to a Tinkerbell class locomotive. * Montezuma - 2-8-0: It was mainly seen running on Sundays with her American style wagons. Now painted Midnight Blue, and waiting boiler work to re-enter service (which was expected to be 2012). * Mallard - 4-6-2: This locomotive is the only scale model based at the railway. It is a model of the full-size engine of the same name (the Mallard), which broke the world speed record for steam locomotives in 1938. This model was used in the filming of the Sky advert, shown during Christmas 2012. * Sir Goss - 2-4-0T: This was the main steam locomotive in the fleet. It is occasionally seen at the Moors Valley Railway. It is painted in black livery. Sir Goss has now gone in for a complete overhaul. * Prince Sheian - 2-4-0: This locomotive entered service 3 April 2010 and is painted red. Despite being three years younger than Suisaidh she has already completed more passenger miles, and is the main stay of the steam engine fleet. * Suisaidh - 2-4-4T: Built on and off site, based on the engine Jason from the Moors Valley Railway painted in LNER apple green, she entered passenger service in December 2007. * Aneirin - Single fairlie, 0-4-4T: Based on Talieslin of the Ffestiniog railway. Entered service October 2015. Built by P. Beevers. * Mrs. Darling - a Tinkerbell based design, 0-4-2T: Based on Tinkerbell of the Moors Valley railway. Entered service August 2017. Built by P. Jackson. = Diesel engines = * Tulyar - Arrived on site in 1987, now painted in a two-tone green livery. She is the most-used engine on the railway and completed of passenger service in 20 years.The Tulyar * Kestrel - Arrived on site in 1999, the yellow livery features a Hawker Siddeley logo with permission. * SNCF - Arrived on site in 2001, based on the older style French SNCF locomotive which is now based in a museum. * Tegen - 4wd. Build in house by John Deans. Sit in style narrow gauge diesel. Freelance design. * Skipper- A freelance narrow gauge diesel engine. Arriving for testing in early 2011, she was expected to enter service in April 2011 (after receiving her shiny new paint). Skipper was expertly built by Peter Beevers and is the fourth sit in diesel outline engine he has built (2 are at Barking Light railway). The engine has a sideways sitting seat to allow shunting to be completed easily. * Western Enterprise - Arrived on site in May 2012, built by the same company as Tulyar, Hymek, County of Kent, Kestrel and SNCF. Western Enterprise is based on a BR Western diesel. * Robert F Fairlie - Arrived on site in August 2012, second new diesel engine of 2012, and mechanically similar to Western Enterprise and also Made by Mardyke Miniature Railways. Painted in Large logo BR livery and is the second class 47 to be based at the SNBR. * Niseag - Arrived on site in August 2013. Mechanically similar to Western Enterprise and also made by Mardyke Miniature Railways. Painted in NSE livery and is the third class 47 to be based at the SNBR. *Phoenix, entered Service 8th August 2015 This loco is intended a test bed for ideas to improve the design of the existing diesel fleet. It is anticipated that any improvements will be incorporated in the specification of future locos. Like the mythical bird from which it takes its name, it is likely to be reborn with different features. The basic chassis is an old Mardyke one which started life under the Kestrel body, its body originated as old concept version of a Eurostar body, but has been extensively re-modelled. Its first task is to test a new type of hydraulic pump with a view to replacing the existing ones in use with the hope improving reliability and drivability. *SNCF The SNCF arrived in 2001, after being purchased by one of the SNBR members, and is the 5th Mardyke Diesel to be based at the SNBR. She is mechanically similar to her sisters, although she sports different bogie frames to other 6 wheel bogie mardyke diesels. She is affectionally known as Sniffer as sort of short form of SNCF which is the other name she is known by. The sniffer originally ran at the SNBR Kestrel weekend, when she was borrowed by the SNBR to celebrate the event. = Other motive power = * Steptoe - BR class 25 engine, used occasionally. * \\"Nipa\\" - This is a freelance sit in petrol engine, mainly used as the P-Way engine, rarely used for passenger service. Build in-house in 2013. Was on loan to the Fancott Miniature Railway from early July to early November 2015. * Yellow Peril - This is a small battery-powered vehicle that uses a car battery for power. It is occasionally used to transport wheelbarrows around site. This has been expertly built by two of the juniors.  Vandalism and events  The railway commonly has to deal with issues of vandalism, including smashed windows. Damage to the electrical wiring for signals and track circuits. On one occasion graffiti appeared on a platform overnight. The track is occasionally lifted overnight, making it unsuitable for the trains to run on it. Once a burnt-out car was found littering the tracks. Galas Periodically the railway holds special events: *Charity Day: This is held on 1 January each year and is operated by steam engines only. *1812 night: An annual Swanley Park event including fireworks and a band. The railway operates a special service up to the launch of the 1st firework. *Summer gala: Started for the 30th birthday event, these have continued every summer since, with miniature traction engines, stalls and visiting engines on the main line\\".

He subsequently submitted to Emperor Gaozu of Tang and was created the Prince of Yan and granted the imperial surname of Li. He subsequently, in the struggle between Emperor Gaozu's sons Li Jiancheng the Crown Prince and Li Shimin the Prince of Qin, joined Li Jiancheng's faction. After Li Shimin killed Li Jiancheng in 626 and forced Emperor Gaozu to yield the throne to him (as Emperor Taizong), Li Yi was fearful, and he rebelled against Emperor Taizong in 627. He was soon defeated and killed.  Initial uprising  Luo Yi's clan was originally from Xiangyang (Ë•ÑÈôΩ, in modern Xiangfan, Hubei), but moved from there to the Sui capital Chang'an. Luo Yi's father Luo Rong (ÁæÖÊ¶Æ) was a minor general during Sui. Luo Yi was said to be intelligent, self- confident, and capable in battle, but unkind. Due to his contributions on the battlefield, by the latter part of the reign of Emperor Yang of Sui, Luo was a key army officer at Beiping (ÂåóÂπ≥, in modern Qinhuangdao, Hebei), under the command of the general Li Jing (ÊùéÊôØ). Luo's was said to be strict in his discipline of soldiers, but he himself was arrogant even toward Li. Li often rebuked him, and he therefore resented Li. By 616, nearby Zhuo Commandery (Ê∂øÈÉ°, roughly modern Beijing) was constantly under pillaging attacks by agrarian rebels, as Emperor Yang had stored much military supplies and placed many soldiers at Zhuo Commandery for his campaigns against Goguryeo, and nearby Linshuo Palace (Ëá®ÊúîÂÆÆ) contained much imperial treasure. The military officers in charge of defending the city, Zhao Shizhu (Ë∂ô‰ªÄ‰Ωè), Helan Yi (Ë≥ÄËò≠Ë™º), and Jin Wenyan (ÊôâÊñáË°ç) were all unable to stop the pillaging raids, but Luo often battled these agrarian rebels and prevailed, earning him greater reputation than the others. Zhao, who was in overall command, greatly suspected Luo. Luo, who considered rebelling against Sui rule, incited his soldiers by telling them: :\\"We attack the bandits and often prevailed. However, even though the food supplies are stacked like mountains inside the city, the commander [i.e., Zhao] is unwilling to distribute them to the hungry people. How can the officers and soldiers be encouraged by this?\\" After Luo returned from an attack on the rebels, he arrested the commandery secretary general, and Zhao, in fear, submitted to him. Luo distributed the stored wealth and food to the soldiers and the people and executed several officials who were not willing to follow his orders. A number of Sui cities, including as far as Liucheng (Êü≥Âüé, in modern Zhaoyang, Liaoning) and Huaiyuan (Êá∑ÈÅ†, in modern Shenyang, Liaoning), submitted to him. He claimed for himself the office of commandant at Youzhou (ÂπΩÂ∑û, i.e., Zhuo Commandery), using an office title that was often used during the reign of Emperor Yang's father Emperor Wen but had been abolished by Emperor Yang.  Submission to Tang  Map showing major uprisings and rebellions in the last years of Sui dynasty. Luo Yi controls the Youzhou region which is close to modern Beijing. In spring 618, Emperor Yang, while at Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), was killed in a coup led by the general Yuwen Huaji, who declared Emperor Yang's nephew Yang Hao emperor. Yuwen sent messengers to Luo Yi, trying to persuade him to submit. Luo responded, \\"I am still a Sui subject.\\" He executed Yuwen's messengers and declared a mourning period for Emperor Yang‚Äîalbeit only for three days, not for the Confucian traditional three years or the shortened 36-day period as modified by Emperor Wen of Han. Subsequently, the rebel leaders Dou Jiande the Prince of Xia and Gao Kaidao both sent messengers to try to get him to submit, but Luo, viewing Dou and Gao as bandits, refused. Rather, hearing that the Sui general Li Yuan had taken the throne at Chang'an and established Tang Dynasty (as its Emperor Gaozu), Luo decided to submit to him, through the Tang general Zhang Daoyuan (ÂºµÈÅìÊ∫ê). Around the new year 619, Emperor Gaozu commissioned Luo as the commandant at Youzhou. He subsequently repelled an attack from Dou. In winter 619, Emperor Gaozu created Luo the Prince of Yan Commandery and bestowed the imperial surname of Li on him, and he thereafter became known as Li Yi. Around the same time, he repelled another Dou attack. Dou attacked again in summer 620, and he again repelled the attack, with Gao's aid. Gao thereafter submitted to Tang as well, through him. In 621, Emperor Gaozu's son Li Shimin the Prince of Qin (the eventual Emperor Taizong) captured Dou, and Emperor Gaozu executed Dou. For a short duration, Dou's domain submitted to Tang, but subsequently Dou's generals rose against Tang, led by Liu Heita. Emperor Gaozu sent a number of generals against Liu and ordered Li Yi to attack Liu from the north. Liu, however, was successful in defeating all Tang generals sent against him, including Li Yi, and regaining all of Dou's territory. Meanwhile, Youzhou was suffering from a famine. Gao agreed to supply Youzhou with food, and when Li Yi sent the weaker of his men to Wei Province to save them from the famine, Gao treated them well. Li Yi was pleased, and he sent three thousand men with several hundred wagons and over 1,000 horses and donkeys to Wei Prefecture to transport food. Gao, however, turned against Li Yi and kept all of them, breaking off the relations with Li Yi and Tang Dynasty. He allied himself with Eastern Tujue to the north and Liu to the south. In 622, with Li Shimin attacking Liu, Li Yi led his forces to join Li Shimin to attack Liu's capital at Ming Prefecture (Ê¥∫Â∑û, in modern Handan, Hebei). After the armies stalemated for several months, Li Shimin defeated Liu by using the waters of the nearby Ming River to drown Liu's army, forcing Liu to flee to Eastern Tujue. Li Yi returned to his post at Youzhou. Late that year, however, Liu returned with Eastern Tujue aid, and Li Yi was unable to repel him, although Liu was subsequently defeated by Li Shimin's brother Li Jiancheng the Crown Prince and killed in early 623. In spring 623 as well, Li Yi requested that he leave his post and serve at the capital Chang'an instead. He was made a general in the imperial army.  Involvement in the struggle between Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin  It appeared that soon after arriving in the capital, Li Yi became a close associate to Li Jiancheng, who was then locked in a struggle with Li Shimin for power, as while Li Jiancheng was older and legally Emperor Gaozu's successor, Li Shimin was more famous, had contributed more to Tang's establishment, and enjoyed greater loyalty from the army. On one occasion, when Li Shimin sent messengers to Li Yi, Li Yi had them bound and battered, drawing Emperor Gaozu's ire. Emperor Gaozu briefly arrested Li Yi, but soon released and restored him. On another occasion in 624, Li Jiancheng, against Emperor Gaozu's regulations, requisitioned the elite soldiers from under Li Yi's command to augment his own guards, and when this was discovered, Emperor Gaozu rebuked Li Jiancheng and exiled his guard commander Keda Zhi (ÂèØÈÅîÂøó). In summer 625, with Tang's capital region Guanzhong being under constant raids by Eastern Tujue, Emperor Gaozu repositioned a number of generals to try to defend against these raids, and as part of the movement, forces under Li Yi's command were placed at Huating (ËèØ‰∫≠, in modern Pingliang, Gansu) and Tanzheng Canyon (ÂΩàÁÆèÂ≥Ω, in modern Guyuan, Ningxia). In summer 626, with Eastern Tujue attacking again, Emperor Gaozu commissioned another son, Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi, who was part of Li Jiancheng's faction, to lead troops against Eastern Tujue, and Li Yi was assigned to be under Li Yuanji's command. However, at this time, Li Shimin, apparently fearful that Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji were about to kill him, acted first, ambushing Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji and killing them at the Incident at Xuanwu Gate, and then effectively forced Emperor Gaozu to first create him crown prince, and then two months later yield the throne to him (as Emperor Taizong).  Death  Emperor Taizong declared a general pardon of Li Jiancheng's and Li Yuanji's staff members and incorporated a number of Li Jiancheng's advisors into his own administration. Still, having had conflicts with Li Shimin before, Li Yi was fearful. Meanwhile, the witch Li Wujie (Êùé‰∫îÊàí) was a close associate with Li Yi's wife Princess Meng, informing her that both she and Li Yi were beginning to show signs of great glory. Both Li Wujie and Meng then persuaded him to rebel. Li Yi agreed, and, in spring 627, Li Yi pretended to receive a secret order from Emperor Taizong to return to Chang'an from his then-defense post at Yi Prefecture (ÂÆúÂ∑û, in modern Tongchuan, Shaanxi). He seized Zhao Cihao (Ë∂ôÊÖàÁöì) the secretary general of Bin Prefecture (Ë±≥Â∑û, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi) and occupied Bin. Emperor Taizong sent his brother-in-law Zhangsun Wuji against Li Yi, but even before Zhangsun's arrival, Zhao's associate Yang Ji (Ê•äÂ≤å) attacked Li Yi, whose forces collapsed. Li Yi tried to flee to Eastern Tujue, but when he arrived at Wushi (ÁÉèÊ∞è, in modern Pingliang), his associates assassinated him and cut off his head to be delivered to Chang'an. Emperor Taizong had his head hung in the streets and changed his name back to Luo, excising him from the imperial clan rolls. His wife Princess Meng, Li Wujie, and his brother Luo Shou (ÁæÖÂ£Ω) were all executed.

Homolovi or Homol'ovi (the Hopi spelling of the word) is a Hopi word meaning \\"place of the little hills\\". The park is located just over a mile north of Winslow, Arizona, and features historical exhibits, interpretive programs, birdwatching, and hiking. There is a year-round campground, restrooms with showers and an RV dump station. The park was closed to visitors from February 22, 2010 to March 18, 2011 due to state budget cuts.http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2011/03/17/20110317homolovi-ruins- state-park-name-change.html From 1986 to its 2011 reopening, the name of the park was Homolovi Ruins State Park. The Hopi tribe lobbied the Arizona parks board to remove \\"Ruins\\" from the name, as the Hopi tribe considers them spiritually alive. During a meeting in Winslow on March 17, 2011, the board unanimously voted to change the name and to add the tagline \\"ancestral Hopi villages\\" to the park.  History  The Homol'ovi cluster of archaeological sites includes seven separate pueblo ruins built by various prehistoric people, including ancestors of the Hopi people, between approximately 1260-1400 AD. This fertile area is on a floodplain of the Little Colorado River, and the inhabitants grew cotton, corn, beans, and squash. The people of this period are called Hisat'sinom, which is the Hopi word for \\"long-ago people\\". They are often referred to as Anasazi, as the Navajo guides who helped nineteenth-century anthropologists and archaeologists called them. However, the word \\"Anasazi\\" is Navajo for \\"enemies of our ancestors\\", and the present-day Hopi population prefer to refer to them as the Hisat'sinom. Four of the sites are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Exhibits and activities  The visitor center displayed pottery sherds, baskets, and other artifacts, as well as offering an introduction to the human history of the park area. Information could also be found about the flora and fauna of the park, and there were books and authentic Hopi art work for sale. Out of the seven Homolovi ruins, two were open to visitors. Homolovi II, the largest and most thoroughly excavated site, has a sidewalk and interpretive signs. It was occupied between 1330 and 1400 AD, and has about 1200 rooms. Archaeologists believe that the inhabitants were trading cotton for pottery with the inhabitants of the Hopi Mesas. This ruin also features three large rectangular plazas and about forty kivas (underground ceremonial chambers). There are also several clusters of pit-houses, occupied before 1260 AD, which appear as mere depressions in the earth. Petroglyphs may be seen along certain sections of a nearby trail (Tsu'vo). Sunset, Arizona‚Äîone of a series of farming communities along the Little Colorado River in the late 1870s‚Äîwas established by Lot Smith and his Mormon followers. Frequent floods forced the settlers to abandon Sunset in the early 1880s, and the community was eventually washed away. The cemetery, located on a small hill overlooking the river, survived and can be visited. Three of Lot Smith's children are among the cemetery population. Hikers, mountain bikers, and horseback riders could use the of unshaded dirt roads in the park along with the trails leading to archaeological sites.  Wildlife  A bird checklist, available at the visitor center, listed of over 100 species that can be found in the area. These include notable species such as hawks, golden eagles, killdeer, Gambel's quail, great blue herons, and red-shafted flickers. Many mammals can also be seen in the park, such as gray foxes, bobcats, badgers, prairie dogs, desert cottontails, jackrabbits, and porcupines. Reptiles found in the area include the Hopi rattlesnake, western king rattlesnake, horned lizards, common collared lizards, bull snakes, and desert spiny lizards.

It was released in South Korea on February 18, 2005 and pulled in a total of 289,829 admissions. Plot The plot centers around the relationship of a 15-year-old couple, Jenny (Park Min-ji) and Juno (Kim Hye-sung), who meet in school. Jenny is a smart, bright and pretty girl. Juno is cute, cool and good at sports, and just got transferred from another school. When Jenny discovers that she is pregnant, she and Juno decide against having an abortion, opting for parenthood instead. Juno starts delivering newspapers to earn additional money to buy the food that Jenny desires. Juno strives to carry out the duties of a good father, and always stays at Jenny's side, taking care of Jenny's nutrition for the sake of their baby. Jenny becomes jealous due to her condition and gets into a mishap with Pyoy, a girl trying to flirt with Juno. Juno breaks up the fight and asks Jenny to never do that again because of worry for their baby. They even go to places for pregnant women, practise an exercise for pregnant mothers and spend their time together at school and outside. They go out one day a date and take a boat out on a lake, but the ropes that bound the boat are lost and they are left stranded. They try to seek help but there is no mobile phone connection. They wait there until midnight, when a fisherman arrives and sends both of them back home. Jenny gets scolded by her mother for returning late. They try to conceal the pregnancy from their families for as long as possible, but the truth is revealed eventually when Jenny's middle sister finds out about her pregnancy. Jenny and Juno tell their parents about her pregnancy, but they do not approve. Jenny is scheduled to be sent to the U.S. where her eldest sister lives, but her parents refuse to allow the two to meet anymore. The two get married later in the month with the assistance of their classmates. One day, Juno's friend tells him that Jenny is confirmed to be sent to U.S. None of them however can reach her. Juno keeps waiting in front of Jenny's home to meet her but her mother and sister keep avoiding him. Juno then follows Jenny's sister, and because she cannot bear his sadness, she tells him that Jenny was in the mansion. When Juno finds her, Jenny's water breaks and she is then rushed to the hospital, and gives birth to a boy.

Although there is no sex scene between the protagonists, the film was initially given a rating of 18+, but this was lowered to 15+ upon appeal. Critics expressed concerns that the film's presentation of teenage pregnancy was unrealistic, in that Jenny is from a well-to-do, secure family that is able to support her decision, and that this might send the wrong message to less fortunate teens. Kim Ho-jun, the film's director, responded to this criticism by stating: > Jenny and Juno are certainly wayward children who should have never done a > thing they did for their age. But it was an accident that they made the > mistake and their love is in a way innocent. What should be really > criticized is not the couple but adults who only say 'no.' This film shows > how they make a mistake but how we should take responsibility. Similarities to Juno There are several similarities of Jenny, Juno to the 2007 American comedy film Juno, which also deals with teenage pregnancy and features a character with the name Juno (Jenny‚Äôs boyfriend). The film's screenwriter, Diablo Cody, commented on the coincidence in October 2007, stating that she had been unaware of the existence of Jenny, Juno prior to her own film's release. She said that, although she had not previously watched Jenny, Juno, she is now interested in seeing it.

The Armor Modeling and Preservation Society (AMPS) is a social club with the common interest of modeling miniature armored fighting vehicles, military model figures, ordnance, dioramas, and related equipment and promotion of historic military vehicle restoration. AMPS is an international club headquartered in the United States History and purpose Several AMPS members talking with a museum volunteer in front of a World War II-vintage Sherman tank. Clubs centered around the hobby of modeling have existed since the 1950s. The Armor Modeling and Preservation Society, Inc. was founded in 1993 by armor modelers as a means of promoting the hobby using the 'open system' of contest judging. AMPS was formed as a membership club to promote the hobby of armor modeling, with bylaws that prevented any officer from deriving their income from the hobby of military vehicle modeling. The club operated without incorporation until early 2007, when it was incorporated as a not-for-profit corporation in the state of New York. In 2011 AMPS gained recognition from the US federal government as a 501(c)(4) tax-exempt organization. AMPS has several purposes: *The first is a social function, providing a means for those interested in the hobby of model military vehicle building (including model figure building as well as diorama building) and restoration to associate with other hobbyists. *A second is educational; AMPS events and publications provide detailed historical information on actual armored fighting vehicles, ordnance, and the history of their usage, as well as providing techniques for improving scale models, figures and dioramas. *Finally, AMPS provides some funding for restoration of actual military vehicles and makes charitable contributions to morale-building efforts for service members serving in combat areas (see below). Structure and membership The model display area at the 2008 AMPS International convention. The AMPS bylaws and constitution provide for an Executive Board consisting of a President, First Vice-President, eight regional Second Vice Presidents, and a Secretary. Additional non-elected officers include Treasurer, Publications Editor, and Marketing Director/Public Information Officer, Web Master and Chief Judge. The founder and first President of AMPS was Steven \\"Cookie\\" Sewell. The current president is John Charvat. Membership is open to anyone with an interest in the hobby. Annual membership fees are $30 for members in the United States, $35 in Canada and $40 in other countries. Almost all members are located in the USA, Canada, the UK and Mexico. Currently, AMPS has just over 700 members. = Local chapters = The vendor area at the 2007 International show AMPS members often form local 'chapters' of the society. These local clubs operate as part of AMPS but their local base allow their members to meet (usually monthly) and share hobby skills, materials and references. Current active AMPS chapters and affiliate chapters include: *KCAMPS: Kansas City, Missouri *AMPS Centex, Austin, Texas (Austin Armor Builders Society) *Patton's Best/AMPS Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky *AMPS Albany, Albany, New York *AMPS-Chicagoland, Chicago, Illinois area *AMPS Indy, Indianapolis, Indiana *CVAMPS, Central Virginia AMPS (Richmond area) *AMPS Mexico (Mexico City area) *AMPS Dallas, Texas *AMPS Eastern Pennsylvania *AMPS Atlanta, Georgia *AMPS Frontiersman, Buffalo, New York *Central Florida AMPS *Washington Armor Club (Washington D.C. area) *AMPS SoCal Los Angeles, California area *Western Front AMPS San Jose, California *AMPS Ottawa: Ottawa, Ontario, Canada *AMPS Southwestern Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada *AMPS New Zealand *AMPS Paris, France *AMPS Northwest, Tacoma, Washington *BRAG (Blue Ridge Armor Geeks): Lynchburg, Virginia *AMPS Israel *AMPS Tijuana, Mexico *Lone Star Armor Brigade (AMPS San Antonio), San Antonio, Texas = Benefits of membership = Membership in AMPS gives the modelers several benefits: :a) Voting rights in the society. AMPS members vote on officers and thus the direction of the society. :b) Discounted admission to all AMPS shows. :c) Discounted pricing from numerous armor-modeling-related firms who have partnered with AMPS. :d) Six issues per year of the society journal, Boresight. Publications AMPS publishes a semi-monthly journal, Boresight. Articles in Boresight are written by the members, and the publication itself is edited by volunteers. The journal typically provides several articles on real armored vehicles for reference purposes, along with modeling articles and how-to guides. AMPS accepts advertising in Boresight as a means of providing discounted hobby products to its members. Initially the publication was produced in a black and white format, the magazine is now a professionally produced publication an all color format. AMPS also has an official society Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/AMPSArmor/ Events The \\"Judging Pit\\" in which model entries are evaluated; this example is at the AMPS 2006 International Convention Judges evaluating a model entry at the AMPS 2006 International Convention AMPS informational table at the IPMS-USA National convention, Anaheim California, Aug 2007 The major event hosted by AMPS is the annual International Convention, held each April. This three-day show brings together hundreds of members and non-members to view models, participate in a model contest, buy hobby products, view actual military vehicles, and attend seminars. Recent international conventions have included over 500 scale models on display. The most recent international show was held April 7‚Äì9, 2016 in Sumter, South Carolina.Boresight, May/June 2016, p. 6 Seminar speakers usually include tank crew veterans, well-known modelers and researchers, and industry representatives from firms such as Tamiya and AFV Club. The 2010 show was the most successful AMPS show ever with 634 models entered as well as club display tables. Smaller regional and local contests are also held from time to time, typically attracting 100+ scale models for single-day events. *AMPS East is an East Coast USA show, held annually since 1999, normally in the western Connecticut (in recent years) or northern New Jersey (formerly) area. *AMPS Centex is a midwest show held in Austin, Texas every other year. *Kansas City AMPS holds a show every October in Kansas City, Missouri. *AMPS Atlanta holds a show each February since 2009. *Central Virginia AMPS has held three regionals in the Richmond, Virginia area The scale models entered in the contest are judged according to the AMPS Contest Rules, and may be awarded Gold, Silver or Bronze medals. Scale models are judged for accuracy, level of detail, skill in construction, and paint/markings finish. Some of these models take hundreds of hours to complete. Each modeler is provided with a feedback form showing the points given in each area and what areas need to improve. An 'open' system of judging is used in which each model competes against a standard, not against other entries. Thus, instead of 1st, 2nd and 3rd-place medals, awards are given to all models that reach specified cutoff scores. Since participants are not competing against one another, there is no disincentive to the sharing of techniques and ideas. The feedback provided in these events is a key factor in helping modelers improve. The AMPS system provides formal feedback, giving specific information about what to improve in the model. =AMPS Masters= An 'AMPS Master' is a modeler who has either won \\"Best of Show\\" at the AMPS convention or who is recognized by AMPS as a Master-level modeler due to other accomplishments.Boresight, May/June 2016, p. 9 The current AMPS Masters (recognized as masters although never 'Best of Show' winners) are: Tony Englehart Mark Ford Paul Gaertner Dave Kahn Dave Lockhart Mike McFadden Mark Muller Mike Roof Stephen 'Cookie' Sewell Dan Tisoncik Steve Zaloga Masters awarded at conventions are: 1995: Ken Davis 1996: Bob Collignon 1997: Dave Dean 1998: Bob Clifton 1999: Mike Siggins and Chris Mrosko 2000: Roger Lang 2001: Lynn Kessler 2002: Charlie Prichett 2003: Jason Jennings 2004: Douglas Lee 2005: Alexander DeLeon 2006: Don Barclay 2007: Mark Hazzard 2008: Steve Milstone-Turner 2009: Tom Jett 2010: Mark Corbett 2011: Cesar (Manny) Rodriguez 2012: Jim Weschler 2013: John Kesner 2014: Chris Durden 2015: Dave Vickers 2016: Tony Zadro Charitable activities A few of the over 1,500 kits AMPS members have donated to Coalition troops in Iraq. AMPS recently launched a clearinghouse project to gather donations of plastic model kits and supplies for shipment to United States military personnel deployed to combat areas. Nearly 2000 kits and hundreds of supply items and books have been sent overseas to help morale and alleviate stress and boredom; additional shipments will follow.

In general, Polypay sheep are noted for being a highly prolific maternal dual-purpose (meat and wool) breed. It produces yearly about 4.2 kg of wool and is weaned at 120 days. History A Polypay ewe tends to her newly born triplets. Dr. Clarence V. Hulet, at the U.S. Sheep Experiment Station in Dubois, Idaho, had five main goals when creating the new breed. *High lifetime prolificacy *Large lamb crop at one year of age *Ability to lamb more frequently than once per year *Rapid growth rate of lambs *Desirable carcass quality The original breeding stock were taken from the Finnsheep for their high prolificacy, early puberty and short gestation, Dorset for their superior mothering ability, carcass quality, early puberty and long breeding season, Targhee for their large body size, long breeding season and quality fleeces, and Rambouillet for their adaptability, hardiness, productivity and quality fleeces. In 1968, Hulet performed the first cross breedings generating Finnsheep x Rambouillet (F x R) and Dorset x Targhee (D x T) lambs, which were born in 1969. The first 4-breed composites (F x R x D x T) were made in 1970. After seeing the potential and enthusiasm for the new breed, Hulet coined the name for the breed in 1975. The Polypay name was created from poly, meaning multiple, and pay, meaning return on investment. Pay also means the ability the breed has to contribute more than two paying \\"crops\\" each year, i.e. two lamb crops and one wool crop. The American Polypay Association was then later formed in 1980. Ram lambs at the 2017 APSA National Sale. The community of Polypay breeders is active and continues to grow to develop the breed. Currently, there are about 100 members of the American Polypay Association and there are typically about 1,500 animals registered each year. In 1987, the National Sheep Improvement Program (NSIP)] was initiated and included the Polypay breed. Through the efforts of the breeders enrolled in the program, breeders have been able to significantly enhance the breed characteristics. There are currently 41 breeders and 1,244 animals were added to the NSIP in 2016. There are nearly 14,000 animals in the registry. Each year there are national sales that highlight the breed in Sedalia, MO, Spencer, IA and Wooster, OH. These sales incorporate traditional conformational characteristics as well as estimated breeding values (EBVs) generated through the NSIP. Breed characteristics To be registered as a Polypay, an animal must be the offspring of registered parents, of parents each containing 1/4 Rambouillet, 1/4 Targhee, 1/4 Dorset, and 1/4 Finnsheep blood, or of a registered sire and some other combination of foundation breeding, which would produce at least a 15/16 Polypay offspring. Furthermore, the animal must: # Be free of gross anatomical or physical defects (Entropian eyes, etc) # Not be subject to wool blindness # Have a smooth body from neck folds # Have no color in fleece and less than 10% color (black or brown) in the hairy parts of the head and legs. # No extreme britchiness or extreme coarseness of wool. # Be polled. Nor scurs in ewes. Scurs in rams are undesirable and should be strongly discriminated against. # Incisor teeth must touch the dental pad. In general, Polypay ewes are able to lamb at 1 year of age, wean twins, and mature ewes will weigh between 150 and 200 lbs. Mature Polypay rams will weigh between 240 and 300 lbs. All animals entered in a show or sale should be a twin or better and all ewes shown in a Yearling Ewe Class must have already lambed. Although Polypays are a general purpose breed, they are also known as a maternal breed because of their prolificacy, ability to breed aseasonally, early fertility, high milk production, and good mothering. In cross-breeding programs with a meat-type terminal sire offspring exhibit hybrid vigor for traits such as growth rate and carcass quality.

Publicized and endorsed by the Romantic nationalist intellectuals Gheorghe Asachi (who edited the published version) Gheorghe Adamescu, Istoria literaturii rom√¢ne. Literatura istoricƒÉ (\\"The History of Romanian Literature. Historical Literature\\")Lucian Boia, History and Myth in Romanian Consciousness, Central European University Press, Budapest, 2001, p.47-49 and Ion Heliade RƒÉdulescu, it was argued to have been the work of Paharnic Constantin Sion (or another member of his family) or that of Gheorghe SƒÉulescu, Asachi's friend and lifelong collaborator. Content The document claimed to be the version of a text from the 13th century, relying on information first written down by a certain Arbore the Campodux (Campoduxul Arbore) and edited in Medieval Latin by Huru, depicted as chancellor for Moldavia's founder, Prince Drago≈ü (who, the text claimed, had ruled ca. 1270-1280); the final version was claimed to be a transcription of Huru's chronicle through the intervention of SpƒÉtar ClƒÉnƒÉu, a member of Stephen the Great's court (late 15th century). Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, who believed it was \\"the oldest Moldavian chronicle\\", Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, Ioan VodƒÉ cel Cumplit. DupƒÉ el... (27) argued that Stephen the Great had discovered Huru's version in Lviv, at the time part of Jagiellon Poland, \\"while robbing the palace of a Galician magnate\\". The chronicle began by stressing continuity between Roman colonists in the region and the inhabitants of Moldavia: according to the text, in 274, when Emperor Aurelian ordered his troops to retreat from areas north of the Danube, colonists gathered in Ia≈üi and voted to stand their ground and resist migratory intrusions. Consequently, they decided to organize themselves as a federal republic extending from the Carpathians in the west to the Dniester in the east. Impact and character The Chronicle of Huru was published during the last period of Moldavian statehood, three years before the country's union with Wallachia, in the wake of the Crimean War, at a time when the two Danubian Principalities were placed under the common protection of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Second French Empire, Prussia, the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, the Austrian Empire, and the Russian Empire. Following the interest stirred by the apparent breakthrough of the document, Prince Grigore Alexandru Ghica ordered the document to be evaluated by a Commission of experts (comprising Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu, August Treboniu Laurian and Constantin Negruzzi). The latter reported that the chronicle was a forgery, while supporters of the chronicle claimed the original had been lost. According to historiographer Lucian Boia, the forgery was in clear connection to its historical context. The mention of a Dniester border since 274 was meant to emphasize historical rule over Bessarabia, a region since lost to Russia, while mention of republican customs was assigning Moldavia a democratic tradition. Furthermore, Boia argues, authors and supporters of the forgery had proof of Moldavian specificity as their political goal, and generally opposed projects of a union with Wallachia as they were being proposed by Partida Na≈£ionalƒÉ and assessed by the Paris Conference -- Asachi criticized the union, while Sion deemed it \\"a fools' project\\". In addition, the text supposedly written down by ClƒÉnƒÉu in 1495 made use of Romanian, aiming to transport first records of the language back by a few decades (see Neac≈üu's Letter); the analysis of the language used was a main clue in uncovering the forgery. The chronicle, still argued by many to have been authentic, was notably used as a source by Ion Heliade RƒÉdulescu in his Elemente de istoria rom√¢nilor (\\"Elements of Romanian History\\", 1860), and ultimately proven spurious by linguist Alexandru Philippide in 1882.

Geography and geomorphology  Adams is part of a field of about 90 seamounts east-southeast away from Pitcairn Island, and the largest of these. Adams lies southeast of another large seamount, Bounty Seamount. Most of these seamounts except for Adams and Bounty are less than high. They were discovered in 1989 by the RV Sonne research ship. It is a conical seamount rising from the sea floor to about or below the surface of the ocean. The total volume of the seamount, whose base has a diameter of about , is about . Adams has two summits, and coral and sand derived from coral has been found on Adams. Given its height, during the last glacial maximum Adams was likely an island. Its slopes are covered by recent lava flows, volcanic debris and hyaloclastite. Lava flows feature aa lava characteristics and lava tubes, while deeper parts of the edifice are covered with lapilli and scoria. Parasitic vents form cones and mounds on its flanks.  Geology  Adams and the other seamounts were created by the Pitcairn hotspot, and these seamounts are its present-day location. This hotspot is one among several hotspots in the Pacific Ocean, along with the Austral hotspot, Hawaii hotspot, Louisville hotspot, Samoa hotspot and Society hotspot. The seamounts rise from a 30 million years old crust. Alkali basalt, trachyte and tholeiite have been dredged from Adams Seamount.  Eruption history  The fresh appearance of samples and the lack of sedimentation indicates that Adams Seamount is a recently active seamount. Potassium-argon dating of rocks dredged from Adams Seamount has yielded Holocene ages, including one age of 3,000 ¬± 1,000 years before present. Other ages range from 4,000 - 7,000 years before present. Unlike Bounty, Adams Seamount displays no active hydrothermal system.  Biology  Adams seamount features a coral reef, one of the deepest tropical reefs in the world. It is mainly formed by Pocillopora sp. and Porites deformis corals, but also many reef fish and sharks; it is used as a fishing ground by Pitcairn.

Early life Michael Clive \\"Micky\\" Burn, born 11 December 1912 in London, was the eldest of four children. The son of Clive Burn (1882-1955) and Phyllis Burn (n√©e Stoneham) (1883-1968). Burn's father was secretary and solicitor to the Duchy of Cornwall, becoming a trusted confidant of the King. His mother's family was instrumental in developing the golf-and-gambling resort of Le Touquet, the fashionable seaside resort in Hauts-de-France. Initially educated at Winchester College, Burn spent only one year at New College, Oxford before the social seductions of Le Touquet won out. As he himself put it, he was not sent down: having done none of the work expected of him, he simply did not go back, choosing instead to initiate a writing career by ghosting the autobiography of 'Bentley Boy' Sir Henry Birkin. Burn spent time in Florence, befriending Alice Keppel, the former mistress of Edward VII. A bisexual man, his lovers included later Soviet Union spy Guy Burgess. On two occasions during the 1930s Burn took himself to the police to avoid being blackmailed for the crime of homosexual conduct. By his own admission, in earlier life he \\"had been drawn to three autocracies: German National Socialism, Communism, and the Roman Catholic Church.\\" A developing interest in bettering the lot of the socially and economically deprived led Burn to a brief dalliance with National Socialism at a time when Hitler was regarded by many as having cured unemployment and given Germany back her soul. He met the German leader in 1936, who signed his copy of Mein Kampf (lost, shortly thereafter). He also attended a Nazi Party Rally at Nuremberg, standing on the dais just a few feet behind the F√ºhrer himself. An unquestioning tour of Dachau crowned a period of which he later wrote that he was for a time duped by a combination of his own blindness and the \\"intensely organized falsehood\\" that would later be exposed as the engine of the 'New' Germany. In 1936, Burn joined The Times newspaper, initially on probation on the Home Editorial desk. Here he remained until the outbreak of war, with but a brief stint in London as Diplomatic Correspondent. In 1937, with Hitler's intentions becoming ever more clear, Burn enlisted in the Queen's Westminsters, a Territorial battalion of the King's Royal Rifle Corps. Commissioned Second Lieutenant in 1938, he had, by the outbreak of war, wholly abandoned National Socialism as an engine of social change. St. Nazaire Raid When World War II came, Burn was at once called up. Upon their formation in 1939‚Äì40, he volunteered for the independent companies, formed from men willing to undertake exceptional risks. Having served in Norway in 1940, as part of the unsuccessful Allied campaign to counter the German invasion, Burn joined a new elite force known as the Commandos. In March 1942, as a Captain in command of number 6 Troop, No. 2 Commando, he took part in Operation Chariot, the St. Nazaire Raid, his own 6 Troop contributing 29 men to the overall total of 264 Army personnel taking part. As leader of the starboard column of troop carried in several Motor Launches (MLs), Burn's ML192 was one of the first vessels to come under fire, crashing ablaze into the Old Mole. Of his 6 Troop contingent, 14 men were killed. The rest, many of whom were forced to take to the water, were captured early on. Having been hauled ashore by one of his men, and despite being wounded several times, Burn made his way to his target, the only member of his team to succeed in doing so. Burn later attempted to escape the tightening German cordon along with two of his men, one of whom was killed. Burn, along with his remaining companion, was captured and entered a lengthy period of confinement as a \\"guest of the Reich\\". For his actions during the raid Burn received the award of the Military Cross. Of the 609 soldiers and sailors who entered the Loire estuary that fateful night, five were awarded the Victoria Cross ‚Äì the greatest number for any single action during the war. Colditz Following his capture Burn was first sent to Marlag und Milag Nord, a naval POW camp that was the destination of all Charioteers prior to the separation of Commando and Royal Navy personnel. He was then incarcerated in Spangenberg Castle, Oflag IX-A/H, where he began giving lectures to fellow POWs before being sent to Colditz Castle, Oflag IV-C. There, using shorthand learnt for his previous employment in journalism, Burn acted as scribe to Colditz's secret radio operator, Lieutenant-Colonel Jimmy Yule. On liberation, Burn sent dispatches to The Times about what had gone on in Colditz, published in the newspaper on 19 and 21 April 1945. Burn had written a novel during his stay, which was published as Yes, Farewell in 1946. While at Colditz, Burn had received a Red Cross parcel from an old Dutch acquaintance, Ella van Heemstra. After his release from Colditz, Burn responded by sending packages with food and cigarettes to van Heemstra. The food helped the malnourished van Heemstra and her daughter, Audrey Hepburn, survive the hardships following the end of the war. Van Heemstra could also sell the cigarettes for penicillin on the black market to treat the seriously ill Hepburn, perhaps saving her life. Burn ended the war as a Captain. After the Second World War When the war ended Burn returned to The Times. His first assignment‚Äìwhile waiting for a visa to Moscow as permanent correspondent‚Äìwas to Vienna. After several months of waiting in vain for the Moscow visa, he suggested to the editor of The Times that he instead go behind the Iron Curtain to Hungary to observe the government takeover by the Hungarian Communist Party supported by the Red Army. As a consequence, he became the main British reporter on the political purges and the faked trial of Cardinal J√≥zsef Mindszenty. Burn wrote nine books of non-fiction, four novels and six books of poetry. He enjoyed reading his poetry aloud at regional poetry events. He also wrote a play, The Night of the Ball, which opened in London's West End in 1954 starring Gladys Cooper. Private life Burn married Mary Booker (1897-1974) on 27 March 1947; Booker had been divorced from her husband in 1926. The couple moved to North Wales where Bertrand Russell and his last wife, Edith, became first neighbours and then close friends prior to Russell's death in 1970. Following Mary's death in August 1974, Burn discovered her love letters to Richard Hillary, with whom she had been in love from December 1941 until Hillary was killed in January 1943. Burn subsequently wrote his book Mary & Richard (1988) as a commemoration. Burn's autobiography, Turned Towards the Sun, was published in 2003. Death Burn died in his sleep of natural causes after suffering a stroke at his residence in Minffordd, North Wales on 3 September 2010 at age of 97.

It abuts Mount Azuma, a dormant volcano to the north. The peak is called Minowa-yama. It is the highest peak in the Adatara range, which stretches about 9 km in a north- south direction.Takeda T., page 92. The active summit crater is surrounded by hot springs and fumaroles.

Selected cast *Yves Montand as Henri Volney *Michel Etcheverry as Fr√©d√©ric Heiniger *Roger Planchon as Prof. David Naggara *Pierre Vernier as Charly Feruda *Jacques Denis as Despaul *Georges Staquet as Le gardien de l'immeuble d'assassinat Plot The film's plot is based on the Kennedy assassination and subsequent investigation. The film begins with the assassination of President Marc Jarry, who is about to be inaugurated for a second six-year term of office. Henri Volney, state attorney and member of the commission charged with investigating the assassination (based on the Warren Commission) refuses to agree to the commission's final findings. The film portrays the initial controversy about this, as well as Volney and his staff's reopening of the investigation. Fictional state The action takes place in a fictional Western state where the spoken language is mainly French, but German, English and Spanish also are spoken. Its location, or even continent, is unknown. The capital city is made only of modern buildings, like Bras√≠lia. The political regime is presidential, the President being Marc Jarry at the beginning of the film. Location The new town of Cergy in the northwestern suburbs of Paris was used as a filming location for the movie. The EDF-GDF tower designed by architect Renzo Moro is the building from which the shots were fired to assassinate president Marc Jarry. The governor's palace was the prefecture of the Val d'Oise. The huge room used for council meetings is the High Court of Justice. The long scene of the psychological experiment towards the end of the film, supposed to take place at the University of Laye, in fact takes place at ESSEC Business School in Cergy. This fictional Laye University is Yale University and the experiment shown in the film is the famous Milgram experiment, Stanley Milgram being a professor at Yale University. The filmmakers chose the modern and innovative architecture of the new town to avoid depicting any particular country. Accolades The film was awarded the Grand prix du cin√©ma fran√ßais for Best French Movie in 1979. It received five C√©sar Award nominations in 1980, including Best Movie, Best Actor (Yves Montand), Best Screenplay, Best Music and Best Production Design.

It was responsible for formulating the laws and codes for the SS and various other groups of the police, conducting investigations and trials, as well as administering the SS and Police Courts and penal systems.McNab, Chris (2009). The SS: 1923‚Äì1945, p. 37 History Early in the Nazi regime, SS personnel were charged with breaking the law through the performance of their duties at the Dachau concentration camp in 1934. Under such circumstances, the Nazi Party realised it would be expedient to remove the SS and police units from the jurisdiction of the civilian courts. This was achieved with a petition to the Reich Ministry of Justice. This legal status meant all SS personnel were only accountable to the Hauptamt SS Gericht. This effectively placed the SS above German law and able to live by its own rules and conventions.McNab, Chris (2009). The SS: 1923‚Äì1945, p. 41 Organization The SS Court Main Office was an extension of the SS Gericht (SS Court), an organization that administered surveys of the SS and police forces and their codes of honor. The organisation had four departments ():McNab. The SS: 1923‚Äì1945, p. 41 *Amt (Department) I: Legal affairs - SS-Oberf√ºhrer Reinecke *Amt II: Organisation, personnel & disciplinary matters - SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Hinderfield *Amt III: Pardons, reprieves and the execution of sentences - SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Burmeister *Amt IV: Liaison office - SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Krause The SS Court Main Office headquarters were the high court offices in Munich. The organisation had over 600 lawyers that passed sentences on members of the German armed forces and SS, though Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler, would intervene as he saw fit when it came to conviction and the sentencing phase.McNab, Chris (2009). The SS: 1923‚Äì1945, pp. 37, 40, 41 By 1944, the number of the \\"SS Main Offices\\" within Germany had grown from 8 to 12.  SS and Police Courts  The SS Court Main Office administered also 38 regional SS courts throughout Nazi Germany under legal jurisdiction which superseded civilian courts. These laws extended to all SS and police force members operating in Germany or throughout occupied Europe.H√∂hne, Heinz. The Order of the Death's Head, The Story of Hitler's SS. London: Pan Books Ltd The SS and Police Courts were the only authority that could try SS personnel for criminal behaviour. The different SS and Police Courts were as follows: * SS- und Polizeigericht: Standard SS and Police Court for trials of SS officers and enlisted men accused of minor and somewhat serious crimes * Feldgerichte: Waffen-SS Court for court-martials of Waffen-SS personnel accused of violating the military penal code of the German Armed Forces. * Oberstes SS- und Polizeigericht: The Supreme SS and Police Court for trial of serious crimes and also any infraction committed by SS generals. * SS- und Polizeigericht z.b. V.: The Extraordinary SS and Police Court was a secret tribunal that was assembled to deal with highly sensitive issues which were desired to be kept secret even from the SS itself. The one exception to the SS and Police Courts jurisdiction involved members of the SS who were serving on active duty in the Wehrmacht (armed forces). In such cases, the SS member in question was subject to military law and could face charges before a standard military tribunal.McNab. The SS: 1923‚Äì1945, p. 41 Investigations by Judge Georg Konrad Morgen In 1943 SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Georg Konrad Morgen, from the SS Court Main Office, began investigating corruption and criminal activity within the Nazi concentration camps system. He eventually prosecuted so many SS officers that by April 1944, Himmler personally ordered him to restrain his cases. Among the people he investigated was Karl Otto Koch, the commandant of Buchenwald and Majdanek, and husband of Ilse Koch ‚Äî as well as Buchenwald's concentration camp doctor Waldemar Hoven, who was accused of murdering both inmates and camp guards who threatened to testify against Koch. In 1944, while investigating the Auschwitz commander, Rudolf H√∂ss, Morgen's assistant SS-Hauptscharf√ºhrer Gerhard Putsch disappeared. Some theorized this was a warning for Morgen to ease up on his investigations as the building where his files were stored was burned down shortly thereafter. Morgen, who had been an SS judge and investigator, later testified at the Nuremberg trials. He claimed that he fought for justice during the Nazi era and cited his list of 800 investigations into criminal activity at concentration camps during his two years of activity.Toland, John (1976).

It connects the north-central part of Brookings with the northeastern part of it. SD 30 was established in the mid-1950s. It had two segments, which were connected by the end of the decade. However, most of the highway west of what is now Interstate 29 (I-29) was removed the next decade. Route description SD 30 begins at an intersection with County Road 77 (CR 77; 471st Avenue) and the eastern terminus of CR 6 (204th Street) approximately west of White, in the north-central part of Brookings County. SD 30 takes 204th Street to the east-southeast. Just west of 472nd Avenue, it curves to the east-northeast. East of this intersection is an interchange with Interstate 29 (I-29). East of 473rd Avenue, the roadway straightens out to the east. An intersection with CR 25 (478th Avenue) leads to White. It then curves to the northeast, traveling just to the southeast of White. An intersection with 203A Street leads to the eastern part of White, as well as the city park. SD 30 curves to the east-northeast, onto 203rd Street. East of 480th Avenue, the highway curves to the east-southeast. Just east of 481st Street, it resumes its due-east direction. East of 483rd Street, the highway winds its way to the east. Jues west of the southern terminus of CR 29 (485th Avenue), it crosses over Deer Creek. This intersection leads to the Lake Hendricks Lakeside Use Area. East of this intersection, it curves back to the east. Just west of 486th Avenue, it curves to the east-northeast. Just west of CR 35 (487th Avenue), it curves back to the east. Approximately after this intersection, SD 30 meets its eastern terminus, an intersection with the southern terminus of 487B Avenue at the Minnesota state line, northeast of Bushnell. Here, the roadway continues to the east as Minnesota State Highway 19 (MN 19). =National Highway System= No part of SD 30 is included as part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility and defense. History The original SD 30 was established in 1926, and went from the Wyoming border southwest of Lead to the Minnesota border near Elkton. When the U.S. highway system was created in 1926, SD 30 was cosigned with U.S. Route 85 from Wyoming to Sturgis, with U.S. Route 16 from Sturgis to near Philip, and U.S. Route 14 from near Philip to Minnesota. The SD 30 designation was dropped in 1927. The current SD 30 was established in the mid-1950s. At that time, it had two segments. The western segment extended from SD 25, north of De Smet, to U.S. Route 81 (US 81), south of Lake Poinsett. The eastern segment extended from US 77, west of White, to the Minnesota state line. Both segments were connected by 1960. Nearly the entire highway west of US 77, which is now I-29, was decommissioned by 1965.

In seven survey waves to date, SHARE has conducted approximately 380,000 interviews with about 140,000 individuals aged 50 and over. The survey covers 27 European countries and Israel.http://www.share-project.org/organisation/dates-facts.html SHARE was founded as a response to the European Commission's call to \\"examine the possibility of establishing, in co-operation with Member States, a European Longitudinal Ageing Survey\\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?qid=1555587460993&uri;=CELEX:32011D0166. It has since become a major pillar of the European Research Area, selected as one of the projects to be implemented in the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) in 2006 and was given a new legal status as the first ever European Research Infrastructure Consortium (SHARE-ERIC) in March 2011.http://ec.europa.eu/research/infrastructures/?pg=eric- landscapehttp://www.share-project.org/organisation/share-eric.html  About SHARE  Founded in 2002, SHARE is coordinated centrally at the Munich Center for the Economics of Aging (MEA), Max-Planck-Institute for Social Law and Social Policy and led by Managing Director Axel B√∂rsch-Supan. It is a collaborative effort of more than 150 researchers worldwide who are organized in multidisciplinary national teams and cross-national working groups. A Scientific Monitoring Board composed of eminent international researchers and a network of advisors help to maintain and improve the project‚Äôs high scientific standards. SHARE is harmonized with its role models and sister studies the U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), and has the advantage of encompassing cross-national variation in public policy, culture and history across a variety of European countries. Its scientific power is based on its panel design that grasps the dynamic character of the ageing process. SHARE‚Äôs multi- disciplinary approach delivers a full picture of the ageing process. Procedural guidelines and programs ensure an ex-ante harmonized cross-national design. The collected data include health variables (e.g. self-reported health, health conditions, physical and cognitive functioning, health behaviour, use of health care facilities), biomarkers (e.g. grip strength, body-mass index, peak flow), psychological variables (e.g. psychological health, well-being, life satisfaction), economic variables (current work activity, job characteristics, opportunities to work past retirement age, sources and composition of current income, wealth and consumption, housing, education), and social support variables (e.g. assistance within families, transfers of incomes and assets, social networks, volunteer activities). SHARE data collection is based on computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) complemented by measurements as well as paper-and-pencil questionnaires. The data are available to the entire research community free of charge. = Funding = SHARE receives funding from the European Commission, the American National Institute on Aging and national sources, especially the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.  Summary results = Economic Situation, Income and Retirement = The data collected by SHARE provide a detailed insight into the financial situation of households of elderly Europeans. Among other things, the study shows that not in all European countries incomes are sufficient ‚Äì therefore, poverty in old age is a serious problem in some countries. Income is considered the least sufficient in the Eastern European countries Poland and Czech Republic, in the Southern European countries Greece, Italy, and Spain as well as Israel. In these countries, more than 50 percent of households report difficulties making ends meet with their income. In contrast, income is considered satisfactory especially in Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Switzerland; there, less than 20 percent of households have problems getting by with their income. Likewise, patterns of employment and retirement differ significantly between the European countries. The proportion of people with high workloads in the low wage sector is particularly high in Poland and Greece. Accordingly, the proportion of early retirees is above average. In contrast, work quality in regard to the balance between performance and wage is high in the Nordic countries, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. These countries also show the lowest percentage of older employees opting for early retirement. = Family = Availability of kin support largely depends in general on geographic accessibility and social contact. The SHARE data confirm, on the one hand, the existence of longstanding regional patterns of ‚Äòweak‚Äô and ‚Äòstrong‚Äô family ties, while, on the other hand, they reveal many similarities across Europe. In all countries ‚Äì and across all age groups ‚Äì 85 percent of all parents have at least one child living at a distance of at most 25 km. Moreover, the share of parents with less than weekly contacts to a child is equally low (7%) in Sweden and in Spain.http://www.share- project.org/fileadmin/SHARE_Brochure/share_broschuere_web_final.pdf These results provide no evidence to support the notion of a ‚Äòdecline‚Äô of parent- child relations in ageing Europe at the beginning of the 21st century. = Health = SHARE data document a strong relationship between education and health among the older population. This holds not only on the individual level (better educated individuals are healthier than less educated) but also across European nations. Comparing average education and average health levels in SHARE countries reveals that in particular the East European and Mediterranean countries are characterized by low levels of education and health simultaneously. In contrast, populations in Northern European countries and Switzerland are both healthier and better educated than the average.http://www.share- project.org/fileadmin/SHARE_Brochure/share_broschuere_web_final.pdf  Research with SHARE data  As of July 2019, about 10,000 researchers worldwide use SHARE data for their research.http://www.share- project.org/share-publications/user-publications-statistics.html Publications based on SHARE data are documented and published online.http://www.share- project.org/share-publications.html  Waves of data collection  Countries participating in Wave 7 of the SHARE study By now, seven waves of data collection have been conducted. Further waves are being planned to take place on a biennial basis. = Wave 1 (2004) = Eleven European countries have contributed data to the 2004 SHARE baseline study. They constitute a balanced representation of the various regions in Europe, ranging from Scandinavia (Denmark and Sweden) through Central Europe (Austria, France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, and the Netherlands) to the Mediterranean (Spain, Italy and Greece). Israel joined the SHARE framework in late 2004, being the first country in the Middle East to initiate a systematic study of its aging population. The SHARE main questionnaire consisted of 20 modules on health, socio-economics and social networks.http://www.share-project.org/data- documentation/questionnaires/questionnaire-wave-1.html All data were collected by face-to-face, computer-aided personal interviews (CAPI), supplemented by a self-completion paper and pencil questionnaire.http://www.share- project.org/data-documentation/waves-overview/wave-1.html = Wave 2 (2006-07) = Two 'new' EU member states - the Czech Republic and Poland - as well as Ireland joined SHARE in 2006 and participated in the second wave of data collection in 2006-07. In addition to the main questionnaire an ‚ÄòEnd of Life‚Äô interview was conducted for family members of deceased respondents.http://www.share-project.org/data- documentation/questionnaires/questionnaire-wave-2.html Israel carried out its second wave in 2009-10.http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/waves- overview/wave-2.html = Wave 3 / SHARELIFE (2008-09) = SHARELIFE is the third wave of data collection for SHARE, which focuses on people's life histories. 30,000 men and women across 13 European countries took part in this round of the survey. SHARELIFE links individual micro data over the respondents‚Äô entire life with institutional macro data on the welfare state. It thereby allows assessing the full effect of welfare state interventions on the life of the individual. Changes in institutional settings that influence individual decisions are of specific interest to evaluate policies throughout Europe. The SHARELIFE questionnaire contains all important areas of the respondents‚Äô lives, ranging from partners and children over housing and work history to detailed questions on health and health care.http://www.share- project.org/data-documentation/questionnaires/questionnaire- wave-3-sharelife.html With this variety SHARELIFE constitutes a large interdisciplinary dataset for research in the fields of sociology, economics, gerontology, and demography. The SHARELIFE life history data can be linked to the first two waves of SHARE assessing the present living conditions of older Europeans.http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/waves- overview/wave-3-sharelife.html SHARELIFE was repeated in Wave 7, collecting life-history information from those respondents who had not done a life- history interview in Wave 3. = Wave 4 (2010-11) = In the fourth wave, which started in autumn 2010, Estonia, Hungary, Luxemburg, Portugal and Slovenia joined the SHARE survey. In the other European countries the national samples were enlarged, and a new social network module was added to the main questionnaire.http://www.share-project.org/data- documentation/questionnaires/questionnaire-wave-4.html In the German study, three additional projects including innovative biomarkers (e.g. dried bloodspots), the linkage with the German pension data as well as nonresponse experiments were implemented.http://www.share-project.org/data- documentation/waves-overview/wave-4.html = Wave 5 (2013) = Data collection for Wave 5 took place in 2013. A total of 15 countries participated in this wave, including, for the first time, Luxemburg. Since March 2015 the data is available for research purposes. Wave 5 included additional questions regarding childhood, material deprivation, social exclusion, and migration, as well as information on computer skills and the use of computers at the workplace.http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/waves- overview/wave-5.html = Wave 6 (2015) = Wave 6 was conducted in 2015 in 17 countries. One of the most important innovations was the collection of objective health measures by means of ‚ÄúDried Blood Spot Sampling‚Äù (DBSS): In 12 countries, a blood samples were collected in order to determine blood levels which are associated with diseases that primarily occur among older people. These include cardiovascular diseases and diseases that can be triggered by external living conditions and environmental factors, such as diabetes mellitus (type 2). These additional biomarkers are expected to be a useful instrument for comparing the objective health status with the subjective perception of the respondents. Moreover, they should help to explain correlations between health and social status and to demonstrate the course of a disease. Wave 6 furthermore captures longitudinal changes in the social networks.http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/waves- overview/wave-6.html = Wave 7 (2017) = In 2017, the main data collection of Wave 7 took place in 28 countries - full coverage of the EU was achieved by including 8 new countries in SHARE: Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Malta and Cyprus. All respondents who had already taken part in the third wave of SHARE (SHARELIFE) were interviewed about their current situation in terms of family, friends, health as well as social and financial circumstances. For those who had not taken part in SHARELIFE, the Wave 7 questionnaire contained a SHARELIFE module to collect information on their life histories. Wave 7 data was released in April 2019. http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/waves-overview/wave-7.html  Related studies and projects  The SHARE-Study is not the only study engaging in these fields of research - it has a number of sister studies all over the world dealing with these subjects like ageing, pensions, retirement and population aging in general. Analogue studies following the SHARE model are for instance The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), The Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI), The Japanese Study of Aging and Retirement (JSTAR), SHARE Israel, The Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA), Chinese Health and Retirement Survey (CHARLS) and Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS).

It was founded in January 2006 by former Funimation executives Stephanie Giotes, Richard Ray, and Barry Watson. Illumitoon's goal was to have its shows aired on television and offer unedited dual language DVDs. History Illumitoon shared facilities with CRM Productions in Fort Worth, Texas and Westlake Entertainment was used for distribution. The company's first anime license was Beet the Vandel Buster and Beet the Vandel Buster Excellion. They also licensed AM Driver, B't X, and BT'X Neo. Illumitoon joined with Westlake for the licensing of Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo. Several Illumitoon releases had production issues including music being changed, the use of dubtitles (subtitles created from the dub script), and inoperable discs. Replacements with translated subtitles were offered for the first DVDs of Beet, Bobo, and B't X that were later found to be DVD-Rs. AM Driver and B't X were licensed by The Anime Network for VOD, but only 14 episodes of each series had a complete dub. After Westlake ceased distribution of their titles, future releases from Illumitoon were cancelled in late 2007. Post Illumitoon AM Driver was never released on DVD and all series remained incomplete until S'more Entertainment relicensed Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo. This release also experienced issues due to the lack of subtitles. B't X was relicensed in 2016 by Anime Midstream.

The name is from an Aboriginal Australian word meaning \\"the hunted one\\". Two manually-controlled prototypes, were built as the GAF Pika (Project CFlight 1952) as a proof of concept to test the aerodynamics, engine and radio control systems, serialled A92-1/2, 'B-1/2'. The radio-controlled Jindivik was initially designated the Project B and received serials in the A93 series. Pika is an Aboriginal Australian word meaning flier.Bridgman, Leonard, compiler and editor, \\"Jane's All The World's Aircraft 1952‚Äì53\\", McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc., New York, 1952, pages 91‚Äì92. Design and development The Jindivik was developed as a result of a bilateral agreement between Australia and the UK regarding guided missile testing. While the UK provided the missiles, Australia provided test facilities, such as the Woomera Test Range. As a result of the talks, Australia gained the contract for developing a target drone to Ministry of Supply specification E.7/48.Flight Jindivik in theory and practice The specification called for an aircraft capable of a 15-minute sortie at .

GAF Pika displayed at the RAAF Museum at Point Cook, Victoria in 1988 The manually piloted prototype, known as the Pika, had side air intakes (to make room for the cockpit) and retractable undercarriage operated from a pneumatic reservoir.Flight 1952 p. 512 The remotely-piloted version, the Jindivik, followed the same basic form except that it had a single skid instead of an undercarriage and a dorsal air intake located where the Pika's cockpit was. The Jindivik Mk.1 was powered by an Armstrong Siddeley Adder (ASA.1) turbojet, which had been developed as a disposable engine for the project. Only 14 Mk.1s were ever made. The Mk.2 was powered by a Flight 1956 Armstrong Siddeley Viper engine. The Viper was also intended for a short lifespan ‚Äì about 10 hours, but a \\"long life\\" version was also produced for conventional aircraft. A Jindivik 102B after assembly by Fairey Aviation at Manchester for use on the UK test range at Aberporth The control systems were manufactured by various firms including Elliott Brothers, GEC and McMichael, with assistance from the Royal Aircraft Establishment.Flight 17 February 1961 p. 211 Control was maintained through an autopilot that received radio commands from the ground, rather than direct flight by a ground controller. Eighteen commands could be issued to the autopilot with six further commands for the operation of other onboard equipment. The drone was launched via a self-steering trolley. At , the drone was designed to apply its flaps, push the elevators up and release the trolley. Landing was made at . Two controllers (azimuth and elevation) were used to align the drone on the runway. On landing it touched down on its skid and banking would cause the wingtip \\"shoes\\" to touch the runway, which controlled its path down the runway as it slowed. Between 1952 and 1986, a total of 502 aircraft were produced. Examples for use in the United Kingdom were shipped by surface transport, and assembled and tested by Fairey Aviation at Hayes, Middlesex, and Manchester Airport. In 1997, the production line was re-opened to build another 15 for Britain.The Bulletin: Bird of Prey Operators Since production began, the Jindivik has been used by the Royal Australian Air Force, the Royal Australian Navy's Fleet Air Arm, and the Royal Air Force. The last Australian Jindiviks were taken out of service in the late 1990s and were replaced by the Kalkara. Most UK tests were conducted by the Royal Aircraft Establishment at their Llanbedr establishment and fired over the nearby Aberporth Airport test range in west Wales.Taylor, H.A., Fairey Aircraft since 1915, 1974, Putnam & Company Limited, In the UK, the drone was used in the development of the Bristol Bloodhound, English Electric Thunderbird, and Seaslug surface-to-air missiles, and the de Havilland Firestreak air-to-air missile.

She is credited as the first woman to publish stories under her own name in science fiction magazines. Her stories often dealt with characters on the \\"borders of humanity\\" such as cyborgs. Harris began publishing magazine stories in 1926, and soon became well liked by readers. She sold a total of eleven stories, which were collected in 1947 as Away From the Here and Now. Her gender was a surprise to Hugo Gernsback, the editor who first bought her work, as she was the first American woman to publish science fiction stories under her own name. Her stories, which often feature strong female characters, have been occasionally reprinted and have received some positive critical response, including a recognition of her pioneering role as a woman writer in a male- dominated field.  Life  Clare Winger was born on January 18, 1891, in Freeport, IllinoisSocial Security Death Record for Clare Winger Harris, SS# 550-34-7527, accessed April 2, 2007. and later attended Smith College in Massachusetts. Her father, Frank Stover Winger, was an electrical engineer who also had an interest in science-fiction writing; in 1917, he published a novel called The Wizard of the Island; or, The Vindication of Prof. Waldinger. Her mother, May Stover, was the daughter of D.C. Stover, founder of the Stover Manufacturing and Engine Company. (Frank was also related to the Stover family on his mother's side, hence his middle name.) Unusually for the era, after their children were born and raised, Frank and May divorced. In 1912, Clare married Frank Clyde Harris. Her husband was an architect and engineer who served in World War I and was chief engineer with the Loudon Machinery Company in Iowa and one of the organizers of the American Monorail Company of Cleveland, Ohio.James Harris-Mary Cherry Family, PART 3, POSTERITY CHAPTER VI, Isaiah M. Harris-Wilkerson-Murrell Descendants, accessed April 2, 2007. Harris gave birth to three sons (Clyde Winger, born 1915; Donald Stover, born 1916; and Lynn Thackrey, born 1918). She and her family lived in Iowa in 1925 according to a state census; sometime before 1930, the family moved to Lakewood, Ohio. Her career as a writer spanned the years 1923 to 1933, during her tenures in both these locations. Harris ceased writing stories after 1933. She was still living in Lakewood in 1935, and according to an interview with her grandson, she and Frank \\"stayed together until their kids were fully grown.\\"https://lithub.com/meet-the-reclusive-woman-who-became-a-pioneer-of- science-fiction/ Clare and Frank's youngest son turned 18 in 1936, and by 1940, U.S. census records show Clare W. Harris as divorced and living in Pasadena, California, where she lived the rest of her life. She privately published a collection of her stories in 1947, but otherwise little is known of the final decades of her life. She died on October 26, 1968, in Pasadena.  Writing career  Harris debuted as a writer in 1923 with a novel, a piece of historical fiction entitled Persephone of Eleusis: A Romance of Ancient Greece. The rest of her work would be very different, as it consisted entirely of short stories in the realm of science fiction. Harris published her first short story, \\"The Runaway World,\\" in the July 1926 issue of Weird Tales. In December of that year, she submitted a story for a contest being run by Amazing Stories editor Hugo Gernsback. Harris's story, \\"The Fate of the Poseidonia\\" (a space opera about Martians who steal earth's water), placed third. She soon became one of Gernsback's most popular writers. Harris eventually published 11 short stories in pulp magazines, most of them in Amazing Stories (although she also published in other places such as Science Wonder Quarterly). She wrote her most acclaimed works during the 1920s; in 1930, she stopped writing to raise and educate her children. Her absence from the pulps was noted‚Äîa fan wrote in to Amazing Stories in late 1930 to ask, ‚ÄúWhat happened to Clare Winger Harris? I‚Äôve missed her . . .‚Äù However, she did publish one story in 1933‚Äîtitled \\"The Vibrometer,\\" it appeared in a mimeographed pamphlet called Science Fiction. The editors, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, were high school students in Cleveland at the time. In 1947, all of Harris's short stories except \\"The Vibrometer\\" were collected under the title Away from the Here and Now; a 2019 collection, The Artificial Man and Other Stories, also includes \\"The Vibrometer.\\" Her stories have also been reprinted in anthologies such as Daughters of Earth: Feminist Science Fiction in the 20th Century (with a critical essay), Sci-Fi Womanthology, Amazing Science Fiction Anthology: The Wonder Years 1926-1935, and Gosh Wow! Sense of Wonder Science Fiction. Harris also wrote one of the first attempts to classify science fiction when, in the August 1931 issue of Wonder Stories, she listed 16 basic science fiction themes, including \\"interplanetary space travel,\\" \\"adventures on other worlds,\\" and \\"the creation of synthetic life.\\"Letter/essay from Clare Winger Harris, Wonder Stories, August 1931. An excerpt of this letter is reprinted on Google Groups here, accessed March 30, 2007.  Critical view and influence  When Gernsback published Harris's first short story in Amazing Stories, he praised her writing while also expressing amazement that a woman could write good science fiction: \\"That the third prize winner should prove to be a woman was one of the surprises of the contest, for, as a rule, women do not make good scientifiction writers, because their education and general tendencies on scientific matters are usually limited. But the exception, as usual, proves the rule, the exception in this case being extraordinarily impressive.\\" For many years Harris claimed to have been the first woman science-fiction writer in the United States, although later research proved this to be untrue, as Gertrude Barrows Bennett, writing under the pseudonym Francis Stevens, was publishing science fiction stories as early as 1917. Note that the true identity of \\"Francis Stevens\\" was not known publicly until 1952, long after the writing careers of both Harris and Bennett were over. More recently, Harris is often credited with the narrower distinction of being the first American woman to publish stories in science fiction magazines under her own name. Nevertheless, this must be qualified as well: as a teenager, Bennett, born Gertrude Mabel Barrows, published one story as G.M. Barrows (i.e., her own name) in a 1904 edition of Argosy magazine. Argosy, however, was not strictly speaking a science fiction magazine, as it ran stories from a number of genres. Even though Harris published only a handful of stories, almost all of them have been reprinted over the years. Of these, \\"The Miracle of the Lily\\" has been reprinted the most and praised by many critics, with Richard Lupoff saying the story would have \\"won the Hugo Award for best short story, if the award had existed then.\\" Lupoff also wrote that \\"[w]hile today's reader may find her prose creaky and old-fashioned, the stories positively teem with still-fresh and provocative ideas.\\"Curiosities, F&SF;, July 1998 \\"The Fate of the Poseidonia\\" has also been reprinted a number of times and is credited as an early example of a science fiction story with a heroic female lead character. Other of Harris's stories are also noted for featuring strong female characters, such as Sylvia, the airplane pilot and mechanic in \\"The Ape Cycle\\" (1930). Harris also wrote one story utilizing a female point of view (in 1928's \\"The Fifth Dimension\\"). Because Harris was the first American woman published in science fiction magazines under her own name, and because of her embrace of female characters and themes, she has been recognized in recent years as a pioneer of women's and feminist science fiction. Her work was featured at the Pasadena History Museum in 2018, as part of an exhibit titled \\"Dreaming the Universe: The Intersection of Science, Fiction, & Southern California.\\" Bibliography=Novels= * Persephone of Eleusis: A Romance of Ancient Greece (1923) =Collections= * Away from the Here and Now: Stories in Pseudo-Science (Philadelphia: Dorrance, 1947) *The Artificial Man and Other Stories (Belt Publishing, February 2019) =Short stories= (Stories included in Away from the Here and Now). * \\"A Runaway World\\" (Weird Tales, July 1926) * \\"The Fate of the Poseidonia\\" (Amazing Stories, June 1927) * \\"A Certain Soldier\\" (Weird Tales, November 1927) * \\"The Fifth Dimension\\" (Amazing Stories, December 1928) * \\"The Menace From Mars\\" (Amazing Stories, October 1928) * \\"The Miracle of the Lily\\" (Amazing Stories, April 1928) * \\"The Artificial Man\\" (Science Wonder Quarterly, Fall 1929) * \\"A Baby on Neptune\\" with Miles J.

The primary types of subdivision are administrative regions, regional county municipalities (RCMs), metropolitan communities (CMs), the Kativik Regional Government (KRG), unorganized territories (TNOs), agglomerations, northern villages, Cree villages, Naskapi villages, and a variety of local units which may collectively be referred to as local municipalities and boroughs. English names In English versions of provincial statutes, English names are used for the generic names of government bodies and administrative subdivisions and French ones in proper names, except when the body itself is bilingual. In such cases the existence of an official English name is usually the result of a specific legal provision to that effect. For example, official nomenclature is \\"ten regional county municipalities\\", but \\"An Act respecting the Municipalit√© r√©gionale de comt√© du Bas-Richelieu\\". On the other hand, \\"Kativik Regional Government\\" is used in English because the legislation that created it specifically provides for English and Inuktitut names alongside the French one. The use of acronyms is divided, however, as the acronyms corresponding to the English generic terms are not always in use. Thus one writes \\"ten RCMs\\", \\"the MRC du Bas- Richelieu\\", \\"five regional conferences of elected officers\\" and \\"five CREs\\". Regional level The seventeen administrative regions of Quebec. The highest level of organization is the administrative region (r√©gion administrative). Quebec has 17 administrative regions. They have no government of their own, but rather serve primarily to organize the provision of provincial government services, most significantly the allocation of regional economic development funding. Supralocal level Local municipalities are organized into three kinds of supralocal units: regional county municipalities or RCMs (municipalit√©s r√©gionales de comt√©, MRC), metropolitan communities or CMs (\\"communaut√©s m√©tropolitaines\\") and regional government (administration r√©gionale). Most municipalities belong to an RCM. However, some municipalities, mostly urban, northern or Aboriginal, do not. While CMs may overlap with various administrative regions, RCMs are each wholly contained within a single region, as is the sole regional government, the Kativik Regional Government. RCMs and CMs may also overlap. In addition to local municipalities, unorganized territories or TNOs (territoires non organis√©s) may also fall under the jurisdiction of an RCM or of the Kativik Regional Government. Although they are not municipalities, TNOs will be considered \\"local municipal units\\" for the purposes of the discussion below. =Local municipalities not belonging to an RCM= There are 47 non-Aboriginal local municipalities in Quebec which do not belong to an RCM, of which the majority are cities or suburbs of cities. These include 21 of the 82 local municipalities making up the Communaut√© m√©tropolitaine de Montr√©al and 4 of the 28 municipalities of the Communaut√© m√©tropolitaine de Qu√©bec. In particular, Montreal and Quebec City themselves do not belong to any RCM. The 29 local municipal units of various descriptions (see below) under the jurisdiction of the Kativik Regional Government do not belong to any RCM. Their total population in 2001 was 10,420. There are a further 47 Aboriginal local municipal units (30 Indian reserves, 8 Cree villages, 8 lands reserved for the Cree and 1 land reserved for the Naskapi, with a total population in 2001 of 48,082) which do not fall under the jurisdiction of an RCM. Indian reserves differ from Cree, Naskapi and northern villages in the relatively greater role played in the former by the federal government, as opposed to the provincial one, in many areas ordinarily of provincial jurisdiction such as education, health and local government organization. =Regional county municipalities= In all, Quebec has some 86 regional county municipalities or RCMs. RCMs deal with issues requiring coordination between neighbouring local municipalities such as waste management and public transportation. Powers RCMs have responsibility for a number of issues of local interest, including territorial planning, realty assessment for property taxes, waste management, emergency planning, local economic development and employment assistance as well as local financing of the local development centre or CLD (centre local de d√©veloppement). Government The powers of the RCM are exercised by the RCM council (conseil de MRC). It is composed of the mayors of each of the member municipalities and possibly other elected municipal officials as well as a warden (pr√©fet). Depending on the RCM, a warden can either be appointed by the council (in which case the warden must be one of the mayors) or elected by universal suffrage (in which case they cannot hold any other elective office). The voting strength of each municipality on the council is determined in part by its population, but a formula is used to prevent a small number of large municipalities from making decisions unilaterally. =Metropolitan communities= There are two metropolitan communities or CMs in Quebec, the Communaut√© m√©tropolitaine de Montr√©al or CMM and the Communaut√© m√©tropolitaine de Qu√©bec or CMQ. CMs have responsibility for areas of common interest to their constituent municipalities such as urban planning, economic development, promotion of international trade, artistic and cultural development, public transportation and waste management. Each CM also has specific areas of jurisdiction defined by the legislation governing it. Communaut√© m√©tropolitaine de Montr√©al The CMM comprises 82 local municipalities in all, of which 21 do not belong to any RCM, including Montreal itself. The CMM further encompasses the entire territory of four RCMs and parts of another six RCMs. Communaut√© m√©tropolitaine de Qu√©bec The CMQ consists of some 28 local municipalities, of which four do not belong to an RCM, including Quebec City itself. The CMQ also covers all of MRC de L'√éle-d'Orleans and parts of La C√¥te-de-Beaupr√© and La Jacques-Cartier RCMs. =Kativik Regional Government= The Kativik Regional Government or KRG (Administration r√©gionale Kativik), located in the Nord-du-Qu√©bec region, serves a primarily Inuit population. In addition to the usual functions of RCMs, the KRG exercises powers devolved to the Inuit of Quebec in recognition of their right to self-government. These include, among other things, jurisdiction over police, transportation, communications and labour. The KRG is composed of 14 northern villages or VNs (\\"villages nordiques\\"), 12 \\"Category I lands for the Inuit\\" or TIs (terres de la cat√©gorie I pour les Inuit), one Naskapi village or VK (village naskapi) and two unorganized territories or TNOs (\\"territoires non-organis√©s\\"). PowersGovernmentLocal level The primary level of local organization is the \\"local municipality\\" or municipalit√© locale, although this term groups together numerous more specific legal designations such as ville (\\"city\\" or \\"town\\"), municipalit√© (\\"municipality\\"), village (\\"village\\"), paroisse (\\"parish\\"), canton (\\"township\\") and, strictly speaking incorrectly, village nordique (\\"northern village\\"), village cri (\\"Cree village\\") or village naskapi (\\"Naskapi village\\"). Local municipalities have authority over most local government matters. Some areas are not part of any local municipality. These are known as unorganized territories or TNOs (territoires non- organis√©s). Municipal authority in TNOs is exercised directly by the MRC to which they belong (or the KRG, as the case may be). In addition to local municipalities, there are two other kinds of administrative entity at the local level which are not general features of municipal organization in Quebec, but which occur in a limited number of areas, especially urban ones, and retain some features of previous states of municipal organization in those areas. These are the borough (or arrondissement), which is submunicipal, and the agglomeration (agglom√©ration), which may group together a number of local municipalities. =Local municipalities= There are 1,117 local municipalities in Quebec. This figure is excluding northern villages (VN), Cree villages (VC) and the Naskapi village (VK), as well as their associated reserved lands (TI, TC and TK). Local municipalities are governed primarily by the Towns and Cities Act and the Municipal Code of Qu√©bec, while northern villages are governed by the Act respecting Northern villages and the Kativik Regional Government and Cree and Naskapi villages are governed by the Cree Villages and the Naskapi Village Act and hence are not technically referred to as \\"local municipalities\\". However, all of these may be referred to as local municipal units. PowersGovernment=Agglomerations= At the beginning of the 2000s, the Quebec government carried out a program of municipal mergers, hoping thereby to achieve economies of scale in municipal expenditures and greater fiscal equity. As a result, cities such as Montreal, Quebec, Hull and Chicoutimi absorbed neighbouring municipalities in 2002 (occasionally changing their names in the process, as Hull and Chicoutimi did). After a change of provincial government, it was decided to hold \\"demerger\\" referendums in the former municipalities which had merged, and some of these decided to reclaim their status as municipalities. These municipalities were reconstituted in 2006. However, many features of the organization of the original merged cities were retained, including shared fiscal responsibility for a number of matters that would ordinarily be handled at the municipal level. Hence when the new, merged cities were turned into \\"agglomerations\\" (agglom√©rations), the reconstituted municipalities recovered only part of their autonomy. Most notably, the entire Island of Montreal forms a single agglomeration. The respective powers of agglomerations and reconstituted municipalities are defined by the Act respecting the consultation of citizens with respect to the territorial reorganization of certain municipalities and subsequent legislation. The Act respecting the exercise of certain municipal powers in certain urban agglomerations defines the expression urban agglomeration as follows: an urban agglomeration corresponds to the territory, as it exists on 17 December 2004, of Ville de Montr√©al, Ville de Qu√©bec, Ville de Longueuil, Ville de Mont-Laurier, Ville de La Tuque, Municipalit√© des √éles-de-la-Madeleine, Ville de Sainte-Agathe-des- Monts, Ville de Mont-Tremblant, Ville de Cookshire-Eaton, Ville de Rivi√®re- Rouge or Ville de Sainte-Marguerite-Est√©rel. Powers of the agglomeration Agglomeration powers (comp√©tences d'agglom√©ration) are exercised by an agglomeration council (conseil d'agglom√©ration). These powers are listed on the minist√®re des Affaires municipales et r√©gionales website. The City of Montreal website lists the following areas of jurisdiction for the agglomeration council (some of these are RCM powers that would not be exercised by most agglomerations):Ville de Montr√©al - La Mairie - Agglomeration council * realty assessment * security services, notably police, fire protection and 9-1-1 * municipal court * social housing * help for the homeless * waste management plan, including disposal and reclamation of waste materials and hazardous waste management * water supply and sewage treatment, except for local network * public transit * management of streets and the major arteries * economic promotion, including tourism, outside of the territory of a linked municipality * nature parks Powers of the reconstituted municipality The functions of a reconstituted municipality vary by agglomeration and by municipality, but generally relate to what are called comp√©tences de proximit√©, known as \\"local powers\\" in English. The Minist√®re des affaires municipales et r√©gionales website lists some of these. Government The jurisdiction of the agglomeration is exercised by the agglomeration council, composed of representatives of all of its constituent municipalities. Their number is determined in accordance with the populations of their respective municipalities. =Boroughs= A few local municipalities are divided into boroughs (arrondissements). Some municipal functions are delegated to borough councils (conseils d'arrondissement) if it is deemed desirable for these functions to be administered more locally. The powers of the borough council vary from municipality to municipality and even from borough to borough within a single municipality and are often guaranteed by provincial statute. Currently, eight local municipalities in Quebec are divided into boroughs. These are Montreal, Quebec City, Longueuil, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, L√©vis, M√©tis-sur-Mer and Grenville-sur-la-Rouge. In many cases, boroughs correspond to municipalities that existed before amalgamation in 2002.

In Arabic the council is known as Sahawa Al Anbar (Arabic: ÿµÿ≠Ÿàÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸÜÿ®ÿßÿ±), abbreviated SAA when referred to by the US Army. The council has become a model for awakening movements across Iraq, though the Iraqi Defense Ministry has said that it plans to disband the Awakening groups due to concerns about their origins and future intent. History Shortly after the invasion in 2003, Sunni tribal leaders and former Ba'athists, led by members of the Al-Kharbit (Khalifa) and Al-Gaoud (Nimr) families met to select former Ba'ath General Karim Burjis as their unofficial leader and new Governor of Anbar Province. Burjis was later recognized by the coalition, and remained in office until 2004, when he was forced to resign by AQI as a condition to their release of kidnapped family members. This meeting 2003 was the first attempt by Sunni tribal and nationalist leaders to self-organize and re-establish order in Al Anbar. Many of those who participated in this initial meeting fled the country for the safety of the growing ex-pat community in Amman, Jordan to include the paramount sheikhs of the Khalifa and Alwani. In 2005, tribal leaders again attempted to form a counter-AQI body, and organized the Anbar People's Committee. This should not be confused with the Anbar Peoples Congress - a coalition of tribal leaders residing in Amman, Jordan. The Anbar People's Committee was headed by the paramount sheikh of the Albu Fahad - Sheikh Walid Abd al Karim Mukhlif Fahadawi. He was kidnapped from his home by AQI terrorists dressed as Iraqi Police and murdered. After his murder, and the murder of several other APC leaders by AQI, the APC disbanded. This was the second official attempt at organizing an indigenous anit-AQI movement. After the murder of Sheikh Walid Fahadawi, an anti-AQI vigilante group known as Thwar-al-Anbar (the Anbar Revolutionaries) was formed by individuals across Anbar to include Hameed al-Haiys Thiyabi, Muhammad al-Haiys Thiyabi, Jabar Fteykhan Rishawi, Aifan Sadoon Issawi, Jassim Muhammad Suwaydawi, as well as others from the Albu Fahad and Albu Bali tribes. The group's core members most likely never exceeded 30 members, yet had a disproportionately high impact in the fight against AQI, and the birth of the Awakening. TAA conducted their own murder and intimidation campaign in an attempt to out-terrorize the terrorists. Their operations resulting in the killing of numerous AQI emirs, and further reinforced the growing hostility toward AQI in Ramadi and Fallujah. TAA never officially disbanded, and those who survived their anti- AQI campaign served as the nucleus of what was to become the Awakening - Sahwah al-Anbar (SAA). In August 2006, members of AQI operating in Al Ramadi, murdered a prominent member of the Albu Ali Jassim tribe, decapitated his dead body, and refused to allow the body to be returned per Muslim custom for burial within the traditional 3-day period. Following this incident, members of AQI next threatened to murder women affiliated with the Albu Ali Jassim in Ramadi. In response to the threat and murder of a prominent member, leaders within the Albu Ali Jassim, to include the murdered man's sons, sought assistance from other Anbar tribal leaders to include former members of TAA‚ÄîHameed al Haiys, Jassim Suwaydawi, and Jabar Rishawi‚Äîyounger brother of Sheikh Abu Sattar Albu Risha. This is generally considered the beginning of SAA and the \\"Awakening.\\" commonly considered the last straw and the spark that created the Al Anbar Salvation Council. To counter AQI, Sheikh Sattar, a former insurgent leader affiliated with the Numan Brigade in Ramadi, officially organized SAA‚Äîwhich included in its leadership Hameed al Haiys, Jassim Suwaydawi, Wissam Hardan Al Aithawi, Sheikh Ali Hatim al Sulayman, Abdullah Jallal al Faraji, Waleed Albu Ali Jassim, and Aifan Sadoon al Issawi. Sattar had himself been victimized by AQI‚Äîwith his brother and father murdered. While Wissam Hardan, Ali Hatem, and Aifan Sadoon all represented elite families within the tribes of Anbar, the majority of individuals within the SAA leadership were from families considered second and third-tier within their tribal hierarchy. This would create significant problems for coalition forces in Al Anbar who were faced with the decision of supporting the traditional tribal elite (most of which had fled to Amman, Jordan during the worst AQI violence) upon their return, or the \\"new\\" leadership represented by those affiliated with SAA. In November 2006, a force of approximately 70 AQI fighters attacked the compound of Jassim Suwaydawi. Aided by coalition forces, Jassim's small force of 17 family members held-off the attacking force, killing and wounding the vast majority. This is commonly referred to as the Battle of Sofia, and marks another turning point in the power of AQI over the tribes of Al Anbar. As retribution for his defiance, Jassim's sister was abducted by members of AQI, and murdered by being dragged behind a vehicle. Her body was then decapitated, and head placed upon a pike in the middle of Sofia in an attempt to cause Jassim to come fight to retrieve it. Over the next several months, Sattar encouraged members of the tribes affiliated with SAA to join the Iraqi Police. Elements of the Army Brigade stationed aboard traditional Albu Risha land now called Camp Ramadi, were instrumental in getting these recruits organized, trained, and equipped. In addition to their decision to support the Iraqi Police, tribal militias were organized across Anbar into what became known as PSFs (Provincial Security Forces), and were ultimately accepted by the Ministry of Interior. These forces later were attacked by the first chlorine gas suicide vehicle-born improvised explosive device (SVBIED) in late January, 2007, killing over 17 of their forces and demonstrating the threat Al Qaeda in Iraq considered these local security forces. Fighting against the Americans in the earlier phases of the war, elements of this group have since allied themselves with the U.S. to rid their country of foreign extremist composing mainly of al-Qaeda in Iraq. It has been reported that they have received cars, guns, and ammunition by the Iraqi and U.S. forces to counter the radical Islamists in Al-Anbar province. In recent months elderly sheiks and tribal leaders have turned away from the Islamic State of Iraq, a radical Sunni extremist terrorist organization who specializes in car bombs and suicide attacks. On May 1, 2007 the Anbar Salvation Council announced that it had killed Abu Ayyub al-Masri, the war minister of the Islamic State of Iraq and the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq. However, the U.S. military has refuted this claim and the status of al-Masri is still uncertain. While it is unknown if the Al Anbar Salvation council killed Abu Ayyub Al Masri, during the first few months of the council's existence, it is said that they killed more high level insurgents than US forces in the area. =Founding= Sheik Abdul Sattar Buzaigh al-Rishawi was a Sunni leader in the Al-Anbar province leading a growing movement of Sunni tribesmen who have turned against al-Qaida-linked insurgents. Al-Rishawi, whose father and three brothers were killed by al-Qaida assassins, said insurgents were \\"killing innocent people, anyone suspected of opposing them. They brought us nothing but destruction and we finally said, enough is enough.\\" Al-Rishawi founded the Anbar Salvation Council in September 2006 with dozens of Sunni tribes. Many of the new newly friendly leaders are believed to have at least tacitly supported the insurgency in the past, though al-Rishawi said he never did. His movement, also known as the Anbar Awakening, now counts 41 tribes or sub-tribes from Anbar, though al-Rishawi acknowledges that some groups in the province have yet to join. It's unclear how many that is, or much support the movement really has. On September 13, 2007, al-Rishawi was killed along with two of his bodyguards by a roadside bomb near his home in Ramadi, Anbar, Iraq.

After his debut at seventeen years old, Bode recorded hundreds of songs on the gramophone, many of them his own compositions. One of his best-known songs is \\"En herre i frack\\" (A Gentleman in Tailcoat), which G√∂sta Ekman (senior) sang in 1936. The song later become popularized by famous Swedish singer Jan Malmsj√∂, who added it to his repertoire. The last gramophone record with Johnny Bode as a singer was recorded in 1942. The life of Johnny Bode is one of the most amazing in the history of Swedish music. Over and over again, when his career was demolished, he was able to rise and build a new career, only to ruin it himself shortly after. For the most part, Bode lived far more extravagantly than he was able to afford. He was a well-known figure in show business in those days, and was liked in the pubs because of his generous style. Even the fact that he was often broke didn't stop him. He was a master of sneaking out the back door and letting others pay his debts. Another distinguishing characteristic of Bode was his unmatched mythomania. Over and over again he lied to others, a personality flaw that blackened his career. He became good friends with G√∂sta Ekman and was almost like a son to him, until the day Ekman discovered that Bode had tried to sell their silverware set to a pawnbroker. Bode skipped out on countless hotel bills, and was blacklisted by several of Stockholm's finest restaurants. He was also involved in the theft of expensive carpets, and embezzlement through false checks. Bode's out-of-control lifestyle many times led him into crime. After many cases of fraud, he was declared incapable, and put into psychiatric care in the mental hospital of St. Sigfrid in V√§xj√∂, Sweden. In connection with the diagnosis, he was sterilized.  Johnny Bode and the Nazi connection  Before World War II, Bode became fascinated by Nazism, which blacklisted him in Swedish show business for the rest of his life. Apparently, it was the combination of uniforms, marches, and pompous culture that enticed the childish Bode. He was able to get permission from the mental hospital to travel to Finland, where he enlisted with the Nazis. However, the short, fat Bode soon became impossible and was sent home with an under-officer degree from the Nazi army. No sooner was Bode back on Swedish soil than he started to ruin his career once again. By the time of his arrival 1942, resistance to Nazism was bigger than ever. When the famous Swedish actor Karl Gerhard played his strongly Nazi-critical cabaret \\"Tingel-Tangel\\" for the hundredth time, Bode showed up in his Nazi uniform, with his degrees on his shoulders and the Iron Cross highly visible on his chest. After that, he frequently wore the uniform on his occasional visits to Stockholm's nightclubs. As a result, the only friends he had ignored him, and he became blacklisted in the Swedish entertainment industry. Shortly after that, Bode travelled to Norway, where he put up a cabaret for the Norwegian Quisling-regime. Bode promised gold and sunshine and lived a luxurious life in Oslo. Some of the songs he wrote during this period were seen in Sweden as critical of Sweden, especially the song \\"Har du h√∂rt vad Svensken sier\\" (NO: Have You Heard what the Swede's Saying?). This irritated the Swedish society and media even more. It was very hard for Bode to get in touch with actors who wanted to play in his cabaret, as nobody was willing to put their career at stake by appearing with Bode. Bode himself sang couplets and imitated Winston Churchill, to the great joy of Nazi sympathizers. After twenty-odd appearances, the show had to close due to lack of audience. Once again, Bode was making himself unwelcome. He drank too much, was stealing and skipping out on bills again. Bode was even taken in by the Gestapo and was imprisoned in the Grini concentration camp from 22 December 1942 to 30 January 1943. He was labeled a suspicious person due to his own claims to be a spy for the Swedish government, but by then his mythomania was so widely known that nobody believed him, and he was finally sent back to Sweden.  The DDR and Austria years  At the end of 1951, Bode traveled to DDR, where he attempted to make money exporting cinema movie rights to Sweden, and declared himself at a pompous press conference at the hotel Newa in East Berlin in 1953 to be \\"a friend of the German Democratic Republic.\\" However, he was soon expelled from the country. He traveled extensively and spent too much money, which resulted in him going bankrupt in October 1953. After a time of recovery in Sweden, he moved to Brussels to escape justice. When the Ministry of Foreign Affairs demanded that the Belgian authorities extradite him, he moved to Vienna in Austria. The Vienna Opera House suffered from major problems at this time and needed new influences. Johnny Bode, under the name of Juan Delgada, came as manna from heaven. His bad reputation had not reached Austria. There he wrote the operas Nette Leute, Liebe in Tirol and 12 Bildern (1959), Die Kluge Wienerin (1961) and Keine Zeit f√ºr Liebe. They became successes and were played across the world for many years. With the success came money and fame, but also contributed to the Swedish police finding him. In 1955 he flew to Sweden to serve a prison sentence. A divorce followed. Back in Austria, however, Bode married the 22-year-old Inge Pelz on the Midsummer Day in 1957. The success in Austria continued, but was no good medicine for the labile Bode. He continued in more wild style. He called himself Kammers√§nger, an honorary title he had not received. At a press conference in Vienna he stated that he, using a pseudonym, wrote The Blue Danube (actually written by Johann Strauss II in 1866). Finally, in 1961, his young wife had enough and demanded a divorce. Bode responded by initiating a bizarre custody dispute concerning the couple's dachshund. Bode won the custody dispute and was allowed to visit the dog every Sunday. Eventually Vienna caught up with the truths of Bode, and he hastily left the country in late 1961. His time as the operetta king Juan Delgada was over. He still enjoyed using his fake Kammers√§nger title, which he claimed to have been given \\"by Joseph Goebbels in the presence of Prime Minister Quisling\\", if anyone questioned it. Later career In the late '60s and early '70s, Bode recorded several pornographic comedy albums, with titles such as Bordellmammans visor (\\"The Brothel Madam's Songs\\"), Bordellmammans dotter (\\"The Brothel Madam's Daughter\\") and Sex-revyn Stig p√• (\\"The Sex Revue Step Inside\\"). He also, under the name of Johnny Delgada, released a gay- themed single in Swedish and German, with the songs \\"Vi √§r inte som andra, vi\\" (\\"We, we're not like the others\\") and \\"Achilles klagan\\" (\\"The lamentations of Achilles\\").

It is a private American Bar Association-accredited law school located in Lexington in the Shenandoah Valley region of Virginia. Facilities are on the historic campus of Washington and Lee University in Sydney Lewis Hall. W&L; Law has a total enrollment of approximately 365 students in the Juris Doctor program and a 6-to-1 student to faculty ratio. History The Lexington Law School, the precursor to W&L; Law, was founded in 1849 by United States federal judge John White Brockenbrough and is the 16th oldest active law school in the United States and the third-oldest in Virginia. The Law School was not integrated into Washington and Lee University (then known as Washington College) until after the Civil War when Robert E. Lee was president of the university. In 1866, Lee annexed the school, known at the time as the School of Law and Equity, to the college and appointed Judge Brockenbrough as the first dean. In 1870, after Lee's death, the School of Law and Equity was renamed as the Washington and Lee University School of Law, in line with the college's name change in honor of Lee. Also in 1870, former Virginia Attorney General John Randolph Tucker was appointed to the faculty and later became Dean followed by his son Henry St. George Tucker, Sr. In 1900, the law school moved into the newly built Tucker Hall in memory of Dean Tucker. Tucker Hall also housed the law school's first law library‚Äîthe Vincent L. Bradford Law Library. After significant periods of growth, the law school moved into new Tucker Hall after the original building was destroyed in a fire and the law library was rebuilt with a grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York. In 1920, W&L; Law joined the Association of American Law Schools. The Washington and Lee Law Review began publication in the Autumn of 1939 and is still in regular publication. After World War II, enrollment increased despite a period of low enrollment during the war. In 1950, the School of Law established its chapter of the Order of the Coif, one of only 80 such chapters in the country. The School of Law admitted its first female students in 1972, and opened its current home, Sydney Lewis Hall, in 1977. In 1992, the Lewis F. Powell, Jr. Wing was added to Sydney Lewis Hall and the Wilbur C. Hall Law Library at a dedication ceremony attended by Justice Powell and presided over by Chief Justice William Rehnquist. In 2008, Dean Rodney Smolla announced the new third-year program, which became compulsory for W&L; Law students in 2011 under Interim Dean Mark Grunewald. This new program turned the entire third year into an experiential curriculum which emphasizes practice, professionalism, and service. Nora Demleitner served as Dean from 2012 through 2015, the only woman to hold the position, during which time the school completed its $35 million campaign, Honor Our Past, Build Our Future, renovated Lewis Hall, established the Washington, DC portion of W&L;'s third-year program, and significantly increased the employment and bar passage rates of its graduates. On July 1, 2015, Brant J. Hellwig became Dean of the law school, the 18th Dean since 1849. Also in 2015, W&L; Law formed an academic and professional partnership with the Future of Privacy Forum, an information privacy think tank in Washington, DC. The Future of Privacy Forum will facilitate professional, research, and curricular development and the Washington, DC portion of W&L;'s third-year program will move into its offices. Facilities Sydney Lewis Hall Sydney Lewis Hall is the home of the school of law on the historic campus of Washington and Lee in Lexington, Virginia. Lewis Hall was built in 1977 with a $9 million gift from Best Products founder Sydney Lewis and his wife Frances of Virginia. Lewis Hall was designed by Marcellus Wright Cox & Smith Architects in the Mid-century modern style. In addition to lecture halls, classrooms, and offices for faculty and staff, Lewis Hall houses the 150-seat Millhiser Moot Courtroom with the accompanying Robert E. Stroud Judge's Chambers and the Roger D. Groot Jury Room. The Millhiser Moot Courtroom serves as the continuity of operations site for the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Lewis Hall also has a cafeteria for students, staff, and faculty called the Brief Stop, which serves food, snacks, and drinks. As part of its $35 million campaign completed in 2015, Honor Our Past, Build Our Future, the School of Law renovated and modernized the facilities. The project resulted in more flexible space for student collaboration and study, new homes for four of the school's legal clinics and student organizations, more natural lighting, a new library reading room, a new high-tech trial courtroom, and an improved entry sequence and navigation for the building. Lewis Hall's cornerstones are the Wilbur C. Hall Law Library and Lewis F. Powell, Jr. Wing. The Wilbur C. Hall Law Library is a Federal Depository Library for the U.S. Government and includes a separate faculty library, a rare book room, and an audio-visual media center and is open 24-hours a day. The library houses more than 492,000 volumes and is unique in offering each student personally designated work and storage space. The Powell Wing was built in 1992 to house the professional and personal papers and archives of the United States Supreme Court Justice and noted W&L; alum as well as other manuscript collections, rare books, and archives of the law school. The Powell Wing includes an expanded main reading room space, in addition to stack area and work space for the papers. The archives are managed by full-time staff and are open to researchers, faculty, and students. Programs and admissions W&L; Law's full-time Juris Doctor program, one of the smallest in the country, is the primary degree-program at the Law School. The Class of 2021 numbered 131 students with a median LSAT of 163 and a median undergraduate grade point average of 3.50. International exchange programs are available for Juris Doctor students with Trinity College in Dublin and the University of Copenhagen in Copenhagen. Rankings and reputation Washington and Lee University School of Law ranked 31st out of 198 in the 2021 U.S. News & World Report national ranking of America's law schools. Since the U.S. News rankings of law schools were first released in 1987, W&L; Law has had an average ranking of 26th nationally. Brian Leiter ranked W&L; Law's endowment-per- student as 14th in the country, at $214,000 per student, when adjusted for cost-of-living. Above the Law ranked W&L; Law 22nd nationally in their 2019 Top 50 Law Schools rankings and, in 2017, 4th nationally in their rankings for the top-rated law schools when measuring alumni satisfaction. National Jurist ranked W&L; Law 15th in its list of best law schools for standard of living and 18th in its ranking of the best law libraries. The 2013 edition of On Being a Black Lawyer: The Black Student's Guide to Law Schools, ranked W&L; Law 25th in its rankings of the best law schools for black law students. In 2013, National Jurist named W&L;'s law faculty as the 10th most influential in legal education (the only entire faculty on the list) and 18th in 2014 as well as awarding W&L; Law's practical training program a B+ grade in its 2014 listing of the best law schools for practical training. National Jurist also ranked W&L; Law as the 5th best value private law school in 2016 in the United States. A ranking of scholarly impact published in the University of St. Thomas Law Journal ranked the faculty 30th nationally. A 2015 ranking by Business Insider, listed W&L; Law as the 17th best law schools in the United States to make connections and get a job. Washington and Lee's The Law News has been awarded the ABA's award of the finest law school student newspaper four times, including three years in a row, in 1985, 2013, 2014, and 2015. In 2016, National Jurist included W&L; Law on its list of one of the twelve best value private law schools in the United States. Bar exam results W&L;'s Virginia bar passage rate on the July 2017 exam was 86.67% (the state average was 76.43%); W&L; had the highest combined average passage rate among Virginia schools for the July 2014 and 2015 exams. W&L;'s New York bar passage rate on the July 2015 exam was 92.86% (the state average for ABA law school graduates was 79%). Nationally, W&L; Class of 2014 graduates had a 90% passage rate on bar exams in all states. W&L; Law was ranked as having the 20th best bar passage rate nationally based on Class of 2015 data. Post-graduation employment Based on Class of 2015 data, 85% of W&L; Law graduates obtained full-time, long term JD-required or preferred jobs within 10 months of graduation. 50% of the 2015 graduates obtained full-time long-term jobs in law firms (including 21% of graduates getting full-time, long term jobs in firms greater than 100 lawyers) and 19% of 2015 graduates obtained clerkships. The large law firms which employed the most W&L; Law graduates were Hunton & Williams, Alston & Bird, McGuireWoods, K&L; Gates, and King & Spalding. The School of Law ranked 18th on the 2012 U.S. News' ranking of law schools by recruiters from the top national law firms and 19th on the 2015 U.S News ranking of law schools that send the most students to clerk for a United States federal judge (6.9%). The National Law Journal ranked W&L; Law 33rd in its 2015 \\"Go-To Law Schools\\" list of law schools that send the highest percentage of students to the 250 largest law firms in the United States. Juris Doctor curriculum The Juris Doctor curriculum at W&L; consists three unique and integrated years of full-time study with a mix of traditional casebook method and practice-oriented courses. ;First-year In the 1L year, students take required foundational courses in contract law, tort law, civil procedure, criminal law, property law, professional responsibility, administrative law, and international law. Additionally, each student is assigned a small section in which one substantive required course also serves as a legal writing course. This small section consists of approximately 20 students. 1Ls are also assigned to an upper-level student from the Burks Scholar Program who teaches legal research and Bluebook methods. ;Second-year In the 2L year, students focus on advanced coursework. W&L; requires evidence law and constitutional law in the second-year as well as the completion of an upper-level writing requirement. The writing requirement can be satisfied through a seminar course, through an independent writing project, or a note in one of the law journals. All other courses in the 2L year are electives and commonly include corporate law and tax law as well as many other classes and seminars. Since establishing the practice-based curriculum, W&L; incorporated its experiential curricular offerings, such as practicum courses, into the second-year in addition to casebook-oriented electives. ;Third-year The new third-year program, which began in the fall of 2010, replaced further elective advanced coursework based on the casebook method as is the norm in most ABA law schools. Instead, the program is meant to simulate client experiences. The 3L year requires students to exercise professional judgment, work in teams, solve problems, counsel clients, negotiate solutions, serve as advocates and counselors ‚Äî the full complement of professional activity that engages practicing lawyers as they apply legal theory and doctrines to the real-world issues of serving clients ethically and honorably within the highest traditions of the profession. The Fall semester begins with an immersion course. Students are allowed to choose one of two courses for the two-week immersion. Immersion focuses on either litigation and alternative dispute resolution or transactional practice. Each student is then enrolled in practicum courses of their choosing. These courses cover substantive and advanced law but do so through practical methods of drafting paperwork and problem-solving rather than casebook and the socratic method. Students are also required to take a course in the legal profession as well as a law- related service requirement. Finally, each student is required to be involved in one of W&L;'s legal clinics, externship programs, or transnational programs to gain real-client experience. The program is flexible and allows students the ability to tailor their schedule and, if they wish, to take several traditional casebook method courses. The Honor System The Honor System has been run by the student body since 1905 and is derived from Robert E. Lee during his tenure as President of the University. Any student found guilty of an Honor Violation by his or her peers is subject to a single penalty: expulsion. The Honor System is defined and administered solely by students, and there is no higher review. A formal review, occasionally including referenda, is held every three years to refine the tenets of the Honor System. Students continue to support the Honor System and its single penalty overwhelmingly, and alumni regularly point to the Honor System as one of the distinctive marks they carry with them from their W&L; experience. W&L; Law students enjoy several distinct benefits from the Honor System. These include more freedom in exam taking as well as an informal account system at the Brief Stop cafeteria in Sydney Lewis Hall. These are balanced by the strict penalty of a violation of the Honor System. Clinics, journals, moot court, and centers Wilbur C.

NGC 4622 is a face-on unbarred spiral galaxy with a very prominent ring structure located in the constellation Centaurus. The galaxy is a member of the Centaurus Cluster. Spiral structure The spiral galaxy, NGC 4622 (also called Backward galaxy), lies approx. 111 million light years away from Earth in the constellation Centaurus. NGC 4622 is an example of a galaxy with leading spiral arms. In spiral galaxies, spiral arms were thought to trail; the tips of the spiral arms winding away from the center of the galaxy in the direction of the disks orbital rotation. In NGC 4622, however, the outer arms are leading spiral arms; the tips of the spiral arms point towards the direction of disk rotation. This may be the result of a gravitational interaction between NGC 4622 and another galaxy or the result of a merger between NGC 4622 and a smaller object. NGC 4622 also has a single inner trailing spiral arm. Although it was originally suspected that the inner spiral arm was a leading arm, the observations that established that the outer arms were leading also established that the inner arm was trailing. These results were met with skepticism in part because they contradicted conventional wisdom with one quote being ‚Äúso you‚Äôre the backward astronomers who found the backward galaxy.‚Äù The fact that a pair of arms could lead was not easy to accept. Astronomical objections centered on the fact that dust reddening and cloud silhouettes were used to determine that the outer arms lead. The galaxy disk is tilted only 19 degrees from face-on making near to far-side effects of dust hard to discern and because clumpy dust clouds might be concentrated on one side of the disk, creating misleading results. In response, the ‚Äúbackward astronomers‚Äù determined NGC 4622's spiral arm sense with a method independent of the previous work. The new Fourier component method is actually assisted by the small tilt, and dust reddening and cloud silhouettes are not used in the latest analysis. The Fourier component method reveals two new weak arms in the inner disk winding opposite the outer strong clockwise pair. Thus the galaxy must have a pair of arms winding in the opposite direction from most galaxies. Analysis of a color-age star formation angle sequence of the Fourier components establishes that the strong outer pair is the leading pair. While the presence of backward arms in a galaxy may seem like an inconvenient truth to many, two independent methods now indicate that NGC 4622's arms do indeed behave in a very unusual fashion, with the outer arms winding outward in the same direction the disk turns. A Fourier component image of the arm pairs is shown with one of the pair of arms marked for the newly discovered inner CCW pair (black dots) as well as one of the already known (CW) outer pair (white dots).

The species is widespread in North America, where its range extends from Canada south to Michoac√°n, Mexico. It is found in every U.S. state except Hawaii. The fast-growing, upright plant can reach heights of more than 3 m. It can be differentiated from most of the other members of its large genus by its honeycomb-pitted seeds, and further separated by its serrated, more or less evenly lobed lower leaves. Although widely regarded as a weed, this species was once one of several plants cultivated by Native Americans in prehistoric North America as part of the Eastern Agricultural Complex. C. berlandieri was a domesticated pseudocereal crop, similar to the closely related quinoa C. quinoa. It continues to be cultivated in Mexico as a pseudocereal, as a leaf vegetable, and for its broccoli-like flowering shoots.  Morphology  The leaf of C. berlandieri = Seeds = Chenopodium seeds vary in shape between lenticular and cylindrical. The lenticular shape is more typical of wild members of the species while cylindrical seeds (said to have a \\"truncated margin\\") predominate in domesticated varieties. The nutritive perisperm tissue is encircled by the embryo along the seed margin. The radicle protrudes slightly, producing a visible bump in the circumference of the seed (called the \\"beak\\"). Surrounding the perisperm and embryo are three layers: the inner epiderm, the outer epiderm, and the pericarp. The inner epiderm is also called a tegmen. The outer epiderm is synonymous with testa. Together, the outer and inner epiderm make up the seed coat. In Chenopodium literature, the terms outer epiderm, testa, and seed coat are often used interchangeably. The pericarp is often dehiscent, but is non-dehiscent in some varieties. In domesticated varieties, the seed coat may be reduced or absent. Uniform seed assemblages with seed coats less than 20 ¬µm thick are considered to represent domesticated population. Conversely, wild populations tend to produce seeds with seed coat thicker than 20 ¬µm. Taxonomy The species includes two subspecies: the type subspecies (i.e. C. b. ssp. berlandieri) and C. b. ssp. nuttalliae. The latter, which also goes by the common names huauzontle, huauthili and Nuttall's goosefoot, is a domesticated variety cultivated in Mexico. As many as six extant varieties of C. b. ssp. berlandieri have been identified: *C. b. subsp. berlandieri var. berlandieri *C. b. subsp. berlandieri var. boscianum *C. b. subsp. berlandieri var. bushianum (Bush's goosefoot) *C. b. subsp. berlandieri var. macrocalycium *C. b. subsp. berlandieri var. sinuatum *C. b. subsp. berlandieri var. zschackii (Zschack's goosefoot) The extinct variety is well-documented, though it may represent more than one taxon: * C. b. subsp. jonesianum Additionally, the cultivars of the C. b. nuttalliae subspecies are: *'Huauzontle' - This cultivar is a more recent selection used in commercial cultivation for a broccoli-like crop. It is a \\"naked\\" variety and has a testa only 2-7 ¬µm thick (cf. human hair, which is about 100 ¬µm wide). *'Chia' - Grown as a grain crop, this cultivar is declining and is cultivated only on a local level. It also has a very thin testa, though slightly thicker than the previous at 10-20 ¬µm. *'Quelite' - This cultivar is cultivated for its spinach-like leaves. The species is capable of hybridizing with the related introduced European Chenopodium album, which it resembles, giving the hybrid C. √ó variabile Aellen. Domestication C. berlandieri is the progenitor of all domesticated Chenopodium varieties in North and South America. In prehistoric eastern North America it was a part of the Eastern Agricultural Complex, a set of cultivated and domesticated species which supported sedentary and migrant populations for thousands of years. Archaeological evidence shows the species was extensively foraged as a wild plant in eastern North America as early as 6,500 BC. By 1700 BC, the plant had clearly been domesticated as a pseudocereal crop. The name given to the domesticated variety is C. b. ssp. jonesianum. The oldest evidence for domestication comes from caches of thin-testa seeds from rock shelters in the Ozark Plateaus and Ohio River basin. The goosefoot ceased to be cultivated in most of eastern North America around the time of European contact. The only known potential historic record of C. b. ssp. jonesianum is a c.a. 1720 account by Antoine Simon Le Page du Pratz. According to Le Page, the Natchez people cultivated a grain-like crop called Choupichoul that was delicious, nutritious, highly productive, and required minimal human labor. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the crop was a domesticated variety of C. berlandieri. Although cultivation disappeared in eastern North America, C. b. subsp. nuttalliae continues to be cultivated as a domesticated crop in Mexico. Three varieties of the subspecies are grown as a pseudocereal, as a leaf vegetable, and for its broccoli-like flowering shoots, respectively. The principal difference between wild and domesticated forms of Chenopodium is the thickness of the seed coat. In the domesticated varieties, due to selective pressures during domestication, the testas are less than 20 microns thick; the testas of wild chenopods are 40 to 60 microns thick.Smith, Bruce D. (1995), The Emergence of Agriculture, New York: Scientific American Library, p. 184 This morphological characteristic is shared by the modern cultivated chenopod C. b. subsp. nuttalliae and the archaeological specimens of C. b. ssp. jonesianum. Genetic studies have shown that eastern North American and Mexican cultivated forms have considerable genetic distance between them. Despite the initial assumption of a single domestication event, consensus in the field now supports at least two independent domestication events in North America. Similarly, C. berlandieri's South American branch likely experienced at least two independent domestication events, both of which are called C. quinoa. Chenopodium berlandieri growing near a pile of wood in Ontario, Canada.  Weed status  Chenopodium species have been implicated among the greatest weed threats to agriculture in North America and globally. Most research cites the European species C. album as an herbicide resistant weed threat. The weed status and herbicide tolerance of C. berlandieri is unclear due to difficulty distinguishing species within the subsections Leiosperma (i.e. C. album ) and Cellulata (i.e. C. berlandieri). As the cultivation of quinoa has spread globally, it has entered geographic regions with extant wild populations of close relatives including C. berlandieri in North America and C. album elsewhere. Proximity of the species allows cross-pollination and the formation of a crop-weed complex. Genetic introgression is often degenerative for both crops and wild plants; however, it can also be an opportunity to develop new crop varieties. Remarkably, the emerging quinoa and C. berlandieri crop-weed complex reflects the prehistoric genetic interaction of domesticated and wild chenopods in eastern North America.

He was also known as Baida in Ukrainian folk songs. Biography Dmytro Vyshnevetsky was born into the powerful family of Ruthenian magnate Ivan Wi≈õniowiecki (?-1542) (part of Gediminids bloodline and the youngest son of Michal Zbaraski) and Anastasia Semenivna Olizarovychevna (?-1536). The Wi≈õniowiecki family takes its roots from the princely family of Novhorod- Siverskyi, through Dmitriy Korybut (see Kaributas) and Anastasia of Ryazan. At first Dmytro Vyshnevetsky lived in the town of Vyshnivets of the Kremenets Powiat (county). In 1550‚Äì1553, Vyshnevetsky became a starosta of the Cherkasy and the Kaniv Powiats. He has been called the first true Cossack Hetman in history. Dmytro Baida Vyshnevetsky was an able leader, although somewhat of a reckless adventurer. He started organizing a Cossack army in 1550 against the Crimean Khanate. Displeased with the king Sigismund II Augustus's policy of Catholization and centralization of power, he was ready to go over to the Turks. However, he was appointed to fortify the island of Mala Khortytsia on the Dnipro beyond the rapids. According to Hrushevsky, Vyshnevetsky built the fortress out of his own pocket as both Sigismund II Augustus and Devlet I Giray refused to provide any assistance. Eventually he managed to develop it to the point that khan Devlet I Giray could not take it, and he deflected the khan's efforts to Moskovia. In 1556 in service to Ivan the Terrible he helped lead two raids of Ukrainian Cossacks and Russians against the Crimean Tatars around Ochakiv. In 1558 he raided around Perekop. In 1559 he raided down the Donets and Don. With the start of the Livonian War, Ivan turned his attention west and Vyshnevetsky, being Ivan's close relative and his governor in the North Caucasus, returned to the Lithuanian service with a great number of his Adyghe warriors. His detachments became the major military force of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in centuries to come. In 1561, at the request of the Lithuanian prince, he went back to fortifying Khortytsia. In 1563 he was involved in Moldavian affairs, perhaps hoping to obtain the throne of Moldavia, but was defeated by the Turks, taken prisoner, and after the refusal of Ivan the Terrible to free his relative, he was tortured to death in Constantinople. Vyshnevetsky's fortifications on Khortytsia, called sich, served as a prototype for later fortifications of the Zaporizhian Sich. In popular culture Probably not having any relationship to the situation, Vyshnevetsky's portrait is clearly featured in the epic-movie The Deluge by Jerzy Hoffman. He also appears as an antagonist in The Ringed Castle, a 1971 novel by Dorothy Dunnett.

These are behaviors of either the patient or the therapist. More obvious examples include being late to sessions, not completing homework, cancelling sessions, and forgetting to pay. More subtle examples can include sobbing uncontrollably, venting, criticizing the therapist, threatening to quit therapy, shutting down, yelling, only reporting negative information, saying \\"I don't know\\" repeatedly, and pushing the therapist's limits. Behaviors that \\"burn out the therapist\\" are included, and thus, vary from therapist to therapist. These behaviors can occur in session, group, between sessions, and on the phone. DBT requires therapists to directly address TIBs as a way to prevent early termination from therapy, to improve the relationship between therapist and client, and to model effective communication.

Oropharyngeal swallowing in normal adults of different ages. Gastroenterology 1992;103:823-9. Although age-related changes place older adults at risk swallowing disorders, an older adult‚Äôs swallow is not necessarily an impaired swallow. Clinicians are becoming more aware of the need to distinguish among swallowing disorders, presbyphagia (an old yet healthy swallow) and other related diagnoses in order to avoid over diagnosing and over treating presbyphagia. Older adults are more vulnerable and with the increased threat of acute illnesses, medications and any number of age-related conditions, they can cross the line from having a healthy older swallow to being dysphagic. Work focused primarily on the anatomy and physiology of the oropharyngeal swallowing mechanism indicates a progression of change that may put the older population at increased risk for swallowing disorders.Tracy F, Logemann JA, Kahrilas PJ, Jacob P, Kobara M, Krugla C.

Age effects on the temporal evolution of isometric and swallowing pressure. J Gerontol Med Sci 2000;55A:M634-M640. Such changes combined with naturally diminished functional reserve, the resilient ability to adapt to physiological stress, make the older population more susceptible to dysphagia.  Age- Associated Changes in Swallowing = Age-Associated Changes in Oropharyngeal Swallowing = A major characteristic of older healthy swallowing is that it occurs more slowly. The longer duration is found to occur largely before the more automatic pharyngeal phase of the swallow is initiated. In those over age 65, the initiation of laryngeal and pharyngeal events, including laryngeal vestibule closure, are delayed significantly longer than in adults younger than 45 years of age. Although the specific neural underpinning is not confirmed it might be hypothesized that oral events become ‚Äúuncoupled‚Äù from the pharyngeal response, which includes airway protection. Thus, in older healthy adults it is not uncommon for the bolus to be adjacent to an open airway by pooling or pocketing in the pharyngeal recesses, for more time than in younger adults. Whereas older adults demonstrate a delay in the onset of specific pharyngeal events, such as opening of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) to permit bolus passage from the pharynx into the esophagus, an equally critical finding is that the range of UES opening is diminished. A scintigraphic study revealed increased pharyngeal residue with age, possibly related to the limited UES opening. Again, these findings indicate exposure of an open airway to material retained in the pharynx, increasing the risk for aspiration in older individuals. Aspiration (defined as entry of material into the airway [trachea] thus passing below the vocal folds) and airway penetration (defined as entry of material into the laryngeal vestibule but not below the level of the vocal folds) (Figure 2) are believed to be the most significant adverse clinical outcomes of misdirected bolus flow. In older adults, penetration of the bolus into the airway occurs more often and to a deeper and more severe level than in younger adults. When the swallowing mechanism is functionally altered or perturbed in older people, such as with the placement of a nasogastric tube, airway penetration can be even more pronounced. A study examining this issue found that liquid penetrated the airway significantly more frequently when a nasogastric tube was in place in men and women older than 70 years. That study and additional evidence indicates that under stressful conditions or system perturbations, older individuals are less able to compensate due to the age- related reduction in reserve capacity (add Pendergast reference) and are more at risk to experience airway penetration or aspiration. = Age-related Change in Lingual Pressure Generation = The tongue is the primary propulsive agent for pumping food through the mouth, into the pharynx while bypassing the airway and through to the esophagus. Recent findings clearly reveal that an age-related change in lingual pressures is another contributing factor to presbyphagia. Healthy older individuals demonstrate significantly reduced isometric (i.e., static) tongue pressures compared with younger counterparts. In contrast, maximal tongue pressures generated during swallowing (i.e., dynamic) remain normal in magnitude. because, fortunately, swallowing is a submaximal pressure-demanding activity. In general, swallowing is considered a submaximal pressure task such that peak tongue pressures used in swallowing are lower than those generated isometrically. Although older individuals manage to achieve pressures necessary to affect a successful swallow, despite a reduction in overall maximum tongue strength, they achieve these pressures more slowly than young swallowers. It has been suggested that the slowness that characterizes senescent swallowing may reflect the increased time necessary to recruit sufficient motor units to generate pressures necessary to operate an effective, safe swallow.

He suggested that if Markarian 205 is not an accidentally projected background object, then it may instead have been ejected from the nucleus of this galaxy. The discovery of an apparent luminous connection between the two created a storm of controversy as astronomers sought to refute the assertion and provide other explanations. The matter was effectively settled when observations using the Hubble Space Telescope showed that the light from Markarian 205 was passing through the disk and halo of NGC 4319 to reach the observer, placing Markarian 205 behind this galaxy and thus further away.

Plot summary The Downsiders are a secret community of an unknown population (either native-born or \\"fallers\\" from the topside) dwelling underneath New York City. They are a proud, noble community who get by on giving new life to things and people thrown away by the Topsiders (the surface people). Downsiders are not allowed to travel to the surface, and every contact with Topsiders is strictly forbidden, since it is said that it would lead to the fall of the Downside. Talon, a fourteen-year-old Downsider, is curious about the Topside; he travels to the Topside and meets a fourteen-year-old girl named Lindsay Matthias, who just moved from Texas to live in NY with her father after her mother went to Africa with her professor for three years to study the white rhino. After a rocky beginning, they become interested in each other and eventually fall in love. However, when Talon brings Lindsay to the Downside, the Wise Advisors (a circle of corrupted people serving as the government for the Downsiders, since there has not been a proper leader for ages) find out Talon's transgression and sentence him to death by sending him down the pipe system. Talon survives; he winds up on Coney Island \\"under the boardwalk,\\" and has the time of his life, experiencing the \\"strange Topside rituals\\" for the first time. Meanwhile, the construction workers who work under Lindstay's father (an engineer who aims to build a new, massive aqueduct for the residents of New York) end up finding traces of some mysterious people dwelling underside the city, and the Topsiders become aware of the Downsiders and want to catch them. As Talon heads for the Downside, the Downsiders meet at the city hall (\\"Hall of Action\\") and plan to take action against the Topsiders. Railborn Skinner, Talon's former friend and the person who ratted Talon out, suggests knocking out the Topside's utilities to punish them for their \\"ungratefulness.\\" Talon comes back and tells the Downsiders, who thought he was dead, about what he saw in the Topside; when the Wise Advisors ask Railborn what to do, Railborn orders for Talon to be sent to the Chamber of Soft Walls (the Downside mental ward). In the midst of the events, the Topside's utilities are knocked out (which include electricity, gas and water). However, rather than panicking, the New Yorkers decide to party instead, and the mayor passes an order that the utilities be shut down once per year in a celebration known as \\"The Festival of Outages\\". Meanwhile, Lindsay, who has become curious about thr Downsiders, searches for info about the Downside's origin, and eventually finds that the Downside was created over 100 years ago by an eccentric engineer named Alfred Ely Beach, who faked his death and sook refuge to the Downside along with his supporters after being chasen away by the corrupt mayor of NY. Lindsay sneaks into the Downside and gives the information to Talon, hoping that it may bring peace with the Topside. At first, Talon is angry at this information; he soon, however, realizes what to do. He demands to the guard to be released and travels to the Chamber of First Runes, where only a Most-Beloved (the true Downside's leader) is allowed in. In the secret room, Talon sees the grave of the late Alfred Ely Beach, the forgotten creator of the Downside and the first Most-Beloved, and after having a \\"conversation\\" with him, he leaves, deciding what to do with his people. At the same time, a large piece of rock impales Gutta, and leaves her severely wounded. Railborn carries Gutta to a hospital on the Topside, and they are both labelled wards of the state. At the hospital, Railborn does a ritual swearing he would cut all ties with the Downside. Once Gutta is healed, the both of them are sent to an orphanage where they begin a new life as people of the Topside. Meanwhile, on the surface, Mark, Lindsay's father, is being blamed for the outages. The city orders his resignation, and he signs the resignation papers after rekindling his strained relation with Lindsay. As the two share the moment, an explosion is heard and felt. The explosion is actually half of the Downside, which was destroyed, and sealed up as a result, in a plan by Talon to keep the Topsiders out. The plan works, and Talon, who is now Most-Beloved, later returns to the Chamber of First Runes and leaves Lindsay's information at Beach's grave, deciding not to divulge the true origin of the Downside; he sees Beach's journal there, and though as tempting as it is to read it, Talon leaves it. Upon exiting the chamber, Talon tells the guards to never let anyone (himself included) in until a new Most-Beloved arises. Talon and Lindsay meet up again months later. Talon takes Lindsay to the top of an abandoned skyscraper; Downsiders are now living atop them, and this area is called the Highside. Talon tells Lindsay that once the Downsiders know what all the Topsiders know and are on equal ground with them, they will reveal themselves to the world, but until then, they have to be left alone. As such, Talon and Lindsay must cease to see each other; they spend their last moments together by gazing at a beautiful sunset.

Early life McCormick (as he was known) was born in Chicago, May 27, 1859. He was the youngest of four children born to Henrietta (n√©e Hamilton) McCormick and Leander J. McCormick. His grandfather Robert McCormick of Virginia invented agricultural machinery. His father, Leander J. McCormick, came to Chicago in 1848 and was a partner with his brothers, Cyrus and William to form what would become International Harvester. At the age of fourteen, McCormick invented a non-pickable door lock. While at college he invented two automatic railroad car couplers and a ballot box to register votes and prevent fraud at the polls. His principal sport in youth was boxing. He was one of the founders of the Amherst chapter of the Beta Theta Pi Society. McCormick received his education principally at Phillips Academy, Andover, and at Amherst College, graduating in the class of 1881. Interests and collections After graduating from Amherst he resided for several years in New York City, where he took a course in law at Columbia Law School in New York City and studied architecture. He also devoted his time to his study of Characterology. After finishing his education he traveled in the United States, Europe, northern Africa, Mexico, Central America, Yucatan, the West Indies and the Bermudas. He collected paintings, old armor, ancient pottery, old ivories, primitive glassware and objets d'art while living in London for seventeen years after his marriage. His art collection included 200 examples of the Italian, early English and old Dutch schools. McCormick reportedly made over a hundred inventions and took out many patents. However, since he inherited a fortune, he did not need to earn a living. He claimed to have invented an aerial torpedo, motorcycles, eyeglasses for looking backward while driving, a watch which shows the time the world over, an electric rotary brush, an electric rotary razor, an apparatus to locate vessels in a fog at sea, a boat which will not rock in rough water, a quadricycle to lessen vibration upon rough roads, an hydroplane for skimming over the surface of the water, an ambulance to prevent shock or vibration to its occupant, an audiophone for theatre use, a water cycle, a scheme to bridge the English Channel, and finally at the end of the World War I an improvement in war tanks, which came just as hostilities ended. During World War I, he was a government consultant at Washington, DC on financial, military and naval issues. =Sculptures= In sculpture his principal works were a three- quarter-life sized statue entitled \\"Sapho\\" one of \\"Victory,\\" and a figure emblematic of \\"The Birth of a Spirit.\\" = Books = He wrote two works on phrenology: Characterology: an exact science (1920) and Student's Course in Characterology: an exact science in fifteen lessons (1921). He also wrote on other related topics. These writings are dated and marred by the underlying assumptions of white supremacy, views which were not rare at the time. =Personal life= McCormick's son, Alister, 1917. In 1886, while touring Europe, he met Constance Plummer (1865‚Äì1938), the daughter of Edward Plummer, of Canterbury, England, whom he married on February 15, 1887.

The Prinz-Carl- Palais was planned in 1803 by the young architect Karl von Fischer for Abb√© Pierre de Salabert, a former teacher of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. On the death of the Abb√© Salabert in 1807, Maximilian I Joseph acquired the building. After his death in 1825, his son, Ludwig I, gave the building to his brother Prince Carl. He ordered Jean-Baptiste M√©tevier and Anton Schwanthaler to decorate the rooms.

The principal is Tim Kerr and the Athletic Director is Cyle Riggs. The school's mascots are the Suns and the Lady Suns. Currently, the Suns are co-oping some sports with local Central Camp Point. The teams co-oping are: *Central-Southeastern Girls basketball (The CSE Lady Panthers) Ended co-op: *Central-Southeastern football (The CSE Panthers) *Central-Southeastern baseball (The Suns) History The building was constructed in 1920, and was home to the Augusta Redskins until the 1970s, when the school consolidated with Bowen High School to become the Southeastern Suns. In the early 1990s, Plymouth High School, located in Plymouth, Illinois completed the consolidation to make Southeastern High School a public facility serving students from the three villages and other outlying areas. On March 3, 2006, Southeastern High School was burnt to the ground after a fire that started in the Chemistry lab on the third floor, completely gutted the entire floor, resulting in floor collapse, and extensive water damage to the bottom floors. The fire started at approximately 11:30 AM, during the students' lunch time/study hall. As a result, no student or faculty member was injured. Firefighters from six area units assisted in the task of extinguishing the flames. Firefighters persisted in their mission until early morning hours. After taking the following Monday and Tuesday off school, Southeastern High School classes reconvened at Southeastern Jr. High School in Bowen, Illinois and at the Bowen United Methodist Church, both just six miles away from the original Augusta location. Southeastern and the outstanding assistance of the students and the community caught many peoples attention all over Illinois, and from places as far away as Arizona and Bakersfield, California. On May 21, 2006, 45 seniors, previously unsure of their future at Southeastern, celebrated their graduation in the gymnasium at the Augusta campus, less than three months after the destructive fire. The graduation was the most attended in recent memory, attracting much attention from around the surrounding area. The new school was finished being built the beginning school year of 2008.
