Unlike a circular saw with a rotating blade, a cast saw uses a sharp, small- toothed blade rapidly oscillating or vibrating back and forth over a very small angle to cut material. This device is often used with a cast spreader. The patient's skin frequently comes into contact with the cast saw blade without cutting although it can cause lacerations when used over bony prominences. The design enables the saw to cut rigid materials such as plaster or fiberglass while soft tissues such as skin move back and forth with the blade, dissipating the shear forces, preventing injury. A general technique in the use of cast saw often involves a demonstration before actually cutting the cast. Modern cast saws date back to the plaster cast cutting saw which was submitted for patent on April 2, 1945 by Homer H. Stryker, an orthopaedic surgeon from Kalamazoo, Michigan. Cast removal procedures result in complications in less than 1% of patients. These complications can include skin abrasions or thermal injuries from friction between the saw and cast. Temperatures exceeding have been recorded during removal of fiberglass casts. Proper use of the saw is to perforate (instead of cutting) the cast, which can then be separated using a cast spreader. Alternatives include cast cutting shears which were patented in 1950 by Neil McKay.

She built many well- known sites in the city of Burgas, including the Boulevard Hotel, the residence of , many commercial buildings, as well as schools. In 1968, she was awarded a gold badge and made an honorary member of the . Early life Maria Luisa Doseva was born on 8 September 1894 in Targovishte, Bulgaria to Konstantin Dosev, a banker and merchant who served in the National Assembly for several terms. She completed her primary and lower secondary education in Targovishte, before entering high school in Veliko Tarnovo. Upon her graduation from high school, in Varna, she received recognition from the Ministry of Education. Though architecture was considered a male occupation in her era, Doseva moved to Germany in 1913 to enroll at the Technical University of Munich, but was refused admittance based on her gender. Intent on studying architecture, she applied to the Technical University of Darmstadt and was accepted for the 1913 term. After completing her first year studies, Doseva returned to Bulgaria to complete her practice internship and requested work in southern Bulgaria, where there was a building boom caused by the large number of refugees who had settled around Haskovo after the Balkan Wars. She graduated on 20 December 1917, with an architectural degree, a few weeks after Elena Markova (), a fellow student in Darmstadt, who was from Sophia, and was awarded authorization to work as an architect from the Ministry of Public Buildings, Roads and Public Works. For a brief time after her graduation, Doseva returned to Targovishte, where she married Minko Georgiev, an architecture student she had met in Darmstadt on 5 January 1918. Career The couple soon moved to Stara Zagora, Georgiev's home town, where their son, Georgi, was born. Because of a lack of work there, the family moved to Burgas, where Georgiev was appointed as a state architect. Doseva-Georgieva opened an office in their home at 25 Ferdinandova Street in 1920 and was hired to design a house in September of the same year. As her reputation grew, she worked on commercial buildings as well as residential properties in Burgas and the eastern cities of Sliven, Varna and Yambol. Their family also expanded as two daughters, Liliana and Milka were born. In addition to her architectural work, Doseva-Georgieva was active in women's social improvement projects. She co- founded the first kindergarten in Burgas, as well as a tailoring school to train girls in the profession. She was involved in the charitable organization \\"Mercy\\" () and actively worked on projects through the Independent Women's Association \\"Self-consciousness\\" () to improve civic and social access and protect the rights of women and children. Doseva-Georgieva designed emblematic buildings incorporating an eclectic mix of European and Arabic influences. Between 1920 and 1921, she designed the Boulevard Hotel in Burgas, near the railway station on Alexandrovska Street (later renamed Czechoslvakia Street). The building incorporated elements of the German secessionist movement with geometric forms and ornamentation of Islamic origin. In 1923, she designed the home of the merchant, Peter Kiulyumov (sometimes styled as Chulumov) () at #18 Prince Alexander Batenberg Street, which was followed by a residence for on the corner of Aleko Bogoridi Boulevard and Mihail Lermontov Street, as well as homes for other prominent citizens. Appointed as a project architect for schools, she designed educational facilities for Izvor, Kableshkovo, Kameno, Primorsko, Ravna Gora, Rusokastro, Sredets and Troyanovo, as well as other small towns and villages. After her husband died in 1947, Doseva-Georgieva was appointed as overseer and controller of the regional design organization in Burgas. In 1968, she was presented with the golden badge of the and installed as an honorary member of the organization. She worked as an architect until 1973, when she retired. Death and legacy Doseva-Georgieva died on 11 April 1975 in Burgas. She is remembered as the first woman to practice architecture in Bulgaria, as though she was not the first to be licensed, Elena Markova, did not work in the field after she received her license and married. The former Boulevard Hotel has been restored and is an icon in the central district of Burgas.

She served as Rwanda's minister of agriculture and animal resources from 2008 to 2014 and began her tenure as president of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) in 2014.  Early life and education  Kalibata was born in Rwanda and raised as a refugee in Uganda to parents who were smallholders. She earned a bachelor's degree in entomology and biochemistry, followed by a master's degree in agriculture, both from Makerere University in Uganda. She then earned a Ph.D. in entomology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. After graduating in 2005, she carried out research at the Kawanda Agricultural Research Institute with the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, in collaboration with Uganda's Makerere University and the University of Massachusetts.  Career  Kalibata served as Rwanda's minister of agriculture and animal resources from 2008 to 2014. Throughout her tenure, she promoted the use of science-based approaches to agriculture to increase food production and improve food security, with a focus on family farmers. She implemented policies, designed to connect farmers with neighbors and customers, as well as cooperative farming programs, and cow-sharing programs that made it easier for families to own cows. In the six years she was minister, Rwanda's poverty level dropped more than 50 percent; its agricultural sector's annual budget grew from under US$10 million to over US$150 million; and Rwanda became the first country to sign a compact under the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (an initiative of the African Union Commission). She has been praised by many for these accomplishments, but some human rights groups have criticized the policies because financial support was only given to farmers who followed the government's land consolidation policies. In 2014, she served briefly as the University of Rwanda's deputy vice chancellor for institutional advancement. Since September 2014, she has served as president of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), an African-led organization whose mission is to improve the food security and incomes of 30 million faming households in 11 African countries by 2021 by, among other things, providing access to better seeds and credit.

Overview Guglielmo Cappa was born in Garlasco, in the Province of Pavia on 21 July 1844. He attended high school and spent two years at University in Pavia. He then obtained a degree in Engineering in Turin. Career In 1871 he was hired by the Società per le Strade Ferrate Meridionali and was engaged in the construction of the difficult line between L'Aquila and Sulmona. He later became Head of the Traction Division of the Società per le Strade Ferrate Calabro-Sicule. In 1885 when the Sicilian railroads were broken up with the establishment of Rete Sicula, headed by Riccardo Bianchi, Cappa became the director of the Material and Traction Service. He was one of the main promoters of the establishment of the ferry in the Strait of Messina that began at the end of 1899. The work of the engineer Cappa was decisive in the design of new locomotives such as the RS Class 300, which later became the FS Class 410, but his main work was the excellent RS Class 400 tank locomotives, later FS Class 910. These were designed for the difficult Messina - Palermo line with the demanding Peloritani pass. After nationalization, they were transferred to Milan where they gave excellent service on suburban trains. A characteristic of the locomotives designed by Cappa was the use of Walschaerts valve gear which became widely adopted by the FS. In 1905 Riccardo Bianchi, director of the newly constituted Ferrovie dello Stato, wanted Cappa in Rome to direct the Material and Traction Service. Family Guglielmo Cappa was the father of Giulio Cesare Cappa, who became an automobile designer for the firm Aquila Italiana. Death In Rome, a tragic fate overtook Guglielmo Cappa a few months after his inauguration. On 1 September 1905, he was shot dead in his office in Via Boncompagni, by the Sardinian Giuseppe Cossu, who held him responsible for the lack of promotion of his son from stoker to driver.

The flowers are insignificant, yellow/green in colour, and are followed by small gum-balls that persist on the tree until winter. The wood exudes a sweet- smelling resin when pierced, giving the tree its common name. Liquidambar acalycina is cultivated as an attractive ornamental tree for parks and gardens, and is hardy down to or less. It requires cultivation in reliably moist, acid to neutral soil in full sun or partial shade. The cultivar ‘Burgundy Flush’, with leaves opening purple, then green, then burgundy red in autumn, has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit.  Characteristics  Liquidambar acalycina is a deciduous tree that has a brown to black colored bark with a conical/pyramidal shape. It matures quickly to be of a medium height ranging at 10m in height, and 6m width. The leaves have three lobes which make the tree similar to a Maple. However, they are more star shaped than maple leaves. The leaves emerge with a burgundy color in spring but as they grow and mature in summer, they become green which indicates their increasing ability to photosynthesize. When nearing fall the colors turn back into a red to purple color. During the months of April to May, monoecious flowers begin to bud with yellow-green colors, but are insignificant for pollination in attracting pollinators. The fruit of this tree is a dark brown black color. This tree serves as a shade tree for gardens. This Sweetgum Tree prefers soil that is acidic, clay-based, and is in a region with ample sunlight.  Distribution  This tree is native to East Asia, specifically in Southeast China. Other species can be found in Southern China and the United States of America.  Disease and Infestation  This tree is generally stable in the specific climates in which it exists. However, some insects can infest the tree, such as webworms, bagworms, caterpillars, leaf miners, and borers. Other issues that some trees experience in this species are canker and bleeding necrosis, and can become extreme. If the plant is growing in alkaline soils, the trees may experience iron chlorosis. Other issues include dark spots on leaves, and wood rot.

The hypothesis' name comes from the 1924 book Beau Geste, and was first coined by John Krebs in 1977.  Background  The Beau Geste hypothesis which was coined by Krebs in 1977 to explain why various avian species have such large song repertories. The hypothesis discusses that avian species utilize such large song repertories for potentially a number of reasons such as for territorial defence and to test the competition within a new habitat. The name of the hypothesis comes from the book which was originally published in 1924 \\"Beau Geste\\".Wren, P.C (1924). Beau Geste. The book tells the story of three English brothers which all enlisted in the French Foreign Legion and ended up in a desert battle against a Tuareg army. They were greatly outnumbered, and in order to create the illusion that they had more men then they actually had, they took whatever dead soldiers they could find and propped them up along the walls of the fortress.  Non-avian species  There has been mention of this hypothesis in places such as research into amphibian vocalizations in the Boophis madagascariensis, an endemic species of tree frog found in Madagascar,1Narins 2lewis 3McClelland, 1P.M 2E.R 3B.E (March 2018). \\"Hyperextended call note repertoire of the endemic Madagascar tree frog Boophis madagascarensis\\". the zoological society of London. 250: 283–298. where the Beau Geste hypothesis is used to give one explanation of why the species has such a large vocal repertoire. There has been some support for the theory in that the frogs use a wide variety of songs to give the illusion to invading frogs that the territory they are trying to enter is already full of competing frogs. The Beau Geste hypothesis has also been found to explain vocalizations within some cricket species such as the bush cricket, where males use a wide variety of songs to access the amount of competition which is in a given area. When males are present in an area with a large number of other males their vocal repertories are much smaller than when in an area with only a few males.

His parents were Thomas Chadwick and Edith Nottingham Baker, who were slaves on Robert Nottingham’s plantation in Northampton County, Virginia. His father became a Union soldier, and after the Civil War, Baker's mother taught him to read, which was a crime during slavery. > My mother taught me my letters, although I well remember when she learned > them herself.

In 1890, he entered Boston University and graduated three years later as the valedictorian of his class. He then studied at Yale Divinity School, where he earned a degree, and was ordained as a minister at a Congregational Church on Dixwell Avenue in New Haven.

CBS is typically caused by the deposit of tau proteins forming in different areas of the brain.  Classification CBS is the most common type of corticobasal degeneration (CBD) although the terms CBD and CBS have been used interchangeably in the past. The other three phenotypes of CBD are: *frontal-behavioral dysexecutive- spatial syndrome (FBS) *nonfluent/agrammatic variant of primary progressive aphasia (naPPA), and *progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome (PSPS).  Symptoms  Symptoms of CBS include apraxia, alien limb phenomenon, frontal deficits, and extrapyramidal motor symptoms such as myoclonus or rigidity. Movement deficits often begin on one side and progress to the other.  Pathophysiology CBD is the pathology underlying approximately 50% of CBS cases. Diagnosis The Armstrong criteria were proposed in 2013; the accuracy of these is limited and further research is needed. Symptoms may be symmetric or asymmetric, with one or more of the following: #limb rigidity or akinesia #limb dystonia #limb myoclonus, plus one of: #orobuccal or limb apraxia #cortical sensory deficit #alien limb phenomena (more than simple levitation) The onset is insidious with gradual progression, lasting one year or more, with no exclusion criteria present. The diagnosis is more likely if onset is after age 50, there is no family history (2 or more relatives), and there is no genetic mutation affecting T (e.g., MAPT). Probably sporadic CBS is more likely if there are two of: #limb rigidity or akinesia #limb dystonia #limb myoclonus *plus two of: #orobuccal or limb apraxia, #cortical sensory deficit #alien limb phenomena (more than simple levitation) The diagnosis is excluded if there is evidence of: *Lewy body disease *multiple system atrophy *Alzheimer's disease *amyotrophic lateral sclerosis *semantic or logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia *structural lesion suggestive of focal cause *granulin mutation or reduced plasma progranulin levels *TDP-43 or fused in sarcoma (FUS) mutations The diagnostic criteria for clinical use may result in a misdiagnosis of other tau-based diseases. The probable criteria are proposed for clinical research. =Differential= Other degenerative pathologies that can cause corticobasal syndrome include: * Alzheimer's disease * Pick's disease with Pick bodies * Lewy body dementias * Neurofilament inclusion body disease * Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease * Frontotemporal degeneration due to progranulin gene mutation * Motor neuron disease‐inclusion dementia. The symptoms of classic CBS differ from CBD in that CBD also includes cognitive deficits in the executive functions. Prognosis The average survival time after disease onset is estimated at 6.5 years.

Prodigal Sons Prodigal Sons is an autobiographical account of Kimberly Reed's return home to Montana for her 20th high school reunion as a trans woman. The film evolves into an exploration of family, sibling rivalry, coming out, and reconciling with the past. It debuted at the Telluride Film Festival in 2008. The Los Angeles Times describes Prodigal Sons as follows: > \\"At the heart of 'Prodigal Sons,' a family drama in the form of a succinct, > eloquent personal journal, is a sibling rivalry whose reverberations touch > upon the very essence of human identity: what we inherit, what we learn, how > we move forward and to what degree we look back. Reed receives a warm > reception at her 20-year reunion, but she's on eggshells with one of her > classmates, her adopted brother. Since he was left back in preschool, Marc > has been the struggler to her high achiever, his behavior problems > exacerbated by a brain injury. He's on multiple meds and given to hair- > trigger explosions that he says aren't the real him -- even as Kim looks at > pictures of herself as a boy and says with certainty, 'That wasn't me.\\"'\\" Reed's work on this project earned her much acclaim including a place on Filmmaker Magazine's list of \\"25 New Faces of Independent Film,\\" several award nominations including a GLAAD Media Award and Chlotrudis Award for Best Documentary.

She graduated from Hongik University in Seoul and received the Sovereign Art Prize in 2012. Her photographs are held in the Kyoto Photographic Museum in Japan, the Incheon Foundation for Art and Culture, and Seoul's OCI Museum. Lee is known for her surreal images, which she creates by physically transforming her studio space into intricate and imaginative dreamscapes using hand-constructed props and then photographing them without digital manipulation. Restrained by conventional photography medium, Lee added plastic creativity and theatrical performance to it.  Early life  JeeYoung Lee grew up aspiring to be a painter, and her first step to making it a reality was when she enrolled at an art high school. She then attended Hongik University to pursue a degree in Visual Communication Design. At the time, she was interested in film production art, but after taking a break from school to work as an assistant in a commercial production company, Lee realized that she would not take that path. While in search for a career path that would allow her to fully express her creativity, she worked on a photography exhibition as a project that helped her attain her bachelor's degree. This led her to find her niche, photography, and to continue her studies on the topic going into graduate school.  Works  Lee's art can be broken down into building, capturing, and then destroying. She uses the process of building the set as a way to relax herself from social repression and frustration, and to reflect about her inner conflicts, seeking to express them outwards. She then uses photography as a medium to record her reality. By finally destroying the set in the end, she puts the moment back in the past. Lee describes this entire process as a practice of emotional discipline. It takes about two to three months for Lee to complete one of her works. She works in a small, 12 x 14 x 8 feet studio to create the entirety of her elaborate scenes, removing the need for any photoshop at the end. = Notable Pieces = Resurrection This work was created in inspiration from the Tale of Sim Chong, a Korean folktale. Lotus flowers in Asian cultures symbolize rebirth and purity. By placing herself within the Lotus flower, Lee expresses how she has been reborn into a stronger figure, having overcome the negative elements in her life that were dragging her down. Anxiety This work addresses common worries, insecurity, and doubts that we experience in our daily lives. Unlike most of her other works, that involve a single photograph, Lee has taken two photographs as well as a video. The video features a performer making a strange noise, which is the phrase “it’s okay” cut into single syllables and being read as if she's singing. In an interview with CNN, Lee mentions that this work was one of the most memorable to her in that it was quite experimental.  Influences  Lee sees her art as a mode of self-expression in that she portrays snippets of her own memories, dreams or anxieties in her work. She also draws inspiration from Korean fables and famous artworks. Lee's creative combination of unusual plastic elements, as well as the expression of the unconscious mind, places her works at the very heart of Surrealism. Her style is most comparable to German sculptor and photographer Thomas Demand, as well as U.S. installation artist and photographer Sandy Skoglund. It is unclear whether or not she was directly influenced by their works. In an interview JeeYoung Lee mentions that some of her favorite artists include Kusama Yayoi, Tim Burton, and Michel Gondry.  Exhibitions  Lee's first group exhibition took place in 2007, in her home country Korea. In addition to having her first solo exhibition in Korea in 2009, she branched out and had her first solo exhibitions abroad in 2014. She now holds exhibitions both group and solo around the world and has had exhibitions in Australia, USA, Taiwan, and Ireland.  Collections  Lee's work is featured in the following collections: * Osan Culture Foundation, Osan, Korea * Kiyosato Museum of Photographic Arts, Kiyosato, Japan(2010) * Incheon Foundation for Arts & Culture, Art Bank, Incheon, Korea * OCI Museum of Art, Seoul, Korea * CAN Foundation, Seoul, Korea  References  Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:South Korean artists Category:South Korean women artists Category:Hongik University alumni ","title":"JeeYoung Lee"},{"id":"56941688","text":"The Philosopher's Annual (PA) is an annual selection of ten best papers in philosophy.

Berry (1854-1931) was an American hotelier who was among the most successful African-American hoteliers in the country during his era.  Early life and career  Berry was born at Oberlin, Ohio, in 1854, and was taken by his parents at the age of two years to Albany, Ohio, where unusual school facilities were offered African-American children. When he was old enough, he was sent to the Albany public schools, and when the Albany Enterprise Academy, a school for African-American children, was erected, he was able to attend it for a short time. Unfortunately, his father died in 1870 and young Berry was compelled, at the age of sixteen, to leave school and help provide for his family, in which there were eight children younger than himself. In his search for work he walked ten miles to Athens, Ohio, and was very happy to secure work in a brick yard at fifty cents a day. In a short time his work improved until he was earning $1.25 a day, the greater part of which he was able to divide with his family. He was never too proud to do any kind of honest labor, and although his work was hard and not inviting, it was the best he could do, and he decided to do it well. During the summers he remained at the brick yard, and in the winters was usually able to find employment in stores or elsewhere as a delivery boy or clerk. It was during these difficult years that he learned to practice economy. He did not use tobacco or intoxicants; because he could not afford them then. He said he was not able to afford them afterward, either. He also learned to seize opportunities which other boys allowed to slip by them. Whenever a circus came to town the other boys eagerly spent some of their hard earned money to see the show, but young Berry turned the circus to profit. He would rig up a refreshment booth and thus make more money than he would had he stayed at the brick yard. Whenever there were excursions, that form of extravagance in which so many of our people sink their savings, Berry would always get the privilege of selling refreshments on the train, thus enjoying the excursion and making a profit at the same time. Speaking of economy he said once that on many occasions he has walked ten miles to his home so that he might have an additional twenty-five cents for the dear ones there. While he was working at the brick yard, it was his custom to work every day and half the night, thus making the week nine days long. On rainy days when the brick yard was idle he would find some chores to do, or go to the country after cream for the ice cream makers. The first winter after the death of his father he worked at hauling bricks until his hands were cut to the quick by handling the rough surfaces. He was more than rewarded, however, by earning enough to take home four barrels of flour which were all paid for, at $7.80 per barrel. His first indoor work was in Parkersburg, West Virginia, where he was employed as errand boy in a dry goods store at $10 per month. Of this amount he regularly sent his mother $8 every month. It was in Parkersburg that he first secured work along the line in which he was afterwards to make so great a success. He got work in an ice cream parlor, where he served as a waiter. Returning to Athens, he secured employment in a restaurant, where he picked up the profession of catering. He soon became so proficient in this profession that he became personally in demand among the customers of his employers. The thought naturally occurred to him that if he could do so well for others he could do still better for himself. Meanwhile, in 1878, he married his schoolmate, Miss Mattie Madry, and began housekeeping in one room, in which, however, everything was paid for. The idea of setting up in business for himself would not leave his mind, but as he had no capital and no credit, the way seemed dark before him. His wife came to his aid. By her intercession her parents were persuaded to allow Berry to put the three dollars which he had been paying them weekly for his wife's board into what they called the \\"business capital.\\" In a few months he was able to start with his elder brother in the restaurant business with a capital of forty dollars. They commenced as \\"Berry Brothers\\", but, as the business was not large enough for two, Berry bought his brother out and went along alone. When Berry's employer learned that his best employee was about to set up as his rival, he was angry, and warned Berry that if he failed and returned looking for employment he would not get it, or even a meal if he were hungry. Berry had the pleasure some time later of materially assisting this man when he himself got into trouble. The business prospered from the first, and by 1880 Berry was able to buy a lot for $1,300. As soon as the lot was paid for, Berry secured a loan of $2,000 and put up his first building, which is to-day a part of the Hotel Berry. He did a prosperous trade as caterer and confectioner and soon had to hire a young man as assistant.  The Hotel Berry  Berry's success continued until 1893, when he decided to enter the hotel business. At first the outlook was gloomy. In the first place, the merchants of Athens met and decided to boycott any traveling salesman who stopped at the Hotel Berry. In July 1893 occurred the great panic, and on many a night Berry closed up with only one guest on the register. He had incurred a mortgage of $8,000 at seven percent interest. and was compelled to apply at the banks to borrow money to meet his notes. On one occasion both banks in the city refused to let him have money. He was almost in despair. As Berry was going out of the second bank a friend of his, who was standing by, seeing the look of distress on his face, asked him what the trouble was. Berry told him. The friend drew $500, the sum needed, from his private deposit and handed it to Berry, telling him to take it and use it without interest until he could repay it. This is the only time in his career, Berry said, that any person offered him any encouragement beyond empty words. The panic subsided, and the merchants were unable to drive the salesmen from Berry's hotel. One example will show the methods used by Berry to make his hotel popular. At night, after his guests had fallen asleep, it was his custom to go around and gather up their clothes and take them to his wife, who would add buttons which were lacking, repair rents, and press the garments, after which Berry would replace them in the guests' rooms. Guests who had received such treatment returned again and brought their friends with them. The Hotel Berry became the leading hotel in Athens. As of 1907, the hotel had fifty rooms, with baths and all modern conveniences, and an elevator. The hotel was so popular that men came from considerable distances just to spend Sunday there, and was a landmark on the trail of commercial travelers. Berry never refused to serve African-American men at his hotel — indeed, he said he would rather lose his customers than to be guilty of that sort of disloyalty.

It was a speech delivered by president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner at the National Congress of Argentina. Contents and delivery =AMIA case= The death of Alberto Nisman, the prosecutor investigating the 1994 AMIA bombing, took place two months before and sparked great political controversy. He had denounced Kirchner for attempting to conceal the role of Iran in it, with the Memorandum of understanding between Argentina and Iran, and judge Daniel Rafecas rejected the case some days earlier. Kirchner accused Nisman of holding contradictory standards and suggested that Nisman changed his mind for some unknown reason during his vacations, shortly before his death. She pointed that she attended all commemorations of the attack at the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina, pointing that it took place during an earlier government, and accused Israel of not holding a similar interest over the 1992 attack on Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires. =Economy= Kirchner accused the Vulture funds of trying to disrupt the economy of Argentina, and claimed that she had solved the problem of external debt for Argentina. She also announced that she would send a bill to the congress to nationalize the railway services. She justified the commercial deals with China, and announced bills that would seek to increase the industrial development. She also praised that overall wages had increased over 200% since 2003, when her husband Néstor Kirchner took office. As several economists criticised the state of the economy, she argued that the problems had not turned into a great crisis, and pointed that the summer season was a huge success. Responses Cristina Kirchner mentioned during her speech that the journalist Joseph Cotterill, from the Financial Times, had pointed out that the price of Argentine bonds was on the rise. Cotterill became aware of it within the day, and replied in Twitter: \\"Thanks for the mention in your speech, @CFKArgentina. But I fear that the bond's price is going up the less time you have left in office\\". The state of Israel issued a diplomatic answer to the speech. It pointed out that, although the territory of the Israeli embassy belongs to Israel, the responsibility for the security of the diplomats belongs to the host country. The speech was criticised by many leaders of the opposition. Senator Ernesto Sanz criticized that it did not mention the high inflation, crime rates and illicit drug trade. He also considered that it was unfair to raise criticism against Nisman, as he was dead. Senator Gerardo Morales criticized the conflictive tone of the speech and the criticisms to the judiciary. Sergio Massa criticized the length of the speech, over 3 hours, and considered that it was out of touch with the people's concerns.

It killed at least 60 people (more than half of which were children) according to official statements. The blaze started somewhere on the top floor of the four- story complex, and people were seen jumping from windows to escape it. 100 people were evacuated, and another 20 were rescued. Others claim the number of people killed in fire is being covered up, and that the real figure runs into the hundreds. According to the Russian authorities the source of these rumors was a Ukrainian prankster who called the morgue posing as an emergency services officer.  The Winter Cherry complex  The Winter Cherry shopping and entertainment complex ( Zimnyaya vishnya, torgovo-razvlekatel'nyy kompleks) is a mall in Kemerovo, Russia. The mall, which was converted from a former communist-era confectionery factory, opened in 2013 with 23,000 square meters of space, which included a petting zoo, children's center and bowling alley. The building was described as a labyrinth with few windows and points of entrance to the upper levels, with one main staircase, one lift shaft and one escalator.  Fire  Floor plan for the level 4 of Zimnyaya Vishnya shopping and entertainment center with the initial fire Survivors reported that the fire started on the fourth floor play area, with the heat of the flames rising to 700 °C, the heat so high it caused the bouncy castles to burst into flame. Many of the victims were in the mall's three cinemas, where two of the cinema roofs collapsed from the fourth floor into the third. Several of the victims in the cinemas were children watching Sherlock Gnomes to start off the first day of a week-long school break. A survivor from the cinema claimed that those in the cinema heard no alarm, and had to break through one door and jump to safety. Once on the ground, survivors could only see dense black pungent smoke that had filled the children's playground and the other cinema hall. The fire alarm system at Kemerovo shopping mall was switched off by a security guard. Many children who were trapped in the fire called loved ones and friends to exchange last conversations and information. One deceased child's aunt recounted their conversation during the fire in which the victim stated; \\"everything burns and the doors are locked in the cinema.\\" A spokesperson for the Investigative Committee of Russia also stated that the fire exits in the building were blocked during the fire. Tajik shopkeepers saved around 50 people through an alternate exit. Staff and guards of the center were criticized by survivors for not arranging an organized evacuation effort, while some were praised for their efforts.  Victims  At least 64 people were killed in the fire, 41 of them children. Also among the fatalities are some 200 animals from the petting zoo. Thirteen people had been hospitalized after the incident with the Russian Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova claiming the most gravely injured was an 11-year-old boy who jumped from a fourth floor window. Due to the fire, identification of most bodies had to have DNA identification used to confirm identifies. As of March 27, 60 individuals were treated in hospitals, of those 15 were hospitalized and 40 received outpatient care, and 25 victims, including 13 children had been identified.  First responders  Over 600 first responders spent over 17 hours fighting the flames well into the next day after the fire started. The fire spread to cover more than 1,500 square meters of the 23,000 square meter building, and kept firefighters from entering the building for 12 hours due to the heat and smoke. A father of three deceased victims was critical of rescuers, claiming he led rescuers up the stairs, but they turned away after being ordered to go elsewhere and refused to give him a respiratory mask citing regulations. In an interview he angrily stated \\"My daughters were left to burn because of their bloody rules.\\"The shopping mall in 2012.  Investigation  The Investigative Committee of Russia (IVR), opened an investigation into the cause of the fire, with the head of the IVR responding critically to the staff. In a statement he claims \\"Most of the staff ran away and left parents and their children to their fate.\\" Four people have been detained in relation to the fire, including the head of the shopping complex's managing company. Investigators reported that the fire alarm system had not been working the week leading up to the fire, rising into conflict with a previous report that a security guard turned it off. The mall security guards were cited for failing to promptly turn the voice alert system on and that there is no reasonable explanation to why it occurred. Kemerovo Oblast deputy governor Vladimir Chernov said that the preliminary suspicion is that a child had a cigarette lighter which ignited foam rubber in a children's trampoline room and erupted in the fashion of gunpowder. There is also speculation that the contracted builders and owners of the mall cut safety corners in the electrical wiring. Several arrests of these people have already been made.  Aftermath  Vladimir Putin in Kemerovo meets with citizens, 27 March 2018. Politicians across the globe sent their condolences. 28 March 2018 was declared the national day of mourning in Russia. A rally was held in Kemerovo demanding the resignation of Kemerovo Mayor Ilya Seredyuk and the longtime regional governor, Aman Tuleyev.\\"Russian Mall Fire: Protesters Demand Officials' Ouster\\". The New York Times. 27 March 2018. On April 1, 2018, Aman Tuleyev resigned as the governor of Kemerovo Oblast, citing \\"a heavy burden\\" of the Kemerovo fire, and President Putin accepted Tuleyev's resignation. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry criticized the announcement of expulsions of Russian diplomats by the United States and a number European countries in connection to the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter, which happened a day after the tragedy, as showing disrespect to the deceased victims. Local media named the owner of the mall, as millionaire Denis Shtengelov. Shtengelov countered in an interview that his stake in the mall at the time of the fire was only a minority stake with other investors, however, he promised to pay compensation of 3-million rubles (about $52,500) to the family of each victim. This would be in addition to the regional government's reported compensation to the families of victims, which is equivalent to $17,500 each. As of July 2018, the building is being demolished. = Memorials and tributes = Across Russia, central squares were turned into memorials for those killed with flowers and candles. A local memorial was erected in a plaza outside of the shopping center, and there was an influx of individuals donating blood for those injured. International memorials to the victims were erected in other locations, such as New York City.  Criminal charges  The Investigative Committee of Russia brought charges under part 3 of Article 293 of the Russian Criminal Code; neglect of duty which has entailed by negligence the death of two or more persons, against the head of a firefighting unit No.2. According to investigation reports lead firefighter did not listen to an eyewitness, who reported that people were locked up on the fourth floor, but sent the unit to a farther location losing time. Several other criminal cases were initiated with seven individuals being arrested.

E.) (Bee) Behymer (November 5, 1862 – December 16, 1947) was a music and theatrical manager in California for 60 years. In a time of theatrical and musical management typically dominated by large corporations, \\"Bee,\\" as he was known, operated independently. Upon his death, Rabbi Edgar Magnin commented:, \\"Because of Behymer, we have a cultured city today.\\"  Early life  Behymer was born in New Palestine, Ohio during the American Civil War while his father, Aaron S. Behymer, served at the front with the Union Army in the Battle of Gettysburg. Following the war, the family moved to Shelbyville, Illinois, and young Lynden pursued an interest in books and music. As a young adult, during the Black Hills Gold Rush era, he settled in the Dakota Territory to stake a mining claim. Here he married Minetta Sparks who was a local teacher and principal of a two-room schoolhouse. He became the proprietor of a store in Highmore, Hyde County (now South Dakota). After store and their home were destroyed in a cyclone, the couple relocated to California. He began working at the Grand Opera House in Los Angeles where he worked his way up to press agent and business manager.  Career  In 1886, Behymer was instrumental in bringing Los Angeles its first important operatic production by the National Grand Opera Company. The first symphony orchestra in Los Angeles was organized by Behymer, who managed it for 18 years. He formed the Philharmonic courses in the larger cities of the American Southwest in conjunction with local music clubs and gradually built up these centers of music to rival those of the East. The Hollywood Bowl idea was formulated at the Behymer home. The first of the Easter services at Mount Rubidoux in Riverside, California, came about through a fiesta given by Behymer that was attended by Theodore Roosevelt. The annual pilgrimage to the mountain at daybreak continues today. At the pinnacle of Behymer’s career, an average season would include about 250 bookings in about 250 cities in California and the West. Behymer started his career offering a variety of entertainment programming that would appeal to all segments of the then-small population. He would mix operatic performances with the likes of Enrico Caruso, Adelina Patti and Sarah Bernhardt with other entertainment by performers like James Whitcomb Riley, Mark Twain or various vaudeville acts.  Performers promoted  Many of the most famous individual artists in the musical, dramatic, scientific, historical and literary worlds have appeared in Los Angeles, California alone under Behymer’s management. Just a few of thousands of the personalities of the time presented under Mr. Behymer’s direction in the West: Sarah Bernhardt, Nellie Melba, Eleanora Duse, Tommaso Salvini, Edwin Booth, Adelina Patti, Enrico Caruso, Ignace Jan Paderewski, Mei-Lan-Fan, Lily Pons, John Philip Sousa, Anna Pavlova, Isadora Duncan, Maud Allan and Mary Garden. He branched into management of lectures which included those of Mark Twain and James Whitcomb Riley.  Honors  During Behymer's life he was decorated with 32 foreign honors as well as many local accolades. He held the Dutch Order of Officer of Orange-Nassau, the Serbian Order of St. Sava, the Italian Order of the Crown which made him a Cavalieri of Italy, the French Officer of the Palms, the Grecian Order of the Redeemer which came with a knighthood, the German Artistic Service, the Russian Order of St. Stanislaus, the Order of Danilo, Montenegro.

The painting depicts a red-headed woman, stripped to the waist, seated on the floor, facing away from the viewer, just before or just after bathing. It has been held by public collections in France since 1914: at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris since 1983. The painting depicts a domestic scene of a woman, sitting on a plain towel or sheet over a dark rug on the bare floorboards. She is largely undressed, with bare back, arms and head, hair tied back, and bare right thigh visible. A swathe of plain fabric is wrapped around her waist, with a black boot or stocking on her right lower leg. Other clothing is draped over a chair to the left. The work was painted in oils on cardboard, and measures . It employs a light colour palette, predominantly blues with yellowish greens and red for the woman's hair, thinned with turpentine to create a loose effect. The Impressionist image, similar to a work in pastels or a sketch, with an elevated viewpoint, shows some influence from similar works by Edgar Degas, including those exhibited at the 8th (and last) Impressionist exhibition in Paris in 1886. In the background are two wickerwork chairs and a bathtub, suggesting the woman is undressing to bathe, or getting dressed after washing. The furniture, recognisable from contemporaneous photographs, suggests the work was painted at Toulouse- Lautrec's studio on the in Paris. It may have been made in one session, directly from life, with no studies. The model may be one of Toulouse- Lautrec's favourites, Carmen Gaudin (1866?–1920). It was catalogued as La toilette and dated 1896 for some time, but recent research suggests it was painted several years earlier, in 1889. It was one of two works that Toulouse- Lautrec exhibited with Les XX (\\"The twenty\\", an avant-garde art group) in Brussels in 1890 under the title Rousse (red-head). In the catalogue, it was described as \\"a red-haired woman seated on the floor, seen from the back, nude\\". thumb Edgar Degas, ', 1886, from a series of seven paintings of women washing, which inspired Toulouse-Lautrec The painting was donated to the French state by on his death in 1914, and displayed in the Musée du Luxembourg, then at the Musée National d'Art Moderne, and later at the Musée du Louvre.

It is the main band that plays at official ceremonies and receptions for high- ranking officials that visit Russia, including heads of state, heads of government, and diplomatic delegations. Although it is not an official military unit, it is affiliated with the Military Band Service of the Armed Forces of Russia. Unlike the Special Exemplary Military Band of the Guard of Honor Battalion of Russia, which shares a similar role, the Presidential Band is the official band of the President of Russia and is based in the Kremlin.  History  The Presidential Band of the Kremlin Regiment of Russia was established in September 1938, being originally named the Moscow Kremlin Commandant's Band, for many years assigned as the official band of the Soviet KGB at state events. On January 11, 1993, Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered the band to be renamed to its current title. The band plays at a large number of concerts, in Russia and abroad, performing at prestigious venues and major international festivals. Since autumn 2004, the band has taken part in the changing of the guard in the Kremlin, which was revived that year. In addition to its concert band, the band also includes a symphonic orchestra and a symphonic pops orchestra, making it possible to broaden the repertoire from classical and folk music to rock compositions. The band cooperates with Russian and foreign celebrities, such as Iosif Kobzon and Ken Hensley. Currently, the repertoire of the band includes 16 ballet performances, including Swan Lake, The Nutcracker and Sleeping Beauty. The band has given more than 700 performances in the Grand Kremlin Palace, as well as foreign theaters such as, the Kennedy Center, Madison Square Garden, the Rome Opera, and the Friedrichstadt Palace.http://vpc-vympel.ru/istoriya-prezidentskogo- polka/  List of conductors  * N.

Description The LG5/QLU-11 can be equipped with a fire-control system with a laser rangefinder, thermal imaging capability, and a ballistic computer that gives it air burst capability. The QLU-11 was tested in combat against Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden by Chinese marines. In 2018, an undisclosed Middle Eastern customer was reported to have ordered it. That customer has later been confirmed to be Saudi Arabia. The LG5/QLU-11 is designed for long-range use and so has been described as a \\"sniper\\" grenade launcher. Befitting that designation, it is said to have a very high accuracy of 3-round R100 accuracy of 1 meter at 600 meter range, meaning that with proper aiming the weapon can put three successive high-explosive rounds into a typical window or door. Its development was inspired by the American Barrett XM109 anti-materiel rifle, which fires 25 × 59 mm grenades, and its design is based on the Chinese HSARI LR2 .50 caliber anti-material rifle. Variants There are two variants of the weapon, an export version and a domestic version: *LG5: Export 40x version.

In the story, people the size of fruit flies are expelled from their home and thrust outside into the woods. The novel tells the tale of Aurora, a sweet girl who finds herself taking a leadership role in the community of tiny people. The story starts out with a whimsical tone but rapidly devolves into a morbid narrative. Although much of the plot revolves around Aurora, small segments of the story focus on side characters who serve to emphasize the contrast between the daunting situation at hand and the playful way characters interact.  Plot  The protagonist Aurora is on a date with Prince Hector when they are suddenly expelled from their home, which happens to be the corpse of a young human girl. Everyone else living in the corpse is forced out as well, leaving them to figure out how to survive in the woods. Aurora takes leadership and begins helping everyone she can by gathering food and providing company. She befriends the narcissistic Zelie, who has a group of loyal followers that worship and spoil her. Aurora's naivety makes her blind to the fact that she is a victim of Zelie's manipulation. Hector, who was seemingly infatuated with Aurora, marries Zelie unexpectedly and Aurora is left alone. Her closest friends become part of Zelie's following. The betrayal strips Aurora of her sympathy and purity; her only goal from then on is to survive, no matter what the cost. Aurora comes across a giant's cabin, where she can live without the others. Eventually, Zelie and her posse discover this cabin as well and make themselves at home. Aurora desperately wants them out of her new home, so she tricks them into gathering under a stove and watches as the giant unknowingly burns them alive. Finally, she can live in peace.

It has four to six linear leaves at its base and up to six yellow flowers with reddish brown markings. It grows in swampy places south of Perth. Description Diuris micrantha is a tuberous, perennial herb with between four and six linear leaves, each leaf long and wide in a loose tuft at the base. Up to six yellow flowers with reddish brown markings, about long and wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal curves upwards and is narrow egg-shaped, long and about wide. The lateral sepals are linear, green and purplish, long, about wide, turned downwards and parallel to each other. The petals are more or less erect, spread apart from each other with a broadly egg-shaped to almost round blade long and wide on a reddish-brown stalk long. There is a distinct reddish brown blotch near the tip of the petals. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is egg- shaped to wedge-shaped, wide and the side lobes are linear to egg-shaped, long and about wide. There are two parallel, reddish brown, ridge-like calli about long near the mid-line of the base of the labellum. Flowering occurs in September and October. Taxonomy and naming Diuris micrantha was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected in Mandogalup, and the description was published in Australian Orchid Review. The specific epithet (micrantha) is derived from the Ancient Greek words mikros meaning \\"small\\" or \\"little\\" and anthos meaning \\"flower\\", referring to the small flowers of this orchid. Distribution and habitat The dwarf bee orchid grows with dense sedges in swampy place between Perth and Boyup Brook in the Jarrah Forest and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions. Conservation Diuris micrantha is classified as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as \\"Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora — Extant)\\" by the Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia).

The music festival hosted more than 200,000 people over the summer. The Pool Parties featured a diverse range of artists such as Aesop Rock, Beach House, Black Lips, Blonde Redhead, Cap'n Jazz, Chromeo, Cut Copy, Dan Deacon, Deerhoof, Dirty Projectors, Dr. Dog, Grizzly Bear, The Hold Steady, MGMT, Mission of Burma, Superchunk, Ted Leo and the Pharmacists, The Walkmen, and !!!.  History  = McCarren Park = McCarren Pool is an olympic-size swimming pool in Greenpoint, Brooklyn that open in 1936. In 1984 the pool was closed due to lack of funding and racial tensions. In 2004 choreographer Noémie Lafrance requested permission from the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation to use the derelict pool as a performance space. Lafrance chose the space as she resided nearby and wanted \\"this space for community use for other performances and for it to be used as an experimental space where people can develop site-specific ideas.\\" Lafrance was able get to permission by raising funds and a donation of $200,000 from Live Nation but controversy arose as Lafrance and community activists objected to Live Nation's plans for paid concerts using the public space for private profit. = 2006–2007 = In response to the controversy the Parks Department permitted a series of free performances. On July 9, 2006 music promoter JellyNYC got involved through Lafrance and hosted Les Savy Fav for a free concert on a makeshift stage to a crowd of 3,000 people. It soon became considered one of the best music series in New York City for its good sight lines and ability to hold 5,500 people. In addition to the music, drinks, and food the Pool Parties activities included dodgeball, Slip 'N Slides, and hula hooping. = 2008 = In 2008 the Open Space Alliance for North Brooklyn won a bid to host concerts from the Parks Department and contracted with JellyNYC as they had produced the Pool Parties for two summers. The cost of the 2008 season grew to $750,000 to cover the free shows that was largely covered by corporate sponsorship. After the first summer of their collaboration the Pool Parties had to either end or find a new space as New York City decided to restore the space back to a functional swimming pool which would prevent future summer concerts. The final free show at McCarren was on August 24, 2008 where members of Yo La Tengo symbolically poured five one-gallon jugs of water from the stage into the pool. = Move to East River Park = = 2009 = For the 2009 season the Pool Parties were moved to East River Park, which at the time was a slab of asphalt and grass along the East River next to luxury condominiums. The move brought many challenges to the Pool Parties. JellyNYC stated that the move meant a doubling of their site fees, along with the loss of revenue from beer sales and increased security demands that made the concerts much harder to produce profitably. The economic climate made it more difficult to get enough corporate sponsorships to keep the concert series free. The Slip 'N Slides were replaced with children's wading pools for safety reasons but were eventually also prohibited as there were no lifeguards on duty. The site was administered by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation that had greater restrictions than the City Parks Department and were hesitant to renew the contract for 2010 until Sen. Chuck Schumer advocated for their continuation. The State Parks Department were concerned about security and safety violations including a partial stage collapse during a Girl Talk set. = 2010 = In the second season at East River State Park the Open Space Alliance and JellyNYC engaged in a public dispute over $31,000 that threatened to cancel the August 29, 2010 show featuring Delorean and Dominique Young Unique that was resolved by donations from local property owners to the Alliance. The deterioration of the relationship was reported to be because of money, differences of opinion in event management, band choices and weaker attendance after the move. For the final show on August 29 there was a series of special guests including Big Freedia, The Cool Kids, Doug E. Fresh, Andrew W.K., D.M.C., Gucci Mane, and the lead singer from the inaugural concert Tim Harrington. = 2011 = In 2011, JellyNYC tried a rebranded series of concerts in the spirit of the Pool Parties in various locations including Aviator Sports Complex and East Williamsburg but were unable to obtain the sponsorships or crowds to sustain them.

The service was launched in Los Angeles, California during 2016 by actor Chuck McCarthy when he was in-between acting jobs and needed money. He initially advertised the business by posting fliers asking questions like “Need Motivation to walk”, “Scared to walk alone at night?”, “Don’t like walking alone at all?”, and “Don’t want people to see you walking alone and just assume you have no friends?”, which led to people contacting him to schedule walks. McCarthy describes the walks as “therapeutic” for both him and his clients. After receiving a large number of requests, McCarthy hired more walkers and began offering more locations.  Website  On their website, the mission of The People Walker is further explained. They explain why they walk, why sitting is dangerous for the body, the physical benefits of walking, the mental benefits of walking, and the personal benefits of walking. The website also lists the profiles of the available walkers for hire, which includes a video of the walker introducing themselves.

Few members of this gens are mentioned in ancient writers, but a number are known from inscriptions.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 686 (\\"Sabidius\\").

Coradgery located at 32°48′54″S 148°00′04″ is a rural locality of Parkes Shire situated near the Bogan River, in New South Wales, Australia. The first freehold land leases were granted in September 1848, the first four including Coradgery (the others being Coobang, Burrawang, and Gunningbland). By December 1849, the property was sought to be owned by gentlemen Bray and Palmer. It was given to be 20 030 acres and capable of hosting 750 head of cattle. By 1859, it was brothers George and John Palmer, who used as cattle brands an upside-down 'GP', and a '-B'. The cattle were 'store cattle' indicating the property was used for breeding and fattening before being sold for market. By 1874 however the property was stocked with 6000 sheep. Later the property would be owned by the Balcombe family, principally Herbert Henty Balcombe (d. October 1941). Well known for its racehorse breeding, the property had a race track, trotting track and a polo field. Its picnic races often drew two-thousand people. Balcombe sold the property in 1920. Balcombe and the property were mentioned by Scottish Border poet and Australian bush balladeer Will H. Ogilvie in his 1897 poem For the honor Old England, and the glory of the game (A history of international polo.). The polo match included a captain of Australian commerce, (H)ugh Victor Foy, the poet himself, as well as Breaker Morant. The poem, given to be based on a true event, was written after Banjo Paterson's 1893 poem The Geebung Polo Club. At one time the area had the Coradgery and District Progress Association, a race club, and T. Farnsworth was the proprietor of the hotel.

The wrecked hull of the Lizzie Throop was discovered in the summer of 2016, while searching for the lost airliner Northwest Airlines Flight 2501. Vessel Built by J. O'Conner, in what was previously known as Mill Point, Michigan, the wooden vessel was crafted out of timbers milled from one of Grand Haven's earliest saw mills. The single deck schooner was constructed to a length of 86 feet (26 meters), a breadth of 21 feet (6.4 meters), with a depth of 8 feet (2.5 meters). She displaced 123 tons. The vessel had an almost 4:1 ratio in length and width, giving the ship an unusual wide appearance. She could be operated by a crew of 6 to 8 men. The ship's namesake comes from a derivative of the ship owner, Nathan Throop's deceased wife, Caroline Elizabeth Throop. History on the Great Lakes The Lizzie Throop encountered some misfortunes on the lakes in her quarter century on the lakes. Two grounding events occurred in 1854. According to insurance claims, in April, 1854, she was driven against breakwater, near Chicago, Illinois. She ran aground again that same year, in November. In 1865, her tonnage was reduced to 97 tons and her cargo hold was outfitted to carry timbers, logged from Northern Michigan. Towards the end of her life, she ran regular routes from Muskegon to Chicago, carrying timbers to the rebuilding metropolis of the Midwest that was recovering from the Great Chicago Fire. Loss On October 16, 1873, the Throop left Muskegon with a load of wood slabs at dusk. Around 11 P.M. she was encountered by a squall. At 3am her hull sprang a leak and started taking on water. The surviving first mate recounted his story \\"At 1pm, she filled with water up to her decks. At this time we were away from land about fifteen miles. At half past 6pm, she rolled over. The men took to the rigging except the mate, who steered her until she rolled over. Three of the men got into the boat, the Captain and cook having before this washed off and drowned. The three men, including the mate, left the boat and got into the hull and made a line fast to the boat and let her hang to the hull. The vessel began to break up and the three men were washed off of her. One was drowned, and the other two got ashore on a piece of the wreck.\\" The Lizzie Throop's deck separated from the hull, due to the buoyancy force of the wood slabs in the cargo hold, and the ship taking on water and beginning to sink. The wood slabs pushed up through the strained decking, sending the hull to the bottom of Lake Michigan. What remained of the decking washed ashore hours later, nearly nine miles north of Grand Haven, with 4 of the sailors aboard. Two sailors, being Captain Mcmara and the cook, went down with the Throop. Discovery of the wreck SideScan sonar expert Ralph Wilbanks, working with Michigan Shipwreck Research Associates, on behalf of Clive Cussler, while searching for a missing airliner that disappeared in 1950, was using side-scan sonar, when an image appeared of what looked like an early wooden sailing ship. The Throop was always believed to have all washed ashore, but the MSRA team discovered by studying the wreck's dimensions, that the image was indeed the hull of the Lizzie Throop. The Wreck lies in 280 feet (85 meters) of water, 15 miles (24 kilometers) northwest of South Haven. Wilbanks and his team also were responsible in locating the H.L. Hunley Confederate submarine.

Homer and Marge start narrating the story of how they lived there before getting married, and as soon as they observe their old apartment, the couple invite the kids to visit it. They meet the new engaged owners of the accommodation, who give Marge their mail. They continue to tell their story to the owners, explaining how Marge was a photographer working for a news company led by J.J. Gruff while Homer worked at a new company called Flashmouth. They often went partying, watching movies and watching the starry sky on top of a car, but after Bart was born, their careers and lifestyles went downhill. Homer lost his job and Marge was threatened by J.J. Gruff to be replaced by Booberella if Marge didn't get a new nightlife story. Marge interviewed John Baldessari for an article, but Homer and Bart entered the gallery after Bart drove the car on a ferry while Homer was sleeping, and he started making pranks.

The Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data breach was a data leak whereby millions of Facebook users' personal data was harvested without consent by Cambridge Analytica, predominantly to be used for political advertising. It is the largest known leak in Facebook history. The data was collected through an app created in 2013 by Dr. Aleksandr Kogan (Dr. Aleksandr Spectre, at the time), a Cambridge academic, and consisted of a series of questions to build psychological profiles on users. The app not only harvested the personal data of the users that completed the questions, but also of the users’ Facebook friends. Cambridge Analytica sought to sell the data of American voters to political campaigns and ultimately provided assistance and analytics to the Ted Cruz and Donald Trump campaigns. The data breach was disclosed in 2018 by Christopher Wylie, a former Cambridge Analytica employee, in interviews with The Guardian and The New York Times. In response, Facebook apologized for their role in the data harvesting and their CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in front of Congress. These happenings sparked an online movement #DeleteFacebook, which trended on Twitter. The Russo brothers are producing an upcoming film on the scandal.  Sequence of events  A data scientist at Cambridge University, Aleksandr Kogan, was hired by Cambridge Analytica, an offshoot of SCL Group, to develop an app called \\"This Is Your Digital Life\\" (sometimes stylized as \\"thisisyourdigitallife\\") in 2014. He provided the app to Cambridge Analytica, who in turn arranged an informed consent process for research in which several hundred thousand Facebook users would agree to complete a survey for payment that was only for academic use. However, Facebook allowed this app not only to collect personal information from survey respondents but also from respondents’ Facebook friends. In this way, Cambridge Analytica acquired data from millions of Facebook users. The harvesting of personal data by Cambridge Analytica was first reported in December 2015 by Harry Davies, a journalist for The Guardian. He reported that Cambridge Analytica was working for United States Senator Ted Cruz using data harvested from millions of people's Facebook accounts without their consent. Further reports followed in December 2016 by Hannes Grasseger and Mikael Krogerus for the Swiss publication Das Magazin (later translated and published by Vice), in February 2017 by Carole Cadwalladr for The Guardian (starting in February 2017), and in March 2017 by Mattathias Schwartz for The Intercept. Information on the data breach came to a head in March 2018 with the emergence of a whistleblower, an ex-Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie. He had been an anonymous source for an article in 2017 in The Observer by Cadwalladr, headlined \\"The Great British Brexit Robbery\\". Cadwalladr worked with Wylie for a year to coax him to come forward as a whistleblower. She later brought in Channel 4 News in the UK and The New York Times due to legal threats against The Guardian and The Observer by Cambridge Analytica. The Guardian and The New York Times published articles simultaneously on March 17, 2018. More than $100 billion was knocked off Facebook's market capitalization in days and politicians in the US and UK demanded answers from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The negative public response to the media coverage eventually led to him agreeing to testify in front of the United States Congress. Data characteristics = Numbers = Wired, The New York Times, and The Observer reported that the data-set had included information on 50 million Facebook users. While Cambridge Analytica claimed it had only collected 30 million Facebook user profiles, Facebook later confirmed that it actually had data on potentially over 87 million users, with 70.6 million of those people from the United States. Facebook estimated that California was the most affected U.S. state, with 6.7 million impacted users, followed by Texas, with 5.6 million, and Florida, with 4.3 million. Data was collected on 87 million users while only 270,000 people downloaded the app. = Information = Facebook sent a message to those users believed to be affected, saying the information likely included one's \\"public profile, page likes, birthday and current city.\\" Some of the app's users gave the app permission to access their News Feed, timeline, and messages. The data was detailed enough for Cambridge Analytica to create psychographic profiles of the subjects of the data. The data also included the locations of each person. For a given political campaign, each profile's information suggested what type of advertisement would be most effective to persuade a particular person in a particular location for some political event. Data use Political events for which politicians paid Cambridge Analytica to use information from the data breach include the following: =Ted Cruz campaign= Ted Cruz Campaign In 2016, Ted Cruz hired Cambridge Analytica to aid his presidential campaign. The Federal Election Commission reported that Cruz paid the company $5.8 million in services. Although Cambridge Analytica was not well-known at the time, this is when it started to create individual psychographic profiles. This data was then used to create tailored advertisements for each person to sway them into voting for Cruz. =Donald Trump campaign= Donald Trump Campaign Slogan Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign utilized the harvest data to build psychographic profiles, determining users' personality traits based on their Facebook activity. The campaign team used this information as a micro-targeting technique, displaying customized messages about Trump to different US voters on various digital platforms. Ads were segmented into different categories, mainly based on whether individuals were Trump supporters or potential swing votes. Supporters of Trump received triumphant visuals of him, as well as information regarding polling stations. Swing voters were instead often shown images of Trump’s more notable supporters and negative graphics or ideas about his opponent, Hillary Clinton. For example, the collected data was specifically used by “Make America Number 1 Super PAC” to attack Clinton through constructed advertisements that attempted to highlight the corruption of Clinton as a way of propping up Trump as a better candidate for presidency. =Potential usage= Russia In 2018, the Parliament of the United Kingdom questioned SCL Group director Alexander Nix in a hearing about Cambridge Analytica’s connections with Russian oil company, Lukoil. Nix stated he had no connections to the two companies despite concerns that the oil company was interested in how the company's data was used to target American voters. Cambridge Analytica had become a point of focus in politics since its involvement in Trump's campaign at this point. Democratic officials made it a point of emphasis for improved investigation over concerns of Russian ties with Cambridge Analytica. It was later confirmed by Christopher Wylie that Lukoil was interested in the company’s data regarding political targeting. Brexit Cambridge Analytica was allegedly hired as a consultant company for Leave.EU and the United Kingdom Independence Party during 2016, as an effort to convince people to support Brexit. These rumors were the result of the leaked internal emails that were sent between the British firm and the British parliament. Brittany Kaiser declared that the datasets that Leave.EU utilize to create databases were provided by Cambridge Analytica. These datasets composed of the data obtained from Facebook were said to be work done as an initial job deliverable for them. Although Arron Banks, co-founder of Leave.EU, denied any involvement with the company, he later declared “When we said we’d hired Cambridge Analytica, maybe a better choice of words could have been deployed.\\" Media coverage In December 2015, The Guardian reported that Cambridge Analytica used the data at the behest of Ted Cruz. According to PolitiFact, Trump paid Cambridge Analytica in September, October, and November for data on Americans and their political preferences. On March 17, 2018, The Observer and The New York Times broke the story simultaneously. Kogan's recent name change to Aleksandr Spectre, which resulted in the ominous \\"Dr. Spectre,\\" added to the intrigue and popular appeal of the story. The Observer worked with Christopher Wylie, a former employee of Cambridge Analytica, for more than a year before bringing in The New York Times to report the story in the US. Meghan McCain has drawn an equivalence between the use of data by Cambridge Analytica and Barack Obama's 2012 presidential campaign.\\"Funny, When Obama Harvested Facebook Data On Millions Of Users To Win In 2012, Everyone Cheered\\". Investor's Business Daily. March 19, 2018.\\"Why Are We Only Now Talking About Facebook And Elections?\\". Forbes. March 19, 2018.\\"Former Facebook staffer, Obama campaign boss reveal concerns about Facebook data\\". News.com.au. March 21, 2018. This data was not used in an unethical way, however, according to PolitiFact. Obama's campaign used this data to “have their supporters contact their most persuadable friends” rather than using this data for highly targeted digital ads on websites such as Facebook. = The Great Hack (2019) = The Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal also received media coverage in the form of a 2019 Netflix documentary, The Great Hack. This is the first feature-length media piece that ties together the various elements of the scandal through a narrative. The documentary provides information on the background information and events related to Cambridge Analytica, Facebook, and the 2016 election that resulted in the overall data scandal. The Great Hack communicates the experiences and personal journeys of multiple individuals that were involved in the event in different ways and through different relationships. These individuals include David Carroll, Brittany Kaiser, and more. David Carroll is a New York professor in the field of media that attempted to navigate the legal system in order to discover what data Cambridge Analytica had in possession about him. Meanwhile, Brittany Kaiser is a former Cambridge Analytica employee that ultimately became a whistleblower for the data scandal. Responses = Facebook and other companies = Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg first apologized for the situation with Cambridge Analytica on CNN, calling it an \\"issue\\", a \\"mistake\\" and a \\"breach of trust\\". He explained that he was responding to the Facebook community’s concerns and that the company’s initial focus on data portability had shifted to locking down data; he also reminded the platform’s users of their right of access to personal data. Other Facebook officials argued against calling it a \\"data breach,\\" arguing those who took the personality quiz originally consented to give away their information. Zuckerberg pledged to make changes and reforms in Facebook policy to prevent similar breaches. On March 25, 2018, Zuckerberg published a personal letter in various newspapers apologizing on behalf of Facebook. In April, Facebook decided to implement the EU's General Data Protection Regulation in all areas of operation and not just the EU. In April 2018, Facebook established Social Science One as a response to the event. On April 25, 2018, Facebook released their first earnings report since the scandal was reported. Revenue fell since the last quarter, but this is usual as it followed the holiday season quote. The quarter revenue was the highest for a first quarter, and the second overall. Amazon said that they suspended Cambridge Analytica from using their Amazon Web Services when they learned in 2015 that their service was collecting personal information. The Italian banking company UniCredit stopped advertising and marketing on Facebook in August 2018. = Governmental actions = The governments of India and Brazil demanded that Cambridge Analytica report how anyone used data from the breach in political campaigning, and various regional governments in the United States have lawsuits in their court systems from citizens affected by the data breach. In early July 2018, the United Kingdom's Information Commissioner's Office announced it intended to fine Facebook £500,000 ($663,000) over the data breach, this being the maximum fine allowed at the time of the breach, saying Facebook \\"contravened the law by failing to safeguard people's information\\". In March 2019, a court filing by the U.S. Attorney General for the District of Columbia alleged that Facebook knew of Cambridge Analytica's \\"improper data-gathering practices\\" months before they were first publicly reported in December 2015. In July 2019, the Federal Trade Commission voted to approve fining Facebook around $5 billion to finally settle the investigation into the data breach, with a 3-2 vote. = Impact on Facebook users and investors = Since April 2018, the first full month since the breaking of the Cambridge Analytica data breach, the number of likes, posts and shares on the site had decreased by almost 20%, and has decreased ever since, with the aforementioned activity only momentarily increasing during the summer and during the 2018 US midterm elections. Despite this, user growth of the site has increased in the period since increased media coverage, increasing by 1.8% during the final quarter of 2018. On March 26, 2018, a little after a week after the story was initially published, Facebook stock fell by about 24%, equivalent to $134 billion. By May 10, Wall Street reported that the company recovered their losses. = #DeleteFacebook movement = Brittany Kaiser The public reacted to the data privacy breach by initiating the campaign #DeleteFacebook with the aim of starting a movement to boycott Facebook. The co-founder of WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, joined in on the movement by declaring it was time to delete the platform. The hashtag was tweeted almost 400,000 times Twitter within a 30 day period after news of the data breach. 93% of the mentions of the hashtag actually appeared on Twitter, making it the main social media platform used to share the hashtag.Data source: Google Trends (https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2018-01-01%202020-01-01&geo;=US&q;=%23deletefacebook) However, a survey by investment firm Raymond James found that although approximately 84% of Facebook users were concerned about how the app used their data, about 48% of those surveyed claimed they wouldn’t actually cut back on their usage of the social media network. Additionally, in 2018, Mark Zuckerberg commented that he didn’t think the company had seen \\"a meaningful number of people act\\" on deleting Facebook. An additional campaign and hashtag, #OwnYourData, was coined by Brittany Kaiser. The hashtag was created by Kaiser as a Facebook campaign that pushed for increased transparency on the platform. #OwnYourData was also used in Kaiser's petition for Facebook to alter their policies and give users increased power and control over their data, which she refers to as users’ assets and property. In addition to the hashtag, Kaiser also created the Own Your Data Foundation to promote increased digital intelligence education.  Witness and expert testimony  The United States Senate Judiciary Committee called witnesses to testify about the data breach and general data privacy. They held two hearings, one focusing on Facebook's role in the breach and privacy on social media, and the other on Cambridge Analytica's role and its impact in data privacy. The former was held on April 10, 2018, where Mark Zuckerberg testified and Senator Chuck Grassley and Senator Diane Feinstein gave statements. The latter occurred on May 16, 2018, where Professor Eitan Hersh, Dr. Mark Jamison, and Christopher Wylie testified, while Senators Grassley and Feinstein again made statements. = Eitan Hersh = In 2015, Professor Eitan Hersh published Hacking the Electorate: How Campaigns Perceive Voters, which analyzed the databases used for campaigns between 2008 and 2014. On May 6, 2018, Eitan Hersh, a professor of political science at Tufts University testified before Congress as an expert on voter targeting. Hersh claimed that the voter targeting by Cambridge Analytica did not excessively affect the outcome of the 2016 election because the techniques used by Cambridge Analytica were similar to those of presidential campaigns well before 2016. Further, he claimed that the correlation between user “likes” and personality traits were weak and thus the psychological profiling of users were also weak. = Mark Jamison = Dr. Mark Jamison, the director and Gunter Professor of the Public Utility Research Center at the University of Florida, testified before Congress on May 6, 2018 as an expert. Jamison reiterated that it was not unusual for presidential campaigns to use data like Facebook’s data to profile voters; Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush also used models to micro-target voters. Jamison criticized Facebook for not being “clear and candid with its users” because the users were not aware of the extent that their data would be used. Jamison finished his testimony by saying that if the federal government were to regulate voter targeting to happen on sites like Facebook, it would harm the users of those sites because it would be too restrictive of those sites and would make things worse for regulators. = Christopher Wylie = Christopher Wylie during Cambridge Analytica protest. On May 16, 2018, Christopher Wylie, who is considered the “whistleblower” on Cambridge Analytica and also served as Cambridge Analytica’s Director of Research in 2013 and 2014, also testified to the United States Senate Judiciary Committee. He was considered a witness to both British and American authorities, and he claims he decided to whistle-blow to “protect democratic institutions from rogue actors and hostile foreign interference, as well as ensure the safety of Americans online.” He claimed that at Cambridge Analytica “anything goes” and that Cambridge Analytica was “a corrupting force in the world.” He detailed to Congress how Cambridge Analytica used Facebook’s data to categorize people into groups based on political ideology. He also claimed that Eitan Hersh contradicted “copious amounts of peer-reviewed literature in top scientific journals, including the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, Psychological Science, and Journal of Personality and Individual Differences” by saying that Facebook’s categorizing of people were weak. Christopher Wylie also testified about Russian contact with Cambridge Analytica and the campaign, voter disengagement, and his thoughts on Facebook’s response. = Mark Zuckerberg = During his testimony before Congress on April 10, 2018, Mark Zuckerberg said it was his personal mistake that he did not do enough to prevent Facebook from being used for harm. “That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections and hate speech.” During the testimony, Mark Zuckerberg publicly apologized for the breach of private data: “It was my mistake, and I’m sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and I’m responsible for what happens here.” Zuckerberg said that in 2013 researcher Aleksandr Kogan from Cambridge University had created a personality quiz app, which was installed by 300,000 people. The app was then able to retrieve Facebook information, including that of the users' friends, and this was obtained by Kogan. It was not until 2015 that Zuckerberg learned that these users' information was shared by Kogan with Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica was subsequently asked to remove all the data. It was later discovered by The Guardian, The New York Times and Channel 4 that the data had in fact not been deleted.

At the end of 1909, Wilbur R. Kimball bought Dr. William Greene's 1909 biplane and took it to Rahway, New Jersey where he and Frank Boland removed the tail and began experimenting with a novel control system that eventually led to the first Boland Brothers 'jibbed' tailless biplane.  Design and development  Frank Boland was convinced that a traditional tail rudder and ailerons/wing warping was unnecessary to provide lateral control for an airplane. He started experimenting with different control mechanisms in 1908. More enthusiastic and daring than skilled engineer, Boland and Kimball spent 1910 experimenting with, crashing and rebuilding the Greene biplane while they worked out and refined what Boland called the 'jibbed' control. The resulting airplane was very easy to fly. To go left or right, you would turn the wheel in the direction you wished to go and up and down was controlled by pushing and pulling on the control wheel. From a description of his flight in Mineola, Long Island in 1911: \\"There is no grandstand play about Boland's flying. He just gets in the machine and off he goes turning as he leaves the ground, if he likes, which no other aviator thinks of doing. He just imagines himself in an automobile and drives accordingly. He says he never bothers about lateral balance or other minor things like that.\\" Boland was very much into the adventure of discovery and flying. Appearance was of little concern to him. A quote from the same article describes the condition of his aircraft: \\"No attempt has been made to refine the machine, to have nicely finished woodwork, or neat sockets and turnbuckles.The cloth is rusty from the weather and has been on for about a year, part of the time no shed being provided for the machine at all—he just leaves it out like a lazy farmer would his plow. Some ribs have one curve, some another, sometimes they are flat, due to weather conditions. Out under the elevator hang four sash weights which some time in the past aided the housewife to raise her kitchen window. All Boland wants to do is fly and he doesn't care a hang for looks.\\"  Wing Jib Control  Drawing of the Boland 'jib' from Aeronautics magazine From Aeronautics magazine Nov. 1911 issue describing the operation of the wing jib control illustrated on the right: \\"According to Mr. Boland, the operation of the machine is the same as that of an automobile, with the exception of the elevator which works in the accepted manner. In order to turn to the left the wheel is turned to the left, the machine swinging around easily and banking itself properly. When the turn is complete the wheel is brought back to center and \\"that's all there is to it\\". The jibs are triangular in shape with a balancing portion, and are pivoted at the points A and B as shown in this sketch, the wire C from the wheel going to the lower corner. When the wheel is turned, the lower corner of the jib is pulled in, thus presenting an obliquely inclined surface, offering resistance on that side.\\"  Specifications  3 view drawing of the Boland biplane from Nov. 1911 Aeronautics magazine  References   External links  * Category:1910s United States experimental aircraft Category:Single-engined pusher aircraft Category:Canard aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1911 Category:Boland aircraft ","title":"Boland 1911 Tailless Biplane"},{"id":"56943844","text":"John L.

It was, along with Tiger Lily Records one of the major tax scam labels, releasing around hundred albums. History Guinness Records was established in 1977 by Marvin L. Popkin as a tax shelter based around the idea of investing in a master recording that would be greatly over valued so that the investors could claim a tax loss when the deliberately under-promoted album failed to sell. Most recordings were sourced from recording studio vaults and published as albums without the knowledge or consent of the performers. Several defunct bands are known to have had releases as a result of this practice, but the most high profile performers identified were Detroit area band The Rockets, Atlantic Starr, who had two unauthorized albums based on demo tapes released under their original name, Newban, independent musician R. Stevie Moore, who had a trio of demos released on an album attributed to a group called Hotgun, and The Vibrations, whose producer Robert John Gallo, provided the masters of the band's final album to Guinness Records, along with several other sets of masters, some unreleased, he had produced for other performers. The types of albums released by Guinness fell into three broad categories: * Single band/artist albums based on unpublished material. (e.g. \\"Rockets\\", \\"Snowball\\") * Compilation albums based on unpublished material disguised as the debut album of a single band. (e.g. \\"Hotgun\\", \\"Living on Giving\\") * Bootleg re-issues of albums previously published on obscure labels. (e.g. \\"Sum Pear\\", \\"Good Vibrations\\") Throughout its short existence, the label was closely associated with another tax scam label Dellwood Records, believed to be linked to Prelude Records, which acted as Guinness Records distributor.

Background Abyan was a stronghold for AQAP at the beginning of the civil war. AQAP was beginning to take pieces of southern Abyan in late 2016, when they captured Zinjibar and other towns. An internal crisis erupted in Abyan between the legitimate AQAP emir, Tawfiq Belaidi (brother of the late AQAP emir Hamza al-Zinjibari) and another AQAP warlord named Abu Anas al-Sanani, over who would succeed Hamza. It is unclear who won the day, but the conflict killed 7 and wounded 9. Clashes and other incidents On February 21 AQAP militants withdrew from Ahwar city, after a failed attempt to consolidate control. AQAP militants attacked a popular resistance checkpoint, killing three, before erecting their own checkpoints and flying al-Qaeda’s flag from government buildings. Militiamen from the Bakazim tribe massed outside Ahwar in response. AQAP agreed to withdraw under the terms of a tribal mediation allowing the group free passage through the city. On March 8 AQAP gunmen abducted government official Haidara Daha at al Musaymir, west of Zinjibar. AQAP was consolidating control in Abyan governorate and targeted local leaders and officials opposed to its expansion. On March 26–27, three US drone strikes killed eight AQAP members and three beekeepers in Al Mahfad District. Two Saudi planes launched rockets into an old office of the local government in Zinjibar, setting the building on fire. 10 AQAP fighters were believed to be killed. On April 8 more than 35 Hadi Yemeni government soldiers were captured by AQAP soldiers in Ahwar. 17-20+ of them were executed by firing squad. The others were wounded but still alive, while others were believed to have escaped and reached safety. The soldiers were travelling from Aden to Al Mahrah Governorate via Ahwar, and were ambushed while passing Ahwar. On April 9 AQAP denied that its fighters executed the soldiers, blaming a local fighter named Ali Aqel. \\"We entered Ahwar around two months ago to chase this corrupt individual and his gang,\\" the statement said. On April 14 an airstrike hit an AQAP checkpoint in the Al Kawd, killing 10 AQAP militants. tribal fighters loyal to Hadi ambushed an AQAP convoy in Mafhad, killing 3, including a commander, Amjad al-Wahti.

Kaligis, is an Indonesian lawyer serving a 10-year jail sentence for bribing judges. Prominent cases =Setya Novanto and Bank Bali case= Kaligis represented deputy Golkar Party treasurer Setya Novanto when he was charged in August 1999 in connection with the Bank Bali scandal. The Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA) had in February 1999 colluded with Golkar officials to force Bank Bali chief Rudy Ramli to pay Rp546 billion to Setya's company Era Giat Prima (EGP) in order to collect Rp904 billion owed by three banks taken over by IBRA. The money was then paid out in more than 150 transfers to politicians and legislators, partly in an effort to buy votes for the re-election of then-president B.J. Habibie. Setya, who was part of Habibie's re-election team, was never prosecuted over the case. =Sex tapes porn trial= Kaligis represented Nazril \\"Ariel\\" Irham, lead singer of the band Peterpan, who was in January 2011 convicted of pornography and sentenced to three years and six months in jail over sex tapes made with his celebrity girlfriends Luna Maya and Cut Tari. =Omni Hospital misdiagnosis= In 2009, Kaligis represented Prita Mulyasari, who was sued by Omni International Hospital in Tangerang, west of Jakarta, for defamation. Prita had written an email complaining the hospital had misdiagnosed her case of mumps as dengue fever. Omni reported Prita to police and she arrested. Judges dismissed the case, so Omni Hospital filed a civil case and Prita was ordered to pay Rp312 million in damages. When Prita appealed, the High Court upheld the decision. The Supreme Court overturned the damages verdict. In July 2011, Omni Hospital appealed the criminal case to the Supreme Court, which issued a guilty verdict and a suspended sentence. In September 2012 the Supreme Court overturned its guilty verdict. Kaligis defended Prita pro bono. =Nazaruddin SEA Games bribery= Kaligis represented Muhammad Nazaruddin, the Democratic Party's former treasurer, who was in 2012 sentenced to four years and 10 months in jail for corruption. Nazaruddin, who had fled to Singapore and was arrested in Colombia, was convicted of accepting bribes for construction tenders for the 2011 South East Asian Games hosted by Indonesia. The Supreme Court in 2013 increased Nazaruddin's sentence to seven years. He also received a six-year sentence for money laundering. Kaligis in 2012 claimed he was still representing Nazaruddin, but rival lawyer Hotman Paris Hutapea said Kaligis had been dismissed. =JIS alleged child abuse cases= Kaligis in 2014 represented an Indonesian woman who claimed her son was raped by cleaners in a toilet block at Jakarta International School (JIS, later renamed Jakarta Intercultural School). Kaligis accused JIS of tampering with evidence by firing the cleaners and renovating the toilet block. When the mother failed to obtain compensation because JIS was not liable for the cleaners, she declared two teachers at the school had also abused her son. South Jakarta District Court in April 2015 sentenced the teachers to 10 years in jail. They were acquitted by Jakarta High Court in August 2015. The Supreme Court in February 2016 overturned the acquittal and increased the sentences to 11 years. Kaligis also represented the mother in a failed 2015 effort to sue JIS for $125 million. Jailed for bribery On 17 December 2015, Kaligis was sentenced to five years and six months in jail for bribing a clerk and three judges at Medan State Administrative Court (PTUN Medan) in North Sumatra province. Kaligis made the bribes through his subordinate, Gerry Baskara, providing Judge Tripeni Irianto Putro with S$5,000 and US$15,000; Judge Germawan Ginting and Amir Fauzi with $5,000 each; and a clerk with $2,000. The bribes were paid in an effort to influence a case involving alleged corruption by North Sumatra governor Gatot Pujo Nugroho and his wife, Evi Susanti. Jakarta High Court in June 2016 increased his sentence to seven years. The Supreme Court in August 2016 increased the sentence to eight years.

In 1997, Halat was convicted for his involvement in a criminal conspiracy which led to the murders of Vincent Sherry, Halat's former law partner and a Mississippi judge, and Sherry's wife Margaret, a Biloxi city councilwoman, ten years previously. He was found guilty and sentenced to 18 years in prison, of which he served 15. Pete Halat was elected mayor in 1989 and lost a re-election bid in 1993. The FBI investigation (led by agent Keith Bell, now retired) eventually ended the city's long tolerance for wide open, illegal gambling and striptease clubs with allegedly exorbitantly priced drinks. Biloxi is now home to legal casino resort hotels, with 24-hour gambling, concert entertainment shows and restaurants.\\"Tentative re-opening plans for Biloxi casino resorts\\" (2006), City of Biloxi, www.Biloxi.ms.us, webpage:Biloxi-Casinos.Margaritaville Casino closes in Biloxi Retrieved 2014-11-02 Some Biloxi casinos. History Pete Halat and Vincent Sherry became law partners in 1981. Sherry was appointed a circuit judge in 1986. =Dixie Mafia killings= Kirksey Nix was involved in the 1987 murder-for-hire killing of Judge Sherry and Margaret (both 58) in Biloxi. In the hopes of earning enough money to bribe his way out of prison, Nix was running a dating scam targeting homosexual men, where he would pose as a gay single man and entice them into a relationship, frequently by sending sexually explicit photos cut out from magazines, only to concoct fictitious stories for needing money, such as being in trouble with the law and having to pay hefty legal expenses, and needing additional money so he could move in with them. The operation was run from both Nix's prison cell in Louisiana and Sherry law office, which at the time was Pete Halat's legal office, by Nix's girlfriend Sheri LaRa Sharpe after Vincent Sherry left to become a judge. Nix's co-conspirator Halat had stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars from Nix to cover financial difficulties and blamed it on Vincent Sherry. Kirksey Nix believed his claim and ordered the deaths of Judge Sherry and his wife. Thomas Holcomb was hired by Nix to murder the couple in their home. =Conviction= On October 23, 1996, Halat was indicted on federal charges related to his involvement in the 1987 murders of Vincent and Margaret Sherry. At the time the FBI believed that the two were killed on Halat's orders after he thought that Judge Sherry was stealing from a bank account Halat kept for an imprisoned client, which held funds from Kirksey Nix's \\"Lonely Hearts\\" dating scam targeting gay men. It would later turn out however, that Vincent Sherry had never stolen money from Kirksey Nix's dating scam and that it was in fact Pete Halat himself who had stolen upwards of $100,000 U.S. dollars from the Lonely Hearts scam. When Nix was enraged over noticing the amount of missing money and arranged for Pete Halat to visit him in prison and demanded an explanation from him, Halat quickly blamed Judge Sherry for the theft of the illicit funds and the two quietly agreed to have Judge Sherry and his wife murdered. Shortly thereafter, Kirksey Nix ordered the deaths of Vincent and Margaret Sherry for the alleged theft of his money, and the Dixie Mafia's leader on the streets, Mike Gillich, hired a hitman from Texas named Thomas Holcomb to commit the two murders. Thomas Leslie Holcomb was given the handgun with a homemade silencer which he used in the killings by Kirksey Nix's girlfriend Sheri LaRa Sharp, who in turn had received the gun from an enforcer for the Dixie Mafia named John Ransom who told her to give the gun to Holcomb for the hit on Mr. and Mrs. Sherry. Halat was later convicted in 1997 of conspiracy to commit racketeering, obstruction of justice, conspiracy to obstruct justice, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and was sentenced to serve 18 years in prison. =Release= Halat was released in 2013 after 15 years, 9 months and 7 days in jail at the age of 70 years old. He then worked at a church in Hattiesburg the remainder of the year. Halat still maintains he had no part in the murder plot. Co-conspirators Kirksey McCord Nix, Jr. (born 1943) is serving life imprisonment [in the Federal Correctional Institution at El Reno, Oklahoma].see public Bureau of Prisons records. Mike Gillich died of cancer in 2012. Thomas Leslie Holcomb, a Texas-based contract killer, was convicted of carrying out the killings and died in prison in 2005. John Ransom and Sheri LaRa Sharp, were both convicted in 1991 on federal conspiracy charges related to the two murders. Ransom was the Dixie Mafia hitman who supplied the gun used in the murders of Vincent and Margaret Sherry. Sharpe was Kirksey Nix's girlfriend who worked as a legal aid and helped him run his Lonely Hearts dating scam while he was in prison. The scam involved placing fraudulent ads in the national LGBT magazine The Advocate pretending to be young single homosexual men in legal trouble who needed money. Media portrayals A 1999 episode of The FBI Files details the FBI investigation of the Dixie Mafia, Pete Halat, and Kirksey Nix and his Lonely Hearts scam. It was also featured in Dominick Dunne's program Power, Privilege, and Justice on January 31, 2007. It is also featured in Season 1, episode 5 of Unusual Suspects.

First built as a chapel in 1733 and later expanded into its current structure in 1739, the church was abandoned by the Archdiocese of São Salvador in 1990. Located in the decadent Água de Meninos neighbourhood, the church was abandoned for a whole decade until it was reclaimed by a group of homeless people known as the Trinity community in 2000.  History  In 1733, the Brotherhood of the Rosary and the Holy Trinity took a piece of land from the parish of Santo Antônio Além do Carmo to build a chapel dedicated to both Our Lady of the Rosary and the Holy Trinity.Igreja da Ordem Terceira da Santíssima Trindade, Água de Meninos. Guia Geográfico - Patrimônios Históricos da Bahia. This temple was built on the hill which gives access to the Água de Meninos neighbourhood. In 1739, the Brotherhood opted to build a larger temple in the current location In his 1800 document describing the city, Luís dos Santos Vilhena notes that the temple was known as Church of the Rosary. In this document, the church is described as having no towers yet. In 1806, Pope Pius VII extinguished the Brotherhood of the Rosary and the Holy Trinity and created, in its place, the Third Order of the Holy Trinity – hence the church's name. In 1877, the government of Bahia donated the area of the Bom Jesus cemetery to the Order. In 1888, a fire consumed most of the church, leaving only its exterior walls intact. In 1968, the right tower collapsed after a storm. In 1990, the last mass was held in the church and it was completely abandoned for the next ten years.Pastoral de Comunicação. \\"Comunidade da Trindade celebrou os 15 anos de reabertura do templo\\". Arquidiocese de São Salvador da Bahia. 11 August 2015. In 2000, a Catholic monk named Henrique Peregrino organized a pilgrimage to Salvador and included the church in his travel itinerary. To his and his fellow pilgrims surprise, the church was closed. He then sought local Catholic authorities regarding the possibly of re-opening the church so that it could serve as a shelter for the poor. According to Peregrino, around a hundred people are assisted by him each year. Since 2007, he edits a bi-monthly newspaper called Aurora da Rua, which has a circulation of 10.000 and aims to generate income for the homeless people he shelters in the abandoned church.  Structure  The church is located on a flat terrain in the flank of the escarpment that divides Salvador in the Higher City and the Lower City.Galvão, Patrícia; Torres, Marieze Rosa.

Its location in Avenida Jequitáia is near the Água de Meninos fish market, and the church building is accessed by a stairway. It has three aisles and its façade contains Rococo and Neoclassical elements, although it was decharacterized by the 1888 fire, poorly planned and implemented restorations, and the crumbling of the right tower in 1968. According to the Institute of Artistic and Cultural Heritage of Bahia, the building was \\"damaged by the insertion of non- conforming elements such as concrete slabs in the galleries\\". It no longer has windows and its images – \\"of the Holy Trinity, Our Lady of the Remedy and many others of lesser importance\\" – were collected by members of the Order due to the state of deterioration of the building. The members of the Trinity community have promoted small restorations and included, in the altar, images and religious elements from the various religions present in Salvador. Around the church there are 20 houses, some of which are rented or made available for the members of the Trinity community.  The Trinity community  The Trinity community is a civil society group that provides assistance to the homeless population that live around the Historic Center of Salvador. Founded by the Catholic monk Henrique Peregrino, it refuses the label of non-governmental organization, considering that its philosophy and action differ from the NGO philosophy. There are 45 permanent residents in the church grounds, in addition to 50–60 homeless people which attend ecumenical cults and banquets held each Thursday. The food is prepared by the residents and the maintenance and cleaning of the spaces is made by everyone. Although it mostly caters to adults, the Trinity community maintains a project aimed specifically at young people. This project is run by a team formed by seven educators and two therapists, treating on average 50 to 60 children per day, performing a total of 1,200 consultations per month. The community aims to overcome the homelessness of its members by adopting a five-step program. The first step is that of food: it is about feeding, sharing the meal and participating in its preparation, putting and end in the begging for food. The second step concerns the reception of newcomers, regardless of their situation – they may be either guests or new members of the Community. The third step is caring: regularizing the documentation of the homeless and/or restoring their health. The fourth step involves gaining independence through income generation: the community members produce sacred art and grow flowers and fruits for sale; they collect cardboard to sell for recycling; and sell the Aurora da Rua newspaper, which they write themselves. There are also cases in which members of the Trinity community gain access to a formal job through covenants that Peregrino maintains with private companies. The fifth and final step is gaining access to housing, and it represents an end with the homelessness situation.

The house was home of Philip Arnold, a confidence man at the center of the Diamond hoax of 1872. It is a two-story house with a gable roof, built in a T-plan in 1869. Around 1912 a one-story frame porch was added, with Doric square posts, which was later partially enclosed. Around 1960 a one-story brick addition was also added.

She is best known for her landscapes, paintings and etchings of trees, her portrayals of the Cape mountains, and depictions of the Malay Quarter. She was the daughter of Christian Ludwig Karl Spilhaus (27 June 1847 Lübeck - 13 September 1878 Lisbon) and Virginia Augusta Coelho (18 September 1855 - 5 February 1878). Her siblings were Virginia Henriette Wiesner (1874) and Karl Antonio Spilhaus (1876). Nita's father moved from Lübeck in order to run a branch of the family business in Lisbon, and it was there that he met his Portuguese wife-to-be. After the loss of both her parents during her infancy, her mother dying in childbirth and her father some months later, Nita was raised by her grandfather in Lübeck, and her first training in drawing and etching took place at the Lübeck School of Art, then in Munich, where she attended a private art school run by , the Dachau art colony just outside Munich under Adolf Hölzel, and copper engraving under . She was part of a young artists' community in Schwabing and in 1900 published a folio of her etchings. She moved to South Africa in 1907 because of the death of her grandfather in 1906, joining her brother Karl, and the family of her uncle Arnold Wilhelm Spilhaus (1845-1946) at his home 'Hohenort' in Constantia, who had already settled in the Cape, was managing a successful import/export company, was an enthusiastic hiker and botanist, and was a founder member of the Mountain Club of South Africa. In due course she befriended various artists such as Edward Roworth, Moses Kottler, Allerley Glossop, Pieter Wenning, Ruth Prowse, Hugo Naudé and Florence Zerffi, who nursed her back to health during the 1918 flu pandemic. She joined the 'South African Society of Artists' soon after her arrival. The Cape Times acknowledged her talent as a graphic artist by publishing a modest booklet of 12 etchings portraying scenes in and around Cape Town. Working from a studio in Keerom Street in Cape Town she gradually became a leading member of Cape Town's art community. When Hugo Naudé visited Munich in 1913 she took over his art classes in Worcester. Even so, in a frenzy of wartime paranoia her brother was charged with being a German conspirator, and she, also a German national, was severely restricted in her movements during WWI, being only permitted to paint indoors, resulting in a large number of still lifes. She also applied for a position as curator of the Michaelis Collection, but her German provenance disqualified her. She married an osteologist Ernst Simon in 1921, the couple returning to Munich in 1925, living and working there until 1938,just before WWII, when they moved back to South Africa to stay. Ernst Simon died in 1943, and in the 1950s Nita and her widowed sister moved to Jonkershoek Valley. A progressive loss of eyesight forced her to cease painting. Her oil paintings were Impressionist in style, her landscapes rich in atmosphere, while her flower studies are notable for their vivid colours. She had a particular affinity with trees and her striking images of the Stone Pines around Cape Town are a recurring theme in her work. The name 'Spilhaus' is derived from the older German surname 'Spielhausen'.

It is an extension of temporal logic in which temporal operators are replaced by time- constrained versions like until, next, since and previous operators. It is linear-time logic that assumes both the interleaving and fictitious-clock abstractions. It is defined over a point-based weakly-monotonic integer-time semantics. For MTL, the exact complexity of the satisfiability problems is known and independent of interval-based or point-based, synchronous (i.e., strictly-monotonic) or asynchronous (i.e., weakly-monotonic) interpretation: EXPSPACE-complete.Alur R., Henzinger T.A.

Full MTL over infinite timed words is undecidable.Ouaknine J., Worrell J. (2006) On Metric Temporal Logic and Faulty Turing Machines. In: Aceto L., Ingólfsdóttir A. (eds) Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures. FoSSaCS 2006. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 3921. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg  Syntax  The full metric temporal logic is defined similarly to linear temporal logic, where a set of non-negative real number is added to temporal modal operators U and S. Formally, MTL is built up from: * a finite set of propositional variables AP, * the logical operators ¬ and ∨, and * the temporal modal operator UI (pronounced \\"\\\\phi until in I \\\\psi.\\"), with I an interval of non-negative number. * the temporal modal operator SI (pronounced \\"\\\\phi since in I \\\\psi.\\"), with I as above. When the subscript is omitted, it is implicitly equal to [0,\\\\infty). Note that the next operator N is not considered to be a part of MTL syntax. It will instead be defined from other operators. = Past and Future = The past fragment of metric temporal logic, denoted as past-MTL is defined as the restriction of the full metric temporal logic without the until operator. Similarly, the future fragment of metric temporal logic, denoted as future-MTL is defined as the restriction of the full metric temporal logic without the since operator. Depending on the authors, MTL is either defined as the future fragment of MTL, in which case full-MTL is called MTL+Past. Or MTL is defined as full-MTL. In order to avoid ambiguity, this article uses the names full-MTL, past-MTL and future-MTL. When the statements holds for the three logic, MTL will simply be used.  Model  Let T\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb R_+ intuitively represent a set of points in time. Let \\\\gamma: T\\\\to A a function which associates a letter to each moment t\\\\in T. A model of a MTL formula is such a function \\\\gamma. Usually, \\\\gamma is either a timed word or a signal. In those cases, T is either a discrete subset or an interval containing 0.  Semantics  Let T and \\\\gamma as above and let t\\\\in T some fixed time. We are now going to explain what it means that a MTL formula \\\\phi holds at time t, which is denoted \\\\gamma,t\\\\models\\\\phi. Let I\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb R_+ and \\\\phi,\\\\psi\\\\in MTL. We first consider the formula \\\\phi\\\\mathcal U_I\\\\psi. We say that \\\\gamma,t\\\\models\\\\phi\\\\mathcal U_I\\\\psi if and only if there exists some time t'\\\\in I+t such that: * \\\\gamma,t'\\\\models\\\\psi and * for each t\\\\in T with t< t< t' , \\\\gamma,t\\\\models\\\\phi . We now consider the formula \\\\phi\\\\mathcal S_I\\\\psi (pronounced \\"\\\\phi since in I \\\\psi.\\") We say that \\\\gamma,t\\\\models\\\\phi\\\\mathcal S_I\\\\psi if and only if there exists some time t'\\\\in I-t such that: * \\\\gamma,t'\\\\models\\\\psi and * for each t\\\\in T with t'< t< t , \\\\gamma,t\\\\models\\\\phi . The definitions of \\\\gamma,t\\\\models\\\\phi for the values of \\\\phi not considered above is similar as the definition in the LTL case.  Operators defined from basic MTL operators  Some formulas are so often used that a new operator is introduced for them. These operators are usually not considered to belong to the definition of MTL, but are syntactic sugar which denote more complex MTL formula. We first consider operators which also exists in LTL. In this section, we fix \\\\phi,\\\\psi MTL formulas and I\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb R_+. = Operators similar to the ones of LTL =  Release and Back to  We denote by \\\\phi\\\\mathcal R_I\\\\psi (pronounced \\"\\\\phi release in I, \\\\psi\\") the formula eg\\\\phi\\\\mathcal U_I eg\\\\psi. This formula holds at time t if either: * there is some time t'\\\\in t+I such that \\\\phi holds, and \\\\psi hold in the interval (t,t')\\\\cap (t+I). * at each time t'\\\\in t+I, \\\\phi holds. The name \\"release\\" come from the LTL case, where this formula simply means that \\\\phi should always hold, unless \\\\psi releases it. The past counterpart of release is denote by \\\\phi\\\\mathcal B_I\\\\phi (pronounced \\"\\\\phi back to in I, \\\\psi\\") and is equal to the formula eg\\\\phi\\\\mathcal S_I eg\\\\phi.  Finally and Eventually  We denote by \\\\Diamond_I\\\\phi or \\\\mathcal F_I\\\\phi (pronounced \\"Finally in I, \\\\phi\\", or \\"Eventually in I, \\\\phi\\") the formula \\\\top\\\\mathcal U_I\\\\phi. Intuitively, this formula holds at time t if there is some time t'\\\\in t+I such that \\\\phi holds. We denote by \\\\Box_I\\\\phi or \\\\mathcal G_I\\\\phi (pronounced \\"Globally in I, \\\\phi\\",) the formula eg\\\\Diamond_I eg\\\\phi. Intuitively, this formula holds at time t if for all time t'\\\\in t+I, \\\\phi holds. We denote by \\\\overleftarrow\\\\Box_I\\\\phi and \\\\overleftarrow\\\\Diamond_I\\\\phi the formula similar to \\\\Box_I\\\\phi and \\\\Diamond_I\\\\phi, where \\\\mathcal U is replaced by \\\\mathcal S. Both formula has intuitively the same meaning, but when we consider the past instead of the future.  Next and previous  This case is slightly different from the previous ones, because the intuitive meaning of the \\"Next\\" and \\"Previously\\" formulas differs depending on the kind of function \\\\gamma considered. We denote by \\\\bigcirc_I\\\\phi or \\\\mathcal N_I\\\\phi (pronounced \\"Next in I, \\\\phi\\") the formula \\\\bot\\\\mathcal U_I\\\\phi. Similarly, we denote by \\\\ominus_I\\\\phi (pronounced \\"Previously in I, \\\\phi) the formula \\\\bot\\\\mathcal S_I\\\\phi. The following discussion about the Next operator also holds for the Previously operator, by reversing the past and the future. When this formula is evaluated over a timed word \\\\gamma:T\\\\to A, this formula means that both: * at the next time in the domain of definition T, the formula \\\\phi will holds. * furthermore, the distance between this next time and the current time belong to the interval I. * In particular, this next time holds, thus the current time is not the end of the word. When this formula is evaluated over a signal \\\\gamma, the notion of next time does not makes sense. Instead, \\"next\\" means \\"immediately after\\". More precisely \\\\gamma,t\\\\models\\\\circ\\\\phi means: * I contains an interval of the form (0,\\\\epsilon) and * for each t'\\\\in(t,t+\\\\epsilon), \\\\gamma,t'\\\\models\\\\phi. = Other operators = We now consider operators which are not similar to any standard LTL operators.  Fall and Rise  We denote by \\\\uparrow\\\\phi (pronounced \\"rise \\\\phi\\"), a formula which holds when \\\\phi becomes true. More precisely, either \\\\phi did not hold in the immediate past, and holds at this time, or it does not hold and it holds in the immediate future. Formally \\\\uparrow\\\\phi is defined as (\\\\phi\\\\land( eg\\\\phi\\\\mathcal S\\\\top))\\\\lor( eg\\\\phi\\\\land(\\\\phi\\\\mathcal U\\\\top)). Over timed words, this formula always hold. Indeed \\\\phi\\\\mathcal U\\\\top and eg\\\\phi\\\\mathcal S\\\\top always hold. Thus the formula is equivalent to \\\\phi\\\\lor eg\\\\phi, hence is true. By symmetry, we denote by \\\\downarrow\\\\phi (pronounced \\"Fall \\\\phi), a formula which holds when \\\\phi becomes false. Thus, it is defined as ( eg\\\\phi\\\\land(\\\\phi\\\\mathcal S\\\\top))\\\\land(\\\\phi\\\\land( eg\\\\phi\\\\mathcal U\\\\top)).  History and Prophecy  We now introduce the prophecy operator, denoted by \\\\triangleright. We denote by \\\\triangleright_I\\\\phi the formula eg\\\\phi\\\\mathcal U_I\\\\phi. This formula asserts that there exists a first moment in the future such that \\\\phi holds, and the time to wait for this first moment belongs to I. We now consider this formula over timed words and over signals. We consider timed words first. Assume that I=\\\\mid a,b\\\\mid' where \\\\mid and \\\\mid' represents either open or closed bounds. Let \\\\gamma a timed word and t in its domain of definition. Over timed words, the formula \\\\gamma,t\\\\models\\\\triangleright_I\\\\phi holds if and only if \\\\gamma,t\\\\models\\\\Box_{]0,b[\\\\setminus I} eg\\\\phi\\\\land\\\\Diamond_I\\\\phi also holds. That is, this formula simply assert that, in the future, until the interval t+I is met, \\\\phi should not hold. Furthermore, \\\\phi should hold sometime in the interval t+I. Indeed, given any time t\\\\in t+I such that \\\\gamma,t\\\\models\\\\phi hold, there exists only a finite number of time t'\\\\in t+I with t' and \\\\gamma,t'\\\\models\\\\phi. Thus, there exists necessarily a smaller such t. Let us now consider signal. The equivalence mentioned above does not hold anymore over signal. This is due to the fact that, using the variables introduced above, there may exists an infinite number of correct values for t', due to the fact that the domain of definition of a signal is continuous. Thus, the formula \\\\triangleright_I\\\\phi also ensures that the first interval in which \\\\phi holds is closed on the left. By temporal symmetry, we define the history operator, denoted by \\\\triangleleft. We define \\\\triangleleft_I\\\\phi as eg\\\\phi\\\\mathcal S_I\\\\phi. This formula asserts that there exists a last moment in the past such that \\\\phi holded. And the time since this first moment belongs to I. = Non-strict operator = The semantic of operators until and since introduced do not consider the current time. That is, in order for \\\\phi_1\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal U}\\\\phi_2 to holds at some time t, neither \\\\phi_1 nor \\\\phi_2 has to hold at time t. This is not always wanted, for example in the sentence \\"there is no bug until the system is turned-off\\", it may actually be wanted that there are no bug at current time. Thus, we introduce another until operator, called non-strict until, denoted by \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal U}, which consider the current time. We denote by \\\\phi_1\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal U}_{I}\\\\phi_2 and \\\\phi_1\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal S}_{I}\\\\phi_2 either: * the formulas \\\\phi_2\\\\lor(\\\\phi_1\\\\land (\\\\phi_1\\\\mathcal U_{I}\\\\phi_2)) and \\\\phi_2\\\\lor(\\\\phi_1\\\\land (\\\\phi_1\\\\mathcal S_{I}\\\\phi_2)) if 0\\\\in I, and * the formulas \\\\phi_1\\\\land(\\\\phi_1\\\\mathcal U_{I}\\\\phi_2) and \\\\phi_1\\\\land(\\\\phi_1\\\\mathcal S_{I}\\\\phi_2) otherwise. For any of the operators \\\\mathcal O introduced above, we denote \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal O} the formula in which non-strict untils and sinces are used. For example \\\\overline\\\\Diamond p is an abbreviation for \\\\top\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal U}p. Strict operator can not be defined using non-strict operator. That is, there is no formula equivalent to \\\\bigcirc_I p which uses only non-strict operator. This formula is defined as \\\\bot\\\\mathcal U_I p. This formula can never hold at a time t if it is required that \\\\bot holds at time t.  Example  We now give examples of MTL formulas. Some more example can be found on article of fragments of MITL, such as metric interval temporal logic. * \\\\Box(p\\\\implies\\\\Diamond_{\\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\}}q) states that each letter p is followed exactly one time unit later by a letter q. * \\\\Box(p\\\\implies eg\\\\Diamond_{\\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\}}p) states that no two successive occurrences of p can occur at exactly one time unit from each other.  Comparison with LTL  A standard (untimed) infinite word w=a_0,a_1,\\\\dots, is a function from \\\\mathbb N to A. We can consider such a word using the set of time T=\\\\mathbb N, and the function \\\\gamma(i)=a_i. In this case, for \\\\phi an arbitrary LTL formula, w,i\\\\models\\\\phi if and only if \\\\gamma,i\\\\models\\\\phi, where \\\\phi is considered as a MTL formula with non-strict operator and [0,\\\\infty) subscript. In this sense, MTL is an extension of LTL. For this reason, a formula using only non-strict operator with [0,\\\\infty) subscript is called an LTL formula. This is because the  Algorithmic complexity  The satisfiability of ECL over signals is EXPSPACE-complete.  Fragments of MTL  We now consider some fragments of MTL. = MITL = An important subset of MTL is the Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL). This is defined similarly to MTL, with the restriction that the sets I, used in \\\\mathcal U and \\\\mathcal S, are intervals which are not singletons, and whose bounds are natural numbers or infinity. Some other subsets of MITL are defined in the article MITL. = Future Fragments = Future-MTL was already introduced above. Both over timed- words and over signals, it is less expressive than Full-MTL. = Event-Clock Temporal Logic = The fragment Event-Clock Temporal Logic of MTL, denoted EventClockTL or ECL, allows only the following operators: * the boolean operators, and, or, not * the untimed until and since operators. * The timed prophecy and history operators. Over signals, ECL is as expressive as MITL and as MITL0. The equivalence between the two last logics is explained in the article MITL0. We sketch the equivalence of those logics with ECL. If I is not a singleton and \\\\phi is a MITL formula, \\\\triangleright_I\\\\phi is defined as a MITL formula. If I=\\\\\\\\{i\\\\\\\\} is a singleton, then \\\\triangleright_I\\\\phi is equivalent to \\\\Box_{]0,i[} eg\\\\phi\\\\land\\\\Diamond_{]0,i]}\\\\phi which is a MITL- formula. Reciprocally, for \\\\psi an ECL-formula, and I an interval whose lower bound is 0, \\\\Box_I\\\\psi is equivalent to the ECL-formula eg\\\\triangleright_I eg\\\\psi. The satisfiability of ECL over signals is PSPACE-complete. = Positive normal form = A MTL-formula in positive normal form is defined almost as any MTL formula, with the two following change: * the operators Release and Back are introduced in the logical language and are not considered anymore to be notations for some other formulas. * negations can only be applied to letters. Any MTL formula is equivalent to formula in normal form. This can be shown by an easy induction on formulas. For example, the formula eg(\\\\phi\\\\mathcal U_{S}\\\\psi) is equivalent to the formula ( eg\\\\phi\\\\mathcal R_{S}( eg\\\\psi). Similarly, conjunctions and disjunctions can be considered using De Morgan's laws. Strictly speaking, the set of formulas in positive normal form is not a fragment of MTL.

It connects the Main-Weser Railway in Bad Vilbel with the Gießen–Gelnhausen railway in Glauburg-Stockheim. It was used as an access route to the line now referred to as the Oberwaldbahn (Oberwald Railway) between Glauburg-Stockheim and Lauterbach, which connected to the Vogelsberg Railway. The section between Heldenbergen-Windecken (now Nidderau) and Stockheim was opened on 1 October 1905 and the section between Vilbel Nord (now Bad Vilbel) and Heldenbergen- Windecken was opened on 1 June 1907. It was operated by the Prussian-Hessian Railway Company (Preußisch-Hessische Eisenbahngemeinschaft).  Route The single track section of the Nidder Valley Railway branches off from the Main- Weser Railway at Bad Vilbel station and turns to the east shortly after the northern exit from the station, crosses the Nidda and shortly later reaches the halt of Bad Vilbel-Gronau. This is also the location of the mouth of the Nidder river, which it follows upstream to the end of the line. After Niederdorfelden station, which is a passing place, the line runs through the Büdesheim Tunnel between the municipalities of Schöneck and Nidderau. The tunnel was originally shorter but it was extended to 200 metres during its renovation in 2004. The original capstone of the tunnel portal, which has its construction years (1904–1906) carved into it and was built near the original Büdesheim station, is the last remaining relic of the old tunnel. Immediately after the tunnel, the line passes through the Nidderwiesen nature reserve and the edge of the town of Nidderau is soon reached at Windecken. After a grade- separated crossing of the Friedberg–Hanau railway in Nidderau station, which was called Heldenbergen-Windecken for decades, the line follows the Friedberg–Hanau railway briefly, before turning towards Altenstadt. After a short section through a forest, it runs over a low embankment through an area that is subject to flooding by the Nidder to reach the forest again in Eichen. After a crossing of the Nidder before Höchst, the line soon reaches Altenstadt. Until about 1990, an industrial railway branched there to Waldsiedlung, which was three kilometres away. Less than an hour after leaving Bad Vilbel, after running through some meadows and crossing the Nidder again, the line finally reaches Glauburg and the station at the end of the line in the suburb of Stockheim where it meets the Gießen–Gelnhausen railway. Here it is the possible to continue towards Giessen or Gelnhausen. An important traffic flow until the beginning of the 1990s was the daily \\"beet train\\" that ran in November and carried sugar beet from the region to the sugar factory in Friedberg and after its closure in 1981 to Groß-Gerau. Since the end of rail operations, this traffic is carried by road transport. The line is 31 kilometres long between its terminal stations. The maximum line speed is 80 km/h. 35 tracks or roads cross the line and six level crossings are still not protected. One of these crossings was set to be abandoned, but the town of Bad Vilbel campaigned to keep it. This now has a 30 km/h speed limit.  Operations The Nidder Valley Railway was one of three railway lines integrated in the Frankfurter Verkehrsverbund (Frankfurt transport association, FVV) that was not operated as an S-Bahn line and was designated as an N-Bahn line. It is now operated by DB Regio Mitte as timetable route 634 on behalf of the FVV's successor, the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (Rhine-Main transport association, RMV), as its line 34. Almost all of the Regionalbahn services on weekdays and about two thirds on Saturdays run to Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof, while the rest begin and end in Bad Vilbel. There has also been a weekend service since 4 May 2008. As a result, RMV bus route 5150 (previously 650) between Bad Vilbel and Nidderau was discontinued on that day. In addition, with the commencement of the summer timetable of 2008, the maximum speed of trains was increased from 60 to 80 km/h and the interval between services was shortened on weekdays. The contract with Deutsche Bahn AG runs from 2008 for 20 years. According to a local newspaper from the Wetteraukreis, RMV's deputy chairman of the supervisory board reported that an additional 260,000 train-kilometres would be provided on the line during this period. In recent years, millions of Euros have been spent on modernising the line. As a result, all the trackwork has been renewed. Instead of concrete sleepers, steel Y-shaped sleepers have been installed. Furthermore, all halts and platforms in the stations of Nidderau and Stockheim have been rebuilt and the exit height for the double-deck cars has been raised to 76 centimetres. Initially only the platform of the Nidder Valley Railway was upgraded in Nidderau, while that of the Friedberg–Hanau railway was renewed in 2010. On 19 October 2007, the computer-based interlocking in Altenstadt was connected with two remote modules in Niederdorfelden and Nidderau; previously signalling and points in Niederdorfelden and Altenstadt was operated mechanically by cable. At the same time, new stations were relocated and new platforms were built at both stations, with temporary platforms initially being built to shorten the period of full closure. At the same time, there was a shift from left to right-hand operations at the intermediate stations. The modernisation work continued until the spring of 2008. The line speed was increased after the completion of all the work. Nevertheless, the tender for operations in 2010 initially received no bids from train operating companies. After concessions by the RMV, DB declared itself ready to tender for it. The explanation given by the RMV emphasised the cost of operating diesel locomotive-hauled double- deck sets in the peak periods; this led to plans to upgrade the line. Since 1985, when its decommissioning was considered, the line has seen an increase in passenger numbers of 330% from 1,800 to 6,000 per day; the upgrade is expected to continue to have a positive impact on passenger numbers. As of 2015, about 7,000 passengers used the line each day. = Rolling stock= The Nidder Valley Railway was operated at the end of the 1990s in the peak hour with locomotive-hauled trains of Silberling coaches (n-Wagen) and in the off- peak with class 628 diesel multiple units. From 2002, trains were composed of class 218 locomotives hauling double-deck, or sometimes Silberling, coaches. From the beginning of 2006, a class 628 set shuttled between Stockheim and Bad Vilbel in the off-peak hours as a replacement for trains consisting of a class 218 locomotive and Silberling coaches. In December 2012, the majority of services changed over to of Siemens Desiro Classic (class 642) diesel railcars, mostly in coupled sets and the remaining trains consisting of a class 218 locomotive and double-deck coaches. At the December 2014 timetable change, the class 218 diesel locomotives were replaced by class 245 (TRAXX) locomotives.  Prospects The RMV is planning to upgrade the line in response to demands from the neighbouring communities and districts. With electrification, the current costly and isolated operation with diesel railcars or diesel-hauled double-decker trains might be a thing of the past in time for the retendering of operations from 2028. In parallel selective upgrade measures (the installation of crossing tracks at stations, two-track sections) would make possible the intensification of services. A feasibility study is currently underway on the future of the Nidder Valley Railway, in which the options for its operation as an (electrified) regional railway, as a branch of S-Bahn line S6 or as an extension of U-Bahn line U5 are being compared.

Life and family A Unitarian, he was born into the renowned Martineau family of Norwich and christened in the Octagon Chapel. His eldest brother Philip Meadows Martineau became a distinguished surgeon and his youngest brother Thomas fathered sociologist Harriet Martineau and religious philosopher James Martineau. Engineer John Martineau was another of Peter's nephews. His first wife Susannah Scott had one son and his second marriage to Catherine Marsh brought him five more children, of whom Peter Martineau Jr was the oldest and Catherine Jr their first daughter – she married solicitor Edward Foss. Peter Jr wed Eliza Barnard and then Mary Anne, the sister of his schoolmate Sir Francis Ronalds. Peter Jr and Mary Anne's children included Sarah, whose husband was brewer and benefactor Charles Edward Flower. Peter and Catherine were buried at West Norwood Cemetery. Business interests Peter Finch Martineau was active in various distinct businesses through his life. He was first a textile dyer in Norwich with his older brother David. He, David and their younger brother John then established a brewery at the King's Arms Stairs (one of the watermen's stairs on the Thames), which merged with Whitbread in 1812. Next followed a sugar-refining partnership in Goulston Street, Whitechapel with his son Peter Jr, which continued until around the latter’s death in 1869; Peter Jr patented an important new process for clarifying sugar in 1815 with his cousin John Martineau. Peter Finch also opened a bank in St Albans after he moved there in 1818. The family in addition invested in mining operations in Devon, Cornwall and overseas, managed by Peter Jr's second cousin John Taylor. These included the Wheal Friendship mine at Mary Tavy and United Mines near Redruth. They also held Directorships in various Assurance companies: Peter Finch in the Hand in Hand Fire Insurance Society, and Peter Jr in the Equitable Assurance Office – he also served as auditor of the Phoenix Fire Assurance Company. Education initiatives The Martineaus supported a wide range of targeted education initiatives. Peter Finch was an early Governor of the African Institution, founded by abolitionists when they succeeded in making the British slave trade illegal. He helped establish the School for the Indigent Blind in 1800 and was still chairing its meetings nearly half a century later – the organisation continues today as SeeAbility. He was also a Governor of the London Asylum for the Support and Education of the Deaf and Dumb Children of the Poor; the House of Refuge for Orphan Girls; and the Refuge for the Destitute, which assisted people discharged from prison to enter the workforce. Finally, he served as Vice-President of the Manchester Academy Nonconformist higher education institution in York for nearly two decades. Political activities Like others in his family, Martineau was Whig cum Radical in his politics. A friend of the political philosopher William Godwin, he joined the London Revolution Society and was an energetic supporter of Norwich MP William Smith. He later served as Deputy Lieutenant of Hertfordshire. Peter Jr played an active role in the Anti-Corn Law League from its beginnings in the late 1830s, where he chaired large meetings in the boroughs where he lived and worked to garner support for the removal of import duties.

There are over 70 described species of Pseudacteon fly. They are also known as ant-decapitating flies due to their parasitic larval stage. An egg is injected by the female fly into the shoulder joint of an ant worker. Soon after, the egg undergoes rapid inflation as it appears to absorb ant hemolymph. This first instar larva migrates into the ant head and consumes the jaw muscle and other tissues, leaving the mandibles hanging and preparing a future exit space. After about two weeks, the ant worker is termed a \\"zombie\\" because the fly larva has effectively taken control. The worker leaves the nest and dies in the leaf litter or in a crack in the soil. As it dies, the ant's head falls off, apparently because the fly larva releases an enzyme that dissolves the membrane attaching the ant's head to its body. The fly pupates in the detached head capsule, requiring a further two weeks before emerging through the ant's mouth. In tropical, subtropical areas the flies are active all year round, but in temperate regions they are active during all months except the winter months. Several Pseudacteon species were deliberately introduced to the United States to combat via biological control the invasive fire ant species Solenopsis invicta.

He started his musical career in the early 1960s and gained remarkable national and international success as soloist as well as member of different bands. His longtime cooperation and partnership with famous German Rock singer Peter Maffay kept raising his popularity which he would campaign for social and humanitarian activities. He retired from music business in 1989. Tame is married and living in Hamburg, Germany.  Musical career  Tame started his musical career in the early 1960s yet under his common name, Uwe Reuß. He performed as bassist, guitarist and singer in different German bands such as The Rascals (not to be mixed up with US-American Pop-Band The Rascals), The Gigolos and The Delegates. In 1964 he decided to make a living as a professional and gained attention in numerous Galas und TV-Shows, also in foreign German-speaking countries. Since 1967 he carried on using a pseudonym, Johnny Tame, and reached his biggest international success with his song \\"Sand in my Shoes\\".Billboard Magazine – November 25th 1967Official Swiss Hit parade Tame played numerous festivals and was German representative at the Maltese Song-Festival \\"OSCAR\\" in 1968 where he finished third. The same year he contributed as singer on two songs of a Perry Rhodan movie using the pseudonym Sherman Space.Eckhard Schwettmann: Fast alles über Perry Rhodan: Das Buch für Fans.

Tame formed the Johnny Tame's Time Machine in 1972 and was bassist and singer of the band Bourbon Family. Moreover he played with the Orpheus Band of Schlagersinger Costa Cordalis until 1976. Though media- and stage-appearance got more and more, the crucial breakthrough wouldn't succeed. = Tame and Maffay = Tame had a very successful collaboration starting in 1976 with famous German Rock Singer Peter Maffay.Edmund Hartsch: Maffay – Auf dem Weg zu mir. C. Bertelsmann Verlag, 2009. As duo Tame & Maffay they produced two Country Rock albums. Moreover Tame more or less went to be a constant guest at Maffay's studio- and live- productions until 1985 what finally earned Tame the long awaited economic success. His overall album-sales gained multiple Gold-, Platinum- and Diamond- Certifications. After all his deep disinterest in financial matters led to a subsequent monetary disaster. Lasting problems during live- and studio-work due to Alcohol and Hashish consume have been spread as the main reasons for breaking up the cooperation in 1984. Only years later the public – and even Tame himself – came to know, that he was suffering from Chronic fatigue syndrome. His last production took place in 1986. He quit playing music and sealed himself off from any kind of public appearance. In 1989 he left his residence on East Frisian Island Borkum only for receiving the award \\"Artist of the year in Niedersachsen\\", a small city event in Northeim and a five-day- open-air festival in Bremen – The Breminale.  Social commitment  Tame already used his popularity in an early stage of his career in order to support social and humanitarian projects as well as ecology groups. He broached the issues of air pollution, forest dieback or the use of nuclear energy – sometimes radically – long before those problems where picked out as a central theme in Germany and elsewhere. He played concerts with Joan Baez for Amnesty International and Humanitas in the early 1980s, also at the Concert for Afghanistan in Hamburg. He constantly supported Greenpeace and the German groups and initiatives Künstler für den Frieden, AGA Aktionsgemeinschaft Artenschutz and Nicaragua-Foundation of Dietmar Schönherr.

Located west of Sydney CBD, the reservoir is elevated and was built on reinforced concrete piers, which is one of the oldest of this type that is still in use. The reservoir features various decorative attributes, plastered by hand, which lack in other functional reservoirs. Established in 1920, the reservoir serves a large area of South-Western Sydney.Bankstown Reservoir (Elevated) (WS0007) Conservation Management Plan, Sydney Water, 2005 History In 1826, the reservoir was once a hanging site for bushrangers. Patrick Sullivan and James Moran, both members of Sullivan's gang, were hanged at the site on 18 October 1826 after creating a stir in the Bathurst district. The site on which the Reservoir sits may be connected with the earliest period of Bankstown's European settlement, transport routes, the bushrangers which traversed Liverpool Road and the appearance and carrying out of law and order in the district. =Construction= Construction of Bankstown Reservoir began in October 1918. The reservoir was built to meliorate the pressure on Ashfield Reservoir and obviate pumping from Ryde. In November 1918, the cornerstone for the piers were unveiled in stiff clay to an unfaltering shale foundation, to an average depth of . The concrete for the reservoir was made on site, with the sandstone acquired from a quarry at Potts Hill. Power was administered by a portable steam engine. The rendering was made by ornamental exterior plastering and waterproofing of the interior of tank by cement gun. Hand rendering began in February 1920. Extra adjustments to the reservoir include the aluminium roof built in 1962 to preserve water quality. It is likely that the concrete walkway was removed or covered by the roof. At the time of its construction, Bankstown reservoir was the largest elevated reinforced concrete elevated reservoir in the country. After its completion, elevated reservoirs built in reinforced concrete became common until the 1950s, with one similar tower established in the 1930s in Padstow Heights.Amplification of Waterloo Pumping Station in Sydney Water Board Journal, 1963 =Proposed developments= In 2015, it was proposed by Bankstown City Council and Sydney Water for the tower to be ornamented with decorative lights from sunset to sunrise, akin to those displayed in Vivid Sydney. Bankstown councillor Naji Najjar's vision was to turn the tower into a tourist attraction that could rival Coffs Harbour's Big Banana and Goulburn's Big Merino, stating \\"I believe it is important that Bankstown City Council, together with Sydney Water, take the opportunity to promote this icon of our city\\".Council, Sydney Water meet over tower project, September 1st, 2015 As part of Cr Najjar's plan, the area would also be embellished with fencing, landscaping and Australian native gardens, with interpretative signage, including a stone monument revealing the site's history. He concludes, \\"The lighting could have themes for various charity and community events and awareness campaigns\\". The council would eventually write to the State Government and await approval. Design Bankstown Reservoir. Bankstown reservoir is built of reinforced concrete and contains a circular water tank. Being akin to a rotunda, it is backed up by 36 strengthened concrete pillars and decorative arches which encircle the establishment. The inward columns are assembled of reinforced concrete while the outer ones consist of plain concrete. Construction aggregate was used for the concrete in the elevated tank and its columns and sandstone conglomeration for the bowed encirclement and ground foundations at the bottom. Instead of a handrail at the top, the reservoir has a concrete rectangular paneled parapet wall.Bankstown reservoir (WS0007): Conservation management plan, Sydney Water Corporation, 2005 The tower's arches have a moulding and a circular pattern above each column, with the base of the tank having moulded apron with rectangular panels above. Furthermore, the structure was restrengthened to abide to the earthquake code in 2009. The design of Bankstown Reservoir exemplifies the Victorian and neoclassical architectural of the early 20th century. Its structure is mostly intact and has sustained minor alterations thus retaining its integrity. The reservoir has been roofed to safeguard water quality in the 1960s-1970s. =Features= Bankstown Reservoir supplies drinking water to households as far west as Villawood and Condell Park in the southwest, Croydon in the east, and Auburn and North Strathfield in the north. It has a capacity of with its waters having a depth of . The reservoir has a foot bridge to a walkway on the top of the water tower, passing through the centre of the tank. The tower's rooftop, being above sea level, provides panoramic views of the Sydney skyline and Greater Western Sydney area. The reservoir is surrounded by brush box, coral tree, poplar and fig trees.Bankstown entry, in 'The Book of Sydney Suburbs', Pollen, Francis & Healy, Gerald, 1988 The reservoir is renowned for being the first concrete reservoir to be elevated on concrete piers. Sydney Water Heritage Program leader Phil Bennett stated the Bankstown reservoir has \\"the highest level of heritage protection because it is the oldest of the class of elevated reinforced concrete reservoirs\\". Mr Bennett concluded, “It’s quite decorative so it has aesthetic value and it sits very prominently on a hill top and it can be seen for miles, so it has landmark values”. The reservoir supplies drinking water to households in areas such as Villawood, Condell Park, Croydon, Auburn and North Strathfield. Access Heritage boundaries The reservoir is situated on the corner of Hume Highway and Stacey Street in the northeastern periphery of Bankstown, bordering Greenacre. However though, the main entry to the water tower is from Beresford Avenue, which is a dead end street accessed from Hume Hwy.Bankstownreservoir : archival digital photographic record, Sydney Water Corporation, 2009 Heritage register The reservoir was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register as a site of State significance on 18 November 1999 with the following citation: > Bankstown Elevated Reservoir has a considerable level of state heritage > significance as a representative example of a common reservoir design > strongly favoured by Board engineers during the early period of the > twentieth century.

They were absorbed by Italian State Railways (FS) in 1905 and became FS Class 910. History With the conventions of 1885, Rete Sicula took over the lines of Società per le Strade Ferrate Calabro-Sicule and had to face the problems of constructing new lines and introducing modern locomotives. The engineer Guglielmo Cappa designed the Class 400 steam locomotives which were re-registered as FS Class 910 on nationalization in 1905. The locomotive was designed to tackle steeply- graded lines, such as Messina - Palermo with its pass of the Peloritani Mountains and its long tunnel. It also had to be suitable for minor local or commuter services and to have the characteristic of bidirectionality, to gain time at terminal stations by avoiding the need for turntables. The choice was a 2-6-2T which allowed the same speed in both directions of travel. The locomotives were built by Ansaldo of Sampierdarena and deliveries took place during the passage of the Sicula Network to the FS. In 1906 a specimen was exhibited at the Milan Exposition. The first delivery was of 6 locomotives registered by the Sicula network as RS 401-406. Later deliveries were numbered in the FS 91xx series from the start. The entire group became concentrated in Milan for suburban services and those in Sicily were transferred to Milan. Over the years, they underwent small changes and continued to perform good service in the locomotive depots of Milano Centrale and Pavia for the service on the lines from Milan to Bergamo, Como, Lecco and Voghera. =Diesel conversion= In 1929 the 910.042 was experimentally converted to a Diesel- Zarlatti locomotive. This had a diesel engine and compressed-air transmission, using the original steam cylinders. It was not a great success and had no practical follow-up.http://www.trenidicarta.it/pdf/13/13637.pdf =World War II= During World War II, some locomotives were used for operations in Yugoslavia and seven of them remained there permanently at the end of the war, incorporated by the Yugoslavian Railways (JZ). Technical features The locomotives used saturated steam and compound expansion. The high-pressure cylinder was on the left, with piston valves, and the low-pressure cylinder was on the right, with a slide valve. Outside Walschaerts valve gear was used. The locomotive frame was carried on three coupled axles and two one-axle trucks, of the Adams type, at the two ends. This made the locomotive stable, even at high speeds, both in forward and reverse. The boiler had 222 fire tubes, increased to 226 in the second ordering series. Despite being a tank engine, the locomotive carried 3,000 kg of coal and 8,000 kg of water. A modification carried out from the second series onwards was the increase in the diameter of the carrying wheels from 830 to 960 mm and the replacement of the Nathan lubrication system with a Friedmann lubrication pump. The locomotive was equipped with a compressed air brake and a proportional brake. It was also equipped for steam heating of the train.

Biography  Gert Prix was born in Klagenfurt, where he spent his childhood. His father Helmut was a businessman and inventor, his mother Felicitas was employee. In 1984 Prix married his wife Gerti, who gave birth to two children, Thomas and Denise.  Musical career  Prix started his musical career at the age of 7 at the Carinthian State Conservatorium. When he was 15, he was a founding member of a boy group called “Sir Donald”, who went on to become the band “Three Tight”. In 1980 “Three Tight” won Peter Rapp’s ORF TV show “Die Große Chance” (The Great Chance). For more than 26 years the band kept their original format and performed at the lake Woerthersee with Gert Prix (keys), Heinz Köchl (guitar) and Rolf Holub (drums). Not least because of their entertaining stage show they were known as “the cult band of lake Woerthersee”, who created the legendary Woerthersee sound. They also performed in several Woerthersee-films of the German-Austrian Lisa Film company. In the year 2000 Heinz Köchl went his own separate way and the other two members formed the still existing “Beach Band”, a Beach Boys tribute band.  Eboardmuseum  Since 1973 Gert Prix has been interested in technics and history of electronic musical instruments. In 1987 the Eboardmuseum, which is now considered to be the largest museum for electronic keyboard instruments worldwide, arose out of his rapidly growing collection of vintage instruments.

Plot Male model John Price encounters Tina Bryant while walking her poodle, \\"Cool Rump\\", in a park. Although she initially resists his advances, they flirt after John accidentally trips over the dog, and agree to a date that evening. While picking her up, John is cautioned by Tina's strict, widowed mother Sonia that her daughter is a Catholic and a virgin, and is not to be taken advantage of. After dancing at a discoteque, Tina becomes uncomfortable with John's insistent leering, and the pair agree to return home. Early next morning, Tina returns to her mother's apartment with her expensive mini-dress torn beyond repair. When Sonia questions her, Tina declares that John tried to rape her. =Tina's story= On their way home, John invited Tina back to his apartment as he was expecting a business call. She opted to wait outside, but after being teased by two gay neighbours, George and Esmeralda, she decided to go into the apartment, a stereotypical swinger's pad. John left the room to change into a sweater, but returned in his underwear and attempted to mount Tina; during the altercation, he tore through the dress and she scratched his forehead in self-defence. After barricading herself in the bedroom, she escaped. =John's story= John returns to the discoteque and drinks with three of his friends. Their curiosities are piqued by his forehead injury, prompting him to share his side of the story. In his recollection, both Sonia and Tina were unrelentingly coquettish towards him, and the latter was more than willing to return to his apartment. The pair had sex multiple times throughout the night, and Tina's libidinousness eventually tired John; she unwittingly scratched him while stroking his hair. Tina's chance for another tryst was lost when they were visited by George and Esmeralda, forcing them to end their date with light conversation. =The Doorman's story= As John returns home, his sex-crazed, voyeuristic doorman converses with a milkman, claiming to have watched the encounter through binoculars. John had brought Tina home to provide Esmerelda with company while he and George had sex in his bedroom. To dissuade Tina's disbelief about John's homosexuality, Esmeralda told her of how they met at the Club Karma Sutra, which turned out to be a story of how she convinced a German woman to pose for nude photographs. When Tina reacted in shock to John and George's lovemaking, Esmeralda drugged her drink, rendering her unconscious, and raped her. When Tina awoke and tried to escape, her dress was torn as she tried to retrieve it from John, who she scratched as he held her down for Esmeralda to take advantage of again. =The Scientist's story= After presenting a lecture on perception, a scientist proposes a fourth version of the story. Here, John and Tina's initial encounter and date were friendly and without conflict. John suggested that they share a drink at his apartment, offering to keep his door open as a sign of trust. There, both admitted their mutual attraction, but decided that they would share intimacy once they knew each other better. As John and Tina left, they discovered that the front gate was jammed; their attempts to call for the doorman were fruitless due to him being distracted by his pornography collection. John tried to lift Tina over the gate so she could unlock it from the outside, but her dress got torn on the gate, and she scratched his forehead after she nearly fell to the ground; when Tina worried about how Sonia would respond to the torn dress, John jokingly suggested that she tell her that he tried to rape her. They then waited until another occupant was able to let them out. Upon George and Esmerelda's arrival, the doorman arrived to fix the gate, and John and Tina drove away. The scientist is dissatisfied with this apparently \\"true\\" account, and questions the logic of the \\"open door\\" policy, as well as the couple's response to the jammed gate. Suggesting that the truth is hidden amid the embellishments and falsehoods provided by these four accounts, he reveals that the only fact he is certain of is that rather than immediately returning to Sonia's, the couple drove to the seaside to watch the sunrise together.

Life A native of Braunschweig, he served as a city scribe for octroi (tariffs) in that city from 1488. In that year, in the context of a popular rebellion in Braunschweig, he composed a number of satirical poems against city councillor Ludeke Hollant. After a period of exile, he appears as the keeper of the city wine cellar during 1493-1496, and in 1497 was re-introduced to his former function of city scribe. Renewed political unrest in 1513 resulted in his losing his office once again and being arrested. He was condemned to death, but the sentence was converted to house arrest at the last minute . In 1516 he is recorded as manager of the city brickyard. Literary production Bote is the author of Boek van veleme rade (1491), a description of the feudal order of the day. His chronicle, known as the Braunschweiger Weltchronik, covers the period from 1444 to 1516. Reynke de vos, a Low German adaptation of the older \\"Reynard\\" material printed in Lübeck in 1498, is sometimes attributed to Bote. In 1503, he published a Zollbuch, dealing with tariffs. In 1514, he published Schichtbuch (Schicht being the local term for revolt or civil unrest), including both earlier revolts and the revolt of 1487-1489 he had himself been involved in. Attached to the chronicle is a brief description of the churches, monasteries and chapels in Braunschweig and a Wappenbuch. In 1517, Bote published a collections of aphorisms under the title De Köker. In 1518, he published a revised chronicle, known as the Hannoversche Weltchronik. His latest known publication is a satirical poem on the Hildesheim Diocesan Feud, written in 1519. Bote has also been suggested as the author of the first printed chapbook on Till Eulenspiegel, printed in 1510 under the title of Ein kurtzweilig Lesen von Dil Ulenspiegel geboren uß dem Land zu Brunßwick. This publication, extremely successful in the course of the 16th century, was signed by its author only with \\"N.\\" Authorship of Bote was suggested due to the acrostic ERMAN B being formed by the initials of chapters 90 to 95. in support of Bote being the author: Siegfried H. Sichtermann, Die Wandlungen des Till Eulenspiegel (1982). Against the identification: Jürgen Schulz-Grobert, Das Straßburger Eulenspiegelbuch, Niemeyer, Tübingen (1999). Schulz-Grobert argues that the acrostic, if not entirely spurious, more likely refers to Hermannus Buschius. References * Herbert Blume, Eberhard Rohse (eds.): Hermann Bote.

Mechanical keyboard instruments Keyboard instruments can be found as far back as the hydraulis (a water organ) in the 3rd century BCE, which developed into the pipe organ, and small portable instruments such as the portative and positive organ. Additional keyboard instruments, the clavichord (tangent- struck strings) and harpsichord (quill-plucked strings), were developed in the 14th century CE. As technology improved, more sophisticated keyboards were developed, including the 12-tone keyboard still in use today. Initially, the keyboard of an instrument such as a pipe organ or harpsichord could only produce sounds of one particular volume. In the 18th century, the pianoforte was invented. The pianoforte had metal strings which were struck by hammers which were activated by pressing or striking the keys. Depending on whether the keys were pressed lightly or forcefully, the pianoforte would produce a softer or louder sound. Early electrified keyboards The next step towards creating electric keyboards was to apply electric sound technology. The first electric musical instrument of any type was the Denis d'or stringed instrument, which was built by Václav Prokop Diviš in 1748. It had 700 strings temporarily electrified to enhance their sonic qualities. In 1760, Jean Baptiste Thillaie de Laborde developed the clavecin électrique. This was a keyboard instrument played with plectra and activated by electricity, but neither instrument used electricity to produce sound. In 1874, Elisha Gray invented an electric musical instrument called the musical telegraph. It made sound from an electromagnetic circuit's vibration. He later incorporated a basic single note oscillator and a loudspeaker consisting of diaphragm to make these notes audible. Electric keyboards and synthesizers In 1906, Lee de Forest invented the triode electronic valve. In 1915 he invented the first vacuum tube instrument, the audio piano. Until the invention of the transistor, the vacuum tube was an essential component in electric instruments. In 1935, the Hammond organ was introduced, exploiting previous limited production efforts like the Robb Wave Organ from 1923. It was capable of producing polyphonic sounds by virtue of a spinning shaft with many magnetic 'lobes' which would cycle past an electromagnetic pickup at a rate that would produce each desired tone. The Hammond organ was connected to a power amplifier and a speaker cabinet. In 1929, the electric piano was invented. In 1939, Hammond introduced the Novachord which used about 170 vacuum tubes, coils, capacitors and resistors largely to create an upper octave of notes and then divide them in half using 'flip flop' circuits to create successively lower octaves from each note. The instrument also has many features like envelopes for filter and amplifiers so that sounds can be contoured at the user's discretion, making it the first production analog synthesizer. In 1941, Georges Jenny's previously prototyped Ondioline became the first truly portable synthesizer keyboard (the Novachord weighed over ). More developments were made with the Chamberlin Music Maker in late 1940s and the Mellotron in the early 1950s, which employed mechanisms to play back recordings at speeds that would produce the desired tone for the key being struck. Other technologies improved on this idea over the years. Machines like the Optigan used photo-emulsion to create disks that had images whose density would convert to waveforms when spun in front of a beam/sensor assembly. In 1981 the E-mu Emulator was marketed to digitally store samples and play them back. The first step towards the electric piano was by Harold Rhodes who developed various prototypes using parts from B-17 aircraft that were being scrapped. He received a medal since the resulting keyboard was used as therapy for people rehabilitating from injuries from WW2. (It is small enough to set on a stand over a patient's bed in a hospital, looking something like a miniature grand piano in shape.) Instructions were made and people built this \\"pre-piano\\" which amplifies the signals generated in a pickup from the vibration of stainless steel rods tapered near the steel base they are driven into holes in. Piano type wooden hammers are used to strike them. It was a three octave (E to F for 38 notes) instrument. A tube amplifier drove a speaker pointing out the bottom. In 1955, the Wurlitzer Company released the company's first electric piano, the model 100. The wurlitzer strikes flat tines whose vibration is amplified from a surrounding electrostatic charged 'comb'. In '59 the Fender company bought the Rhodes name and produced the piano bass and then in the mid-'60s began producing the famous Fender Rhodes series which used rod shaped tines mounted on a steel piece that runs parallel above them, with a coil pickup on each individual tine. The invention of the transistor in 1959 spawned the production of progressively more compact keyboards. Many home organs maintained the appearance but lost some weight due to the lower power consumption needs of transistor circuitry. Also in this era 'combo organs' found a lot of use like the famous Vox Continental used by the Beatles and others, the Gibson G101 used by The Doors, and other organs by Farfisa, Wurlitzer, Acetone (Roland) and others. These were usually built using 12 oscillators and transistor pair 'divider' circuits to produce all the frequencies like all non- 'tone wheel' electronic organs of the era. They were just more compact and thus suited for 'combo' use. Synthesizers The exploration of musical synthesizers in the 1960s was a step towards the modern keyboard. As technology became more developed, huge synthesizers evolved into portable instruments that could be used in live shows. The rapid accumulation of momentum began in 1964 when Bob Moog produced his Moog synthesizer. It used a remote keyboard and was 'modular' in design. (i.e. it was a rack that held boxes which each had a function. At least one was to create a tone controlled in pitch by a voltage input, and usually a host of other modules including filters, amplifiers, envelope generators, etc.) His next generation was equipped with a built-in keyboard in 1970: the Mini-Moog. These keyboards were monophonic, along with semi-modulars like the ARP2600, and were only able to respond to one note at a time. (Though three oscillators could be layered together in response to the 'control voltage' produced by that note.) In 1972, instruments such as the EML 101, ARP Odyssey, and Moog Sonic six were duo- phonic meaning they could produce two different tones at once when two different keys were pressed. And in 1974 Oberheim produced the first polyphonic synthesizer using their SEM Modules (which were originally designed to allow musicians to just layer more complex sounds together in a monophonic 'stack'.) They produced a key assigner circuit that would assign a note to one of several SEM modules. (They came in 2, 4 and 8 voice racks eventually.) When more notes were hit than the number of racks available, the latest note would have to 'steal' one of the SEM modules from the note it had been assigned to. These polyphonic synthesizers were very popular eventually and Yamaha produced the CS-50 in 1976 which had four voices that didn't have to be individually programmed in order for them to sound the same. A sea of other entries followed. In 1970, Ken Freeman demonstrated the first 'string machine' which was essentially combo-organ like in size and how it generated tones. It had simple controls though centered around creating an ensemble effect where vibrato is happening at slightly different rates on different notes like in a real orchestra. Freeman used six discrete LFOs (low frequency oscillator circuits) to modulate atypically hit together note combinations (diminished fifth combinations like C and F). It had two 'ranks' of 12 oscillators plus a single oscillator driving a chip that develops the top octave of notes in the version that hit market in 1974. In November 1974 the British patent 1,509,530 lists an electronic digital musical arranger by Nicholas Kenneth Kirk. This patent was sold to Waddington's House of Games as Compute-a-Tune. This product was marketed in the early 1980s and sold a few thousand or so in the £15 range. The ARP Solina String Ensemble and Crumar Stringman used a much less expensive approach using digitally clocked chips called BBDs. Only a few hundred were made. In 1973, the Yamaha GX-1 was manufactured. It was an early polyphonic synthesizer, featuring eight voices.Yamaha GX-1, Vintage Synth Explorer In 1974, Roland Corporation released the EP-30, the first touch- sensitive keyboard.FutureMusic, issues 131-134, 2003, page 55 Roland also released early polyphonic string synthesizers, the RS-101 in 1975 and the RS-202 in 1976.A TALE OF TWO STRING SYNTHS, Sound on Sound, July 2002 In 1975, the turn towards building a synthesizer of sorts over an organ came to fruition in Moog's Polymoog. Many patents exist from this keyboard. Each note had its own circuit board with a VCF/VCA chip so that it was truly fully polyphonic. Many were disappointed that the filter lacked the facilities of the more flexible moog filter used in other keyboards and the abundance of unreliable connectors. In 1975 Crumar of Italy produced the \\"Multiman\\" which also was an organ with synthesizer facilities. It had a bass option, a brass with filter controls and simple envelope, a piano and clavi preset, and a couple string tabs with decay control and vibrato control. In 1976 the ARP Omni combined a more limited synthesizer with a string machine and bass also and became ARP's biggest seller. In the same year, the Korg PE-1000 used an individual saw oscillator for each note. In 1977, the Yamaha CS-60 and CS-80 polyphonic synthesizers began to implement synthesizer 'memory'. However, it was merely an alternate set of sliders that hid under a hatch. In 1978, the OB-1 from Oberheim gave actual electronic storage of the sound settings. The Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 the same year offered this feature in a five voice polyphonic synthesizer. Dave Smith's company developed some other firsts, but the ARP engineers were acquired by Fender when they bought the mismanaged company in 1979. They completed the Fender Rhodes Chroma, the first computer controlled keyboard. Released in 1981, an Apple computer could be used to run sequencing software that allowed the user to easily program which notes were being hit at particular instants in the song production. The 'Chroma' port only appeared on the successor though, the Chroma Polaris in 1984. MIDI keyboards Dave Smith's company found interest in a cooperative effort with Roland. In 1983, the invention of MIDI as a standard for digital code transmission digital technology development spurred on more great development in keyboard technology, as now keyboards from different manufacturers could communicate through an inexpensive cable, jack and system of codes. The Sequential Circuits Prophet 600 and the Roland Jupiter 6 communicated via MIDI at the NAMM trade show and Yamaha soon had the standard implemented into their DX synthesizers which would outsell all previous keyboards. The Yamaha DX7 used entirely digital circuitry leaving it free from the need of calibration, and vast numbers of parameters that could be accessed. The \\"FM\\" (frequency modulation) synthesis method was something that had not been explored to near this depth. Most synthesizers before this were subtractive synthesis, i.e. starting with a very harmonic-laden sound and selectively subtracting from this sound using low, high or bandpass filters, or some other methods that tended to result in stranger sounds, like ring modulation. Also in 1983, Dave Smith's company marketed the first polyphonic synthesizer keyboard that could play more than one sound at a time called the 'Six-Trak'. It had a six track sequencer and each track could access a different sound. The same year the SCI Prophet T8 with optical key sensing became the first piano action emulating MIDI keyboard. After ARP's demise, the remaining companies that had produced analog synthesizers rapidly began to feel the stress of the newly popular digital synths. Roland and Korg, also from Japan, developed some innovations of their own and each had 'hit' keyboards: the D-50 from Roland and M1 from Korg in the late 1980s. The total unit sales for the Yamaha DX series reached over 1 million with the others from Roland and Korg over 250,000. The success of the D-50 and M1 was riding on the back of the Kurzweil K250, which first applied this technology well in 1984. This machine was the first fully digital workstation with facilities to sample acoustic sounds with a microphone and play them back with a rate that is proportioned for the note being struck. Many great samples were included in the unit, including a piano sound that is still used in the 2000s. As well, the samples can be routed through a synthesizer architecture of some kind. Initially, some companies steered away from emulating the subtractive synthesis in the digital realm because it was difficult to model how a filter would respond to these complex signals. By the early 1990s, some new implementations were beginning to appear. The Peavey DPM series also touted as the first keyboards that could import samples which were not 'sampling keyboards'. They also were the first to use off the shelf DSP chips, which emulated the response of analog filters. This sample playback technology also spawned a vast number of inexpensive consumer units called home keyboards in electronics stores and toy stores. As the price of memory began to plummet, almost every company was making keyboards of this type. Casio and Yamaha have led sales in these types of units, which feature built in speaker systems, usually can run from batteries or power adapters, and have a library of samples with very limited editing, if any. They often use cheap plastic strips of keys to keep costs down. On a different note, the Kurzweil K150 and the Kawai K5 explored additive synthesis where harmonics can be proportioned to make different tones while enveloping groups of them differently in the mid-'80s. RMI had explored this to a limited extent in 1974 with the harmonic synthesizer they produced. This less common synthesis method is also used in Kawai's last synthesizer product series, the K5000s from 1996. Organs like the Hammond B-3 use drawbars to control harmonic content of the tone, but the K5000 has an envelope for each harmonic in the entire audio spectrum and dynamic filter control over that for vast possibilities in sound creation.

It is also the final major coastline wetland at Lake Ohrid and one of only seven marshes with relict communities that still exist in North Macedonia.Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning of the Republic of Macedonia (2014) Fifth National Report to the Convention on Biological Diversity, Skopje, North Macedonia. With several millennia of natural history, it is a site of key conservation interest.Spirovska, M., et al. (2012) Integrated Study on the State of the Remains of Studenchishte Marsh and Measures for its Revitalization. Dekons-Ema. Drustvo za ekoloshki consulting. Studenchishte Marsh  Flora and Fauna  Furnishing habitat for a wide variety of species, Studenchishte Marsh harbors flora and fauna that differ substantially to those of Lake Ohrid, which is one of the most biodiverse inland waters on Earth. Consequently, the marsh contributes significantly to the biological, ecosystemic and habitat diversity of the Ohrid region, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in part due to the Outstanding Universal Value of its nature. Historically, Studenchishte Marsh was one of Lake Ohrid's most important nesting sites for birds and spawning locations for cyprinid fish, although much of this significance has been lost in recent years due to a range of anthropogenic pressures. Nonetheless, while far fewer birds nest at Studenchishte than in previous times, its avifauna still boasts upwards of 50 species, and Studenchishte Canal, which marks the northern border of the wetland area, remains inhabited by 17 kinds of fish, including several that are endemic to the Ohrid region. Among the minimum nine varieties of amphibian to be found in the area, the Macedonian Crested Newt (Triturus macedonicus) and Yellow-Bellied Toad (Bombina variegata) are noteworthy. Reptile and mammal fauna is insubstantially researched, although the European pond turtle and three species of snake are confirmed in the former category, and otter, fox, beech marten and European polecat in the latter. Studenchishte is likely home to several rodent and bat species, yet precise data is lacking. Among invertebrates, Studenchishte Marsh and its surrounding coastal waters display 16% of the Gastropoda, 20% of the Tricladida, 35% of the Oligochaeta and 22.5% of the Chironomidae found at Lake Ohrid, while the 9 planarian taxa of the wetland include several that are endemic to Lake Ohrid's coastal springs. Beetles, one of the few insects to have been studied in detail, appear in 39 different varieties, some of which have not been recorded anywhere else in North Macedonia, and biological diversity is further boosted by 34 kinds of dragon and damselflies, 19% of which are specific to Southern Europe. In terms of plants, Studenchishte supports a wide variety of habitats including alkaline marshes and fens, and semi-natural wet meadows. The alkaline fens have higher nutrient levels, which encourages greater plant and animal diversity. The result is a flora that displays 50% of the total diversity of plant associations recorded for marshes in North Macedonia. In addition, ten rare and relict species have been recorded in the location, indicating that it has refugial qualities for wetland flora. Half of these are now believed to have been extirpated from the location, but others such as Carex elata may offer a source from which to rehabilitate other degraded wetlands in North Macedonia.  Ecosystem Services  Studenchishte Marsh instigates benefits to the local region beyond habitat provision for biodiversity. Its 5-meter deep peatlands, which have accumulated over 5,000 years, provide carbon storage and its function as a natural filter prevents nutrients from entering Lake Ohrid and thereby buffers against eutrophication. This is significant due to the research opportunities presented by Lake Ohrid's unique ecosystem, which depends on its highly specific water conditions. In previous years, as a location for spawning fish, Studenchishte Marsh was additionally a contributor to Lake Ohrid fisheries, although this function has been severely depleted.  Threats  Much of Studenchishte Marsh's previous surface area has been converted into farmland, roads or buildings. It has been further degraded by large-scale construction of tourism facilities. Several of the channels that once connected it with Lake Ohrid have been disrupted. The urbanization of beaches has caused the depletion of reed belts. Additionally, high volumes of construction waste have been deposited in the wetland, covering six hectares. As a result, its ability to shelter and raise fish populations has been almost totally lost alongside much of its importance for birds. Modification of the General Urban Plan for the City of Ohrid 2014-2024 envisaged draining the area almost completely and replacing it with tourism accommodation, recreation facilities, a marina and a sports center. These intentions sparked international attention and the 2015 establishment of a citizen initiative, Ohrid SOS, which was created in opposition to the plans. Global scientific organizations such as the Society of Wetland Scientists (SWS)Letter from Society of Wetland Scientists to Mayor of Ohrid City (7 October 2015) Available 20/4/2018 at http://sws.org/images/News/LakeOhrid2015.pdf and International Society of Limnology (SIL) also spoke out on the issue. In 2017, proposals to drain and develop Studenchishte were reversed although local government plans for a marina continue to lack clarification.  Protected Status  Designation for Studenchishte Marsh as a protected natural area has been suggested for decades, although it has never been completed at a national level.

History In the 1920s, there was a search for alternatives to the steam locomotive for railway traction, to reduce cost and improve efficiency. The main alternatives were railway electrification or the use of an internal combustion engine, such as the diesel engine. A disadvantage of the internal combustion engine was the need for a transmission system. One option to be explored was the conversion of an existing steam locomotive by fitting a diesel engine and an air compressor to supply compressed air to the existing steam cylinders. This was the constructive principle on which the Zarlatti locomotive was based. It may be seen as a development of the earlier Mekarski system.http://www.tramroma.com/common/gen_tecn/sist_trasp/traz_zarl.htm Between 1928 and 1929, FS steam locomotive number 910.042 was modified at the Royal Arsenal of La Spezia to test the system, which was based on the patents of the inventors Fausto Zarlatti and Umberto Simoni. If the system had been a success, it could have led to the modification of a large number of FS steam locomotives and the avoidance of the need to build new locomotives. The tests took place on the Rome–Lido railway from 6 April to 25 April 1929 with 16 round-trip pairs. The maximum speed reached with a tail load of 101 tonnes was 74 km/h.http://www.trenidicarta.it/pdf/13/13637.pdf The experiment had some success but there were problems. On 17 April, the piston of the engine water circulation pump broke and on 23 April a Westinghouse compressor tube was removed. The experiment, for these reasons, had no practical follow-up. Technical features The boiler and superstructure were removed from the locomotive in the arsenal workshop at La Spezia but the original compound expansion steam cylinders were left in place. A six-cylinder, two-stroke, diesel engine built by Fiat-San Giorgio was installed. This engine produced 325 hp at 450 rpm and drove a rotary compressor, built by a Swiss company in Winterthur, which delivered compressed air at 8 bar pressure. A small naphtha- fired boiler with a heating surface of 52 square metres was also installed for the production of steam. Cooling water from the engine and compressor was fed into the boiler at about 70°C. For cold starting, the boiler was used to preheat the diesel engine. When the locomotive started from rest, the original steam cylinders were fed with steam alone, but when running they were powered by a mixture of steam and compressed air. The steam was needed to prevent the cylinders icing up, because compressed air cools when it expands.

She was one of the best two-year-old fillies of her generation in England when she won three of her four races, namely the July Stakes, Richmond Stakes and Gimcrack Stakes. In the following spring she won the 1000 Guineas and finished second in both the Epsom Oaks and the Falmouth Stakes. She was retired at the end of the year but died before she could make and mark as a broodmare. Background Four Course was a bay mare bred in England by J P Arkwright. As a foal the filly was put up for auction at Newmarket and was bought for 910 guineas by the trainer Fred Darling. A year later she returned to the sales ring and fetched 3,000 guineas with the winning bid coming from Lord Ellesmere. She was trained throughout her racing career by Darling at Beckhampton in Wiltshire. Four Course's sire Tetratema, was the leading British two-year-old of 1919 and went on to win the 2000 Guineas and many important sprint races. As a breeding stallion, Tetratema sired many good sprinters and milers including Tiffin, Mr Jinks and Myrobella and was the British champion sire in 1929. Four Course's dam, Dinner became an influential broodmare whose descendants included Ridge Wood, Old Vic, High Top and Acatenango. Racing career =1930: two-year-old season= As a two-year- old in 1930, Four Course was ridden in most of her races by Freddie Fox. In her first engagement at Royal Ascot in June she started favourite but finished second to the colt Goyescas in the Chesham Stakes. For the rest of the season the filly continued to be matched against male opposition, eschewing in the main fillies' races. At Newmarket Racecourse in the following month she won the July Stakes at odds of 15/8, from a field which included Portlaw (later to win the Middle Park Stakes). A month later at Goodwood Racecourse she started 8/13 favourite for the Richmond Stakes and won from the colt Disarmament. Another win followed at York Racecourse on 28 August when she prevailed by a short head and a neck from Lampeto and Pisa in the Gimcrack Stakes. By the end of the season, Four Course had earned £5,220 in first-place prize money. In the Free Handicap, a ranking of the year's best juveniles, she was rated the second best filly of 1930 behind the Aga Khan's Turtle Soup. =1931: three- year-old season= On 1 May 1931, Four Course started at odds of 11/1 in a twenty-runner field for the 118th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket. She was ridden by Charlie Elliott, who won a coin toss with Fox for the right to have first choice of mount. She won by a head from Lady Marjorie (who appeared to be a somewhat unlucky loser after swerving in the final furlong) with Lindos Ojos a length away in third. Her victory earned her owner £8,854. Four Course was stepped up in distance for the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse on 5 June and started at odds of 6/1. Ridden by Fox, she ran well and looked likely to win after taking the lead in the straight but was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten a length into second by the French-trained filly Brulette. The filly was dropped back in distance for the Falmouth Stakes at Newmarket in July and finished second to Pisa, to whom she was conceding fourteen pounds in weight. She was beaten in two subsequent races and retired from racing at the end of the year. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Four Course a \\"poor\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas. Breeding record Four Course was retired from racing to become a broodmare but died of tetanus at Cloghran Stud in Ireland before she produced any foals.

No members of this gens attained any of the higher offices of the Roman state, but several are known from inscriptions. Origin The nomen Sibidienus belongs to a class of names ending in -enus, typically derived from other gentilicia, or sometimes from cognomina. Sibidienus would seem to be derived from Sabidius, or perhaps from its derivative, Sabidianus. Gentilicia of this type were common in Umbria and Picenum, and in fact most of the Sibidieni known from inscriptions seem to have lived at or near Tuficum in Umbria, from which it appears that the Sibidieni may have been of Umbrian origin, although the surname Sabinus borne by some of the family suggest that they may have been Sabines.Chase, p. 118. Praenomina The main praenomina of the Sibidieni were Lucius and Gaius, the two most common names throughout all periods of Roman history. It also appears that the Sibidieni at one time used Spurius, a praenomen that had been common in Republican times, but which had become increasingly scarce, and finally disappeared under the early Empire. Branches and cognomina The only distinct family of the Sibidieni lived at Tuficum in Umbria, but they do not appear to have been divided into separate branches. Sabinus, the only surname known to have been passed down among the Sibidieni, belongs to a class of cognomina typically indicating the place of origin of an individual or family, and suggests that the Sabidieni either were, or claimed descent from the Sabines. Maximus, borne by one or two of the family, was typically given to an eldest son, or bestowed on someone who had earned great honor or distinction. Scaeva, borne by an ancestor of the Sabini, originally designated someone who was left-handed, but could also refer to someone particularly lucky, or unlucky.Chase, pp. 109, 111, 114.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. vv. scaeva, scaevus.

Martin also occasionally worked in oil and china painting. Born on January 3, 1865 in Toronto Ontario, Martin began her training with her father, Thomas Mower Martin. Martin later studied at the Toronto Art School under Marmaduke Matthews and George Reid. Martin began exhibiting in 1883, and would continue to show her work for the next sixty years. A member of the Ontario Society of Artists, Martin also had a long teaching career, particularly in the field of watercolor.  Early Life  Emma May Martin was born on January 3, 1865 in Toronto, Ontario. Her father, Thomas Mower Martin, was a well-known landscape painter, and her mother, Emma Nichols Martin raised nine children, of which Martin was the eldest. The five daughters and four sons of the Martin family were all involved in the arts as children, through exposure to music, painting and writing in their home. Martin and siblings had private tutors as children, and therefore did not partake in any public schooling.  Training  Thomas Mower Martin is credited with introducing his daughter to painting and facilitating her early training. It is noted that he taught her the rudiments of paintings in 1876 and was her teacher until she attended the Toronto Art School, where she studied under Marmaduke Matthews and George Reid.  Artistic Career  Martin began exhibiting watercolors in 1883. By 1886 Martin was successfully entering in all of the major Canadian art shows. She exhibited with the Art Association of Montreal from 1885-1915, the Toronto Industrial Exhibition (later known as the Canadian National Exhibition) from 1890-1897, and the Royal Canadian Academy from 1887-1913. Martin was voted into membership with the Ontario Society of Artists in 1889 and exhibited with the group from 1885-1925. Martin's work Late Twilight was exhibited at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. Due to exhibition records hundreds of Martin's works have been named, however scant first-hand documentation is available. Martin worked primarily in watercolor, choosing to depict mostly landscape and still life scenes. There are notes of her completion of one or two oil paintings, however these are not traceable. A few china painting examples have been found. Nearly all of Martin's works are signed, making attribution easier. She did not commonly date her works, therefore making it difficult to track her progression. Martin would paint various images of the same area and title them similarly, making it difficult to track the exact number of her works- an example being four separate yet very similar paintings were made of the Ontonabee River. Martin would also hold works back from exhibition for years after they were complete, which has created more difficulties when trying to establish a chronological timeline of her existing works.  Technique  Martin's technique noticeably changed as her career progressed. In her earlier years she favored still life scenes and floral depictions. Her scenes were filled with bright colors and defined details. Further into her career she started to prefer landscape scenes, with her later paintings containing a unique, blurred softness. This technique may have been achieved with the use of a sponge. Martin preferred to work on off- white paper laid down on a board, and would typically outline her images in graphite before applying paint. Martin stressed the importance of viewing nature first hand when painting it, insisting on travelling to the locations she wished to paint. She would spend large amounts of time studying specific natural elements to recreate them in her paintings. Martin commonly painted flowers and trees from her personal garden, allowing her unrestrained access to her subject matter. An image painted by Emma May Martin in 1920- Mcdonald's Creek near Sparrow Lake  Critical Reception  Early critiques of Martin's work in contemporary newspapers judge the artists work mainly in accordance to her father and his successes. In the early portion of her career her works are not typically mentioned by name in reviews, the consensus being that her father can be proud of her work, and her ability to carry on the family legacy. As Martin's career progressed, she started to be viewed as a separate artist, with her works acknowledged by name in newspaper articles and exhibition reviews. Martin's work was viewed positively for the most part. Her works were lauded for their use of color and general treatment. Her drawing skills and use of light were also viewed as strengths. Martin also received some negative critiques. It is noted that some reviewers believed she had difficulties with composition, therefore creating crowded scenes.  Teaching Career  Alongside painting, Martin had a long teaching career. She taught painting at the Presbyterian Ladies' College in Toronto from 1889-1910. There is potential she taught classes at the Rosedale League Art School as well. Martin did teach private lessons in her own studio, as well as outdoor sketching classes, for the majority of her career.  Personal Life  Martin never married. She lived in Toronto for much of her life, first helping raise her siblings, and later her nieces and nephews. After her mother's death in 1911 she also assumed care for her aging father. These familial commitments left her little time to paint. Martin was comfortably wealthy throughout her life due to her family's position, and therefore never had to work or rely on the sales of her artwork for livelihood. This meant that Martin only painted when the urge struck, and she had the time. Martin treated her art solely as a hobby, even during her later periods of success. Martin loved to travel and was a member of the Rosedale Travel Club. She commonly travelled through Ontario and Quebec to paint, as well as occasionally branching out to other parts of Canada. She was particularly fond of painting the Muskoka District, as well as Quebec's Eastern Township. She took two documented trips to Europe, one to England and Scotland with Thomas Mower Martin in 1906, and one on her own to England in 1925. The former trip produced many works, which where exhibited between the years of 1912 and 1928. Martin's main passion besides painting was gardening, and she was a member of Toronto's Horticultural Association. Martin was also a member of the New Jerusalem Church and the Canadian Authors Association. Some sonnets and poems of the artists do exist today.  Later Life and Death  Martin continued to exhibit works until 1943, when she was in her mid-seventies. After she retired from painting she spent much of her time gardening and researching her family genealogy. Martin's health began to fail in the 1950s, at which time she moved to Montreal, Quebec to live with one of her younger sisters. Martin died in Montreal on February 10, 1957 at the age of 92.  Legacy  Today, Martin's remaining traceable works mainly reside in private collections. One work, Summer Landscape with Geese, is in the public collection at the Art Gallery of Windsor. It is unclear which of Martin's oeuvre remain due to their location. One posthumous solo exhibition, Water Colours by E. May Martin, was presented at the Robert McLaughlin Gallery in Oshawa, 1980. This continues today to be the only known show solely consisting of Martin's works.

Best known for her figures carved in wood, Kahane began her career as a printmaker and commercial artist.  Early life  Kahane was born in Vienna, Austria March 1, 1924. In 1925, she and her family moved to Canada, and settled in Montreal. In Montreal, Kahane attended high school at Strathcona Academy where no art course was taught. The absence of these studies influenced her to seek extra-curricular activities related to art. Upon enrolling in night classes at the École des Beaux-Arts in Montreal (1940), she furthered her studies in traditional sculpture, commercial art, industrial design, and architecture. In the fall of 1942 Kahane began training as a commercial artist at Valentine's School of Commercial Art.https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/6091/1/MM80995.pdf She was part of a 2-year intensive program while also working at a commercial engraver's studio. Kahane lived with her mother, using the home of her friends as studio space, and obtained planks of wood for her art from the local lumberyard. In 1945 she went to New York to study at the Cooper Union Art School. It was there that she discovered the art of woodcarving, the technique that would later shape her career.

Alexander's painting consists primarily of landscapes, still-life scenes, and studies of nature both aquatic and land based. She has exhibited at the Royal Canadian Academy, the Women's International Exhibition (Detroit), and the Art Association of Montreal between 1929 and 1935. Prior to this, she served as president of the Women's Art Association of Canada, in her hometown of Hamilton. Despite Alexander's brief tenure as president, she remained involved with the association for many decades. In 1953, Alexander was involved in the decision to create a new art gallery in Hamilton. Alexander also took to supporting young artists by allowing them to hang their work alongside hers in exhibitions held in her home. Her painting style has been described as colourful and vibrant, especially with respect to her depictions of flowers for which she is most well-known. An influential figure in the Southern Ontario art world in the early-to-mid 1900s, archives of her life and work can be found through the Women's Art Association of Hamilton, as well as through the Canadian Women's Artist History Initiative.  Early life and education  Wilhelmina Alexander was born in Hamilton, Ontario, on July 2, 1871. She lived at 176 Hughson Street South in Hamilton. Alexander studied at the Hamilton Art School under John Ireland, John Gordon, and \\"Miss Howell\\". She later studied privately under G. Horne Russell in Montreal, Quebec.  Artistic career  Alexander's painting style has been described as being akin to the Impressionist movement, and the Canadian Group of Seven Artists (particularly that of Tom Thomson). Her work is known for its vibrant use of colors. While she is most well-known for her floral scenes, she has also painted landscapes, still-life scenes, and landscape scenes depicting water. Most of her landscape paintings depict places in Southern Ontario such as the Georgian Bay and the Muskoka Lakes regions. However, she has also painted scenes from England, South Carolina, and Bermuda. Her floral scenes have garnered her the most attention out of all of her paintings. On three separate occasions, she exhibited her floral scenes in Toronto and Montreal through the Royal Canadian Academy. Her participation in the annual exhibitions held at the Art Gallery of Hamilton was predominantly made up of these floral scenes. Among those exhibited include her Bowl of Zinnias, July Garden, Phyllis and Bittersweet, Canterbury Bells, and Pom-Pom Zinnias.  Affiliation and recognition  Throughout her life, Alexander was involved in a number of associations. As an attendee to its inaugural meeting in 1894, Alexander was involved with the Women's Art Association in Hamilton for more than five decades. In 1914, she was involved with a citizen committee to organize a new art gallery in Hamilton (formerly known as the Women's Committee of the Art Gallery of Hamilton). She served as president of the Women's Art Association from 1925 to 1928. During its brief lifetime, Alexander presided over the Hamilton Art Association as a trustee from 1935 to 1942, after which the association dissolved. In 1953, Alexander was heavily involved in the creation of a new site for the Hamilton Art Gallery on Forsythe and Main Street West. As a tribute for her continued support, Alexander was allotted the right to 'turn the first sod' on the new grounds. In 1951, Alexander received the Woman Citizen of the Year Award. Alexander has exhibited with a number of distinguished institutions, including the Royal Canadian Academy in Toronto; Ontario and Montreal, Quebec; the Art Gallery of Hamilton, Ontario; and the Women's International Exhibition in Detroit by invitation.  Philanthropy  In 1911, Alexander organized a 'tag day', in which she collected money from passers-by and gave them a tag to represent where their donations were given. All of the proceeds went to the Young Women's Christian Association. For much of her career, Alexander was involved in developing the careers of other local artists. Throughout the 1930s, she used her home on Hughson Street South as an exhibition space for young artists. Among the invitees for these events were more than 200 citizens of Hamilton. In the 1940s, she utilized her home as an exhibition space to raise money for the war effort. She continued to use her house afterwards as a gallery to raise money for the Art Gallery of Hamilton.  Death and legacy  Wilhelmina Alexander died in St. Peter's Infirmary in Hamilton, Ontario, on November 7, 1961, in which she reached 90 years of age. In many pieces of literature, Alexander is documented under a few different names including: Mina Alexander, Wilhelmina Towers Alexander, and Mrs. S. H. Alexander. Alexander is still recognized by the city of Hamilton as a contributor to the art scene in the early-to-mid 20th century. Her art can be seen today in the Hamilton Art Gallery. Prior to her death the Women's Art Association in Hamilton recognized her as an honourary president and life member.

Then she bundles together her watercolours and sets off by bus from her Cote des Neiges apartment to the foot of McGill Street where she explores along St. Paul to St. Gabriel, or Bonsecours, in search of something worth preserving.\\" At the age of 57, Kinsman had earned her diploma in piano from the Royal Toronto Conservatory of Music. In 1967, Kinsman published her Montreal Sketchbook to mark the Canadian Centennial. = England = In 1972, after her husband's death, Kinsman left Canada to live in England and be closer to her family. There, she lived in the Cotswolds village of Broadway. She also lived in the village of Pershore. There, Kinsman created works \\"High Street Broadway\\" and \\"Pershore Abbey,\\" now in the Archives Department of the Eastern Townships Resource Centre in Sherbrooke, Quebec. Also in the collection is her \\"The Bells of Paradise,\\" an essay describing her time in Pershore. In England, Kinsman's work was displayed at multiple solo exhibitions in both Pershore and Malvern as well as in a group exhibition at the Royal Watercolour Society and Royal Academy of Graphic Artists in London. Kinsman's time in Broadway influenced her publication of \\"Broadway Sketchbook,\\" a compilation of scenes from her time there, including depictions of village people whom she \\"mocked a little.\\" Her works created in Broadway, specifically one of her old stone house, show what Franck Les Tyrs called Kinsman's \\"magical ability to capture light and mood.\\" = Lennoxville, Quebec = The last seventeen years of Kinsman's life were dedicated to studying and creating artworks, essays, and other publications in Lennoxville, Quebec. In the 1980s at the age of 71, Kinsman returned to Quebec, Canada from England. Settling in Lennoxville, Kinsman continued to study fine arts and additionally languages, music history and British history as a special undergraduate student. After a full career of creating art, Kinsman enrolled in a BA Fine Arts program at Bishop's University in Sherbrooke, Quebec. It is quoted that Kinsman was \\"sidetracked\\" into other subjects such as languages, history, and music. In the end, Kinsman graduated with a BA in liberal arts, accepting the degree in 1983. The summer after her graduation, Kinsman travelled to Santiago de Compostela, following the famous pilgrimage route across Spain. Kinsman's experiences from that trip were later recounted in a lecture \\"The Way to Compostela\\" later that same year at Bishop's University, as well as in French at the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Sherbrooke. In 1983, Kinsman reapplied to Bishop's University as a special undergraduate, now for the second time, taking history, classics, and language courses. Kinsman also began a masters of English from McGill University. Kinsman's thesis was centred around medieval studies, particularly about the canon Sumer is icumen in, \\"as she wished to prove, by John of Fornsett.\\" Kinsman was awarded the MA from McGill University in 1987 at the age of 78. Afterwards, Kinsman continued studies at Bishop's University, leading to a second BA in classics, achieved in 1989. At the same ceremony, Kinsman was awarded an honorary doctorate by Bishop's University (DCL Honoris Causa). Kinsman's final class was taken in 1996 at the age of 86. Through these years of Kinsman's studies, \\"her artistic career continued with great vigour,\\" as she travelled to Europe during the summers, bringing back new works.  Artistic Output  Kinsman spent her lifetime working with watercolour, pen, and ink. The subject matter of many of her works, especially later in her life, were scenes of streets, buildings, nature, and people caught in moments of daily life. Kinsman's works provided a quick glimpse but included detail such as words on a sign or a pigeon in a street. Kinsman's style differs from that of her first teacher, Amédée Ozenfant, whose style was primarily cubist. Kinsman's work is more comparable to those of her other mentors, Dr. Arthur Lismer and Anne Savage, both known for depicting scenes of nature. Kinsman published three sketchbooks in her lifetime: Montreal Sketchbook (1967), Broadway Sketchbook (1974), and Lennox Sketchbook (1990). As part of her master's degree from McGill University, Kinsman published a work entitled Sing cuccu nu. Kinsman's work was displayed in numerous solo and group exhibitions in Quebec and in various locations in England. A full list of exhibitions are detailed below.  Personal life and death  Kinsman was married to Ronald Desmond Lewis Kinsman in 1932. The two met in Paris while Kinsman studied fine art. From there, the couple moved to Switzerland for her husband's business, then to New York City, and finally to Montreal. She \\"loved her children.\\" She had three children: Michael Jon (who died in 1986), Jocelyn, and Jeremy. After her husband's death in 1965, Kinsman travelled back to England where she spent time creating art depicting scenes of daily life and quiet streets. Once back in Canada, Kinsman spent the rest of her life fulfilling her love of learning in Sherbrooke, Quebec at Bishop's University. At the age of 89, Kinsman died of Pneumonia in Lennoxville, Quebec.  Legacy  Kinsman's works are currently located in various private collections around the world including the Rothchild Collection (Montreal), the R. Martindale Collection (Marbella, Spain), the Stratford-upon-Avon Gallery in England, and the Musée des beaux- arts de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Quebec. After her death, drawings and materials used by Kinsman were donated to the Archives Department of the Eastern Townships Resource Centre, Sherbrooke, Quebec, including copies of each published sketchbook.

Tunnillie was born in Nunavut and traveled for much of her life. Tunnillie's work in drawing and printmaking focused on animals and life in the North. She was one of the oldest printmakers to work with the West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative.  Early life  Tunnillie's exact birth date is unknown, which is typical of that time in Nunavut. She was born somewhere near Frobisher Bay, Nunavut in 1911.  Family life and traveling  As a teen, Tunnillie was taken in by an older man named Iyola Tunili. Tunili already had a wife named Samalinga, but also wished to marry Ikayukta. The family lived in harmony together. The family included Tunili, his first wife Samalinga, their child, and Ikayukta. They spent many years on the move, traveling from Resolute Bay, to Clyde River, Pangnirtung, Netiling Lake and finally to Cape Dorset. They lived in skin tents which they made and traveled by dogsled. As a young woman, Tunnillie traveled on the Nascopie ship from the south Baffin area to the Arctic Bay and the north Baffin coast. Tunnillie's first child was born aboard the Nascopie. After Iyola died from a respiratory infection, Tunnillie continued to travel with her second husband, Nungusweetuk. Tunnillie only settled in Cape Dorset in 1970, at the age of 59.  Career  Tunnillie began printmaking with the West Baffin Eskimo Co- operative, which was a craft center and co-op store that formed in 1959. The co-op was instrumental in bringing stonecut image art to the area. The practice was brought to the co-op by James Houston, who spent four months in Japan studying the art form. The Hudson's Bay company and the Canadian Guild of Crafts provided supplies for the co-op. Tunnillie's daughter Kakulu, who became a successful artist herself, began drawing before Ikayukta. Kakulu encouraged her mother to start drawing while Tunnillie was living in Aqiatalaulavik with her son. Her work was first exhibited in the 1971 Cape Dorset Annual Collection, and she was one of only 14 artists featured in the collection. Tunnillie also found financial empowerment through her artwork. In an interview with the Cape Dorset Collection, she recalled carrying her art to the co-op to sell it. Tunnillie remarked, \\"I get pleasure out of drawing when I feel like it. And also when there is not enough money to buy food I know that I can help [my family] by selling some drawings. When I notice that there is something missing or that my family doesn't have enough food for the weekend or the week, that's when I draw – and also, when I feel like drawing, that's when I draw\\". Selling drawings to the co-op was Tunnillie's only source of income. Tunnillie was very humble about her work, stating in the Dorset Annual Collection of 1980, \\"Even though I can't really draw well, it's fortunate that they put my prints in a book like this – even through I can't draw like the others do. Tunnillie's work was featured in exhibits at: * Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and the National Museum of Man, Ottawa, Ontario * Winnipeg Art Gallery, Winnipeg, Manitoba * Inuit Gallery of Vancouver, Vancouver, British Columbia * Rideau Hall presented by Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, Ottawa, Ontario * Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and Canadian Arctic Producers, Ottawa, Ontario * Los Angeles, California, U.S.A. * Scarsdale, New York, U.S.A. * Hartsdale, New York, U.S.A. * Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, U.S.A. * McMichael Canadian Collection, Kleinberg, Ontario * Muscarelle Museum of Art College of William and Mary Williamsburg, Virginia, U.S.A. Solo Collections: * Ikayukta Retrospect: Stonecuts, lithographs and drawings from 1972 to 1980, Inuit Gallery of Vancouver, Vancouver, British Columbia Featured artist: 1978 Cape Dorset Annual Collection  Later life  Tunnillie became a mother to two children, Qavaroak in 1928 and Kakulu in 1940. She also became a grandmother and was widowed sometime before 1975. In 1980, the Cape Dorset Collection reported that she was house ridden because of painful joints. At that time she was living with her grandson and his family. Her last contribution to an exhibit was as part of the 21st annual Cape Dorset collection in 1980. She died that year in Cape Dorset as one of the oldest printmakers in the community.

L’Heureux's work was prominent during the Victorian Era. At that time, art moved towards romanticism and mysticism in connection with social values and the arts. Photographers during the Victorian Era came primarily from Europe, or trained there. This resulted in a European influence on Canadian photography. L’Heureux's initial artistic focus was on portraits, typically of children, for which she became known. She expanded to include calling cards and landscapes. L’Heureux contributed to documentary photography in the 19th century through her photos of residents and landscapes of Quebec. She managed her own photography company after the death of her husband.  Early life  L’Heureux married Jules Isaie Benoit dit Livernois in 1849 and established their daguerreotype studio in 1854 in the home of L'Heureux's parents. This business later expanded to include three studios specializing in portraits. L’Heureux took over the business after Livernois died of tuberculosis in 1865. A year later she partnered with her son-in-law Louis Bienvenu, creating The Livernois and Bienvenu photography studio. L’Heureux gave birth to son Jules Ernest Benoit dit Livernois on August 19, 1851, in Saint-Zéphirin-de-Courval, Quebec. He followed his parent's footsteps, traveling throughout Quebec taking landscapes photos and outdoor group portraits. In 1989, he was one of four 19th-century photographers to be commemorated with a Canadian postage stamp.  Career  L’Heureux specialized in portraits of children from 1857 to 1858. The business expanded to include three studios. After the partnership with Bienvenu, the business expanded to include calling cards and landscapes in addition to portraits. Many of the studio's works are now owned by the Musée Nationale des Beaux-arts du Québec. The studio had its works featured in L’Opinion Publique and in Canadian Illustrated News. The partnership with Bienvenu was dissolved in April 1873. Jules Livernois, took over the studio until 1952. The studio went bankrupt in 1979.  Photographic techniques  L’Heureux employed various photographic techniques including daguerrotypeand collodion, or \\"wet-plate\\", process and stereoscopy. L’Heureux added color with aquatint and oil mediums.  Exhibitions  * L’Heureux's first exhibition was at the Nouvelle Galerie Historique in January 1866. A subsequent exhibition was held in July 1867 and featured a collection of portraits of celebrities. * L’Heureux's work is on display at the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec, the Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec, the Library and Archives Canada and the Canadian Women Artists History Initiative Documentation Centre in Quebec.  Death  L’Heureux died in Quebec City, Quebec, in January 1896. The Livernois family continues to be memorialized in place names in Quebec.

The game was played on April 1, 2018, at the Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio. The Notre Dame Fighting Irish defeated the Mississippi State Bulldogs to win their second national championship. The game was won on a made basket by Arike Ogunbowale with 0.1 seconds left on the clock—she made a similar shot with 1.0 second in the semifinal to defeat Connecticut, earning Notre Dame a berth in the championship. Participants =Mississippi State= The Mississippi State Bulldogs were led by sixth-year head coach Vic Schaefer. The Bulldogs opened their season by winning all 15 of their non-conference games, including three wins in the Cancún Challenge and two wins as a part of the Duel in the Desert (played in Paradise, Nevada), adding a win against the No. 9 Oregon Ducks. The Bulldogs entered SEC play ranked No. 5 in the nation, and never dropped below that ranking, as they finished the regular season 30–0, 16–0 in SEC play, including four wins over ranked conference opponents: No. 6 Tennessee, No. 15 Missouri, defending national champions No. 7 South Carolina, and No. 17 Texas A&M.; The Bulldogs were seeded first in the SEC tournament, where they defeated (9) Kentucky and (5) Texas A&M; en route to the championship game, where they fell to (2) South Carolina, 51–62 for their first loss of the season. The Bulldogs received an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament, where they were seeded first in the Kansas City regional. In the tournament, Mississippi State defeated (16) Nicholls State, (9) Oklahoma State, (4) NC State, and (3) UCLA en route to the Final Four, where they beat (1) Louisville in overtime, putting their record at 37–1. =Notre Dame= The Notre Dame Fighting Irish were led by 31st-year head coach Muffet McGraw. The Fighting Irish opened their season by winning eleven of their first twelve games, including three wins in the Gulf Coast Showcase and a win in the ACC–Big Ten Women's Challenge, with three of those four being ranked opponents, most notably defending champions No. 3 South Carolina. The Irish suffered their first loss in their eighth game of the season, a matchup with No. 1 Connecticut in the Jimmy V Classic. Notre Dame entered ACC play 11–1, ranked No. 2 in the nation. The Irish performed exceptionally in conference, finishing the regular season 27–2, with fifteen wins from sixteen ACC games, including three wins against ranked conference opponents (No. 8 Florida State, No. 19 Duke, and No. 21 NC State) and one win against a ranked non-conference opponent (No. 8 Tennessee). The Irish's only other loss of the season came against No. 3 Louisville in their fifth conference game; Notre Dame finished the season having won their last twelve games and were seeded second in the ACC tournament, where they defeated (7) Virginia and (3) Florida State en route to the title game, where they once again fell to Louisville. The Irish were seeded first as an at-large bid in the NCAA Tournament's Spokane Regional. On their run to the title game, Notre Dame defeated (16) Cal State Northridge, (9) Villanova, (4) Texas A&M;, and (2) Oregon to get to the Final Four, where they faced and defeated (1) Connecticut in overtime via a made basket by Arike Ogunbowale with 1.0 seconds left. The Irish reached this point despite a severely depleted roster with only seven scholarship players by the start of the NCAA tournament—four players missed part or all of the season to torn ACLs. Brianna Turner, an All-American forward in 2016–17, suffered the injury in the 2017 NCAA tournament and missed the entire season. Senior guard Mychael Johnson was lost in a preseason practice, freshman center Mikayla Vaughn after six games, and starting senior point guard Lili Thompson was lost on New Year's Eve. Before the title game, McGraw told media, \\"I didn't think we'd have more ACL tears than losses. I think it's just an amazing accomplishment for this team and the resilience they've shown all year.\\" Game summary Media coverage The Championship Game was televised in the United States by ESPN. Adam Amin gave the play-by-play, with Kara Lawson and Rebecca Lobo as the color analysts, and Holly Rowe as the sideline reporter.

An autodidact, Ghelli's early influences were informalism and geometric abstraction, from which he developed a cartoon-like style of figuration inspired by pop art and Surrealism. Ghelli was said to draw on affect over intellect, working personal interests and relations, and, later, dreams into his pictures; the Italian word racconto (narrative or story) often appears in the artist's titles.  Debut and early work (1962-1978)  At age 17 Ghelli began to frequent the studios of several contemporary Florentine painters and soon met the avant-garde art dealer Fiamma Vigo (Italian). Through Vigo's Numero gallery, Ghelli discovered a community of artists and writers who strongly influenced his approach to painting. Ghelli debuted in 1963 with two works on canvas in a group exhibition at Vigo's Numero gallery in Milan. He continued to exhibit his work in Vigo's galleries in Florence and Venice into the late 1960s. In 1972 Ghelli signed a contract with the Sangallo gallery in Florence; the associated stipend allowed him to paint full-time. = Il portapaesaggi (The Landscape Carrier) = From 1973 Ghelli's works tended increasingly towards figuration, with crudely drawn elements of landscape (hills, patches of sky, a line of trees at the horizon), road signage, mechanical elements and humanoid-robot figures. In 1974 he published the pocket volume Il portapaesaggi with text by the contemporary art historian Lara-Vinca Masini. In 1975 Ghelli's paintings were exhibited in New York and Los Angeles and in 1977 Ghelli returned to New York to exhibit his work and travel cross-country. Starting in 1978 Arezzo-based Novart produced a line of jewelry based on Il portapaesaggi.  Sentiment and narrative (1980-1989)  From 1980 a \\"narrative dimension\\" emerged in Ghelli's prints and paintings. The sparsely-drawn hills, robots, and signage of the previous decade are joined by envelopes, houses, and the occasional hand-written phrase. In her text describing the paintings in Ghelli's 1983 Ferrara exhibition the critic Maria Luisa Frisa noted \\"The theme of romantic love ... in all its facets: desire, jealously, abandonment, distance.Giuliano Ghelli, catalog curated by Maria Luisa Frisa, p. 3, 1983, printed by Fotolito Toscana (Archive of Lara- Vinca Masini, Centro d'arte contemporanea Luigi Secci, Prato, Italy) The interplay of narrative, landscape and technological artifact in Ghelli's work was commented by the art historian Lara-Vinca Masini in her 1989 Arte Contemporanea, noting, in Ghelli's paintings, a \\"lucid, fable-like transcription of technology and robots.\\"  Mature work (1990–2014)  = Mechanical themes: Leonardo and Mercedes-Benz = In 1990 Ghelli was introduced to the Leonardo scholar Carlo Pedretti, then professor of art history at UCLA. From meetings with Pedretti followed a set of silkscreens and then paintings inspired by Leonardo da Vinci, culminating in the 1992 exhibition In viaggio con Leonardo in Milan. Ghelli would continue to reference Leonardo's work, in particular the illustrations of the Codex Leicester, in several works from the 1990s onwards. Ghelli's Leonardo paintings were noticed by Jochen Prange, the head of Mercedes-Benz Italia S.p.A., and led to a commission for twenty paintings for the company's new Rome headquarters, which hosted a one-man exhibition for the artist in 1995. = The Aborigeni, Migrazioni, and Esercito di terracotta = Many of Ghelli's canvases from the late 1990s are densely packed with color and form. In his text \\"Ghelli's 'Horror Vacui'\\", Carlo Pedretti characterized this period's style as \\"painting that does not allow empty space\\" linking it to the workings of the subconscious and dreams. In 2000, a trip to Sydney, Australia and a reading of Bruce Chatwin's novel The Songlines led Ghelli to paint series of canvases referencing Aboriginal symbols and Dreamtime. In this same period the artist painted a series of works on paper and canvas depicting shoals of fish, each with the title \\"Migrazione\\". These series were cited by some critics as evidencing Ghelli's interest in dreams and in the ancestral and unchanging. Ghelli's Esercito di terracotta (Terracotta Army) resulted from the artist extending his practice of painting fabric tailors busts to sculpting and decorating pre-fabricated, fresh clay forms. Through carving, stamping, and the application molded shapes, Ghelli created approximately fifty small terracotta female busts (each 25 cm high) soon followed by a larger series (about 75 cm high). Some journalists and public figures associated the work to the partially-excavated Terracotta Army of Xi'an. = The \\"Cantiere\\" and the Segreti = In 2011 the artist created an art lab for secondary school students called the \\"Cantiere Giuliano Ghelli\\" (Ghelli work site). Concurrently, Ghelli had been experimenting with twine wrapped around his pieces, one of which he brought into the art lab. Ghelli invited the students to \\"write on a small piece of canvas … a phrase no one would ever read\\". Each such piece was then \\"folded ... soaked in glue, placed under the twine and covered with paint.\\" The resulting painted tailor's bust belongs to a series of mixed media works called \\"Segreti\\" (Secrets) made between 2011 and 2014.

Wallis traveled all over the world, observing art, studying sculpture and advancing her artistic career. She is best known for bronze sculptures of animals and infants. Early life Katherine Wallis was born in 1861 outside Peterborough, Ontario in a small town called Merino. Although Wallis, and her sister Adah, grew up on a farm they were encouraged to pursue their art. Each member of the Wallis family was artistically gifted including her mother who enjoyed music and singing. Wallis' role models were her mother's friends, including Catharine Parr Traill, her sister Susanna Moodie and the painter Anne Langton. For a brief time, Wallis attended the Toronto Art School known today as OCAD University, but in the late 1800s there were few options for women practicing art professionally. During this time women were not permitted to take life drawing classes with nude models. Langton told the Wallis sisters, \\"If you wish to obtain your dream, you cannot stay here.\\" At this early time, Katherine Wallis had not yet realized she was interested in sculpture, but understood that opportunities for female artists in Canada were limited.  Education and career in Europe (1878–1938)  = Scotland (1878–1880) = Wallis and her sister traveled to Scotland to visit family. She enrolled in the Edinburgh School of Arts in 1878. While she was a copyist at the Scottish National Gallery she was able to earn a living making copies of famous art works. In 1880, Wallis' mother became ill and the sisters returned home to take care of the farm. After staying in Canada and caring for the farm for the next thirteen years, Katherine Wallis had the freedom and financial stability to return to Europe. = London (1893–1899) = When Wallis was 32, she returned to Europe with her sister, Adah. They settled in Dresden, Germany and spent two years travelling Europe, viewing famous paintings, sculptures and architecture. In 1895, Katherine Wallis enrolled in the London's Royal College of Art, RCA. Wallis was taught by French born sculptor Édouard Lantéri, a former pupil of Jacques-Louis David. While working with Lantéri, Wallis realized her passion for sculpture. Lantéri also taught her the \\"New Sculpture,\\" which consisted of small scale bronzes of domestic subjects, including women and small animals. While studying at the RCA School of Design she was awarded the RCA Bronze Medal. In 1897, she received the Modeller's Free Scholarship, which allowed her to continue her studies for two more years until she decided to move to Paris. La Lutte pour la Vie from Collin's Biographical Sketch =Paris (1899–1939) = In Paris, Wallis focused on creating sculpture; specifically she enjoyed sculpting animals she observed at the Zoo. She met Oscar Waldmann in Paris at Jardin des plantes, which functions as a modern-day Zoo. He encouraged her to submit one of her sculptures at the Exposition Universalle, which added to the recognition of her art. Wallis also exhibited her work at the spring salon in Paris over the next few years. At this time, Wallis was studying animals and sculpting them into stone, marble and bronze. Wallis met Auguste Rodin in 1902. He encouraged her to sketch sculptures she saw at the Louvre. Rodin praised her figures' solid construction. Rodin wanted to see more of her work, but Wallis declined because her work was too hard to transport for his viewing, and because she already had great mentors like Lantéri and Waldmann. In 1914, when World War I broke out, Wallis did not continue sculpting, but focused on the war efforts as a nurse in a Canadian Hospital in Paris. Her art was meant to be exhibited at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, but due to the war this was postponed. Once World War I ended, Wallis returned to her artistic career. In 1929, she became the first Canadian elected as the Sociétaire of the Société National des Beaux-Arts for her sculpture La Lutte Pour la Vie. In 1920, she spent three years exhibiting works in Peterborough, Ontario before she returned to Paris. She also spent five months in Bosnia and Greece, working in relief and water colour. She sent works to England and within one year she exhibited her sculptures in London, Liverpool, Leeds and Glasglow. In 1936, when World War II broke out, she fled to California, which became her home for the rest of her life.  Santa Cruz (1939–death)  Katherine Wallis' Santa Cruz Studio from Collin's Biographical Sketch The Santa Cruz Art League offered Wallis a personal exhibition, which she accepted. Wallis had a statewide show in the Santa Cruz Auditorium. Wallis was made a member of the National Society for Sanity in Art, which allowed her to exhibit once a year in San Francisco and Chicago. Through this society, she received a prize for Excellence in Sculpture, an award she won twice. In 1944 Wallis showed her sculptures Coming Always Nearer and Speed at the Santa Cruz Art League's Fifteenth Annual Exhibition. Later that year, she created a piece called Victory; a woman who smiles as she carries a dove while holding an olive branch.  Notable works and accomplishments  Wallis has exhibitions at the Royal Academy in London during 1897, the Royal Canadian Academy from 1904–1937 and the National Gallery of Canada in 1928. Wallis received an honorable mention for her sculpture at the Exposition Universalle. She was not only an exceptional sculptor, but a painter and a poet. Wallis' poems were published as a collection entitled Chips from the Block. In 1947, the National Gallery of Canada purchased Wallis' most famous sculpture La Lutte pour la Vie. Upon her death, she bequeathed her art collection to the City of Peterborough and it is now part of the Peterborough Museum and Archives.

Location  Aerial view of Kaufingerstraße (top left) to Marienplatz (middle bottom) The Kaufingerstraße borders on the west with the Marienplatz and is part of the large west-east axis of the historic old town. It is part of the Salzstraße from Salzburg or Reichenhall via Landsberg to Switzerland. It begins at the Marienplatz and ends at the intersection Färbergraben / Augustinerstraße, which follow approximately the location of the moat of the city's fortifications. Its extension is called Neuhauser Straße.  History  The Michaelskirche, located on the left of Neuhauser Straße with a view of Kaufingerstraße in Munich, 1839 View of the Frauenkirche (left) and the Kaufingerstraße (right), around 1910 View in winter The Kaufingerstraße is probably named after the patrician Chunradius Choufringer, who is historically mentioned for the first time in a document dated 28 May, 1239. He owned a representative house in Kaufingerstraße. For a while, one assumed the name came from a place called \\"Kaufing\\", which, however, could never be confirmed. = Development = The Kaufingerstraße already had a special position as part of the Salzstraße in the town of Leone. Soon, Munich merchants set up their homes here. The \\"Obere Tor\\" (Upper Gate) was considered a particularly representative construction that shaped the building ensembles. The \\"Obere Tor\\" was soon named \\"Chufringer Tor\\", before it established itself and received the name \\"Schöner Turm\\" (pretty tower). Even before the first written mention in 1316, the street was named Chufringerstraße. Therefore, the Kaufingerstraße next to the Rindermarkt is considered the street with the oldest name of Munich. In the 19th century, the baroque residential buildings of the Munich merchants were replaced by department stores. The largest business building \\"Zum Schönen Turm\\" is today the \\"Hirmer Herrenbekleidungshaus\\" (Hirmer men’s clothing house). During the Second World War, the fabric of the Kaufingerstraße was largely destroyed and finally demolished. In the 1990s and the years following, the buildings of the 1950s and 1960s were again replaced by postmodern buildings. The Kaufingerstraße has always been a very important traffic axis. Since 1972, it has been part of the pedestrian zone in the center of Munich. For this purpose, the Altstadtring was built to direct the traffic around the old town. As a result, the old section of the tram lines from Karlsplatz (Stachus) to Isartor shut down. As an additional traffic axis, the main line of the Munich S-Bahn was opened in the same year under Kaufingerstraße. With an average of 12,975 passers-by per hour (as of 5 May 2011), Kaufingerstraße is one of the top-selling shopping streets in Germany. The rental and construction site purchase prices are the highest in the Kaufingerstraße than in any other street in Germany. Rental prices are around 300 € and site purchase prices around 50,000 € per square meter (in 2008). In 2008, the street was one of the 10 shopping miles (9th place) with the highest rents in the world. In 2010, it was, with 11.905 passers-by per hour, in third place of the busiest shopping streets in Germany. In 2011, the Kaufingerstraße slipped to number 4 of the most visited shopping streets in Germany behind the Zeil in Frankfurt am Main (13,035 passers-by per hour). Meanwhile, the Neuhauser road placed second in the list. According to a study by Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), it was the busiest street in Munich with 13,515 passers-by per hour on the deadline. Also in 2013, the Neuhauser Straße placed second with 11,920 passers-by, this time behind the Dortmunder Westenhellweg (12,950 passers-by). Because of this, Munich is the only German city, which has 2 shopping streets in the list of the most visited five. According to an analysis by JLL from the year 2015, Kaufingerstraße is the most expensive shopping street in Germany with a top rent of 360 Euro per square meter.

On display at the Museo Diocesano in Fermo, the chasuble is among the possessions of the treasury of the Fermo Cathedral (Duomo di Fermo). It was donated by Presbitero, bishop of Fermo (1184-1201), who, scholar David Storm Rice suggests, had received it from Thomas Becket himself, when they were both students at the Studium of Bologna. Other sources dispute this claim, and instead suggest that the chasuble was donated by the Cult of Saint Thomas as they passed through Fermo. The textile is one few surviving from the Medieval period, and is believed to one of the oldest examples of Islamic embroidery used for a Christian purpose. This textile also serves as evidence to corroborate a coexistence between the Middle East and Europe during the Medieval period. Most modern knowledge of the chasuble is credited to the efforts of Professor of Islamic Art and Architecture at the University of London, David Storm Rice and textile conservator, Sigrid Müller Christensen, through their collaborative research efforts in the 1950s.  History  Stained glass window of Thomas Becket in Canterbury CathedralSt. Thomas Becket was born in December, 1118 to devout Catholic merchant parents in Cheapside, London. As an adult he began his work as an accountant for three years. He was then introduced to Archbishop Theobald and joined his household. During his time there, he and the Archbishop became close and he was sent to study civil and canon law in Italy and France. In 1154, he was appointed the Archdeacon of Canterbury and, three months later, King Henry II appointed him chancellor. As chancellor he grew very close with the king and was known for living a lavish, expensive lifestyle. However, after being elected Archbishop of Canterbury a year after Theobald’s death in 1161, he became very pious and began disagreeing with the king on many issues. Their relationship became quarrelsome to the point that King Henry II exiled him between November, 1164 and December, 1170. At the end of his exile, four knights, inspired by the words of King Henry, killed him on December 29th, 1170. Three years later, he was canonized by Pope Alexander III. It is said that after his burial at the Canterbury Cathedral, miracles began taking place at the site. According to John of Salisbury, a friend of St. Thomas and one of his biographers, paralytics, blind, deaf, and mute people, and lepers were cured and the dead were resurrected at St. Thomas’ burial sites. These accounts inspired the Knights of St. Thomas, whose followers would later become the Knights Hospitaller, to found a church and hospital dedicated to Thomas Becket. Large numbers of pilgrims began traveling to Canterbury to pray or be healed. The chasuble is said to have been a relic as it was the garment Becket was buried in 1170, however other sources dispute if the textile was even fashioned into the Chasuble during Becket's life. Simon-Cahn provides evidence that perhaps the Chasuble was created after Becket’s death to emulate the Chasuble he was buried in, and this garment gained notoriety from the Cult of Saint Thomas Becket, which was increasing in size at that time. The exact provenance of the object is not known, but it appeared in Fermo, Italy as a reliquary under the rebuilding of the cathedral in Fermo under Bishop Presbitero.  Description  Originally preserved inside a wooden box decorated in gold with gemstones, the semi-circular chasuble is 1,6 m high and has a circumference of 5,41 m. It is made of light-blue and white silk and decorated in gold and red thread embroidery. The embroidery consists of 34 large roundels interlinked with smaller roundels and eight-pointed stars. The large roundels on the outside of the garment show representations of peacocks, two winged lion griffins, four eagle griffins, frontal eagles with spread wings, confronted birds, confronted winged lions, some rapacious birds atop gazelles, a winged sphinx, and fragments of other animals. There are also representations of elephants with howdahs, one with women inside; four groups of turbaned hunters holding falcons seated on horses with rabbits below, and two enthroned men flanked by musicians and other attendants, all of which portray scenes of the Princely Cycle, a common theme in Islamic art. An oblong panel with a lavish scroll contains this Kufic inscription: \\"In the name of Allah the Merciful, the Compassionate, the kingdom is Allah's...greatest blessing, perfect health and happiness to its owner...in the year 510 in Mariyya\\". The chasuble is constructed from a textile which has been concluded once served a different purpose. Thirty-eight different panels fashion the chasuble, and are arranged in a patchwork manner to construct the bell-shaped garment. The chasuble is made up of different parts sewn together with red silk; some portions were sewn before the embroidery process, others afterwards, making the embroidery itself discontinuous. There is also no clear border to the textile. Potential original uses for the textile have been suggested as a canopy or tent cloth.  Arabic inscriptions  Due to age, deterioration, and differences of interpretation, the exact translation of the Arabic on this textile is unknown. A majority of the supposed Arabic script on the chasuble is indecipherable, due to the style of calligraphy and the degradation of the silk and embroidery. Historians and translators that have worked on the chasuble do agree on the religious undertones of the written Arabic, specifically the recurrence of the written word الله, Allah. There is also evidence to suggest the presence of pseudo-Arabic script, common at the time in art objects attempting to appear worldly. The Arabic script is written in a floriated Kufic calligraphy style, common to the Fatimid Era. However, historian Isabella Dolezeal accredits the creation of the original textile to a workshop in Islamically ruled Spain, and historian David Jacoby credits at least one panel of the textile to Almeria, Spain specifically. This in part with the animal imagery commonly found during the Fatimid and Norman periods, eastern Mediterranean, and Central Asia, and the object eventual presence in Fermo, supports the evidence of a globally connected middle ages. Shalem’s book on the chasuble includes a chapter on the Arabic Inscription, with a translation by Mohamed Adb el-Rahim. His version includes the Bismillah prayer from the Quran, but the remainder of his translation is contested due to anachronistic and a-geographical language factors. Dolezeal also suggests that due to the specific style of the Arabic calligraphy, it is unclear if the writing on the fabric registered to the christians that issued the chasuble as Arabic script.  Studies  The chasuble is a major example of the process of the Christianisation of an Islamic textile; this Arabic inscription on the chasuble allows scholars to ascribe the textile to a laboratory working during the Islamic period in Spain. The Christianisation process is proven both by the fact that the textile became a garment used in Christian liturgy and by its association with the worship of Thomas Becket as a saint and martyr, which spread all over Europe during the 13th century. Early modern research done on the chasuble is somewhat limited, and looks primarily at the garment for its basic elements- cloth, silk, embroidery. Professor David Storm Rice, from University of London, studied the chasuble extensively and was the first to detect and decipher the inscription on the textile. Working together from 1958- 1960 with textile historian Sigrid Müller-Christensen, they compiled what is known today as the Fermo File, which is now stored in the archives of the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum. This report includes physical and historical research on the chasuble. Müller-Christensen was responsible for creating the first modern rendering of the Chasuble in 1973, and her diagrams are still the primary resource when analyzing the chasuble. Furthermore, due to its importance and exceptional state of preservation, the chasuble has undergone thorough analysis by the art historian Avinoam Shalem with the publication of his book, The Chasuble of Thomas Becket: A Biography, in 2017, who studied the textile and its history in collaboration with the Bruschettini Foundation, Germano Liberati, Birgitt Borkopp-Restle, Regula Schorta, Miriam Ali-de- Unzaga, Ariane Dor, David Jacoby, Ursula Nilgen, and Marta Jaro.

He was a pioneer in describing the Kaurna language, after his work begun at the Piltawodli Native Location in Adelaide, with fellow-missionary Clamor Wilhelm Schürmann. Life Teichelmann came from humble origins. He was born in the Saxon village of Dahme (part of Prussia from 1815), the son of a master clothmaker, and, after an early schooling, was apprenticed as a carpenter's assistant at the age of 14. After several years practising his trade in Saxony and Prussia, he took private lesson to qualify for entry into the Royal Building Trades School in Berlin, where he studied from 1830 to 1831. During this period Teichelmann, after mixing with students who had missionary contacts, enrolled in Jaenicke's Mission school in 1831, where Clamor Wilhelm Schürmann was a fellow-student. There he received a thorough education in Latin, Greek, Hebrew and English, together with theological and historical studies. Teichelmann and Schürmann then enrolled in the Evangelical Lutheran Mission Society's seminary at Dresden in 1836, obtaining their ordination as Lutheran pastors in early 1838. Later that year they travelled to Australia on the Pestonjee Bomanjee, arriving in Adelaide on 12 October. One of their fellow passengers happened to be George Gawler who was there to take up his appointment as the new Governor of South Australia. Missionary work Notable problems arose when the evangelical Gawler, an evangelical enthusiast himself who had proven supportive of their work, was replaced by George Grey, who insisted rather that aboriginal people be instructed only in English, preferably in schools run by the state. The German missionaries at the time were the only ones thoroughly at home in native languages and gifted with a practical empathy for the customs and modes of Aboriginal life.

Akulukjuk was born in 1915 (though some sources state 1912 and 1921), and lived a traditional Inuit life in the Qikiqtat Camp of Nunavut before moving to Pangnirtung on Baffin Island in 1962. Her career as an artist started later than most, at the age of 51. In 1969, the Canadian Federal Department of Indian and Northern Affairs opened the Pangnirtung Weave Shop with the aim of creating a craft industry in the community. With Akulukjuk's guidance her drawings were translated onto the woven tapestries by fellow members of the Pangnirtung Weave Shop. Many of Akulukjuk's works were inspired by her memories of traditional life which revolve around camping and family gatherings, and the others were rooted from her imagination of mystical creatures. A large collection of Akulukjuk's drawings went on exhibitions across Canada. Some of Akulukjuk's pieces such as Inuit Ways (1979) and Hunting Polar Bears with Harpoon (1982) are displayed in the National Gallery of Canada and various museums across the country. The Heffel Gallery, one of Canada's fine art auction houses, sells Akulukjuk's works as well as the tapestries of weaver Agah Etooangat based on Akulukjuk's drawings. Akulukjuk's art is crucial to the development of Inuit weaving tapestry by visualizing the old Inuit life and shamanism.  Early life  Malaya Akulukjuk was born in Quikitat Camp (a former Whaling station) in 1915 (though some sources state 1912 and 1921). She married at the age of twenty. In the Inuit society, arranged marriages were a tradition to ensure all marriageable adults could have partners during their childbearing years. Akukuljuk became a mother to thirteen children. While pregnant, she continued hunting and participating in land. She moved later to the settlement in Pangnirtung on Baffind Island with her husband and children in 1960.  Personal Life and Family  Akulukjuk got married at the early age of twenty, which was much against her will. In the Inuit society, arranged marriages was a tradition to ensure that all marriageable adults could have partners during their childbearing years. Akulukjuk became a mother of thirteen children, but she did not give up hunting in her pregnancy, and sometimes she went hunting by carrying a baby in her hood. Akulukjuk's late husband, Nutaralaq Akulukjuk, was a sculpture artist. Several of his works had been sold at auctions, including Man Drinking sold at Waddington's Inuit Art Online Auction in 2017. Many of Akulukjuk's children became future artists in Pangnirtung, including five of her sons, Jeetaloo, Geeshee, Juelee, Enukee and Moar. Her daughter, May Lonsdale, developed into a graphic artist. In Akulukjuk's adult life, she suffered from poor eyesight, and sometimes she had to use magnifying glasses to create paintings.  Pioneer Artist at the Pangnirtung Tapestry Studio  The Aboriginal people of the Canadian Arctic have led a semi-nomadic lifestyle for centuries by living off the land. This nomadic lifestyle meant there was no continuous center for economic and community life. During the Resettlement Period in the 1960s, Canada's Inuit were relocated changing their lifestyle significantly. To aid in this process the Canadian government funded art and crafts initiatives across the Arctic region and contracted companies to administer and run these programs. Karen Bulow LTD, a weaving company from Montreal, created the Pilot Weaving Program for the Pangnirtung community. In 1970 the project manager Donald Stuart and three woman employees arrived to train and begin the program. The women quickly learned the hand-weaving techniques and moved onto the loom weaving creating linear patterns and items like sashes, hats and blankets. Many of the woman being leaders in the community easily understood weaving partly because of the finger weaving introduced by missionaries in the 1930-40s and the traditional Inuit culture of creating clothing and everyday items out of items from the land. In celebration of the centennial year of the Northwest Territories, Queen Elizabeth II visited Iqualuit and was given a Pangnirtung Weave Shop blanket. Stuart recalls the Queen remarking how cold it was and \\"that when the blanked was presented she put it on and wrapped it around her knees right away…\\" Prince Philip reached over to touch and she said \\"No, it’s mine!\\" The pilot weaving program was proving to be successful and positively impacting the surrounding community but the cost of running it the program too high for the small items being sold. The goods produced in the Pangnirtung Weave Shop did not have the ‘Inuit look’ which is what customers wanted from Northern goods. The program directors looked to government initiatives and the markets for such goods and decided woven wall hangings or tapestries would be the best for economic profit of the program. To make the tapestries they needed original Inuit drawings to translate into the woven textiles. Stuart took paper and pens throughout the community asking elders if they wanted to draw. Malaya Akulukjuk was one of the first artists discovered, she was 51. Her drawings set the precedent of what types and style of art was to be showcased on the tapestries. Other artists included Annie Pitsiuluk, Annie Kilabuk and Elisapee Ishulutak. The first exhibition of the Pangnirtung tapestries was on March 28, 1971 in Montreal. All 23 tapestries sold to private collectors and museums. The Pangnirtung Weave Shop was moved into the Uqqurmiut Inuit Artists Association Centre which created a central management of all arts and crafts. The centre merges the Print Shop, Tapestry Studio, Retail Craft Gallery and an office for administration under one roof. The creation of the Pangnirtung Weave Shop has been a successful and helpful tool bridging the gap between the Inuit living off the land and living in settlements. The art was a source of cultural identity and pride but also an economic source for the region. The Federal Development of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada in 2001 estimates that 20% of the Inuit derive part of their income from the arts and crafts programs. Without the work at the Weave Shop or other arts and crafts programs many would be solely reliant on social assistance money.  Works and Shamanism  Unlike many other traditional cultures, women were significantly powerful in the Inuit religion because they took leading roles in spiritual matters. Although Malaya Akulukjuk did not openly acknowledge her identity, she was reputed as a shaman in the Pangnirtung community. Shamans are people with special powers that enable them to act as a mediator between the spiritual world and the temporal world, and they have helping spirits to assist them with supernatural tasks. In Inuit communities, people believe that a shaman is able to maintain the spirit's favour by appropriately practicing her unique abilities, including her power of second sight, her \\"X-ray\\" vision, and her control of animal spirits.Emily E, Auger, The Way of Inuit Art: Aesthetics and History in and Beyond the Arctic (Jefferson, N.C: McFarland, 2005), 40. Shamanism is based on the animistic belief that a helping spirit could exist in every being and take different forms, which are commonly seen in birds and polar bears.Swinton, George and William E. Taylor, \\"Prehistoric Doric Art: Discussion by an Archaeologist and an Artist.\\" The Beaver, Autumn 1967: 42. In Akulukjuk's drawings, she adopts the role of \\"artist as shaman\\" by vividly portraying her access to the spiritual world which is filled with transformative animals and supernatural beings. Her spirit figures are rooted from her imagination and the stories she had heard in childhood.\\"Malaya Akulukjuk (1915-1995), Inuit Artist Biography and Portfolio.\\" Spirit Wrestler Gallery. http://www.spiritwrestler.com/catalog/index.php?artists_id=370 (accessed March 6, 2018) In 1972, Akulukjuk's drawing Oalopalik depicts a helping spirit, which could possibly be her own.Deborah, Hickman. Nuvisavik: The Place Where We Weave. (Montreal, Quebec: Canadian Museum of Civilization, 2002), 54. During an interview with Asia Papatsie, the Inuit elder confirmed that this helping spirit was a bird that acted as the shaman's eyes. In Inuit beliefs, such a spirit could fly over long distance and report to the shaman what it had seen.Hickman, Nuvisavik: The Place Where We Weave, 54. In Akulukjuk's later artistic career, she started to depict complex themes with multiple characters, and those works continued to communicate her shamanistic beliefs. For instance, her drawing of Two Bears with Skin Frame in 1977 displays two polar bear spirits that live in a different dimension. These spirits are viewed as bear people, who hunt like the Inuit but usually live inside a paddle or a rock.Hickman, Nuvisavik: The Place Where We Weave, 58. In this drawing, the bear people are stretching an animal skin that may have been later used to sew skin clothes. Akulukjuk's other drawings involve human interactions with birds, and animal spirits that co-exist with humans on the Inuit landscapes. In her drawing Lady with Birds (1977), Akulukjuk depicts a girl who plays with her bird that she may has been tamed from a young age. The girl's hairstyle reveals that she is not married yet.Hickman, Nuvisavik: The Place Where We Weave, 60. Here, Akulukjuk emphasizes the intimacy between human and animal spirits, which reflects her shamanistic practices because she has personal interactions with those spirits. In Akulukjuk's another drawing, Malaya’s Story (1981), Inuit people and animal spirits are depicted in the same space. While community members are preparing for hunting and food storage, the goose spirit is moving in his own directions. Akulukjuk presents her perspective as a shaman by visualizing the co-existence of everyday community life and the spiritual realm.  Community Life  In the Pangnirtung Tapestry Studio, the first generation of artists like Malaya Akulukjuk were mostly elders that had previously lived a traditional Inuit life.Maria von, Finckenstein. \\"…But I Always Think About the Old Days.\\" In Nuvisavik: The Place Where We Weave. (Montreal, Quebec: Canadian Museum of Civilization, 2002), 4. Akulukjuk was growing up in a whaling station, and lived as a nomadic hunter during her early years.\\"Malaya Akulukjuk (1915-1995), Inuit Artist Biography and Portfolio.\\" Spirit Wrestler Gallery. http://www.spiritwrestler.com/catalog/index.php?artists_id=370 (accessed March 6, 2018) When she adopted her artistic career, she viewed drawing as a way to pass on her rich knowledge of the \\"true Inuit life\\" to the younger generation.Deborah, Hickman. \\"Tapestry: A Northern Legacy\\" In Nuvisavik: The Place Where We Weave. (Montreal, Quebec: Canadian Museum of Civilization, 2002), 28. After the resettlement, drawing was a coping strategy for Akulukjuk to fulfil her responsibility as an elder. In the Tapestry Studio, the weavers are usually young girls in their early twenties and they learned the Inuit past from the elders by transforming their drawings into tapestries.Hickman, Tapestry: A Northern Legacy, 30. In the Inuit Quarterly, the writer states that Inuit elders produce \\"memory art\\" instead of commercial art.\\"Speaking for Themselves: Eight Inuit Artists Compare Notes During a Seminar Organized by the Inuit Art Foundation.\\", edited by Marybelle Mitchell. Inuit Art Quarterly 5, no. 2 (1990): 16. The elders were eager to tell stories of the past and traditional lifestyles because they were afraid of losing their own identity to the western cultural invasions. Akulukjuk enjoyed using her imagination and memories to present Inuit life of her youth, as well as natural landscapes with tiny human or animal figures. Many of her drawings reconstruct traditional Inuit community life. In 1981, the tapestry of Malaya’s Story demonstrated that the Inuit people used the whale's body to store food and make tools. They also used sled dogs for transportation, and carried some weapons in their hands when they went out hunting.Hickman, Nuvisavik: The Place Where We Weave, 66. The other painting, Children at Summer Camp (1980) revealed that Inuit people lived in sealskin tents during the summer. The young couple lives in a smaller tent that has seal skin boots drying on the poles, while the older couple lives in a bigger tent with a wooden door. The door indicates that the old couple has high status in their community (they are suggested to be prominent hunters) because wood is a very precious resource in the Inuit society.Hickman, Nuvisavik: The Place Where We Weave, 64. Akulukjuk's drawings also present her knowledge of land and wildlife in a practical sense. Some of her drawings are purely landscapes scenes of the old Inuit territories, including Spring Breakup (1995), Camp Site (1995) and Inukshuk Trail (1995). These landscape drawings were created at the end of Akulukjuk's life. The artist was eager to go back to these campsites, but she could no longer go out on the land.Hickman, Nuvisavik: The Place Where We Weave, 68. They revealed Akulukjuk's strong emotional connections and her long-lasting memories of the old Inuit lands. On the other hand, there are pure animal depictions such as Galloping Caribou (1994) and Playful Narwhales (1980) in Akulukjuk's drawings. These animals were commonly seen on the Inuit land, and they used to be the primary food resources for the survival of the community.  Cooperation Between Artists and Weavers  Tapestry weaving in Pangnirtung has always been a cooperative production that combined the skills of two parties, the drawing artists and the weavers. The submission of the drawing is done by one artist, while the interpretation of the drawing into the medium of tapestry is produced by another artist of the weaving shop. The tapestry artist would choose the colours of the final production, which is rarely discussed with the drawing artist since weavers are believed to have more knowledge about the effective use of colours.Cathleen, Knotsch, \\"Views of the Past.\\" In Nuvisavik: The Place Where We Weave. Montreal, (Quebec: Canadian Museum of Civilization, 2002), 24. Many of Akulukjuk's drawings were made into tapestries by different weavers, and the final productions changed the colours, sizes, and proportions of her original drawings. For instance, her drawing Children at Summer Camp (1980) was originally created with black and brown pen; while its rich and saturated colours were added by the tapestry artist, Kawtysee Kakee. Moreover, the original drawing has more defined lines, which clearly demonstrate how children engage in everyday activities such as brewing tea and cooking meat. However, in the tapestry production, the surface becomes rough, and the depictions of food are less detailed. The tapestry artist focuses on mixing the soft colours of the wool with a lighter thread, which creates the glow of warm evening light. By creating this natural light, the image is given a sense of time as well as a nostalgic feeling of beauty. Akulukjuk's drawing, Spring Break (1995) is painted by coloured pencils, which depicts the scene of mountains, valleys and ice fields being lightened by the rising sun. Akulukjuk uses soft colours to portray this scene, including light yellow, blue and white. They create a dreamy atmosphere, and evokes the impression of a paradise rooted from the artist's memory. Compared to the original drawing, the tapestry production adds more layers of perspective to the flat surface by incorporating vivid colours as well as making the mountains look sharp and outstanding.  National and International Exhibitions  Akulukjuk's works have been exhibited in galleries across Canada, including the National Gallery, the Inuit Gallery of Vancouver, the Arts and Crafts Guild of Quebec, the University of Alberta. They even went overseas, and reached as far as the Jerusalem Artists House Museum. Two of Akulukjuk's works, Inuit Ways (1979) and Hunting Polar Bears with Harpoon (1982) are displayed in the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa. The Heffel Gallery, one of Canada's fine art auction houses, sells Akulukjuk's works as well as the tapestries of weaver Agah Etooangat based on Akulukjuk's drawings.\\"Malaya Akulukjuk and Agah Etooangat Sale Results.\\" Heffel Fine Art Auction House. http://www.heffel.com/links/Sales_E.aspx?ID=585A5658 (accessed March 26, 2018)  References  Category:1915 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Inuit artists Category:Canadian Inuit women Category:20th-century women artists Category:Inuit textile artists Category:Inuit from the Northwest Territories Category:Women textile artists ","title":"Malaya Akulukjuk"},{"id":"56946655","text":"Ivy Hill Cemetery is a public cemetery located at 1201 Easton Road in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.

According to most sources, Melvin's date of birth was May 28, 1892; however, some sources state the year as 1896. Melvin has been noted as one of two women who were responsible for bringing modern calligraphy designs to Canada (the other being Esme Davis).  Education  Melvin began studying art at the Glasgow School of Art in 1907. She took classes in drawing, painting, and design, while also attending life classes. Her work was influenced by the Art Nouveau period in which she was creating, which had Pre-Raphaelite influences. Melvin studied under the guidance of Robert Anning Bell, Maurice Grieffenhager, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Caley Robinson, and Ann MacBeth. She graduated with honours in 1916 and received a post-graduate diploma with honours in 1918. Melvin discovered her passion for illumination whilst studying on scholarship to London's British Museum, and was given special permission to recreate some of the works.  Career  Melvin ended her studies at the Glasgow School of Art in 1918 and became a faculty member in 1920. Courses that she taught, between 1920 and 1927, included: * Lettering and Illumination (under Design and Decorative Art) (1920/1921) * Lettering and Illumination (under Pictorial Design and methods of production) (1926/1927) * History of Lettering and Illumination (1926/1927) Melvin also worked as a scribe for the Corporation of Glasgow, making illuminated addresses for significant people. She traveled to Vancouver, B.C., in 1927 for a two-year leave of absence from the Glasgow School of Art to help organize the Design Department at the Vancouver Art School. According to the Canadian Women Artists History Initiative, Melvin came to Canada at the request of her brother-in-law Charles H. Scott. However, there is seemingly no further mention of him in her life nor of any involvement in the Vancouver Art School. There, Melvin accepted a full-time position as the Head of the Design Department in 1929. She was interested in First Nations art and encouraged her students to use such art for inspiration in their own work. She retired from the Vancouver Art School in 1952 and became a full-time painter, while also publishing and illustrating numerous books. Her main passion was lettering and illumination, but she also created many landscape, garden and urban coastal scenes. The mediums that Melvin worked in included watercolor, oil, and ink.  Publications and Art Work  One of Melvin's most notable works is \\"The Books of Remembrance\\" for the Canadian Engineers of World War I that she created, which is on display in St Paul's Cathedral in London, England. She completed illustrations for many books by Marius Barbeau, including \\"The Indian Speaks\\" from 1943, and \\"Le Rêve de Kamalmouk\\" from 1948. Her book titled Basic Lettering for Art Students from 1930 is reportedly still used in instruction today. She had many books commissioned for the Department of Education of British Columbia, including the Student Manual and Workbook from 1949 and the Teacher's Manual: Containing in Full 'the Student Manual and Workbook' with a Suggested Approach.

Career Egevadluq Ragee’s interest in art began in 1959 while living in Tikerak when two other artists, Sheowak and Napatchie Pootoogook encouraged her to start drawing. From there Ragee began creating her early works, which were often drawn with graphite pencil on paper. Her drawings primarily feature mythical creatures, bird-animal-human transformations and scenes of traditional life in the Inuit. As her art developed, Ragee began experimenting with new mediums including acrylics, pen and ink, printmaking and wax crayon. Ragee’s drawing style has been recognized for its use of small, short strokes used to shade large spaces, which was uncommon for artists of this period. With this technique, Ragee could incorporate new textures into her artworks. In addition to her drawings, by 1970 Ragee began painting with acrylics, making her one of the first Inuit in Cape Dorset to work with that medium. Biography Egevadluq Ragee was born on October 30, 1920 near Cape Dorset, in the small camp of Ikirasak in Nunavut. Ragee lived with her parents, Pamiaktok and Sorisolutu until the birth of her sister when she began living with her grandparents in a nearby camp. Ragee’s first marriage was to Kootoo with whom she had a son and daughter, the latter dying early in infancy. Soon after their son’s death, Kootoo himself died from an undisclosed illness. When Ragee’s daughter reached four years of age, she remarried to Sakkiassie and they adopted four children together. Originally living in Nuvudjuak, the couple eventually moved their family to Tikerak, a camp eight miles from Cape Dorset. In 1967, Ragee and her family moved again to Cape Dorset in response to the improved housing conditions. Ragee continued to live and work there until her death on June 26, 1983. Honours and achievements Ragee is one of several artists whose reproductions are presented in folios by Mintmark Press Special Editions (Toronto). She is one of three artists who contributed to a special folio of work, documented in the Cape Dorset Graphic annual catalogue of 1982. (1982 ‘Etchings Portfolio V: Timiat’) In 1984 Egevadluq Ragee produced a folio of four prints, included in the Cape Dorset Graphic annual catalogue. Ragee was one of several artists whose work was acquired and released by Norgraphics Limited between 1976 and 1984. The works that were selected are documented in the Cape Dorset Graphic annual catalogue of 1986.

Background  Merasty was born in Beaver Lake, Saskatchewan, where she spent most of her life practicing and selling her artwork. Merasty was best known for her birchbark bitings, the Indigenous art practice of dentally perforating designs into folded sheets of thin bark. Birchbark biting is one of the oldest Indigenous art forms, historically practiced by women of the Subarctic and Northeastern Woodlands of Canada and the United States. While most birchbark biters created designs with lines, Merasty used a pointillist approach and created complex symmetrical images of flowers, insects, animals, and landscape sceneries. She died at the age of 66, and was one of the last recorded artists to maintain the Indigenous, traditional art of birchbark biting. Merasty's work was showcased in several Canadian museums including the Museum of Man and Nature and the Thunder Bay Art Gallery.  Personal life  Merasty grew up on an island in Beaver Lake in northern Saskatchewan, where she lived with her mother, Susan Ballantyne. She married Bill Merasty in 1947, who also assisted Angelique Merasty with her artistic practices. Together, they had one son named Joseph Merasty, who died 6 months after his birth due to an illness. By the time Angelique turned 50, her birchbark biting practice caused many of her teeth to fall out. She was however, able to get false teeth funded by the government, including 2 sharpened upper canines that were specifically designed to help Merasty continue her art. On 7 January 1996, Merasty died of a heart attack in Saskatoon.  Artistic career  = Methods and style = Merasty is best known for her birchbark bitings. Birchbark biting was historically a social past time, but in the 1950s, Merasty and her mother, Susan Ballantyne, began to sell their work at a summer resort near their home for 10 or 15 cents each. Merasty collected bark with the assistance of her husband, Bill Merasty. Together, they would travel by boat up to 15 miles away to find the best trees, which were white, smooth, clean, and at least 10 layers thick. The best season for harvesting bark was during the Spring time, when trees were thawing. Immediately after a harvest, was the ideal time to birchbark bite. Merasty’s process for creating each biting remained consistent. For each work, she folded a fresh layer of birch bark, two or more times, depending on the size and complexity of the work. Merasty would then rotate the folded shape by using her hands and tongue, while biting marks along its folds. Her designs usually began at the centre fold, and moved towards the outer edges. The pressure of her bites varied, resulting in a range of shades and surface textures. Her method of creating, produced intricate and symmetrical compositions. The sizes of her works were anywhere between seven-and-a-half centimetres, to around twenty-five centimetres. In Merasty’s early artistic practices, her designs were mostly geometric, but she later emerged with a unique style. She departed from established practices, by utilizing a pointillist approach for her bitings, rather than linear incisions. Merasty achieved complex, curvilinear designs, with a preference for flower and animal imagery. Later in her career, she was able to complete works from beginning to end without looking at her progress. = Exhibitions = Merasty’s art was showcased in many Canadian museums, including the Museum of Man and nature (1980) and the Thunder Bay Art Gallery (1983). Her work was also selected to be offered as a first prize for notable local and provincial cross country skiing competitions. Permanent displays of her work are on show at the Flin Flon Library as well as the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. Today, collectors pay thousands of dollars for her work.  Legacy  Angelique Merasty was one of the last practicing birch-biters recorded in North America during her time. She passed her teachings on to a woman named Angelique Merasty Levac, who lives in Manitoba. She is known for reviving the art or birch-bark biting, and there is now an estimate of 12 known people who continue this tradition in North America.

Gunterman started taking photos in the spring of 1897, mainly documenting her family and from that point forward her interest and skill in photography continued to grow. From the years 1899 to 1911, she served as a cook at a mining camp while also creating autobiographical photographs. She received some formal training about the basics of photography while growing up in La Crosse from her photographer uncle. Gunterman often included herself in her photographs creating a personal narrative of pioneer life in Canada and representing herself as a self-sufficient and confident leader. She contributed a notable historical record of the early 1900s mining boom in Lardeau, a former mining region located in the Kootenays region of British Columbia. In 1927, the Gunterman's home in Beaton was destroyed by a fire therefore much of her work was lost. The only existing work of Gunterman's are three photograph albums that currently belong to her grandson, Avery Gunterman and three hundred glass plate negatives that are part of the Vancouver Public Library collection. An exhibition of her work alongside Emily Carr’s was on display at the Vancouver Art Gallery from May 5 to September 3, 2018.  Personal life  = 1887 to 1889 = Mattie Gunterman was born in La Crosse, Wisconsin and not much is known about her family or childhood. An 1880 United States census provides confirmation that she lived with her grandmother and that her mother was born in Pennsylvania and her father was born in Michigan. She continuously battled health problems throughout her life. She learned photography from an uncle who had a studio in La Crosse. In 1889 she left La Crosse and moved west to Seattle, Washington. = 1889 to 1898 = She married William Gunterman, a candy maker in 1891 and the two had one son together, Henry, in 1892. She had consistent problems with her lungs and her health significantly weakened in 1896. In 1897 the Guntermans trekked to British Columbia to see about moving there permanently and along this trip she took some of her earliest photographs. Her health was a major factor that influenced her life and she was advised by her doctor to move to a drier climate. Thus her and her husband decided to permanently move from Seattle to Beaton, British Columbia, formerly known as Thomson's Landing in 1898. Although Gunterman continuously struggled with her health, she had a survivalist attitude and persevered through twelve- hour shifts at the mining cookhouses.  Career  Two miners drilling inside the Nettie L. mine in Ferguson. Gunterman mainly took photographs from 1897 to 1911. Her photographs were mainly taken in areas surrounding Beaton and the Arrow Lakes District of British Columbia as well as in the Pacific Northwest and California during her travels there in 1905. Typically during the winter months Gunterman would develop her glass plate negatives and turn them into prints. Initially, her primary purpose for taking photographs was to record her life, family and surroundings for her son Henry. She created her own autobiographical narrative through her photographs. In order to create self- portraits and to include herself in group photos, Gunterman would use a piece of rubber tubing attached to the camera's inflatable shutter at one end and a rubber bulb at the other to take the picture. The first camera that she used was a Bull's Eye snapshot camera. Her works at the start mainly consisted of posed group photos. She then purchased a No.5 Cartridge Kodak 4 x 5 plate camera in 1898 as it allowed for more versatility when playing with exposure, focusing and shutter speed. In 1902 Gunterman became the chef at the Nettie-L mine in the Lardeau region and at each long work shift she brought along her camera. She captured everyday life at the mine such as scenic views of the Lardeau region, men working hard in the mine and her fellow kitchen co- workers. Her photographs expose the gruelling work at the mine but also focus on more lighthearted aspects such as games they would play. Mining operations such as the Nettie-L and other surrounding mines totally ceased by 1905. However within the Kootenays logging activity increased and became another subject for Gunterman to photograph. Her work is essential for understanding life during the mining boom in the early 1900s. Furthermore, her photographs of both mining and logging activity are fundamental for understanding the jobs that drove the Canadian economy during the turn of the century. Gunterman's work is also some of the only photographic evidence of these mining towns when they were flourishing. In present-day these towns do not exist therefore her photographs serve to remember this region when it was prosperous and thriving.  Later years and legacy  During the late 1910s and into the 1920s when Beaton had become a quieter area, Gunterman, along with her husband Will worked as travelling cooks in nearby areas. In 1927, the Guntermans home burned down therefore many of her photographs were destroyed. However, a number of glass plate negatives and a few albums were stored elsewhere so they survived. Gunterman died in 1945 and three of her photograph albums are currently in the possession of her grandson, Avery Gunterman. Ron D’Altroy of the Vancouver Public Library became interested in Gunterman's work in 1961 and rediscovered three hundred of her glass plate negatives in Henry Gunterman's attic. After collecting these photographs and gaining permission to keep them, the Vancouver Public Library Board digitized her photographs. Her photographs help to reveal life in the Kootenays region of British Columbia, which does not exist today. Gunterman's work continues to gain more attention as it has become more accessible to the public through its digitization. From April 28 to September 3, 2018 her work was displayed alongside Emily Carr's at the Vancouver Art Gallery in an exhibition entitled \\"Emily Carr in Dialogue with Mattie Gunterman.\\"  References  __FORCETOC__ Category:1872 births Category:1945 deaths Category:Canadian women photographers Category:People from Wisconsin ","title":"Mattie Gunterman"},{"id":"56946739","text":"Mathilde Flögl (9 September 1893 - 1958) was an Austrian artist and designer.

Currently, the Viennese Museum of Applied Arts houses over 1,600 of Flögl's works from when she was involved with the Wiener Werkstätte. Among these are many independent works and collaborations with other individuals in the group. Notable members of the Wiener Werkstätte include two of its founders Josef Hoffman and Koloman Moser as well as Gustav Klimt, among others. For the group's 25th anniversary, Flögl amassed, arranged, wrote, and published, The Wiener Werkstatte, 1903-1928: The Evolution of the Modern Applied Arts. The book itself was a work of art using elaborate materials and decoration in its pages. The group's finances were always precarious because of their use of these costly materials but in 1929 the Wiener Werkstätte disbanded due to bankruptcy with the stock market crash that same year. In 1931, Flögl began a studio of her own which she operated for four years. Flögl was also a member of the Wiener Frauenkunst (Viennese Women's Art), a group of female artists working in Vienna. Flögl's work is currently in museums around the world including the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, The Kyoto Costume Institute in Kyoto, and the Museum of Applied Arts in Vienna, among others.  Life and schooling  Mathilde Flögl was born on 9 September 1893 in Brno, Czech Republic. Between 1909–16, she studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule (School of the Applied Arts) in Vienna. During her education, Flögl focused on applied graphics and enamelling taught by Josef Hoffman and Oskar Strnad among others. Flögl died in 1958 in Salzburg, Austria.  Flögl and the Wiener Werkstätte  Flögl joined the Wiener Werkstätte (Vienna Workshop) in 1916, an artist collective focusing on refinement of material and integrating art into all aspects of life. Their pieces were made both independently and on commission. The collective was formally registered as “Wiener Werkstätte, Productivgenossenschaft von Kunsthandwerkern in Wien, Genossenschaft mit unbeschränkter Haftung” (Vienna Workshops manufacturing co-operative of artist craftsmen in Vienna, co-operative with unlimited liability) in 1903 by Josef Hoffman, Koloman Moser, and Fritz Waerndorfer. The workshop had conflicting views on its integration of women artists. It was known to many as a space for women to produce art without the burden of the male gaze. The majority of women in the collective were paid as much as their male counterparts. Yet, a critic describes the Wiener Werkstaette workshop in Döblergasse: “When one entered the ateliers in the Döblergasse, one saw little of the men directing the whole thing… but the young women-artists in their white smocks zipped through the whole building, populating all of its stories. If one searched for them in the workplaces, one found them either at the drawing table with a textile-design sketch, or occupied with embroidery or a poster, or else busy as ceramicist at the pottery wheel.” - Hans Ankwicz-Kleehoven Flögl joined the workshop in its second iteration when the original Wiener Werkstäette liquidated in 1914 due to difficulty in selling their work and thus a lack of funding. The renewed Wiener Werkstaette, now called “Betriebsgesellschaft m.b.H. der Wiener Werksatte Productivegenossenschaft für Gegenstände des Kunstgewerbes” (Vienna workshops manufacturing cooperative for handicraft objects Ltd.) was under the direction of Philipp Hauser, Hoffman's colleague, and supported by the Primavesi family who owned 33% of the company's shares. The collective worked in furniture, glass, ceramics, silver and metalwork, jewellery, fashion, graphic design, among other mediums. They opened shops in Switzerland and the USA. Flögl designed and produced works of art in many different mediums, some in collaboration with other members of the Wiener Werkstaette like Hoffman. For example, on a glass, Flögl painted the designs on the sides of a cup Hoffman constructed. Similarly, with a glass box, Flögl added the floral designs while Hoffman manufactured the box. Flögl also painted murals for residences and establishments in Vienna including the Graben-Café. She worked in fashion, notably designing the fabric for a gown at the held at the Kyoto Costume Institute, in addition to accessories such as beaded necklaces. She also did many ceramic pieces including a ceramic candelabra (c. 1925) and a ceramic hunting scene featuring dogs attacking a deer (1917). Designs for textiles, glassware, and metalwork seems to be where most of her work lies. Flögl used floral designs in her work in addition to more geometric patterns making pieces that were both abstract and linear. An example of this style is seen in a swatch called Fälter (butterfly), designed for the bedspread of Karl Duldig and Slawa Horowitz-Duldig in 1924. It was block printed onto silk. This use of an artist's work as a bedspread also exemplified the Wiener Werkstätte's belief in art being incorporated into all areas of life. Flögl used abstract shapes and geometric lines, as was characteristic of her work, to produce columns of bright butterflies separated by colourful vertical lines. Flögl was partial to butterflies. In 1929, Swiss- German company, Salubra manufactured a wallpaper collection designed by Flögl. Copper Hewitt has an online collection featuring 59 pieces of her painted design work, most painted in gouache. For the group's 25th anniversary, Flögl edited, arranged, wrote, and published, The Wiener Werkstätte, 1903-1928: The Evolution of the Modern Applied Arts Exhibitions. It was published in English, French, and German. The book includes essays on the group's notable figures, members’ monograms, and illustrations of the members’ work over the 25-year period. The text was received with mixed reviews; Some criticised the text's lack of typographical process and Max Ermers, associated with Adolf Loos (a notable architect of the time), asserted that the text showed the “spirit of the very spirit of the WW, culture of the terminal culture proper to the Decline of the West.” = Exhibitions = While Flögl was a part of the collective, the Wiener Werkstätte was involved with many exhibitions. One of the earlier exhibitions featuring Flögl included the 1917 “Stockholm Austrian Art Exhibition,” where 240 pieces were contributed by the Wiener Werkstätte. The exhibition was designed to display's Austria's creativity during WWI, a creativity that would continue into times of peace too. In 1925, the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et industriels Modernes was held In Paris. This exhibition was designed to display modern forms of aesthetics, anything that reproduced previous styles was rejected from the exhibition. 1930 was the year of the Werkbund exhibition in Paris. The exhibition featured the French decorative style and the more standardized German style.  A Workshop of Her Own  Between 1931-1935 Flögl operated her own workshop, centred around fashion and interior design  The Wiener Frauenkunst  Flögl was reported to have been a part of the Wiener Frauenkunst (literally translated to Viennese Women's Art) which emerged from the “Vereinigung bildender Künstlerinnen Österreichs” (Association of Fine Artists of Austria) (VBKÖ) in 1926. The group proved to be much more radical than the VBKÖ. It aimed to encourage women's artwork, taking attention away from and destabilizing male art organizations, announcing liberation from the patriarchal art world. They investigated gender through a feminist lens. The Wiener Frauenkunst held many exhibitions in Vienna. The group closed in 1956 shortly after the founder, Fanny Harlfinger, died as no new members joined and the old ones seemed inactive.

Education  Betty Ayako Mochizuki studied at the Ontario College of Art and Design in Toronto. Mochizuki graduated in 1954, specializing in landscapes and still-life paintings. Throughout her life, she studied under Canadian Artists Jock Macdonald and Jack Nichols.  Artwork and mentions  Betty Mochizuki is noted for her lively and impressionistic landscape designs, as well as her paintings of flowers and graphic-styled still life works. Mochizuki's work touches on her family's Japanese heritage, and the integration of multiple cultural backgrounds into one's own identity When questioned about her works' stylistically eastern influences, she replied that \\"it just comes out that way.\\" Mochizuki's unnamed pen and ink drawing, which depicts several whales playing within an amulet, is featured in the poetry anthology book Whale Sound. The work reflects Mochizuki's printmaking skill, illustrating her understanding of defined and steady line-work. Mochizuki's oil painting Scented Memory is currently displayed in the Art Gallery of Ontario, which was donated as a gift from Douglas M. Duncan's personal collection after his passing. In the book by Joan Murray, Confessions of a Curator, a painting by Mochizuki is mentioned, though the title is not stated. The work is recalled as a favourite of the MP's receptionist, who refused to let it be taken away. A small biography on Mochizuki is published in the fourth volume of A Dictionary of Canadian Artists.  Exhibitions and reception  Mochizuki held several solo exhibitions with the Picture Loan Society in 1955, 1958, 1960, and 1976. Mochizuki featured her Oil Painting Cycle in the Canadian Group of Painters Exhibition in 1962 and 1963, which showcased her ability to depict abstract content among her collection of landscapes, and indicates a great range of versatility. Mochizuki's work was frequently featured in exhibitions held by the Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour. Mochizuki held several solo shows, one of which was composed solely of her oil paintings, and another that showcased her works in watercolour. In 1976, Mochizuki held another solo show of her paintings and drawings at the Sisler Gallery in Toronto. Mochizuki's watercolours displayed at her solo Watercolour Exhibition in 1960 were noted for their technical excellence, though she was criticized for deriving much inspiration from the works of others. Despite criticism, she was considered an artist to watch, and Colin Sabiston stated that he believed she would rank well in later years. Another critic noted Mochizuki's work as being graceful, yet vivacious, with her landscape and flower paintings being stated as having charm and delicacy. Two of Mochizuki's landscape paintings featured in the Jack Sullivan Sculpture Exhibit in 1965 were \\"especially worth mentioning\\" and were considered a notable attraction amongst the other works. In 1962, Mochizuki was awarded the C.W. Jeffery's Award for Outstanding Graphic Art for her work Most of Mochizuki's work is kept in private collections, however several of her pieces are currently displayed at University of Toronto, Sarnia Public Library and Art Gallery, London Regional Art Gallery, and the Art Gallery of Ontario.

Biography She was born and grew up in Blackheath in south-east London.Robin Oakley, \\"From Blackheath to Broadway: Discovering a Great-Aunt on the Edwardian Musical Stage\\", Journal of the North West Kent Family History Society, Vol.14, No.12, December 2018. https://www.nwkfhs.org.uk/images/journals/vol_14/nwkfhs--14-12.pdf She adopted the stage name Daphne Glenne in response to her father's disapproval of her seeking a career on the stage, and she continued to use this as her name throughout her life. She began her theatrical career as a chorister with the D’Oyly Carte Company at the Savoy Theatre in 1906–1907, at one point taking a minor role in the Gilbert and Sullivan opera Iolanthe. Subsequently, she was engaged by George Edwardes to play in his touring production of Franz Lehár’s The Merry Widow. Initially she played Olga, but quickly took over the title role of Sonia, which she performed around Britain from 1908-1910.Source for this and subsequent performance history is British Newspaper Archive. Returning to London, she took over the role of Lady Augusta in the musical play The Dollar Princess at Daly's Theatre. However, she was soon engaged by the American producer Charles Frohman to play the title role in his touring production of The Dollar Princess which travelled around the US in 1910-1911. Later in 1911, she returned to the United States in the role of Princess Mathilde in Lionel Monckton’s The Quaker Girl, which ran from 1911-1912 in New York at the Park Theatre on Broadway. She continued to play this role in George Edwardes’ touring production in Britain after her return later in 1912. From 1913 onwards, she played leading roles in a series of successful musical comedies and revues, both in London and on tour, including Bric-a-Brac, Tonight's the Night, and The Dancing Mistress. In 1917 she was persuaded by the prominent film producer Will Barker to move into silent films. After the success of her first film On Leave, Barker engaged her for another three years to make further films, billing her as “England’s Own Picture Girl”. Between 1918 and 1920 she made five more films (4 of them for Barker) in which she played lead roles, with directors including Alexander Butler and Bert Haldane. No copies of these films appear to have survived. After 1920 she made no further films, and her career on the stage and in film basically ended. By then Barker had retired and sold his production facilities at Ealing Studios, while her two patrons in musical comedy, George Edwardes and Charles Frohman, had both died in 1915 (Frohman in the sinking of the Lusitania). In 1928 she re-appeared briefly in the musical play Topsy and Eva in Glasgow with the Duncan sisters, under the direction of Jack Buchanan, but she is not listed in the opening cast for the London staging that followed. From the 1930s until the early 1950s she ran a dancing school in Birmingham, putting on revues and pantomimes for charity, especially during the wartime period. After retiring she lived in South London and died in 1972 at a nursing home in Bexhill.

It carried two pilots and five passengers on its maiden flight. The five passengers were the founders of the airline – Soriano, Fernández, Juan Miguel Elizalde, John R. Schultz and Ernesto Von Kaufmann. Government investment in September 1941 paved the way for its nationalization. On October 23, 1941, John R. Schultz was elected by the Board of Directors as Treasurer of Philippine Air Lines. PAL services were interrupted during World War II, which lasted in the Philippines from late 1941 to 1945. Upon the outbreak of the Pacific War on December 8, 1941 the two Model 18s and its pilots were pressed into military service. They were used to evacuate American fighter pilots to Australia until one was shot down over Mindanao and the other was destroyed on the ground in an air raid in Surabaya, Indonesia. On February 15, 1946, PAL resumed operations after a five-year hiatus with service to 15 domestic points with five Douglas DC-3s and a payroll of 108 names. Philippine Airlines returned to its original home, Nielson Field in Makati. The airport, heavily damaged during the war, was refurbished and modernized by PAL at a cost of over one million pesos, quickly becoming the official port of entry for air passengers into the Philippines. The airport was operated by Manila International Air Terminal, Inc., a wholly owned PAL subsidiary. Philippine Airlines Vickers Viscount at Kai Tak Airport in 1961 On July 31, 1946, PAL became the first Asian airline to cross the Pacific Ocean when a chartered Douglas DC-4 ferried 40 American servicemen to Oakland, California from Nielson Airport with stops in Guam, Wake Island, Johnston Atoll and Honolulu. A regular service between Manila and San Francisco started in December 1946. During this time, the airline was designated as the country's flag carrier.Philippine Airlines Info Kit 1982, Philippine Airlines. 1982. PAL commenced service to Europe in 1947 with the acquisition of more Douglas DC-4s. By 1948, PAL had absorbed the only other scheduled airlines in the Philippines, Far Eastern Air Transport and Commercial Air Lines.Flight International April 12–18, 2005 Following the government's decision to convert Nichols Field in Pasay City, the site of a former U.S. Air Force base, into the new international airport for Manila, PAL was required to move its base of operations and passenger terminal there from Nielson Airport. The transfer was accomplished over a five-month period from January 31 to June 28, 1948, with PAL investing an additional P600,000 in ground installations and improvements to Nichols Field. In 1951 PAL leased a DC-3 named \\"Kinsei\\" to Japan Airlines, which led to the founding of the country's own national airline.JAL's \\"Kinsei\\", Japan Airlines. Retrieved April 23, 2008. In March 1954, the Philippine government suspended all flights to Europe, Japan and the United States, only to resume five years later. In three years PAL started services to Hong Kong, Bangkok, and Taipei using Convair 340s that would later be replaced by the Vickers Viscount 784, which brought the airline into the turboprop age.  First expansion and modernization (1960–1989)  A Philippine Airlines DC-10 in Zurich. The airline operated six DC-10s, which consisted of five −30 series and one −30CF series. In the 1960s, PAL entered the jet age, initially with a lone Boeing 707, later replaced with Douglas DC-8 aircraft leased from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, used for long-haul international flights to Europe and the United States. The DC-3 remained the mainstay of domestic services as it expanded to a total of 72 points as airports were improved or opened, but most of the airline's rural air service was later stopped in May 1964. Two years later, PAL commenced its first jet services to Cebu, Bacolod, and Davao using the BAC1-11. In addition, PAL was privatized, as the Philippine government relinquished its share in PAL after Benigno Toda, Jr., then-PAL chairman, acquired a majority stake in the airline. A year after the declaration of martial law in 1972, Ferdinand Marcos, during his second presidential term, issued monopolizing decrees in the form of Letters of Instruction (LOI) nos. 151 and 151-A, which were known as the \\"one-airline policy\\". PAL was the lone surviving airline, absorbing Air Manila and Filipinas Orient Airways. On March 10, 1973, PAL was re-designated as the national flag carrier. PAL continued its expansion with the arrival of its first Douglas DC-10 in July 1974. Three years later, the Philippine government re-nationalized PAL, with the Government Service Insurance System holding a majority of PAL shares. In 1979, the Boeing 727, the Boeing 747-200B and the Airbus A300B4, dubbed the \\"Love Bus\\", joined the PAL fleet, while the PAL DC-8 fleet was retired. In 1975, Philippine Airlines was headquartered at the PAL Building in Makati City.\\"World Airline Directory.\\" Flight International. March 20, 1975. 497.\\" Retrieved on June 17, 2009. Between 1979 and 1981, as part of a comprehensive modernization program led by then-PAL President Roman A. Cruz, PAL built a series of mammoth aviation-related facilities around the periphery of the MIA. These included the PAL Technical Center, the PAL Inflight Center, the PAL Data Center and the PAL Aviation School. In the same time period, PAL also achieved service successes, after being the first airline to be honored by Les Chaines de Rotisseurs, an ancient order of gourmets, with an award for its inflight cuisine. On January 4, 1980, The Philippine Airlines' Boeing 747-200 dubbed the \\"Jumbo Jet\\" was the first of its kind to fly across the pacific. In addition to that, PAL was also the first airline to introduce numerous fully flat bed seats in one aircraft. The 14 sleeping berths in the 747 known as \\"Skybeds\\" was certified for landing and take off. The \\"Skybeds\\" were exclusive to first class in the upper deck. A Philippine Airlines Boeing 747-200 at Rome in March 1989 On April 2, 1982, a PAL Boeing 747-200B arriving from San Francisco via Honolulu became the first aircraft to dock at the new 800-million peso Terminal 1 of Manila International Airport. PAL would later strengthen its cargo-handling capability by building a dedicated cargo terminal building adjacent to the MIA passenger terminal and installing cargo-refrigeration equipment in 1983. The new facilities, which catered mainly to international cargo services, enabled PAL to become a fully equipped cargo handler. Services to Paris and Zürich began in November 1982. After Cruz's resignation to President Cory Aquino on the last day of the 1986 EDSA Revolution, Dante G. Santos became PAL president. He launched a massive modernization of the domestic fleet with the acquisition of the Short 360, nicknamed the \\"Sunriser\\", in May 1987, the Fokker 50 in August 1988 and the Boeing 737-300 jet in August 1989. Corazon Aquino also abolished Marcos's one-airline policy in 1988. As the Manila domestic passenger terminal outgrew its capacity and ramp aircraft parking space became more scarce, PAL leased the hangar of the Philippine Aerospace Development Corporation and converted it into the PAL Domestic Terminal 2. The terminal, which opened in October 1988, exclusively served passengers flying to destinations serviced by PAL's Airbus A300s: namely, Cebu and Davao, with General Santos and Puerto Princesa added later on. At the same time, PAL also expanded and improved the existing terminal. The opening of the new facility cleared out the old terminal and provided greater convenience to passengers.  Re-privatization and second expansion (1990–1997)  A Philippine Airlines A320 at Taoyuan International Airport. The A320 is one of PAL's first narrow body aircraft. PAL was privatized again in January 1992, when the government sold a 67% share of PAL to a holding company called PR Holdings. However, a conflict as to who would lead PAL led to a compromise in 1993, when former Agriculture Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez was elected as the PAL president by the airline's board of directors. The fleet of BAC1-11s were retired in May 1992, following the completion of the deliveries of Boeing 737s, and the Short 360s in September. In November 1993, PAL acquired its first Boeing 747-400. The new aircraft arrived at Subic Bay International Airport and was carrying then-President Fidel V. Ramos, who was headed home from the United States after an official visit. The 400-ton aircraft, one of the world's largest and most popular long-range aircraft was a mainstay of PAL's trans-Pacific services and its flagship aircraft until it was retired in 2014. A new service between Manila and Osaka, launched in 1994, brought to 34 the number of points in PAL's international route network. The PAL Domestic Terminal 2 was refurbished in 1995, with a number of facilities being added or improved, including a renovated Mabuhay Lounge, an exclusive check-in counter for Mabuhay Class passengers, an Express Counter, refreshment bar, a medical clinic, an expansive waiting lounge and two baggage carousels in the arrival section. PAL facilities at NAIA were also renovated. The total cost for the renovation of the domestic terminal (1 and 2) reached P33.15 million. In January 1995, Lucio C. Tan, the majority shareholder of PR Holdings, became the new chairman and CEO of the airline. The delivery of the carrier's fourth Boeing 747-400 in April 1996 signaled the start of an ambitious US$4 billion modernization and re-fleeting program that aimed to make PAL one of Asia's best airlines within three years. The centerpiece of the program was the acquisition of 36 state-of-the-art aircraft from Airbus and Boeing between 1996 and 1999. The re-fleeting sought to give PAL the distinction of having the youngest fleet in Asia and allow the expansion of its domestic and international route network. The 36 orders of PAL during its re-fleeting program were for eight Boeing 747-400's, four Airbus A340-300's, two Airbus A340-200s, eight Airbus A330-300's and twelve Airbus A320-200's. The re- fleeting program enabled PAL to be dubbed the first airline in the world to operate the full range of new-generation Airbus aircraft.PAL acquires 18 Airbus jets in major re-fleeting move, PhilippineAirlines.com. Retrieved January 2007.  Asian financial crisis (1997–1999)  A Philippine Airlines Airbus A340-200 at Charles de Gaulle International Airport in January 1998 In 1997, PAL rebranded itself as \\"Asia's sunniest airline\\" to cap its new marketing and advertising thrust. PAL also commenced services to New York City, using the Newark Liberty International Airport via Vancouver. The acquisition of too many aircraft matched with unprofitable routes forced the airline to be financially unstable. The re-fleeting program was about halfway through when the full impact of the 1997 Asian financial crisis struck the airline industry early in 1998. By March 31, 1999, PAL dismantled its Mactan- Cebu International Airport hub. With massive lay-offs also taking place, disputes between the airline's owners and the employee's union led to a complete shutdown of PAL's operations on September 23, 1998.Business Travel; Philippine Airlines may shut down operations tonight, a victim of the Asian economic crisis. The New York Times (September 23, 1998). Retrieved on 2016-10-20. Cathay Pacific temporarily took over PAL's domestic and international operations during its fourteen-day shutdown, with Cathay Pacific also showing interest in acquiring a 40-percent stake in PAL during this period. However, no agreement was reached with the Hong Kong-based airline. PAL resumed operations on October 7, 1998 after an agreement between PAL employees and top management, reported to be facilitated by Philippine President Joseph Estrada, was reached, with services to 15 domestic points out of Manila. On October 29, the flag carrier resumed international services with flights to Los Angeles and San Francisco, with other international services being restored three weeks later. Asian services resumed on November 11 with flights to Tokyo and Hong Kong. PAL gradually expanded its network over the next two months, restoring services to Taipei, Osaka (via Cebu), Singapore, Fukuoka, Dhahran, Riyadh and Seoul. With the aviation industry still in the doldrums, PAL continued to search for a strategic partner, but in the end, it submitted a \\"standalone\\" rehabilitation plan to the SEC on December 7, 1998. The plan provides a sound basis for the airline to undertake a recovery on its own while keeping the door open to the entry of a strategic partner in the future. PAL presented the new proposed rehabilitation plan to its major creditors during a two-week marathon meeting that started on February 14 in Washington D.C. and ended on March 1 in Hong Kong. In 1999, PAL submitted its amended rehabilitation plan to the Securities and Exchange Commission that comprised a revised business plan and a revised financial restructuring plan. The plan also required the infusion of US$200 million in new equity, with 40% to 60% coming from financial investors and translating to no less than 90% ownership of PAL. That same year, with the unprecedented boom in air travel, PAL operations were moved to the then-new Terminal 2 of Ninoy Aquino International Airport. The terminal, named as the Centennial Terminal in commemoration of 100 years of Philippine independence, is located at the site of the original MIA terminal building from 1961 to 1972. On August 9, 1999, PAL moved selected domestic flights to the P5.3 billion terminal. Full domestic operations operated from the new terminal on August 10, while international services followed soon after, thus consolidating PAL's flight operations in one terminal for the first time.  Receivership and rehabilitation (2000–2008)  In 2000, PAL finally returned to profitability, making some ₱44.2 million in its first year of rehabilitation, breaking some six years of heavy losses. On September 1, 2000, PAL formally handed over its ownership of its maintenance and engineering division to German-led joint venture Lufthansa Technik Philippines (LTP), the world's largest provider of aircraft maintenance services in accordance with the provisions of its rehabilitation plan, which mandates the disposal of the airline's non-core assets. In August of the same year, PAL opened an e-mail booking facility. In 2001, PAL continued to gain a net profit of P419 million in its second year of rehabilitation. In that year alone, PAL restored services to Bangkok, Taipei, Sydney, Busan, Jakarta, Vancouver and Ho Chi Minh City, while launching new services to Shanghai and Melbourne. A year later, PAL restored services to Guam and Tagbilaran. Like other airlines, PAL was severely affected by the September 11 attacks in 2001. In 2003, PAL was restructured again. A Philippine Airlines Airbus A330-300 in 2005 The Mabuhay Miles frequent flyer program was launched in 2002, combining PAL's former frequent flyer programs, PALSmiles, Mabuhay Club, and the Flying Sportsman (now SportsPlus) all into one. The PAL RHUSH (Rapid Handling of Urgent Shipments) Cargo service was also re-launched during the same year. An online arrival and departure facility and a new booking system was then launched in 2003. In December, PAL also acquired a fifth Boeing 747-400. In 2004, PAL launched services to Las Vegas to mark its 63rd year of service. PAL also returned to Laoag and started services to Macau on codeshare with Air Macau. In that same year, the PAL entered into code share agreements with Air France and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines for services to Paris and Amsterdam, respectively.PAL gains Europe access with KLM code-share deal, Philippine Airlines Press Release, April 4, 2003 Code share service to Paris was cut due to the merging of the two European airlines and the formation of Air France-KLM.

PAL also continued an overhaul of its fleet with the arrival of two new Airbus A320-214s and continued modernizing its ticketing systems with the launch of electronic ticketing. For the first time in Philippine history, the airline flew President-elect Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Vice-President-elect, now ABS-CBN journalist Noli de Castro to their inauguration in Cebu City.

The first brand-new, GECAS-leased Airbus A319-112s were delivered to and inaugurated by PAL and President Arroyo on October 20, 2006. It was the first aircraft in the airline's history to offer AVOD-capable inflight entertainment on its Mabuhay Class cabin. In December, the airline initiated its wide-body re-fleeting program by signing a deal with Boeing for the purchase of two Boeing 777-300ER aircraft to be delivered in 2009, with an option for two more planes in 2011. PAL also signed a separate agreement with GECAS to lease another two Boeing 777-300ER aircraft for delivery in 2010.

PAL continued its ambitious expansion plans, launching regional subsidiary PAL Express on April 10, 2008 to supersede the financially troubled Air Philippines, with a $150 million order for three 50-seat Bombardier Q300 and six 78-seat Bombardier Q400 aircraft from Bombardier Aerospace. PAL Express operations began on 5 May with eight flights daily between Manila and Malay, while hub operations from Cebu City commenced on 19 May with flights between Cebu and five points in the Visayas and Mindanao.PAL Express unveiled, Philippine Airlines Press Release, April 14, 2008 Services to other destinations, including many destinations formerly served by PAL prior to the Asian financial crisis, began in June and July 2008.PAL Express to fly 22 routes initially, Philippine Airlines Press Release, May 5, 2008 PAL Express was originally to be primarily based in Cebu and fly intra-regional routes in the Visayas and Mindanao, as well as secondary routes to smaller airports in island provinces. In response to rising competition from Cebu Pacific and Zest Airways, PAL Express rebranded itself as Airphil Express on March 28, 2010 under a low-cost model. PAL decided to restore the PAL Express name as part of expansion strategy, effectively rendering the Airphil Express brand defunct on March 15, 2013. Despite PAL's successful exit from receivership, international safety concerns regarding the Philippine aviation industry severely hindered its expansion plans. The United States Federal Aviation Administration downgraded the Philippines' aviation industry from Category 1 to Category 2 in January 2008, preventing PAL from increasing its flights to the United States from 33 per week or from switching the type of aircraft used unless the airline undertakes a wet-lease agreement with a different carrier. The FAA decision effectively stalled PAL's previously announced intentions to expand its presence in the US market with routes to San Diego, Seattle, Chicago, Saipan and New York City. On March 30, 2010, Philippines-based carriers were placed in an EU aviation blacklist (no longer true as of 2019), banning PAL from flying to any European destinations. Since 2013, PAL is no longer in the blacklist. Nonetheless, PAL continued its route expansion plans in the Asia- Pacific region, resuming services to Riyadh with a four times weekly Boeing 747 service four years after it was suspended, as well as adding a twice weekly Airbus A330 service to Brisbane and three-times-weekly service to Delhi via Bangkok. However, the expansion proved unprofitable and all three routes were cancelled. Flights to Brisbane and Riyadh were suspended in 2011, and the Manila-Bangkok-Delhi route ended in 2013; however service to Brisbane and Riyadh resumed in the same year. Despite these hindrances on its expansion, PAL went ahead with its widebody re-fleeting program, receiving its first two Boeing 777-300ER aircraft on November 19, 2009 and January 2010 respectively, and another two leased from GECAS in 2010. Due to the inability for PAL to further expand its long-haul network, the airline launched 777 service to its existing long-haul routes including Tokyo, Los Angeles and Vancouver. The 777-300ER jet features 370 seats in a two-class configuration (42 flat business class seats in a 2-3-2 layout and 328 economy class seats in a 3-4-3 layout), and is also PAL's first aircraft to feature AVOD in-flight entertainment in all classes (later retrofitted in its 747-400 fleet). = Labor disputes = In July 2010, 25 of Philippine Airlines' pilots resigned and left to seek employment abroad without informing the airline. After calls to return to work by both the airline and Philippine Government, PAL subsequently sought to file charges against the pilots involved for breach of contract. In the same month, PAL announced that it would be outsourcing jobs, with retrenchments resulting. Disputes with flight attendants, ground crew, airport staff as well as reservation agents escalated, with threats of potentially disruptive strike action, which took place in October. On Friday, November 12, 2010, the Department of Labor and Employment approved the lay-off of 2600 employees of Philippine Airlines.Labor Department Approves Philippine Airlines Layoff Of 2,600 EmployeesAHN  Entry of San Miguel Corporation (2012–2014)  On April 4, 2012, San Miguel Corporation bought a 49-percent stake in Philippine Airlines for $500 million as part of a strategy to move away from its beer and food businesses. San Miguel, one of the Philippines' biggest conglomerates, said it planned to help modernise and strengthen PAL, renew its aging fleet and restore its competitiveness in the Asian aviation industry. San Miguel president Ramon Ang also announced intentions to join a global airline alliance. PAL's first major initiative under San Miguel ownership was confirmed on August 28, 2012, with a $7 billion order for 54 Airbus aircraft, comprising 44 Airbus A321 (34 with sharklets and 10 A321neo) and 10 Airbus A330-300, with options for 10 more. The A321 was ordered to enhance domestic and regional routes, while the A330-300s are to be flown on Australian, Middle Eastern and some European routes. PAL's original fleet of 8 A330s were transferred to PAL Express in response to Cebu Pacific announcing intentions to compete with PAL on mid-to-long-haul routes. PAL exercised its option to purchase a further 10 A330-300 for $2.5 billion on September 28. PAL took delivery of its first aircraft under this order in 2013. A Philippine Airlines Boeing 777-300ER at Singapore Changi International Airport in 2012 Under San Miguel's management, PAL embarked on expanding its route network, involving both adding new and restoring previously terminated routes. In 2013, the airline announced its return to Abu Dhabi, Dammam and Riyadh, and launched new routes to Brisbane and Perth (via Darwin), as well as Doha and Jeddah. In 2013, PAL was removed from the EU aviation blacklist after three years of negotiations, and the carrier immediately announced its European plans. PAL subsequently launched flights between Manila and Heathrow to commence in November 2013, its first European destination in 15 years. The airline will expand its US service as they will open flights from Manila to New York via Vancouver. In addition to its fleet modernization and route expansion, PAL announced plans to become an investor within the aviation industry following the San Miguel partial acquisition. In 2012, the airline entered into negotiations with Cayman Airways for a 50 percent equity share in the Caribbean-based airline. Under the deal, Cayman Airways will issue new preferred shares to PAL's majority shareholder, San Miguel Corporation. As part of the proposed scheme, Cayman Airways will use the fresh capital to acquire new aircraft which will then be leased out to Philippine Airlines under a wet lease agreement. The planes will be registered and domiciled in the Cayman Islands, and to be flown, operated and maintained completely by Cayman Airways. In 2013, PAL entered a joint venture with the Cambodian conglomerate Royal Group of Cambodia, headed by Kith Meng to launch a new incarnation Cambodia Airlines with a 49% share. The new airline was originally expected to commence operations by June 2013, however no services have been launched as of September. On August 30, 2012, PAL president Ramon Ang announced its intention to build a second international airport to service Metro Manila. Citing the need to relieve pressure on the congested and outdated Ninoy Aquino International Airport and the unreasonable 90 km distance from the Philippine government's favoured second airport option at Clark, Ang announced that the airline was in negotiations with a Korean contractor to build the airport on a 2000-hectare site, initially with two runways, eventually expanding to four, in a yet-undisclosed location north of Metro Manila. In March 2013, PAL postponed the project indefinitely citing government restrictions on airline corporate ownership of Philippine airports. However, on July 12, 2013, Ang stated that PAL was 'still looking to build' a new airport and were '100% sure' that the project would eventuate, although plans had yet to be finalised. In a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange on September 8, 2014, San Miguel stated that it has signed an agreement \\"whereby [San Miguel] expressed willingness to sell its 49% stake to the group of Dr. Lucio Tan, and the latter has expressed willingness to buy the said 49% stake.\\" It added the deal is \\"subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions.\\" Informed sources said San Miguel gave Tan a week to raise $1 billion to acquire the stake. The final transaction amounted to $1.3 billion and was completed a week later on September 15, 2014. In a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange on September 16, 2014, San Miguel said Tan assumed day-to-day management of PAL through the appointment of its former president, Jaime Bautista, as general manager. However, it maintained that Ang, as president of PAL, remains, along with the rest of his team, \\"until the relevant closing date of the agreement\\" between the parties. On October 15, 2014, Ang officially stepped down as president and COO.

Under Bautista's rule, Philippine Airlines deferred the deliveries of the Airbus A321neo that was supposed to be delivered from November 2017, under the San Miguel management. The strategic move minimised the risk of an overcapacity with single aisle aircraft in the PAL fleet. Jaime Bautista also announced plans to replace its A340 fleet, with the choice of a new and modern Airbus A350 XWB or Boeing 787 Dreamliner. In addition to new aircraft, PAL has chosen to lease more 777s for its growing long haul flights. In January 2015, Philippine Airlines became the official carrier of Pope Francis throughout his apostolic trip in the Philippines. The aircraft boarded by the pontiff was named \\"Shepherd One\\". The airline flew the pope to the city of Tacloban and, as per traditional protocol, flew him back to Ciampino Airport in Rome, Italy from Manila. A Philippine Airlines A320 with the '75' livery In March 2015, coinciding with the 74th anniversary of the carrier, Philippine Airlines resumed flights to New York City via the John F. Kennedy International Airport with a stopover in Vancouver from Manila. The airline previously flew to New York via Newark Liberty International Airport, but canceled the route in 1997 following the Asian financial crisis. Philippine Airlines originally utilized the Airbus A340 for its flights, but in October 2015, PAL upgraded its Boeing 747-400 order to the larger Boeing 777-300ER to increase seat capacity for flights to New York. In addition, Philippine Airlines expanded to the Oceania region by introducing flights to Auckland, New Zealand (via Cairns, Australia) and Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea. Philippine Airlines' global expansion and new routes also made the airline among nine out of the sixteen publicly traded Southeast Asian carriers to be profitable, having kept a $120 million profit. It was ranked the fourth profitable overall and second profitable full-service carrier in Southeast Asia, according to the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation. In June 2015, Philippine Airlines renewed its partnership with Lufthansa Technik Philippines for a two-year base and heavy maintenance checks for its Airbus fleet. In 2016, Philippine Airlines announced the launching of flights between Manila and Doha, Manila and Kuwait City (via Dubai), and Cebu City to Los Angeles. In April 2016, on Philippine Airlines' 75th anniversary, the airline introduced a new campaign called The Heart of the Filipino. The campaign was aggressively undertaken, with the launch of new advertisements which are endorsed by The Voice of the Philippines judges: singers Bamboo Mañalac, Lea Salonga, and Sarah Geronimo, as well as the Miss Universe 2015 winner, Pia Wurtzbach. The airline adopted a new theme song, which incorporates the vocals of Mañalac, Salonga, and Geronimo. The lyrics famously includes the old PAL slogan \\"Shining Through,\\" reminiscing on PAL's successful campaign in the 1980s. The airline also released a new pre-flight safety demonstration video in conjunction with The Heart of the Filipino campaign, called Heart of The Nation, in February 2017. The video featured various tourist destinations in the Philippines with locals from those destinations demonstrating the safety guidelines. Philippine Airlines continued its expansion by augmenting its international and domestic flights. The airline started flying to Nanning and Sapporo, and non-stop flights to Brisbane, New York City, Perth, Toronto. There are also plans to introduce new flights to New Delhi and Mumbai. The airline also launched new flights to Clark, making Clark International Airport its second hub after Mactan–Cebu International Airport. However, the airline indefinitely suspended flights to Kuwait, Jeddah, and Darwin, as well as the route from Cebu City to Los Angeles, citing low demand. Continuing with its fleet expansion, Philippine Airlines acquired new aircraft to serve its new routes. The airline received its 9th and 10th Boeing 777-300ER in 2017. The airline also acquired six new Airbus A350-900 with options for six more. The first A350 was delivered on July 14, 2018, with the other A350s being delivered subsequently. Both aircraft were used for international, long-haul flights. The airline also acquired the Airbus A321neo (with a standard and long-range variant) and Bombardier Q400, the former used for regional flights and the latter used for domestic flights. The airline also announced its intention to acquire the Airbus A350-1000, the largest variant of Airbus A350. The airline retired its Airbus A340 aircraft, the airline being the last to use the aircraft in Asia, and some of its Airbus A320ceo, with some transferred to its subsidiary, PAL express. With improvements to its existing fleet, facilities, and services, along with its continued fleet modernization and expansion, the airline was certified with a four-star rating from Skytrax, joining 40 other airlines, after an audit made in December 2017. PAL was also awarded a 4-star certification by APEX on September 26, 2018, and was considered the Most Improved Airline of 2019 by AirlineRatings.com. The airline signed agreements with companies such as Amadeus to upgrade its core technology system, and Lufthansa Technik Philippines to maintain its aircraft for 12 years. PAL also signed an agreement with the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) on September 28, 2018 to give travel privileges to all AFP military personnel in the form of discounted domestic economy or business class tickets. On January 29, 2019, All Nippon Airways purchased a 9.5% stake on the airline's holding company, PAL Holdings, for US$95 million. On February 20, 2019, Philippine Airlines took delivery of its fifth Airbus A350, with the iconic \\"Love Bus\\" symbol, commemorating its forty years of partnership with aircraft manufacturer, Airbus. On June 18, 2019, Philippine Airlines announced the appointment of Lucio Tan's daughter, Vivienne as the new executive vice president and OIC following the retirement of president and COO Jaime Bautista.  Entry of Gilbert Santa Maria and the COVID–19 pandemic (2019–present)  On July 29, 2019, Philippine Airlines appointed Gilbert Santa Maria as the new president and COO, replacing Jaime Bautista. Viviene Tan was reassigned as the head of audit. In February 2020, Philippine Airlines decided to lay off 300 of its workers due to financial losses caused by the pandemic. On March 15, 2020, it was announced that all domestic flights in and out of Manila would be suspended by the Philippine Government due to the rising case of coronavirus in the Philippines. On March 17, 2020, it was announced that all domestic flights in the Philippines would be suspended. 26 March: PAL stopped all international flights. 7 April: * PAL arranged for two flights to take UK residents back to the UK on Boeing 777-300ER. * Given the extension of the Luzon quarantine, PAL announced that it would continue to not fly any planes until 30 April and therefore would aim to start up flights again on 1 May. 14 April: PAL arranged two flights to bring back those passengers who were eligible given entry restrictions: one from Vancouver, and the other from Toronto.

The title encompassed Count of the Holy Roman Empire, Comte de Morhange, and Graf von Port Eliot. History In 1735 Granville Elliott was set to marry Jeanne Thérèse du Han, Comtesse de Martigny and lady of honour to the Empress of Germany. Prior to their wedding Emperor Charles VI created him Comte de Morhange and he was made a Chamberlain to the Emperor.Marshall, John, Royal Naval Biography, Volume 3, Part 2, Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown, London, 1832 Over time he eventually became a Count of the Holy Roman Empire.Porter, William S., Genealogy of the Eliot family, George B. Bassett & Co., New Haven, 1854 Granville spent a significant amount of time attempting to prove that Richard Eliot and Catherine Killigrew had married prior to the birth of their son George Elliott. If this where true it would make Granville the rightful heir to Sir John Eliot and thus Port Eliot, the ancestral home of the Eliot Family and seat of the Earl of St Germans. Despite his attempt failing Granville was given the title Graf von Port Eliot. Upon his death in 1759 the titles where passed to his oldest living son Amable Gaspard Antoine Elliott. In 1808, after the fall of the Holy Roman Empire, the title Count of the Empire was transferred to the German Empire. Without an heir, Amable Gaspard Antoine Elliott chose his half brother Francis Perceval Eliot to succeed him. Francis thought being in French and German nobility would be improper and died in 1818 without assuming the titles.

Initially influenced by the minimalist Bauhaus style, she soon developed her own distinctive Structuralist approach to weaving, becoming one of Denmark's most important contributors to tapestry. In 1935, she joined the Danish School of Arts and Crafts (Kunsthåndværkerskole) where she remained for over 40 years, teaching painting and composition, increasingly with an emphasis on textile art. Biography Born on 20 March 1907 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, Franziska Paula Konstante Duden was the daughter of the German business executive Paul Duden (1868–1954) and his wife Johanne Bertha Nebe (died 1935). The youngest of five children, she was brought up in a well-to-do family; her father, a member of the executive board of the chemical firm Hoechst, was an amateur painter, while her mother came from a family of academics. Her grandfather Konrad Duden was a linguist and founder of the well-known German language dictionary bearing his name. After attending courses in painting, Franka Duden studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule (School of Arts and Crafts) in Frankfurt (1928–29), where she met her future husband, the painter Peter Christian Rasmussen (1897–1935). They married in 1930. After Paul Rasmussen had accepted a position at the newly established Kunsthåndværkerskole (Arts and Crafts School) in Copenhagen, the couple moved to Denmark. While her husband was teaching, Franka created paintings and textiles in her studio. Initially she adopted the simplistic Bauhaus idiom but soon began to develop her own artistic style. After her husband's premature death in 1935, Rasmussen began to teach herself, obtaining a permanent position at the Arts and Crafts School in 1940. She turned out to be an excellent pedagogue, constantly encouraging her students to develop their own artistic styles. Assisted by her colleague Gunilla Lagerbjelke, Rasmussen's work became increasingly based on textiles. Her earlier tapestries and woven creations were inspired by nature but they evolved towards experimental, structuralistically formatted designs, often made of coarse yarns. She held solo exhibitions from 1954 and was one of the few Danes to be represented at the Textile Biennale in Lausanne in 1967. Franka Rasmussen died in Copenhagen on 14 December 1994. Awards In addition to a number of grants and scholarships, Rasmussen received the Eckersberg Medal in 1982.

It was written by Angela Kang and Matthew Negrete, and directed by Jeffrey F. January. It also features the final appearance of Tobin (Jason Douglas). Plot Having taken over leadership of the Saviors following Negan's disappearance, Simon (Steven Ogg) leads the Saviors' convoy to the Hilltop, now intent on wiping out any survivors rather than trying to coerce them into submission as Negan wanted. The convoy's traverse is noticed by Hilltop scouts and the community begins preparing for the imminent attack. When the Savior convoy reaches the community at night, Maggie (Lauren Cohan) contacts Simon over walkie-talkie, warning him that she will personally execute all of the Savior prisoners that they still hold captive, should he mobilize an attack. Simon says the prisoners are no longer members of the Saviors since they were captured, much to the prisoners dismay. As they exchange words, Daryl (Norman Reedus) suddenly arrives, riding up on his motorcycle, and starts opening fire at the Saviors with a machine gun, forcing them to start their attack on the Hilltop; the battle begins in earnest. Prepared for the attack, the Hilltop soldiers attack the Saviors from highly defensible positions, taking out several of their numbers. In the midst of the chaos, Simon takes Dwight (Austin Amelio) to work their way behind the attackers. Inside the community, Simon spots Tara (Alanna Masterson) and begins to hunt her down. However, Dwight, who has secretly sided against the Saviors, shoots Tara in the shoulder with an untainted arrow, saving her from being killed by Simon. Meanwhile, Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and his other forces charge in from the outside, chasing out the remaining Saviors. The next day, the Hilltop community bury their dead and tend to their wounded, unaware that the Saviors had coated their weapons in walker viscera for the attack. Among those injured is Tobin (Jason Douglas), Carol's (Melissa McBride) former boyfriend from Alexandria. Elsewhere, Rick reveals to Maggie (Lauren Cohan) that he had attempted to kill Negan just before the attack but failed and feels some responsibility for how this attack went. Daryl accuses Tara of trusting Dwight after having seen him as part of Simon's forces and escaping with the other Saviors, but Tara insists Dwight is still loyal to them. Morgan (Lennie James) starts having visions of Gavin (Jayson Warner Smith), a dead Savior lieutenant he was intent on killing but could not, who was then unexpectedly killed by Henry (Macsen Lintz). That night, those infected by walker blood, including Tobin, succumb to the infection and turn into walkers, attacking the sleeping residents of the Hilltop. The remaining residents react quickly to put down the walkers, with Carol herself stabbing the reanimated Tobin in the head. Concurrently, Henry accosts the Savior prisoners with a gun, demanding to know which one of them killed his older brother, Benjamin. When none of them respond, Henry unlocks the pen and enters to threaten them directly. However, one of the prisoners, who had also been hit by walker- coated weapons, reanimates and starts attacking them. In the confusion, another Savior, Jared (Joshua Mikel), wrestles the gun from Henry and leads the other Saviors, as well as Gregory (Xander Berkeley), to escape from the Hilltop during the turmoil. When dawn breaks, Maggie oversees more burials of their friends. They discover the missing Savior prisoners, though a few, led by Alden (Callan McAuliffe), offer to stay and help the Hilltop even though they know they will still be treated as prisoners. Additionally, Carol and Morgan go to search for Henry, who appears to have disappeared.

Based on an award-winning novel of the same name by Ramapada Chowdhury, Ekhoni was one of the earliest films to address the problems of urban youth, and to replace the individual hero by a collective protagonist. At the 19th National Film Awards, it won the National Award for Best Screenplay. It also won two BFJA Awards.  Synopsis  The film follows a group of young, college-going men and women. They spend much of their time hanging out at a downbeat tea shop. There are romantic involvements and clashes with their parents and other family members. Most of all, these young people feel a sense of uncertainty about the future. Urmi (Aparna Sen) is from an affluent family and has a fiancé who is an engineer. All the others are from middle-class families. Arun (Swaroop Dutta) resents being made to run small errands for his parents. Halfway through the film, the graduation ceremony of the class takes place. As they listen to the platitudes being dished out from the stage, it is brought home to them that their carefree student days are over. Sujit (Mrinal Mukherjee) is in a relationship with Runu (Moushumi Chatterjee). However, they can't think of marriage until he has a job. He goes for a job interview which turns into a nightmare. Urmi invites the whole group to her place for high tea, and introduces them to her fiancé (Subhendu Chatterjee in a special appearance). Her friends are impressed by the big house and the refined lifestyle. However, the evening only reinforces their feeling of uncertainty about the future. Soon after the tea-party, it is discovered that Arun's mother has brain cancer. Meanwhile, Biman's girl friend Nandini runs away from home, and declares that she won't go back. The whole group pools in efforts to get the couple married and find them a temporary place to live in. Tiklu, who appears to be unromantic, even cynical, diverts money from his family's printing business to help the couple, and is mercilessly beaten up. Arun and Urmi have a long conversation about life and love. Sujit stuns the group by announcing that he has landed a job. They have a celebration party at Biman and Nandini's place. Soon after, Arun's mother dies. A few days later, Arun gets a phone call from Urmi, asking him to meet her urgently. She informs him that she is pregnant, and that her fiancé has abandoned her and gone off to England. She asks him for help to \\"get rid of it\\". Arun thinks long into the night, and tells her that their friends will pick her up next morning in a taxi. When Urmi gets off the cab, she is surprised to find that they are not in an abortion clinic, but an office building. Arun tells her that they have an appointment with the registrar of marriages. Urmi protests that she has no intention of burdening him with another man's child. Arun confesses that he has always been in love with her. They get married and prepare to face an uncertain future together.  Cast  The film has an ensemble cast: * Aparna Sen as Urmi * Moushumi Chatterjee as Runu * Juin Banerjee * Swarup Dutta as Arun * Mrinal Mukherjee as Sujit * Chinmoy Roy as The Intellectual * N. Viswanathan * Rudraprasad Sengupta * Gita Dey * Anubha Gupta * Subhendu Chatterjee - special appearance as Urmi's fiancé * Nirmal Kumar - special appearance  Crew  * Direction - Tapan Sinha * Screenplay - Tapan Sinha (adapted from a novel by Ramapada Chowdhury) * Cinematography - Bimal Mukherjee * Editing - Subodh Roy  Reception  After Apanjan, Ekhoni was the second film by Tapan Sinha to deal with urban issues. According to one reviewer, it \\"created a stir in the society\\". In any case, it was popular at the time, since young urban viewers could identify with the protagonists. As in the earlier film, the unexpected use of Rabindrasangeet in the film added to its attraction. The film also enjoyed critical success, winning a National Award and two BFJA Awards. Aparna Sen lists Ekhoni as one of the films she cherishes having acted in. Scholar Moinak Biswas writes: \\" The emergence of a collective protagonist - the unemployed, angry youth, roaming the urban landscape, temporarily displacing and probably permanently changing the nature of the individual male hero and the romantic couple, signaled a major shift in the practice of cinema across the art-popular divide.\\" He adds: \\"The character galleries that Sinha creates in Apanjan, and in some ways more poignantly in Ekhoni and Raja, are memorable archives of the times.\\"  Preservation  The negative of the film is not available in complete form. According to Anindya Sinha, Tapan Sinha's son, the version that is available has only 40 minutes of the movie. However, there is a version uploaded on YouTube, which, although not of good quality, appears to have close to the full running length. It is not clear whether the company under whose imprint it is uploaded has acquired the rights to this digital version.

Another round of reclassification was made in April 2016, which re-designated the patrol gunboat as the coastal patrol craft \\"PC-385\\".  History  In 1989, the Philippines placed an order of 4 fast patrol craft with Trinity-Equitable (formerly Halter-Marine Equitable) for USD 9.4 million. The first of the four vessels, arrived on August 20, 1990, was named . The lead ship of the class was named after Jose Andrada, who was one of the original officers of the Offshore Patrol of the Philippine Commonwealth government. In April 1990, the Philippines ordered an additional ship and 3 more ships in August 1990. In March 1993, eleven more vessels were ordered. A total of 22 ships were acquired by the Philippine Navy by 1999.  Ship Design  Her class was built to U.S. Coast Guard standards, with an aluminium hull and superstructure. In addition, a 4-meter rigid inflatable boat powered by a 40-hp outboard motor is stowed amidships. She has a complement of 12. The ship is equipped with a Raytheon AN/SPS-64(V)11 Navigation/Surface Search Radar, but with a smaller antenna as those used in bigger Philippine Navy ships.

He was a Republican who represented Warren County, Georgia. He supported civil rights for African Americans and reported racially motivated violence by the Ku Klux Klan. He was murdered in May 1869, after having led a delegation to Washington, D.C. to obtain military protection against widespread acts of violence by the Klan. Background The Ku Klux Klan became violent in Georgia on or before March 30, 1868, when 30 members of the Klan killed white politician George Ashburn after he spoke at a public rally that day. The Klan spread across Georgia and by the fall 260 cases were filed of violence inflicted on blacks, but the court cases were denied by black people against whites. There were also instances where the Klan attacked Georgian Republicans, regardless of the color of their skin. In October 1868, there was a report of 32 assassinations and 212 assaults to the Committee on Murder and Outrages at a convention held in Macon, Georgia. Critics of Adkins considered him a scalawag, someone disloyal to the Confederacy. He supported civil rights for blacks. He also supported posted a statutory bond for someone hated by the Klan and conservatives, Sheriff John Norris in April 1868. He also reported racist crimes and the name of a suspect, Ellis Adams, who was a member of the Klan. Violence continued into 1869, and he led a delegation to Washington, D.C. to request military support in Georgia for safety of its citizens. Murder Although he was warned that White supremacists were targeting him and that he was in danger, Adkins travelled from Washington, D.C. to his home to see his family and attend to personal affairs. Adkins was assassinated by members of the Ku Klux Klan on his way home from the train station at Dearing, Georgia on May 10, 1869. Before he died, he was able to name one of the gang who shot him, Ellis Adams. His wife, Sallie Adkins (identified as Sarah Adkins in some official documents), submitted a petition to the United States Congress about the events. Benjamin Ayer, another white Republican state legislator, was also murdered in May 1869 by the Klan. Aftermath There were unsubstantiated rumors questioning Adkins' honor and fidelity. Adams died in December 1869, not having been charged for the murder of Adkins. Violence by the Klan and other violent persons continued through much of 1871, the year of the Ku Klux Klan Act. Stephen Ward Angell reported that Ayer and Adkins had been \\"brutally slaughtered because they dared to be Republicans, and possessed such an amount of integrity that they defied both bribes and threats.\\" References Category:Georgia (U.S. state) state senators Category:1869 deaths Category:Assassinated American politicians Category:19th-century American politicians Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians Category:Ku Klux Klan crimes Category:Race and crime in the United States Category:Georgia (U.S. state) Republicans Category:Murder in Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"Joseph Adkins"},{"id":"56947334","text":"Waldrada was the mistress, and later the wife, of Lothair II of Lotharingia. Biography Waldrada's family origin is uncertain. A prolific 19th-century French writer Baron Ernouf suggested that Waldrada was of noble Gallo-Roman family, Baron Ernouf (1858) Histoire de Waldrade, de Lother II et de leurs descendants, p. 3 sister of Thietgaud, the bishop of Trier, and niece of Ghunter, the archbishop of Cologne. Baron Ernouf (1858) Histoire de Waldrade, de Lother II et de leurs descendants, p. 5. However, these suggestions are not supported by any evidence, and more recent studies have instead suggested she was of relatively undistinguished social origins, though still from an aristocratic milieu. K. Schmid, Ein karolingischer Königseintrag im Gedenkbuch von Remiremont, Frühmittelalterliche Studien, 2, 1968, pp. 96-134 The Vita Sancti Deicoli states that Waldrada was related to Eberhard II, Count of Nordgau (included Strasbourg) family of Etichonids, though this is a late 10th-century source and so may not be entirely reliable on this question.Monumenta Germanica Historica, tomus XV.2, Vita Sancti Deicoli, p. 679. In 855 the Carolingian king Lothar II married Teutberga, a Carolingian aristocrat and the daughter of Bosonid Boso the Elder. The marriage was arranged by Lothar's father Lothar I for political reasons.Monumenta Germanica Historica, tomus I: Annales Lobienses, anno 855, p. 232 It is very probable that Waldrada was already Lothar II's mistress at this time. Teutberga was allegedly not capable of bearing children and Lothar's reign was chiefly occupied by his efforts to obtain an annulment of their marriage, and his relations with his uncles Charles the Bald and Louis the German were influenced by his desire to obtain their support for this endeavour. Lothair, whose desire for annulment was prompted by his affection for Waldrada, put away Teutberga, but Hucbert took up arms on her behalf, and after she had submitted successfully to the ordeal of water, Lothair was compelled to restore her in 858. Still pursuing his purpose, he won the support of his brother, Emperor Louis II, by a cession of lands and obtained the consent of the local clergy to the annulment and to his marriage with Waldrada, which took place in 862. With the support of Charles the Bald and Louis the German, Teutberga appealed the annulment to Pope Nicholas I. Nicholas refused to recognize the annulment and excommunicated Waldrada in 866, forcing Lothair to abandon Waldrada in favour of Teutberga. Children Waldrada and Lothair II had some sons and probably three daughters, all of whom were declared illegitimate: *Hugh ( 855-895), Duke of Alsace (867-885) *Gisela ( 865-908), who in 883 married Godfrey, the Viking leader ruling in Frisia, who was murdered in 885 *Bertha ( 863-925), who married Theobald of Arles (c. 854-895), count of Arles, nephew of Teutberga. They had two sons Hugh of Italy and Boso of Tuscany. After Theobald's death, between 895 and 898 she married Adalbert II of Tuscany (c. 875-915) They had at least three children: Guy,Townsend, Geo (1847) Ecclesiastical and Civil History Philosophically Considered, Vol. II, p. 157 who succeeded his father as count and duke of Lucca and margrave of Tuscany, Lambert succeeded his brother in 929, but lost the titles in 931 to his half-brother Boso of Tuscany, and Ermengard. *Ermengarde (d. 90?) *Odo (d. c.879) References Category:Carolingian dynasty Category:Mistresses of Frankish royalty Category:Frankish queens consort Category:Lotharingian queens consort Category:Women of the Carolingian Empire ","title":"Waldrada of Lotharingia"},{"id":"56947335","text":"Conasprella bianchii is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Conidae, the cone snails, cone shells or cones.MolluscaBase (2018).

Bill history =Background= In Texas, no city had formally declared \\"sanctuary\\" status, but a few did not fully cooperate with federal immigration authorities and drew a negative response from the legislature.Doyin Oyeniyi, Does Texas Have Any Sanctuary Cities?, Texas Monthly (February 11, 2016). Bills seeking to deprive state funding from police departments and municipalities that do not cooperate with federal authorities had been introduced into the Texas Legislature several times. On February 1, 2017, Texas Governor Greg Abbott blocked funding to Travis County, Texas due to its recently implemented de facto sanctuary city policy. The Travis County incident inspired the passage of Texas Senate Bill 4. =Legislative history= Texas Senate Bill 4 was first introduced into the Texas Legislature on November 15, 2016. It passed the Texas Senate on February 8, 2017, by a vote of 20–10. The bill then went to the Texas House of Representatives, where it passed on April 27, 2017, by a vote of 94–53, with one representative voting \\"present.\\" Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed the bill into law on May 7, 2017. Legal challenges On August 30, 2017, Judge Orlando Luis Garcia of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas blocked certain sections of Senate Bill 4 from going into effect, including the part requiring local officials to honor federal detainers. The State of Texas appealed the ruling and on September 25, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that those provisions could temporarily go into effect as the court heard the arguments over the case. March 13, 2018, the Fifth Circuit again ruled that most of the law, except for a portion punishing officials who \\"endorse\\" sanctuary city policies, could go into effect while the case was pending.

Dating to about 1735, it is a well-preserved example of a rural farmstead. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history The William Noyes Farmstead is located in southeastern Ledyard, its buildings set on either side of Gallup Hill Road west of its junction with Shewville Road. The house and a small barn are on the south side, while a larger barn is set close to the road on the north side. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. It is oriented with its main facade to the south, away from the road, and is separated from the road by a fence. The front is five bays wide, with the entrance slight off center, framed by Federal period pilasters, transom window, and entablature. Both barns are set on rubblestone foundations, and are of post and beam framing. The larger one has been adapted for use as a studio. The oldest portion of this house, probably its western half, was built about 1735 by William Noyes. The house was likely enlarged by James Woodbridge, who acquired the property from a member of the Noyes family in 1783, at which time it also received its Federal style. The house is unusual for its age in Ledyard, where most farm houses were 1-1/2 story Capes, and for its high state of preservation. The property remained in agricultural use into the early 1940s.

But his past comes back to haunt him when he's forced to take on one last job in order to help his less than useful son-in-law Terry (Martin Freeman), who has failed to pay his debt to a cutthroat loan shark, and must immediately cough up an enormous sum of money if he has any hope of emerging unscathed. Dresner organises a robbery in an attempt to help Terry, but the plan immediately goes wrong. Dresner finds himself caught in the sights of DS Edward Foster (Hugo Speer), who is struggling financially, and is eager to finally bringing him to justice after years of evading the law; and James Hilden (Lee Williams), a hotshot rookie lawyer who has recently married and has a baby on the way. =Part 2= Dresner finds himself caught up in a tangled web of lies, secrets and double-crossing, as he tries to find a way to save himself and his family. Not quite ready for his loss of independence, Hilden embarks on an affair with an ex-colleague, and agrees to take on Geoff's case, but unwittingly, his secret love life becomes caught up in his professional affairs, and before he knows it, he is stuck in a vicious circle of deceit and denial. Geoff soon realises that Hilden is unequipped with the experience or know-how to successfully defend him. Foster's second job as a night taxi driver continues to take its toll on his police work, and as a result, he is overlooked for promotion – but he soon realises that the Dresner investigation could be an opportunity for him to make the grade.

He was formerly an at- large member of the Montgomery County Council, first elected in 2006. Prior to that he served on the Takoma Park City Council for 19 years, representing Ward 5 which covers and incorporates the greater Long Branch / East Silver Spring area. He became the Democratic nominee for Montgomery County Executive in the 2018 primary before winning the general election against the Republican nominee Robin Ficker and an independent challenger Nancy Floreen. Early life and education Marc Elrich was born in Washington, D.C., near Takoma Park. His father was a postal worker and his mother, a waitress. When he was ten his family moved to Silver Spring. In 1963, when he was 14, he went to hear Martin Luther King Jr. at the March on Washington. He attended Albert Einstein High School in Kensington and the University of Maryland. He was once arrested at an anti-apartheid rally. An early job after graduating college was as a manager in the automotive department at Montgomery Ward where one of his responsibilities was helping to open new stores. He returned to school, getting a master's degree in teaching from Johns Hopkins University. Career =Education= Elrich taught 4th and 5th grade for 17 years at Rolling Terrace Elementary. He stated that his teaching showed him firsthand how poverty, poor living conditions and un-affordable housing can impact a child's ability to learn. He stated that seeing low income students come to school without breakfast and never having been to a doctor was some of the things that drives his public service. =County Council member-at-large= Elrich ran for the county council four times before getting elected in 2006. Since that time, he has served three terms. He was elected with the most votes of any candidate in 2010 and 2014. The Washington Post endorsed his candidacy in 2010 and 2014, stating that he was viewed as somewhat anti-business, but advocated a business-beneficial transit system and had a strong focus on efficiency and the development and planning process. He worked to have environmental concerns addressed in the Clarksburg Master Plan and he spearheaded the effort to protect Ten Mile Creek. The amendment that was passed requires development to supply environmental protections. He considered protecting the stream one of his highest environmental concerns at the time. He supported one bill protecting the tree canopy and sponsored another protecting street trees. Both were voted into law. He advocated for the elimination of cosmetic use of pesticides on private lawns because of their cancer-causing chemicals helping the county become the first locality in the country to do so and was considered a key co-sponsor of the legislation. He advocated against the use of artificial playing turfs that contain lead and other cancer-causing ingredients and sponsored a resolution banning crumb rubber turfs. He voted for the Montgomery county five cent bag tax to fund environmental cleanup efforts. He was lead sponsor of a bill to require large gas stations to be at least 500 feet from schools and parks. In 2013, Elrich was the lead sponsor of legislation to increase the county's minimum wage, which raised it to $11.50 per hour. Elrich twice was the lead sponsor of legislation to increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour in Montgomery County. In January 2017, a bill passed in the Council and was vetoed by then County Executive Ike Legget. In November 2017, a second bill passed and was signed into law, making Montgomery County the first county in Maryland with a $15 per hour minimum wage. At the time of the bill's passage, the State of Maryland's minimum wage was $9.25 per hour. Elrich voted against the White Flint Mall II sector plan because Elrich stated that the plan would have created 6,000 residential units located too far from a Metro station. He voted against the Bethesda Master Plan because it failed to consider the effect the increased density would have on roads and schools. He voted against the Lyttonsville Sector Plan because he stated that it would increase housing costs and force residents to move out, as well as the Chevy Chase Lake Sector Plan. He opposed a proposal to sell land adjacent to the White Oak Food and Drug Administration campus because local roads and infrastructure were not equipped to handle additional traffic and students. In 1995, he joined with community members and fought against a proposed mega mall in downtown Silver Spring. =County executive = In 2017, Elrich declared his candidacy for county executive. He participated in public financing. The largest allowed contribution is $150. He did not accept money from developers or land use attorneys. He received criticism when he described the council's plan to rezone neighborhoods around the proposed 16-mile purple line train as \\"ethnic cleansing\\". He said he was sorry if his language was offensive, but he defended his comment saying that this is not just a Montgomery County problem but a nationwide problem and a \\"well-known fact\\" of what happens when rail lines take over communities. Elrich supports policies such as $15 minimum wage and affordable housing that stabilize and support low-income families. On July 22, Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich signed an executive order prohibiting county officials from asking residents about their immigration status or cooperating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In November 2019, Elrich banned Montgomery County police stations from displaying Thin Blue Line flags. Acknowledging that the flag was a symbol of \\"support\\" to some and a symbol of \\"divisiveness\\" to others, he drew criticism from Governor Larry Hogan for the policy. Personal life Elrich has four children. Two were foster children, including a son who has Down Syndrome. He has lived in Takoma Park for most of his life. He is Jewish. 2018 elections =Primary election results= Primary election was held on June 26, 2018. =General election results= General election was held on November 6, 2018.

Immediately after graduating high school in 1943, Lonas joined the Army and was assigned as a gunner to the 987th Field Artillery Battalion, with which he served in Normandy, Ardenne, Rhineland, and Central Europe. After WWII, Lonas earned his Bachelor of Arts from the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, VA where he studied under renowned sculptor Professor Carl Roseberg.

After completing his service, Lonas returned to the University of Iowa and graduated with a master's degree in Art History in 1953. Obituary from The Washington Post, 29 September 2011 Upon his graduation at the University of Iowa, Lonas was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to study at the University of Fine Arts in Berlin, Germany, where he later became a professor. Lonas spent the majority of his artistic career in Berlin. At one time he worked at the prestigious art foundry Bildgießerei Hermann Noack in the city.

Fredrik Bagge was born in Marstrand 24 December 1646 to the Mayor Nils Bagge, and Malin Burgesdotter. After studies at the University of Copenhagen and the University of Uppsala, among other foreign universities, he was promoted to Doctor of Philosophy of the University of Wittenberg in 1667. Two years later he was appointed vicar in Marstrand. Bagges was acknowledged not only as a learned man, but also for his unshakeable loyalty to his fatherland. After the Danish- Norwegian victory against the Swedes in the Battle of Marstrand 1677, Fredrik Bagge was ordered to celebrate Te Deum and proclaim prayers to the King Christian V of Denmark and his armed forces. Instead, in the presence of the Danish Commander-in-chief and officers of the Danish invasion forces, he gave prayers to King Charles XI of Sweden and for his victory against Denmark–Norway. As a result, he was imprisoned in Carlsten by court-martial and sentenced to death. At the trial, he initiated a powerful speech in support of the Swedish crown, when a Danish officer ran up to him and put a hand on the vicar's mouth, insisting to General Ulrik Frederik Gyldenløve to \\"not let him speak, or else he will make ridicule of us all\\". He relocated to Fredriksten awaiting the outcome. Yet, as a wealthy man, he avoided the death sentence only by paying three-double man prices. Upon return of the Swedes to Marstrand, King Charles XI of Sweden bestowed him lavish praise, distinguishing him amonger things with the appointment to Rural Dean with annexes.

In his spare time, he took evening classes to further his education. This enabled him to enter the Liverpool School of Technology, where studied metal plate working, taking first class honours and the Bronze Medal of the City and Guilds. Following this, he studied at the University of Liverpool on a scholarship, and also with Ruskin College and the American School of Correspondence. In 1893, Kidd joined the Liverpool Society of Tin Plate Workers, and was elected to its committee one year later, as soon as he became eligible. The society was affiliated to the General Union of Braziers and Sheet Metal Workers, and in 1906, Kidd was elected as its assistant secretary, succeeding as its general secretary in 1913. In 1920, he took a leading role in a merger which formed the National Union of Sheet Metal Workers and Braziers, with Kidd initially serving as secretary of its number 2 district. He became the union's assistant general secretary in 1923, also serving on the Executive Committee of the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades (FEST). Concerned that the FEST did not provide for effective action, he successfully proposed that it was transformed into the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions. In addition, he served on the executive of the National Council of Labour Colleges, and taught social history to workers in his spare time. Kidd was also active in the Labour Party, and was a leading figure in the party in Clapham. Kidd finally succeeded as the union's general secretary in 1941, but he retired two years later.

These engagements were a part of the Black Sea campaigns between Axis and Soviet naval forces. Background As during the first 1941 campaign and the following year campaign, the Soviet Navy sent submarines against the Axis supply lines along the western coast of the Black Sea. Once again, Axis defenses primarily consisted of Romanian-laid fields of mines. At the beginning of the year the Soviet navy had 18 operable submarines (and 11 on refit), and organized them into \\"wolf packs\\" of groups of 3 with an attempted coordination with aircraft (though reports were often late). At first Soviet results were reduced due to effective German interception and the shallow drafts of many targets, however better results were scored after the summer with introduction of new torpedo fuses.

It includes the oldest parts of the city of Castroville and contains twelve designated contributing properties, including a Texas State Historic Site and numerous Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. History and significance Castroville was established in 1844 by Henri Castro, an empresario of the Republic of Texas, who brought several dozen European families from the Upper Rhine valley regions of Alsace and Baden to populate his land grant along the Medina River, some west of San Antonio. Long after its foundation the city retained a strongly Alsatian character, both in the continued common use of the Alsatian language into the mid-twentieth century, and in the Alsatian architecture that characterizes the community to the present day. The oldest portion of the city, surrounded on three sides by a bend in the Medina River, was designated a United States historic district on the National Register of Historic Places on April 3, 1970, in recognition of the old town's well-preserved colonial Alsatian architecture and unusual cultural heritage, for which it is known as the \\"little Alsace\\" of Texas. Castroville's was one of the first three United States historic districts to be designated in Texas. The NRHP nomination specified twelve contributing properties within the district, including the Landmark Inn State Historic Site (an NRHP-listed site in its own right), St. Louis Catholic Church, and a number of private residences exemplifying the prevailing architectural style. Including some of these twelve properties, the district contains numerous Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks, many of them especially well-preserved residences of early colonists. Architectural character The structures surveyed during the designation of the historic district, constructed between 1844 and the 1880s, share common architectural elements that mark the old town's Alsatian character. The oldest houses typically contain two rooms and a loft, with thick, stuccoed limestone walls, beams of cypress or cedar wood, and sloping, gabled roofs of tin or cypress wood shingles. A kitchen is typically either attached as a rear shed or built into a nearby free-standing structure. The houses are generally set close to the fronts of their lots, and many have full-width front porches.

The home was established to deal with the problem of stranded lascars in London who by law were unable to obtain employment to return to their home countries. In 1867, Salter found small groups of stranded Asians all over Britain. He worried about the effect of the \\"heathen mind\\" being exposed to European sin as well as the sin of its homeland and attempted to convert those he met to Christianity but his efforts were generally received only with polite indifference.\\"Patterns of Resistance: Indian Seamen in Imperial Britain\\" by Shompa Lahiri in In December 1886, the Home had declared its intention to evict five Punjabi performers and their bear.

The screenplay was co-written by Böhm and Florian Eder. The plot follows Anna, a blossoming teenager who uncovers the dark secret behind her traumatic childhood. The film premiered at South by Southwest on March 10, 2018 and has received favorable reviews. It was released in the United States in select theaters and on video on demand on April 13, 2018, by IFC Films under their IFC Midnight brand. Plot Anna (Aviva Winick) spends her childhood in the care of a man whom she believes to be her father. He keeps her confined in her attic bedroom, warning her of a child-eating monster called the Wildling that roams the woods. When Anna (now played by Bel Powley) reaches puberty, \\"Daddy\\" begins giving her leuprolide to suppress estrogen production, under the guise of treating her \\"illness\\". By the time she reaches 16, she begins to suffer near fatal side effects from the lueprolide. \\"Daddy\\" attempts to give her a mercy kill at her request but instead turns the gun on himself which fails. Anna wakes up in a hospital after being found by Sheriff Ellen Cooper (Liv Tyler). She helps Anna start her new life as a normal teenager, taking her home where Anna befriends Ellen's younger brother Ray while also giving Anna a bath and shaving her legs. Anna's body starts to develop, having been stunted by the leuprolide. While chasing a deer in the forest, she is prevented from getting caught in a trap by a half blind man in a wolf skin. Ellen reveals to Anna that the hospital ran a DNA test and \\"Daddy\\", whose name is revealed to be Gabriel Hanson, is not her biological father. He remains in a coma in the hospital and has been slightly disfigured from his self inflicted gunshot wound. In the school library, Anna finds pictures of the Northern Lights and feels a strong pull. The Northern lights come alive on the pages and she realizes her senses are particularly acute, allowing her to hear other girls making fun of her being barefoot. Ellen has put a pretty yellow dress in Anna's room. Anna wears the dress when Ray takes her to a friend's party, where they share a brief romantic moment. Anna's mouth begins to bleed spontaneously, and she loses some of her teeth. Ray calls to her through the bathroom door, but Anna escapes through the window. When Lawrence Fuller, a local bully, follows Anna and attempts to rape her, she mistakes him for a Wildling and kills him by biting through his throat. Confused and frightened, Anna runs away in her underwear and stumbles across her childhood home, where she finds some clothes and wonders whether she might be turning into a Wildling herself. The next day, a barefoot Anna returns to town, having realized that her bleeding mouth was caused by her human teeth being pushed out for sharper teeth, and observing that her nails are turning into claws. She refuses to talk to Ellen, and runs into the woods, where she encounters The Wolf Man. He tells her that the Wildlings were killed in the last 'purge' sixteen years ago, and directs her to a cavern, where he says she will find her mother. Discovering her mother's sharp-toothed skull, Anna has a vision that reveals that her mother was killed by \\"Daddy\\" before he took her away as a baby. Shaken, she sees him at the hospital, where he has awakened from his coma. She returns to Ellen's home, and hugs Ellen, who has promised to take care of her. Anna doesn't understand why Ellen clicks handcuffs on her wrists. Lawrence's body has been discovered next to Anna's yellow party dress. She is arrested and taken to a cell in the local jail. That night, Anna is visited by \\"Daddy\\" in jail. He tells her that she was a mistake and gives her a syringe that he implies contains a lethal dose of her medication. Anna refuses to take it and escapes. Ray agrees to drive Anna north into the forest, where she hopes they can find the Northern Lights. The two have sex that night, Ray assuring her that he is not concerned about the changes in her body when her claws have grown longer and there is hair on her back. The next day, Anna finds that claws have grown on her feet as well which Ray compliments. Ray is injured by a group of hunters led by Gabriel. He says he must find his way back to the car, but Anna runs the other way and leaves him. Months later, the hunters corner Anna in the forest. A now dark-skinned, near- furry, and animalistic Anna kills Ellen's deputy Roger after he threatens to shoot her. Ellen lowers her gun and allows her to escape when she sees that Anna is pregnant. The hunters start a forest fire that forces Anna to dig into the cavern. After ripping off her clothes and now sporting stretched-out feet, she is shot by \\"Daddy\\" with a tranquilizer dart. He attempts to perform a c-section on her to claim the unborn child. If the child is a girl, he promises her that he will name her Anna. Anna fights off the drugs and kills \\"Daddy\\" by opening her lower jaw wide to tear his throat out before collapsing. She regains consciousness when the Wolf Man finds her and stitches up her wound from the attempted caesarean. The next morning, Ellen and Ray are part of the group exploring the burned forest. Although they see Anna on the other side of a lake, they allow her to escape into the wilderness. Weeks later, Anna has traveled far and is finally able to see the Northern Lights. Anna is now fully transformed into a Wildling with black skin and black fur. In her hands, she holds her newborn child. Far in the distance, she hears the call of another Wildling.

The film was produced by Maven Pictures (US) in co-production with Arri Media (German), Film i Väst and Filmgate Films (both Swedish) and in association with IM Global and Night Fox Entertainment. International sales were handled by IM Global, which first introduced the film to buyers at the European Film Market (EFM) during the 2016 Berlin International Film Festival. On February 18, 2016 Screen International announced that UK rights were acquired by Warner Bros. On February 19, 2016 Deadline Hollywood reported the closing of distribution deals for Latin America, South Africa, Switzerland, Portugal, Middle East, Turkey, Thailand, Israel, Ex-Yugoslavia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Baltic States and Vietnam. On February 7, 2018, Variety reported acquisition of the film's release rights in the United States by IFC Films. = Casting = On October 5, 2015, Deadline Hollywood announced the casting of Bel Powley and Liv Tyler for the lead roles. In an interview with Film Inquiry, Bel Powley talked about what originally drew her to the film, saying, \\"I've always wanted projects that kind of subvert tradition and the norm, and I think that's something that Wildling really did from the first draft I read.\\" With Inverse, Powley described the film as a \\"story about becoming a woman in our society and the obstacles you're faced with.\\" In an interview with Vulture she explained, \\"What Anna goes through in the movie is symbolic of what every girl goes through when they become a woman.\\" Brad Dourif said in an interview with Rue Morgue, \\"When I was first offered the part [of Daddy] I wasn't initially going to do it. But before I actually said no, I wanted to talk to the director [Fritz Böhm] first. I told him about how, as a parent, I was interested in the idea of it, but that I wanted to play the character in a certain way. We worked through it, and after our discussion I wanted to be a part of the film. It was really the theme of fatherhood that compelled me to take it on.\\" = Photography = Production was first announced on October 5, 2015 and filming took place in late 2015 over 23 shooting days in various locations in the state of New York, including a natural stretch of the Bronx River within the Bronx Zoo, the town of Congers, the Sleepy Hollow police station, Rockland Lake State Park and Inwood Hill Park, Manhattan. In an interview with Deadline Hollywood, Böhm spoke about the challenges of working with child actors, water scenes, animals and special effects makeup on a limited budget and schedule. During a Q&A; in the Arena Cinelounge Hollywood, Böhm revealed that the film's elaborate cave sequences were entirely shot in a warehouse in Brooklyn against blue screen, \\"since real caves don't exist within the 23 mile radius of Columbus Circle, Manhattan in which the movie had to be shot in order to fulfill the requirements for New York City's film incentive program.\\" Production designer Lauren Fitzsimmons told audiences at South by Southwest that the attic of \\"Daddy's house\\", which is seen in the first 15 minutes of the film, was a set she \\"built in the same Brooklyn warehouse in which the cave scenes were shot\\". In a Q&A; at the IFC Center (New York City) moderated by Boaz Yakin, Böhm explained that, during the editing process, he drove to the Redwood National Forest in Northern California to shoot additional nature footage by himself as a \\"one man second unit\\". = Post-production = Böhm worked with Arri Media in Munich, Germany where the film was mixed in the Dolby Atmos format. The film was color-timed by Florian \\"Utsi\\" Martin, and film editor Peter Boyle served as creative consultant in the editing process. The film comprises roughly 350 visual effect shots, for which Böhm utilized his background as a post-production supervisor and visual effects artist in his native Germany.

Vicki Woods of Morbidly Beautiful called the film \\"a powerful fable\\". She wrote in her review, \\"Wildling is a moodily atmospheric thriller combining supernatural scares with a myth-like tale of self-discovery and a beautiful coming-of-age tale\\" and \\"the acting throughout is terrific, but it is Bel Powley that takes the movie to another level.\\" Heather Wixon of Daily Dead wrote, \\"Powley delivers a truly powerful portrayal\\". Charles Early wrote on Austin360, \\"Director Fritz Bohm has created a misunderstood creature for the ages\\". Brian Williams of The Hollywood Outsider wrote, \\"The masterful direction of Wildling cannot be overstated. With only a two million dollar budget, Böhm pulls off a cinematic miracle that can only be compared to some of the independent upstart movies like Desperado and Clerks in that the budget-to-quality ratio is off the charts.\\" Alex Arabian of Film Inquiry called Wildling a \\"wildly original creature feature that transcends the horror genre\\" and the third act \\"visually rewarding\\". He wrote \\"Wildling is a film about growing up as an outsider, becoming a woman, being free from oppression, and loving your body as it is.\\" He also pointed out the performances by the main cast, writing \\"Horror legend, iconic character actor, and Oscar nominee Brad Dourif, Liv Tyler, and rising star Bel Powley (The Diary of a Teenage Girl) give a trio of superb performances. As the central and titular character, Powley delivers yet another powerhouse performance, following her The Diary of a Teenage Girl and Carrie Pilby roles.\\" He also noted the work of cinematographer Toby Oliver, writing he did \\"a phenomenal job lighting and shooting the film\\". Paul D'Agostino of Hyperallergic called the film \\"captivating\\" and wrote \\"Fritz Böhm's debut film Wildling is cloaked in mystery, dark and dank, occasionally bloody, sometimes shocking, and fantastically folkloric.\\" D'Agostino compared Wildling to Tomas Alfredson's Let The Right One In and a number of films by Guillermo del Toro and M. Night Shyamalan. Looper called Wildling \\"one of the best movies of 2018\\".

Mithqal was one of the two leading sheikhs of Bani Sakhr, he took power in the early twentieth century, and headed the Al-Twaga half of the Bani Sakhr tribe, which consisted of the Al-Ghbein, Al-Amir, Al-Ka'abna, Al-Hgeish, Al-Saleet, and Al-Taybeen clans. He also headed his own clan, Al-Fayez. Early life Mithqal Sattam Al-Fayez was born into the family of the leading shaykhs of the Bani Sakhr tribal confederacy around the year 1880. For two generations, his immediate family had led the confederacy, one of the largest and strongest nomadic tribal groups in the Syrian Desert. As such, his childhood was spent in preparation for the title and job of a shaykh, the tribal leader. An Arab shaykh had to demonstrate the virtues of wisdom, charisma, generosity, and courage, find victory in battle, and develop an intimate knowledge of the desert. He would hone his negotiating skills to represent the tribe vis-à-vis other tribes and government officials and would need to secure economic resources for himself and his people. At the conclusion of this long training and learning process, this boy would still be expected to compete with his brothers, cousins, and nephews for the leadership of the Bani Sakhr people. Mithqal’s childhood years occurred during a time of a great change in the desert. A decade prior to his birth, the Ottoman Empire had begun incorporating the southern regions of its Syrian province, east of the Jordan River, into its central rule. The tribes, long accustomed to their local rule and autonomy, suddenly had to adjust to sharing power with the Ottoman government. The success of Mithqal’s grandfather (Fandi) and father(Sattam) in adapting to this new political reality was crucial. Their legacy paved the way for Mithqal’s own greatness at a time of great geopolitical transformations. It also shaped the future leader’s worldview, one that would guide him throughout his entire life. Rise to power Mithqal was gifted with exceptional military skills, which he had acquired while still with the Ruwala. Now, back with the Bani Sakhr, he had plenty of opportunities to demonstrate them. Mithqal quickly made a name for himself as a leader of raids. Though there are no concrete details on the actual battles in which he took part, a few pieces of information illustrate his military role among the Bani Sakhr and the reputation he earned as a result. Ultimately, his success and courage earned him valuable credentials, as expected from a member of a respectable shaykhly family, providing him with the springboard to the position of leadership. Mithqal had another advantage while he was making his way. The fact that his elder brother, Fawwaz, was the leader of the Bani Sakhr greatly strengthened his political position. Even if there was some tension between the brothers at first, they soon reconciled, and Mithqal became Fawwaz’s right-hand man. A newspaper report from 1913 implies that the two shaykhs were acting as partners in the leadership of the Bani Sakhr under Ottoman patronage. By that time, they were generally known for their friendship with the government and faced internal opposition for that reason. When a famous warrior of the Bani Sakhr and an outlaw wanted to defy the government, he set fire to Mithqal’s and Fawwaz’s threshing floors and stole their cattle.16 Fawwaz’s reliance on Mithqal may have been the result of affection for his young brother, regard for his military skills, or fear of his power and potential competition. Whatever the case, Mithqal was an asset to Fawwaz as a military leader, particularly in light of the unstable relations between the tribes and the Ottoman government and the impending threat of the Young Turks to curtail their autonomy. Upon Fawwaz’s death in the summer of 1917, Mithqal saw himself as the new leader and made his first bid to become the shaykh of shaykhs of the Bani Sakhr. A British intelligence report indicated that Mithqal “was mentioned as his successor.”23 However, Mithqal lost to his seventeen-year-old nephew, Mashhur, the son of the deceased leader. The tribal council preferred the young Mashhur, who was a graduate of a school in Damascus, to the illiterate Mithqal, even though the latter was more mature and experienced. One of the first decisions concerning tribal affairs that Abdullah was to take had considerable implications for Mithqal’s career. Abdullah recognized Mithqal as the new shaykh of shaykhs of the Bani Sakhr. This promotion came immediately after the death of the incumbent Mashhur in intertribal fighting and was apparently a natural and uncontested choice. Finally, Mithqal’s title matched his actual status. With this appointment, Mithqal attained the goal he had been striving to achieve for years. Role in Jordan's agriculture Mithqal inherited his father's interest in agriculture, and further developed and cultivated the lands in Jordan for barely, wheat, lentils, olives, and other vegetables. Mithqal's role in Jordan's agriculture was crucial for the well-being of the country, as he was the first person to import a mechanical tractor and plough in the country's history. The effect of this purchase has helped the country out of a poverty-stricken famine in the mid-1930s as the production of wheat and barely has increased from 40,000 tons and 16,000 from 1936 to 113,000 tons and 53,000 tons in 1937; this effectively tripled the food supply of the land and helped in feeding its inhabitants. This increase in production has also tripled Jordan's food exports during those years, which opened the much needed revenue for the poverty stricken Transjordan of that time. Ambush of the 1930s Mithqal was riding his mare in the desert accompanied by only one man. It was during the winter season, and the Bani Sakhr had migrated east towards Wadi Sirhan. Suddenly, Mithqal and his escort were surprised by an ambush set by members of an enemy tribe. A bullet grazed the side of Mithqal’s head, almost killing him, and he was hit in the shoulder. Mithqal and his escort fired back and managed to drive off their attackers, but Mithqal was badly wounded. His escort tied a piece of cloth around his bleeding shoulder, pulled him over his mare, and rode on quickly to seek aid. They arrived in the nearby camp of a Bani Sakhr tribesman and asked for his help in fetching a car to take Mithqal to a hospital. He sent one of his men by camel to the encampment of Shaykh Haditha al-Khuraysha, who in turn sent a messenger to Amman. A car finally arrived, but in the meantime, Mithqal was suffering from loss of blood and in great pain. Mithqal spent twenty days in an Amman hospital. He survived, but the damage was irreversible. For the rest of his life, he could hardly use that arm, which dangled nearly lifeless from his shoulder. Imprisonment of Major General Fredrick Peake In 1919, over a decade long land dispute, Major General Fredrick Peake pursued a meeting with Mithqal to discuss the dispute. However, Mithqal choose to stay in his family's headquarters in Um Al Amad, which then prompted Peake to approach him unarmed to avoid a large conflict. Initially, Mithqal agreed to his request, however the day after Mithqal ordered the arrest of the Major General, which led to Peake to stay in the stables of the Al-Fayez for at least a day. It is unclear why Mithqal ordered the arrest of Peake, and although Peake rights unfavorably of Mithqal in an undermining manner in his books, he reported \\"bore no grudge\\" according to C.S. Jarvis's biography of the Peake. Last years Mithqal's health soon began deteriorating soon after the death in 1962 of his favorite wife ‘Adul, ‘Akif’s mother, which was a severe blow to Mithqal. In the last five years of his life, he suffered from progressively declining health. Though he was fortunate enough to receive superb medical treatment in Cairo, Beirut, and Europe, diabetes and other age-related illnesses brought about his death in his late eighties in April 1967. Jordan after Mithqal Even in death Mithqal played a fateful role in Jordanian politics. In 1967, an election was held following the dissolution of Parliament, which, under ‘Akif’s leadership, was hostile to the government of Wasfi al-Tall, Jordan’s most celebrated prime minister. Wasfi was determined to bring about the downfall of his bitter enemy ‘Akif by supporting another candidate for the Bani Sakhr seat. But in order to prevent this further blow to the bereaved family, King Hussein intervened personally and secured ‘Akif’s election. Thus, in dying, as it turned out, Mithqal had secured a prominent position for his son for many years to come. Two months later, Jordan lost the West Bank to Israel in the Six Day War, and since its Parliament was elected by voters on both banks of the Jordan River, no general elections could take place until the country’s political disengagement from the West Bank. This did not occur until 1988, and in the interim, ‘Akif was able to keep his seat, holding it for the next twenty-one years and even serving as speaker of Parliament again between 1984 and 1988. The mourning period was over and the dignitaries and ordinary people left Mithqal’s house. The bereaved family was left to deal with the huge void created by Mithqal’s demise. It was undisputed that the elder son, ‘Akif, would become the head of the family and the main bearer of his father’s legacy. But he was not recognized as shaykh of shaykhs. Perhaps Mithqal was too large a personality to be replaced by anyone else. Besides, times were changing, and King Hussein’s drive to modernize the country suggested that such institutions were anachronistic. Whatever his reasons, the king had a perfect excuse, and for many years that seat had remained vacant. One of the first things the family did was to gather to distribute Mithqal’s huge landholdings. By the time of his death, Mithqal had accumulated at the very least 120,000 dunams (30,000 acres). By his instructions, two grandchildren, the sons of his eldest son Sultan, whom he raised as his own after their father’s premature death, enjoyed equal shares of the inheritance.1 Several years later, the family sold a large portion of that land to the Jordanian government. Today, Amman International Airport stands on what used to be Mithqal’s fields and the pastures in which his camels and sheep grazed. References # Aṣ-Ṣalībī Kamāl Sulaymān.

He participated in a number of U.S. military conflicts including the Spanish–American War, the Philippine–American War and World War I.  Early life and education  Darrah was born in Marquette, Kansas on 11 July 1873 to Samuel Jones Darrah and Mary, née Temperly. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point on 1895, one of his classmates was Joe Wheeler Jr., the son of Joseph Wheeler, former Confederate cavalry general and later U.S. Army major general. Later in life, Darrah also graduated from the Army School of the Line (1920), the Army Staff College (1921) and the Army War College (1923).  Military career  In 1895, Darrah was commissioned Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Army. He took part in the Spanish–American War, serving as a member of the sanitary corps in Cuba, and then in the subsequent Philippine–American War, during the Moro Rebellion from 1903–1905.

It documents the approved standard procedures for performing operations safely to produce goods and provide services. Compliance with the operations manual will generally be considered as activity approved by the persons legally responsible for the organisation. The operations manual is intended to remind employees of how to do their job. The manual is either a book or folder of printed documents containing the standard operating procedures, a description of the organisational hierarchy, contact details for key personnel and emergency procedures. It does not substitute for training, but should be sufficient to allow a trained and competent person to adapt to the organisation's specific procedures. The operations manual helps the members of the organisation to reliably and efficiently carry out their tasks with consistent results. A good manual will reduce human error and inform everyone precisely what they need to do, who they are responsible to and who they are responsible for. It is a knowledge base for the organisation, and should be available for reference whenever needed. The operations manual is a document that should be periodically reviewed and updated whenever appropriate to ensure that it remains current.  Format  The operations manual can be a digital or paper document. Digital format has advantages for revision control and can be distributed easily and at low cost. The detail should be sufficient to allow a competent person without specific experience to understand what is needed and how it is to be done. It is not a training manual, too much or too little detail can make it inefficient.  Contents  Content will vary depending on the organisation, but some basic structure is fairly universal. Typical sections include: * Organisational hierarchy * Job descriptions * Contact details * Documented processes and systems * Occupational health and safety instructions * Emergency procedures * Company History * Products & Services * Policies and position statements There are two basic categories of information: Information that is relevant to all people in the organisation, and often also to clients and the general public, and information that is relevant to specific positions. There may be statutory or regulatory requirements for specific content. In some cases the CEO may be required to authorise the operations manual by signature, and this authorisation may be required to be present in the document. A version number and date of commencement may be required, and it may be a controlled document. = Organogram = The organisational hierarchy is commonly and effectively described by an organisational chart, or organogram, a diagram that shows the structure of an organization and the relationships and relative ranks of its sections and members which gives the reader an easily understood picture of where key people fit into the organisation. = Job descriptions = A job description is a document that describes the general tasks, duties, and responsibilities of a position, and may specify the functionary to whom the position reports, specifications such as the competence, qualifications, registration, certification or skills needed by the person in the job, and a salary range. Formal job descriptions help people understand their roles within the organisation and identify each other's responsibilities. = Contact details = These include names and contact details for key persons within the organisation and important external contacts. = Documented processes = = Occupational health and safety instructions = * Risk assessments and risk management policies = Emergency procedures = Any emergency procedure that would be the standard response to a reasonably foreseeable emergency in the normal course of business would be detailed in the operations manual as a reference. There might also be specifications on how frequently exercises should be held. Some frequently encountered emergency procedures include: *Evacuation plans *Fire drills *Response to release of hazardous materials *Disaster recovery plan. How to re-establish operations following an unexpected catastrophic event. = Policies = A policy is a deliberate system of principles to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes. A policy is a statement of intent, and is implemented as a procedure or protocol. Policies are generally adopted by a governance body within an organization. Policies can assist in both subjective and objective decision making. Policies to assist in subjective decision making usually assist senior management with decisions that must be based on the relative merits of a number of factors, and as a result are often hard to test objectively, e.g. work-life balance policy. In contrast policies to assist in objective decision making are usually operational in nature and can be objectively tested, e.g. password policy.  Annexures and references Manuals that already exist for equipment or procedures may be incorporated into an operations manual as annexures, or referenced if they are not of general utility, so they can be found when needed and checked for continued validity when the operations manual is revised.  Revision, updates and distribution  If an operations manual is to be useful it must be distributed to the people who will use it, and they should have the current version. Distribution and updating policies and procedures are also commonly part of the content of the manual.  Specific requirements in industry  = Commercial diving = In South Africa a diving contractor is obliged in terms of Regulation 21 of the Diving Regulations 2009 to provide an operations manual and make it available on site to the dive team before a diving operation may commence. This manual must contain prescribed types of information relating to health and safety, as specified in the codes of practice relating to the planned diving operations. The Code of Practice for Inshore Diving requires the contractor to base the planning and implementation of diving operations on specific documents which include the operations manual. The operations manual is considered an essential administrative risk control measure, and must be compiled by the contractor in consultation with representatives of the employees and the company's contracted diving medical practitioner. Members of the diving team are required to comply with the health and safety requirements imposed on them by the operations manual. Among other things that must be specified in the operations manual are the decompression tables or algorithms authorised for use by the dive teams, the quantities of breathing gas that must be available on site, based on the dive profile and equipment to be used, clear limits on the environmental hazards to which the divers may be exposed, and the actions required of each member of the dive team in the event of an emergency during operations. Similar requirements may apply to commercial diving contractors in other jurisdictions. The IMCA Code of Practice for Offshore Diving also requires the contractor to provide an operations manual for each diving system. = Commercial airlines = * ICAO requirements.

Early years (1839–85) Pierre-Paul de Casabianca was born in Bastia, Corsica, on 13 September 1839. He was the brother of Joseph Luce de Casabianca(fr). He became a lawyer. On 21 August 1881 he ran for election to the chamber of deputies as a Republican candidate and gained 6,533 votes against 7,406 for the Bonapartist candidate Denis Gavini, who was elected. Casabianca was among the leaders of the Opportunist Republicans who supported Emmanuel Arène in his successful bid in the legislative by-election for the Corte constituency in 1881. The Casabianca family was influential in the north of Corsica. During the reform of the judicial organization, in August 1883 Casabianca's father became president of the Bastia Court of Appeal with two of his cousins as advisers. The presidents of the courts of Corte and Bastia were both cousins of Casabianca, who was president of the Corsican general council from 1883 to 1885. In the case of the railway from Ajaccio to Bastia the jurors who reviewed the expropriations were appointed by the general council, and Casabianca presented the case as lawyer for the railway company. Senator (1885–1903) On 25 January 1885 Casabianca was elected Senator of Corsica by 477 out of 744 votes. He defeated the Bonapartist Joseph Marie Piétri, who won only 212 votes. He sat with the moderate left. Casabianca led the branch of the Corsican Republican party that rejected the former Bonapartist party and Arène's more extreme Republican group. In the mid-1880s he was the main republican leader, while Arène was still only his lieutenant and not yet \\"King of Corsica.\\" He supported the successive ministries. In the last session he voted for reinstatement of the single-member ballot, for the draft Lisbonne law restricting freedom of the press, and abstained from voting on the case of General Boulanger. In 1893 the Gavini and Casabianca families met in Vichy and made a pact to unite and seize political power from Arène and eliminate him from departmental decision making. However, by 1895 Arène was again the undisputed master of Corsican politics. Casabianca was reelected on 7 January 1894 in the first round by 434 out of 747 votes. In the elections of 4 January 1903 he was defeated by Émile Combes. In a by-election on 15 February 1903 Arthur Ranc was elected Senator for Corsica in place of Émile Combes, who had also been elected for Charente-Inférieure, which he had chosen to represent. Last years (1903–16) After losing his senate seat Casabianca renounced politics. Although formerly president of the Corsican general council, he did not run in the 1910 cantonal elections. However, he agreed to run for election to the senate on 7 January 1912 on his party's list against that of Paul Doumer, but was defeated. He was elected to the general council for Vescovato. He ran in the legislative elections on 26 April 1914, but retired after being beaten in the first round by Henri Pierangeli(fr). Casabianca died in Bastia on 12 March 1916 at the age of 77.

The manga was serialized in the manga magazine Dear+ from 2013 to 2017, and will be adapted into an anime television series in 2020. Two puzzle game adaptations based on the manga were released. Plot Tadaomi Shirotani suffers from obsessive–compulsive disorder that manifests as severe mysophobia. He meets psychotherapist Riku Kurose, who recommends exposure and response prevention therapy and instructs Shirotani to write a list of ten actions he is unable to do: Kurose tells Shirotani he will be cured once he completes the items on the list. Shirotani makes steady progress on the list, until Kurose abruptly suspends their sessions; when pressed, he admits he has fallen in love with Shirotani, and felt it would be inappropriate to continue as his therapist. Shirotani nevertheless wishes to continue their sessions, and they resume therapy while simultaneously initiating a sexual relationship. Through a flashback, it transpires that the root cause of Shirotani's mysophobia is a childhood trauma of witnessing his father having sex: the self-loathing he experienced after becoming aroused by the sight of his father, combined with the shame of being caught masturbating to the incident, prompted him to associate physical contact and intimacy with feelings of disgust. As Kurose and Shirotani's relationship intensifies, Kurose notes that Shirotani is simultaneously repulsed and sexually aroused by his advances. Kurose reveals that he is a sadist who derives pleasure from triggering Shirotani's mysophobia, and has intuited that Shirotani is a masochist who derives pleasure from the very acts that disgust him. Shirotani rejects Kurose, and they do not speak for many months. After a chance encounter, Kurose and Shirotani reconcile their relationship. Shirotani reveals the tenth item on his list – to be patted on the head, an act he associates with his father – and admits that he loves Kurose. Shirotani finds he is now comfortable enough to reciprocate Kurose sexually. In an epilogue, Kurose quits his clinic job to study for a doctorate in psychology. Shirotani, having completed the list, has significantly alleviated the symptoms of his mysophobia. Kurose admits that he was lying when said that completing the list would cure Shirotani's mysophobia, and proposes a second list to make amends: a list of ten actions that Shirotani wishes for Kurose to do.

He currently serves as the Dean for the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at New York University. Harper is best known for his work in modern and contemporary literature, African American literature and culture, and gender and sexuality studies.  Work  Harper's fields of study include modern and contemporary U.S. literary and cultural studies; African American literary, cultural, and fine art studies; aesthetics and social theory; and gender and sexuality studies. His 1997 book, Private Affairs: Critical Ventures in the Culture of Social Relations, he explores the social and cultural significance of the private, proposing that privacy is limited by one's racial-and sexual-minority status. Art critic Douglas Crimp wrote,\\" Private Affairs teaches us how thoroughly complex is the negotiation of privacy and publicity when we attend to gender and sexuality, race and class.\\" In 2015, Harper published Abstractionist Aesthetics: Artistic Form and Social Critique in African American Culture, a series of essays arguing for displacing realism as the primary mode of African American representational aesthetics. Rather, Harper argues, cultural producers should re-center literature as a principal site of African American cultural politics and elevate experimental prose within the domain of African American literature. The book explored the artistic practices of visual artists Fred Wilson and Kara Walker, the music of Billie Holiday and Cecil Taylor, and the writings of Ntozake Shange, Alice Walker, and John Keen. Professor Brent Hayes Edwards of Columbia University wrote, Harper was previously Director of Graduate Studies of American Studies, English, and SCA; Director of the American Studies and Gender and Sexuality Programs; and Chair of the Department of English. He is a Founding Chair of the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis, along with scholars Jose Esteban-Muñoz, Lisa Duggan, Carolyn Dinshaw, Ann Pellegrini, and Jack Tchen.

Scott was born in West Lothian. When he was fifteen years old, he joined the Royal Navy, serving during World War I. In 1919, he moved to work in the Merchant Navy, in ships' engine rooms. He remained in this post until 1934, when he was appointed as the National Union of Seamen's (NUS) full-time delegate in Glasgow. Scott continued his career with the NUS when, in 1940, he was appointed as a branch secretary in Grangemouth, then four years later, he became the union's representative in Mumbai, soon moving on to similar posts in Canada and the United States. He returned to the UK in 1947, when he became a special organiser for Merseyside, then London District Secretary in 1948 and Mersey District Secretary in 1950. He was promoted to become National Organiser in 1955, and then elected as the union's treasurer and an assistant general secretary in 1959. While in the post, he ended a major unofficial strike, organised by the National Seamen's Reform Movement, by persuading North American maritime unions to stop funding the movement. He subsequently organised the expulsion of two NUS members, who he claimed were leaders of the movement. In 1960, Scott was elected as General Secretary of the NUS, beating William Sinclair, George Lipman and Thomas Sutton, and taking up the post at the start of the following year. Alongside leading the union, he was elected to serve on the General Council of the Trades Union Congress, the National Maritime Board, the Merchant Navy Welfare Board, the council of Ruskin College, and the executive of the International Transport Workers' Federation. As leader of the NUS, Scott began planning a reorganisation of the union, with the aim of reducing dissatisfaction among members about their lack of input into the union and its close co-operation with employers. However, he became ill, and Lipman had to take over his duties. Scott died early in 1962, just over a year after taking up office.
