In the United States, it is commonly used in the restaurant trade to refer to the meat of the squat lobster, which is neither a true lobster nor a prawn. Squat lobsters are more closely related to porcelain and hermit crabs. Crustaceans labeled as langostino are no more than long, and weigh no more than . Langostinos are not langoustes (spiny lobsters) despite a similar name (in Spanish, lobster is called '). Also, langostinos are sometimes confused with langoustines (Norway lobster). In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration allows \\"langostino\\" to be used as a market name for three species of squat lobster in the family Galatheidae: Cervimunida johni, Munida gregaria, and Pleuroncodes monodon. In Spain, it means some species of prawns. In Cuba and other Spanish-speaking Caribbean islands, the name langostino is also used to refer to crayfish. In Argentina the name is used to refer to Pleoticus muelleri, a kind of shrimp, while in Chile and Peru it refers to Pleuroncodes monodon.  Restaurant labeling controversies  In March 2006, Long John Silver's garnered controversy by offering a dish they called \\"Buttered Lobster Bites\\" without making it clear in its advertising that these were made from \\"langostino lobster.\\" The Federal Trade Commission ultimately launched an investigation into deceptive advertising practices by the chain, because Food and Drug Administration regulations require that anyone marketing langostino as lobster must place the qualifier \\"langostino\\" adjacent to the word \\"lobster,\\" and Long John Silver's not only failed to do this, but ran a television commercial making use of an American lobster in a manner that the Commission concluded was contributing to the misperception that the product was American lobster. Upon being contacted by the Commission, Long John Silver promptly terminated the television commercial campaigns, revised its website, and committed both to prominently placing the word \\"langostino\\" adjacent to the term \\"lobster\\" in all future advertising, and to revising its existing in-store materials accordingly within eight weeks, and on June 24, 2009, the Commission wrote to the chain to inform them that they had no intention of taking further action at that time. A Los Angeles Superior Court judge made no decisions in April 2006 on the matter when a class-action lawsuit was brought against Rubio's Restaurants, Inc., for selling \\"lobster burrito\\" and \\"lobster taco\\" that were in fact made with squat lobster. In February 2016, Red Lobster was revealed to have been substituting the less- expensive langostino for lobster.http://www.delish.com/food-news/a45936/cheap- fish-lobster-subsitute/ References External links * Category:Squat lobsters Category:Edible crustaceans ","title":"Langostino"},{"id":"4247411","text":"NICA is a particles accelerator complex being constructed by JINR near Moscow, Russia to perform experiments such as Nuclotron ion beams extracted to a fixed target and colliding beams of ions, ions-protons, polarized protons and deuterons. The projected maximal kinetic energy of the accelerated ions is 4.5 GeV, and 12.6 GeV for protons. NICA abbreviation stands for Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility.  NICA setup  NICA schematic layout Main elements of the NICA complex are: * Two-tier injection complex * Booster * Superconducting synchrotron Nuclotron * Collider facility * Multi-Purpose Detector (MPD) * Spin Physics Detector (SPD) * Beam transport channels. LU-20 injection device produces ions of 5 MeV/n energy. It is succeeded by three-staged Light Ion Linac (LILAc) that is capable of light particles acceleration up 7 MeV/n energy, 13 MeV proton acceleration section and a 20 MeV superconducting HWR proton accelerating section. Heavy-Ion Linac (HILAc) conceived in 2016 by the JINR-Bevatech collaboration accelerates heavy gold ions up to the energy of 3.2 MeV/n with beam intensity of 2*10^9 particles per pulse, and the repetition rate of 10 Hz. The gold ions are injected from JNIR-made KRION superconducting electron-string heavy ion source. The Booster, a superconducting synchrotron, accumulates, cools and further accelerates heavy ions to 600 MeV/n energy. The booster's circumference is 211 meters, its magnetic structure is mounted inside the yoke of the Nuclotron. The Booster is supposed to ensure ultrahigh vacuum of 10^11 Torr. The Nuclotron to be used in NICA was constructed in 1987‚Äì1992. It is the world's first synchrotron based on fast cycling electromagnets of the 'window frame' type with superconducting coil. The collider is made of two identical 503-meter long storage rings with MPD and SPD placed in the middle of the opposite straight sections. Magnetic rigidity is up to 45 Tm, residual gas pressure in the beam chamber is below 10^10 Torr, maximum field in the dipole magnets - 1.8 T, kinetic energy of gold nuclei - 1.0 to 4.5 GeV/n. The beams are combined and separated in the vertical plane. Upon passing the section bringing them together, the particle bunches in the upper and lower rings travel along a common straight trajectory toward each other to collide at MPD and SPD. Single-aperture lenses are installed along the final focus sections to provide that both beams are focused at SPD and MPD. MPD facility is designed to study hadron matter at high temperatures and densities, where nucleons \\"melt\\" releasing their constituent quarks and gluons and forming a new state, the quark-gluon plasma. SPD facility allows to collide the polarized beams of protons and deuterons to study the particle spin physics.  Construction  By 2013 an international tender for scientific equipment supply was completed selecting five core suppliers. Up to 2019 most of the equipment has been delivered and mounted. First tests began late 2019. The construction that was initially scheduled to end in 2016 is now (2020) to be accomplished by 2022.

Early life A second-generation Japanese American, Sabusawa was born to Harry and Riki Sabusawa and raised in Las Animas, Colorado. Her family moved to California after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Her family was then placed in an internment camp. After her family was interned in California, she was part of a relocation program for Japanese American students. She was designated to Antioch College in Ohio where she received her degree. After college, she translated Japanese propaganda for the US intelligence service before attending graduate school at the University of Chicago. Sabusawa was editor of the American Library Association's Bulletin in Chicago in 1954 when she met her husband. Activism Both Sabusawa and Michener were involved in the 1956 Hungarian Revolution against the USSR. Many Hungarians were killed, forcing many to flee. They made their home in Vienna a safe haven and helped many escape and make residence in the US. This would influence Michener's novel, The Bridge at Andau, 1957. She spoke out in support of American-Japanese marriages in the 1950s. Sabusawa urged her husband not to run for Congress as a Democrat in 1962. He did and lost and continued writing. She was encouraged and helped in the research of some of Michener's novels, such as, The Bridge at Andau, Hawaii, and The Source. Michener also wrote Centennial, written in 1974, which was later produced into a miniseries by the same name. It was filmed in part at Bent's Fort, close to Sabusawa's hometown of Las Animas, Colorado. Death Sabusawa died in Austin, Texas, on September 25, 1994. She left a bequest of $5 million to the University of Texas at Austin for the construction of what would become the Blanton Museum of Art in addition to the hundreds of paintings the couple gave the University during their lifetimes.

Maliana has seven villages consisting of Lahomea, Holsa, Ritabou, Odomau, Raifun, Tapo- Memo and Saburai. There are two main sources of water irrigation that supply water to paddy fields such Bulobu River,Nunura River, Malibaka and Bui Pira river. Bunak and Kemak are the native dialects of Maliana but most people understand and speak Tetum. Maliana had one of the preferred schools during Portuguese occupation, known as Collegio Infante sagres.

Corsaletti hit leadoff in the lineup hitting .357 with 4 home runs and 26 RBIs. Corsaletti spent the entire season with the Single-A+ Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Carolina League and was promoted to the Double-A Portland Sea Dogs for the season. During the 2007 season he was chosen as an Eastern League All-Star and was named the Allied Home Mortgage \\"Player of the Year\\" in Portland. Corsaletti started the season with the Portland Sea Dogs and was again named to the Eastern League All-Star team. Shortly thereafter he was promoted to the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox. Corsaletti was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 15, 2009 for a player to be named later or cash considerations.

The term, first used in A Thousand Plateaus (1980) where it was opposed to the rhizome, comes from the way genealogy trees are drawn: unidirectional progress, with no possible retroactivity and continuous binary cuts (thus enforcing a dualist metaphysical conception, criticized by Deleuze). Rhizomes, on the contrary, mark a horizontal and non- hierarchical conception, where anything may be linked to anything else, with no respect whatsoever for specific species: rhizomes are heterogeneous links between things that have nothing to do between themselves (for example, Deleuze and Guattari linked together desire and machines to create the - most surprising - concept of desiring machines). Horizontal gene transfer is also an example of rhizomes, opposed to the arborescent evolutionism theory. Deleuze also criticizes the Chomsky hierarchy of formal languages, which he considers a perfect example of arborescent dualistic theory. Deleuze, Gilles and Guattari, F√©lix. 1980.

Its catalogue contains books on history, politics, economics, art, religion, anthropology, biography, memoirs, children's literature, humor, cooking, popular science, self-help and popular psychology, and the complete works of various authors.  History  The company was founded in 1939 by Mariano Medina del R√≠o, shortly after his arrival from Spain, with the literary collaboration of √Ålvaro de las Casas, and the support of Medina's former classmate Carlos Braun Men√©ndez. Emec√©'s name is derived from the first letters of some of the founders' names (specifically, Mariano, Carlos, Medina, and Casas). In Spanish, M is pronounced \\"eme\\" and C \\"ce\\". During its early years, the company specialized in books about the region of Galicia, some written in the region's native language. In the subsequent decade, the company established its flagship series, \\"The Emec√© Library of Universal Works\\" (La Biblioteca Emec√© de Obras Universales). To this day, Emec√© precedes its works with an epigram from Miguel de Cervantes, to whom the series is dedicated: that books \\"are honest entertainment, delight with their language, and amaze and suspend [disbelief] with their invention.\\" (Spanish: \\"Sean de honesto entretenimiento, deleiten con el lenguaje y admiren y suspendan con la invenci√≥n.\\") Of the thousands of authors published by Emec√© during the six decades of its existence, two names stand out--Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry, creator and illustrator of The Little Prince, the most popular book published by Emec√©; and Jorge Luis Borges, arguably the most important Argentine author of the 20th century, whose work was edited and published by Emec√© for forty- five years. A group of distinguished collaborators edited several distinct collections at once. Eduardo Mallea created The Navy, The Chimera, and Great Essayists (El Nav√≠o, La Quimera y Grandes Ensayistas). Inspired by Borges and Adolfo Bioy Casares, Emec√© created The Seventh Circle (El S√©ptimo C√≠rculo), a collection of detective fiction which has grown to include 350 titles, including the major works of Raymond Chandler, James M. Cain, and James Hadley Chase. Where possible, Emec√© has attempted to include major works of artistic and cultural interest, ranging from Toynbee, Malraux, Matisse, Kandinsky, Francastel, and Huyghe to deluxe editions of Don Quixote. The house is known for its detailed coverage of Argentine topics, including Mart√≠n Fierro, the works of Bonifacio del Carril (in particular his Monumenta Iconogr√°fica), records of Argentina's Pre-Columbian inhabitants (such as the Inca and Diaguita), and the history of the gaucho. In 1948, beginning with the publication of The Ides of March by Thornton Wilder and The Stranger by Albert Camus, Emec√© established its \\"Great Novelists\\" collection, which continues to this day. Many celebrated writers, including Franz Kafka, William Faulkner, Alberto Moravia, Fran√ßois Mauriac, Camilo Jos√© Cela, Ernest Hemingway, Graham Greene, Vladimir Nabokov, Saul Bellow, Jorge Amado, Norman Mailer, Ray Bradbury, have been included in the collection. It has since widened its scope to include writers of popular fiction, such as Arthur Hailey, Erich Segal, Frederick Forsyth, Colleen McCullough, Stephen King, John le Carr√©, Leon Uris, Tom Clancy, Ken Follett, Arthur C. Clarke, Judith Krantz, Mary Higgins Clark, Scott Turow, Dean Koontz, Michael Crichton, Wilbur Smith, and Sidney Sheldon. However, Emec√© does not confine itself to works of fiction. It has published Papillon by Henri Charri√®re, Roots by Alex Haley, The Road Less Traveled by M. Scott Peck, as well as the works of Leo Buscaglia and Jaime Barylko. Emec√© is one of the largest publishers in Argentina. In 1989, Emec√© opened a publisher in Barcelona, Spain. In 2000, Emec√© Spain bought itself out and was renamed Ediciones Salamandra.https://elpais.com/diario/2000/10/10/cultura/971128811_850215.amp.html In May 2019, Salamandra was acquired by Penguin Random House.https://publishingperspectives.com/2019/05/penguin-random-house-grupo- edtorial-acquires-ediciones-salamandra  Imprints  Emece publishes books under the following collections: *Biblioteca Jorge Luis Borges *Biblioteca Adolfo Bioy Casares *Grandes Novelistas *Grandes Ensayistas *Biblioteca Breve *Formentor (Seix Barral) *Cruz del Sur *Lingua Franca  Emec√© Award  In 1954, the \\"Emec√© Literary Prize\\" (: Premio Emec√© Argentina) was created, and was the competition of its kind to be established in Argentina. To this day it remains a means for new authors to gain recognition. Quite a few literary figures achieved success as a result of winning the prize, including Beatriz Guido, Dalmiro Saenz, Griselda Gambaro, Mar√≠a Esther de Miguel, Mar√≠a Granata, and Ang√©lica Gorodischer. They, along with Bioy Casares, Ernesto Sabato, Eduardo Gudi√±o Kieffer, Isidoro Blaisten, Abelardo Castillo, Abel Posse, C√©sar Aira, and Margarita Aguirre, number among more than three hundred Argentine writers in the Emec√© catalogue.

Traditional Turkish archery has been inscribed on the Representative list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage of UNESCO in 2019. History Sultan 200px From the decline of military archery after the battle of Lepanto, mainly flight archery was practiced, and Turkish bowyers specialized in weapons which were particularly good for imparting high velocity to very light arrows. The sport of archery declined gradually until the reign of Mahmud II who made great efforts to revive it. He also ordered his archery student, Mustafa Kani, to write a book about the history, construction, and use of these bows, from which comes most of what is now known of Turkish bowyery.Paul E Klopsteg. Turkish Archery and the Composite Bow. Chapter I, Background of Turkish Archery. Second edition, revised, 1947, published by the author, 2424 Lincolnwood Drive, Evanston, Ill. In 1794, in a field outside London, the Turkish ambassador‚Äôs secretary used a Turkish bow and arrow to shoot 415 yards, partially against the wind, and 482 yards with the wind. He said on a plain near Constantinople pillars were located that commemorate distances of 800 yards achieved with Turkish bows and arrows in ancient times.The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol II, London, Charles Knight, 1847, p.16. After the death of Mahmud II in 1839, archery resumed its decline. The living art of Turkish bowyery was lost in the 1930s with the death of the last bowyer and famous calligrapher, Ne√ßmeddin Okyay; it has since been revived.Ottoman Turkish bows, manufacture and design. Adam Karpowicz (author and publisher). For many years the excellence of Turkish bows could be seen from historical records. In 1910 an archery contest was held on the beach at Le Touquet, France, where Ingo Simon was able to shoot an arrow 434 m using an old Turkish composite bow requiring a force of 440N or 99 lb.\\"Invention and Evolution\\" by M. J. French (1988, Cambridge Univ. Press) (chapter 3.4.2) Equipment Turkish Bow The Turkish bow is a recurved composite bow used in the Ottoman Empire. The construction is similar to that of other classic Asiatic composite bows, with a wooden core (maple was most desirable), animal horn on the belly (the side facing the archer), and sinew on the front, with the layers secured together with animal glue. However, several features of the Turkish bow are distinct. The curvature tends to be more extreme when the bow is unstrung, with the limbs curling forward into the shape of the letter \\"C\\". With some bows, the rigid tips of the limbs (\\"kasan\\") even touch. The grip area is not recessed like other Asianic bows and is fairly flat on the belly, while the front of the grip bulges outwards. The dramatic curvature of the bows makes stringing them very different from straighter bows found in Europe. There is an old saying in Turkey that there are \\"120 ways to string a bow,\\" though the most common methods involve sitting on ground with one's feet pressed against the grip. Heavier bows usually require the use of a long, looped strap to pull the limbs back and hold them while the string is seated. In the modern world, the Turkish bow is now predominantly used for sporting purposes. Authentic horn and sinew bow are still made but are both extremely costly and difficult to store outside certain environments and climates. For this reason, the majority of historically-styled bows of this type are made with some combination of fiberglass, hardwood (for the kasan) and resin, and with some being entirely resin. Zihgir Mehmed the Conqueror with a zihgir on his right hand Zihgir is the Turkish word for the thumb ring used to draw the bow in the Ottoman Empire. Turkish thumb rings were made of wood, metal, ivory, bone, horn or leather. These rings signified that the person wearing them was a warrior. In time they became a symbol of prestige in Ottoman society, and some later examples have so much ornamentation on the surface from which the bowstring slides that they could not be used to shoot with. Surviving examples are often made of precious metals and richly decorated. Some are carved from precious stones. Siper and Majra The siper and majra are devices used to draw arrows past the bow's front limb where the arrow would normally rest. The siper is a type of shelf strapped to the archer's bow hand, which allows the archer to use arrows several inches shorter(and therefore lighter) in order to get the maximum amount of force behind the arrow. They are most commonly used for Flight Archery, to achieve the greatest distance. The Majra is a thin piece of wood with a channel cut in it and small loop for the archer's draw hand. The device allows the archer to pull back arrows that are much shorter than were intended for the bow. There is some debate among historians if this device was designed to shoot arrows that were too short for the enemy to pick up and shoot back, or if it was a way to reuse bolts fired by Chinese crossbowmen. In modern times they are primarily used in Flight Archery to shoot shorter arrows to cut down on weight. Technique Like many other Eastern archery styles, Turkish archery uses a \\"thumb draw,\\" employing a type of grip called \\"mandal.\\" This grip prevents the arrow from moving if the archer is on a horse and/or firing at an unusual angle. The draw itself is relatively short, usually under the chin or by the cheek, compared to archery styles in China or Japan where the nock is pulled past the head. When the arrow is released, the draw arm is kept relatively steady rather than allowing the arm to swing backwards. Turkish archers developed several unique techniques to aid in combat. One was the practice of holding several arrows in between the fingers of the draw hand, allowing fast repeat shots. Another technique involved drawing the bow with the draw arm going behind the head to fire at a steep downward angle. This was used to fire from atop walls down at enemy troops.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPxPcvSjLJk\\" See also * Composite bow * Mongol bow * Gungdo *Mounted archery * Arab archery * Chinese archery *English Longbow External links * T√ºrk Ok√ßuluƒüu Aƒüƒ± (Turkish Archery Network) - in Turkish by Z.

Lacan‚Äôs practice, with his controversial innovation of variable-length sessions, and the critical stance he took towards much of the accepted orthodoxy of psychoanalytic theory and practice was a central stumbling-block to recognition of the new society.Roudinesco, p. 245-6 Eventually, in August 1963, a condition was set by the IPA that the registration of the SFP was dependent upon Lacan being removed from the list of training analysts with the organisation:, p79 as he himself put it, ‚Äúthis affiliation is to be accepted only if a guarantee is given that my teaching may never again be sanctioned by the Association as far as the training of analysts is concerned‚Äù.Lacan, The Four Fundamental Concepts p. 3 Lacan refused such a condition and left the SFP together with many of its members in June 1964 to set up the EFP independently of the IPA. The remaining membership of the SFP, including many of Lacan's own pupils such as Jean Laplanche, were to be recognised by the IPA the following year as part of a new body, the APF.Macey, p. xxxv Outcome Elisabeth Roudinesco concluded that ‚Äúthe 1963-4 break was as disastrous for the IPA as it was for the development of Lacanianism‚Äù.Roudinesco, p. 259 See also References External links * SFP Category:Jacques Lacan Category:Organizations established in 1953 Category:Freudian psychology Category:History of psychiatry Category:1953 establishments in France Category:1965 disestablishments in France Category:Organizations disestablished in 1965 Category:Psychoanalysis ","title":"Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise de Psychanalyse"},{"id":"4247692","title":"Accommodation of Crews Convention (Revised), 1949"},{"id":"4247697","text":"The √âcole freudienne de Paris (EFP) was a French psychoanalytic professional body formed in 1964 by Jacques Lacan. It became 'a vital‚Äîif conflict- ridden‚Äîinstitution until its dissolution in 1980'.David Macey, \\"Introduction\\", Jacques Lacan, The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis (Penguin 1994) p. xiii Early history In 1953 conflict within the Paris psychoanalytical society had reached such a pitch that \\"a group of senior figures, including but not led by Lacan, broke away to form the Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise de Psychanalyse (SFP)\\".Macey, p. xii The latter's long quest for recognition from the IPA finally stalled in 1963: \\"it emerged again and again that Lacan's 'variable sessions' were the contentious issue\\" and in the end \\"the price of recognition was the final and definitive exclusion of Lacan from the training programme\\".Macey, xiii As a result of the International Psychoanalytical Association (IPA) demand to remove Lacan from the list of training analysts with the organisation , p79; reprinted in Lacan, Jacques, Television/A Challenge to the Psychoanalytic Establishment, (1990) p79. Lacan left the SFP, which was dissolved the following year: \\"Half its assets went to the EFP, and half to a new Association Psychoanalytique de France...[which] was recognised by the IPA\\".Macey, p. xxxv Lacan's \\"Founding Act\\" In June 1964 Lacan published the \\"Founding Act\\", p96 to establish his own school, which became known as the √âcole Freudienne de Paris (EFP). Grandly proclaiming that \\"a labor is to be accomplished‚Äîa labor which, in the field opened up by Freud, restores the cutting edge of his discovery...[&] denounces the deviations and compromises that blunt its program\\", \\"Founding Act\\", in Jacques Lacan, Television (London 1990) p. 97 the Founding Act sought from the start to claim the moral high-ground in opposition to the IPA. On the vexed question of training, the Act proclaimed that \\"a psychoanalyst is a trainer, for having conducted one or several analyses which proved to be of a didactic nature. Such empowerment is de facto\\".Television, p. 100 Disputes and the \\"Pass\\" The conjoined issues of authority and of training analyses, which had led to the foundation of the EFP, plagued its history from the very start. In December, 1965, Francois Perrier resigned from the Board over the question of training, writing to Lacan that 'What we expect of you is serene authority...not reckless skirmishes that might be the work of ex-guerrillas turned desperadoes...you always divide but never rule'.Quoted in Elisabeth Roudinesco, Jacques Lacan (Cambridge 1997) p. 318 In 1967, Lacan proposed the notion of \\"the Pass\\" in the hope of providing an answer to the question of accreditation; but the following year, in 1968, Perrier and two other former board members, with some twenty other members disputing as a group the EFP's accreditation process, broke away to form the Organisation psychanalytique de langue fran√ßaise, also known as the \\"Quatri√®me groupe\\".Jacques Sedat, Ecole Freudienne de Paris 'The issue of the pass continues to devastate the Lacanian community to this very day [2005]‚Äîmore than two decades after Lacan dissolved his school'.Dany Nobus/Malcolm Quinn, Knowing Nothing, Staying Stupid (2005) p. 97 The pass was essentially a procedure whereby ananalysand could give an account of his or her inward transformation before three \\"passeurs\\", who would then validate the transformation from analysand to analyst. Lacan was deeply committed to the 'proposition that the analyst hystorizes only from himself: a patent fact. even if he is confirmed in doing so by a hierarchy'.\\"Preface\\" [1976], Lacan, Four Fundamental Concepts, p. xl That was the basis for his moral authority with respect to the IPA; but 'the form of charismatic authority which, in his personal and institutional presence, he so dramatically provoked'Jacqueline Rose, On Not Being Able To Sleep (London 2003) p. 176 could scarcely be generalised to every member of the school without producing a Pirandello world of Right You Are! (if you think so). Seen from outside, 'Lacan's failed attempt to institutionalise awareness without institutionalising it, is fascinating', but fell down on the aporia that 'the passe which changed the analyst was a passage from one inner state to another, while the passe which recognised the new status was a formalised external procedure'.Michael Parsons, The Dove that Returns, the Dove that Vanishes (London 2000) p. 72-3 From the inside, 'animosity and resentment...[&] suspicion of institutional foul play'Nobus/Quinn, p. 97 were the Lacanian legacy of the pass. Dogmatism and dissolution In the wake of the '68 split, 'an increasingly rigid Lacanian orthodoxy'Rose, p. 182 came to dominate the EFP: as a disillusioned former member remarked, the custom of closing debates or silencing objections with a quotation from a Lacan who had become the object of a personality cult was scarcely conducive to open debate'.Macey, p. xxxiii Perhaps as a result, in January 1980 Lacan announced the dissolution of the EFP., p128-130; reprinted in Lacan, Jacques, Television/A Challenge to the Psychoanalytic Establishment, (1990) p128-130. in order to forestall 'the degradation of his ideas under the weight of his own institution...a challenge to authority yet at the same time authoritarian....Lacan was trapped in the circles of this paradox'.Juliet Mitchell and Jacqueline Rose, Feminine Sexuality (New York 1982) p. vii He then founded another short-lived organisation, La cause freudienne; but 'more than twenty associations emerged from the 1980 dissolution of the Ecole freudienne de Paris'Jacques Sedat, \\"French Lacanian Movement\\"‚Äîtestimony perhaps to the way 'the Lacanian movement was doomed to dissidence...the history of a perpetual acting-out, the momentary adventure, a kind of surrealist time'.Roudinesco, p. 432 However La Cause freudienne kept alive the Lacanian legacy with its Lettre Mensuelle (edited by Jacques-Alain Miller and G√©rard Pommier): at its masthead, a quote from Joyce's Finnegans Wake, \\"Here comes Everybody...seeker of the nest of evil in the bosom of a good word.\\" References Category:Jacques Lacan Category:1964 establishments in France Category:Educational institutions established in 1964 Category:Medical and health organizations based in France Category:Psychoanalysis ","title":"√âcole Freudienne de Paris"},{"id":"4247698","text":"3D Fax was a computer program for file transfer via fax.

The device consists of a controller box, a cooling stage, and a sample holder. Additionally, various microliter syringes, immersion oils and microscopes are required for its use. Cooling of the stage is achieved with the use of Peltier devices inside the cooling stage. The Clifton nanolitre osmometer is especially well suited for determining the antifreeze activity or thermal hysteresis of a solution, which is a difference in the melting and freezing point of a solution. This phenomenon arises when biological antifreeze proteins are present in a solution. Solutions that do not contain antifreeze proteins generally have identical freezing and melting points. Operation The cooling stage The sample holder with 7 \\"wells\\" The Clifton controls and readout A melting and freezing point determination consists of the following steps: # Calibration: The device should be calibrated with solutions of known osmolarity, typically a 2-point calibration is used. # Loading: Each of the wells in the sample holder are filled with a \\"heavy\\" immersion oil. A small amount (generally 1-2nL) of solution is pipetted or blown into the oil in the wells using a microliter syringe or a pulled capillary tube. # Deep Freeze: The stage is cooled to a temperature of around -40 degrees Celsius (-40 ¬∞F) very quickly (~20 seconds), which causes the samples in the sample wells to flash-freeze. # Determinations: The samples are allowed to melt relatively slowly, under the control of the osmometer controller. The temperature of the sample (solution) at the point when the last ice crystal disappears is called the melting point. The samples are refrozen using the deep freeze, and once again melted towards a single ice crystal. When only a single, very small ice crystal remains the samples are cooled in a controlled manner using the nanoliter control box. The temperature of the solution at the point when the ice crystal grows is called the freezing point. Uses for the Clifton nanolitre osmometer A scientist using the Clifton It can be used to determine the osmolarity (saltiness) of very small volumes of aqueous solutions such as tears, biological samples or plant fluids. It can also be used to determine the antifreeze activity or thermal hysteresis in a solution, such as fluids from polar fish, overwintering insects, cold-hardy plants, any fluid that contains antifreeze proteins.

Population: 53,000 (1969); 34,000 (1939).

History The selo of Alexandrovskoye () was founded in 1860 by the settlersPospelov, p. 25 from the European part of Russia. In 1893, the selo of Bochkaryovka () appeared nearby. The two localities grew with the construction of a station on the Trans-Siberian Railway in 1913, and by 1923 Alexandrovskoye and Bochkarevka merged and were transformed into Alexandrovsk (). Town status was granted to Alexandrovsk in 1926. In 1931, it was renamed Krasnopartizansk (), then, in 1935, Kuybyshevka- Vostochnaya (), to commemorate the Soviet statesman Valerian Kuybyshev. In 1957, possibly to reduce the number of localities named after Kuybyshev, the town was given its present name. While the literal meaning of the name is white mountains, the reasons for renaming are unclear, as the town stands on a plain with no \\"white mountains\\" anywhere in the vicinity. It is possible, however, that the name was due to the whitish color of the quartz sands of the bluffs on the Tom River, or that it was allegorical, with the meaning of a white town. Climate Belogorsk saw a record high temperature for Asian Russia at on 25 June 2010. This record was beaten two days later in Ust-Karsk. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Belogorsk serves as the administrative center of Belogorsky District,Law #419-OZ even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is, together with one rural locality (the selo of Nizinnoye), incorporated separately as Belogorsk Urban Okrug‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Law #127-OZ As a municipal division, this administrative unit also has urban okrug status.Law #423-OZ Economy Belogorsk is a center for food production, as well as construction products.

It features modular design and employs rockets with calibers ranging from 127 mm to 450 mm ( 5-17.72 inches). It was developed on the basis of a Tectran VBT-2028 6√ó6 all- terrain vehicle for enhanced mobility. Overview Tectran AV-UCF fire control vehicle Astros II are normally grouped in artillery batteries consisting on average of about 13 vehicles: 6 of them are Astros II launchers, 6 are rocket resupply trucks and 1 a special radar-equipped vehicle controlling the fire-control system. The launcher is capable of firing rockets of different calibres armed with a range of warheads. Each rocket resupply truck carries up to two complete reloads. Service history The ASTROS II artillery system entered service with the Brazilian Army in 1983. The system is battle proven, having been used in action by the Iraqi Army in the Gulf Wars. In the 1980s, Avibr√°s sold an estimated 66 Astros II artillery systems to Iraq. Iraq also built the Sajeel-60 which is a license-built version of the Brazilian SS-60. Sixty Astros II were sold to Saudi Arabia and an unspecified number sold to Bahrain and Qatar. Total sales of the Astros II between 1982 and 1987 reached US$1 billion. This fact made the Astros II multiple rocket launcher the most profitable weapon produced by Avibr√°s. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Avibr√°s worked almost exclusively with the manufacturing of rockets and multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS), such as the Astros II, in addition to developing antitank and antiship missiles. At its peak, Avibr√°s employed 6,000 people; later it would be reduced to 900 people in the early 1990s as the arms industry demand fell. Even so, in the first Gulf War in 1991, the Astros II was successfully used by Saudi Arabia against Iraq. Years earlier, the Astros II system helped Angola to defeat the UNITA. New generation The next step is an ambitious program, the Astros 2020 (Mk6), based on a 6x6 wheeled chassis. Being a new concept, it will require an estimated investment of R$1.2 billion, of which about US$210 million will be invested solely in development. It will be integrated with the cruise missile AVMT-300 with 300-km range during the stage of testing and certification. It is said that the venture will, for example, enable the Army to integrate the Astros with defense anti-aircraft guns, paving the way for the utilization of common platforms, trucks, parts of electronic sensors and command vehicles. The Astros 2020 will also be equipped with a 180 mm GPS-guided rocket called the SS-AV-40 with a range of 40 rockets carried and SS-150 newly developed rockets with a claimed maximum range of 150 km. Four of them are carried. 36 Astros 2020 systems are to be acquired.Brazilian army will continue to upgrade Astros rocket launchers ‚Äì Armyrecognition.com, December 29, 2012 Variants SS-30, SS-40, SS-60 and an Astros MK6 the Brazilian Army. * SS-30 ‚Äì fires 127 mm rockets ‚Äì Loads 32 * SS-40 ‚Äì fires 180 mm rockets ‚Äì Loads 16 * SS-AV-40 ‚Äì fires 180 mm rockets ‚Äì Loads 40 * SS-60 ‚Äì fires 300 mm rockets ‚Äì Loads 4 * SS-80 ‚Äì fires 300 mm rockets ‚Äì Loads 4 * SS-150 ‚Äì fires 450 mm rockets ‚Äì Loads 4 * FOG MPM - Anti-tank, anti-fortification and anti-helicopter missile * AV- TM 300 ‚Äì Cruise Missile - Loads 2 Specifications Astros MK6 inside.

Population: History Before the exploration expeditions of the Russian Cossacks in the 17th century, the future Petrovsk-Zabaykalsky's location was a route junction of nomadic Buryat tribes. Peter the Great granted the heads of the tribes with principality. The settlement, founded in 1789 and known then as Petrovsky Zavod (), grew and developed around its iron refinery. From 1830 to 1839, it was a detention place for seventy-one Decembrists and ten of their wives, who were sent here from Chita. There is a commemorating mark on the railway station. In a restored house of the princess Ekaterina Troubetskaya, wife of Sergey Trubetskoy, was organized a museum, which opened on October 10, 1980. In Petrovsk-Zabaykalsky's historical district there are several buildings related to the times of Decembrists in the town. In 1926, the settlement was granted town status and given its present name.

It is owned and operated by iHeartMedia, and is broadcasting a Mainstream Adult Contemporary format. The station's studios are located along Dallas Parkway in Farmers Branch, Texas (although it has a Dallas address). The transmitter site is off West Belt Line Road in Cedar Hill. History Easy Listening format 102.1 FM was authorized by the Federal Communications Commission in 1960 to broadcast as KFMF, but the station was not immediately built. KJIM AM 870 (now KFJZ) purchased the KFMF construction permit and it signed on the air on April 10, 1962 as KJIM- FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-204 At first, KJIM-FM simulcast the daytime-only AM sister station, to allow programming to be heard after sunset. Later, KJIM-FM switched to an automated easy listening instrumental format. KJIM-AM-FM acquired a UHF-TV permit in the mid-1960s to construct Channel 21 (today KTXA). The company sold off AM 870 to raise capital. Move to Album Rock In 1966, KJIM-FM changed their call letters to KFWT-FM and improved its signal, going from 2900 watts at 165 feet to 100,000 watts at 1,000 feet HAAT from the antenna tower that would also transmit Channel 21. (Channel 21 went on the air in 1967 and signed off in 1970, returning under new ownership in 1980.) KFWT-FM was sold to Marsh Media of Amarillo, Texas and subsequently changed its call letters to KFWD. In 1973, the station flipped to album rock, and was bought by the Southern Media Company in 1975. Switch to Q102 In October 1978, Program Director Steve Sutton changed the call sign to KTXQ and the branding to \\"Q102\\" (to launder the station of a Fort Worth image, and to lessen confusion with then-CBS network affiliate KDFW-TV Channel 4). In 1983, CBS Radio bought the station. Through the 1980s and 1990s, the station aired variations on the rock format, including classic rock and mainstream rock. Morning hosts Bo and Jim were popular Q102 DJs for most of Q102's existence. Though KTXQ maintained high ratings for years, by the mid-1990s, the station fell into a steep decline, particularly after the debut of KRRW's similar- sounding classic rock format. In its final book in the summer of 1998, KTXQ was ranked 19th with a 2.4 share of the market. In early 1997, CBS sold the station to New York-based SFX Broadcasting. By August of that year, however, Austin-based Capstar merged with SFX. Six months later, locally-based Chancellor Media acquired KTXQ through a series of trades with Capstar. Magic 102 At Noon on August 27, 1998, on the same day that Chancellor announced that they would merge with Capstar to form AMFM, Inc., KTXQ discontinued its long-running rock format and began stunting with simulcasts of other AMFM stations from across the country (including KYLD, WHTZ, KYSR, and WUBE-FM), as well as redirecting listeners to KZPS. On August 31, at 3 p.m., KTXQ flipped to rhythmic oldies as \\"Magic 102.\\" The first song on \\"Magic\\" was \\"Shotgun\\" by Jr. Walker & the All Stars.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1998/RR-1998-09-04.pdfhttp://www.dallasobserver.com/music/souled- out-6401763 102.1 The Edge In 2000, as a condition of Clear Channel's purchase of AMFM, sister station 94.5 FM, along with the intellectual property of Magic 102, were sold to Radio One. When Radio One moved the rhythmic oldies format to 94.5 at 6 a.m. on November 9, 2000, Clear Channel moved 94.5's alternative rock format to 102.1 as KDGE, \\"102.1 the Edge.\\" =KDGE history= Created by Founder and original owner Steve Allison in 1989 (Allison Broadcast Group, Inc.), the EDGE was basically an evolution of Allison's Phoenix radio station, KEYX \\"KEY 100.3\\" an alternative station which he founded in 1986. Allison bought then KZRK for $3.6 million cash. KZRK programmed the syndicated heavy metal format ZRock. Soon after debuting KDGE, Allison then immediately took on the construction of a 2,000-foot tower in Collinsville, Texas in order to improve the station's signal. Steve Allison chose the name \\"The EDGE\\" and changed the call letters to KDGE. He also designed the station's logo and chose and developed its format. Larry Neilson, the former program director of KEYX in Phoenix was chosen as the original EDGE Program Director. Wendy Naylor, who had worked for Allison at his various stations in Phoenix since 1982, was chosen as the Music Director and morning show co-host along with KEYX alumni Roger King. Also relocating to Dallas from Phoenix was Tom Duran as the Sales Manager and a major player in helping create The EDGE's promotion and concerts. Months before The EDGE debut in June 1989, the KEYX Phoenix crew was formulating the station's format, promotions, etc. from a temporary suite while the EDGE studios were being built out next door. Two weeks before the EDGE debut, Program Director Larry Neilson was contacted by Dallas local George Gimarc about possibly doing a speciality show on The EDGE. Neilson was impressed by Gimarc's music knowledge, consulted with Owner/General Manager Steve Allison, and made the decision to put Gimarc on as the afternoon drive air personality. Gimarc proved to be a good hire and his influence on the station over time was invaluable, but he had nothing whatsoever to do with the \\"founding\\" of \\"The Edge\\". \\"The Edge\\" became an important force in the local music scene in Dallas, is the only station to play local and national \\"alternative\\" styles. (KEGL had switched to a more modern format around 1982 but by 1989, that station was largely playing hits from national playlists.) Coinciding with the KDGE start-up, Steve Allison and Tom Duran formed a separate event promotion company called \\"Cutting Edge Events\\", which was the promotion force behind the station. They along with the station's Promotion Director, Tara Allison (Steve Allison's wife) created unusual events and promotions from 1989 through 1992. A collaborative effort by the Allisons, Duran, Neilson, Wendy Naylor and George Gimarc was the driving force in making The Edge a player in the Dallas market. From \\"Take the Edge on Vacation,\\" to \\"Dinner on the Mayflower,\\" the group kept the Edge on the cutting force of promotions in Dallas. Important contributions were made by Gimarc, Naylor, and almost all staff members. Gimarc also assembled a series of 11 compilation CDs of local bands under the name Tales from the Edge. Released between 1990 and 1996, each CD featured between 15 and 20 bands, mostly from Dallas, Austin and Denton. The CDs were value-priced: the first four include the prominent slogan \\"Still Only $2.94!\\" (sponsorships and advertising paid for the bulk of production). Several later issues were double-CD compilations, with one CD featuring current local bands, and the other being more specialized, including one focused on the area's earliest punk bands, including tracks by The Nervebreakers, The Telefones, Stickmen With Rayguns, and The Hugh Beaumont Experience, while another, put together by DJ Jeff K, featuring the (then-)newer styles of dance-club music including techno, trance and electropop (a direction the station was increasingly taking in 1994-95, after the departure of Gimarc, and with the increasing prominence of Jeff K). Notable artists featured on the CDs early in their careers included Course of Empire, Horton Heat, Deep Blue Something, Tripping Daisy, Sister 7 (as \\"Little Sister\\"), and Poi Dog Pondering. All told, over 100,000 CDs were sold in the series. The station featured an annual music festival called Edgefest once a year, plus an annual EDGE B-Day party concert and party. Past Edgefest acts included Pearl Jam, The Charlatans, Sugarcubes, Tripping Daisy, Seether, The Origin, Nickelback, Staind, My Chemical Romance, Muse, The Killers, Placebo, Kaiser Chiefs, Weezer, The Toadies, Blue October, INXS, Beck, Social Distortion, Everclear, Sponge, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Default, KoRn, Deftones, Hole, Phoenix, The Black Keys, Cage the Elephant, Cake, Flogging Molly and Drowning Pool. The first Edgefest was documented in the Jerry Lentz film \\"Angry Blue Planet.\\" There were also seven editions of The Edge Home Movie, a free rental - full hour of music videos hosted by Edge DJs. One was filmed at Edgefest in 1994, and another at Lollapalooza that same year. Other notable jocks during this time include Alex Luke, Brian the Butler, Jerry Lentz, Roger King, Ernie Mills, Jeff K, Josh Venable, DJ Merritt, and Valerie Knight. In 1994, Steve Allison sold KDGE for $16 million to the broadcast-arm of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which also owned classic rock station KZPS. After that ownership change, Gimarc, Naylor, and the entire Phoenix contingent were shown the door and the station changed direction dramatically, now being \\"corporate\\" programmed. A year later, Clear Channel Communications bought all of the Mormon broadcasting company's stations nationally. Clear Channel later changed their name to IHeart Radio. The station's 'unofficial' 20th Anniversary party was on July 3, 2009, at the Lakewood Theatre with performances from Zac Malloy of the Nixons, John Easdale of Dramarama, Deep Blue Something, Pop Poppins, and the Bat Mastersons. Former 102.1 The Edge ident used until November 16, 2016. Specialty programming included the Saturday night electronic/dance music show called \\"Edgeclub\\" with DJ Merritt (nation's longest-running and highest-rated mixshow), and Sunday shows \\"The Old School Edge\\" with Jeff K, \\"The Adventure Club\\" with Josh, and \\"The Local Show\\" with Mark, which features music made in the Dallas/Ft. Worth Metroplex. Edgeclub was taken off the air in 2010. Josh Venable became the Program Director in 2011. In January 2013, KDGE was briefly re-branded as \\"102-1 KDGE\\"; it later returned to the \\"Edge\\" ident. Star 102.1 Logo for \\"Star\\" used during November/December 2016; alternate version is red and green, with a Santa hat over the S. On November 16, 2016, at 3 p.m., after playing \\"Out of My League\\" by Fitz & the Tantrums, KDGE began stunting with a continuous loop of \\"Closing Time\\" by Semisonic (for the first few hours, it was interspersed with \\"It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\\" by R.E.M.), while redirecting Edge listeners to KEGL and that a new format would debut the following day at 5 p.m. on KDGE. KDGE Dallas Drops Alternative After 27 Years; Flips to Mainstream AC as \\"Star 102.1\\"102.1 The Edge Signs Off At that time, the station shifted the stunting to Christmas music with the new branding of \\"Star 102.1.\\" The first song played under the Christmas music stunting was \\"Last Christmas\\" by Wham!.Star 102.1 Debuts At Midnight on December 26, after playing \\"Same Old Lang Syne\\" by Dan Fogelberg, KDGE officially debuted their permanent Mainstream Adult Contemporary format (under the \\"Star\\" branding), with \\"Lucky Star\\" by Madonna as the first song played. The flip brought the format back to the Dallas-Fort Worth media market for the first time since 2014, when former longtime AC station KVIL evolved to Hot AC, and then to Top 40/CHR. KVIL has since flipped to Alternative as \\"Alt 103.7\\", picking up the same format one year after KDGE dropped the format. KDGE-HD2 102.1 HD-2 originally broadcast \\"The Cutting Edge,\\" a version of the station's alternative rock format with reduced commercials and some tracks never before played on the radio. In July 2012, KDGE-HD2 switched formats and began airing a Classic Alternative format, renamed as \\"Old School Edge\\", with the playlist leaning toward adult alternative. In October 2013, it flipped to airing recent episodes of \\"Sixx Sense with Nikki Sixx\\" in addition to a mainstream rock format via iHeartRadio until the show's end. On February 1, 2018, it simulcast iHeartRadio's \\"Rock Workout\\" station, with an upbeat Mainstream Rock format.http://hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=5 HD Radio Guide for Dallas-Ft.

Early life and education From an early age, Lavery was obsessed with space exploration. With his eyesight being too poor to become an astronaut, he set about to use machines as his proxy for exploring the solar system. He attended Virginia Tech, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Career Lavery led NASA's Telerobotics Technology Development Program, responsible for the direction and oversight of robotics and planetary exploration within the organization. He and the program was responsible for the likes of the Mars Sojourner rover, which was the first rover he worked on, and the National Robotics Engineering Consortium. Lavery currently works at the NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC, as the Program Executive for Solar System Explorations. He oversees and is heavily involved with the Mars Exploration Rovers. Notably, he oversaw the mission of the Curiosity rover in 2012. Lavery is also the project manager for NASAs' Robotics Alliance Project a position he shares with fellow NASA scientist and FIRST Robotics participant Mark Leon. FIRST Robotics Lavery is very active within the FIRST Robotics Competition, and currently sits on the Executive Advisory Board of FIRST.

Lemaire, Jacques Lacan (1979) p. 165 The concept of demand was developed by Lacan in parallel to those of need and desire to account for the role of speech on human aspirations.Gabriel Balbo, \\"Demand\\" Demand forms part of Lacan's battle against the approach to language acquisition favored by ego psychology, and makes use of Kojeve's theory of desire.David Macey, \\"Introduction\\", Jacques Lacan, The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis (London 1994) p. xxviii Demand is not a Freudian concept. Language acquisition For Lacan, demand is the result of language acquisition on physical needs ‚Äì the individual's wants are automatically filtered through the alien system of external signifiers.Alan Sheridan, \\"Translator's Note\\", Lacan, Four p. 278 Where traditionally psychoanalysis had recognised that learning to speak was a major step in the ego's acquisition of power over the world,Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (London 1946) p. 46 and celebrated its capacity for increasing instinctual control,Selma H. Fraiberg, The Magic Years (New York 1987) p. 133-4 and p. 115 Lacan by contrast stressed the more sinister side of man's early submergence in language. He argued that \\"demand constitutes the Other as already possessing the 'privilege' of satisfying needs\\", and that indeed the child's biological needs are themselves altered by \\"the condition that is imposed on him by the existence of the discourse, to make his need pass through the defiles of the signifier\\".Jacques Lacan, Ecrits: A Selection (London 1997) p. 286 and p. 264 Thus even in speaking one's demands, the latter are altered; and even when they are met, the child finds that it no longer wants what it thought it wanted.Stuart Schneiderman, Returning to Freud (New York 1980) p. 5 Desire In Lacanian thought, a demand results when a lack in the Real is transformed into the Symbolic medium of language. Demands faithfully express unconscious signifying formations, but always leave behind a residue or kernel of desire, representing a lost surplus of jouissance for the subject, (because the Real is never totally symbolizable). As a result, for Lacan, \\"desire is situated in dependence on demand ‚Äì which, by being articulated in signifiers, leaves a metonymic remainder which runs under it\\".Lacan, Four p. 154 The frustration inherent in demand ‚Äì whatever is actually asked for is 'not it' ‚Äì is what gives rise to desire.Philip Hill, Lacan for Beginners (London 1997) p. 66 The Other's demands The demands of human society are initially mediated via the Mother;Lacan, Ecrits p. 321 with the discourse of whom the infant comes to identify, subsuming its own non-verbal self-expression.Gabriel Balbo \\"Demand\\" The result in the neurotic may be a dominance of parental demand, and of the social objects valued by such demands ‚Äì jobs, degrees, marriage, success, money and the like.Bruce Fink, The Lacanian Subject (Princeton 1997) p. 189 and p. 87 Lacan considered indeed that for the neurotic \\"the demand of the Other assumes the function of an object in his phantasy...this prevalence given by the neurotic to demand\\". Transference Lacan considered that the transference appears in the forms of demands from the patientLacan, Four p. 235 ‚Äì demands which he stressed the analyst must resist.Lacan, Ecrits p. 276 Through such demands, he states, \\"the whole past opens up right down to early infancy. The subject has never done anything other than demand, he could not have survived otherwise, and...regression shows nothing other than a return to the present of signifiers used in demands\\".Lacan, Ecrits p. 254-5 Fran√ßois Roustang however has challenged the Lacanian view, arguing that the patient's demand, rather than undermining the analysis, may be a positive attempt to get the analyst to shift their therapeutic stance.Jan Campbell, Psychoanalysis and the Time of Life (2006) p. 84 See also References Category:Psychoanalytic terminology Category:Jacques Lacan Category:Post- structuralism Category:Structuralism ","title":"Demand (psychoanalysis)"},{"id":"4248152","text":"The following lists events that happened during 1911 in New Zealand.

The 1911 General Election, the first contested by the Reform Party, left parliament in an indeterminate state, with Reform holding 38 seats, Liberal 36, Labour 1 and with 5 independents. Liberal, who had been in government for the past 21 years, claimed that Reform did not have a mandate, since many of their seats were the smaller rural electorates, and the Liberals proceeded to form a government under Joseph Ward as per the previous two parliaments. Such were the loyalties of the independent members that votes were often deadlocked and dependent upon the casting vote of the Speaker.

The book was published by Puffin Books Australia in 1993, The Gathering has sold over 70 000 copies in Australia and New Zealand alone. The book was a joint recipient of the 1993 Children's Peace Literature Award and was also named Book of the Year in 1994 by the Children's Book Council of Australia. In 1994, the novel was also integrated into the literature curriculum for the junior years of Secondary Education in the Australian state of Victoria. Plot summary The novel is narrated by Nathanial Delaney, a teenage boy with a self-confessed Hamlet complex and social ineptitude, which can be credited to his lack of a stable environment; he and his mother have been moving frequently since the divorce of his parents. Their most recent home is the seaside town of Cheshunt, an apparently quiet community that Nathanial immediately dislikes, citing the town's bitter wind and abattoir stench as the primary reasons. His resentment causes tension between him and his mother, and their relationship becomes more strained as the story goes on. Many themes are portrayed in this novel including good vs evil, inner struggle, human nature, conformity vs individuality, friendship and cooperation. Nathanial soon discovers that there is more to dislike about the town than the smell. The school, Three North High, is victimised by its brutish student patrol, which is under the orders of the vice principal. Mr Karle \\"invites\\" Nathanial to join the school's youth group, The Gathering. He believes strongly in cooperation, and hence does not encourage individualism. Nathanial declines to join The Gathering, which becomes an issue with the school patrol. While walking his dog one night, Nathanial accidentally stumbles on a meeting of a group of three students from Three North: Danny Odin, Indian Mahoney and Nissa Jerome. A fourth member is not present, a school prefect, Seth Paul. The group are known as The Chain, and they tell Nathanial they have been brought together by the \\"forces of light\\" to fight a deep evil in Cheshunt, an evil headed by Mr Karle (whom they refer to as \\"The Kraken\\"). When Nathanial is caught and questioned by The Chain, they are all informed by the group's prophetic guide, Lallie, that Nathanial is the final of the chosen members of their clan and his arrival heralds the beginning of their battle. Throughout the novel Nathanial overcomes his cynicism and begins seeing signs of The Dark everywhere, most centrally in the past; in studying the history of Cheshunt he uncovers many parallels between his situation and past events. Throughout the story he also gradually learns that each of his fellow members have deep personal demons, and his role in The Chain and the Binding of the Dark becomes clear in the final chapters, where the grand showdown between The Dark and The Light takes place. Major themes Good versus evil The most obvious theme of the novel, as cited by readers and critics, is that of good versus evil. The issue is dealt with by examining the concept of evil as a malevolent force existing outside of human action from the view point of a character largely defined by logic and rationality. Such an approach creates an air of realism in what is essentially a fantastical plot. The questioning nature of the protagonist (Nathanial), coupled with the story's revelations about the pasts of the town and of the other central characters, also help steer the novel clear of simplistic notions and raise more philosophical questions about the nature of humankind. Depiction of evil It is concluded by the novel's end that the town of Cheshunt was not only a place that harboured \\"evil\\" as a force, but had been \\"scarred\\" by evil as a choice and consequence of mankind, perpetuating a sort of vicious circle. This theory extends the fundamental theme of Good Vs Evil beyond both the concept of Good and Evil as two separate, mutually exclusive forces of life and the more humanistic concept of both good and evil as components of human nature by incorporating these two ideas into one. It is perhaps this device that contributed to the books popularity amongst children, as it depicts the world with both childlike simplicity and mature, analytical complexity. It is suggested within this book that evil, like history, has a habit of repeating itself. This is shown through the evil that once grew in Cheshunt many years ago, when the town's old caretaker died (a significant plot point). The presence of Lallie, who seems to be some kind of spiritual being rather than a physical person, hints that it is recognized by some kind of greater consciousness that evil will repeat itself and something terrible will happen again. Existentialism Definition: a philosophical theory emphasizing the existence of the individual as a free and responsible agent determining his or her own development. A thematically significant point of the story development takes place in Chapter 16, when Nathanial learns that Danny, a member of The Chain, was a victim of police brutality many years ago. Later the saying \\"Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely\\" is aptly used in reference to the story, which involved police officers letting savage dogs loose on Danny to force him to give them information that was false. His story's conclusion and climax had one of the police officers that had attacked him visit Danny's school for a talk to improve citizen-authority relations, at the end of which the officer gave Danny a wink: > When he winked, it all came clear to me. I realised everything that happened > was a joke. I had been thinking that what happened with the police was > wrong, waiting for something to happen to make it right. But when he winked, > I realised nothing was going to make it right. That's life. Nothing made > sense but to stay alive ‚Äì survive. Justice. Right and wrong, it was all > bullshit that people made up. \\\\- (page 122) This quote and the opinion expressed in it is somewhat jarring with the rest of the novel's message, as it flatly denies the existence of both good and evil, crediting them to existential inventions of mankind to put order in the world. This reflects the philosophical belief known as nihilism. At the same time, it shows an acknowledgement on Carmody's part of philosophies outside of the key one that the story presents. The theory is, however, later rebuffed by the very same character that put it forward, as it doesn't make sense in the context of the novel: > You could tell he really believed that but there was something wrong about > what he was saying. Something that didn't jell. And I thought of Lallie's > warning to Danny. She had told him not to let the dark flame of the past > consume the future. > > \\"Lallie and the Chain? That's about right winning out over wrong.\\" Danny > grinned at me, an engaging urchin's and in spite of being horrified over > what he had told me I found myself smiling back. \\"Yeah well, I'm an > idealist.\\" \\\\- (page 123) Personal demons To reach a more personal, relatable level with this broad theme, Carmody uses the inner turmoil of Nathanial to mirror the novel's grand struggle between Light and Dark. The recurring theme of his father, who haunts Nathanial's nightmares as a violent monster, strikes an unsettling note of uncertainty within the character about his own nature; he wonders whether he himself is a violent monster. He sees reflections of this in even his academic studies, citing Hamlet as an example of how \\"thinkers rarely act, but when they do, they are capable of terrible carnage.\\"The other Chain members all also have personal demons to overcome that somehow reflect the central struggle and also could be credited as the reasons they became involved in that struggle to begin with. Nathanial Delaney is subconsciously tormented by the memory of his violent father. He is 15 years old. He and his mother moved to Cheshunt and attends Three North High School, which is where most of the evil planning takes place. He is the main character and is the eye of completion. He also likes fellow \\"Chain\\" member Nissa Jerome. He is the circle/ring of time. Danny Odin, as previously explained, has been a victim of police brutality. He is the torch of justice. Nissa Jerome, the hardened and guarded wild orphan girl, is revealed to have had her heart broken as a young girl by one of her desirable mother's many boyfriends, who had claimed to be in love with her and then rejected and humiliated her. Viciously and emotionally damaged, she effectively \\"closed up\\" and never let anybody become even remotely attached to her from there on in: \\"I made a vow to myself then, that I'd never love anyone again. Not like that. From then on, I relied on nobody and took care of myself.\\" (page 182) She is the sword of strength. Indian (\\"Homer\\" in the American version), whose real name is Frank, a young man with a pony tail and a strong build, is revealed to be a literal pacifist because of an eternal guilt that he bears over the brain damage his younger sister sustained under his supervision many years ago. He refuses to retaliate when provoked and especially assaulted, as he feels that he retains no right to defend himself: \\"I don't fight back because I deserve to be hurt. Because of Jenny. That's my punishment.\\" (page 158). He is the bowl of healing. Seth Paul, the least central member of The Chain, is described frequently as \\"perfect\\", in many respects: personality, physical features, academic, sporting and social achievements. It is this very reputation, and the pressure induced by it, that is his deepest burden: Seth is a hopeless alcoholic, blindly alienated, emotionally weak and without any concernable self-esteem. He is apparently, and unrequitedly in love with Nissa and in Chapter 18 he attempts to commit suicide. His father is the head of the Cheshunt Police Division and reports to Mr. Karle. Seth is consequently under consistent pressure to side with his father and join the Dark, which he ultimately does, but at the last minute redeems himself, to the prompting and forgiveness of The Chain. He is the eye that seeks. Fascism and World Society References Despite exploration into the nature of evil in philosophical and fantasy terms, Carmody's depiction of evil as an authoritarian dictatorship society is very realistic and socially significant and more than one or two parallels can be drawn with such societies as Nazi Germany. Comparisons such as these are even specifically referenced in the book; for example, where Nathanial, enraged at his mother for calling the police on him, tells her \\"they acted like Nazis!\\" (page 59). While the ideas of evil in The Gathering do not involve the systematic extermination of any one people, the intimation of a society ruled strictly and brutally by one dictator is integral to the story's stress on the importance of individualism and independent thought in modern civilisation. Carmody's career Isobelle Carmody is probably most famous for her epic Obernewtyn Chronicles, a fantasy series set in a post- apocalyptic realm of social disarray. While her principal focus still remains on society, in many forms, The Gathering was the first of her novels to be set in a time and place that exist in reality (early '90s Australia), an approach that immediately gives it a stark realism. Another unusual technique used in the book is that of an author narrating their story from the perspective of a member of the opposite gender (see the Tomorrow series, by John Marsden). There were no wide criticisms of her choice to do so; the voice of Nathanial was not, strangely, targeted as being unauthentic. These two basic writing techniques set The Gathering apart from almost any of Carmody's other work.

The larger Escudo hummingbird from Isla Escudo de Veraguas in Panama is commonly considered a subspecies of the rufous-tailed hummingbird. This is a common to abundant bird of open country, river banks, woodland, scrub, forest edge, coffee plantations and gardens up to . Description The adult rufous-tailed hummingbird is long and weighs approximately . The throat is green (edged whitish in the female), the crown, back and flanks are green tinged golden, the belly is pale greyish, the vent and rump are rufous and the slightly forked tail is rufous with a dusky tip. The almost straight bill is red with a black tip; the black is more extensive on the upper mandible, which may appear all black. Immatures are virtually identical to the female. The call is a low chut, and the male's song is a whistled tse we ts‚Äô we or tse tse wip tseek tse. The female rufous-tailed hummingbird is entirely responsible for nest building and incubation. She lays two white eggs in a compact cup nest constructed from plant-fibre and dead leaves and decorated with lichens and mosses high on a thin horizontal twig. Incubation takes 15‚Äì19 days, and fledging another 20‚Äì26. Diet The food of this species is nectar, taken from a variety of flowers, including Heliconias and bananas. Like other hummingbirds, it also takes small insects as an essential source of protein. Rufous-tailed hummingbirds are very aggressive, and defend flowers and shrubs in their feeding territories. They are dominant over most other hummingbirds.

He graduated from the School of Dentistry at University of the Pacific. Dr. Lee was born in 1881 in San Francisco, California to Lee Tong Hay, a lay leader of the forming Chinese Methodist ChurchOur Pastors associated with Rev. Dr. Otis Gibson's missions that would become the Chinese Community United Methodist Church.Chinese Community United Methodist Church . about us After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake Dr. Lee relocated to San Jose, California then settling in Oakland becoming Oakland Chinatown's first dentist. His practice continued until his retirement in 1940. He was an active participant in civil affairs founding Oakland's Chinese American Citizens Alliance in 1912. Lee was also a lay leader of the Chinese Community Methodist Church of Oakland, a member of the Oakland Chinese Center and a member of the Lee Family Benevolent Association. He was married to Clara Elizabeth Chan who was the first Chinese American woman to register to vote in the United States. He is interred in Oakland. Activism In 1912, Dr. Lee became one of six men who founded the Chinese American Citizens Alliance (C.A.C.A) Oakland Lodge (members including Chew Keung, Wong W. Kai, Jow Pong and Chancey Chan). The organization was formally named Native Sons of the Golden State, but after the earthquake of 1906 some members moved across the Bay to Oakland where there was a growing number of Chinese Americans. All of the founding men took the opportunity to purchase a building for the organization by each placing a deposit down for the headquarters. Complications arose after purchasing the building when the previous tenants required the members to pay ‚Äúremodeling fees‚Äù before they were able to move in. So, all the members proceeded to pay for these repair fees with their own money, as well still coming together to buy the building. Dr. Lee contributed the largest payment for the purchasing of the building as well as the repair fees. As a member of the Oakland Lodge, Dr. Lee fought for the civil rights, equal economical and political opportunities, and the general welfare of Chinese Americans. Lee Benevolent Association Dr. Lee and his wife, Elizabeth, were also members of the Lee Family Benevolent Association. They were formed in the 1800s as social service organizations for new immigrants, based on their last names, which signify their home villages in China. Now, they're very politically powerful; the Chinese Six Companies, one of the city's oldest benevolent organizations, serves as an umbrella organization for all the family groups. The Lee Family Benevolent Association is responsible for swearing in the first Chinese American mayor of San Francisco. Chinese Community Methodist Church Dr. Lee became a lay leader in the church after he set up his dental practice in the early 1900s. Charles' father-in-law, Chan Hon, was a reverend at the church; his father, Lee Tong Hay, was also a reverend. The church was originally established for schools and to help women escape slavery and prostitution; now, the organization serves as a religious worshipping place for Chinese Americans in Oakland. The Lees become known to exemplify the Chinese Community Methodist Church's tradition of community involvement and social justice.

History In scripted comments read on the First Anniversary Special of CBS Radio's Saturday Night Swing Club, on which the Raymond Scott Quintette performed, host Paul Douglas announced that \\"Powerhouse\\" had been premiered on that program in January or early February 1937.Amazon.com Saturday Night Swing Scott's Quintette (actually a sextet) first recorded \\"Powerhouse\\" in New York on February 20, 1937, along with three other titles. This recording was first commercially issued on the Irving Mills-owned Master Records label as Master 111 (mx. M-120-1), coupled with another Scott composition, \\"The Toy Trumpet\\". After the demise of the Master label late in 1937, \\"Powerhouse\\" was reissued on Brunswick 7993, and subsequently on Columbia 36311 (after the CBS purchase of ARC, which included the Brunswick catalog). The same take was issued on all releases.78discography.com MASTER Records numerical listing discography (An unreleased 1939 recording by the original Scott Quintette was issued in 2002 on the 2-CD Scott compilation Microphone Music.) Both \\"Powerhouse\\" and \\"The Toy Trumpet\\" remained in Scott's repertoire for decades, both were adapted for Warner Bros. cartoon soundtracks by WB music director Carl Stalling along with a dozen other Scott titles, and both have been recorded by numerous other artists. Stalling, who spiced his scores with \\"Powerhouse\\" dozens of times,Biography for Carl W. Stalling at IMDB never created a complete version of the work, with all his adaptations existing as excerpts. The United States publisher of the title is Music Sales Corporation. Outside the U.S., the title is controlled by Warner/Chappell Music. Structure Structurally, \\"Powerhouse\\" consists of two distinct ‚Äì and seemingly unrelated ‚Äì musical themes, played at different tempos. Both have been used in numerous cartoons. The first theme, sometimes referred to as \\"Powerhouse A,\\" is a frantic passage typically employed in chase and high-speed vehicle scenes to imply whirlwind velocity. The slower theme, \\"Powerhouse B,\\" is the \\"assembly line\\" music, which sometimes accompanies scenes of repetitive, machine-like activity. \\"Powerhouse\\" in its entirety places \\"B\\" in the center while \\"A\\" opens and closes the work in the sequence A-B-A (Ternary form). Personnel *Raymond Scott - piano *Dave Harris - saxophone *Pete Pumiglio - clarinet *Dave Wade - trumpet *Louis Shoobe - double bass *Johnny Williams - drums Use in cartoon works The first use of \\"Powerhouse\\" in a cartoon occurred in the 1943 Warner Bros. Looney Tunes short Porky Pig's Feat, directed by Frank Tashlin. Also in 1943, it was used in the Private Snafu shorts Gripes, Spies, and Rumors. It was subsequently featured in over 40 other Warner Bros. cartoons.Index of Raymond Scott titles in Warner Bros. cartoons at RaymondScott.net The most well-known \\"assembly-line\\" usage of \\"Powerhouse B\\" occurs in Bob Clampett's Baby Bottleneck (1946), in which newborn babies (of various species) are processed on a conveyor belt in time to the melody. The \\"Powerhouse A\\" section featured prominently during Bugs Bunny's altercation with a gremlin in Clampett's 1943 Merrie Melodies cartoon Falling Hare. The 1953 Merrie Melodies cartoon Duck Dodgers in the 24¬Ωth Century, directed by Chuck Jones, contains Stalling's lengthiest adaptation of the \\"Powerhouse A\\" section, clocking in at one minute and twenty-five seconds. Other Warner cartoons which contain excerpts from \\"Powerhouse\\" include Birdy and the Beast (1944), Cat-Tails for Two (1953), Early to Bet (1951), Falling Hare (1943), His Bitter Half (1950), House-Hunting Mice (1948), It's Hummer Time (1950), Jumpin' Jupiter (1955), Rocket Squad (1956), Sheep in the Deep (1962), Compressed Hare (1961), and dozens more.Warner Bros. cartoon montage featuring \\"Powerhouse\\" adaptations In the 1960s, producer Hal Seeger and composer/arranger Winston Sharples adapted \\"Powerhouse\\" and other Scott compositions in dozens of episodes of their Batfink cartoon series.RaymondScott.net Raymond Scott's Music in Other Cartoons The original Raymond Scott Quintette recordings, including \\"Powerhouse,\\" were licensed in the early 1990s for soundtrack usage in twelve episodes of The Ren and Stimpy Show.RaymondScott.net Raymond Scott music in Ren & Stimpy Various passages of the tune have been arranged for use in The Simpsons, Duckman, The Bernie Mac Show, and The Drew Carey Show (in a brief scene involving an animated character). An entire 1993 episode of Animaniacs, \\"Toy Shop Terror,\\" was set to Warner Bros. music director Richard Stone's arrangement of the composition. \\"Powerhouse\\" also served as bumper theme music for Cartoon Network from 1997 to 2003, and can be heard as a systematic rock theme in the 2003 feature film Looney Tunes: Back in Action. \\"Powerhouse\\" has been used In The Simpsons four times. The first occurs in \\"And Maggie Makes Three\\" (Season 6, Episode 13) during a montage of a bowling pin assembly line. In the episode \\"Bart Has Two Mommies\\" (Season 17, Episode 14), \\"Powerhouse\\" B is adapted in a scene that pays homage to the 1937 Disney short The Old Mill, when Homer Simpson gets caught in the Old Mill while trying to save his Rubber Duckie. In the episode \\"Little Big Girl\\" (Season 18, Episode 12), \\"Powerhouse\\" was used during the sequence where the fire at Cletus' farm is lit. In the episode \\"The Fool Monty\\" (Season 22, Episode 6), \\"Powerhouse\\" was adapted as background music for a construction scene in which Charles Montgomery Burns, having lost his memory, is led to a dangerous construction site by Homer Simpson, who seeks revenge for Burns' years of cruel behavior. Burns walks along moving girders, narrowly avoids flying rivets, and other well-worn cartoon construction site gags. Simpsons creator Matt Groening once ranked \\"Powerhouse\\" as #14 on a list of his \\"100 Favorite Things.\\" In the SpongeBob SquarePants episode \\"Broken Alarm\\" from season 12, an arrangement of the song plays over a scene of SpongeBob SquarePants using a Rube Goldberg machine to get to work. Recent performances, recordings, and usages In recent years, Powerhouse has been recorded by jazz clarinetist Don Byron on his album Bug Music,Amazon.com Bug Music jazz pianist Ted Kooshian on his 2009 CD Ted Kooshian's Standard Orbit Quartet: Underdog, and other Stories..., pedal steel guitarist Jon Rauhouse, The Metropole Orchestra, The Beau Hunks Sextette, The Coctails, and jazz guitarist Skip Heller. The title, as arranged by Michelle DiBucci, has been in the repertoire of Kronos Quartet since 1994. The rock band Rush adapted part of \\"Powerhouse\\" in their 1978 instrumental \\"La Villa Strangiato\\" (5:49 into the track) on their Hemispheres album, as did ska/soul band The Pietasters in Factory Concerto on their 1993 self-titled album, and alternative band Soul Coughing featured it in their song \\"Bus to Beelzebub\\" from their 1994 album Ruby Vroom. The tune has also been appropriated by They Might Be Giants (on the song \\"Rhythm Section Want Ad\\"), Devo (on \\"Fraulein\\"), and others. Other contemporary artists who have recorded versions of \\"Powerhouse\\" include Thelonious Moog, The Tiptons (with Amy Denio), Quartet San Francisco,ViolinJazz.com Quartet San Francisco and Steroid Maximus (featuring J. G. Thirlwell). Lee Presson and the Nails included the song on their album Jump-swing from Hell: Live At the Hi-ball Lounge. In 2006-2007, the \\"assembly line\\" theme was used in a highly choreographed commercial for the Visa check card. The commercial, entitled \\"Lunch\\", was staged in a manner intended to be reminiscent of the song's cartoon uses. In August 2009, Sinking Ship Productions staged a musical portrait of Raymond Scott entitled Powerhouse at the New York International Fringe Festival. The composition \\"Powerhouse\\" was used as a recurring theme. Sinking Ship presented a revised and fully-staged version of the production at the New Ohio Theatre in Manhattan in 2014. On August 8, 2013, the Raymond Scott Orchestrette performed an arrangement of \\"Powerhouse\\" to accompany Dance Heginbotham's choreographic work Manhattan Research at New York's Lincoln Center Out Of Doors summer concert series.Seibert, Brian, \\"Would Daffy Approve?

It is based in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India and has interests in the downstream oil business. RPL was merged with Reliance Industries Limited on September 29, 2009. Reliance Petroleum and RIL own / have long term chartered two oil rigs - DD KG-1 and DD KG-2 (DD standing for Dhirubhai Deepwater). They are both drilling ships registered in Marshall Islands and owned by Deepwater Pacific Inc., a subsidiary of Transocean.  Jamnagar Refinery  With an annual crude processing capacity of per stream day, RPL is the largest refinery in the world. It will have a complexity of 21.0, using the Nelson Complexity Index, ranking it one of the highest in the sector. The polypropylene plant will have a capacity to produce 0.9 million metric tonnes per annum. The refinery project is being implemented at a capital cost of Rs 270,000 million being funded through a mix of equity and debt. This represents a capital cost of less than US$10,000 per barrel per day and compares very favourably with the average capital cost of new refineries announced in recent years. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates the average capital cost of new refinery in the OECD nations to be in the region of US$15,000 to 20,000 per barrel per day. The low capital cost of RPL becomes even more attractive when adjusted for high complexity of the refinery. Controversies In 2012, reports surfaced in the media highlighting the fact that ONGC had chartered an oil rig owned by RIL in May 2009 (Dhirubhai Deepwater KG-1, also known as DDKG-1)without taking bids from any other companies. This was revealed in the report published by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), the overseer of expenditures of the Indian Government. RIL also owed ONGC Rs. 92,000 crores, which were already overdue by 2 years at that time. However, as of 2018, this outstanding amount was still not paid to ONGC by RIL.

This system restricts the prediction using the parameters solubility and intestinal permeability. The solubility classification is based on a United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) aperture. The intestinal permeability classification is based on a comparison to the intravenous injection. All those factors are highly important because 85% of the most sold drugs in the United States and Europe are orally administered .  BCS classes  BCS classes According to the Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) drug substances are classified to four classes upon their solubility and permeability: *Class I - high permeability, high solubility ** Example: metoprolol, paracetamol ** Those compounds are well absorbed and their absorption rate is usually higher than excretion. *Class II - high permeability, low solubility ** Example: glibenclamide, bicalutamide, ezetimibe, aceclofenac ** The bioavailability of those products is limited by their solvation rate. A correlation between the in vivo bioavailability and the in vitro solvation can be found. *Class III - low permeability, high solubility ** Example: cimetidine ** The absorption is limited by the permeation rate but the drug is solvated very fast. If the formulation does not change the permeability or gastro-intestinal duration time, then class I criteria can be applied. *Class IV - low permeability, low solubility ** Example: Bifonazole ** Those compounds have a poor bioavailability. Usually they are not well absorbed over the intestinal mucosa and a high variability is expected. Definitions The drugs are classified in BCS on the basis of solubility, permeability, and dissolution. Solubility class boundaries are based on the highest dose strength of an immediate release product. A drug is considered highly soluble when the highest dose strength is soluble in 250 ml or less of aqueous media over the pH range of 1 to 7.5. The volume estimate of 250 ml is derived from typical bioequivalence study protocols that prescribe administration of a drug product to fasting human volunteers with a glass of water. Permeability class boundaries are based indirectly on the extent of absorption of a drug substance in humans and directly on the measurement of rates of mass transfer across human intestinal membrane. Alternatively non-human systems capable of predicting drug absorption in humans can be used (such as in-vitro culture methods). A drug substance is considered highly permeable when the extent of absorption in humans is determined to be 90% or more of the administered dose based on a mass-balance determination or in comparison to an intravenous dose. For dissolution class boundaries, an immediate release product is considered rapidly dissolving when no less than 85% of the labeled amount of the drug substance dissolves within 15 minutes using USP Dissolution Apparatus 1 at 100 RPM or Apparatus 2 at 50 RPM in a volume of 900 ml or less in the following media: 0.1 M HCl or simulated gastric fluid or pH 4.5 buffer and pH 6.8 buffer or simulated intestinal fluid.

It is located southeast of Brunswick Peninsula. It is often lashed with harsh Antarctic weather. The settlements are Puerto Harris, Puerto San Antonio and Puerto Almeida.  History  This area was inhabited for thousands of years by the indigenous peoples. At the time of European encounter, the Kaw√©sqar lived on the island (they were called the Alcalufe by the Yahgan and the Europeans adopted that term). They lived west of the Yahgan and throughout the islands west of Tierra del Fuego. Beginning in the late 19th century, Europeans began to settle in the region, developing large sheep ranches on the main island. Miners also flocked to the area in search of gold. Chile used Dawson Island for an internment camp for the Selknam and other native people, to get them out of areas that settlers were trying to develop. Major sheep ranchers hired armed men to hunt down the indigenous people for bounty in the Selk'nam genocide, as they persisted on hunting in their former territory and considered sheep as game. In 1890, the Chilean government granted Salesian missionaries from Italy a 20-year concession to Dawson Island to educate, care for, and try to assimilate indigenous peoples into European-Chilean culture. One of the structures from the Salesian operation remains. It has been designated a Chilean national monument. After the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat, the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet used the island to house political prisoners suspected of being communist activists, including government ministers and close friends of the deposed President Salvador Allende, most notably Orlando Letelier, Luis Corval√°n, Clodomiro Almeyda and Jos√© Toh√°. They were under the strict control of the Chilean Navy as each individual case was investigated. In addition, according to an International Red Cross report in 1974The Chile Information Project: Dawson Island and the Report of the Chilean National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation (Rettig report) some 99 political detainees were held here who were sentenced to forced labor. Others have estimated that as many as 400 prisoners were held at the two camps. Members of the International Red Cross, BBC, and Brazilian press corps were permitted to visit the camps. In 1974 the military said they had transferred elsewhere or released detainees from both camps. In 2009 director Miguel Littin released a film called Dawson, Isla 10. It was based on a memoir of the same name written by Sergio Bitar, a former political prisoner.

Bhopas of Pabusar are the bards and also priests who are the traditional narrators of this art form. The Phad is also spelt as ‚ÄúPar.‚Äù This art form is popular in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Literally, 'Pabuji Ki Phad' translates into two versions namely, \\"The Screen of Pabuji or O, Read of Pabuji!. Pabuji is also known as \\"the Ascetic Deity of Sand Desert\\". The three basic features associated with this art form are: the epic story of Pabuji, the Rathod chief of Rajasthan in the 14th century, who is extolled as an incarnation of Hindu God, and worshipped by the Rabari tribals of Rajasthan; the Phad or Par, which is a long scroll painting (or sewn) made on cloth, with the martial heroics of Pabuji richly displayed for worship; and the bard priests, known as the Bhopas (who belong to the cult of Pabhuji) of the nomadic tribe of Nayakas and specialists in narrating the story of the Pabuji in their sartorial best through the medium of the Phads used as a portable temple, all over the desert lands of the Thar in Rajasthan. History Folk- deity Pabuji in Pabuji Ki Phad, a Phad painting at National Museum, New Delhi Pabuji is worshipped as a folk-deity. He lived in the 14th century (the 16th century is also mentioned) in a remote village known as Kulu in Rajasthan. Dhadal Rathore of village Kolu had four children: two boys, Buro the older and Pabuji the younger brother, and two girls, Sona and Pema. However, Pabuji was stated to be born to a nymph and as foretold by the nymph she was to return after 12 years as a mare to be with him. In his young age, Pabhuji fought against the Khici clan to evict them from his land that they had encroached and killed their leader, Jindrav Khinchi. During this period, he also acquired a black horse from Lady Daval (goddess worshipped in Kolu) of Charan Clan and it is believed that this horse was in the reborn form of his own mother. He then went on to defeat Mirza Khan who was indulging in the killing of cows, which are held sacred by the Hindus and Muslim plunderer named Muslim marauder Mirza Khan Patan and also protected honour of the womenfolk. An eventful part of Pabhuji‚Äôs life was the marriage of Kelam, his favourite niece, to his friend, the snake deity of Rajasthan, known as Gogaji. At this wedding, while the wedding guests presented the couple with rich gifts (such as diamonds, pearls, an exquisite dress made from best cloth of South India, white cows, horses, elephants and so forth), Pabuji only promised her camels from Lanka (Lanka referred here is not the island of Sri Lanka, but refers to a kingdom west of the Indus River). He then went in search of a herd of camels to Lanka. After fighting and defeating the local ruler Ravana of Lanka, he then brought the herd of camels for his niece. When he was returning with the camels, he passed through Umarkot in Sindh (now in Pakistan). There, he fell in love with the princess Pulvati and after lot of persuasion married her.Dalrymple, pp. 97‚Äì98 The Kulu village where Pabhu was born, now has only two conventional but small temples within a courtyard, where Puja (worship) is offered to the Pabuji. This village was known as the \\"great village fortress of Kolu\\" and it included the shrine of goddess Daval. The deity has still not attained the status for universal worship through building of many other temples elsewhere. Hence, only small shrines and commemorative stones are found in and around Kolu. Another reason attributed to the inadequate representation in the form of many temples to Pabhuji is that the Bhopas are semi-nomadic and a traveling group who are not rooted to one place where they could build a temple for daily worship. Rabaris, also a semi-nomadic tribe and who are cattle herders of the region also revere Pabuji and consider it as the ‚Äúmyth of their origin‚Äù.Dalrymple, p. 98 In villages of Rajasthan, Pabuji was considered an ascetic and hence his blessings were sought for veterinary services provided by his disciples, the Bhopas. He is also invoked to cure children possessed of spirits by driving away the djinn; this is done by tying an amulet created during the early hours of the morning, towards the end of the narration of the Phad, by circling a holy thread seven times around the flame and then seven knots. The epic story of Pabhuji has been analysed by historians with respect to the other epic stories of Ramayana and Mahabharata and the conclusion drawn is that the Pabuji tradition is \\"one multilayered and collective narrative construction of different Rajasthani performers, transmitted in oral and written forms. A panoramic view of the Pabhuji Ki Phad displayed in a museum The Phad The Phad canvas is usually of sheet cloth, on which are painted (or sewn) miniature scenes depicting the life of Pabuji and his adventures.Smith, John D. (2005). The Epic of Pabuji, New Delhi: Katha, , pp.15-6Dalrymple, p.98 The Phad or Par represents, in its painting, the court of Pabuji (as a historical true Rajput chief who sacrifices his life for protection of others), his palace and his divine character as an incarnation of Laksmana, brother of the Rama of the Ramayana Hindu epic story, the forts in which he lived as well as the sanctum of his goddess Deval. The backdrop of such narrations is invariably in the desert villages of Rajasthan. The images in the painting are arranged logically, also showing revengeful exploits of his nephew on his enemy, Jindrav Khici. However, iconographically it is considered as \\"extremely complex and intricate.\\"Dalrymple, p.88 The depictions (as shown in the image in the infobox) shows according to historian William Dalrymple a \\"panorama of medieval Rajasthan: women, horses, peacocks, carts, archers, battles, washer-men and fishermen, kings and queens, huge grey elephants and herds of white cows and buff camels, many-armed demons, fish- tailed wonder-creatures and blue-skinned gods, all arranged around the central outsized figure of Pabuji, his magnificent black mare, Kesar Kalami, and his four great companions and brothers-in-arms. The sequence of images (see infobox) painted on the Pabuji Ki Phad is: the main deity - Pabhuji - is at the centre and to his right is his court with his four principal companions, on the left of the main deity, is the court of Buro, his brother. At the extreme left is Umarkot and at the left edge, Lanka. To the right of Pabuji's court is the court of the Lady Deval (goddess of Kolu). At the far right of the painting is Khici's court. The blank spaces in between are depicted with scenes of Pabuji's journey from Rajasthan to Umarkot, and also images of Ganesh, Sarasvati and Vishnu in different incarnations that are painted at the top of the Phad or Par. The Phad, from the time it is painted by the renowned painters of this art form, is treated with utmost reverence by the Bophas. They make daily offerings to the Phad. It is considered a hereditary possession and is passed on to one of their kin to continue the tradition. As the Phad gets worn or torn or becomes threadbare, a formal religious procedure is followed to decommission it. This procedure is called tandakarna in Hindi, which means to cool or remove its divine power. This is done by confining to the holy waters of the Ganges or Pushkar Lake. Bhopas Bhopa community in Rajasthan is considered to be of priest singers of Pabuji. They hail from the village of Pabusar(named after the hero of the epic) and are traced to the 16th century, though 14th century is also mentioned. It is also said that sweet water well was located in the village by Pabuji. They belong to the Nayak community, a Scheduled Caste community of Rajasthan. Phads are integral to the Bhopas' vocation and are considered the ‚Äúepic qua religious service.‚Äù They perform this art form through a combination of folk singing and dancing interspersed with interludes to interact with the audience in front of a scroll or canvas, known as Phad or Par in Rajasthani that depicts the episodes of the narrative of the folk deity. The Phad functions as a 'portable temple.' The Bhopas carry the Phad traditionally and are invited by villagers to perform in their localities during times of sickness and misfortune. The Phads are kept rolled during transit. After reaching a village or town, the Bhopas erect the Phad between two poles under a shamiana (an open tent)in a suitable public place shortly after nightfall. The performance goes on throughout the night and terminates only towards dawn.Smith, John D. (2005). The Epic of Pabuji, New Delhi: Katha, , p. 156Dalrymple, pp. 82‚Äì83, 96‚Äì98 Narration The Phad The narrative usually held by the Bhopas in the backdrop of Rajasthani deserts, is narrated by the poet-singers as a structured rendition of the epic story, called the Pabuprakasa, glorifying Pabuji as a divine being. The rendering is highly \\"stylized and formulistic in its narration\\". The text, which has a number of episodes, belongs to two different types namely, the parvaros and the sayls. The narrative of Pabuji, in particular, is recorded in the Khyata of Muhato Nainasi, a text with the title Vata Pabujiri. The entire narration relates to Pabuji and his heroic deeds. This epic, a courtly religious poem invoking Pabuji has 4,000 lines. Its recitation, from start to the end, takes full five nights of 8 hours duration from dusk to dawn; it is rarely fully recited now. The present trend of narration has many intermissions for taking tea, singing devotional songs (bhajans), popular film music, thus making it partly an entertainment coupled with the ‚Äúreligious ritual of invoking Pabuji as a living deity‚Äù. The musical and sometimes chanted narration is in colloquial Rajasthani dialect. Bhopa is the main singer (narrator) who does it with an accompaniment of a musical instrument, called the ravanhattho (a desert zither or a spike fiddle with eighteen strings but without frets), which he crafts by himself. A dholak or drum is also part of the musical ensemble. During the entire narration, Bhopa‚Äôs wife called the Bhopi, is present with him and joins him in singing. She also carries a lantern to shed light on the Phad when Bhopa is indicating to some scenes on the Phad linked to his narration. The singer has a stick with which he points out each scene and narrates the story. He also sometimes dances to his songs and interjects his performance with jokes and banter with the audience. There are several such itinerant Bhopa groups performing in various parts of Rajasthan. One of the famous narrators of the epic named Mohan from Pabusar was an illiterate but he could recite the entire 4000 lines of the epic. The narration of the epic is done in the jagarans (night-wakes) time to invoke the prakas, meaning the presence of the folk deities, in the Rajasthani dialect. The set sequence for the narration, which in local language, called the phad vacno or performance is in the following order. * Purification rites involving erecting of the Phad is preceded by sanctifying the site by cleaning the land below the Phad and lighting incense sticks. A small jyot (lamp) made of cowdung is lit in front of the Phad and then circled around the Phad of Phabuji. * The procedure for stretching the Phad involves running a string through the red band stitched at the top and then tie the rope to wooden or bamboo posts at both ends. * The bard narrating the epic, the Bhopa, is dressed in a costume called the baga. The Bhopa announces the start of the narration by blowing the Conch shell * Devotees offer grains and money for consecrating the Phad * The deities depicted on the Phad are then invoked. * The narration of the epic story by the Bhopas is ‚Äúprosimetric.‚Äù The narration of verse sections is called gavs, which has a number of couplets known as karis. This is followed by the narration of the prose sections called arthavs (explanations). Each scene on the Phad is specifically shown with a wand by the Bhopas and then narrated * Collection of monetary contributions is part of the frequent intermissions for food, tea, tobacco or rest. Every time a donation is received, the Bhopa makes the announcement by blowing a conch- shell and mentioning the name of the donor. * At the conclusion of the performance, the Bhopas do an arati (offering of a lighted lamp for the deities) to the characters on the Phad, which is followed by another round of donations before the Phad is rolled up before dawn The Phad's epic narrations are attended primarily by the traditionally nomadic and camel-herding Rabari caste (for Pabuji is their principal deity). The Rajputs of Pabu‚Äôs own warrior caste also attend. It represents navrasas or nine forms of Indian classical aesthetics such as love, war, devotion and so forth in it. Its particular theme is enthralling and is more on bravery so much so that it is said that due to ‚Äúa narration of the tale, the gross gets burned around it‚Äù.Dalrymple, pp.96‚Äì97 Though they cater to the village Rajputs, narration is also attended by the Rajputs of the royal class. Present day narratives have drawn parallels with the Ramayana episodes to create divine attributes of the deities to Pabuji and the other characters. One writer attributes this development as ‚Äúregarding Pabuji and other characters as avatars of Sanskritic deities and personages, though Brahmin influence is still minimal. Pabuji seems to be worshipped for very worldly ends, namely sound health, or its recovery, prosperity, a good marriage, a successful childbirth, and so on. Traditional Brahminic spirituality of moksha and mention of the Vedas is still virtually absent.‚ÄùDalrymple, pp.88, 97‚Äì98 An annual festival of Pabuji Ki Phad epic narration is held at Pabusar when 10,000 to 15,000 people are said to attend. This annual event is arranged and popularised by the Jaipur Virasat Foundation. Phad painters The Phads or Pars are painted by professional painters called citero. Well known professional painters are known by the clan name 'Josi' of the Chipa caste. Their expertise is in textile-printing and they operate from their traditional towns of Shahpura and Bhilwara in Bhilwara district of Rajasthan. There are at least seventeen or eighteen painters involved in painting this art form. However, Shree Lal Joshi and Shanti Lal Joshi are the most noted artists of the phad painting, who are known for their innovations and creativity. Bhopas also say that the painting made by Shree Lal Joshi have \\"the powers to exorcise any spirit...once the Phad was complete and the eyes of the hero were painted in, neither the artist nor the Bhopa regarded it as a piece of art. Instead it instantly became a mobile temple: as Pabuji's devotees were semi-nomadic herders, his temple -the Phad visited the worshippers rather than the other way round.\\" Dalrymple, p.84 ;Painting method It is a hereditary art form, which is passed on from father to son. A Bhopa commission's this painting for religious purpose. The painting is drawn on a cotton cloth. The cloth is first prepared by applying a paste of flour and gum. It is then polished with a stone. An auspicious date is chosen for starting the painting since it is used for religious purpose by the Bhopa. A virgin girl only has the privilege of giving the first stroke of the brush on the Phad painting; normally the girl belongs to the painter's family or to a high-caste. An outline of the painting is drawn by the artist with light yellow colour paint; only earth colours or vegetable colours or indigo are used. The colours are then mixed with gum and water, and painted one colour after the other, in the order of orange, yellow, and so forth. Black is the last colour paint used for the border. Again, on an auspicious day, the painting is signed by the artist at the centre of the painting, close to the image of the main deity. Signature of the Bhopa who commissions the painting is also included, but it is optional. As a last act, the artist is said to give 'life' or \\"awaken the deity\\" of the painting by opening the pupil in the eyes of the main deity at the centre of the painting. It then becomes the Pabhuji Ki Phad of the Bhopa who has commissioned it. The earliest painting of a Phad or Par, as mentioned by John Smith, a scholar of the \\"Epic of Pabuji\\", is dated to 1867. Colonel James Tod, the British Lieutenant reported of a ceremony that included a Par painting in 1819. With the emphasis on bardic narration of Pabhuji Ki Phad said to be on the decline in recent times, painters of Pars or Phads are also making Phads as collector's items in smaller sizes, and with different religious and other themes. Other narration A painting of God Devnarayan along with goddess Saadu Maata Gurjari Another folk hero of Rajasthan, Devnarayan, a Gurjar warrior, was a historical figure of ninth century (born on 911AD).He is worshiped as incarnation of Lord Vishnu. His legendary epic, written much much earlier to that of the Epic of Pabhuji, is also popular and painted on Phads. They are popular among the Gurjar community as their special deity. The Devnarayan Phads are painted on a bigger canvas of 35 feet x 5 feet and are sung in the same manner as the Pabhuji epic. This epic is also sung by the Bhopas. In this case, even the furling of the Phad is signalled by the blowing of conches. Both men and women attend the performances. However, the women of the community identify Devnarayan in the form of Lord Krishna and sing songs, outside of the ritual, on the episodes related to baby Krishna. Devnarayan temples in Rajasthan depict the paintings of Phads of Devanarayan.Dalrymple, pp. 93‚Äì94 See also *Bhopa *Devnarayan References Bibliography * * External links *Bhopas Live Performance: The Folkloric Picture Story_Tellers from Rajasthan *A website on phad painting and phad artist prakash joshi *A website on phad painting Category:Folk deities of Rajasthan Category:Hindu deities in art Category:Indian painting Category:Rajasthani arts ","title":"Pabuji Ki Phad"},{"id":"4248467","text":"Pul-e-Charkhi Prison (Pashto/Persian: ÿ≤ŸÜÿØÿßŸÜ ŸæŸÑ ⁄Üÿ±ÿÆ€å), also known as the Afghan National Detention Facility, is the largest prison in Afghanistan.

By January 2008, as many as 125 detainees from the Parwan Detention Facility and 32 detainees from the U.S. Guantanamo Bay detention camp had been transferred to Pul-e-Charkhi.

The prison had been cited as overcrowded and the living conditions as sub-par. There had been eight cell blocks but only three were being used which has caused overcrowding.Pul-e-Charkhi Jail inmates face awful life There are also about 70 female prisoners who are housed in a special female section of the prison. Riots and escapes In December 2004, foreign prisoners attacked guards with razor blades. A subsequent shoot-out left one Iraqi and three Pakistani prisoners and four Afghan police dead. In January 2006, seven prisoners escaped by mingling with visitors. A month later, a riot was sparked by a new prison policy forcing prisoners to wear bright orange clothing, a rule enacted to avoid events similar to the January escape. The February 2006 riot resulted in six deaths and 22 injured according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. The rioters used makeshift weapons to attack guards, then ignited furniture on fire, and smashed doors and windows. They eventually took over a wing of the prison and held it for a few days. The riot finally ended on the first of March.Afghanistan: Who Instigated The Pol-e Charkhi Prison Riot And Why? On 16 March 2008, after a two-week dispute over arrests following an attempted jail-break, inmates rioted and took over sections of the building. Gunfire was heard in the complex and inmates claimed to be holding hostage two members of the Afghan National Army (ANA). The hostage-takers threatened to kill the ANA members unless mediators were sent in to resolve the conflict.Shooting Rocks main Afghan Prison BBC News 18 March 2008 Renovation and expansion Prisoners being transferred from the Parwan Detention Facility at Bagram to Pul-e- Charkhi prison in 2008. The United States has repeatedly announced that it will be shutting down its Guantanamo Bay detention camps, in Cuba. The Americans planned to transfer most of the captives held in extrajudicial detention in Guantanamo, and in its less well known Parwan Detention Facility to Afghan custody. The initial plan called for reducing the maximum number of men held per cell from the current eight, to just two. For security reasons every cell would be equipped with its own toilet, replacing the current insecure method of letting all the captives leave their cells and share a single toilet at the end of each cell-block. Under this initial plan the modernization of this wing costed $20 million, and would have a maximum capacity of 670 captives. However, after a tour of the facility, during its modernization, it was realized that, for cultural reason, captives could not be expected to share a toilet with another man. Afghan's cultural modesty would not allow a captive to use a toilet with another man present, cutting the capacity of the modernized facility in half. On May 6, 2007, two American soldiers, Colonel James W. Harrison Jr. and Master Sergeant Wilberto Sabalu, part of the oversight team, were shot dead by one of the Afghan guards. This forced a delay on construction as all the guards underwent new security checks. Finally, there was controversy within the Afghan government as to which ministry would be responsible for the modernized part of the prison. By January 2008, 32 captives from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and 125 captives from the Parwan Detention Facility had been transferred to Pul-e- Charkhi. The Center for Constitutional Rights reported that all of the Afghans repatriated to Afghanistan from April 2007 were sent to the Pul-e-Charkhi prison. In February 2009, a team from the United Kingdom's Channel 4 toured the American wing of the prison. By September 2009 the United States had transferred some 250 former detainees from its Guantanamo Bay detention camp to Pul-e-Charkhi, often to the shock of their waiting families, according to Human Rights First (HRF).

Otago has long been associated with several symbols and colours. The St. Andrew's Cross is one such symbol, in recognition of the former province's Scottish settlement. Another, used on the original arms of the province, is the eight-pointed star. Traditionally, the province (as the region is still called) has always been associated with the colours blue and gold, these colours representing Otago's original foundation, on the wealth of gold taken from the rivers of the province during the 1860s gold rush. The blue also again harks back to the flag of Scotland. For many years, these colours were seen in a wide variety of different designs intended to represent Otago. Popular designs included flags quartered in blue and gold, or in blue with a gold saltire. A vertically divided design in blue and gold with the word \\"Otago\\" in white fimbriated in black was also popular and can still be seen in use in the province. In 2004, a campaign was started by prominent local author and regional councillor Neville Peat to decide on a design for a flag for the region as a whole (and more specifically for use by the Otago Regional Council). The design (chosen in late 2004 from several hundred entries submitted) was designed by Gregor Macaulay. It is blazoned Per fess dancetty azure and or, two mullets of eight points in pale counterchanged.

Guwahati Refinery is the first Public Sector refinery of India and belongs to Indian Oil Corporation Limited. The refinery was inaugurated by Late Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of independent India. The refinery was built with Romanian Collaboration and has a capacity of 1.0 million metric tonnes per annum. This refinery process crude oil from Upper Assam Oil Fields, India and helps cater energy need of the region. Major Products of this refinery are # LPG, # Motor Spirit (Petrol), # Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), # Kerosene, # High Speed Diesel, # Light Diesel Oil and # Raw Petroleum Coke. With growing environmental consciousness, Guwahati Refinery, Indian Oil Corporation Limited has also ventured into ecologically friendly fuel and subsequently installed 3 new units: the ISOSIV, the Hydrotreater and the INDMAX. The ISOSIV unit produces Lead Free Petrol by the Molecular Sieve Technology, which separates Octane rich MS components from feed naphtha. The Hydrotreater Unit (HDT) enables the Refinery to produce High Speed Diesel of very low sulphur and cetane number conforming to BIS specifications. The HDT also produces ATF, Superior Kerosene Oil with high smoke point and low sulphur. The Indane Maximization (INDMAX) technology developed by R&D; Centre of Indian Oil installed at the Refinery is designed to achieve LPG yield as high as 44% through Fluidized Catalytic Cracking of residual feed stocks like Reduced Crude Oil, Coker Fuel Oil and Coker Gasolene. The INDMAX unit also enables Guwahati Refinery to upgrade all its residual products to high value distillate products and make it a zero residue Refinery.

Classical utilitarians, including Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, and Henry Sidgwick, define happiness as pleasure and the absence of pain. Overview To understand how act utilitarianism works, compare the consequences of watching television all day tomorrow to the consequences of doing charity work tomorrow. One could produce more overall happiness in the world by doing charity work tomorrow than by watching television all day tomorrow. According to act utilitarianism, then, the right thing to do tomorrow is to go out and do charity work; it is wrong to stay home and watch television all day. Act utilitarianism is based on the principle of utility, which is the basis of all utilitarian theories and is best summed up in Bentham's well-known phrase, \\"the greatest happiness for the greatest number\\". Jeremy Bentham supported his theory with another famous quote of his, that \\"Nature has placed mankind under two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as determine what we shall do.\\" Bentham's utilitarianism is a hedonistic theory and starts with the premise that people are in their very nature hedonistic. This means that he believed people would actively seek out pleasure and avoid pain, if given the opportunity. Critics sometimes cite such prohibitions on leisure activities as a problem for act utilitarianism. Critics also cite more significant problems, such as the fact that act utilitarianism seems to imply that specific acts of torture or enslavement would be morally permissible if they produced enough happiness. Act utilitarianism is often contrasted with a different theory called rule utilitarianism. Rule utilitarianism states that the morally right action is the one that is in accordance with a moral rule whose general observance would create the most happiness. Act utilitarianism evaluates an act by its actual consequences whereas rule utilitarianism evaluates an action by the consequences of its general or universal practice (by all other persons, and perhaps into the future and past as well). Rule utilitarianism is sometimes thought to avoid the problems associated with act utilitarianism.Lyons, David. Forms and Limits of Utilitarianism. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1965, p. vii.

C: anticlinal or eclipsed. D: synperiplanar or cis. There are both steric and electronic effects that affect the relative stability of conformers. Ordinarily, steric effects predominate to place large substituents far from each other. However, this is not the case for certain substituents, typically those that are highly electronegative. Instead, there is an electronic preference for these groups to be gauche. Typically studied examples include 1,2-difluoroethane (H2FCCFH2), ethylene glycol, and vicinal-difluoroalkyl structures. :Gauche effect in 1,2-difluoroethane, left: anti and right: gauche Hyperconjugation model for explaining the gauche effect in 1,2-difluoroethane There are two main explanations for the gauche effect: hyperconjugation and bent bonds. In the hyperconjugation model, the donation of electron density from the C‚ÄìH œÉ bonding orbital to the C‚ÄìF œÉ* antibonding orbital is considered the source of stabilization in the gauche isomer. Due to the greater electronegativity of fluorine, the C‚ÄìH œÉ orbital is a better electron donor than the C‚ÄìF œÉ orbital, while the C‚ÄìF œÉ* orbital is a better electron acceptor than the C‚ÄìH œÉ* orbital. Only the gauche conformation allows good overlap between the better donor and the better acceptor. Key in the bent bond explanation of the gauche effect in difluoroethane is the increased p orbital character of both C‚ÄìF bonds due to the large electronegativity of fluorine. As a result, electron density builds up above and below to the left and right of the central C‚ÄìC bond. The resulting reduced orbital overlap can be partially compensated when a gauche conformation is assumed, forming a bent bond. Of these two models, hyperconjugation is generally considered the principal cause behind the gauche effect in difluoroethane.Goodman, L.; Gu, H.; Pophristic, V.. Gauche Effect in 1,2-Difluoroethane. Hyperconjugation, Bent Bonds, Steric Repulsion. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2005, 109, 1223‚Äì1229. David O'Hagan. Understanding organofluorine chemistry. An introduction to the C‚ÄìF bond. Chem. Soc. Rev. 2008 The molecular geometry of both rotamers can be obtained experimentally by high resolution infrared spectroscopy augmented with in silico work. In accordance with the model described above, the carbon‚Äìcarbon bond length is higher for the anti-rotamer (151.4 pm vs. 150). The steric repulsion between the fluorine atoms in the gauche rotamer causes increased CCF bond angles (by 3.2¬∞) and increased FCCF dihedral angles (from the default 60¬∞ to 71¬∞). In the related compound 1,2-difluoro-1,2-diphenylethane, the threo isomer is found (by X-ray diffraction and from NMR coupling constants) to have an anti conformation between the two phenyl groups and the two fluorine groups and a gauche conformation is found for both groups for the erythro isomer.The vicinal difluoro motif: The synthesis and conformation of erythro- and threo- diastereoisomers of 1,2-difluorodiphenylethanes, 2,3-difluorosuccinic acids and their derivatives O'Hagan D, Rzepa H, Schuler M, Slawin A Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry, 2006 2:19 ( 2 October 2006 ) According to in silico results this conformation is more stable by 0.21 kcal/mol (880 J/mol). A gauche effect has also been reported for a molecule featuring an all-syn array of four consecutive fluoro substituents. The reaction to install the fourth one is stereoselective:Enantioselective Synthesis of an All-syn Four Vicinal Fluorine Motif Luke Hunter, David O'Hagan, and Alexandra M. Z. Slawin J. Am. Chem.

The alkene cis effect is an analogous atypical stabilizing of certain alkenes.  External influences  The gauche effect is very sensitive to solvent effects, due to the large difference in polarity between the two conformers. For example, 2,3-dinitro-2,3-dimetylbutane, which in the solid state exists only in the gauche conformation, prefers the gauche conformer in benzene solution by a ratio of 79:21, but in carbon tetrachloride it prefers the anti conformer by a ratio of 58:42.Smith, Michael. B.; March, J. March's Advanced Organic Chemistry, 5th edition. Wiley, 2001. Another case is trans-1,2 difluorocyclohexane, which has a larger preference for the di-equatorial conformer, rather than the anti-diaxial conformer, in more polar solvents.

Projects are also planned for meeting future fuel quality requirements. Barauni Refinery was built in collaboration with Russia and Romania. Situated from Patna, it was built with an initial cost of Rs 49.40 crore. Barauni Refinery was commissioned in 1964 with a refining capacity of 1 million tonnes per year and it was dedicated to the Nation by the then Union Minister for Petroleum, Prof. Humayun Kabir in January 1965. After de-bottlenecking, revamping and expansion project, its capacity today is 6 million tonnes per year. Matching secondary processing facilities such Residue Fluidized Catalytic Cracker (RFCC), Diesel Hydro treating (DHDT), Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU) have been added. These state of the art eco-friendly technologies have enabled the refinery to produce environment- friendly green fuels complying with international standards. Barauni Refinery was initially designed to process low sulphur crude oil (sweet crude) of Assam. After establishment of other refineries in the Northeast, Assam crude is unavailable for Barauni . Hence, sweet crude is being sourced from African, South East Asian and Middle East countries like Nigeria, Iraq and Malaysia. The refinery receives crude oil by pipeline from Paradip on the east coast via Haldia. With various revamps and expansion projects at Barauni Refinery, capability for processing high-sulphur crude has been added ‚Äî high-sulphur crude oil (sour crude) is cheaper than low-sulphur crudes ‚Äî thereby increasing not only the capacity but also the profitability of the refinery.

It is the second largest refinery owned by Indian Oil Corporation after Panipat Refinery. The refinery is currently under projected expansion to 18 million tonnes per year. History Following the conclusion of the Indo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation in February 1961, a site for the establishment of a 2 million tonnes per year oil refinery was selected on 17 April 1961. Soviet and Indian engineers signed a contract in October 1961 for the preparation of the project. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru laid the foundation stone of the refinery on 10 May 1963. The refinery was commissioned with Soviet assistance at a cost of Rs.26 crores began production in October 1965. The first crude distillation unit with a capacity of 1 million tonnes per year was commissioned for trial production on 11 October 1965 and achieved its rated capacity on 6 December 1965. Throughput reached 20% beyond its designed capacity in January 1966. President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan dedicated the refinery to the nation with the commissioning of second crude distillation unit and catalytic reforming unit on 18 October 1966. The third 1 million tonnes per year distillation unit was commissioned in September 1967 to process Ankleshwar and North Gujarat crudes. In December 1968, Udex plant was commissioned for production of benzene and toluene using feedstock from CRU. By 1974-75 with in-house modifications, the capacity of the refinery increased by 40% to a level of 4.2 million tonnes per year. To process imported crude the refinery was expanded during 1978-79 by adding another 3 million tonnes per year crude distillation unit along with downstream processing units including vacuum distillation, visbreaker and bitumen blowing units. By 1980-81 this unit started processing Bombay High crude in addition to imported crudes. It was the first time that Indian engineers independently handled a project of that scale. To recover products from the residue, secondary processing facilities consisting of fluidized catalytic cracking unit of 1 million tonnes per year capacity along with a feed preparation unit of 1 million tonnes per year capacities, were commissioned in December 1982. The refinery set up pilot distillation facilities for the production of n-Heptane and light aluminum rolling oils. To enable absorption of increased indigenous crudes the refinery's capacity was further increased to 9.5 million tonnes per year. In 1993-1994, Gujarat commissioned the country's first hydrocracker unit of 1.2 million tonnes per year along with feed preparation unit-2 and hydrogen generation unit-1 (GHC Complex), for conversion of heavier ends of crude oil to high value superior products. India's first diesel hydrodesulfurisation unit to reduce sulfur content in diesel was commissioned in June 1999. A methyl tertiary butyl ether unit was commissioned in September 1999 to eliminate lead from motor fuels. The facility conceptualised and commissioned South Asia's largest centralised effluent treatment plant by dismantling the four old ETP's (Effluent Treatment Plant) in June 1999. By September 1999 with the commissioning of an atmospheric distillation unit, Gujarat Refinery further augmented its capacity to 13.7 million tonnes per year making it the largest public sector undertaking refinery of the country. A project for production of linear alkyl benzene from kerosene streams was implemented in August 2004. It is the largest grassroots single train Kerosene-to-LAB unit in the world, with an installed capacity of 1.2 million tonnes per year. To meet future fuel quality requirements, MS quality improvement facilities were commissioned in 2006. The Residue Upgaration Project undertaken by the Gujarat Refinery was completed by 2011 which increased the high sulfur processing capacity of Gujarat refinery, improved the distillate yield as well produce BS III & IV quality of MS and HSD. The Residue upgradation project came in two parts namely, the south block which consisted of HGU-III, SRU-III, DHDT and ISOM units and the north block consisted of VGO-HDT and DCU units. To support the new units a new Co- Generation Plant (CGP) and Heat Recovery Steam Generation (HRSG) were also commissioned. Description The refinery's facilities include five atmospheric crude distillation units. The major secondary units include Catalytic Reforming Unit (CRU), Fluidized Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCCU)and the first hydrocracking unit of the country. Through a pipeline to Ahmedabad and a pipeline connecting to the BKPL (Barauni-Kanpur Pipeline) pipeline and also by rail and truck, the refinery primarily serves the demand for petroleum products in western and northern India. When commissioned, the refinery had an installed capacity of 2 million tonnes per year and was designed to process crude from Ankleshwar, Kalol and Nawagam oilfields of ONGC in Gujarat. The refinery was modified to handle imported and Bombay High crude. The refinery also produces a wide range of specialty products such as benzene, toluene, MTO, food grade hexane, solvents and LABFS. The Gujarat Refinery is the first refinery in India to have completed the diesel hydrodesulfurization project in June 1999, when the refinery started production of HSD with low sulfur content of 0.25% wt (max).

The term was initially used for a low Mach number approach (Expansion of the acoustic perturbation field about an incompressible flow) as it is described under EIF. Later in the beginning 1990s the growing CAA community picked up the term and extensively used it for any kind of numerical method describing the noise radiation from an aeroacoustic source or the propagation of sound waves in an inhomogeneous flow field. Such numerical methods can be far field integration methods (e.g. FW- HFfowcs Williams, \\"The Noise from Turbulence Convected at High Speed\\", Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, Vol. A255, 1963, pp. 496-503Ffowcs Williams, J. E., and Hawkings, D. L., \\"Sound Generated by Turbulence and Surfaces in Arbitrary Motion\\", Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, Vol. A264, 1969, pp. 321-342) as well as direct numerical methods optimized for the solutions (e.g.C. K. W. Tam, and J. C. Webb, \\"Dispersion-Relation-Preserving Finite Difference Schemes for Computational Acoustics\\", Journal of Computational Physics, Vol. 107, 1993, pp. 262-281) of a mathematical model describing the aerodynamic noise generation and/or propagation. With the rapid development of the computational resources this field has undergone spectacular progress during the last three decades. Methods Direct numerical simulation (DNS) approach to CAA The compressible Navier-Stokes equation describes both the flow field, and the aerodynamically generated acoustic field. Thus both may be solved for directly. This requires very high numerical resolution due to the large differences in the length scale present between the acoustic variables and the flow variables. It is computationally very demanding and unsuitable for any commercial use. Hybrid approach In this approach the computational domain is split into different regions, such that the governing acoustic or flow field can be solved with different equations and numerical techniques. This would involve using two different numerical solvers, first a dedicated Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool and secondly an acoustic solver. The flow field is then used to calculate the acoustical sources. Both steady state (RANS, SNGR (Stochastic Noise Generation and Radiation), ...) and transient (DNS, LES, DES, URANS, ...) fluid field solutions can be used. These acoustical sources are provided to the second solver which calculates the acoustical propagation. Acoustic propagation can be calculated using one of the following methods: # Integral methods ## Lighthill's analogy ## Kirchhoff integral ## FW-H # LEE # Pseudospectral # EIF # APE =Integral methods= There are multiple methods, which are based on a known solution of the acoustic wave equation to compute the acoustic far field of a sound source. Because a general solution for wave propagation in the free space can be written as an integral over all sources, these solutions are summarized as integral methods. The acoustic sources have to be known from some different source (e.g. a Finite Element simulation of a moving mechanical system or a fluid dynamic CFD simulation of the sources in a moving medium). The integral is taken over all sources at the retarded time (source time), which is the time at that the source is sent out the signal, which arrives now at a given observer position. Common to all integral methods is, that they cannot account for changes in the speed of sound or the average flow speed between source and observer position as they use a theoretical solution of the wave equation. When applying Lighthill's theory Lighthill, M. J., \\"On Sound Generated Aerodynamically, i\\", Proc. Roy. Soc. A, Vol. 211, 1952, pp 564-587Lighthill, M. J., \\"On Sound Generated Aerodynamically, ii\\", Proc. Roy. Soc. A, Vol. 222, 1954, pp 1-32 to the Navier Stokes equations of Fluid mechanics, one obtains volumetric sources, whereas the other two analogies provide the far field information based on a surface integral. Acoustic analogies can be very efficient and fast, as the known solution of the wave equation is used. One far away observer takes as long as one very close observer. Common for the application of all analogies is the integration over a large number of contributions, which can lead to additional numerical problems (addition/subtraction of many large numbers with result close to zero.) Furthermore, when applying an integral method, usually the source domain is limited somehow. While in theory the sources outside have to be zero, the application can not always fulfill this condition. Especially in connection with CFD simulations, this leads to large cut-off errors. By damping the source gradually to zero at the exit of the domain or adding some additional terms to correct this end-effect, these cut-off errors can be minimized. Lighthill's analogy Also called 'Acoustic Analogy'. To obtain Lighthill's aeroacoustic analogy the governing Navier-Stokes equations are rearranged. The left hand side is a wave operator, which is applied to the density perturbation or pressure perturbation respectively. The right hand side is identified as the acoustic sources in a fluid flow, then. As Lighthill's analogy follows directly from the Navier-Stokes equations without simplification, all sources are present. Some of the sources are then identified as turbulent or laminar noise. The far-field sound pressure is then given in terms of a volume integral over the domain containing the sound source. The source term always includes physical sources and such sources, which describe the propagation in an inhomogeneous medium. The wave operator of Lighthill's analogy is limited to constant flow conditions outside the source zone. No variation of density, speed of sound and Mach number is allowed. Different mean flow conditions are identified as strong sources with opposite sign by the analogy, once an acoustic wave passes it. Part of the acoustic wave is removed by one source and a new wave is radiated to fix the different wave speed. This often leads very large volumes with strong sources. Several modifications to Lighthill's original theory have been proposed to account for the sound-flow interaction or other effects. To improve Lighthill's analogy different quantities inside the wave operator as well as different wave operators are considered by following analogies. All of them obtain modified source terms, which sometimes allow a more clear sight on the \\"real\\" sources. The acoustic analogies of Lilley,Lilley, G. M., \\"On the noise from air jets\\",AGARD CP 131, 13.1-13.12 Pierce,Pierce, A. D., \\"Wave equation for the sound in fluids with unsteady inhomogeneous flow\\", J. Acoust. Soc.

A well posed acoustic analogy based on a moving acoustic medium. 2010, arXiv preprint arXiv:1009.3766. are only some examples for aeroacoustic analogies based on Lighthill's ideas. All acoustic analogies require a volume integration over a source term. The major difficulty with the acoustic analogy, however, is that the sound source is not compact in supersonic flow. Errors could be encountered in calculating the sound field, unless the computational domain could be extended in the downstream direction beyond the location where the sound source has completely decayed. Furthermore, an accurate account of the retarded time-effect requires keeping a long record of the time-history of the converged solutions of the sound source, which again represents a storage problem. For realistic problems, the required storage can reach the order of 1 terabyte of data. Kirchhoff integral Kirchhoff and Helmholtz showed, that the radiation of sound from a limited source region can be described by enclosing this source region by a control surface - the so-called Kirchhoff surface. Then the sound field inside or outside the surface, where no sources are allowed and the wave operator on the left hand side applies, can be produced as a superposition of monopoles and dipoles on the surface. The theory follows directly from the wave equation. The source strength of monopoles and dipoles on the surface can be calculated if the normal velocity (for monopoles) and the pressure (for dipoles) on the surface are known respectively. A modification of the method allows even to calculate the pressure on the surface based on the normal velocity only. The normal velocity could be given by a FE-simulation of a moving structure for instance. However, the modification to avid the acoustic pressure on the surface to be known leads to problems, when considering an enclosed volume at its resonant frequencies, which is a major issue of the implementations of their method. The Kirchhoff integral method finds for instance application in Boundary element methods (BEM). A non-zero flow velocity is accounted by considering a moving frame of reference with the outer flow speed, in which the acoustic wave propagation takes place. Repetitive applications of the method can account for obstacles. First the sound field on the surface of the obstacle is calculated and then the obstacle is introduced by adding sources on its surface to cancel the normal velocity on the surface of the obstacle. Variations of the average flow field (speed of sound, density and velocity) can be taken into account by a similar method (e.g. dual reciprocity BEM). FW-H The integration method of Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings is based on Lighthill's acoustic analogy. However, by some mathematical modifications under the assumption of a limited source region, which is enclosed by a control surface (FW-H surface), the volume integral is avoided. Surface integrals over monopole and dipole sources remain. Different from the Kirchhoff method, these sources follow directly from the Navier-Stokes equations through Lighthill's analogy. Sources outside the FW-H surface can be accounted by an additional volume integral over quadrupole sources following from the Lighthill Tensor. However, when considering the same assumptions as Kirchhoffs linear theory, the FW-H method equals the Kirchhoff method. =Linearized Euler Equations= Considering small disturbances superimposed on a uniform mean flow of density \\\\rho_0, pressure p_0 and velocity on x-axis u_0, the Euler equations for a two dimensional model is presented as: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{U}}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{F}}{\\\\partial x} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{G}}{\\\\partial y} = \\\\mathbf{S}, where : \\\\mathbf{U} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\rho \\\\\\\\\\\\ u \\\\\\\\\\\\ v \\\\\\\\\\\\ p \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\ , \\\\ \\\\mathbf{F} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\rho_0 u + \\\\rho u_0\\\\\\\\\\\\ u_0 u + p/\\\\rho_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ u_0 v \\\\\\\\\\\\ u_0 p + \\\\gamma p_0 u \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\ , \\\\ \\\\mathbf{G} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\rho_0 v\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ p/\\\\rho_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\gamma p_0 v \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}, where \\\\rho, u, v and p are the acoustic field variables, \\\\gamma the ratio of specific heats c_p/c_v, for air at 20 ¬∞C c_p/c_v = 1.4, and the source term \\\\mathbf{S} on the right-side represents distributed unsteady sources. The application of LEE can be found in engine noise studies.X. X. Chen, X. Huang and X. Zhang, \\"Sound Radiation from a Bypass Duct with Bifurcations\\", AIAA Journal, Vol. 47, No. 2, 2009. pp.429-436. For high Mach number flows in compressible regimes, the acoustic propagation may be influenced by non-linearities and the LEE may no longer be the appropriate mathematical model. =Pseudospectral= A Fourier pseudospectral time-domain method can be applied to wave propagation problems pertinent to computational aeroacoustics. The original algorithm of the Fourier pseudo spectral time domain method works for periodical problems without the interaction with physical boundaries. A slip wall boundary condition, combined with buffer zone technique to solve some non-periodical aeroacoustic problems has been proposed.X. Huang and X. Zhang, \\"A Fourier Pseudospectral Method for Some Computational Aeroacoustics Problems\\", International Journal of Aeroacoustics, Vol 5, No 3, 2006. pp.279-294.

Los Sanchez is one of two Mexican versions of the Argentine telenovela Los Roldan; the other version being Una Familia Con Suerte.https://www.nacion.com/viva/television/salma- hayek-producira-version-de-em-los-roldan-em/NPBVNCF5VVGHRKMGKMYH2ROMTQ/story/ Plot Along the four seasons the Mexican audience knew about Tito S√°nchez and his family, a very traditional Mexican family that suddenly becomes rich, when Mercedes Lozada, one of the richest women of Mexico, meets Tito S√°nchez when she's trying to commit suicide and he saves her life, she is sick (cancer) and she's gonna die soon, so she thanks him and names him as the President of her company Lozada Corporation. S√°nchez lives with his sister in law, Yoli (Martha Mariana Castro) who is deeply in love with him but she's kept that as secret for so many years. Yoli's sister, so Tito's wife, died 6 years ago so Yoli helps Tito with his children: Leo, Hilda, Mar√≠a and Maxi and treats them as if they were her own kids. Tito also lives with his brother Ra√∫l (better known as Laisa Libertad) who is homosexual and is always dressed as a woman, he also acts that way. First season When Tito and his family get rich, they move to a very nice house, they meet then their neighbours, the Uriarte family, they are Emilio (Alejandro Bracho), Charito (Leticia Huijara) and Facundo (Leo Rey). They always try to make Los S√°nchez life impossible, but Emilio falls in love with Laisa, he's the only one who doesn't notice that Laisa is not a woman. Charito falls in love with Omar (Mar√≠a's boyfriend, he's considered as part of the S√°nchez family and he's younger than Charito) and Facundo is in love with Hilda, one of Tito's daughter. Tito meets Cecilia (Martha Christiana), a beautiful, elegant and smart woman and falls in love with her, Yoli gets very sad because Tito starts to prefer Cecilia and doesn't realize what Yoli feels, so Yoli decides to confess her feelings and tells Tito that she's in love with him, with no answer from his part... Trying to forget, Yoli lives a romance with Paul Manzini (Luis Miguel Lombana) who is Emilio's best friend, he loves Yoli but after a month she ends that relationship for she can't forget Tito, finally Tito ends his relationship with Cecilia and gives a chance to Yoli, even when he's still in love with Cecilia. The first season ends with the cancellation of Yoli and Tito's wedding, after Cecilia leaves pregnant, Cecilia never comes back again but Yoli doesn't want to marry Tito because she doesn't want him to suffer. Second season The story goes its way on the second season but at the end some characters don't appear anymore: Paul Manzini, Charito, Emilio and Facundo are some of them, this season ends with Tito and Yoli's wedding, when he finally accepts that he loves her and she tells him that she's pregnant. Third season The third season comes with a lot of fantasy on it, an angel that takes care of the family, new characters that don't catch the audience's attention anymore, so after a great success Los S√°nchez ends with the traditional happy ending.

This versatile refinery which is the first of India's modern refineries, symbolizes the country's industrial strength and progress in the oil industry. Mumbai Refinery has grown over the years as the main hub of petroleum products. The refinery has reached to present level through several upgradation and restructuring processes. History The Mumbai Refinery was commissioned by Esso Standard in 1954, with an installed capacity of 1.25 million tonnes per year. Lube refinery, Lube India Ltd, was commissioned in 1969 with a capacity of 165 million tonnes per year of Lube Oil Base Stock (LOBS) production Crude processing capacity increased to 3.5 million tonnes per year during 1969. In 1974, the Government of India took over Esso and Lube India by the Esso (Acquisition of Undertakings in India) Act 1974 and formed HPCL. Expansion of fuels block was carried out by installation of new 2 million tonnes per year crude units in 1985. Second expansion of Lube Refinery took place to increase the capacity of the refinery to 335 million tonnes per year, so far the largest in India. The installed capacity of the refinery was later enhanced to 6.5 million tonnes per year.

This was one of the first major industries of Visakhapatnam and first oil refinery on the East Coast. After the nationalisation, HPCL has transformed itself into a mega Public Sector Undertaking and it is second largest integrated oil company in India. History of Visakha refinery Visakha refinery was commissioned by Caltex Oil Refining (India) in 1957, with an installed capacity of 0.675million tonne per year. The facility was acquired by the Government of India in 1976 and amalgamated with HPCL in 1978 by the CORIL-HPCL Amalgamation Order, 1978. The refinery's capacity was increased to 4.5million tonne per year under the first major expansion project in 1985, known as Visakha Refinery Expansion Project-I (VREP-I). Its refining capacity was increased to 7.5million tonne per year under VREP-II in 1999, and again to 8.3million tonne per year in 2010. Visakh Refinery Modernisation Project (VRMP)https://www.hydrocarbons- technology.com/projects/visakh-refinery-modernisation-project-visakhapatnam/  Visakh Refinery Modernisation Project (VRMP) is a brownfield expansion of the Visakh refinery located in Visakhapatnam, India. The project is being executed by the state-owned Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL). VRMP will expand the refining capacity of the Visakh refinery from 8.3million tonne per year to 15million tonne per year, while enabling the production and distribution of Bharat Stage-VI (BS-VI)-compliant fuels. BS VI is a new emission standard that will align India's motor vehicle regulations with European Union (EU) regulations for light-duty passenger cars and commercial vehicles, heavy-duty trucks and buses, and two-wheeled vehicles. The standard is due to be implemented in India from 2020. The VRMP project is estimated to involve an investment of approximately $3.1bn and is scheduled for completion in 2020. Details of Visakh Refinery Modernisation Project HPCL received approval from the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC) for the VRMP in February 2016. The expansion project is being carried out on an area adjacent to the east portion of the existing site. The scope of the project consists of the installation of primary processing units such as a 9million tonne per year crude distillation unit (CDU) replacing one of the three existing CDUs, a 3.3million tonne per year vacuum gas oil hydrocracker and a 290,000 tonne per year naphtha isomerisation unit (NIU). An additional 3.1million tonne per year solvent de-asphalting (SDA) unit, a 2.5million tonne per year slurry hydrocracker unit (SHCU) and a 96t/day propylene recovery unit (PRU) are also outlined in the plans. Other auxiliary units being built under the project include two 113million tonne per year hydrogen generation units (HGUs), two 360t/day sulphur recovery units (SRUs) including tail gas treatment units (TGTUs), and a 36,000 tonne per year fuel gas pressure-swing adsorption (PSA) unit. A 300t/h non-hydro-processing sour-water stripper (SWS-I), a 185t/h hydro-processing sour-water stripper (SWS-II), two 540t/h amine regeneration units (ARUs), a 112,000tonne per year sulphur recovery LPG treating unit will also be installed. The current effluent treatment plants (EFPs) are set to be replaced by a 1,000m¬≥/h integrated effluent treatment plant (IETP). Various existing units, including a naphtha hydro-treating unit, a continuous catalytic reformer and a diesel hydro-treating unit are also being revamped as part of the modernisation. Additionally, a duel fuel-powered captive power plant (CPP) will be built. The project will also involve the construction of a new utility system comprising a re-circulating sea cooling water system consisting of cooling tower cells and water pumps, as well as a demineralised water system featuring a new reverse osmosis (RO) system and water tanks. Technology upgrades at Visakh refinery VRMP will implement Honeywell UOP Penex‚Ñ¢ process technology to produce a high-octane gasoline component called isomerate, and a Unicracking‚Ñ¢ hydrocracking unit to produce cleaner burning diesel fuel. The Penex employs high-activity isomerisation and benzene impregnation catalysts from Honeywell UOP. Unicracking processes use highly effective catalysts to yield higher quantities of cleaner-burning fuels from a range of feedstock. The innovative configuration of the fractionation unit ensures effective separation of the products, while minimising capital costs and operating expenses. The two processes will significantly increase the capability of the refinery to deliver petrol and diesel in compliance with the new BS-VI clean fuels standards. \\"VRMP will expand the refining capacity of the Visakh refinery from 8.3million tonne per year to 15million tonne per year, while enabling the production of Bharat Stage-VI (BS-VI)-compliant fuels.\\" The planned integration of innovative technologies will also enhance gross margins of the refinery by generating high-value transportation fuels from low-value raw materials. VRCFP (Visakh Refinery Clean Fuels Project) This project was implemented by the Projects Department at Visakh Refinery. This project is essentially to produce fuels for environment improvement at an estimated cost of Rs 16352 million with an FE component of Rs 2525 million.

They belong to the parish of San Francisco de Afora, in the municipality of Vigo. They were declared a Nature Reserve in 1980 and are included in the Atlantic Islands of Galicia National Park (Parque Nacional Mar√≠timo-Terrestre das Illas Atl√°nticas de Galicia) created in 2002. The archipelago Looking South from Monte das Figueiras (Monteagudo Island) The C√≠es consist of three islands, Monteagudo (\\"Sharp Mount\\" or North Island), do Faro (\\"Lighthouse Island\\", or Isla do Medio, \\"Middle Island\\") and San Marti√±o (\\"Saint Martin\\" or South Island). Monteagudo is separated from the Morrazo peninsula by the North Canal while San Marti√±o is separated from the coast of Santoulo cape (mount Ferro) by the Freu da Porta Strait. The Do Faro island is linked to the North island by an accumulation of sand long known as Rodas beach, in the eastern side of the island. During high tide the sea flows between the islands in the western side and, blocked by the beach it fills the lagoon between the sandy area and the rocks. The highest peak is the Alto das C√≠es () in Monteagudo. The islands formed by the end of the Tertiary, when some parts of the coast sank, creating the r√≠as (\\"estuaries\\"). All three islands are the peaks of the coastal mountains now partially under the sea and are formed mainly of granitic rock. The land is mountainous with rough, nearly vertical cliffs of more than on the western side, and numerous caves (furnas) formed by erosion from the sea and the wind. The eastern side is less steep, covered by woods and bushes and protected from the Atlantic winds, allowing the formation of beaches and dunes. Atlantic squalls pass over the islands, unloading as they collide with the coast. Therefore, the C√≠es receive more or less half of the rain than the rest of the R√≠as Baixas coast receives. Nature reserve Due to the high natural value of this area and to the deterioration it was suffering by human activity, it was declared a Nature Reserve in 1980. The level of legal protection varied until November 21, 2000, when the Galician Parliament unanimously agreed to apply for the status of National Park to the central Government. The Spanish Congress of Deputies signed a definite agreement in June 2002, creating the National Land-Marine Park of the Atlantic Islands of Galicia, formed by a number of archipelagos, islands and cays, namely the C√≠es, Ons, S√°lvora, , Vionta, Cortegada Island and the . The marine part of the Park is measured as a 100-meter-wide strip from the shore in low tide. Since 1992, underwater fishing is forbidden in the islands. National Parks are nature areas nearly untransformed by human activity that, based on their landscape, geological or ecosystems possess aesthetic, ecologic, educative or scientific values worth of special protection. Therefore, the activities that alter or endanger the stability of the ecosystem are forbidden. Some traditional activities (like traditional fishing) are allowed as long as they are compatible with the environment and the preservation of natural resources. Since 1988, the Islands have a status of ZEPA (Zona de Especial Protecci√≥n para las Aves, Spanish for Special Protection Area for Birds), and they are included in the Natura 2000 network, which develops European Union Directives in relation to habitats and birds. It contains one of the main colonies of the yellow-legged gull. The ZEPAs are protected mainly to avoid pollution and general deterioration of the places used by birds permanently or during their migrations. Tourism In summer, boats link Monteagudo with the ports of Vigo, Baiona and Cangas. There is a camping area but permissions have to be reserved at the Vigo port. A supermarket, a visitor center and a restaurant cater for visitors. There are no waste bins on the islands. Visitors are required to take their litter back to the mainland. The C√≠es Islands are composed of nine beaches with fine white sand and clear waters. In February 2007 the British newspaper The Guardian chose the beach of Rodas, on the island of Monteagudo,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/feb/16/beach.top10 as \\"the best beach in the world.\\" \\"Galegos come here to spend long, lazy summer days on the Praia das Rodas, a perfect crescent of soft, pale sand backed by small dunes sheltering a calm lagoon of crystal-clear sea\\", says the magazine. Flora The scrubland is formed mainly of autochthonous species, like gorse, broom, asparagus, spurge flax (Thymelaea) or rockrose (Cistaceae). The woodland has suffered bigger alterations, since most autochthonous species like the common fig or the pyrenaean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) are now reduced to symbolic representation by the reforestation of nearly one fourth of the surface with pine trees and eucalyptus. On the other hand, the strong winds with a high content in salt act as barrier in the development of the trees. Some rare and representative coastal species do grow in the dunes, beaches and cliffs under very extreme climatic conditions, as the sea pink (Armeria pungens; in galician herba de namorar or \\"love plant\\"), locally endangered, and an important number of camari√±as (galician common name for Corema album), an endemic species from the Iberian Peninsula western coast. Typically marshland flora (like rushes) grow in the area of the lagoon. Fauna There is a large colony of seagulls, about 22,000 pairs, and they are the dominant species in C√≠es. A census in 1960 counted 400 pairs of Iberian guillemots (Uria aalge albionis), a species now almost extinct on the islands. Other species include birds of prey, pigeons, petrels, pelicans, doves, woodpeckers and other types of birds, which nest in trees and cliffs. Also, there are a variety of many types of birds wintering or resting on their migratory journeys here. In the Alto da Campa (Illa do Faro) and in the Faro do Peito (San Marti√±o), there are ornithological observatories. The waters around the islands are rich in biodiversityCeltaia Association. 2015.

H. Richardson. The buildings are considered among the finest examples of the Romanesque Revival style for which Richardson is well known. The complex is bordered by wide thoroughfares named for city founders James Ross (Ross Street), John Forbes (Forbes Avenue) and James Grant (Grant Street). The current building, completed in 1888, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. Richardson later referred to it as his \\"great achievement\\".https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat;=19360114&id;=A7pRAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=i2kDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=2096,4578811&hl;=en  Early structures Second Courthouse, Pittsburgh, in 1857. This courthouse was ruined by fire in 1882. Pittsburgh's original courthouse, first occupied in 1794, was a wooden structure located on one side of Market Square. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court and from December 7, 1818, until 1841 the Western District of Pennsylvania also held court sessions at Market Square. Land for a new courthouse was purchased in April 1834. This was a tract of land on the corner of Forbes Avenue and Grant Street, on Grant's Hill. Construction took place between 1836 and 1840. This court house was built with polished gray sandstone, quarried at Coal Hill (present-day Mount Washington), opposite Water Street along the Monongahela River. The building was designed by John Chislett. The Greek Revival design included a domed cupola housing a rotunda in diameter and high. The building was completed in 1841. The building's second floor again served as the headquarters for both the Commonwealth Supreme Court Pittsburgh region and the Federal Western District, serving the latter until a new U.S. Customs House/Post Office opened on Fifth and Smithfield in 1853. Due to corrosion caused by coal smoke, the building deteriorated: the dressed surface of the facade dropped off, some of the cornices near the roof began to fall, and the building had a scaly appearance. Even in its deteriorated state, it was a handsome structure. On May 7, 1882, a fire broke out and ruined the building. Subsequently, it was demolished. The third, and present, courthouse was erected on the same spot.\\"A century and a half of Pittsburg and her people,\\" Boucher, John Newton; The Lewis Publishing Company, 1908, prgs. 371, 372  Current structure Following the destruction of the second courthouse, Allegheny County Commissioners decided to hold a competition to design a replacement. The winner of the competition was Boston architect Henry Hobson Richardson and construction of the buildings was begun by the Norcross Brothers, Richardson's construction firm of choice, in 1884. The cornerstone for the building was laid on October 13, 1884. The design of the main building, which Richardson considered to be his finest, was innovative in that the building is built around an interior courtyard, thus allowing natural light and fresh air to reach most of the building. The courtyard is surrounded by four stories in three sides. A tower rises five stories from the courtyard's open side. As was usually the case with Richardson's buildings, the roof is steep with dormers placed at all the corners. A prison is connected to the courthouse via the \\"Bridge of Sighs\\". The design was based on the Bridge of Sighs in Venice. The entire complex was built of large rusticated blocks of granite, with the entrance ways and windows topped with wide arches. This gives the building a heavy, stable and dignified appearance. In the 1900s the street level in front of the building was lowered as part of a general re-grading of Pittsburgh.Helen Clay Frick Foundation Archives, 1892-1987, AIS.2002.06, Archives Service Center, University of Pittsburgh.Series XV. Hump Removal, 1899-1914: Biography/History. Richardson had anticipated this and courses of finished masonry had been buried underground, now to be revealed. Unfortunately this left the ceremonial entrance a full story above the street. A grand stairway was built, but removed during street widening in the 1930s- the low arched doorways were extended downwards to street level, with the result that the visitor is not greeted by the grand entrance hall Richardson planned, but by the low corridors which were once the basement. Muralist Vincent Nesbert completed five murals for the building on its first floor in 1937: \\"Industry,\\" \\"Justice,\\" \\"Peace,\\" \\"Fort Duquesne\\" and \\"The Battle of Grant's Hill.\\" In 1973, the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1976, it was designated a National Historic Landmark. Legacy and impact The design of the Allegheny County Courthouse has influenced buildings in many cities across North America, such as Toronto City Hall, Minneapolis City Hall, the Milwaukee Federal Building, Altgeld Hall on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign and James W. McLaughlin's Wayne County Courthouse in Richmond, Indiana. In 2007, the American Institute of Architects asked Harris Interactive to survey 2,000 people, who were shown 247 photographs of buildings and other structures in different categories chosen by 2,500 architects. The Allegheny County Courthouse was ranked 35th overall on the list and above every other courthouse in the nation except the United States Supreme Court Building. In popular culture Several big-budget films have portrayed the Courthouse. Striking Distance and Hoffa primarily used interior shots, while Desperate Measures and The Next Three Days used both interior and exterior shots, with Boys on the Side and Mrs. Soffel featuring the Ross Street side of the complex and the \\"Bridge of Sighs\\".

His catchphrases are \\"Don't panic!\\", \\"Permission to speak, sir?\\" and \\"They don't like it up 'em!\\". Jones also often recounts his past military experiences particularly those in Sudan and India and gives a glimpse to the military traditions and events in the concluding years of the 19th century. Fictional biography The backstory invented for Jones suggests that he was born in 1870 in Walmington-on-Sea, the son of George Jones, who by the start of World War II is the 88-year-old caretaker of the Peabody Museum of Historical Army Weapons. In \\"The Showing Up of Corporal Jones\\", when Major Regan asks him his age, Jones replies sixty, but tells Captain Mainwaring later in the same episode his actual age, which is seventy. Jack Jones joined the army as a drummer boy in 1884; thereafter, he served in five military campaigns ‚Äì the Gordon Relief Expedition to the Sudan (1884‚Äì1885), the Anglo-Egyptian Reconquest of the Sudan (1896‚Äì1899), the Boer War (1899‚Äì1901) and the First World War (1914‚Äì1918) (declaring in \\"The Deadly Attachment\\" that, \\"I haven't had this much fun since I was in the trenches in 1915!\\"). Occasionally he mentions fighting the Pathans on the North-West Frontier (his medal ribbons imply service on the Frontier in 1895-98Ribbon for the India Medal, 1895‚Äì1902 and 1908Ribbon for the India General Service Medal, 1909). In the episode \\"The Two and a Half Feathers\\" he mentions that he served in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, while in \\"The Bullet Is Not for Firing\\" he startles his khaki clad colleagues by appearing at a court of enquiry in the pre-1914 scarlet and blue full dress uniform of the regiment, complete with two rows of medals. During his service on the Western Front, he says that he was known as the Mad Bomber, due to his inclination to throw grenades madly. He was invalided out of the army in 1915 because of his poor eyesight.In the 1968 pilot episode \\"The Man and the Hour\\", Jones informs Mainwaring that he \\"left the army in 1915, I was invalided out - the old lenses, I couldn't quite focus\\". He also claims that he once formed part of a Guard of Honour for Queen Victoria. During the episode \\"Battle of the Giants!\\" Jones gets an attack of malaria, which he probably picked up during his service in Africa. Despite his advanced age, Jones reveals that both his parents are still alive and well. It is also stated in the episode \\"Room at the Bottom\\", that Jones is a member of the Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Jones was working as the town butcher. (The address of his shop was mentioned in the episode \\"A Brush with the Law\\" as being 19 High Street, Walmington-on-Sea.) He was so keen to join the Local Defence Volunteers that, despite his age (70), Captain Mainwaring instantly appointed him as the platoon's lance corporal. However, it is suggested that Jones' ability to provide off-the-ration meat may have had rather more to do with this decision than his physical and mental abilities, which were declining somewhat due to his age. His vision, for example, was so poor that when signing up for duty, he initially signed the table instead of the form. In many episodes, Jones fondly recalls his participation in the Battle of Omdurman in the Sudan, facing the \\"Fuzzy Wuzzies\\" under the command of General Kitchener. As an aged veteran, he is extremely fond of bayonet warfare (\\"the cold steel\\"), and usually meets any queries about this with the assertion that \\"they don't like it up 'em!\\", a phrase which writer Jimmy Perry remembered an old campaigner using, during his own service in the Home Guard. It is also noted that Jones once kept wicket behind the great cricketer Ranjitsinhji, who was \\"an Indian gentleman and upstanding man\\" until he \\"whipped his bails off\\". It is a bit of a puzzle on how old Jones is. In the fifth episode of series one (The Showing Up of Corporal Jones), he says that he is sixty years old. Yet later in the same episode, he says that he is seventy. But in the last episode of series four (Fallen Idol), he says that he is not sixty yet. Yet Walker says that due to all of the military activity Jones keeps claiming that he took part in, he must be over ninety. Character traits Jones is known for a number of eccentric traits, such as using long, rambling explanations and anecdotes whenever he wants to make a point. He is also invariably one step behind the rest of the platoon in any drill manoeuvre. This is apparently a trait he has had throughout his military career; a fellow veteran, named George Clarke, remembered Jones by this trait in the series 4 episode \\"The Two And A Half Feathers.\\" Only twice was Jones witnessed to be in step with the platoon, once after a whole year's practice; but he quickly reverted to form. The next time was when the whole platoon took the extra second Jones always does to respond to make them look orderly. He often makes far-fetched suggestions, such as advising that they chop off the German prisoners' trouser buttons, on the grounds that if they escaped, a group of men walking through the town with their trousers around their ankles might cause people to \\"raise some inquiries\\". Every time, Jones' suggestions are soundly refuted by Mainwaring with a curt \\"I think you're wandering into the realms of fantasy, Jones.\\" Jones is notably brave, eagerly volunteering for even the most suicidal of missions: for example, when the platoon was discussing torture, he declared loudly and excitedly that the platoon should torture him to see what they were up against. In this instance he failed to calm down when grabbed by other members of the platoon, only returning to normal after being slapped by Frazer. Jones uses odd turns of phrase such as \\"It would be more tasty for us to tell him\\" (instead of \\"tasteful\\"), and \\"I would go through fire and brimstone and treacle for you, sir\\". Despite his advanced years and physical failings, Jones is extremely excitable and active. Whenever action or danger is imminent he becomes near-hysterical and runs around frantically shouting, \\"Don't panic! DON'T PANIC!\\" at the top of his voice (usually at some inappropriate moment, such as when holding an armed landmine or hand grenade) until someone manages to calm him down to a state in which he is useful. This is often not evidence of fear, however, but of extreme eagerness: a courageous man, Jones is always the first to volunteer for any activity (regardless of any potential danger) and is extremely keen when doing so: he is known to sulk if someone else is chosen (the one time he didn't volunteer, Frazer accused him of only volunteering to impress Captain Mainwaring - who wasn't with them - and infuriated Jones into volunteering after all). If awoken suddenly from sleep, or if someone tries to take his bayonet, Jones will attempt to strangle the culprit, for which he profusely apologises afterwards. Tom Courtenay in the role of Corporal Jones in the 2016 Dad's Army film. In one episode, The Two and a Half Feathers Jones has to confront his past when a former comrade from the Sudan, Private Clarke, joins the Walmington-on-Sea platoon. Clarke accuses Jones of leaving him to die, following an incident many years before in which both men were attacked and kidnapped by dervishes. After his courage is doubted by the town and the platoon, Jones later vindicates himself with the true story of what happened (which he had nobly held back to spare a third party unnecessary pain or scandal). After Jones reveals the truth, Clarke later flees without explanation, leaving Jones' honour and respect intact. The platoon uses Jones' delivery van as transport and improvised IFV for their manoeuvres. Jones is very proud of his van, and is often reluctant to allow various modifications needed for the platoon's activities. The instances when Mainwaring causes the van to get damaged are the very rare occasions when Jones becomes upset with the captain, at one point threatening to blacklist Mainwaring from his sausage list; to which Mainwaring replied carefully \\"Steady Jones\\". However Mainwaring generally dismisses the matter, insisting \\"There's a war on!\\". As well as keeping Mainwaring and Wilson buttered up with bribes of meat, Jones often does the same with various other townsfolk when needed. His assistant in the shop is \\" my boy Raymonde\\", with the accent on the \\"e\\". Relationships Jones appears to have reasonably good relationships with both Mainwaring and Wilson, whom he often bribes with meat when he wants his own way. Although Jones' over-keen and sometimes bungled efforts sometimes annoy Mainwaring, the captain is nonetheless admiring of his ever-enthusiastic approach, and considers him one of his best men, often discussing matters with him and Wilson before addressing the rest of the platoon. In an episode where an unexploded bomb is stuck at the top of a telegraph pole after an air raid, Jones volunteers to climb up and retrieve it, causing Mainwaring to say that Jones is \\"brave as a lion, if every one of our men were like him no one could stop us.\\" His relationship with Mainwaring is also doubtlessly improved by Jones' tendency to flatter his superior officer and remains steadfastly loyal to him. However, there have been few occasions where Jones has shown doubt and even mistrust towards Mainwaring. Notably in the episode \\"The King was in His Counting House\\", Jones disdains Mainwaring's claim that his father was a renowned tailor and member of \\"The Master Tailors' Guild\\", by revealing that Mainwaring's father merely owned a \\"poky little drapery shop up a side alley\\" and sold poor-quality workman's trousers. His main rivalries are with Frazer, and the Verger, whom he often calls a troublemaker. On informal occasions, Jones is often accompanied by Mrs Fox, his love-interest. Mrs Fox is a busty middle-aged widow, and a regular customer at Jones' butcher's shop. He has also been known to court the attention of Mrs. Prosser on occasion. In the final episode Jones and Mrs. Fox get married. Military service Jones is seen throughout the series wearing his ribbon bars which recognise his previous service in the British Army.

The hill is considered to be among the largest monolith hills in Asia. The hill rises to 1226 m above mean sea level and forms a part of the Deccan plateau. It consists of peninsular gneiss, granites, basic dykes and laterites. The Arkavathi river passes nearby through the Thippagondanahalli reservoir and on towards Manchanabele dam. The Savandurga hills are frequented by pilgrims who come to visit the Savandi Veerabhadreshwara Swamy and Narasimha Swamy temple situated at the foothills. Rock climbers, cave explorers and adventurers are among others who frequent the locale. Nearby Manchanabele Dam is a nice place for water sports. Origin of name Savandurga is formed by two hills known locally as Karigudda (black hill) and Biligudda (white hill). The earliest record of the name of the hill is from 1340 AD by Hoysala Ballala III from Madabalu where it is called Savandi. Another view is that the name is originated from Samantadurga attributed to a Samantharaya, a governor under Ahchutaraya at Magadi, although there is no inscription confirming this. This was the secondary capital of the Magadi rulers such as Kempegowda. From 1638 to 1728, Mysore took over this place and Dalavayi Devaraja occupied this place with the palace at Nelapattana. In 1791 Lord Cornwallis captured it from Tipu Sultan's forces during the Third Anglo- Mysore War.Wilks, Mark.

There is a Temple of Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy, where there is an Idol of Lord Narasimha has been worshiped for many generations. Climbing Savandurga provides for some top class serious slab climbing routes in the world. There are a dozen routes, bolted or otherwise on the south face of the monolith. These range anywhere from 700 to 950 feet of technical climbs, providing sport, trad or a trad-sport mix. Most popular routes include Beladingalu (5.10a sport/trad mix), Simple Monkey Day (5.10a sport), Deepavali set of routes (trad routes with multiple variations that range from 5.7+ G to 5.9 R/X in difficulty).

History On 25 December 2008, Reliance Petroleum Limited (RPL) announced the commissioning of its refinery into a Special Economic Zone in Jamnagar district of Gujarat, India. The completion of the RPL refinery has enabled Jamnagar to emerge as a ‚ÄòRefinery land‚Äô, housing the world's largest refining complex with an aggregate refining capacity of of oil per day, more than any other single location in the world. The globally competitive RPL refinery was commissioned in 36 months. RPL contracted several companies having expertise in engineering construction and refining like Bechtel, UOP LLC and Foster Wheeler amongst others. There were plans for the pipeline to process High Pour Point crude oil extracted at Barmer, Rajasthan, although this would require an electrically heated traced pipeline to be set up from Barmer to Jamnagar. The entire complex, as of 2013, consists of manufacturing and allied facilities, utilities, off-sites, port facilities and a township (415 acres) with housing for its 2,500 employees, on over of land. If all of the pipes used in the refinery were laid out, one after another, they would connect the whole of India from north to south. Export expansion during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic the domestic demand for polymer strongly declined in India. As a result, in order to keep production and sales running, Reliance Industries Limited management decided to refocus the production of polymer on export markets. With the help of the Maersk shipping and logistics group, exports from the Jamnagar Refinery were quadrupled to over 10,000 x 40' containers, which transported and exported through Port Pipavav.https://www.maersk.com/news/articles/2020/07/08/keeping-supply-chains- moving-during-covid-19 See also *List of oil refineries *Petrochemicals *Chemical engineering References External links * Category:Oil refineries in India Category:Reliance Industries Category:Jamnagar district Category:2008 establishments in India Category:Economy of Gujarat Category:Jamnagar Category:Energy in Gujarat ","title":"Jamnagar Refinery"},{"id":"4248669","text":"Insyde Software () () is a company that specializes in UEFI system firmware and engineering support services, primarily for OEM and ODM computer and component device manufacturers.

It is owned and operated by the Rosneft. History Construction of the refinery started in 1996. The refinery project was delayed several times due to environmental concerns and financial problems, including initial cost over runs and a shortfall in equity contributions. In 1998, it was 60% complete but was struck by a cyclone that caused considerable damage. Construction was restarted in 2005 and the refinery was completed in 2006. It costs US$2.14 billion. Description Essar Oil reported commercial production of 10.5mtpa in May 2008. The units commissioned in the first phase were the CDU, VDU, sulphur gas unit, naphtha hydrotreater, catalytic cracker and visbreaker. The fluid catalytic cracker and a diesel hydro desulphuriser were commissioned in November 2006. The FCC and DHDS plants were modified so as to be compliant with the cleaner Euro III and Euro IV fuels. The refinery configuration lends itself well to de-bottlenecking and its capacity is enhanced to 14mtpa in 2009. The docking facilities include an SBM capable of handling vessels up to 350,000DWT with a capacity of 25mtpa, tankages with interconnecting pipelines of 20mtpa capacity, marine product dispatch capacity of 12mtpa and rail-car and truck-loading facilities.  2012 expansion  The refinery is expanded to a capacity of 20 million tonnes per annum. Essar Oil Ltd (EOL) announced the completion of the Rs 8,300-crore expansion of its Vadinar Refinery with the successful commissioning of the final Delayed Coker unit (DCU), which is amongst the world's largest. The Vadinar Refinery is now India's second largest single-location refinery, with an annual capacity of 20 million tonnes (405,000 barrels per day) and a complexity of 11.8, which also makes it among the world's most complex refineries. The capacity expansion and complexity enhancement gives the Vadinar Refinery the capability to process much heavier crude diet. The share of ultra heavy crude, which currently constitute 20% of crude basket, will go up to 60%; and as a result the overall share of heavy and ultra heavy crude will go up to 80% of the refinery's total crude basket. The company has already entered into long-term crude sourcing contract with global suppliers, including several national oil companies from Latin America. In terms of product yield, the Vadinar Refinery now has the flexibility to produce higher value, high-quality products, including gasoline (petrol) and gas oil (diesel) conforming to Euro IV and Euro V norms, that have growing acceptance in both domestic and international markets. Close to 80% of its production will now be of valuable light and middle distillates; and 50% of the production of gas oil (diesel) and gasoline (petrol) will meet Euro IV and Euro V specifications. EOL is targeting newer markets such as Australia, New Zealand and north-west Europe, in addition to countries in the Indian subcontinent for exporting high-quality fuels. However Essar Oil will continue to market a majority of its products in the domestic market. The Vadinar Refinery benefits from a fully integrated infrastructure including India's only captive coal-fired power plant to provide power and process steam, a port, pipelines and tankage, with multi-modal product dispatch facilities through rail, road, and sea, giving it a unique cost advantage.

Landmark's population at the 2016 census was 1,292. Landmark serves largely as a dormitory community or exurb for people who work in Winnipeg but prefer to reside in a smaller community. The Landmark businesses have, through the years, highlighted that the community lies on the longitudinal centre of Canada. Landmark lies in an area with rich black soil known to yield fine crops. Situated in a low-lying area, the community relies on drainage provided by the constructed Seine River Diversion to minimize flooding caused by the spring melt.  History  Although at least four homesteads were established in about 1907, much of the area was barren until just after World War I. It was at this time that a number of Mennonite families living in the neighbouring East Reserve faced shortages of land for agricultural expansion. By 1920, a dozen Mennonite families had purchased land in the area and had begun establishing their new farms. Within a year of that, the area had its first church building, and by 1925 a school district had been organized.Loewen, Royden (1970). Blumenort: A Mennonite Community in Transition. page 471. The main transportation link in the Landmark area in the early years was the Old Dawson Trail, a crude road that led westward to Winnipeg and eastward to Ste. Anne. In about 1920, the east part of the area of Prairie Rose was registered as the name \\"Landmark\\", being picked at random from a list of names in the \\"Farmer's Advocate\\" by early resident Peter M. Penner and his eldest son.100 Years In Our Community: A Centennial Project of the Landmark 4-H Home Ec. Club (1970), page 71. Numerous businesses sprung up in Landmark in the 1950s. One of the first businesses in the Landmark area, a repair shop named Landmark Motors, opened in 1950, followed the next year by the Landmark General Store. Landmark‚Äôs largest business, a livestock and poultry feed supplier called Landmark Feeds Inc, was established in 1954. In 1957, a plumbing and heating business opened, followed a year later by a second repair shop, Lincoln Sales & Service (now Giesbrecht Mechanical).100 Years In Our Community: A Centennial Project of the Landmark 4-H Home Ec. Club (1970), page 81.Reflections on our heritage (1971) Derksen Printers Ltd., p.345-46. In 1961, Landmark Collegiate Institute opened in Landmark, largely due to the efforts of local farmer and businessman John J Hildebrand. He worked tirelessly to promote Landmark as the location of the new school, rather than on the prairie between several population centres. Persons of Mennonite descent continue to form the largest identifiable group in Landmark, although immigration to the area has altered the demographic in recent years.  Economy  While Landmark is predominantly a farming community, with many dairy, hog, poultry, and grain farming operations, it offers a number of services. These include a gift shop and ceramic painting studio, livestock and poultry feed supplier, a swine management company with a truck and trailer wash, a credit union, a post office, insurance company, fire hall, youth centre, an arena, a new Kinsmen rec centre, and baseball diamond, two repair garages, one restaurant, a convenience store and gas station, as well as two schools (K‚Äì6) and (7‚Äì12), and four churches.

Reign In China, the Sui dynasty was followed by the Tang dynasty in 618, the year of Yeongnyu's ascension. Goguryeo was recovering from the Goguryeo‚ÄìSui War, and the new Tang emperor was still completing its internal unification. Neither being in a position for new hostilities, Goguryeo and Tang exchanged emissaries and upon Tang's request, conducted a prisoner exchange in 622. In 624, Tang officially presented Taoism to the Goguryeo court, which sent scholars the following year to study Taoism and Buddhism. However, as Tang gained strength, in 631, it sent a small force to destroy a monument to Goguryeo's victory over the Sui. In response, Goguryeo built the Cheolli Jangseong defensive wall along the western border, a 15-year project begun in 631 under the supervision of Yeon Gaesomun. During this time, Goguryeo continued its battles to recover lost territory from the southern Korean kingdom Silla. Silla's Kim Yu-sin took Goguryeo's Nangbi fortress in 629.

Life Armas J√§rnefelt was born in Vyborg, in the Grand Duchy of Finland, the son of General August Aleksander J√§rnefelt and Elisabeth J√§rnefelt (n√©e Clodt von J√ºrgensburg). J√§rnefelt studied with Ferruccio Busoni in Helsinki and with Jules Massenet in Paris. Both J√§rnefelt and Busoni enjoyed a close relationship with Jean Sibelius, who was married to J√§rnefelt's sister Aino. From 1905 J√§rnefelt had a long career as conductor at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm, beginning as repetiteur from 1905-1911 (he became a Swedish citizen in 1909); conductor 1911-1923 and chief conductor 1923‚Äì1933.Photo of J√§rnefelt conducting the Royal Swedish Orchestra during the 400th anniversary celebrations of the Royal Swedish Opera (in Swedish).

He conducted the premiere performances of a number of works, among them Nikolai Myaskovsky's Sixth Symphony in May 1924. Golovanov held some of the highest musical positions in the USSR, including an extensive association with the Bolshoi Opera. In her autobiography, Galina Vishnevskaya terms him the theater's chief conductor, and tells of his dismissal from the Bolshoi and his death - which she attributed to the humiliation of the experience of losing this position. It has been reported that Golovanov's firing was the result of Stalin's displeasure at Golovanov's having tried to use a Jewish singer, Mark Reizen, in the title role of Tsar Boris Godunov in his recording of Mussorgsky's opera. Golovanov actually did record the opera with Reizen as Boris, but later remade Reizen's part with another Boris, Alexander Pirogov. Golovanov's recorded output was substantial and quite individual in interpretive approach. In his discography we find all but one of the Liszt tone poems, the complete Scriabin symphonies and Piano Concerto, Tchaikovsky's First and Sixth symphonies, as well as shorter works, Beethoven's First Symphony, Violin Concerto and Triple Concerto, Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade and his operas Sadko and Christmas Eve, Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov and Pictures at an Exhibition, Rachmaninoff's Second and Third symphonies, the opera Aleko and other compositions, Glazunov's Fifth, Sixth and Seventh symphonies, and scores by Grieg, Mozart and others. Based upon the evidence of his recordings, Golovanov's characteristic performance mode was full-blooded and nearly vehement in tone, with a powerful, almost overloaded sense of sonority, and extreme flexibility in matters of tempo, phrasing and dynamics. In addition to audio recordings by Golovanov, there is extant visual representation of his conducting style. Possibly during the Second World War, evidently intended as a morale booster, there was produced a film of Golovanov conducting a group called the USSR State Symphony Orchestra in a performance of the Tchaikovsky \\"1812 Overture.\\" As was the practice in the USSR, the Tsarist anthem was replaced in the score with the chorus \\"Glory, Glory to you, holy Russia!\\" from Glinka's \\"A Life for the Tsar.\\" The film does not feature synchronous sound, and concerns itself primarily with various Soviet functionaries, Military figures and Orthodox Priests (!) in the audience; However, the short segments of Golovanov conducting show an energetic but physically spare conducting style, one seemingly at odds with the sometimes extreme nature of his interpretations. Golovanov was also a composer; his works include the opera \\"Princess Yurata\\", a symphony and other orchestral works as well as choral music.

His work is noted for its exaggerated cartoon style and Yiddish- inflected English dialogue. He originated the non-sequitur \\"Banana Oil!\\" as a phrase deflating pomposity and posing. His character Count Screwloose's admonition, \\"Iggy, keep an eye on me!\\", became a national catchphrase. The National Cartoonists Society fund to aid indigent cartoonists and their families for many years was known as the Milt Gross Fund. In 2005, it was absorbed by the Society's Foundation, which continues the charitable work of the Fund. Comic strips and books Gross was born in the the Bronx and served as a soldier in World War I. After apprenticing as a teenage assistant to Tad Dorgan, Gross's first comic strip was Phool Phan Phables for the New York Journal, begun when he was 20, featuring a rabid sports fan named George Phan. It was one of several short-lived comic strips (and other undertakings, including his first animated film) before his first success, Gross Exaggerations, which began as an illustrated column, \\"Gross Exaggerations in the Dumbwaiter\\", in the New York World. Originally titled Banana Oil until 1925, the comic strip was retitled Gross Exaggerations until becoming The Feitelbaum Family on June 1, 1926, and finally Looy Dot Dope on January 7, 1927. Its Yinglish vocabulary would set the tone for much of Gross' work, as would its reworkings of well-known tales, as in \\"Nize Ferry-tail from Elledin witt de Wanderful Lemp\\" and \\"Jack witt de Binn Stuck\\". These were gathered in a 1926 book Nize Baby, which evolved into a Sunday newspaper color comic strip. Also in 1926, he published Hiawatta witt No Odder Poems, a 40-page parody of Longfellow's The Song of Hiawatha, each of its pages, in the words of Jim Vadeboncoeur, Jr., \\"with a barely decipherable stanza and a drawing which only sometimes helped\\". In subsequent years, Gross followed with De Night in de Front from Chreesmas, Dunt Esk (1927) and Famous Fimmales witt Odder Ewents from Heestory (1928). In 1930, Gross published what many consider his masterpiece, the pantomime tale He Done Her Wrong: The Great American Novel and Not a Word in It ‚Äî No Music, Too. Minus words, this \\"novel\\" is composed entirely of pen-and-ink cartoons, nearly 300 pages long, and is comparable to such silent films serials as The Perils of Pauline. It resembled (and parodied) Lynd Ward's Gods' Man, the first American wordless novel, published the previous year.. It has been reprinted several times, including an abridged version in 1983 (retitled Hearts of Gold) and in 2005 by Fantagraphics, under its original title. Starting in 1931, Gross worked for the Hearst chain, doing various syndicated comic strips and Sunday topper strips, including Dave's Delicatessen, Banana Oil, Pete the Pooch, Count Screwloose from Tooloose, Babbling Brooks, Otto and Blotto, The Meanest Man, Draw Your Own Conclusion, I Did It and I'm Glad! and That's My Pop! (which later became a radio show). While his strips' vocabulary moved closer to standard English over time, his work always maintained Yiddish touches. In 1936, he illustrated two books in collaboration, Pasha the Persian (by Margaret Linden) and What's This? (with Robert M. Low and Lou Wedemar). In 1945, the year of his book Dear Dollink, he suffered a heart attack and went into semi-retirement. His last book was I Shouda Ate the Eclair (published 1946), in which one Mr. Figgits nearly starts World War III because he refuses to eat a chocolate √©clair. In 1946‚Äì47, his work appeared in the short-lived comic book Picture News. His final published work appeared in the pages of comic books published by American Comics Group, including two issues of Milt Gross Funnies. In 1950, two of his earlier books were combined as Hiawatta and De Night in De Front From Chreesmas. Animation Gross made occasional animated films through the silent film era, including The Ups & Downs of Mr. Phool Phan (his first), Useless Hints by Fuller Prunes, Izzy Able the Detective and How My Vacation Spent Me. Most of these were for Bray Productions, the studio of John R. Bray. Other were for Universal. In 1939, he returned to animation with two MGM cartoons, Jitterbug Follies and Wanted: No Master, featuring Count Screwloose (voiced by Mel Blanc). According to Bill Littlejohn they were both extremely funny works. But Fred Quimby thought them to be too vulgar and had Gross fired.Cohen (2004), p. 40 Death On November 29, 1953, Gross died of a heart attack aboard the Pacific Ocean liner SS Monterey, while returning from a Hawaiian vacation with his wife. He was buried at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California. At the time of his death he was developing a children's TV show starring his character Pete the Pooch, which combined animation with live-action footage of Gross as host. Two pilot episodes were completed but never shown to the public. Legacy In 2009 the New York University Press published Is Diss a System?: A Milt Gross Comic Reader,\\"Here's to You, Mrs. Feitlebaum\\" by J.W. Joselit New Republic 17 Feb. 2010 which argues for Gross' importance as a link between the cartooning cultures of the first and second halves of the 20th century, especially as they related to Jewish culture.Paul Buhle, \\"Grossed Out, Or Remembered At Last? A Genius of Comic Confusion\\", The Forward, April 9, 2010. In August 1971, Dover Publications reprinted Nize Baby. In 2010, cartoon historian Craig Yoe edited The Complete Milt Gross Comic Books and Life Story, a complete collection of the Gross comic book stories from the 1940s with a lengthy illustrated biography by Yoe and an Al Jaffee introduction.

He was appointed Governor of West Pakistan in September 1957 succeeding Mushtaq Ahmed Gurmani and then continued in this office during the regime of General Muhammad Ayub Khan until April 1960. Early life Akhter Husain was born on 1 August 1902 at Burhanpur (Central Province India) and received his early education from Hakimia High School, Burhanpur before proceeding to MAO College at Aligarh (which later became Aligarh Muslim University), graduating later from Allahbad University. He was selected for the prestigious Indian Civil Service in 1924 and completed his education and training at St. John's College, Cambridge, England. Upon return from England, he was posted to serve in the province of Punjab in 1926. He served in various administrative positions in different districts of the province, before being appointed as Under Secretary in the Government of India in 1930. He returned to Provincial administration in 1936. Akhter Husain received a British government award of Order of the British Empire (OBE) on 1 January 1944 for his groundbreaking work of settlement in the district of Gurgaon in Punjab in 1943. He was appointed Chief Secretary in the undivided Punjab in 1946, a position he occupied during the partition of British India. Pakistan Government Service He continued to serve as the Chief Secretary of West Punjab in the newly formed Dominion of Pakistan in 1947. The years immediately following the creation of Pakistan were fraught with many problems not the least of which was the settlement of the influx of refugees from across the border from India. Mr. Akhter Husain was appointed as the Financial Commissioner in charge of the resettlement of refugees and the revenue and administrative issues involved therein. This massive project notwithstanding, he was appointed to various commissions and inquiry committees during this period, some of which require special mention here. He was appointed chairman of the committee for the implementation of Lord Boyd Orr's recommendations on agricultural reforms, member of the Tenancy Law Inquiry Committee, and as consultant of the reorganization of Karachi administration. In 1954, he was transferred to Karachi and took over charge as Secretary, Ministry of Defence in the Government of Pakistan. In the same year, he was appointed as chairman of the One-Unit secretariat committee, and the following year as the Chairman of the Karachi Administration Committee. He travelled to the United States with the prime minister's delegation in 1957 and visited some defence facilities. On his way back to Pakistan, he received the news that by common consent of all political parties and the government, he had been appointed as the Governor of West Pakistan. Governor Akhter Husain was appointed Governor on 28 August 1957 and remained in this position following the imposition of Martial law in Oct 1958. In the same year he was appointed Chairman of the Land Reforms Commission and provincial administration committee. In 1958, he was awarded the highest civil award of Hilal-i-Pakistan. He also laid the Pakistan Day Memorial's foundation stone (now known as Minar-e-Pakistan) in the then Minto Park in Lahore on 23 March 1960. Later years In 1960 after his governorship, he was appointed as minister in the Presidential cabinet successively holding the portfolios of Information and Broadcasting and then Education and Kashmir Affairs. In order to hold these quasi-political positions, he retired from the Civil Service. He was also the recipient of the honorary degree of Doctor of Law from the University of the Punjab. He was subsequently appointed Chief Election Commissioner of Pakistan and served in that position between 1962-1964.

He is considered as one of the two notable disciples of Matsyendranath. His followers are found in India at the place known as Garbhagiri which is in Ahmednagar in the state of Maharashtra. These followers are called yogis, Gorakhnathi, Darshani or Kanphata. He was one of nine saints also known as Navnath and is widely popular in Maharashtra, India. Hagiographies describe him as more than a human teacher and someone outside the laws of time who appeared on earth in different ages. Historians state Gorakhnath lived sometime during the first half of the 2nd millennium CE, but they disagree in which century. Estimates based on archaeology and text range from Briggs' 15th- to 12th-century to Grierson's estimate of the 14th-century. Gorakhnath is considered a Maha-yogi (or great yogi) in the Hindu tradition. He did not emphasise a specific metaphysical theory or a particular Truth, but emphasised that the search for Truth and the spiritual life is a valuable and normal goal of man. Gorakhnath championed Yoga, spiritual discipline and an ethical life of self- determination as a means to reaching samadhi and one's own spiritual truths. Gorakhnath, his ideas and yogis have been highly popular in rural India, with monasteries and temples dedicated to him found in many states of India, particularly in the eponymous city of Gorakhpur.David N. Lorenzen and Adri√°n Mu√±oz (2012), Yogi Heroes and Poets: Histories and Legends of the Naths, SUNY Press, , pp. x‚Äìxi Biography Historian accounts Historians vary in their estimate on when Gorakhnath lived. Estimates based on archaeology and text range from Briggs' 11th- to 12th-century to Baba Farid documents and Jnanesvari manuscripts leading Abbott to connect Gorakhnath to the 13th- century, to Grierson who relying on evidence discovered in Gujarat suggests the 14th-century. His influence is found in the numerous references to him in the poetry of Kabir and of Guru Nanak of Sikhism, which describe him as a very powerful leader with a large following, thereby suggesting he likely lived around the time these spiritual leaders lived in India. Historical texts imply that Gorakhnath was originally a Buddhist in a region influenced by Shaivism, and he converted to Hinduism championing Shiva and Yoga. Gorakhnath led a life as a passionate exponent of ideas of Kumarila and Adi Shankara that championed the Yoga and Advaita Vedanta interpretation of the Upanishads. Gorakhnath considered the controversy between dualism and nondualism spiritual theories in medieval India as useless from practice point of view, he emphasised that the choice is of the yogi, that the spiritual discipline and practice by either path leads to \\"perfectly illumined samadhi state of the individual phenomenal consciousness\\", states Banerjea. Hagiographic accounts The hagiography on Gorakhnath describe him to have appeared on earth several times. The legends do not provide a time or place where he was born, and consider him to be superhuman. North Indian hagiographies suggest he originated from northwest India (Punjab, with some mentioning Peshawar). Other hagiographies on Gorakhnath in (Bengal) and Bihar suggest he originated from eastern region of India (including Bangladesh). These hagiographies are inconsistent, and offer varying records of the spiritual descent of Gorakhnath. All name Adinath and Matsyendranath as two teachers preceding him in the succession. Though one account lists five gurus preceding Adinath and another lists six teachers between Matsyendranath and Gorakhnath, current tradition has Adinath identified with Lord Shiva as the direct teacher of Matsyendranath, who was himself the direct teacher of Gorakhnath. The legends in the Nath tradition assert that he travelled widely across the Indian subcontinent, and accounts about him are found in some form in several places including Nepal, Punjab, Sindh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Assam, Tripura, Bengal, Odisha, Kathiawar(Gujarat), Maharashtra, Karnataka, and even Sri Lanka. Nath Sampradaya The Nath tradition states that its traditions existed before Gorakhnath, but the movement's greatest expansion happened under the guidance and inspiration of Gorakhnath. He produced a number of writings and even today is considered the greatest of the Naths. It has been purported that Gorakhnath wrote the first books on Laya yoga. In India there are many caves, many with temples built over them, where it is said that Gorakhnath spent time in meditation. According to Bhagawan Nityananda, the samadhi shrine (tomb) of Gorakhnath is at Nath Mandir near the Vajreshwari temple about one kilometre from Ganeshpuri, Maharashtra, India. According to legends Gorakhnath and Matsyendranath did penance in Kadri Temple at Mangalore, Karnataka. They are also instrumental in laying Shivlingam at Kadri and Dharmasthala. The temple of Gorakhnath is also situated on hill called Garbhagiri near Vambori, Tal Rahuri; Dist Ahmednagar. There is also a famous temple of Gorakhnath in the state of Odisha. Gorakhnath Math Gorakhnath mandir in Gorakhpur, India The Gorakhnath Math is a monastery of the Nath monastic group named after the medieval saint, Gorakhnath (c. 11th century), of the Nath sampradaya. The math and town of Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh is named after him. The monastery and the temple perform various cultural and social activities and serve as the cultural hub of the city. The monastery also publishes texts on the philosophy of Gorakhnath. Influence Hatha yoga Some scholars associate the origins of Hatha yoga with the Nath yogis, in particular Gorakhnath and his guru Matsyendranath.James Mallinson (2014). The Yogƒ´s‚Äô Latest Trick. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (Third Series), 24, pp. 165‚Äì180. , Quote: \\"That these NƒÅth Yogƒ´s were the originators and foremost exponents of ha·π≠hayoga is a given of all historical studies of yoga. But these Yogƒ´s were in fact the willing and complicit beneficiaries of the semantic confusion which has caught out White and many other scholars.\\" According to British indologist James Mallinson, this association is false. In his view, the origins of hatha yoga should be associated with the Dashanami Sampradaya of Advaita Vedanta (Hinduism), the mystical figure of Dattatreya, and the RƒÅmƒÅnandƒ´s. While the origins of Hatha yoga are disputed, according to Guy Beck, a professor of Religious Studies known for his studies on Yoga and music, \\"the connections between Goraknath, the Kanphatas and Hatha yoga are beyond question\\". Nepal The Gurkhas of Nepal and Indian Gorkhas take their name from this saint. He has long been considered the rastradevata (lord of state) of Nepal, with his name appearing on numerous versions of Nepalese coins and currency notes. Gorkha, a historical district of Nepal, is named after him. There is a cave with his paduka (footprints) and an idol of him. Every year on the day of Baisakh Purnima there is a great celebration in Gorkha at his cave, called Rot Mahotsav; it has been celebrated for the last seven hundred years. A legend asserts, state William Northey and John Morris, that a disciple of Machendra by name Gorakhnath, once visited Nepal and retired to a little hill near Deo Patan . There he meditated in an unmovable state for twelve years. The locals built a temple in his honour there, and it has since been remembered with. In Tamil Siddhar tradition Korakkar is one among the 18 Siddhars and also known as Goraknath amongst Navanathar. Agattiyar and Bogar were his gurus. His Jeeva samadhi temple is in Vadukupoigainallur of Nagapattinam district of Tamil Nadu. According to one account, he spent a portion of his growing-up years in the Velliangiri Mountains in Coimbatore. Other sanctums related with Korakkar are Perur, Thiruchendur and Triconamalli. Korakkar caves are found in Chaturagiri and Kolli Hills. Like other siddhas, Korakkar has written songs on Medicine, Philosophy, and Alchemy. West Bengal ‚Äì Assam ‚Äì Tripura The Bengali Community located in these states and neighbouring country of Bangladesh have a sizeable number of Yogi Brahmins (also called Rudraja Brahmins/ Yogi Nath‚Äîwho used surnames like Debnath, Debsharma, Nath and Bhowmick) who have taken their name from this saint. Community kitchens According to Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair, a professor of Sikh Studies, Gorakhnath orders in Punjab were operating free community kitchens in Punjab when Guru Nanak founded Sikhism. Gorakhnath shrines have continued to operate a langar and provide a free meal to pilgrims who visit. Works Romola Butalia, an Indian writer of Yoga history, lists the works attributed to Gorakhnath as follows: \\"Guru Gorakhnath is thought to have authored several books including the Goraksha Samhita, Goraksha Gita, Siddha Siddhanta Paddhati, Yoga Martanada, Yoga Siddhanta Paddhati, Yoga-Bija, Yoga Chintamani. He is believed to be the founder of the Nath Sampradaya and it is stated that the nine Naths and 84 Siddhas are all human forms created as yogic manifestations to spread the message of yoga and meditation to the world. It is they who reveal samadhi to mankind.\\" Siddha Siddhanta Paddhati The Siddha Siddhanta Paddhati is a Hatha Yoga Sanskrit text attributed to Gorakhnath by the Nath tradition. According to Feuerstein (1991: p. 105), it is \\"one of the earliest hatha yoga scriptures, the Siddha Siddhanta Paddhati, contains many verses that describe the avadhuta\\" (liberated) yogi.Feuerstein, Georg (1991). 'Holy Madness'. In Yoga Journal May/June 1991. With calligraphy by Robin Spaan. Source: p. 105 (accessed: 29 February 2011) The Siddha Siddhanta Paddhati text is based on an advaita (nonduality) framework, where the yogi sees \\"himself in all beings, and all in himself\\" including the identity of the individual soul (Atman) with the universal (Brahman). This idea appears in the text in various forms, such as the following: See also *Gorakh Hill *Gurkha *Gorkha Kingdom *Gorakhnath Temple *Korakkar *Ratan Nath Temple *Tilla Jogian *Yogi Nath *List of Hindu gurus and saints References Sources * * (2009 Reprint)   Further reading  *Adityanath (2005).

Gui was born in Rome in 1885. He graduated in humanities at the University of Rome and also studied composition at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia; his principal composition teachers were the noted composers Giacomo Setaccioli and Stanislao Falchi. His style was \\"impressionistic with characteristic Italian traits\\".The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians Gui's opera David premiered in Rome in 1907; later that year, he made his professional conducting debut at the Teatro Adriano in Rome, leading Ponchielli's La Gioconda as a substitute. This led to invitations to conduct in Naples and Turin (he met Claude Debussy in Turin in 1911). In 1923, Arturo Toscanini invited him to conduct Salome by Richard Strauss as the season opener at La Scala in Milan. He conducted the Teatro Regio in Turin from 1925 to 1927; in his last year in Turin, he premiered his fairy-tale opera Fata Malerba there. (Other notable compositions included the cantata Cantico dei cantici (\\"Song of Songs\\") from 1921, and the symphonic poem Giulietta e Romeo (with voices, from 1902).) In 1928, Gui founded and conducted the Orchestra Stabile; he developed the organization of the orchestra into the 1933 Maggio Musicale Fiorentino or \\"Florence May Music Festival\\", which he led until 1943. At the festival he conducted unusual operas such as Verdi's Luisa Miller, Spontini's La vestale, Cherubini's M√©d√©e and Gluck's Armide. In 1933 Bruno Walter invited Gui to be guest conductor at the Salzburg Festival, and in 1936 Sir Thomas Beecham invited him to be a regular conductor at the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden. He spent World War II in Britain.https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/18/archives/vittorio-gui- dies-conductor-was-90-italian-also-composed-and-wrote.html In 1948, he made his debut with the Glyndebourne Festival company, leading Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte in the Carl Ebert production at the Edinburgh Festival. He served as the Glyndebourne Festival's Musical Director from 1951 to 1963, and as its \\"artistic counselor\\" from 1963 to 1965, when he made his last appearances there. Gui was particularly known for his conducting of the works of Brahms, of which he was said to be a leading conductor in Italy. In 1947, the 50th anniversary of Brahms's death, Gui conducted a complete cycle of Brahms's orchestral and choral works in that country. He was also known for conducting contemporary music and first performances; among works he premiered was Dallapiccola's first major composition, his Partita, in 1933. Vittorio Gui was also a prolific author and critic. Notable writings include his 1924 study of Boito's opera Nerone, an article on \\"Mozart in Italy\\" from 1955, and his collected essays, Battute d'aspetto (1946). Gui died in Florence in 1975, aged 90. Recordings Numerous recordings survive of Gui's work either from the studio or as airchecks, including the last two Brahms symphonies and some Mozart symphonies, and numerous operatic performances. Among others, his 1949 recording of Verdi's opera A Masked Ball has been reissued on CD, as has his 1950 performance of Wagner's Parsifal with Maria Callas. His 1952 performance of Bellini's Norma with Callas on EMI is particularly prized, as is his pioneering 1937 complete recording of the opera with Gina Cigna in the title role and Ebe Stignani as Adalgisa, made in Turin. His 1962 Abbey Road Studio-1 stereo recording by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra of Rossini's The Barber of Seville has been released on the Great Recordings of the Century by EMI. There is also a recording of The Marriage of Figaro from Glyndebourne on EMI, with Sena Jurinac as the Contessa. In 1954 he conducted Spontini's Agnes von Hohenstaufen at the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino with Franco Corelli, Lucilla Udovich and Giangiacomo Guelfi.ArkivMusic External links *Biography * References Category:1885 births Category:1975 deaths Category:Musicians from Rome Category:Italian composers Category:Italian male composers Category:Italian male conductors (music) Category:Music directors (opera) Category:Glyndebourne Festival Opera Category:Italian musicologists Category:Sapienza University of Rome alumni Category:Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia alumni Category:20th-century musicologists Category:20th-century Italian conductors (music) Category:20th-century Italian male musicians ","title":"Vittorio Gui"},{"id":"4248848","text":"The arms of office of the Chief Herald of Canada Chief Herald of Canada is the title held by the head of the Canadian Heraldic Authority.

Pawn movement Pawns move one square diagonally forward: White from right to left; Black left to right. They capture orthogonally in direction of movements (see diagram). The white pawn on f3 can move to e4 and capture on e3 and f4. The black pawn on b6 can move to c5 and capture on b5 and c6.

Early life The family and its name stemmed from the Silesian village of Weizenrodau, now Pszenno. Watzenrode was born in Thorn (Toru≈Ñ), son of the merchant Lucas Watzenrode the Elder (1400‚Äì62). He studied at Jagiellonian University and at Cologne and Bologna. After his sister Barbara and her husband Niklas KoppernigkNicolaus Copernicus Gesamtausgabe , Regesta Copernicana died in about 1483, Lucas cared for their four children, Katharina, Barbara, Andreas and Nicolaus, the last of whom would become known as astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus. Historic background The Bishopric of Warmia, previously part of the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights, had, with the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), come under the protection of the King of Poland. Based on that treaty, the Polish King had the right to appoint the Bishop. Neither the Warmia chapter, however, nor their newly elected bishop, Nicolaus von T√ºngen (1467‚Äì89), acknowledged the King's right to do so. Poland contested von T√ºngen's election, and this led to the War of the Priests (1467‚Äì79) and the First Treaty of Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski (1479), by which the chapter was obliged to seek consensus with the Polish king. The Bishopric of Warmia was made suffragan to the Archbishopric of Riga, then headed by Archbishop Michael Hildebrand. Bishop This agreement was somewhat vague, as shown in the 1489 election of the next bishop, Lucas Watzenrode, who was mitred by Pope Innocent VIII against the explicit wishes of King Casimir IV Jagiellon, who would have preferred that one of his sons, Frederic, become Bishop of Warmia. Watzenrode resisted, and when Casimir died in 1492 and was succeeded by John I Albert, Watzenrode could finally establish the exemption of the Bishopric from Riga. With the Second Treaty of Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski (1512), later bishops accepted a limited influence of the Polish King on elections. The Holy See considered the Bishopric exempt until 1992, when it was made an archbishopric, which by its nature is exempt. Watzenrode, a successful organizer of his territory's internal affairs, resided at Heilsber, now Lidzbark. He reorganized the cathedral school and planned to found a university at Elbing, now ElblƒÖg. He argued that the Teutonic Order had fulfilled its mission in the Baltic region, by then converted to Christianity, and proposed sending the Order to more heathen regions. The Ottoman Empire was an ongoing threat and had taken over large parts of Europe, and the Bishop suggested that the Order \\"do battle with the Turks.\\" The Bishopric was exposed to repeated armed attacks by the Teutonic Order, which attempted to regain the territory. Poland sought to rescind the Prince-Bishopric's autonomy, hoping to force the surrender of its prerogatives to the Polish crown. In this area of conflict, Watzenrode guarded the interests of Warmia and maintained friendly relations with Poland. He was a long-time opponent of the Teutonic Knights, and shortly after his death it was rumored that he had been poisoned by them.Alan W. Hirshfeld, \\"Parallax: The Race to Measure the Cosmos\\", Macmillan, 2002, pg. 38, Family Watzenrode looked after his orphaned two nephews and two nieces. Katharina married businessman and city councilor Barthel Gertner, while Barbara became a Benedictine nun. Watzenrode sent the brothers Nicolaus (Copernicus) and Andreas to study at the Krak√≥w Academy and in Italy (Bologna, Padua, Ferrara). After his studies, Copernicus assisted his uncle in administrative matters and was his closest advisor as well as his personal physician. Watzenrode also took care of his son Philipp Teschner, whose mother was the daughter of the rector of the Johannes school in Thorn. When Watzenrode became bishop he arranged for Philipp Teschner to become mayor of Braunsberg. Lucas Watzenrode the Younger died in Thorn (Toru≈Ñ) during his return from an official journey.

But having both powers was making people conceited and lazy. So God split the world in to the world of science, Erde (German for Earth), and the world of magic, Phandavale. One day in Phandavale, a terrible witch named Cendrillon revives. Cendrillon plots to rule both worlds, and searches for the \\"key of Erde\\" and the \\"key of Phandavale\\" which holds tremendous power. A young boy from Erde by the name of S≈çta meets a mysterious girl from Phandavale, Akazukin (Red Riding Hood), and her talking wolf companion, Val. S≈çta learns that he is the key of Erde. Now it is up to Akazukin, Val, and the other Musketeers, Shirayukihime (Snow White) and Ibara (Sleeping Beauty) to protect S≈çta from Cendrillon and her Nightmarians who wish to obtain the power he mysteriously possesses. Characters ; :The titular heroine from the magic world Phandavale (Magic). She is one of the Three Musketeers, and has come to the Erde world to protect Souta who holds the Erde Key. She uses magic, but her speciality seems to be physical attacks. She can control fire magic. Later on she gets an upgrade in her powers when the Three Musketeers try to obtain the ultimate magic. She was the one that received it, and when she activated it she called it Princess Mode, due to the fact it makes her look like a princess like the other two Musketeers. The power is like the other card magic she usually uses. The only thing is, it does not stay active all the time, only when used. She was born in Vise village, the same village where she met Val for the first time: the morning after the village was destroyed. Eleven years before the story, the village was destroyed by werewolves led by Jed. Jed attacked the village to kill his younger brother Cain, who is really Val. During the destruction, she lost her parents and Cain's mother. She has some feelings for Souta. Age: 14. Voiced by: Yukari Tamura ; :The protagonist from the real world Erde (Science). He has a tendency to talk to flowers in the morning on his way to school, and after talking to them they mysteriously become more charming. He cares about the flowers a lot, and they help him out in return. Souta seems to have some power of his own: this was first discovered in an attempt to save Ringo from falling by Hansel's push (he unknowingly used an unknown flash and destroyed every opposing monster in the building). After he used it, he did not realize that he contained that power and thought it was Shiryuki's. He also reacted to a story card given to him by an elderly lady. So far he has collected 5 story cards of the Two World fairy tale stories (which tells the story of how Marlene turned into Cendrillon and the reason for her hatred). He is a kind and caring person, who can tell good people from bad. He is also smart and helps out in situations that the group befalls. His key power is activated whenever he feels strong emotion. He is the key of Erde, because his mother Soya was one of the sages who defeated Cendrillon 1000 years ago, and went to Erde afterwards to give birth to the child who would be safer in Erde then Phandavale. Age: 14. Voiced by: Motoko Kumai (OVA and TV 1-25), Y≈´ko Sanpei (TV 26+) ; :From the magic world Phandavale. She is also one of the Three Musketeers, and came to Souta to protect him. She uses intellectual magic, as she was top in her magic classes. Her specialty is magic attacks. She likes Souta and always hugs him or tries to get close to him, much to Ringo's dismay. She can control ice magic and water magic. She a princess as her name suggests; however after her father remarried to a woman controlled by Cendrillon, the kingdom was taken away. Age: 14 Voiced by: Kanako Tateno ; :Souta's childhood friend, who is very close to him. She wakes him up in the morning. She is the only one who understands Souta when he talks to flowers. She also worries about him a lot, and does not want to be away from him, like when Souta was going to go to Phandavale. She gets angry whenever Shirayuki clings on to Souta. She is a very good cook, especially with meat and potatoes. She has a crush on Souta. Age: 14. Voiced by: Rie Kugimiya ; :Akazukin's companion who fights alongside her. He, like Akazukin, loves food from Erde, and even at serious moments would worry about food first. He seems to dislike Jed-same, a Lycan (werewolf). This was noticed when Souta was going to tell him that he saw a Lycan named Jed, and Val stopped him from saying it. He is Cain, Akazukin's childhood friend and Jed's younger brother, but ever since the night he was wounded by Jed, he lost the ability to transform into human form. Age: approximately 20. Voiced by: Nobuyuki Hiyama ; :From the magic world Phandavale. She is the 3rd of the Three Musketeers. She represents Sleeping Beauty, hence the reason she is usually half asleep. She uses a thorn whip to attack. Since her specialty is the Earth element, she can heal plants. It's discovered later that she is actually the princess of the Elf race, and was born with a magic talent, unlike those who have to learn it. She is always sleepy because she does not sleep at night; if she does her magic would go out of control and hurt people. Age: 14. Voiced by: Miyuki Sawashiro ; :She is the evil witch that is trying to get Erde's key. Her real name is Marlene. In the beginning she was good, but ever since the boy she liked from Erde had to go back she started to hate the concept of two worlds. Her hatred grew when one day she found a way to get to Erde and saw through the mirror that the person she liked was now with another girl. This led her to aim for dark magic and get revenge on God. Her final transformation to Cenderillon happened when the boy she loved came back to stop her, got in the way of an attack and died. Age: unknown. Voiced by: Misa Watanabe ; :One of Cendrillon's minor servants, who is no threat to the main cast. He tries to capture Souta many times but always fails. He has three followers, and as a group they use musical magic. They are the Town Musicians of Bremen. He always carries a backpack with canned food with him. His aim is to be in Cendrillon's main army. Age: 100+. Voiced by: Akiko Kobayashi ; :He hates the weak, and even goes far as making his sister (who was hurt) feel bad. He was taught dark magic by Cendrillon, and the more he learned, the less he cared for his sister. Before he met Cendrillon, he was kind to his sister and others. It turns out he was controlled by Cendrillon and returned to normal (being the kind, loving brother) when Akazukin and co help save him. Age: 17. Voiced by: Kaori Shimizu (OVA, TV (as a child)), Daisuke Hirakawa ;/ :She is Hansel's sister and cares for him. In the beginning she transferred into Souta's school and acted like a nice girl in front of him, but it was soon found out it was a trap to try to kidnap Souta. After losing the first fight against Akazukin and Shirayuki, she has tried to capture Souta many times in order to be acknowledged by her brother. It seems that when she and her brother were lost in the Forest of Okashi, they used to be on good terms, living in a house built of candy. All she really wants is to go back to being how they used to be, instead of fighting for Cendrillon. Even though she is an enemy, Souta always treats her nicely and even protects her, because he knows that she is a good person. Age: 13. Voiced by: Sayuri Yahagi ; :He is a Leaf Knight who guarded the Phandavale Castle. He was given orders from the King to wait at the captured castle until Souta the key holder came, and tell him, \\"I believe in you\\"(meaning the King believes Souta will save the magic world). After he finished his mission, he went his own way to try to save the King on his own, for he prefers doing things alone. He specializes in musical magic. He hates pumpkins because of Akazukin, as she used to wear a pumpkin mask when she was little and scared him with it, and ever since he has been afraid of them. He seems to have feelings for Ringo. Age: 15. Voiced by: Kenji Nojima ;King Fernando :He is the King of Phandavale as well Phandavale's Key. He is a kind hearted person (as described by the Three Musketeers). In the series, he spends most of his time in Cendrillon's castle as a prisoner. Even though he is in prison, he continues to smile and stay optimistic. He also has the ability to control wind magic. Age: 17. Voiced by: Hideki Tasaka ;Trude :Servant of Cendrillon. She is actually Souta's mother manipulated by Cendrillon's dark magic. She can turn anyone who looks into her eyes into a doll, as well as turn anything to stone.

The album contains long, complicated song titles and unconventional lyrics which were written in code in the booklet. Nespithe was featured in Terrorizers Secret History of Death Metal, in their list of \\"The 40 Albums You Must Hear\\"; they commented: \\"Even trying to scream your lungs out whilst vomiting a mix of Haggis, outdated goat's cheese and kebab won't do. Tested extensively by Terrorizer's scientific team, we can now safely say that no normal human is capable of reproducing the effect-free vocal madness displayed by Antti Boman on these Finns' sole, totally unique, album.\\"Badin, Olivier. Terrorizers Secret History of Death Metal, \\"The 40 Albums You Must Hear\\", p. 95, March 2010. Demilich played what was believed to be their last show on July 22, 2006, but performed many other shows since then including appearances at Jalometalli Metal Music Festival and Maryland Death Fest. History Demilich was founded in 1990 by guitarist/vocalist Antti Boman and drummer Mikko Virnes, creating a unique avant-garde sound of technical death metal in A standard tuning, with extremely low-register vocals. Demilich recorded four demo tapes (some containing re-used material from previous demos) before creating their debut, Nespithe, in 1993. The band split up shortly after the release of the album due to complications with their record label and the album's profits. Demilich remained inactive until 2005 when they reformed and began playing live shows, as well as writing new material. This material would not be released to the public until 2014. Demilich played what was to be their last show in 2006, yet performed one-off shows in the following years. The compilation release 20th Adversary of Emptiness contains everything Demilich have ever recorded, starting from Regurgitation of Blood demo (1991) and rounding things off with three songs the band recorded during their brief comeback in 2006. The only Demilich full-length album Nespithe has been reissued several times over the years in various guises, but always using the inferior 16-bit CD masters and sometimes brickwalled beyond recognition. For this release the band dug up the original unmastered 24 bit studio tapes for Nespithe and best possible sources for the demo material, and then had Sami J√§ms√©n of Studio Perkele thoroughly master these original unmastered mixes.

In scientific visualization, a maximum intensity projection (MIP) is a method for 3D data that projects in the visualization plane the voxels with maximum intensity that fall in the way of parallel rays traced from the viewpoint to the plane of projection. This implies that two MIP renderings from opposite viewpoints are symmetrical images if they are rendered using orthographic projection. MIP is used for the detection of lung nodules in lung cancer screening programs which use computed tomography scans. MIP enhances the 3D nature of these nodules, making them stand out from pulmonary bronchi and vasculature. MIP imaging is also used routinely by physicians in interpreting Positron Emission Tomography (PET) or Magnetic Resonance Angiography studies. Additional techniques This technique is computationally fast, but the 2D results do not provide a good sense of depth of the original data. To improve the sense of 3D, animations are usually rendered of several MIP frames in which the viewpoint is slightly changed from one to the other, thus creating the illusion of rotation. This helps the viewer's perception to find the relative 3D positions of the object components. However, since the projection is orthographic the viewer cannot distinguish between left or right, front or back and even if the object is rotating clockwise or anti-clockwise. Use of depth weighting during production of rotating cines of MIP images can avoid the problem of difficulty of distinguishing right from left, and clockwise vs anti-clockwise rotation. An easy improvement to MIP is Local maximum intensity projection. In this technique we don't take the global maximum value, but the first maximum value that is above a certain threshold. Because - in general - we can terminate the ray earlier this technique is faster and also gives somehow better results as it approximates occlusion. History MIP imaging was invented for use in Nuclear Medicine by Jerold Wallis, MD, in 1988 at Washington University in St Louis, and subsequently published in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging. In the setting of Nuclear Medicine, it was originally called MAP (Maximum Activity Projection).

It was formed in 1939 and was based in Western Australia throughout the war. While it conducted many patrols over the waters off Western Australia, it did not see combat. The squadron was disbanded in December 1945. Squadron history Early years No. 14 Squadron was formed at RAAF Base Pearce near Perth, Western Australia on 6 February 1939. It was initially equipped with six Avro Anson aircraft, and conducted training exercises until the outbreak of World War II.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 43 The squadron conducted its first wartime maritime patrol on 7 September 1939. During late 1939 it also patrolled the remote coastline between Derby and Wyndham in the north of Western Australia as it was thought that German vessels might shelter there. In mid-January 1940 a detachment was deployed to Albany in the south of the state to protect a convoy carrying elements of the Second Australian Imperial Force in cooperation with No. 25 Squadron. The squadron flew in support of many subsequent troop convoys throughout the war, and deployed aircraft to Albany on other occasions.Eather (1995), p. 51 No. 14 Squadron's Ansons were replaced with Lockheed Hudsons in May 1940. The new aircraft had superior performance, and were better suited to maritime patrol tasks. The squadron continued its regular program of patrols throughout the year, though a detachment was deployed to Darwin in the Northern Territory for a period in December. From February 1941, No. 14 Squadron began to conduct anti-submarine patrols off Western Australia in addition to general reconnaissance patrols. It conducted these routine operations throughout the year, and occasionally exercised with Australian Army units.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 44 In November the squadron was heavily involved in the unsuccessful search for the light cruiser after she was sunk in a battle with the German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran. No. 14 Squadron flew more than 60 sorties during this operation, most of which were conducted from remote airstrips. Pacific War After the Pacific War began in December 1941, No. 14 Squadron stepped up its program of patrols. No Japanese submarines or warships were sighted, though on 2 March 1942 one of the squadron's Hudsons bombed and damaged the United States Navy submarine after she did not answer recognition signals. The Hudson's pilot was cleared of blame in the subsequent inquires. On 3 March, a No. 14 Squadron Hudson was destroyed by Japanese aircraft during the attack on Broome; its crew were not among the many casualties from this raid, however.Eather (1995), pp. 51‚Äì52 The squadron continued to make routine patrols throughout the remainder of 1942. In December that year it was re-equipped with Bristol Beaufort aircraft.Eather (1995), p. 52 No. 14 Squadron's duties did not change for the remainder of the war. Throughout 1943 it flew two daily patrols of the waters between Perth and Albany, as well as patrols along the coastline up to Exmouth Gulf. Two Beauforts crashed during these patrols, resulting in the death of six men.Odgers (1957), pp. 154‚Äì155 The squadron's operations were intensified in March 1943 in response to concerns that Japanese ships would conduct a raid into the Indian Ocean. In May, No. 14 Squadron conducted patrols of the waters around Exmouth Gulf while the British Eastern Fleet refueled there ahead of the Operation Transom raid against Surabaya in Java; United States Navy Consolidated PBY Catalinas and Supermarine Spitfires from No. 1 Wing RAAF also protected the fleet at this time.Odgers (1957), p. 229 On 6 January 1944 a Beaufort piloted by No. 14 Squadron's commanding officer, Wing Commander Charles Learmonth, crashed during an exercise with United States Navy warships off Rottnest Island; Learmonth and the other three airmen on board the aircraft were killed. The RAAF base at Exmouth Gulf was later named RAAF Learmonth in the wing commander's honour. The squadron's patrols were again greatly intensified in March 1944, when it was feared that a Japanese force might raid Western Australia.Odgers (1957), p. 138 In the event, the Japanese raiders sank a single ship in the central Indian Ocean before returning to base.Gill (1968), pp. 388‚Äì389 By this stage of the war, the Allies were rapidly advancing into Japanese-held territory, and the threat of attacks on shipping in Australian waters had greatly decreased. In July 1944 the United States Navy unit Patrol Wing 10, which had been based at Perth since 1942, was transferred elsewhere. This greatly increased the burden on No. 14 Squadron. The squadron was placed on alert between September and October in response to reports that German submarines might operate off Fremantle, and expanded its program of patrols.Odgers (1957), pp. 349‚Äì350 Activity was intensified from December when the German submarine attacked merchant ships off South Australia and New South Wales.Odgers (1957), p. 350 On 6 February 1945 this submarine sank the liberty ship Peter Silvester in the Indian Ocean while returning to its base in the Japanese-occupied Netherlands East Indies. Consolidated B-24 Liberators from No. 25 Squadron and Catalinas from the British No. 205 Squadron RAF responded to this attack.Odgers (1957), p. 352 The need for maritime patrols decreased during 1945. No. 25 Squadron operated solely as a heavy bomber unit from February, leaving No. 14 Squadron the only RAAF maritime patrol unit in Western Australia. Despite crew shortages, it was able to meet its commitments. The squadron ceased making regular anti-submarine patrols on 23 May 1945, though it retained responsibility for shipping protection off Western Australia in the event of any renewed enemy attacks.Odgers (1957), p. 353 Following the war, No. 14 Squadron was disbanded at Pearce on 10 December 1945.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 45 During its existence, 35 members of the squadron were killed.

Jinheung was the nephew / grandson of King Beopheung. King Jinheung was one of the greatest kings of Silla, and was responsible for expanding Silla territory immensely. He and King Seong 26th king of Baekje, struggled with each other over the Han River valley. Jinheung won this struggle and expanded Silla's territory immensely.  Rise to the throne  King Jinheung of Silla rose to the throne at a young age when his predecessor and paternal uncle / maternal grandfather, Beopheung, died. Since he was too young to rule a kingdom at the time, his mother acted as regent. When he became of age, he began to rule independently. One of his first acts as true king of Silla was to appoint a man named Kim Isabu as Head of Military Affairs, which occurred in 541. Jinheung adopted a policy of peace with the neighbouring kingdom of Baekje Kingdom. In 551, he allied with Baekje so that he could attack the northern Korean kingdom of Goguryeo. The result of this allied attack on Goguryeo was the conquest of the Han river. The kingdoms of Baekje Silla kingdom both had agreed on splitting the conquered territory equally amongst themselves.  Expansion  Stele built to honor the expedition of Silla King Jinheung in Seoul, 555 AD During the reign of King Seong of Baekje, King Jinheung allied with Goguryeo and launched an attack on the Han River valley during the year 553. In a secret agreement between Silla and Goguryeo, Silla troops attacked the exhausted Baekje army in late 553. Feeling the betrayal from Silla, King Seong attacked during the year 554, but was caught in an ambush led by a Silla general and was assassinated along with those who were accompanying him. King Jinheung guarded the new territory with a firm hand for seven years before sending General Kim Isabu to conquer Daegaya in 561. King Jinheung constructed a monument in his newly conquered territory and established provinces in the area. He subdued all rebellions and continued to develop culture in his kingdom. In 576, the Hwarang was established, and they would later play a huge role in the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.  Death and succession  King Jinheung died in 576 at the age of 51 after ruling for 37 years of conquest and advancement. King Jinheung was succeeded by his second son, Prince Geumryun, who became King Jinji of Silla.

Potteries is an English dialect of the West Midlands of England, almost exclusively in and around Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. Origin and history As with most local dialects in English, Potteries dialect derives originally from Anglo Saxon Old English. The 14th- century Anglo Saxon poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, which appears in the Cotton Nero A.x manuscript uses dialect words native to the Potteries, leading some scholars to believe that it was written by a monk from Dieulacres Abbey. However, the most commonly suggested candidate for authorship is John Massey of Cotton, CheshirePeterson, Clifford J. \\"The Pearl-Poet and John Massey of Cotton, Cheshire\\". The Review of English Studies, New Series. (1974) 25.99 pp. 257‚Äì266. (now part of Cranage outside Holmes Chapel).

ASIN B000IPU84U The first documented instance of Potteries dialect is by the prominent Staffordshire lawyer John Ward (1781‚Äì1870) and local historian Simeon Shaw in their book The Borough of Stoke-upon-Trent published in 1843, in which Ward recorded phonetically a conversation which he overheard in Burslem marketplace in 1810. In the passage, entitled A Burslem Dialogue, Ward provided an explanation of some of the words unique to the district: ‚Äòmewds‚Äô (moulds), ‚Äòkale‚Äô (being called upon in order, first, second‚Ä¶.), ‚Äòheo‚Äô (she), ‚Äòshippon‚Äô (a cow-house).

Richard Whipp. Routlidge 1990 and coal mining industries, working in close proximity in Stoke-on-Trent. This allowed the dialect to develop as a way of speech specific to those industries. Some observers of Potteries dialect in the 21st century fear it is dying out as a living speech, as fewer young people use it in everyday conversation. Steve Birks cites increased ease of travel, the decline of the pottery industry leading to people moving out of the area to find work, the prevalence of and exposure to Received Pronunciation through television and radio, and the uniformity of the British education system as contributing factors in the decline of the dialect. Alan Povey has predicted that his will be the last generation that speaks Potteries dialect, and that after his generation is gone the dialect will die out for good. However Birks points out that there have been attempts to eradicate the dialect since the 19th century which were unsuccessful. John Ward writing in 1843 noted that the Potteries dialect was \\"now almost banished by the schoolmasters assiduous care\\". Birks also writes that dialect is still used widely amongst local residents, and is toned down when speaking to visitors to the city to be intelligible to them, which shows the dialect is still present in everyday conversation. He also states that there is \\"a growing interest in preserving, reading about and speaking dialects.\\" Phonology The linguist Graham Pointon, a native of the Potteries, has noted the following phonological differences between RP and the modern Potteries accent.http://www.linguism.co.uk/language/potteries-phonology Potteries Phonology, Graham Pointon, Linguism, 26 October 2013 * There is no phoneme , although occurs as an allophone of before . Thus, singer rhymes with finger. * The three RP vowels are replaced by two, with different distributions.

The phoneme is mostly restricted to stressed word-final position (e.g. spa) and to words when an historic or has been elided (e.g. palm, farm). * H-dropping is common, and conversely any word beginning with a vowel may be emphasised with an initial . The traditional dialect differs much more from RP, but (as with all dialects in England) it is now confined to older residents. The Potteries dialect descends from the West Midlands dialect of Middle English (ME), whereas modern Standard English descends from the East Midlands dialect. * ME became in the West Midland area, so that man is pronounced , and cannot is . * ME has diphthongised in many cases to . This has been kept distinct from ME which has become a closer monophthongal vowel . Therefore, see is pronounced whereas say is pronounced . * ME has in many cases merged with ME ‚Äì wife , mice . Elsewhere it has undergone the general vowel shift to , and then simplified to and then to my wife is often called (= ‚Äúmy lady‚Äù). * ME has opened to : for example, tell is pronounced . In final , the has vocalized and the backed and risen to form a diphthong : therefore, ball is pronounced .http://www.linguism.co.uk/language/pottery-phonology-2 Potteries Phonology (2), Graham Pointon, Linguism, 3 November 2013 The traditional dialect also preserves older second person singular forms for modal verbs, such as for can you? Lexicon Like all English dialects, the Potteries dialect derives from Anglo-Saxon Old English. Example words and phrases: * \\"Nesh\\" meaning soft, tender, or to easily get cold is derived from the early English, \\"nesc, nescenes.\\" * \\"Slat\\" meaning to throw, is from the old English \\"slath,‚Äù moved. * \\"Fang\\" meaning catch or seize, as in \\"Fang 'owd of this\\" ‚Äì \\"catch hold of this\\", is from Old English \\"fang, fangen\\". It is a cognate with the modern Swedish word \\"f√•nga\\", as well as the Norwegian word \\"fange\\" and the Dutch word \\"vangen\\" and German verb \\"fangen\\", which means \\"to catch\\". * \\"Sheed\\" meaning to spill liquids, most likely derived from the word \\"shed\\" in the sense of getting rid of something. * \\"Duck\\" a common term of affection towards both men and women as in \\"Tow rate owd duck?\\". \\"Are you all right dear?\\" Duck being derived from the Saxon word \\"ducas\\" as a term of respect, which by another route is where the word \\"Duke\\" arises from in English. Duck in this context may also relate to the Roman military honorific \\"Dux\\", meaning troop or tribal leader, but it is unclear if ducas pre-dates Dux or if they are etymologically related. * \\"Spanwanned\\" (agricultural) meaning the state of being stuck astride a wall whilst attempting to climb over it. Probably from the Saxon \\"spannan winnan\\", Span Woe. * \\"Kidda\\" meaning mate, friend, or to refer to a child or family member. Compare to \\"kiddo\\" which is used in parts of North America for a similar purpose. * \\"Bank\\" meaning hill; also \\"upbank\\" and \\"downbank\\" for uphill and downhill. e.g. \\"Tine 'Ow Bank\\" (Town Hall Bank), local name for Butlers Hill in Cheadle, Staffordshire Moorlands. * \\"Bank\\" also appears as in \\"pot bank\\", which is a location where pottery is produced. * \\"Lobby\\" is a local stew similar to the Liverpudlian stew scouse. * \\"Gancie\\" is a word for a jumper/sweater, it comes from the name of the wool. * \\"Cost kick a bo agen a wo an yed it til it bosts?\\" means ... Can you kick a ball against a wall and head it until it bursts? * \\"My Lady\\" or \\"Thy lady\\", with the emphasis on the first word, refer to one's female girlfriend, partner or spouse. The \\"y\\" in My and Thy is pronounced long as \\"ah\\", so these are rendered as \\"Mar Lady\\" and \\"Thar Lady\\". In popular culture A popular cartoon called May un Mar Lady, created by Dave Follows, appears in The Sentinel newspaper and is written in the Potteries dialect. A local weekly paper, the 'Cheadle & Tean Times', also carries a short column by 'Sosh' remarking on local happenings as a monologue in Staffordshire dialect. Previously The Sentinel has carried other stories in the dialect, most notably the Jabez stories written by Wilfred Bloor under the pseudonym of A ScottThe Wilfred Bloor Papers Alan Povey's Owd Grandad Piggott stories which have aired on BBC Radio Stoke for a number of years are recited in the Potteries dialect by the author. The Potteries accent is much more difficult to imitate than the better known Cockney, Scouse, Brummie or Geordie; and few actors from outside the Potteries have managed to master it. Neither in the 1952 film \\"The Card\\" nor in the 1976 TV series \\"Clayhanger\\", did any actor give a reasonable rendition of the accent. Ken Loach's 1971 film The Rank and File was set in the Potteries and attempted to use the local dialect, but many of the actors were recruited from the film The Big Flame which was set in Liverpool and used Scouse. However, Toby Jones carried off the accent near flawlessly in the award winning film Marvellous. His father, actor Freddie Jones, was born in the Potteries.

History Parrs Wood was the 4th largest school in the UK in 2008, with 2,030 students and 450 in the sixth form centre. In 2015, the governors of Parrs Wood decided to embark on the process of turning the school into an academy, despite opposition from staff and local politicians.Labour‚Äôs policy on academies takes a tumble in Manchester It converted in 2016, the former school had community school status; its URN was 105556. After the Manchester Arena bombing, the school's choir recorded the title track from Ariana Grande's My Everything to benefit the victims. The choir then performed the song at the One Love Manchester concert with Ariana Grande herself to further honour and aid the victims. The building The original school building, built in 1967, was demolished in 2000 and was rebuilt from scratch on a site behind the original school; the contractors built the school building in exchange for a portion of the school grounds on which to build an entertainment complex. Sixth form Parrs Wood Sixth Form Centre is part of the school campus. It opened in 2000 after the rebuilding of the main school. The centre is located in a grade 2 listed building independent from the main school.  Ofsted  In 2007, an Ofsted inspection showed the school to be lacking in several areas, particularly in KS3 SAT results, and criticised the school management for failure to act to remedy the situation. The report reflected that this situation was unacceptable and the school was placed in special measures. In February 2010, OFSTED judged the school to be satisfactory and as such no longer required special measures. In its most recent inspection, the school was graded as Grade 2 - Good.  Controversy  In May 2007, a canister of CS gas was discharged in the science area of Parrs Wood, which resulted in 58 students and staff being taken to hospital. The incident was described by Greater Manchester Police as an \\"idiotic prank\\".

In 2009 the zoo was expelled from the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the main industry regulatory body, \\"for bringing the association into disrepute\\", but in 2018 it regained membership in the body. The zoo has the largest elephant enclosure in northern Europe. History Anthony Bush Noah‚Äôs Ark Zoo Farm was conceived by Anthony Bush (b. 1938), the son of a Wiltshire farm manager. Bush attended Monkton Combe School, served a stint as an officer in National Service with the Somerset Light Infantry, and attended Worcester College, Oxford, for a year before deciding to return to farming. In 1960 he became a tenant of Richard Gibbs, Lord Wraxall, at Moat House Farm, near Bristol, which Bush operated as a dairy farm. In 1962 he married Christina James, an art teacher, and they had four children.Anthony Bush, From Cows to Tigers: Building Noah's Ark (privately published, 2012), 11-62. In 1968 Bush was elected onto the Somerset County Executive Committee of the National Farmers Union, and in 1980, he began a Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group to encourage farmers to conserve wildlife.Bush, 119, 123; \\"Farmer turned zookeeper is a man with a mission\\", Bristol Post, 21 May 2012. At Monkton Combe, Bush attended Christian Union meetings and \\"asked God who I knew was out there, to forgive me and to come into my life, to be involved with everyday stuff, change me and use me\\".Bush, 23-24. Bush and wife became active at St. Philip and St. Jacob Church, helping to revive the church with a youth program. In 1967 Bush became a member of the Anglican Church Assembly, and in 1974 he and his wife established the Bristol Family Life Association, which lobbied on behalf of marriage education and against the use of obscenities on television. Later, the Bushes established Marriage Repair, a counselling service.Bush, 83, 89-94, 107; Viewer & Listener. In the early 1990s, Bush prepared for ordination as an Anglican priest, but his bishop, Jim Thompson, refused to ordain him, telling Bush he did not like his \\"theological certainly\\" (158). In 1982, Bush became director of Mission England, which organised a Billy Graham evangelistic campaign in 1985 at Ashton Gate Stadium.Bush, 126-34. In 1996 Bush also chaired a four-day evangelistic campaign in the same stadium for the Argentinian-American evangelist Luis Palau (166-67). In 1987, Bush helped found the African relief agency, Send a Cow.Bush, 145-52; Send a Cow website . Development In 1995 the Bushes purchased Moat House Farm from Wraxall, sold the Friesian herd,Bush sold the herd shortly before the BSE crisis hit and prices plummeted. Banner of Truth Trust website . and converted the farm's to arable land and sheep raising. Anthony Bush has self-published a history of the zoo, From Cows to Tigers - Building Noah's Ark (Moatwell Press, 2012). Bush began to consider creating a Noah's Ark theme park in 1997; and in 1998, he constructed a barn, a caf√©, a toilet block, and a children's play area. The park opened for a trial run in August 1998 and permanently in 1999.Bush, 201-07. At first it exhibited farm and small domestic animals as well as some exotic species such as alpacas and llamas. The collection later expanded to include tigers, African lions, white rhinos, siamang gibbons, and ring-tailed lemurs. In April 2009, a zoo webcam showed the live birth of a male Brazilian tapir. In September 2012, the zoo began building an elephant sanctuary of , and the first elephant arrived in February 2014. Before construction of the sanctuary the Born Free Foundation, which opposes holding elephants in captivity, said the acreage was too small for the purpose. The enclosure consists of a area where the elephants can sleep or shelter from the rain, and a outdoor area with a heated swimming pool. The ¬£1.8m development was partly funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and uses solar PV, biomass heating, and rainwater harvesting to provide nearly all power needed to operate the enclosure. An adjacent farm provides most of the food for the elephants.; In 2015, Noah‚Äôs Ark joined the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), which oversees management and conservation of protected species. The zoo is home to two spectacled bears (also called Andean bears), who arrived in 2016. Creationism Noah's Ark Zoo Farm was criticised by alt=The poster declares \\"Differences Between Apes and Man\\" and includes text that aims to support the creationist claim that apes and man are too different to be related. Bush and the zoo promote belief in a form of creationism as well as the Genesis flood myth Bush has said, 'From the outside, our farm is not overtly Christian. But, from the inside, we are very strongly Christian. I am a Creationist, and we see the farm as a mission station to give people scientific permission to believe in God'. and explicate these beliefs at length at \\"earthhistory.org.uk\\". Bush does not accept flood geology, a Young Earth Creationist belief that the flood described in Genesis 6-8 was an actual event that produced most fossil bearing geological strata; rather he believes the earth to be about 100,000 years old, older than the 6,000 to 10,000 years that Young Earth creationists believe it to be but much younger than its actual age of 4.54 billion years.Answers in Genesis, a young earth creationist organization, has called \\"Recolonisation Theory\\" incompatible \\"with a plain reading of Genesis\\" and complained that while proponents \\"claim to have a high view of Scripture, it is noteworthy that they have allowed their ‚Äòscience‚Äô to lead their understanding of the Bible, rather than the reverse'. Monty White and Paul S. Taylor, 'Recolonisation Theory the Latest Compromise' .Bush says \\"I'm not the kind of creationist who believes the world was created in 4,000 BC; Noah would have appeared around 20,000 BC.\\" Physical anthropologist Alice Roberts, professor of Public Engagement in Science at the University of Birmingham said the zoo had \\"absolutely nothing to do with science education\\" but noted of her visit that she saw little evidence of creationism until she entered a \\"large barn in the middle of the complex, which houses an auditorium and an impressive indoor children's play area,\\" where she found many displays promoting creationism. The zoo has been criticised by the British Centre for Science Education for \\"contradicting vast swaths of science needed to pass public examinations\\" (contrary to its claim that it supported the National Curriculum) and by Ben Goldacre, author of the Bad Science column of The Guardian. Goldacre noted the zoo's statement: \\"To follow Darwinism is to recognise only the fleshly side of our natures, and, as we know, the flesh perishes; Darwinism, in other words, is a philosophy of death\\". To which Goldacre retorted, \\"Harsh words. Bring on the darkness\\". Goldacre also said that the attraction had \\"the distinction of being the only pseudoscience zoo in the UK\\".Asked by the New Statesman in July 2011 why he did not believe in God, Goldacre replied, 'I just don't have any interest either way, but I wouldn't want to understate how uninterested I am....I'm not sure that's accurately covered by words such as \\"atheist\\", and definitely not by \\"agnostic\\". I just don't care.' . In August 2009, the British Humanist Association (after 2017 Humanists UK) urged tourist boards to stop promoting the zoo on grounds that it would \\"undermine education and the teaching of science\\", a campaign continued as recently as February 2014. (In June 2015, the BHA named Alice Roberts \\"Humanist of the Year\\", in part because she had spearheaded its complaint against Noah's Ark Zoo.) In a letter to the Anglican Church Times, the Rev. Michael Roberts, an authority on Darwin and geology and a long-time opponent of the teaching of creationism in schools, argued that the British Humanist Association was justified in criticising the zoo and that \\"church groups should have been more forthright in their criticism\\". 2009 charges of professional misconduct In October 2009 the BBC and the Captive Animals Protection Society charged that the zoo's tigers and camels belonged to the now defunct Great British Circus owned by Martin Lacey; and the zoo said a number of animals were on loan from Linctrek Ltd, a company associated with Lacey, though none had taken part in any circus performances. In December 2009, BIAZA stripped the zoo of its membership for what it claimed was a refusal of Noah's Ark to provide BIAZA requested information and for bringing \\"the association into disrepute.\\" In 2018, the zoo regained membership in BIAZA.https://biaza.org.uk/members/all. Also in 2009, the Western Animal Rights Network (WARN) and the Captive Animals Protection Society (CAPS) said that the zoo had culled healthy chickens. CAPS claimed that the zoo regularly culled animals during winter months to reduce costs. The zoo explained that it had euthanised some chickens to protect the quality of its flock. A March 2010 report of an investigation by North Somerset Council called the CAPS allegations \\"grossly unfair\\", though because zoo inspectors found some failures to comply with the Secretary of State's Standards of Modern Zoo Practice, tighter licence conditions were imposed on the zoo, including inspection by independent veterinarians every six months. Animal exhibits *Africa The first animals arrived in the African section in 2005: two South African white rhinos. A Giraffe House opened in 2006, two African lions joined the Big Cat Sanctuary in 2010, and Elephant Eden introduced its first African elephant in 2014. In 2015, Noah's Ark included four giraffes (two of which were born at NAZF), four lions, two African elephants, two white rhinos, two zebras, and a family of meerkats. *Asia In 2009, Noah's Ark introduced two Bengal tigers to the newly built 'Tiger Territory', which later became the 'Big Cat Sanctuary'. Noah's Ark Asian section is also home to yaks, water buffalo, and two Bactrian camels. *Primates Noah's Ark is home to five primate species: Siamang Gibbons, black & white ruffed lemurs, ring tailed lemurs, marmosets and cotton-top tamarins. Three of the five primates (ruffed lemurs, tamarins and gibbons) are listed on the IUCN red list as either endangered or critically endangered. The primate section has successfully bred animals since its opening, most recently a baby Siamang gibbon. (The gibbons were moved to Noah's Ark as part of the European Endangered Species Programme in 2007.) *Reptiles In July 2017 the zoo introduced seven Aldabra giant tortoises to the zoo on loan from Nigel Marven. The tortoise enclosure won an award from BIAZA for enclosure design. Maze The zoo's hedge maze, planted in 2003, is long.

Skilled construction carpenters, they opened their own construction company and in 1869 contracted to build the new Worcester high school building designed by a young architect, H.H. Richardson. From that point on the brothers became Richardson's primary contractors; ultimately, they were to build more than thirty of his designs, including three that are considered his best work, Trinity Church in Boston, Massachusetts, the Marshall Fields & Company building in Chicago, Illinois and the Allegheny County Courthouse in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Following the death of Richardson, the brothers became the contractor for many of McKim, Mead & White's projects. When MM&W; opened a new office in New York City, in 1894, the Norcross Brothers had their own space within it. As had been the case with Richardson, much of the value of the Norcross Brothers to MM&W;, and other architects derived from Orlando Norcross's engineering skill. Though largely self-taught, he had developed the skills needed to solve the vast engineering problems brought to him by his clients. For example, the size of the dome at the Rhode Island Capitol was expanded very late in the design process, perhaps even after construction had begun, so that it would be larger than the one just completed by Cass Gilbert for the Minnesota Capitol. Because of their need for stone, a primary building material of the time, was outpacing the supply the brothers eventually acquired their own stone quarries, first in Connecticut (Branford) (now on the National Register of Historic Places) and in Massachusetts, and later in Westchester County, New York and in Georgia. They also established a factory in Worcester where they manufactured architectural building parts. In all, the company is credited with completing over 650 building projects. Selected H.H.

After males are recalled up, the Turkish parliament can declare that the state is in a critical condition which makes women from ages 18 to 42 are obligated to serve.

In this system he proposed, everybody would spend 12 or 15 months in conscription. Instead of reserve officers, officers would be contracted. In October 2010, instead of the system proposed before, shortening the duration of military service is proposed. In this proposition, short-term privates would spend 4 months and other people would spend 9 months in conscription. Conscripted 250000 people would be released early. TSK, refused this system claiming it would create a shortage of soldiers. However, some people argue conscripts are forced to work for officers' private needs. This includes driving, cooking, hairdressing and serving meals in officers' clubs, teaching to officers' children. Some of the conscripts are made officers' personal assistants. Number of these conscripts are estimated to be 231,000. Attitude towards conscription, the army and conscripts (draftees) Voicing opinions against the draft is considered a social stigma in Turkey, and certain provisions in the Turkish Penal Code, such as Article 301, are often used to prosecute those who voice such opinions. By law, it is a punishable offense to speak publicly against the army or conscription, as it is a crime to \\"undermine Turkish people's zeal towards military\\" and a separate crime to \\"insult the spirit of the Armed Forces\\". Most companies require men to have completed their military service before their job candidacies can be accepted, and traditionally families do not consent to their daughters marrying men who have not served their terms. The reason behind this requirement is irregular loss of workforce; the companies are legally bound to discharge draft evaders or face legal consequences, however valuable an asset these people are. It is common opinion that having completed military service carries a symbolic value to the majority of Turks. It is commonly regarded as a rite of passage to manhood, and most men grow up with the anticipation of serving out their time. On the other hand, it is held to be one of the main reasons behind the brain drain prevalent among well-educated young professionals. An argument used in defense of conscription is that it serves to intermingle an otherwise stratified society. It is believed that going through the same hardships can make common ground amongst otherwise diverse groups and interconnect them. Conscientious objection Refusing the obligatory military service due to conscientious objection is illegal in Turkeyhttp://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/key_documents/2010/package/tr_rapport_2010_en.pdf and punishable with imprisonment by law. Upon being drafted, soldiers who refuse to serve their conscription can be convicted and made to serve their conscription period in military jail. Upon release, the offender often receives new call-up papers, and if he refuses, is sent back to serve another sentence.Amnesty International - Turkey: Fear for safety/ill treatment/legal concern/Mehmet Bal Notable objectors include Mehmet Tarhan and Osman Murat √úlke.  Sexual orientation and military service  The Military Health Regulation for the Turkish Armed Forces looks to the 1968 American Psychiatrists Association's definition of homosexuality as a disease in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual released that year. As such, homosexuals who are discharged or exempt from military service receive the same report as those who have mental or physical disabilities, and are considered to have a psychosexual disorder. In order to receive this report, individuals have to \\"prove their homosexuality,\\" undergoing what the Human Rights Watch calls \\"humiliating and degrading\\" examinations. In October 2009 the report of the EU Commission on Enlargement stated that \\"The Turkish armed forces have a health regulation which defines homosexuality as a ‚Äòpsychosexual‚Äô illness and identifies homosexuals as unfit for military service. Conscripts who declare their homosexuality have to provide photographic proof. A small number have had to undergo humiliating medical examinations.\\"http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/key_documents/2009/tr_rapport_2009_en.pdf These steps are taken, according to the military, to make sure that the system is not being exploited by deserters in order to skip mandatory military service.

Early life and family Born in Scotland on 18 October 1945 to David Myles and Janet Duncan, Myles came to New Zealand with his family as an infant. He was educated at Papanui High School. In 1971 Myles married Colleen Kirker, and the couple had two children.  Member of Parliament  He was elected to Parliament for the seat of Roskill in the 1990 election as part of the New Zealand National Party, a previously safe-seat of the previously ruling Labour Party, largely on a platform of opposition to the \\"Rogernomics\\" economic reforms that had occurred during the 1980s in New Zealand. He openly identified with the pro- interventionist 'Muldoonist' faction of the National Party, once saying \\"I joined the National Party because of Sir Robert Muldoon\\". His campaign slogan was \\"Let's rescue Roskill\\". Myles, however, quickly fell out with the leadership of the National Party (that had simultaneously become the Government) due to the party's own swing toward privatisation and the slashing of the Government's expenditure on social policy enthusiastically implemented by Finance Minister Ruth Richardson (see Ruthanasia). His disgust with the continuation of these reforms by Prime Minister Jim Bolger led to his identification with the rebels within the National Party, like Michael Laws and Winston Peters, who together had major confrontations with the dominant neo-liberals within the party's relatively gargantuan caucus.  Independent  Eventually, the total breakdown of relations between Myles and the majority of the Government led to him and another dissident, Hamish MacIntyre, breaking away to become an independent in late 1991 and then proceeding to form the Liberal Party in 1992. The party failed to gain significant popular support, with the problem being that neither of the two MPs of the party had any significant political experience but also the emergence of the left wing Alliance party and Winston Peters continuing to criticise National from within.  New Zealand First  During 1993, the Liberal Party merged with the much larger and far more left wing Alliance Party. Myles proceeded to quit the grouping within months in July, particularly over his somewhat conservative social values conflicting with the highly socially liberal policies of the Alliance. He immediately joined the populist New Zealand First party, founded by the now Independent Winston Peters. However he lost his seat during the 1993 election. Myles re-entered parliament for a brief period during 1999, following the total breakdown of the New Zealand First ‚Äì National coalition government and the resignation of former NZ First MP turned Independent minister in the National government Deborah Morris over the prioritisation of military expenditure over social expenditure in the 1999 budget. Some controversy emerged as Morris issued a tape-recorded telephone conversation between her and Myles where he admitted that he would immediately quit NZ First upon arrival in Parliament and would support the struggling Jenny Shipley-led National Government (This did not end up occurring, following threats of discipline by Peters and other NZ First party members).  Life after politics  Myles was not re-elected in the election later that year and retired from active politics. In 2011 he was found guilty on a charge of obstructing the course of justice for faking a receipt book while under investigation for fraud. He was found not guilty on the fraud charges. For the obstruction of justice charge, he was sentenced to community detention and community work. Myles has since resigned as a Justice of the Peace.

Gordon, and Sigbjorn Finne. Concurrent Haskell. ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (PoPL). 1996. (Some sections are out of date with respect to the current implementation.) Haskell 98 with explicit concurrency. Its two main underlying concepts are: * A primitive type \`MVar Œ±\` implementing a bounded/single-place asynchronous channel, which is either empty or holds a value of type \`Œ±\`. * The ability to spawn a concurrent thread via the \`forkIO\` primitive. Built atop this is a collection of useful concurrency and synchronisation abstractionsThe Haskell Hierarchical Libraries, Control.Concurrent such as unbounded channels, semaphores and sample variables. Haskell threads have very low overhead: creation, context-switching and scheduling are all internal to the Haskell runtime. These Haskell-level threads are mapped onto a configurable number of OS-level threads, usually one per processor core.  Software Transactional Memory  The software transactional memory (STM) extensionTim Harris, Simon Marlow, Simon Peyton Jones, and Maurice Herlihy. Composable Memory Transactions. ACM Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming 2005 (PPoPP'05). 2005. to GHC reuses the process forking primitives of Concurrent Haskell. STM however: * avoids \`MVar\`s in favour of \`TVar\`s. * introduces the \`retry\` and \`orElse\` primitives, allowing alternative atomic actions to be composed together.  STM monad  The STM monadControl.Concurrent.STM is an implementation of software transactional memory in Haskell. It is implemented in GHC, and allows for mutable variables to be modified in transactions. = Traditional approach = Consider a banking application as an example, and a transaction in it‚Äîthe transfer function, which takes money from one account, and puts it into another account. In the IO monad, this might look like: type Account = IORef Integer transfer :: Integer -> Account -> Account -> IO () transfer amount from to = do fromVal <\\\\- readIORef from -- (A) toVal <\\\\- readIORef to writeIORef from (fromVal - amount) writeIORef to (toVal + amount) This causes problems in concurrent situations where multiple transfers might be taking place on the same account at the same time. If there were two transfers transferring money from account \`from\`, and both calls to transfer ran line \`(A)\` before either of them had written their new values, it is possible that money would be put into the other two accounts, with only one of the amounts being transferred being removed from account \`from\`, thus creating a race condition. This would leave the banking application in an inconsistent state. A traditional solution to such a problem is locking. For instance, locks can be placed around modifications to an account to ensure that credits and debits occur atomically. In Haskell, locking is accomplished with MVars: type Account = MVar Integer credit :: Integer -> Account -> IO () credit amount account = do current <\\\\- takeMVar account putMVar account (current + amount) debit :: Integer -> Account -> IO () debit amount account = do current <\\\\- takeMVar account putMVar account (current - amount) Using such procedures will ensure that money will never be lost or gained due to improper interleaving of reads and writes to any individual account. However, if one tries to compose them together to create a procedure like transfer: transfer :: Integer -> Account -> Account -> IO () transfer amount from to = do debit amount from credit amount to a race condition still exists: the first account may be debited, then execution of the thread may be suspended, leaving the accounts as a whole in an inconsistent state. Thus, additional locks must be added to ensure correctness of composite operations, and in the worst case, one might need to simply lock all accounts regardless of how many are used in a given operation. = Atomic transactions = To avoid this, one can use the STM monad, which allows one to write atomic transactions. This means that all operations inside the transaction fully complete, without any other threads modifying the variables that our transaction is using, or it fails, and the state is rolled back to where it was before the transaction was begun. In short, atomic transactions either complete fully, or it is as if they were never run at all. The lock-based code above translates in a relatively straightforward way: type Account = TVar Integer credit :: Integer -> Account -> STM () credit amount account = do current <\\\\- readTVar account writeTVar account (current + amount) debit :: Integer -> Account -> STM () debit amount account = do current <\\\\- readTVar account writeTVar account (current - amount) transfer :: Integer -> Account -> Account -> STM () transfer amount from to = do debit amount from credit amount to The return types of \`STM ()\` may be taken to indicate that we are composing scripts for transactions. When the time comes to actually execute such a transaction, a function \`atomically :: STM a -> IO a\` is used. The above implementation will make sure that no other transactions interfere with the variables it is using (from and to) while it is executing, allowing the developer to be sure that race conditions like that above are not encountered. More improvements can be made to make sure that some other \\"business logic\\" is maintained in the system, i.e. that the transaction should not try to take money from an account until there is enough money in it: transfer :: Integer -> Account -> Account -> STM () transfer amount from to = do fromVal <\\\\- readTVar from if (fromVal - amount) >= 0 then do debit amount from credit amount to else retry Here the \`retry\` function has been used, which will roll back a transaction, and try it again. Retrying in STM is smart in that it won't try to run the transaction again until one of the variables it references during the transaction has been modified by some other transactional code. This makes the STM monad quite efficient. An example program using the transfer function might look like this: module Main where import Control.Concurrent (forkIO) import Control.Concurrent.STM import Control.Monad (forever) import System.Exit (exitSuccess) type Account = TVar Integer main = do bob <\\\\- newAccount 10000 jill <\\\\- newAccount 4000 repeatIO 2000 $ forkIO $ atomically $ transfer 1 bob jill forever $ do bobBalance <\\\\- atomically $ readTVar bob jillBalance <\\\\- atomically $ readTVar jill putStrLn (\\"Bob's balance: \\" ++ show bobBalance ++ \\", Jill's balance: \\" ++ show jillBalance) if bobBalance  8000 then exitSuccess else putStrLn \\"Trying again.\\" repeatIO :: Integer -> IO a -> IO a repeatIO 1 m = m repeatIO n m = m >> repeatIO (n - 1) m newAccount :: Integer -> IO Account newAccount amount = newTVarIO amount transfer :: Integer -> Account -> Account -> STM () transfer amount from to = do fromVal <\\\\- readTVar from if (fromVal - amount) >= 0 then do debit amount from credit amount to else retry credit :: Integer -> Account -> STM () credit amount account = do current <\\\\- readTVar account writeTVar account (current + amount) debit :: Integer -> Account -> STM () debit amount account = do current <\\\\- readTVar account writeTVar account (current - amount) which should print out \\"Bob's balance: 8000, Jill's balance: 6000\\". Here the \`atomically\` function has been used to run STM actions in the IO monad.

Significant industries that were established include paper milling, sawmilling, chemical manufacturing, refractory brick manufacture and whisky distilling. Particularly important for Bonnybridge was the establishment of several iron foundries including the famous Smith and Wellstood Foundry, which was important in introducing the American metal heating stoves to Europe under the 'Esse stoves' brand. The output from these foundries was transported via the Forth & Clyde Canal to local markets, and also to Glasgow for export. Bonnybridge was also particularly well served by rail, with the Glasgow to Edinburgh, Kilsyth and Bonnybridge and the Carlisle to Perth lines both nearby.

It was opened for goods and mineral traffic, and was extended by the Whiteinch Tramway which fed directly into the factories and works. The Whiteinch Railway was taken over by the North British Railway in 1891 and they started a passenger service on the line in 1897; the terminus was called Whiteinch (Victoria Park). After 1945 passenger and freight usage of the lines declined, and the passenger service was discontinued in 1951. The Whiteinch goods yard was later used as a construction depot for the electrification of the North Clyde passenger services, but the lines were closed completely in 1967 and nothing remains of them. History Before the Whiteinch Railway System map of the Whiteinch Railway and the Stobcross RailwayThe first railways in Glasgow were located on the east side of the city, and were concerned with transporting minerals. In 1832 the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway opened to a terminus at Townhead, bringing coal from the Monklands coalfield to the city. The Polloc and Govan Railway was an 1840 development of an earlier waggonway, improved to get access to shipping on the south bank of the Clyde at Broomielaw (a name then applied to the area both sides of the river). In 1842 the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway opened its intercity line to Edinburgh. The north bank of the Clyde was not developed for some time, and railway access was difficult. The main lines built at the end of the decade ran east and south, and although construction through, and under, the central area was proposed, opposition was so strong that it was not carried out. The Glasgow, Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway (GD&HR;) was opened in 1858, but it ran in a broad northern sweep round the city, through Maryhill (then a remote small town) and did not approach the Clyde until it reached Bowling. The Queen's Dock Heavy industry expanded in subsequent years and there was pressure to move west of the city where land was available and access to the Clyde was easier. At the same time, berthing of ships in Broomielaw was becoming difficult as shipping volumes, and vessel sizes, increased, and the Clyde Commissioners determined to build a new dock on the north bank west of the city. Work was started in 1872 at Stobcross, and the new dock, to be known as \\"The Queen's Dock\\" was formally opened on 18 September 1877. The Stobcross Railway By this time the GD&HR; had been taken over by the North British Railway. The creation of the new dock was obviously of fundamental concern to the company, and it secured Parliamentary authority for a line to Stobcross to serve the dock. The line, known as the Stobcross Railway, branched from the GD&HR; at Maryhill (Stobcross Junction), and it opened on 20 October 1874. Whiteinch Some industrial development had taken place in about 1870 at Whiteinch, a mile or so west of Stobcross, on the north bank of the Clyde. There was no rail access to the sites and the promotion of the Stobcross line encouraged the idea of providing a line. The Whiteinch Railway was proposed and obtained its authorising Act on 1 July 1872.Awdry page 171. It was to connect at a new Whiteinch Junction and run west and then south to a goods yard (\\"Whiteinch Goods and Mineral Station\\") on the north side of Dumbarton Road. Whiteinch Junction was located about halfway between the present-day Hyndland and Jordanhill stations, opposite the end of Woodcroft Avenue. The course of the line was dictated by the contours. The construction was partly funded by local industrialists and landowners, all of whom had an interest in the benefits of the line. It opened on 29 October 1874. The Whiteinch Tramway was authorised on the same date as the Whiteinch Railway, and became operational on the same day as the railway. It ran from the Whiteinch goods depot and crossed Dumbarton Road, then turning east along what became South Street (but at the time simply through fields) to serve the industrial premises. The tramway was horse operated, wagons being worked to and from the railway yard. The tramway was worked by James and William Wood who traded as merchants in coal, sand and iron products, using the tramway as a subsidiary part of their business. The traffic was sufficient to enable the purchase of a locomotive in 1875. The Glasgow, Yoker and Clydebank Railway In 1882 the Glasgow, Yoker and Clydebank Railway opened. It left the Stobcross Railway at Yoker Junction, a little to the west of Whiteinch Junction, and ran west from there just to the north of the first section of the Whiteinch Railway. (Yoker Junction later became the eastern apex of the triangle at Jordanhill.) Passenger traffic The North British Railway worked the Whiteinch Railway, and it aspired to incorporate it and the tramway into its own system. This was resisted locally, until in 1891 the NBR agreed a purchase of the Whiteinch Railway, but not the tramway. In due course the NBR converted the Whiteinch Railway into a passenger branch, and next to Whiteinch goods yard they built Whiteinch (Victoria Park) passenger station. It opened on 1 January 1897. there were no intermediate stations on the short branch. The Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire Railway In 1896 the Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire Railway (L&DR;) (the company name used the variant spelling of Dumbartonshire) opened its line; it was sponsored by the rival Caledonian Railway and ran along the north bank of the River Clyde, giving a much improved service to industrial premises than the Wood Brothers' tramway. The finances of the tramway declined and in May 1914 the Wood Brothers went into liquidation. A and G Anderson took over the local management of the line, but the North British Railway stepped in and the railway operations were effectively controlled by them, with Anderson handling the merchant activity. In 1916 the NBR took over the working of the tramway completely. Closed to passengers After World War II social patterns changed and at the same time road transport, for goods and for passengers, had improved significantly and on 2 April 1951 the passenger service to Whiteinch was withdrawn. Goods traffic continued until closure in March 1965. The North Clyde passenger train network was electrified in 1960 and the construction work in connection with it had been carried out over several preceding years. An electrification depot was established in Whiteinch goods yard for the purpose. The depot continued as a maintenance depot until 1967. The line today The whole of the Whiteinch Railway and the Whiteinch Tramway has been closed and Whiteinch goods yard has been landscaped and is open ground; the Dumbarton Road frontage is now occupied by residential accommodation.

Baluze had begun a similar work, but only the first volume had appeared. Coleti's collection was based on that of Labbe, though he used Baluze and Hardouin. It was published by his brother Sebastiano from 1728 to 1733 in twenty-three volumes.

August Alexander J√§rnefelt (2 April 1833 ‚Äì 15 April 1896) was a Finnish general, topographist, governor and senator. Aleksander J√§rnefelt was born in Tohmaj√§rvi, the son of crown overseer Gustav Adolf J√§rnefelt and Aurora Fredrika Molander. Aleksander married Elisabeth Clodt von J√ºrgensburg on 22 December 1857 in Saint Petersburg. Their children were Kasper, Arvid, Erik, Ellida, Ellen, Armas, Aino, Hilja and Sigrid. Armas, Arvid and Eero were famous Finnish cultural figures. Aino J√§rnefelt was married to composer Jean Sibelius. After seven year's study in Hamina Cadet School, J√§rnefelt embarked on a career as an artillery officer in the Russian Army. After working under Wilhelm von Struve at Pulkovo Observatory, J√§rnefelt was commanded to topographic works in his native Finland which formed his main occupation for decades. By 1870, he was the head if the Russian topographic corps in Finland. During and after the Turkish war (1877‚Äì1879), J√§rnefelt lead the topographic survey of many areas which Russia conquered from Turkey. These works, on which he also wrote a German-language scientific treatise Die astronomischen, geod√§tischen und topographischen Arbeiten auf der Balkanhalbinsel in der Jahren 1877, 1878 und 1879, earned him a promotion to general major. Politically, J√§rnefelt was a fennoman of the Old Finnish Party. The party strove for the equal rights of Finnish language with the Swedish while stressing the importance of loyalty to the Emperor. J√§rnefelt took these aims seriously, sending his children to Finnish-speaking schools which was extraordinary for a nobleman of his time. In the 1880s, J√§rnefelt was transferred from the military to a civilian administrative career, which allowed him to further his political agenda. J√§rnefelt was the governor of Mikkeli Province in the 1883‚Äì84, the governor of Kuopio Province in 1884‚Äì88 and Vaasa Province in 1888‚Äì94. During these tenures, J√§rnefelt used his gubernatorial powers to change the language of civil administration of these provinces to Finnish (in the bilingual Vaasa Province, to bilingualism). In addition, he strove to establish primary schools and poor-houses in his provinces. J√§rnefelt's career culminated in the membership of the Senate of Finland, where J√§rnefelt was tasked as the chief of the military affair's section. The promotion to senator was accompanied with promotion to the rank of a lieutenant general. J√§rnefelt died at Helsinki on 15 April 1896, of paralysis. References *Kopponen, T.

He attended Wesley College, a prestigious Dublin school run by his maternal uncle Gerald Myles. Upon graduating he joined a host of notable alumni such as playwright George Bernard Shaw and Chaim Herzog, the sixth President of Israel. In the late 1950s, FitzGerald emerged as a pioneer of scuba diving in Ireland. FitzGerald's work in the fledgling field of underwater photography unveiled and displayed the marine life of the Irish coastline to a wondrous audience. At a time when the Irish authorities had no diving capability, FitzGerald was often summoned to lead dives on behalf of the government. FitzGerald began his business career as a trainee in a small accounting firm. Following a series of mergers, FitzGerald quickly rose through the ranks and was ultimately appointed the head partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers. In the 1980s, as the Irish economy was experiencing a crippling recession, FitzGerald emerged as a leading insolvency practitioner. His business reputation flourished after a string of successes in rescuing failing businesses. In 1986, FitzGerald was the defendant in a landmark legal case brought by Irish tobacco giant Carroll Group. The court issued judgement in favor of FitzGerald.

Its main purpose in many animals is to supply vital proteins to the cell. It is formed by follicle cells adhering to the oocyte before it leaves the ovarian follicle, and originates from the squamous granulosa cells present at the primordial stage of follicular development. The corona radiata is formed when the granulosa cells enlarge and become cuboidal, which occurs during the transition from the primordial to primary stage. These cuboidal granulosa cells, also known as the granulosa radiata, form more layers throughout the maturation process, and remain attached to the zona pellucida after the ovulation of the Graafian follicle. For fertilization to occur, sperm cells rely on hyaluronidase (an enzyme found in the acrosome of spermatozoa) to disperse the corona radiata from the zona pellucida of the secondary (ovulated) oocyte, thus permitting entry into the perivitelline space and allowing contact between the sperm cell and the nucleus of the oocyte.

Ryska tiden (2009). Life Elisabeth's parents were the general and wood engraver Konstantin Karlovitj Clodt von J√ºrgensburg and Catharina Vign√©. She was educated first at a girls school and then at home, and raised in Saint Petersburg in Russia. Elisabeth married August Aleksander J√§rnefelt on 22 December 1857 at Saint Petersburg, and settled with him in Helsinki in Finland. Their children were Kasper, Arvid, Erik, Ellida, Ellen, Armas, Aino, Hilja and Sigrid. Armas, Arvid and Erik were famous Finnish cultural figures. Daughter Aino J√§rnefelt was married to composer Jean Sibelius. Elisabeth J√§rnefelt was also a good friend of the writer Juhani Aho. Her marriage was not a happy one. After the birth of their last child, her spouse decided to live in chastity: he was described as a strict patriarch who disliked spending money, and Elisabeth J√§rnefelt was reportedly forced to ask friends and relatives for loans to manage the household economy because her refused to give her enough funds. Eventually, the couple spent as much time away from each other as possible: from 1876 onward, they spoke only through messages delivered by their children. Both of them, however, continued to have a good relationship with their children despite their personal relationship. It is possible that she had an affair with Johannes Brofeldt (also called Juhani Aho) in the 1880s, but never confirmed. Elisabeth J√§rnefelt became a central figure of Finnish culture as the host of a literary salon in Helsinki, referred to as \\"J√§rnefelts skola\\" (J√§rnefelt School), centered around Scandinavian, Finnish and Russian literature. It was also the center of discussion of politics, religion and equality. When her sons was at university, her salon became a center of the Fennoman movement of Finnish nationalism, the association K.P.T. or \\"koko programmi toimeen\\", which worked to introduce the Finnish language in then Russian Finland, were the Swedish language was leading in the upper classes. The \\"Elisabeths krets\\" (Elisabeth Circle), as the salon was also called, is regarded as the starting point of the modern Finnish language realism and the first Finnish language writers. She was a follower of the Tolstoyan movement, likely the first in Finland. She closed her salon when her spouse moved to Vasa in the end of the 1880s. After the death of her spouse in 1896, she bought her own farm, Vierem√§, where she lived until she moved in with her widowed son Kasper in 1906, with whom she lived the rest of her life.

His feast day is the day of his death, 15 February. He was a missionary and ascetical writer. Colombi√®re left a large number of writings, including his principal works, Pious Reflections, Meditations on the Passion, and Retreat and Spiritual Letters. Life Early life He was born in 1641 in the city of Saint-Symphorien-d'Ozon, then in the ancient Province of Dauphin√©, the third child of the notary Bertrand La Colombi√®re and of Margaret Coindat. The family soon moved to the nearby city of Vienne, where he began his education, before attending the Jesuit school in Lyon for his secondary studies. In 1658, at the age of seventeen, Colombi√®re entered the novitiate of the Society of Jesus at Avignon. He did this despite what he recorded as \\"a terrible aversion for the life embraced\\". When he completed the two-year novitiate, he started his higher studies in the same city. He was professed there and completed his studies. After this he spent the next five years of his regency teaching grammar and literature at the same school. Jesuit ministry Colombi√®re was sent to Paris in 1666 to study theology at the College de Clermont. He was also assigned to be the tutor of the children of the Royal Minister of Finances, Jean-Baptiste Colbert. After completing his studies there, he was ordained a priest and initially assigned to teach at his former school in Lyon. He then was assigned to join the preaching team of the Jesuit community, through which he gained notice for the clarity and soundness of his sermons. In 1674, after 15 years of life as a Jesuit, Colombi√®re did his next period of probation known as the tertianship, which was to prove decisive in his life. As a result of this experience of the Spiritual Exercises, he made a personal vow, as a means of attaining the utmost possible perfection, to observe faithfully the Rule and Constitutions of the Society under penalty of sin. Those who lived with him attested that this vow was kept with great exactitude. The Sacred Heart After professing the Fourth Vow of the Society at the end of his tertianship on 2 February 1675, Colombi√®re was appointed the rector of the Jesuit community at Paray-le-Monial, where he also became the spiritual director of the nuns of the Monastery of the Visitation Sisters located next to the church. In this way he came to know Sr. Margaret Mary Alacoque. The curiosity of such a promising preacher having been assigned to this remote location has led to the supposition that his superiors had her in mind in making this assignment. Alacoque had suffered greatly from the disbelief of the other religious sisters of her monastery, and felt isolated in her situation of having experienced a series of private revelations from Christ in which she felt she was being called to promote devotion to his Sacred Heart. When Colombi√®re came to the community and began to hear the confessions of the sisters, she felt that she had finally found a priest in whom she could truly confide, and opened up her heart to him. She later wrote that she saw that his spiritual gift \\"was that of bringing souls to God along the Gospel way of love and mercy which Christ revealed to us\\". After speaking with her a number of times and after much prayer, as a result, he was convinced of the validity of her visions and became both her supporter and a zealous apostle of the devotion. England In 1676 Colombi√®re was sent to England as preacher to Mary of Modena, then the Duchess of York, wife of the future King James II of England. He took up residence at the Court of St. James, where he still observed all his religious duties as a member of the Society. He was also as active a preacher and confessor in England as he had been in France. Although encountering many difficulties, he was able to guide Alacoque by letter. Colombi√®re's zeal and the English climate soon combined to weaken his health and a pulmonary condition threatened to end his work in that country. In November 1678, while awaiting a recall to France, he was suddenly arrested and thrown into prison, denounced as being a part of the Popish Plot alleged by Titus Oates against the English throne. Caught up in the anti- Catholic hysteria which resulted from this alleged plot, he was confined in severe conditions at the King's Bench Prison, where his fragile health took a turn for the worse. He is quoted by the historian John Philipps Kenyon as having described the effects of the situation‚Äîin which over 20 Jesuits died‚Äîon the Society of Jesus, writing: > \\"The name of the Jesuit is hated above all else, even by priests both > secular and regular, and by the Catholic laity as well, because it is said > that the Jesuits have caused this raging storm, which is likely to overthrow > the whole Catholic religion\\". Thanks to his position at the Royal Court and to the protection of the King of France, Louis XIV, whose subject he was, he escaped death but was expelled from England in 1679. He returned to France with his health ruined by his imprisonment. Death and veneration The last two years of Colombi√®re's life were spent at Lyon, where he was spiritual director to the Jesuit novices, and at Paray-le-Monial, where he returned to improve his health. He died on 15 February 1682, as a result of a severe hemorrhage. Colombi√®re left a large number of writings, which, including his principal works, Pious Reflections, Meditations on the Passion, and Retreat and Spiritual Letters, were published under the title, Oeuvres du R.P.

After literary, philosophical and theological studies, he successively taught classes of rhetoric and philosophy. He then held the chair of theology for five years. His memory was quick and retentive, his erudition extensive and accurate. He expressed his devotion to Christ and the Virgin Mary in elegant Latin verse. Labbe wrote more than 80 literary, philosophical and theological works. Every year witnessed the production of one or more of his works, so that in the field of history Labbe and Denis P√©tau have been considered the most remarkable of all French Jesuits. In 1647 Nicolas Sanson accused the Jesuit Labbe of plagiarizing him in his Pharus Galliae Antiquae; his accusation was published in Sanson's In Pharum Galliae antiquae Philippi L'Abbe disquisitiones (1647‚Äì1648).

Since 1 April 2006 it has been a division of the NHS Business Services Authority, a special health authority of the Department of Health of the United Kingdom. It was formerly known as the NHS Counter Fraud and Security Management Service (NHS CFSMS). The NHS CFSMS comprises the NHS Security Management Service (NHS SMS) which develops strategy for improving security in the NHS, and the NHS Counter Fraud Service (NHS CFS), which implements policy on protecting NHS resources from fraud.  The NHS Counter Fraud Service  The NHS Counter Fraud Service was set up in 1998 as part of the Department of Health under the leadership of Jim Gee. The organisation set about discovering the scale of fraud against the NHS, what types of crime were involved and how much money might be being lost to the NHS. The next step was to set up an operational department to investigate cases of fraud and help the police and Crown Prosecution Service bring them to justice. It was discovered that fraud was being carried out by patients, NHS staff and professionals and contractors. Examples included patients using false identities to gain large numbers of prescriptions for drugs, NHS staff members claiming for shifts they had not done, managers inflating expenses and contractors such as opticians and dentists claiming for services they had not provided. From 1999-2006 it was estimated that counter fraud work in the NHS benefited the public purse by ¬£811 million. This could pay for 53,000 kidney transplants or 35,000 nurses for a year. Successes include the investigations into a General practitioner who did private work while off sick from the NHS, who was jailed for 12 months, a manager at a major hospital trust who was jailed for four years for creating fake employees in order to claim their salaries and a bogus psychiatrist who faked his qualifications, jailed for ten years. He lived a lavish lifestyle which included a 5 bedroom house, 30 Armani suits and a Ferrari. Under controversial plans, he was allowed back on duty and maintain the organisations ¬£59 million budget. The NHS Counter Fraud Service has also helped the NHS to fraud proof its systems leading to much lower rates of fraud than occurred in the past.  The NHS Security Management Service  The NHS Security Management Service was set up alongside the NHS Counter Fraud Service to build on the successes of the latter by extending the remit to security issues. As part of a new Special Health Authority the NHS SMS has begun to introduce the first ever national strategy for security in the NHS, which involves measures to protect staff in England against violence and abuse, prevent theft and damage to equipment and property, ensure the security of drugs and medicines and protect maternity and paediatric units. The NHS SMS set about ensuring that every health body appointed a Local Security Management Specialist, trained and accredited by the NHS SMS, so that health bodies would be able to focus on the issues that affected them locally. In addition, the NHS SMS set up a Legal Protection Unit which provides cost effective legal advice to the NHS on pursuing sanctions against offenders and if necessary can pursue prosecutions. In 2004‚Äì2006, the rate of prosecution for people who assault NHS staff had gone up to 16 times what it had been in 2002-2003 (850 against 51), and increased again to 869 in 2006‚Äì2007. In November 2007 it was revealed that there had been 55,709 physical assaults against NHS staff in England, 2,986 fewer than 2005-2006 and 4,586 fewer than 2004‚Äì2005. In April 2004, the NHS SMS launched the biggest ever training programme in NHS history. Conflict Resolution Training aims to train 750,000 frontline NHS staff members in techniques to manage and prevent violence, looking at methods of communication, cultural awareness, environment and how to de-escalate violent situations as well as how to avoid being physically assaulted if de-escalation fails. The NHS SMS has also contributed to trials of technology to help protect NHS staff and assets. This includes assisting with the Safer Hospitals Programme to develop environments which can help to reduce violence, and trialling a device for lone workers which will enable them to discreetly call for help to a response centre if in danger and give details as to their location, as well as recording evidence that can be used to prosecute offenders.

The swing was accessed by way of the alley behind Queen Street West, which is known as one of Toronto's best graffiti galleries. Toronto artist Corwyn Lund erected the swing in September 2003 as part of a group show called 'Psychotopes' at YYZ Artists Outlet. As part of that show, Lund made and displayed a video about the installation. Nicknamed the Secret Swing, its location became more widely known when Toronto bloggers began posting pictures of it online and a number of articles appeared in local newspapers. It has since become a cult icon among street artists and the youth of Toronto. It was located in the alley behind the store fronts on the south side of Queen Street, about a block west of Spadina Avenue. In November 2005, the swing's seat and two feet of the swing's chains were removed. This was supposedly the work of vandals. Two people named Vince and Kai replaced it on December 13 of the same year. The new swing seat bore a date, signatures, and has writing on it: ‚ÄúThe Secret Swing belongs to the people of Toronto.‚Äù The swing installation came to an end in March 2006 when both the swing and the bar holding it up were removed and a fence installed to block the entrance to the space where the swing was installed.

In TCD, normal thalamocortical resonance is disrupted by changes in the behaviour of neurons in the thalamus. TCD can be treated with neurosurgical methods like the central lateral thalamotomy, which due to its invasiveness is only used on patients that have proven resistant to conventional therapies. Background At the base of the theory lies diminished excitatory or increased inhibitory input at the thalamic level. This leads to a switch of the thalamocortical neurons from tonic to burst firing and subsequently entrains thalamic and cortical areas with pathological oscillations at around 5 Hz. Evidence Evidence for TCD comes from Magnetoencephalography (MEG), and Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings on the scalp as well as local field potential (LFP) recordings in the patients' thalamus during surgery. Analysing the power spectra reveals increased coherence as well as increased bicoherence in the power spectra in the theta band compared to healthy controls. This indicates a close coupling of cortex and thalamus in the generation of the pathological theta rhythmicity. The thalamic loss of input or gated activity allows the frequency of the thalamo-cortical column to slow into the theta or delta band, and this defeats the lateral inhibition, so faster Gamma band activity appears surrounding the area of slower alpha seen in the theta band, with the theta associated with negative symptoms and the Gamma for positive symptoms. This is documented in Tinnitus (phantom sound) and phantom pain, as well as Parkinsonism and recently even in depression (see current work by Dirk DeRidder, MD, PhD). The thalamocoherence was identified by machine learning, with significant differentiation of each of these clinical entities from normal by the presence of the dysrhythmia, and with the specific disorder differentiated by the spatial/topographic networks involved. It was also proposed that psychotic disorders present in Parkinson disease‚Äêdementia with Lewy bodies depend on thalamic abnormal rhythms. Therapy While it is not clear how this happens in detail, surgical intervention by means of lesioning small parts of the central lateral thalamic areas has proven successful as a therapy for Parkinson's Disease as well as neurogenic pain. Neurofeedback, where the brain is trained to emphasise and de-emphasise brain wave frequencies, amplitudes and coherence can be an effective noninvasive therapy.

A constraint logic program is a logic program that contains constraints in the body of clauses. An example of a clause including a constraint is . In this clause, is a constraint; \`A(X,Y)\`, \`B(X)\`, and \`C(Y)\` are literals as in regular logic programming. This clause states one condition under which the statement \`A(X,Y)\` holds: \`X+Y\` is greater than zero and both \`B(X)\` and \`C(Y)\` are true. As in regular logic programming, programs are queried about the provability of a goal, which may contain constraints in addition to literals. A proof for a goal is composed of clauses whose bodies are satisfiable constraints and literals that can in turn be proved using other clauses. Execution is performed by an interpreter, which starts from the goal and recursively scans the clauses trying to prove the goal. Constraints encountered during this scan are placed in a set called constraint store. If this set is found out to be unsatisfiable, the interpreter backtracks, trying to use other clauses for proving the goal. In practice, satisfiability of the constraint store may be checked using an incomplete algorithm, which does not always detect inconsistency. Overview Formally, constraint logic programs are like regular logic programs, but the body of clauses can contain constraints, in addition to the regular logic programming literals. As an example, \`X>0\` is a constraint, and is included in the last clause of the following constraint logic program. B(X,1):- X<0\\\\. B(X,Y):- X=1, Y>0. A(X,Y):- X>0, B(X,Y). Like in regular logic programming, evaluating a goal such as \`A(X,1)\` requires evaluating the body of the last clause with \`Y=1\`. Like in regular logic programming, this in turn requires proving the goal \`B(X,1)\`. Contrary to regular logic programming, this also requires a constraint to be satisfied: \`X>0\`, the constraint in the body of the last clause (in regular logic programming, X>0 cannot be proved unless X is bound to a fully ground term and execution of the program will fail if that is not the case). Whether a constraint is satisfied cannot always be determined when the constraint is encountered. In this case, for example, the value of \`X\` is not determined when the last clause is evaluated. As a result, the constraint \`X>0\` is not satisfied nor violated at this point. Rather than proceeding in the evaluation of \`B(X,1)\` and then checking whether the resulting value of \`X\` is positive afterwards, the interpreter stores the constraint \`X>0\` and then proceeds in the evaluation of \`B(X,1)\`; this way, the interpreter can detect violation of the constraint \`X>0\` during the evaluation of \`B(X,1)\`, and backtrack immediately if this is the case, rather than waiting for the evaluation of \`B(X,1)\` to conclude. In general, the evaluation of a constraint logic program proceeds as does a regular logic program. However, constraints encountered during evaluation are placed in a set called a constraint store. As an example, the evaluation of the goal \`A(X,1)\` proceeds by evaluating the body of the first clause with \`Y=1\`; this evaluation adds \`X>0\` to the constraint store and requires the goal \`B(X,1)\` to be proven. While trying to prove this goal, the first clause is applied but its evaluation adds \`X<0\` to the constraint store. This addition makes the constraint store unsatisfiable. The interpreter then backtracks, removing the last addition from the constraint store. The evaluation of the second clause adds \`X=1\` and \`Y>0\` to the constraint store. Since the constraint store is satisfiable and no other literal is left to prove, the interpreter stops with the solution \`X=1, Y=1\`. Semantics The semantics of constraint logic programs can be defined in terms of a virtual interpreter that maintains a pair \\\\langle G,S \\\\rangle during execution. The first element of this pair is called current goal; the second element is called constraint store. The current goal contains the literals the interpreter is trying to prove and may also contain some constraints it is trying to satisfy; the constraint store contains all constraints the interpreter has assumed satisfiable so far. Initially, the current goal is the goal and the constraint store is empty. The interpreter proceeds by removing the first element from the current goal and analyzing it. The details of this analysis are explained below, but in the end this analysis may produce a successful termination or a failure. This analysis may involve recursive calls and addition of new literals to the current goal and new constraint to the constraint store. The interpreter backtracks if a failure is generated. A successful termination is generated when the current goal is empty and the constraint store is satisfiable. The details of the analysis of a literal removed from the goal is as follows. After having removed this literal from the front of the goal, it is checked whether it is a constraint or a literal. If it is a constraint, it is added to the constraint store. If it is a literal, a clause whose head has the same predicate of the literal is chosen; the clause is rewritten by replacing its variables with new variables (variables not occurring in the goal): the result is called a fresh variant of the clause; the body of the fresh variant of the clause is then placed in front of the goal; the equality of each argument of the literal with the corresponding one of the fresh variant head is placed in front of the goal as well. Some checks are done during these operations. In particular, the constraint store is checked for consistency every time a new constraint is added to it. In principle, whenever the constraint store is unsatisfiable the algorithm could backtrack. However, checking unsatisfiability at each step would be inefficient. For this reason, an incomplete satisfiability checker may be used instead. In practice, satisfiability is checked using methods that simplify the constraint store, that is, rewrite it into an equivalent but simpler-to-solve form. These methods can sometimes but not always prove unsatisfiability of an unsatisfiable constraint store. The interpreter has proved the goal when the current goal is empty and the constraint store is not detected unsatisfiable. The result of execution is the current set of (simplified) constraints. This set may include constraints such as X=2 that force variables to a specific value, but may also include constraints like X>2 that only bound variables without giving them a specific value. Formally, the semantics of constraint logic programming is defined in terms of derivations. A transition is a pair of pairs goal/store, noted \\\\langle G,S \\\\rangle \\\\rightarrow \\\\langle G',S' \\\\rangle. Such a pair states the possibility of going from state \\\\langle G,S \\\\rangle to state \\\\langle G',S' \\\\rangle. Such a transition is possible in three possible cases: * an element of is a constraint , G'=G \\\\backslash \\\\\\\\{C\\\\\\\\} and S'=S \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{C\\\\\\\\}; in other words, a constraint can be moved from the goal to the constraint store * an element of is a literal L(t_1,\\\\ldots,t_n), there exists a clause that, rewritten using new variables, is L(t_1',\\\\ldots,t_n') :- B, G' is with L(t_1,\\\\ldots,t_n) replaced by t_1=t_1',\\\\ldots,t_n=t_n',B, and S'=S; in other words, a literal can be replaced by the body of a fresh variant of a clause having the same predicate in the head, adding the body of the fresh variant and the above equalities of terms to the goal * and S' are equivalent according to the specific constraint semantics A sequence of transitions is a derivation. A goal can be proved if there exists a derivation from \\\\langle G, \\\\emptyset \\\\rangle to \\\\langle \\\\emptyset, S \\\\rangle for some satisfiable constraint store . This semantics formalizes the possible evolutions of an interpreter that arbitrarily chooses the literal of the goal to process and the clause to replace literals. In other words, a goal is proved under this semantics if there exists a sequence of choices of literals and clauses, among the possibly many ones, that lead to an empty goal and satisfiable store. Actual interpreters process the goal elements in a LIFO order: elements are added in the front and processed from the front. They also choose the clause of the second rule according to the order in which they are written, and rewrite the constraint store when it is modified. The third possible kind of transition is a replacement of the constraint store with an equivalent one. This replacement is limited to those done by specific methods, such as constraint propagation. The semantics of constraint logic programming is parametric not only to the kind of constraints used but also to the method for rewriting the constraint store. The specific methods used in practice replace the constraint store with one that is simpler to solve. If the constraint store is unsatisfiable, this simplification may detect this unsatisfiability sometimes, but not always. The result of evaluating a goal against a constraint logic program is defined if the goal is proved. In this case, there exists a derivation from the initial pair to a pair where the goal is empty. The constraint store of this second pair is considered the result of the evaluation. This is because the constraint store contains all constraints assumed satisfiable to prove the goal. In other words, the goal is proved for all variable evaluations that satisfy these constraints. The pairwise equality of terms of two literals is often compactly denoted by L(t_1,\\\\ldots,t_n)=L(t_1',\\\\ldots,t_n'): this is a shorthand for the constraints t_1=t_1',\\\\ldots,t_n=t_n'. A common variant of the semantics for constraint logic programming adds L(t_1,\\\\ldots,t_n)=L(t_1',\\\\ldots,t_n') directly to the constraint store rather than to the goal. Terms and conditions Different definitions of terms are used, generating different kinds of constraint logic programming: over trees, reals, or finite domains. A kind of constraint that is always present is the equality of terms. Such constraints are necessary because the interpreter adds \`t1=t2\` to the goal whenever a literal \`P(...t1...)\` is replaced with the body of a clause fresh variant whose head is \`P(...t2...)\`. Tree terms Constraint logic programming with tree terms emulates regular logic programming by storing substitutions as constraints in the constraint store. Terms are variables, constants, and function symbols applied to other terms. The only constraints considered are equalities and disequalities between terms. Equality is particularly important, as constraints like \`t1=t2\` are often generated by the interpreter. Equality constraints on terms can be simplified, that is solved, via unification: A constraint \`t1=t2\` can be simplified if both terms are function symbols applied to other terms. If the two function symbols are the same and the number of subterms is also the same, this constraint can be replaced with the pairwise equality of subterms. If the terms are composed of different function symbols or the same functor but on different number of terms, the constraint is unsatisfiable. If one of the two terms is a variable, the only allowed value the variable can take is the other term. As a result, the other term can replace the variable in the current goal and constraint store, thus practically removing the variable from consideration. In the particular case of equality of a variable with itself, the constraint can be removed as always satisfied. In this form of constraint satisfaction, variable values are terms. Reals Constraint logic programming with real numbers uses real expressions as terms. When no function symbols are used, terms are expressions over reals, possibly including variables. In this case, each variable can only take a real number as a value. To be precise, terms are expressions over variables and real constants. Equality between terms is a kind of constraint that is always present, as the interpreter generates equality of terms during execution. As an example, if the first literal of the current goal is \`A(X+1)\` and the interpreter has chosen a clause that is \`A(Y-1):-Y=1\` after rewriting is variables, the constraints added to the current goal are \`X+1=Y-1\` and Y=1. The rules of simplification used for function symbols are obviously not used: \`X+1=Y-1\` is not unsatisfiable just because the first expression is built using \`+\` and the second using \`-\`. Reals and function symbols can be combined, leading to terms that are expressions over reals and function symbols applied to other terms. Formally, variables and real constants are expressions, as any arithmetic operator over other expressions. Variables, constants (zero-arity-function symbols), and expressions are terms, as any function symbol applied to terms. In other words, terms are built over expressions, while expressions are built over numbers and variables. In this case, variables ranges over real numbers and terms. In other words, a variable can take a real number as a value, while another takes a term. Equality of two terms can be simplified using the rules for tree terms if none of the two terms is a real expression. For example, if the two terms have the same function symbol and number of subterms, their equality constraint can be replaced with the equality of subterms. Finite domains The third class of constraints used in constraint logic programming is that of finite domains. Values of variables are in this case taken from a finite domain, often that of integer numbers. For each variable, a different domain can be specified: \`X::[1..5]\` for example means that the value of \`X\` is between \`1\` and \`5\`. The domain of a variable can also be given by enumerating all values a variable can take; therefore, the above domain declaration can be also written \`X::[1,2,3,4,5]\`. This second way of specifying a domain allows for domains that are not composed of integers, such as \`X::[george,mary,john]\`. If the domain of a variable is not specified, it is assumed to be the set of integers representable in the language. A group of variables can be given the same domain using a declaration like \`[X,Y,Z]::[1..5]\`. The domain of a variable may be reduced during execution. Indeed, as the interpreter adds constraints to the constraint store, it performs constraint propagation to enforce a form of local consistency, and these operations may reduce the domain of variables. If the domain of a variable becomes empty, the constraint store is inconsistent, and the algorithm backtracks. If the domain of a variable becomes a singleton, the variable can be assigned the unique value in its domain. The forms of consistency typically enforced are arc consistency, hyper-arc consistency, and bound consistency. The current domain of a variable can be inspected using specific literals; for example, \`dom(X,D)\` finds out the current domain \`D\` of a variable \`X\`. As for domains of reals, functors can be used with domains of integers. In this case, a term can be an expression over integers, a constant, or the application of a functor over other terms. A variable can take an arbitrary term as a value, if its domain has not been specified to be a set of integers or constants. The constraint store The constraint store contains the constraints that are currently assumed satisfiable. It can be considered what the current substitution is for regular logic programming. When only tree terms are allowed, the constraint store contains constraints in the form \`t1=t2\`; these constraints are simplified by unification, resulting in constraints of the form \`variable=term\`; such constraints are equivalent to a substitution. However, the constraint store may also contain constraints in the form \`t1!=t2\`, if the difference \`!=\` between terms is allowed. When constraints over reals or finite domains are allowed, the constraint store may also contain domain-specific constraints like \`X+2=Y/2\`, etc. The constraint store extends the concept of current substitution in two ways. First, it does not only contain the constraints derived from equating a literal with the head of a fresh variant of a clause, but also the constraints of the body of clauses. Second, it does not only contain constraints of the form \`variable=value\` but also constraints on the considered constraint language. While the result of a successful evaluation of a regular logic program is the final substitution, the result for a constraint logic program is the final constraint store, which may contain constraint of the form variable=value but in general may contain arbitrary constraints. Domain-specific constraints may come to the constraint store both from the body of a clauses and from equating a literal with a clause head: for example, if the interpreter rewrites the literal \`A(X+2)\` with a clause whose fresh variant head is \`A(Y/2)\`, the constraint \`X+2=Y/2\` is added to the constraint store. If a variable appears in a real or finite domain expression, it can only take a value in the reals or the finite domain. Such a variable cannot take a term made of a functor applied to other terms as a value. The constraint store is unsatisfiable if a variable is bound to take both a value of the specific domain and a functor applied to terms. After a constraint is added to the constraint store, some operations are performed on the constraint store. Which operations are performed depends on the considered domain and constraints. For example, unification is used for finite tree equalities, variable elimination for polynomial equations over reals, constraint propagation to enforce a form of local consistency for finite domains. These operations are aimed at making the constraint store simpler to be checked for satisfiability and solved. As a result of these operations, the addition of new constraints may change the old ones. It is essential that the interpreter is able to undo these changes when it backtracks. The simplest case method is for the interpreter to save the complete state of the store every time it makes a choice (it chooses a clause to rewrite a goal). More efficient methods for allowing the constraint store to return to a previous state exist. In particular, one may just save the changes to the constraint store made between two points of choice, including the changes made to the old constraints. This can be done by simply saving the old value of the constraints that have been modified; this method is called trailing. A more advanced method is to save the changes that have been done on the modified constraints. For example, a linear constraint is changed by modifying its coefficient: saving the difference between the old and new coefficient allows reverting a change. This second method is called semantic backtracking, because the semantics of the change is saved rather than the old version of the constraints only. Labeling The labeling literals are used on variables over finite domains to check satisfiability or partial satisfiability of the constraint store and to find a satisfying assignment. A labeling literal is of the form \`labeling([variables])\`, where the argument is a list of variables over finite domains. Whenever the interpreter evaluates such a literal, it performs a search over the domains of the variables of the list to find an assignment that satisfies all relevant constraints. Typically, this is done by a form of backtracking: variables are evaluated in order, trying all possible values for each of them, and backtracking when inconsistency is detected. The first use of the labeling literal is to actual check satisfiability or partial satisfiability of the constraint store. When the interpreter adds a constraint to the constraint store, it only enforces a form of local consistency on it. This operation may not detect inconsistency even if the constraint store is unsatisfiable. A labeling literal over a set of variables enforces a satisfiability check of the constraints over these variables. As a result, using all variables mentioned in the constraint store results in checking satisfiability of the store. The second use of the labeling literal is to actually determine an evaluation of the variables that satisfies the constraint store. Without the labeling literal, variables are assigned values only when the constraint store contains a constraint of the form \`X=value\` and when local consistency reduces the domain of a variable to a single value. A labeling literal over some variables forces these variables to be evaluated. In other words, after the labeling literal has been considered, all variables are assigned a value. Typically, constraint logic programs are written in such a way labeling literals are evaluated only after as many constraints as possible have been accumulated in the constraint store. This is because labeling literals enforce search, and search is more efficient if there are more constraints to be satisfied. A constraint satisfaction problem is typical solved by a constraint logic program having the following structure: solve(X):-constraints(X), labeling(X) constraints(X):- (all constraints of the CSP) When the interpreter evaluates the goal \`solve(args)\`, it places the body of a fresh variant of the first clause in the current goal. Since the first goal is \`constraints(X')\`, the second clause is evaluated, and this operation moves all constraints in the current goal and eventually in the constraint store. The literal \`labeling(X')\` is then evaluated, forcing a search for a solution of the constraint store. Since the constraint store contains exactly the constraints of the original constraint satisfaction problem, this operation searches for a solution of the original problem. Program reformulations A given constraint logic program may be reformulated to improve its efficiency. A first rule is that labeling literals should be placed after as much constraints on the labeled literals are accumulated in the constraint store. While in theory is equivalent to , the search that is performed when the interpreter encounters the labeling literal is on a constraint store that does not contain the constraint \`X>0\`. As a result, it may generate solutions, such as \`X=-1\`, that are later found out not to satisfy this constraint. On the other hand, in the second formulation the search is performed only when the constraint is already in the constraint store. As a result, search only returns solutions that are consistent with it, taking advantage of the fact that additional constraints reduce the search space. A second reformulation that can increase efficiency is to place constraints before literals in the body of clauses. Again, and are in principle equivalent. However, the first may require more computation. For example, if the constraint store contains the constraint \`X<-2\`, the interpreter recursively evaluates \`B(X)\` in the first case; if it succeeds, it then finds out that the constraint store is inconsistent when adding \`X>0\`. In the second case, when evaluating that clause, the interpreter first adds \`X>0\` to the constraint store and then possibly evaluates \`B(X)\`. Since the constraint store after the addition of \`X>0\` turns out to be inconsistent, the recursive evaluation of \`B(X)\` is not performed at all. A third reformulation that can increase efficiency is the addition of redundant constraints. If the programmer knows (by whatever means) that the solution of a problem satisfies a specific constraint, they can include that constraint to cause inconsistency of the constraint store as soon as possible. For example, if it is known beforehand that the evaluation of \`B(X)\` will result in a positive value for \`X\`, the programmer may add \`X>0\` before any occurrence of \`B(X)\`. As an example, \`A(X,Y):-B(X),C(X)\` will fail on the goal \`A(-2,Z)\`, but this is only found out during the evaluation of the subgoal \`B(X)\`. On the other hand, if the above clause is replaced by , the interpreter backtracks as soon as the constraint \`X>0\` is added to the constraint store, which happens before the evaluation of \`B(X)\` even starts. Constraint handling rules Constraint handling rules were initially defined as a stand-alone formalism for specifying constraint solvers, and were later embedded in logic programming. There are two kinds of constraint handling rules. The rules of the first kind specify that, under a given condition, a set of constraints is equivalent to another one. The rules of the second kind specify that, under a given condition, a set of constraints implies another one. In a constraint logic programming language supporting constraint handling rules, a programmer can use these rules to specify possible rewritings of the constraint store and possible additions of constraints to it. The following are example rules: A(X) <=> B(X)  C(X) A(X) > B(X)  C(X) The first rule tells that, if \`B(X)\` is entailed by the store, the constraint \`A(X)\` can be rewritten as \`C(X)\`. As an example, \`N*X>0\` can be rewritten as \`X>0\` if the store implies that \`N>0\`. The symbol \`<=>\` resembles equivalence in logic, and tells that the first constraint is equivalent to the latter. In practice, this implies that the first constraint can be replaced with the latter. The second rule instead specifies that the latter constraint is a consequence of the first, if the constraint in the middle is entailed by the constraint store. As a result, if \`A(X)\` is in the constraint store and \`B(X)\` is entailed by the constraint store, then \`C(X)\` can be added to the store. Differently from the case of equivalence, this is an addition and not a replacement: the new constraint is added but the old one remains. Equivalence allows for simplifying the constraint store by replacing some constraints with simpler ones; in particular, if the third constraint in an equivalence rule is \`true\`, and the second constraint is entailed, the first constraint is removed from the constraint store. Inference allows for the addition of new constraints, which may lead to proving inconsistency of the constraint store, and may generally reduce the amount of search needed to establish its satisfiability. Logic programming clauses in conjunction with constraint handling rules can be used to specify a method for establishing the satisfiability of the constraint store. Different clauses are used to implement the different choices of the method; the constraint handling rules are used for rewriting the constraint store during execution. As an example, one can implement backtracking with unit propagation this way. Let \`holds(L)\` represents a propositional clause, in which the literals in the list \`L\` are in the same order as they are evaluated. The algorithm can be implemented using clauses for the choice of assigning a literal to true or false, and constraint handling rules to specify propagation. These rules specify that \`holds([lL])\` can be removed if \`l=true\` follows from the store, and it can be rewritten as \`holds(L)\` if \`l=false\` follows from the store. Similarly, \`holds([l])\` can be replaced by \`l=true\`. In this example, the choice of value for a variable is implemented using clauses of logic programming; however, it can be encoded in constraint handling rules using an extension called disjunctive constraint handling rules or CHR‚à®. Bottom-up evaluation The standard strategy of evaluation of logic programs is top-down and depth-first: from the goal, a number of clauses are identified as being possibly able to prove the goal, and recursion over the literals of their bodies is performed. An alternative strategy is to start from the facts and use clauses to derive new facts; this strategy is called bottom-up. It is considered better than the top-down one when the aim is that of producing all consequences of a given program, rather than proving a single goal. In particular, finding all consequences of a program in the standard top-down and depth-first manner may not terminate while the bottom-up evaluation strategy terminates. The bottom-up evaluation strategy maintains the set of facts proved so far during evaluation. This set is initially empty. With each step, new facts are derived by applying a program clause to the existing facts, and are added to the set. For example, the bottom up evaluation of the following program requires two steps: A(q). B(X):-A(X). The set of consequences is initially empty. At the first step, \`A(q)\` is the only clause whose body can be proved (because it is empty), and \`A(q)\` is therefore added to the current set of consequences. At the second step, since \`A(q)\` is proved, the second clause can be used and \`B(q)\` is added to the consequences. Since no other consequence can be proved from \`{A(q),B(q)}\`, execution terminates. The advantage of the bottom-up evaluation over the top-down one is that cycles of derivations do not produce an infinite loop. This is because adding a consequence to the current set of consequences that already contains it has no effect. As an example, adding a third clause to the above program generates a cycle of derivations in the top-down evaluation: A(q). B(X):-A(X). A(X):-B(X). For example, while evaluating all answers to the goal \`A(X)\`, the top-down strategy would produce the following derivations: A(q) A(q):-B(q), B(q):-A(q), A(q) A(q):-B(q), B(q):-A(q), A(q):-B(q), B(q):-A(q), A(q) In other words, the only consequence \`A(q)\` is produced first, but then the algorithm cycles over derivations that do not produce any other answer. More generally, the top-down evaluation strategy may cycle over possible derivations, possibly when other ones exist. The bottom-up strategy does not have the same drawback, as consequences that were already derived has no effect. On the above program, the bottom-up strategy starts adding \`A(q)\` to the set of consequences; in the second step, \`B(X):-A(X)\` is used to derive \`B(q)\`; in the third step, the only facts that can be derived from the current consequences are \`A(q)\` and \`B(q)\`, which are however already in the set of consequences. As a result, the algorithm stops. In the above example, the only used facts were ground literals. In general, every clause that only contains constraints in the body is considered a fact. For example, a clause \`A(X):-X>0,X<10\` is considered a fact as well. For this extended definition of facts, some facts may be equivalent while not syntactically equal. For example, \`A(q)\` is equivalent to \`A(X):-X=q\` and both are equivalent to \`A(X):-X=Y, Y=q\`. To solve this problem, facts are translated into a normal form in which the head contains a tuple of all-different variables; two facts are then equivalent if their bodies are equivalent on the variables of the head, that is, their sets of solutions are the same when restricted to these variables. As described, the bottom-up approach has the advantage of not considering consequences that have already been derived. However, it still may derive consequences that are entailed by those already derived while not being equal to any of them. As an example, the bottom up evaluation of the following program is infinite: A(0). A(X):-X>0. A(X):-X=Y+1, A(Y). The bottom-up evaluation algorithm first derives that \`A(X)\` is true for \`X=0\` and \`X>0\`. In the second step, the first fact with the third clause allows for the derivation of \`A(1)\`. In the third step, \`A(2)\` is derived, etc. However, these facts are already entailed by the fact that \`A(X)\` is true for any nonnegative \`X\`. This drawback can be overcome by checking for entailment facts that are to be added to the current set of consequences. If the new consequence is already entailed by the set, it is not added to it. Since facts are stored as clauses, possibly with \\"local variables\\", entailment is restricted over the variables of their heads. Concurrent constraint logic programming The concurrent versions of constraint logic programming are aimed at programming concurrent processes rather than solving constraint satisfaction problems. Goals in constraint logic programming are evaluated concurrently; a concurrent process is therefore programmed as the evaluation of a goal by the interpreter. Syntactically, concurrent constraints logic programs are similar to non- concurrent programs, the only exception being that clauses includes guards, which are constraints that may block the applicability of the clause under some conditions. Semantically, concurrent constraint logic programming differs from its non-concurrent versions because a goal evaluation is intended to realize a concurrent process rather than finding a solution to a problem. Most notably, this difference affects how the interpreter behaves when more than one clause is applicable: non-concurrent constraint logic programming recursively tries all clauses; concurrent constraint logic programming chooses only one. This is the most evident effect of an intended directionality of the interpreter, which never revises a choice it has previously taken. Other effects of this are the semantical possibility of having a goal that cannot be proved while the whole evaluation does not fail, and a particular way for equating a goal and a clause head. Applications Constraint logic programming has been applied to a number of fields, such as automated scheduling,Abdennadher, Slim, and Hans Schlenker. \\"Nurse scheduling using constraint logic programming.\\" AAAI/IAAI. 1999. civil engineering, mechanical engineering, digital circuit verification, air traffic control, finance, and others.

A first basic investigation into securing the ruins was made in Soviet times. Late in the 20th century, the Uzbek government began restoration of three dome buildings and the main portal. In 1974 the government of the then-Uzbek SSR began the complex reconstruction of the mosque. The decoration of domes and facades was extensively restored and supplemented.

Their cover was formed from the juxtaposition of many small, flat brick vaults and domes supported by a forest of more than 400 marble columns and buttresses. Today, only hints of the galleries can be seen. Four minarets at the outer corners of the site have been restored. Four other, more majestic minarets that flanked the Portal arch of the entrance and the Pischtak of the main domed building are not completed yet. In the middle of the courtyard is located the stone pedestal ‚Äî the huge Quran stand ‚Äî crafted from ornate marble blocks. This remarkable sight originates from the time of Timur. The huge Bibi-Khanym Mosque with its three domed rooms, the covered galleries and the open courtyard was intended to gather the entire male population of Samarkand city for the joint Friday prayers. In the construction of three domes of Bibi-Khanym mosque, sophisticated in Timur's time, one important innovation was applied: a two-fold construction, where the internal dome hall neither by the form nor by height corresponds to the dome's shape from outside. There is a hollow space between the inner ceiling and the outer cupola. This dome construction allowed the main hall of the mosque to be committed to the proportions and the aesthetics of the 30 m high interior above the mihrab. Meanwhile, the 40 m high outer dome of the main building could be designed for maximal impression and visibility. This scheme was applied also to the lateral dome structures that allowed making modest buildings the figuration tower-like structures with elegant melon-shaped and longitudinally ribbed outer domes. The interiors of the mosque contain gilding, imitating local brocade embroideries. Bibi-Khanym mosque was one of the most ambitious architectural projects of the Timurid period and influenced the architecture of Central Asia as well as of Iran and Afghanistan.

Piezo ignition uses the principle of piezoelectricity, which, in short, is the electric charge that accumulates in some materials in response to high pressure. It consists of a small, spring- loaded hammer which, when a button is pressed, hits a crystal of PZT or quartz crystal. Quartz is piezoelectric, which means that it creates a voltage when deformed. This sudden forceful deformation produces a high voltage and subsequent electrical discharge, which ignites the gas. No external electric connection is required, though wires are sometimes used to locate the sparking location away from the crystal itself. Piezo ignition systems can be operated by either a lever, push-button or built into the control knob. An electric spark is usually generated once per turn of the knob or press of the button.

Throughout the 1990s, suggestions were put forward to have Goulburn airport as a secondary international airport to service Sydney. The Windellama Rd facility was advertised for sale in the United States, Asia Pacific as well as within Australia, it was determined in February 2011 that Goulburn Mulwaree Council sell the Airport to John Ferrara. Initially the Airport is to be leased and operated by Ferrara for up to two years. Goulburn Airport has been under consideration as a freight hub for Canberra, as the city‚Äôs international airport expands. In what is believed to be a first for an Australian airport, Goulburn airport has installed a series of hybrid wind and solar powered street light systems. Airport Facilities The primary runway is 04/22, with a paved surface measuring 1,283 m √ó 30 m (4,209 ft √ó 98 ft). 04/22 is equipped with pilot activated low intensity runway lighting. The secondary runway 08/26 measuring 676 m √ó 30 m (2,218 ft √ó 98 ft) is suitable for day operations only as it is not equipped with runway lighting and is unsealed. There is no control tower located at the airport and pilots must co- ordinate arrivals and departures using a Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (127.15), aided by an Aerodrome Frequency Response Unit (AFRU), which notifies pilots that their transmissions have been received on the frequency and activates lighting systems as appropriate. The nearest radio navigation aid for pilots is the Goulburn Non-Directional Beacon installation located within the airport boundary. Fuel is available for piston, turbine and jet powered aircraft and an automated weather service (AWIS - 136.30) also operates at the airport. Parachute Drop Zone Adrenaline Skydive received permission from the New South Wales Parachute Council to begin operation as of 5 March 2011. Adrenaline Skydive is the closest student free-fall training facility to Canberra, offering tandem skydive packages, learn to skydive courses and ongoing training, coaching and advice for all experience levels. Their skydiving drop zone is located 45 minutes from Canberra. Skydiving in Goulburn NSW, goes back over 20 years, it was a successful and popular drop zone in the 90‚Äôs attracting over 200 jumpers a weekend and had an outstanding record for safety. Adrenaline Skydive, started by Bill Tuddenham, first operated in the Newcastle / Hunter area, it was a successful tandem and student operation that attracted thousands of people from the area. John Ferarra ‚Äì Now (CEO) of Adrenaline Skydive and owner of Goulburn Airport teamed up with Tuddenham to re-open the facility. It was a work in progress for over 9 years, approval in February 2011, and operations commencing in March 2011. In August 2012, the NSW parachute council approved the appointment of Matt Chambers as chief instructor. John Ferarra (CEO), Ken Enright (General Manager) and Chambers (Chief Instructor) have a vision to promote skydiving in the Canberra and surrounding area, giving the public opportunity experience free-fall as a tandem, offering students learning to skydive.

He was the bassist for Weather Report during their final years from 1982 to 1986, and launched a solo career in 1988. As a musician, Bailey was known for his signature scat-bass solos. Biography Born in Philadelphia, on March 27, 1960, Victor Randall Bailey was raised by a highly musical family. His father, Morris Bailey Jr., was an active musician and composer, while his uncle, Donald \\"Duck\\" Bailey, was a jazz drummer, who played on numerous Blue Note records (e.g., Jimmy Smith Trio, Hampton Hawes, Carmen McRae, Dizzy Gillespie). As a child, Bailey played the drums, but ultimately switched to bass guitar after the bassist in his neighborhood band walked out of a band practice. Because young Victor took an immediate liking to the instrument, his father encouraged him to become a bass player. Beginning in 1978, at the age of 18, Bailey attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston after being disqualified from naval service due to asthma. Like his father, Bailey suffered from Charcot‚ÄìMarie‚ÄìTooth disease for most of his adult life. As the disease progressed, Bailey began using a cane to offset his weakened legs. The weakness finally spread to his upper body, necessitating his 2015 retirement from performing and from his teaching position at Berklee College of Music. He died on November 11, 2016 in Stafford, VA, likely from complications from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease). Fender released a Victor Bailey Signature acoustic bass guitar, as well as the Victor Bailey Jazz Bass (Artist series), available in 4, 5-string, fretted and fretless versions. Bailey also used Markbass amplifiers.

Ordnance Survey Map of Gisleham (19th Century)  Holy Trinity Church  The church at Gisleham, Holy Trinity, is one of 38 existing round-tower churches in Suffolk. The church has a late Anglo-Saxon or early Norman round base topped with a 15th-century octagonal brick crown. The medieval church was restored in 1861 and 1887, and the chancel in 1902 to 1908. Holy Trinity is a Grade I listed building.  Gisleham Manor  Within the civil parish of Gisleham is a moated site called Gisleham Manor. The manor dates back to the 13th-century. A house once existed that was enclosed within the moats, and is very likely to have been a fortified manor house. The house and associated buildings of the manor no longer exist. However, the outer moat survived as a buried feature of the manor. It is thought to have once been infilled. Information regarding the construction and occupation of the moated site is of great importance as it retains archaeological information from the medieval and post-medieval periods. The Manor is now a scheduled monument protected by law under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. The lordship of Gisleham Manor House was held by a number of seven families in succession. According to English Heritage: \\"The majority of moated sites served as prestigious aristocratic and seigneurial residences with the provision of a moat intended as a status symbol rather than a practical military defence.\\"  Demographics  The first national census of 1801 records a population of 198 people within the civil parish of Gisleham.

Agriculture is no longer the most popular occupation as it was in 1881, with only 10 people working in this field today. The most popular occupation currently is wholesale and retail trade; it is the occupation of 55 people. The second most popular occupation is human health and social work activities; 40 people work in this area. The most common method of transport to work is driving.

It also organises social events for LGBT humanists and public awareness initiatives around Humanism. It was founded as a separate humanist organisation, the Gay Humanist Group, later the Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association (GALHA). It became a part of the British Humanist Association in 2012, and took on the name Galha LGBT Humanists before becoming LGBT Humanists UK in 2015. The British Humanist Association became Humanists UK in 2017. For many years, its President was the poet Maureen Duffy, who became a Patron of the BHA when the organisations merged. As GALHA, the group was independently affiliated with the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) and the NGO Amnesty International. The group is led by volunteers. Past chairs include Andrew Copson, the chief executive of the BHA, who is also President of IHEU. History The Gay Humanist Group was originally founded in response to the Gay News 'blasphemy' trial by members of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality at their Brighton conference in August 1979. From its inception, the Gay Humanist Group worked to combat widespread prejudice and religious bigotry towards LGBT people in the UK, at a time when attitudes to homosexuality were still fairly negative on the whole. Since that time the organisation has played key roles in UK-wide campaigns for LGBT equality, particularly marriage rights for LGBT couples. The group had provided non-recognised humanist marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples since the 1980s, and coordinated a number of such ceremonies outside Parliament to inspire legislative action, which it credits with inspiring Mayor of London Ken Livingstone's London Partnership Register in 2001. This was in turn an inspiration for the 2005 Civil Partnership Act which preceded the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act in 2013. The Gay Humanist Group became GALHA (Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association) in 1987. It later became Galha LGBT Humanists in 2012, and then LGBT Humanists in 2015.

It is the highest mountain of Portugal, at above sea level, and is one of the highest Atlantic mountains; it is more than twice the elevation of any other peak in the Azores. History Historical eruptions of Pico have occurred from vents on its flanks rather than the summit crater. In 1562‚Äì64, an eruption on the southeast flank produced lava flows which reached the sea. Another flank eruption in 1718 also produced flows which reached the coast. The most recent eruption occurred in December 1720. On 29 September 2009 there were reports from local news sources that indicated that a fumarole existing at the pinnacle of the mountain (Piquinho) began emitting volcanic gas. The region's seismic and volcanological monitoring centre () indicated that the phenomenon occurred in the early morning, turning intense and visible in various points throughout the island and from Faial. Although the event resulted from exceptional meteorological conditions and was visible in the Central Group, there was no liberation of anomalous volcanic gases and all other parameters fell within norms. Geology View of Mount Pico from Horta, Faial Island. 29 May 2009. Mount Pico volcano is part of the Madalena Volcanic Complex, one of three volcanological units that comprise the island of Pico, associated with three historic eruptions in 1562, 1718 and 1720.Jos√© Madeira & Ant√≥nio Brum da Silveira (October 2003), p.748 Current morphology suggests an age dating to the Holocene age, confirmed by radiocarbon dates younger than 6000 years.Madeira (1998)Nunes (1999) Structurally, this complex can be subdivided into two other sections: the Pico Volcano and the East Fissural Zone. Pico is a stratovolcano (or composite), with a pit crater on its summit. Pico Alto is the round crater about 500 meters (1,600 ft) in diameter and 30 meters deep that tops the volcano, with Piquinho or Pico Pequeno (both names meaning \\"small peak\\" in Portuguese), a small volcanic cone, rising 70 metres within it to form the true summit. Meanwhile, the East Fissural Zone comprises several alignments of Hawaiian/Strombolian cinder cones and associated lava flows, which overflowed many of the cliffs, cut in older units and originated lava deltas (). The tectonic structure is characterized by two fault systems. The main WNW-ESE structures are the dextral faults of Lagoa do Capit√£o and Topo, that merge to the east, forming a narrow shallow graben (or trench). To the west, the graben is completely covered by the Pico stratovolcano occurring less than 10,000 years ago, and infilled by lava flows and cones of the Eastern Fissural zone, that includes many of the volcanic alignments and scarps. The second fault zone, running NNW-SSE, are markedly less in number and includes normal left lateral, oblique slip faults responsible for the main volcanic eruptions: the Lomba de Fogo-S√£o Jo√£o fault (basis of the 1718 eruption)and the Santo Ant√≥nio volcanic alignment. On top of Pico (at Piquinho) there is an area of permanent degasification characterized by the emission of water vapour at a temperature of between 50 ¬∞C to 75 ¬∞C. In addition, other vents also exist between and above sea level, as well as diffuse degasification along the graben between the Lagoa do Capit√£o and Topo faults. There is also a carbon dioxide-rich spring in the locality of Silveira (along the southern coast of Lajes do Pico, formed in the base of Pico. Hiking trails are available and the ascent to the summit can be made in around two to four hours from the trailhead for fit persons depending on weather which can be quite treacherous especially in winter months.

He is a native of Cidra and former head coach of Puerto Rico's basketball team. Biography Early life Mel√©ndez is the son of Florencio Mel√©ndez and Emilia Monta√±ez. He grew up alongside seven brothers and three sisters. Two of his brothers, Jorge and Diego, also had notable careers as basketball players. Mel√©ndez enjoyed sports since a young age. He moved to Cantera, a San Juan area that is close to the childhood homes of salsa singer Andy Monta√±ez and world boxing champion Ossie Ocasio, when he was still a child. At Cantera, he was enrolled at the Oratorio San Juan Bosco school, where he participated in one of Puerto Rico's best known Association football programs, the \\"Don Bosco\\" teams. He also enjoyed playing baseball. Although Mel√©ndez would have probably been chosen to play on Puerto Rico's Liga de Baloncesto Superior (Puerto Rico's professional basketball league) he decided to pursue basketball as a future career, playing in the YMCA before entering the Puerto Rico's professional basketball league in 1965, with San Juan's squad. Professional career Mel√©ndez began his coaching career in 1967, coaching a youth team. In 1968, Mel√©ndez became a member of the Puerto Rican national basketball team that competed at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City. He also represented the country in Spain, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic as a player with the national team. Mel√©ndez won four youth championships as head coach between 1967 and 1973, year in which he was traded from San Juan to the Gigantes de Carolina team in the BSN. Mel√©ndez became head coach of the Puerto Rican national women's basketball team in 1976. He helped the Gigantes reach the BSN finals in 1979, but they lost to Raymond Dalmau's Quebradillas Pirates for the championship. That year, Mel√©ndez retired as a player and decided to concentrate on his coaching career. In 1978, he stepped off as coach of the women's national team, having won two gold medals with the women's youth team and a bronze one with the veteran's team, earned at the Central American and Caribbean Games held in Medell√≠n, Colombia. Upon retiring as head coach of the female national team, Mel√©ndez made his debut as BSN head coach, with the Gigantes. He coached them into two more consecutive finals, but they again fell short to the Dalmau led Piratas de Quebradillas, in 1978 and 1979. His first year as head coach of the Gigantes, Mel√©ndez won the BSN's coach of the year award. That same year, he became head coach of the men's national team, leading them to a gold medal in the Pre-Olympics. Because United States President Jimmy Carter announced a boycott of the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, Mel√©ndez was deprived of participating in his second Olympic Games. In 1981, Mel√©ndez returned to the finals, this time coaching the Bayam√≥n Cowboys, who, helped by stars such as Rub√©n Rodr√≠guez, Jose Sosa and Roberto Valderas, won the national championship by defeating Fico Lopez, Mario Morales and the Julio Toro coached Guaynabo Mets. Mel√©ndez and Toro sustained a coaching rivalry during the early 1980s that lasted a few years. In 1982, the Cowboys lost to the Mets in the tournament's semifinals. Mel√©ndez remained as head coach of the men's national team until 1983, when he retired as head coach of that organization, having led them to a silver medal at the 1979 Pan American Games held in San Juan, and at the 1981 Centrobasket tournament as well as the 1982 Central American and Caribbean games. In 1985, Mel√©ndez led Jos√© Ortiz and the Atleticos de San German to that franchise's first championship in 30 years. He then moved to Argentina, where he was named head coach of that country's national team. He coached in Argentina's professional league, and had a stint as head coach of a professional team in Venezuela. Mel√©ndez would later on move to Panama, where he also was head coach of the national team. In 1992, Melendez earned his second BSN coach of the year award, and he repeated it in 1993. Back at the helm of the Bayam√≥n Cowboys, Mel√©ndez won his third national championship in 1995, leading the team to back to back titles when they also conquered the 1996 championship. Mel√©ndez was still coaching the Cowboys in 2004, when, as assistant coach, he finally attended his second Olympic Games, after Puerto Rico's national men's basketball team won a bronze medal at the 2003 pre-Olympic Games to qualify for the Athens sports celebration. Mel√©ndez has also coached the Ponce Lions in the BSN. He recorded his 600th career win on April 24th, 2017. As a basketball player, Mel√©ndez retired as one of only 65 players in history to reach the 5,000 points mark in the BSN, having scored 5,088 points during his career. In 2020 Mel√©ndez was managing the Indios de Mayag√ºez team until the season was postponed on account of a global pandemic. Personal life Melendez's grandson Jhivvan Jackson plays college basketball for UTSA. At the end of March 2020, Melendez was hospitalized after contracting the coronavirus during the 2020 pandemic. He recovered and tested negative by April. His wife who had also tested positive, recovered as well.

He is well-regarded in Japan for his youth films but is best known abroad for Lady Snowblood and Lady Snowblood 2: Love Song of Vengeance, films not typical of his usual style. Life and career Fujita was born in Pyongyang, Korea. After graduating from Tokyo University, he joined the Nikkatsu studio in 1955. At Nikkatsu, he worked as a publicist, screenwriter, cinematographer and assistant director until he made his debut as a director in 1967. His first film, about a juvenile delinquent, Hik≈ç sh≈çnen: Hinode no sakebi, won him the 1967 New Directors Award from the Directors Guild of Japan. After a successful sequel, Hik≈ç sh≈çnen: Wakamono no toride , Fujita was tapped by Nikkatsu to direct two installments in their youth-oriented Alleycat Rock series which had been initiated in 1970 by director Yasuharu Hasebe with Alleycat Rock: Female Boss.Weisser, pp. 40-42. Fujita's two episodes, Stray Cat Rock: Wild Jumbo and Alleycat Rock: Crazy Riders '71, both starred actress Meiko Kaji.Weisser, p. 41 Fujita's August 1971 film for Nikkatsu, Wet Sand in August, a melodramatic look at disenchanted youth in a beach setting, was both a popular hit and a major critical success.Weisser, p. 55 Three months later Nikkatsu inaugurated their Roman porno era of big budget softcore pink films.Sharp, p. 123 Fujita stayed on with Nikkatsu and his two sequels to Wet Sand in August, the 1972 Scent of Eros in AugustWeisser, p. 55-56 and the 1973 Sweet Smell of ErosWeisser, p. 424-425 were both produced as part of the Roman porno line. Fujita, however, was able to forge a compromise with the sex and nudity demands of the Roman porno genre to bring these films, especially Sweet Smell of Eros, close to mainstream acceptance. In the 1970s, Nikkatsu was still producing non-adult films as well as Roman porno and Fujita made a number of realistic dramas about youth and the generation gap including the 1973 Did the Red Bird Escape? (Akai tori nigeta) and two works from 1974, Virgin Blues and The Red Lantern, the latter film having been described as a young couple's \\"futile attempt to escape from a restrictive society.\\" The two films for which Fujita is best known outside Japan, Lady Snowblood (1973) and its sequel Lady Snowblood 2: Love Song of Vengeance (1974), were produced by an independent company during a short hiatus from Nikkatsu. These violent action movies, quite different from Fujita's usual style, reunited him with Meiko Kaji, the star of his earlier Alleycat Rock films. Fujita continued directing Roman porno films for Nikkatsu in the mid and late 1970s but the studio seldom interfered as long as the requisite nude scenes were provided and Fujita was able to produce works about relationships with a deft feel for characterization.Weisser, p. 120 He returned to his early roots in juvenile delinquent dramas with Female Delinquent: A Docu-Drama (1977) based on the autobiography of real life bad girl Mako Minato.Weisser, p. 141 His 1978 film Kaerazaru hibi told the story of a teenaged boy returning to his home town after the death of his father. In 1979 Fujita directed two films focusing on the problems of family life. So Soft, So Cunning, considered one of Fujita's best films, is \\"a somber look at family life in contemporary Japan\\",Weisser, p. 398 while Tenshi o y≈´waku is a serious portrayal of the problems faced by a young couple (Momoe Yamaguchi and Tomokazu Miura) in the suburbs. Fujita made only a few movies in the 1980s including the 1981 romantic drama Play It, Boogie-Woogie for Kadokawa Pictures. He returned to Nikkatsu for the 1983 film Double Bed about a disillusioned group of friends in their thirties and their illicit affairs. Fujita had also established himself as an actor with appearances in director Seijun Suzuki's 1980 film Zigeunerweisen and Juzo Itami's Tampopo (1985). In 1984 Fujita directed the crime thriller The Miracle of Joe Petrel and his last film as a director was Revolver, where a single gun connects the lives of several people. Fujita continued his acting career up to the time of his death in August 1997 at age 65. Awards Toshiya Fujita was nominated twice for the Award of the Japanese Academy: in 1979 for Best Director and Best Screenplay for Kaerazaru hibi and 1981 as Best Supporting Actor for Zigeunerweisen. He also won the Readers' Choice Award given by Kinema Junpo in 1979 as Best Japanese Film Director for Kaerazaru hibi.

In 1833, he married Julianna Poole. Tett ran unsuccessfully in Leeds for a seat in the legislative assembly of Upper Canada in 1838. He was again unsuccessful when he ran for the South Leeds seat in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada in 1854 but went on to represent South Leeds in the assembly from 1858 to 1863. In 1863, he was defeated by Albert Norton Richards for the same seat. Tett also served as a justice of the peace. His daughter Elizabeth married doctor Robert Henry Preston, who later represented South Leeds in the provincial assembly.

Life and career Born into a well-connected north-London Jewish family, Sylvester had trouble as a student at University College School and was thrown out of the family home. He wrote for the paper Tribune and went to Paris in 1947 where he met Alberto Giacometti, one of the strongest influences on him. Sylvester is credited with coining the term kitchen sink originally to describe a strand of post-war British painting typified by John Bratby.\\"Kitchen Sink art\\" Tate. Retrieved 16 July 2011. Sylvester used the phrase negatively but it was widely applied to other art forms including literature and theatre. During the 1950s, Sylvester worked with Henry Moore, Freud and Bacon but also supported Richard Hamilton and the other \\"Young Turks\\" of British Pop art. This led him to become a prominent media figure in the 1960s. During the 1960s and 1970s Sylvester occupied a number of roles at the Arts Council of Great Britain serving on advisory panels and on the main panel. He was also a trustee of the Tate Gallery, among a number of such positions. In 1969, he curated a Renoir exhibition at the Hayward Gallery for which he was assisted by a young Nicholas Serota.

Coupling is also the transfer of electrical energy from one circuit segment to another. For example, energy is transferred from a power source to an electrical load by means of conductive coupling, which may be either resistive or hard-wire. An AC potential may be transferred from one circuit segment to another having a DC potential by use of a capacitor. Electrical energy may be transferred from one circuit segment to another segment with different impedance by use of a transformer; this is known as impedance matching.

While best known for his sacred music, he also wrote popular secular music. Life Pujol was born in Matar√≥. In 1593 he became the assistant maestro de capilla at the cathedral in Barcelona, but he only held this post for a few months, taking the post of maestro de capilla (master of the chapel) at the cathedral in Tarragona, and then in 1595 at Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar in Zaragoza, a post which he kept for 17 years. While in Zaragoza, in 1600, he became a priest. In 1612 he returned to Barcelona, becoming maestro de capilla at the cathedral, a distinguished post which he held until his death. Most of his music dates from the time he was in Barcelona. Evidently a condition of his employment was to produce a fixed quantity of new liturgical music each year. Unusually for many composers of the time, most of it has survived. Also while in Barcelona he served as an organ consultant, and helped in various organ building projects in Catalonia. He died in Barcelona. Music Joan Pau Pujol sheet music Pujol wrote much of his music for the patron saint of Catalonia, St. George, and most of his compositions are based on Gregorian chant. He was a prolific composer, writing 13 masses, 8 settings of the Magnificat, 6 settings of the Nunc dimittis, 12 antiphons, 12 responsories, 9 complete settings of the Passion, litanies, lamentations, sequences, motets, hymns, and no less than 74 psalm settings. In addition he wrote 19 sacred villancicos, a form unique to the Iberian peninsula. Surviving secular music includes romances, letrillas, liras, novenas, tonos, a folia, and 16 other works, some of which were collected in groups of madrigals of the time; they were evidently popular in Spain in the early part of the 17th century. His missa pro defunctis--the Requiem mass--is a formal and staid setting, contrasting to the intensely emotional setting by his Spanish contemporary Tom√°s Luis de Victoria, who wrote his at almost exactly the same time. Its use of cantus firmus technique is conservative, and even archaic; most cantus firmus masses had been written more than a hundred years before. Yet many of his masses and psalm settings are polychoral, borrowing the style of the contemporary Venetian school; however the musical language is of the late Renaissance, rather than the early Baroque, which was then developing in Italy and Germany.

It is owned by the National Trust for Scotland. Context The Antonine Wall dates from about 143 AD. The ends of the wall were uncertain for many years. In the east Carriden near Bo'ness on the Forth was a likely endpoint. In the west is Old Kilpatrick on the Clyde, although there were also forts beyond that at Bishopton and Barochan Hill. The fort is one of the best- preserved of the forts constructed along the Wall. Built against the southern rear face of the Wall, the fort was defended by 6 metre thick turf ramparts and surrounded by defensive ditches. Gateways were provided through the main Wall to the north, and also through the walls on the other three sides of the fort. Causeways were then constructed across the main Antonine and secondary defensive ditches, affording easy access to and from the fort. The fort was the second smallest on the Wall and had an area of about 4,000 square metres. The fort contained several buildings, made of stone from a time when this was a less common construction material. The traces of the commander's house, the barracks, the headquarters, the bath house and a granary have been discovered. Although the original buildings have not survived, these buildings' foundations were discovered during excavations in 1902-03, 1932 and 1957-61. A video reconstruction of the site has been produced. Finds Inscriptions found on recovered artifacts indicate that the fort based 480 men of the Cohors VI Nerviorum of Nervii, foot soldiers drawn from a north-eastern Gallic tribe. The military road on the south side of the Wall, which enabled transport between all forts, is still well defined and there is also a fine length of rampart and ditch still intact to the west. An altar to Victory was found in 1843 to the south of the fort. Other finds include a bangle, some glass from a window and leather shoes. A feature of the defences at the fort, discovered during the excavations, is a series of pits lying to the north west of the causeway across the Antonine ditch. These pits, known as lilia, would originally have contained sharpened stakes at the bottom. The lilia were positioned to help defend the vulnerable northern gateway through the Wall. Near the fort were a turf platform (beacon platform or signalling platform) and gravel pits for building of the military road. Interestingly the bath house was built on an annexe. The fort was defended by Nervii and Flavius Betto was a commanding officer. file:Romanwallinscotl00macduoft raw 0329 II.pngRIB 2144.

Oxygene based on Delphi's Object Pascal, but also has influences from C#, Eiffel, Java, F# and other languages. Compared to the now deprecated Delphi.NET, Oxygene does not emphasize total backward compatibility, but is designed to be a \\"reinvention\\" of the language, be a good citizen on the managed development platforms, and leverage all the features and technologies provided by the .NET and Java runtimes. Oxygene is a commercial product, and offers full integration into Microsoft's Visual Studio IDE on Windows, as well as its own IDE, Fire for use on macOS. The command line compiler is available free. Oxygene is one of four languages supported by the underlying Elements Compiler toolchain, next to C#, Swift and Java). From 2008 to 2012, RemObjects Software licensed its compiler and IDE technology to Embarcadero to be used in their Embarcadero Prism product. Starting in the Fall of 2011, Oxygene became available in two separate editions, with the second edition adding support for the Java and Android runtimes. Starting with the release of XE4, Embarcadero Prism is no longer part of the RAD Studio SKU. Numerous support and upgrade paths for Prism customers exist to migrate to Oxygene. As of 2016, there is only one edition of Oxygene, which allows development on Windows or macOS, and which can create executables for Windows, Linux, WebAssembly .NET, iOS, Android, Java and macOS.  The language  The Oxygene language has its origins in Object Pascal in general and Delphi in particular, but was designed to reflect the guidelines of .NET programming and to create fully CLR-compliant assemblies. Therefore, some minor language features known from Object Pascal / Delphi have been dropped or revised, while a slew of new and more modern features, such as Generics or Sequences and Queries have been added to the language. Oxygene is an object-oriented language, which means it uses classes, which can hold data and execute code, to design programs. Classes are \\"prototypes\\" for objects, like the idea of an apple is the prototype for the apple one can actually buy in a shop. It is known that an apple has a colour, and that it can be peeled: those are the data and executable \\"code\\" for the apple class. Oxygene provides language- level support for some features of parallel programming. The goal is to use all cores or processors of a computer to improve performance. To reach this goal, tasks have to be distributed among several threads. The .NET Framework's \`ThreadPool\` class offered a way to efficiently work with several threads. The Task Parallel Library (TPL) was introduced in .NET 4.0 to provide more features for parallel programming. Operators can be overloaded in Oxygene using the \`class operator\` syntax: class operator implicit(i : Integer) : MyClass; Note, that for operator overloading each operator has a name, that has to be used in the operator overloading syntax, because for example \\"+\\" would not be a valid method name in Oxygene.  Program structure  Oxygene does not use \\"Units\\" like Delphi does, but uses .NET namespaces to organize and group types. A namespace can span multiple files (and assemblies), but one file can only contain types of one namespace. This namespace is defined at the very top of the file: namespace ConsoleApplication1; Oxygene files are separated into an interface and an implementation section, which is the structure known from Delphi. The interface section follows the declaration of the namespace. It contains the \`uses\` clause, which in Oxygene imports types from other namespaces: uses System.Linq; Imported namespaces have to be in the project itself or in referenced assemblies. Unlike in C#, in Oxygene alias names cannot be defined for namespaces, only for single type names (see below). Following the \`uses\` clause a file contains type declarations, like they are known from Delphi: interface type ConsoleApp = class public class method Main; end; As in C#, the Main method is the entry point for every program. It can have a parameter \`args : Array of String\` for passing command line arguments to the program. More types can be declared without repeating the \`type\` keyword. The implementation of the declared methods is placed in the implementation section: implementation class method ConsoleApp.Main; begin // add your own code here Console.WriteLine('Hello World.'); end; end. Files are always ended with \`end.\`  Types  As a .NET language, Oxygene uses the .NET type system: There are value types (like structs) and reference types (like arrays or classes). Although it does not introduce own \\"pre- defined\\" types, Oxygene offers more \\"pascalish\\" generic names for some of them, so that for example the \`System.Int32\` can be used as \`Integer\` and \`Boolean\` (\`System.Boolean\`), \`Char\` (\`System.Char\`), \`Real\` (\`System.Double\`) join the family of pascal-typenames, too. The struct character of these types, which is part of .NET, is fully preserved. As in all .NET languages types in Oxygene have a visibility. In Oxygene the default visibility is \`assembly\`, which is equivalent to the \`internal\` visibility in C#. The other possible type visibility is \`public\`. type MyClass = public class end; The visibility can be set for every type defined (classes, interfaces, records, ...). An alias name can be defined for types, which can be used locally or in other Oxygene assemblies. type IntList = public List; //visible in other Oxygene- assemblies SecretEnumerable = IEnumerable; //not visible in other assemblies Public type aliases won't be visible for other languages. = Records = Records are what .NET structs are called in Oxygene. They are declared just like classes, but with the \`record\` keyword: type MyRecord = record method Foo; end; As they're just .NET structs, records can have fields, methods and properties, but do not have inheritance and cannot implement interfaces.  Interfaces  Interfaces are a very important concept in the .NET world, the framework itself makes heavy use of them. Interfaces are the specification of a small set of methods, properties and events a class has to implement when implementing the interface. For example, the interface \`IEnumerable\` specifies the \`GetEnumerator\` method which is used to iterate over sequences. Interfaces are declared just like classes: type MyInterface = public interface method MakeItSo : IEnumerable; property Bar : String read write; end; Please notice, that for properties the getter and setter are not explicitly specified.  Delegates  Delegates define signatures for methods, so that these methods can be passed in parameters (e.g. callbacks) or stored in variables, etc. They're the type-safe NET equivalent to function pointers. They're also used in events. When assigning a method to a delegate, one has to use the \`@\` operator, so the compiler knows, that one doesn't want to call the method but just assign it. Oxygene can create anonymous delegates; for example methods can be passed to the \`Invoke\` method of a control without declaring the delegate: method MainForm.MainForm_Load(sender: System.Object; e: System.EventArgs); begin Invoke(@DoSomething); end; An anonymous delegate with the signature of the method \`DoSomething\` will be created by the compiler. Oxygene supports polymorphic delegates, which means, that delegates which have parameters of descending types are assignment compatible. Assume two classes \`MyClass\` and \`MyClassEx = class(MyClass)\`, then in the following code \`BlubbEx\` is assignment compatible to \`Blubb\`. type delegate Blubb(sender : Object; m : MyClass); delegate BlubbEx(sender : Object; mx : MyClassEx); Fields can be used to delegate the implementation of an interface, if the type they're of implements this interface: Implementor = public class(IMyInterface) // ... implement interface ... end; MyClass = public class(IMyInterface) fSomeImplementor : Implementor; public implements IMyInterface; //takes care of implementing the interface end; In this example the compiler will create public methods and properties in \`MyClass\`, which call the methods / properties of \`fSomeImplementor\`, to implement the members of IMyInterface. This can be used to provide mixin-like functionality.  Anonymous methods  Anonymous methods are implemented inside other methods. They are not accessible outside of the method unless stored inside a delegate field. Anonymous methods can use the local variables of the method they're implemented in and the fields of the class they belong to. Anonymous methods are especially useful when working with code that is supposed to be executed in a GUI thread, which is done in .NET by passing a method do the \`Invoke\` method (\`Control.Invoke\` in WinForms, \`Dispatcher.Invoke\` in WPF): method Window1.PredictNearFuture; //declared as async in the interface begin // ... Calculate result here, store in variable \\"theFuture\\" Dispatcher.Invoke(DispatcherPriority.ApplicationIdle, method; begin theFutureTextBox.Text := theFuture; end); end; Anonymous methods can have parameters, too: method Window1.PredictNearFuture; //declared as async in the interface begin // ... Calculate result here, store in variable \\"theFuture\\" Dispatcher.Invoke(DispatcherPriority.ApplicationIdle, method(aFuture : String); begin theFutureTextBox.Text := aFuture ; end, theFuture); end; Both source codes use anonymous delegates.  Property notification  Property notification is used mainly for data binding, when the GUI has to know when the value of a property changes. The .NET framework provides the interfaces \`INotifyPropertyChanged\` and \`INotifyPropertyChanging\` (in .NET 3.5) for this purpose. These interfaces define events which have to be fired when a property is changed / was changed. Oxygene provides the \`notify\` modifier, which can be used on properties. If this modifier is used, the compiler will add the interfaces to the class, implement them and create code to raise the events when the property changes / was changed. property Foo : String read fFoo write SetFoo; notify; property Bar : String; notify 'Blubb'; //will notify that property \\"Blubb\\" was changed instead of \\"Bar\\" The modifier can be used on properties which have a setter method. The code to raise the events will then be added to this method during compile time.

Since Oxygene doesn't compile per-file but per-project, it does not depend on the name of the file. Instead the unit or namespace keyword is used to denote the default namespace that all types are defined in for that file * procedure and function: method is the preferred keyword, though procedure and function still work. * overload: In Oxygene all methods are overloaded by default, so no special keyword is needed for this * .Create(): This constructor call has been replaced by the new keyword. It can still be enabled in the project options for legacy reasons * string: Characters in strings are zero-based and read-only. Strings can have nil values, so testing against empty string is not always sufficient.  Criticism  Some people would like to port their Win32 Delphi code to Oxygene without making major changes. This is not possible because while Oxygene looks like Delphi, there are enough changes so as to make it incompatible for a simple recompile. While the name gives it the appearance of another version of Delphi, that is not completely true. On top of the language difference, the Visual Component Library framework is not available in Oxygene. This makes porting even more difficult because classic Delphi code relies heavily on the VCL.

Biography Early life Kunigunde was born in Wiener Neustadt, the fourth of five children to Emperor Frederick III and his wife Eleanor, daughter of King Edward of Portugal. However, only she and her elder brother Maximilian survived to adulthood. She was raised in Wiener Neustadt and at the Inner Austrian court in Graz, Styria, where she grew up in an informal and open atmosphere, without rigid court etiquette. Contrary to former practice, she learned not only to read, write, and embroider, but also received instruction in riding and hunting, astronomy and mathematics.Sigrid- Maria Gr√∂√üing: Um Krone und Liebe. Amalthea Verlag. Kunigunde's family had left the Imperial residence at the Hofburg in Vienna after lengthy quarrels with Frederick's younger brother Archduke Albert VI of Austria. Though Albert had unexpectedly died in 1463 and the emperor proclaimed a general Landfrieden peace, armed hostilities in the Austrian lands continued. Like most daughters of royal families, since her early years Kunigunde was involved in the political intrigues of her time. In 1470 the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus requested her hand; however, Emperor Frederick, a rival for the Crown of Saint Stephen and also for the Lands of the Bohemian Crown, refused him. As her mother had died in 1467, Kunigunde made her formal presentation at the side of her father at the age of fifteen, in 1480, during the visit of Duke George of Bavaria, called \\"the Rich\\", to Frederick's court in Vienna. George was solemnly enfeoffed with the Imperial estate of Bavaria-Landshut and after the celebrations Kunigunde was sent to Burggraf Ulrich III von Graben to Graz for her safety; however, after a plot against the emperor was discovered, he moved to Linz and sent Kunigunde to the Tyrolean court in Innsbruck with Archduke Sigismund of Austria, Frederick's first cousin and former guardian. Duchess of Bavaria-Munich Statue in the Hofkirche, Innsbruck. In Innsbruck Kunigunde met Duke George's cousin, Albert IV, then ruler of Bavaria-Munich and about 18 years her senior, whom she married on 2 January 1487. Her father had initially given his consent, however, when Albert's forces occupied the Imperial City of Regensburg, he changed his mind. The couple wed at the Innsbruck Hofburg residence, against the will of Kunigunde's father. Her brother Maximilian mediated between her and Emperor Frederick; he was able to prevent an imperial ban. Kunigunde followed her husband to Bavaria and served as joint regent for their eldest son William IV, born in 1493. In spite of her resignation from the Imperial court, she tried to influence the politics of the state as she acted in favour of the rights of her younger sons. She stayed in close contact with her brother, Emperor Maximilian I, and with other rulers and relatives in Europe. After the death of Albert in 1508 she later joined the Convent of P√ºttrich which she favoured and lived there until her death in 1520.

He represented Grey South in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1867 to 1874 and Grey East from 1875 to 1884. Biography Lauder was born at Bewcastle in England in 1834, studied in Scotland and later came to Canada West. He taught school for a while, then moved to Toronto, articled in law and was called to the bar in 1864. In 1856, he and writer Maria Elise Turner Lauder were married. They had one child, the pianist William Waugh Lauder. In 1871, it was found that one of Lauder's supporters had used bribery to obtain votes. Lauder himself was not implicated, but was unseated as a result and then was reelected in the by-election that followed. Lauder later proved that a government land valuator, John L. Lewis had influenced voters in Proton by promising benefits from a Liberal government; also implicated were Archibald McKellar, Adam Oliver and James Kirkpatrick Kerr, the law partner of Ontario Premier Edward Blake. In 1872, Lauder defended the strike committee of the Toronto Typographical Union against charges brought forward by the Master Printers' Association; Canadian law at the time was not clear on the status of labour organizations. In 1881, Lauder Township was named in his honor. He died in Toronto in 1884.

Verne wrote the first draft in 1901.William Butcher, Jules Verne: The Definitive Biography, Thunder's Mouth Press, 2006, p. 292. . It was first published posthumously in 1905. The plot of the novel involves piracy in the South Atlantic during the mid-19th century, with a theme of survival in extreme circumstances, and events centering on an isolated lighthouse. Verne was inspired by the real lighthouse at the Isla de los Estados, Argentina, near Tierra del Fuego and Cape Horn. The novel was adapted into the 1971 movie, The Light at the Edge of the World.  Plot summary  1898 photo of the actual Lighthouse San Juan del Salvamento Verne sets the plot by stating, \\"The Argentine Republic had displayed a happy initiative in constructing this lighthouse at the end of the world,\\" within Elgor Bay and the harbor of Saint- Jean \\"forms a kind of pendant to Elgor Bay.\\" The despatch boat Sante-F√© arrived on Oct. 1858 to construct the lighthouse, which was inaugurated on 9 Dec. 1859, standing 103 feet in height on top of a mound 120 feet high, and illuminated by oil. The lighthouse guided ships into the Le Maire Strait or south of the island, and was to be manned by 3 keepers over the next 3 months, until the return of the Santa F√©. Unbeknownst to Vasquez, Moriz, and Felipe, the chief lighthouse keeper and his helpers, the island was the domain of a dozen marooned pirates, who bide their time in wrecking. Two of them are murdered by a band of newly arrived pirates led by one Kongre. Vasquez, the only survivor, spends several months until the dispatch boat Sante Fe is due to return, surviving off the pirates' hidden stores of food in a cave. After the Century, an American ship from Mobile, Alabama, crashes on the island due to the light's having been put out by the pirates, Vasquez bands with the sole survivor of the wreck ‚Äî First Officer John Davis ‚Äì to stop the pirates from escaping into the South Pacific. They manage to scavenge a cannon from the wreckage and shoot the pirates' ship, the Maule, as it is about to leave the bay they are situated in. The shell only causes minor damage, however, and the pirates' carpenter is able to fix it in only a few days. The night before the ship is about to attempt to leave again, Vasquez swims to the Maule at its mooring and plants a bomb in the rudder. This causes, yet again, only minor damage, and is fixed in only one day. The next day however, Carcante, the second-in-command of the pirate ship, spots the Sante Fe on the horizon. Fortunately for the pirates, it will not arrive until nighttime, and the Sante Fe can't possibly get into the bay without light from the lighthouse. This will give the pirates the perfect chance to slip out and sail around the southern side of the island, which they know quite well by now. Vasquez and Davis, however, return to the lighthouse and turn the light back on. The troop of pirates tries to regain the lighthouse and kill the two, but they find the bolted iron door to the staircase too reinforced to break down. Kongre, the band's leader, orders Carcante and the carpenter to climb the side of the lighthouse and murder Vasquez and Davis at the top, but they are shot as soon as their heads peek over the banister. Kongre and the remaining pirates realize it is all over for them and flee to the island's interior. Most surrender afterward, a few starve, and Vasquez watches as Kongre commits suicide. Vasquez returns home with the Sante Fe after making sure the island is safe for the new lighthousemen.

History Previously working for Eric Burdon, Binks was a drummer on the 1974 Roger Glover album The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast. The album project began as a soundtrack for an animated film based on a well-known English children's book, but a promo for the film never gained any interest, so the project was scrapped. Glover went on to release the soundtrack as a \\"Roger Glover and Friends\\" title. One of the featured vocalists, Eddie Hardin, later released his own albums, the first of which was 1976's Eddie Hardin's Wizard's Convention, which again included Binks on drums. Binks played for the band Fancy who had two U.S. hits in 1974 with a cover of \\"Wild Thing\\", and \\"Touch Me\\". Through his connection to Roger Glover who had just wrapped up production of their Sin After Sin album, Binks joined the up-and-coming heavy metal act Judas Priest in March 1977 for their world tour ‚Äî their first on American soil. Binks remained with the band for two and a half years, until July 1979, recording the studio albums Stained Class and Killing Machine and the live album Unleashed in the East. While with Judas Priest, he received a writing credit for the song \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\" from the Stained Class album. Binks made a home demo of the track with friend Steve Mann of the Michael Schenker Group helping on guitar, and at a band rehearsal he picked up a guitar to show them the song. The band loved the song and vocalist Rob Halford then crafted the song's lyrics and title. Binks left the band just prior to the start of the North American leg of the \\"Killing Machine\\" (Hell Bent for Leather) tour. Binks said in 2017 that he left because he felt he was essentially hired as a \\"freelance session drummer\\" by the band and was never made an official member. He felt insulted when the band's then-manager Mike Dolan suggested that he \\"waive his fees\\" (i.e. not get paid for his performance) on the live Unleashed in the East album, a RIAA-certified platinum seller. In 1979, Binks joined Charlie Whitney and Axis Point and remained active in the British hard rock/heavy metal underground. In 1981, he was a member of Lionheart which featured Dennis Stratton (ex-Iron Maiden) on guitar and Jess Cox (ex-Tygers Of Pan Tang) on vocals, though this was only a brief stint. Also in 1981, Binks played on the album Finardi by Italian rock singer Eugenio Finardi. Binks toured with Lionheart (1981) and Tytan (1982‚Äì1983) soon after their first single release. Since then, Binks has appeared in a classic rock cover band around South London called The Shakers, with Dave Bunce, guitarist Pete Friesen (formerly with Jeff Beck and with Alice Cooper), and vocalist/guitarist Tom Lundy (of The Poor Mouth). Rounding out the band was bassist Phil Rynhart, co-founder member of The Poor Mouth. Binks and Pete Friesen have also done time in Metalworks, along with ex-Iron Maiden guitarist Tony Parsons, playing covers of Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and other legendary metal bands around London. In 2013, he joined the band Raw Glory, which also featured singer Paul Manzi (of Arena). In 2015, Binks played live around London in Broken Bones with ex-Bad II The Bone members Ed Hudson and Paul Smith, and in original prog-folk-rock band Kindred Spirit with whom he recorded the album Phoenix Rising . During 2017 and 2018, he performed classic Judas Priest songs live with a new band called Les Binks' Priesthood.

They recorded a session in 2001 which was aired on BBC Radio 1's Evening Session, and were subsequently invited to perform a Peel session at Maida Vale. By this point, McColl had left the band as work commitments forced a move to New York and then London, however he played on two of the four tracks recorded at Maida Vale. Bass guitar on the remaining tracks was played by Chris Bathgate, formerly touring guitarist for Ganger, and latterly live bassist for Arab Strap and now frontman for Edinburgh outfit Sans Trauma. Soon after this Peel Session, Chris Bathgate took on guitar and additional vocal duties and Tom Nicol was recruited on bass to help the duo of Branagh and Smith. Shortly thereafter, Bathgate departed and the band welcomed Bob Fairfoull, formerly of Idlewild on bass guitar.

Reform of the Court of Session had been proposed as early as 1805 by the Whig government trying to impose a system based on that of England, especially the use of a civil jury trial. That particular government fell before their reform bill was enacted. In 1808, reform was pushed through by a Tory government. The Court was split into two divisions. Judgments of the new divisions could only be appealed to the House of Lords at the leave of the division, or in the case of a dispute between its judges. Decrees of the Lords Ordinary could only be appealed to the House of Lords after being reviews by the Divisional judges. The Act also established a commission to review the processes of the Court of Session, including the possibility of the introduction of jury trial and the creation of permanent Lords Ordinary. The Commissioner's review led to two further Acts, the Court of Session Act 1810 and the Court of Session Act 1813.

On August 21, 1995, the flight was operated using an Embraer EMB 120RT Brasilia (registration number N256AS), a twin-turboprop commuter airliner. The aircraft made its first flight in 1989 and was delivered to Atlantic Southeast Airlines on March 3 of that same year. Before the fatal flight, it had made 18,171 cycles (one cycle can be roughly defined as one flight)Definition of \\"cycles\\" Aviation-terms.com and accumulated a total of 17,151.3 flight hours. The aircraft was equipped with a cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and a flight data recorder (FDR). The captain of the flight was Edwin \\"Ed\\" Gannaway, age 45, and the first officer was Matthew \\"Matt\\" Warmerdam, age 28. Gannaway was a skilled pilot with 9,876 total hours of flying experience, including 7,374 flight hours in the Embraer Brasilia.

The airplane was unable to stay in the air long enough and the pilots began searching for an open space to make an emergency landing. At 12:52:45 the airplane struck the tops of the trees and crashed into a field in Carroll County, Georgia near the farming community of Burwell and the city of Carrollton. Casualties All of the passengers and crew aboard Flight 529 survived the initial impact; the fatalities were the result of a post-crash fire. The fire started approximately one minute after impact and an oxygen bottle behind the First Officer's seat leaked, contributing to the strength of the fire. Despite a dislocated shoulder, First Officer Warmerdam used the cockpit fire axe to cut through the thick cockpit glass. A surviving passenger later assisted by pulling the axe out of the cockpit through the hole Warmerdam had created and struck the glass from the outside in order to increase the size of the hole and help Warmerdam escape. While he was being rescued, Warmerdam said to fire chief, \\"Tell my wife, Amy, that I love her.\\" the fire chief replied, \\"No sir, you tell her that you love her, because I'm getting you out of here.\\" The emergency crews successfully pulled Warmerdam out of the aircraft, but Captain Gannaway was knocked unconscious in the crash landing and never regained consciousness, eventually succumbing to the fire. In an ambulance, Warmerdam consoled a paramedic who believed Warmerdam would soon die. The paramedic had undressed him to cool him down and pinned his badge to his underwear, to help with identification later. Despite his injuries, Warmerdam survived the plane crash. In addition to Captain Gannaway, seven passengers died as a result of the crash and subsequent fire, including three who died within thirty days of the crash, bringing the official death toll to eight.Harrison, Eric. \\"Crash of commuter plane kills three and injures 26\\" (Archive).

None of the passengers or crew escaped uninjured; eight had minor injuries. Among the seriously injured were First Officer Warmerdam and flight attendant Fech. Many of the passengers suffered survivor guilt; some believed that they should have assisted other passengers.\\"Wings\\" Newsletter, Issue 7 Fall 2002 , Wings of Light One of the survivors died of a heart attack eight weeks after the crash. She was included in a dedication to the people killed by the crash in a memorial service at an elementary school gymnasium some years later. Probable cause The probable cause of the accident was determined to be the failure of the propeller due to undiscovered metal fatigue in one blade resulting from corrosion from chlorine. There had been two previous failures of the same type of propeller, but those aircraft had been able to land safely. The failed propeller blade had undergone scheduled ultrasonic testing on May 19, 1994, which resulted in its rejection and removal from the propeller. The blade was sent to a Hamilton Standard facility, where it was subject to refurbishing work that was incorrectly performed. The propeller blade was then installed on the propeller fitted to the aircraft on September 30, 1994. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) criticized Hamilton Standard, who had maintained the propellers, for \\"inadequate and ineffective corporate inspection and repair techniques, training, documentation and communication\\", and both Hamilton and the Federal Aviation Administration for \\"failure to require recurrent on-wing ultrasonic inspections for the affected propellers\\". The overcast skies and low cloud ceiling at the crash site also contributed to the severity of the crash. Aftermath The Military Fraternal Organization of Pilots awarded Warmerdam its medallion for his role in the disaster after treatment for burns. In 2002, after an estimated 50 surgeries and lengthy therapy, he was able to resume flying for ASA. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons honored his positive attitude during the long recovery with one of their ‚ÄúPatients of Courage: Triumph Over Adversity‚Äù awards in 2005.\\"Back in the sky\\" (Archive), TheCitizen.com, Fayette Publishing Inc. The area residents built a memorial to the crash at the Shiloh United Methodist Church, near Burwell. Many surviving passengers credited Robin Fech, the flight attendant, with saving their lives. Tanner Medical Center treated Fech's broken wrist and other lacerations before releasing her. The Georgia State Senate passed a resolution honoring Fech. The NTSB accident report commended \\"the exemplary manner in which the flight attendant briefed the passengers and handled the emergency.\\" However, one passenger (who was also the daughter of passenger that died of a heart attack following the crash), cried futilely out to Fech, who was with other passengers in the hayfield, to help her and her mother. The passenger initially criticized Fech; later she reasoned that Fech could not hear her screams and/or did not see her through the thick smoke. In addition, Fech was proven to have been assisting passengers at that moment. Fech stated that the passenger's criticism upset her. Fech never worked as a flight attendant again after the ASA 529 disaster. In popular culture * The events of Flight 529 were featured in \\"A Wounded Bird\\", a Season 2 (2004) episode of the Canadian TV series Mayday (called Air Emergency and Air Disasters in the U.S. and Air Crash Investigation in the UK and elsewhere around the world). The dramatization was broadcast in the United States with the title \\"One Wing Flight\\". The accident was also included in a Mayday Season 6 (2007) Science of Disaster special titled \\"Fatal Flaw\\", which was called \\"Fatal Fix\\" in the United Kingdom, Australia and Asia. * A book on the disaster, Nine Minutes, Twenty Seconds: The Tragedy & Triumph of ASA Flight 529 by Gary M.

Reflectivity of ridged atomic mirrors right Various estimates for the efficiency of quantum reflection of waves from ridged mirror were discussed in the literature. All the estimates explicitly use the de Broglie theory about wave properties of reflected atoms. Scaling of the van der Waals force The ridges enhance the quantum reflection from the surface, reducing the effective constant ~C~ of the van der Waals attraction of atoms to the surface. Such interpretation leads to the estimate of the reflectivity : \\\\displaystyle r \\\\approx r_0\\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\frac \\\\ell L C,\\\\\\\\!~K\\\\sin(\\\\theta)\\\\right), where ~\\\\ell~ is width of the ridges, ~L~ is distance between ridges, \\\\displaystyle ~\\\\theta~ is grazing angle, and ~K=mV/\\\\hbar~ is wavenumber and ~r_0(C,k)~ is coefficient of reflection of atoms with wavenumber ~k~ from a flat surface at the normal incidence. Such estimate predicts the enhancement of the reflectivity at the increase of period ~L~; this estimate is valid at KL\\\\\\\\!~\\\\theta^2\\\\ll 1. See quantum reflection for the approximation (fit) of the function ~r_0~. Interpretation as Zeno effect For narrow ridges with large period L, the ridges just blocks the part of the wavefront. Then, it can be interpreted in terms of the Fresnel diffraction of the de Broglie wave, or the Zeno effect; such interpretation leads to the estimate the reflectivity :~\\\\displaystyle r \\\\approx \\\\exp\\\\\\\\!\\\\left(-\\\\sqrt{8\\\\\\\\!~K\\\\\\\\!~L}~\\\\theta\\\\right)~, where the grazing angle \\\\displaystyle ~\\\\theta~ is supposed to be small. This estimate predicts enhancement of the reflectivity at the reduction of period ~L~. This estimate requires that ~\\\\ell/L \\\\ll 1~. Fundamental limit For efficient ridged mirrors, both estimates above should predict high reflectivity. This implies reduction of both, width, \\\\ell of the ridges and the period, L. The width of the ridges cannot be smaller than the size of an atom; this sets the limit of performance of the ridged mirrors. Applications of ridged mirrors Ridged mirrors are not yet commercialized, although certain achievements can be mentioned. The reflectivity of a ridged atomic mirror can be orders of magnitude better than that of a flat surface. The use of a ridged mirror as an atomic hologram has been demonstrated. In Shimizu's and Fujita's work, atom holography is achieved via electrodes implanted into SiN4 film over an atomic mirror, or maybe as the atomic mirror itself. Ridged mirrors can also reflect visible light; however, for light waves, the performance is not better than that of a flat surface. An ellipsoidal ridged mirror is proposed as the focusing element for an atomic optical system with submicrometre resolution (atomic nanoscope).

It is a non-destructive technique (will not damage the evidence in question), allowing further tests to be carried out. It is a sensitive technique capable of detecting indentations on pages several layers below the top sheet and many years after the indentations were created. EDD equipment and investigative techniques were central to overturning a number of convictions in the United Kingdom, as it was possible to demonstrate that witness statements had been altered or signed as blank pages in reverse order to the main notes. This was central in a number of cases investigated at the West Midlands Serious Crime Squad that were appealed. The allegations of tampering with evidence and witness statements led to the unit being disbanded, and over 60 convictions being quashed, many of the appeals relying on EDD evidence. See West Midlands Serious Crime Squad for full details of the cases How it works When writing is fashioned on a sheet of paper resting upon other pages, the indentations or impressions produced are transferred to those below. These transferred impressions can be detected using an EDD. In some situations, a questioned document such as a ransom note, or an extortion letter, may exist which can be determined to be the source of indentations detected on another piece of paper (e.g., an offender's notepad). Alternatively, indentations detected on a business contract might match information present on another such document. In some situations this would be an entirely innocent finding; however, if the two businesses are supposed to be operating independent of one another, then the finding could be significant.The sourcing/matching of indentations must be interpreted in the context of the investigative scenario. That is, indentations and source writing that 'match' indicate only that pieces of paper were in physical juxtaposition at the time the writing occurred. Decipherable indentations may also provide valuable information even when a second document is not present or cannot be located. For example, an anonymous letter may bear impressions of writing that relate to some mundane activity of the offender which could ultimately lead an investigator to a particular suspect. The electro-physical basis whereby an EDD actually works is complex. The original theory suggested that the paper sandwiched between the grounded platen and the mylar charging film acted as a type of capacitor with the change in capacitance being due to differing compression of the paper. This led to models like the 'Thickness Variation Theory' and the 'Surface Variation Theory'. However, it turns out that a detectable 'indentation' is not due to the physical pressure applied to the writing instrument as one might expect. Rather, Seward in 1998 and 1999 proposed an alternative theory explaining the detection capability of an EDD as being due to a surface charge effect created by paper-to-paper friction specifically in the area where a writing instrument is pressed down into the top-most sheet of paper. Seward's model was based upon \\"charge transport through the Mylar- paper-platen structure\\" and is appropriately called the 'charge transport model'. Subsequent testing , demonstrated that the charge transport model, while not perfect, is sound. This testing also clarified that areas of indentation are less negatively charged than surrounding areas. It is this relative difference in potential that causes the toner to be attracted to the areas of indentation, rather than other areas on the mylar surface. Seward's model also helps to explain two unusual phenomena sometimes observed when using an EDD: # 'pure' indentations caused by impact printing, for example, may not produce good EDD results # indirect secondary 'impressions' may appear that are caused by lateral relative motion between two sheets of paper when the source sheet bears significant embossing. Additionally, indentations can sometimes not develop very well even though they are clearly visible. This may occur, for example, with very heavy or deep impressions or with impressions in glossy heavy-weight paper such as that used for brochures. In such situations, it is possible to use digital scanning and image-processing to document such writing impressions. Practical use Despite the complexity of the underlying theoretical mechanism, the practical use of an EDD is straightforward. Most devices are similar in their operation. The following are the key steps in using an EDD to visualize indentations:ASTM Standard E 2291 ‚Äì 03, 2003, \\"Standard Guide for Indentation Examinations,\\" ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA, 2003, www.astm.org. * Evaluation of material :# Assess adequacy of material for examination: an EDD works best when used on a single sheet of clean, smooth paper (that is, paper without wrinkles, creases or stains). The presence of any of these factors may preclude effective examination or, at the minimum, mean that the results will be limited.Foster + Freeman ESDA-2 User Manual 14-06, July 2008 (UK/US) Heavy- weight, coated or treated papers often produce poor results. The purported age of the document is not generally a factor of concern. Latent indentations have been developed on documents older than fifty years. :# Examination using side (oblique) lighting: as a general rule, all items should be examined using side lighting. This is important because visual examination may detect deep indentations even though the EDD may fail to develop those indentations properly. :# Documents that have been subjected to high levels of humidity will not generally retain indentations. As a result, other forensic examinations involving the wetting of a document, such as fingerprint development using a ninhydrin solution, should not be done until after examination for indentations. * Preparation :# Humidification: an EDD works best when the relative humidity is less than 60%. Some studies have also suggested that absolute humidity is important. To help ensure proper humidification, most manufacturers provide a 'humidification chamber' that can be used to prepare a document for examination. It is important to note that over-humidification is also possible so care must be taken to not actually wet the document.The Foster + Freeman ESDA2 user manual states \\"Over- humidification may have the same effect as wetting the document with a liquid. The ESDA image may be degraded or obliterated.\\" :# Fitness-for-use (FFU) test; AKA, control sample: since an EDD may fail to detect indentations when they are actually present (for a variety of reasons), it is important to check on the equipment's performance using a control sample (commonly called a FFU test) known to have indentations. Recommendations include using a FFU test sample at the beginning and end of a series involving the examination of multiple questioned documents, or placing a small FFU test sample adjacent to each questioned document on the platen. The FFU test can be prepared by hand using a similar writing instrument and similar paper. Alternatively, a special device call the 'Gradient¬Æ' can be used to produce control indentations that vary in depth in a known manner thereby permitting the examiner to determine not only that the EDD is working but also the degree to which it is sensitive. It is not essential to precisely match the questioned document in terms of paper type or pen type since the objective is to show that the device is functioning properly. * Placement on platen: the goal is to place the questioned document flat on the platen surface with few wrinkles or distortions (ideally, none). The document should not extend beyond the platen edges and enough room should be present around the document to allow the charging filmSome manufacturers refer to this as an \\"imaging film\\" (see below) to seal against the platen surface. :# Type of document: as noted above, an EDD works well with a single sheet of paper up to a legal-sized sheet.The platen size varies by device. As an example, the platen on the Foster + Freeman ESDA is approximately 24cm x 42 cm However, if there are concerns about biological or chemical contamination, due to the condition of the questioned document, it is possible to use a second sheet of clean paper, e.g. copier paper, known to be free of indentations as a barrier between the platen and questioned document. Books and other multipage items can also be examined in some instances but these require additional preparation. Ideally, individual pages should be removed from such items but this is not always possible. As an alternative, a sheet of conductive material (e.g., aluminum foil) can be used to contact the conductive surface. :# Covering with charging film: As noted above, the charging film should cover the document completely and contact the platen all the way around the document. The charging film serves two purposes: it protects the document from subsequent toner application and it takes the electrostatic charge required to 'develop' any latent indentations on the document. The film should be laid over the document taking care to avoid wrinkles or excessive stretching of the film. Most EDD devices have a roll of bulk film positioned adjacent to the device for ease in application. The charging film will adhere to the platen due to suction applied through the surface of the platen.Many systems use a sintered brass plate for the platen but any porous and conductive surface would, in theory, work for this purpose * Charging of surface: the top surface of the charging film must be electrostatically charged. To achieve this most EDDs use a shielded (grounded) hand-held unit containing a high-tension corona wireA single strand of wire through which a high voltage (-8 kV) electrical charge is passed similar to a corona wire used in some electrophotographic devices. Some manufacturers refer to this as a 'corona wand'. which is turned on and literally waved over the entire surface of platen for several seconds criss- crossing the platen area. The objective is to produce an evenly distributed electrostatic charge in the air above the surface of the charging film. After passing the unit over the platen, the examiner waits for a few minutes until the charge has been passed to the surface of the charging film. * Application of toner to develop indentations. The EDD is able to visualize indentations because the surface is differentially charged depending upon whether or not an indentation is present. The negatively charged toner particles are attracted to areas where there are indentations in the paper surface. Once an electrostatic charge has been applied to the charging film, the latent indentations can be developed. This is done using a powder toner very much like toner found in any electrophotographic printing device. There are various methods used for this purpose. ** Cascade method: Some EDDs have a platen that is hinged on one edge to permit it to be tilted. A mixture of toner and small carrier beads (made of glass or similar non-conductive materialThe carrier material and toner composition is carefully designed based upon their triboelectric properties to ensure proper deposition.) is then poured over the surface of the document from one side to the other. The beads, and excess toner, are captured on the lower edge of the device to be reused.Some manufacturers have built in a 'catch tray' for this purpose. This process can be repeated several times in order to develop all areas of the document. ** Aerosol spray method: Some EDDs provide the ability to spray toner over the surface of the charging film. In these systems a protective shell or chamber is fitted that covers the entire platen. At one end there is a nozzle connected to a reservoir of toner. The examiner then manually activates a pump that sprays toner into the chamber creating a cloud of fine toner that settles down onto the surface of the charging film. Ideally the cloud is randomly distributed but often this method produces a relatively distinctive pattern of toner on the film. ** Brush method: With some EDDs the toner is applied using a magnetic brush such as would be used for development of latent fingerprints. This is a manual process that is quite tedious and requires meticulous control of the brush. But the method works well for selective development of subtle indentations. ** Toner pad method: Similar to the brush method described above but uses a special pad with a built-in toner reservoir.Some manufacturers refer to this as a toner application device, or TAD. The toner pad is placed on the surface of the charging film and moved across the surface by hand. * Assessment of results. After the development process is complete the examiner must assess the results of the test process. ** FFU test results: since the questioned document may or may not have indentations, the correct method to assess the functionality of the EDD is through inspection of the FFU test sample. :**If indentations are developed from the FFU test sample, the EDD can be considered as functioning correctly. :**If no indentations developed from the FFU test sample, the EDD is not working. :**If the FFU test was positive and no indentations are developed in the area of the questioned document, then the assessment will be that no detectable indentations have been developed. It is important to note that this does not mean the questioned document was never in contact with other items of interest. The absence of detectable indentations may be due to one or more limitations causing the indentations to not be detected. :**Note that the presence of indentations in the document area is prima facie evidence that detectable indentations exist such that the FFU test is redundant. * Preservation of results. It is important to record and/or preserve the results of a test, especially if the test is positive (i.e., indentations were developed). This can be done in at least two ways. ** Adhesive lift: in this method, a sheet of fixing film is used to preserve the developed indentations. The fixing film is usually a relatively rigid sheet of self-adhesive, transparent polymer film. It is applied by removing the backing material and carefully laying the fixing film directly onto the charging film, thus trapping and fixing the toner in place between the films. Pressure is then carefully applied to the top of the fixing film by hand or with a small roller. The resulting sandwich is referred to simply as a \\"lift\\", or EDD lift. Interpretation of the developed indentations is generally done using the lift after removal from the document because this permits the examiner to see the developed indentations on their own without interference from any visible markings on the document. ** Photography/scanning: the results may also be captured using a camera, either directly from the charging film or from the lift after removal from the document. Scanning is also an option but only when using the lift itself. Aside from visualizing indentations, the method can be used to detect the presence of fresh fingerprints, fiber disturbance on the paper surface (e.g. relating to mechanical erasure of information), or the presence of footwear impressions on paper.

History Schema of Einthoven galvanometer, with quartz filament marked a-a'- 1903 Previous to the string galvanometer, scientists were using a machine called the capillary electrometer to measure the heart‚Äôs electrical activity, but this device was unable to produce results of a diagnostic level.'Einthoven's String GalvanometerThe First Electrocardiograph', Moises Rivera-Ruiz et al, Tex Heart Inst J. ¬© 2008 by the Texas Heart Institute Willem Einthoven adapted the string galvanometer at Leiden University in the early 20th century, publishing the first registration of its use to record an electrocardiogram in a Festschrift book in 1902. The first human electrocardiogram was recorded in 1887; however, it was not until 1901 that a quantifiable result was obtained from the string galvanometer. In 1908, the physicians Arthur MacNalty, M.D. Oxon, and Thomas Lewis teamed to become the first of their profession to apply electrocardiography in medical diagnosis. Mechanics Einthoven's galvanometer consisted of a silver-coated quartz filament of a few centimeters (see picture on the right) and negligible mass that conducted the electrical currents from the heart. This filament was acted upon by powerful electromagnets positioned either side of it, which caused sideways displacement of the filament in proportion to the current carried due to the electromagnetic field. The movement in the filament was heavily magnified and projected through a thin slot onto a moving photographic plate.'Willem Einthoven and the Birth of Clinical Electrocardiography a Hundred Years Ago', S. Serge Barold, Cardiac Electrophysiology Review, Springer Netherlands January 2003 Einthoven (1901) The filament was originally made by drawing out a filament of glass from a crucible of molten glass. To produce a sufficiently thin and long filament an arrow was shot across the room so that it dragged the filament from the molten glass. The filament so produced was then coated with silver to provide the conductive pathway for the current.A History of Electrocardiography pg 112-113 By tightening or loosening the filament it is possible to very accurately regulate the sensitivity of the galvanometer. The original machine required water cooling for the powerful electromagnets, required 5 operatorsNIH and weighed some 600 lb. Procedure Patients are seated with both arms and left leg in separate buckets of saline solution. These buckets act as electrodes to conduct the current from the skin's surface to the filament. The three points of electrode contact on these limbs produces what is known as Einthoven's triangle, a principle still used in modern-day ECG recording.

It is the oldest newspaper in the country and is owned by The Standard Group, which also runs the Kenya Television Network (KTN), Radio Maisha, The Nairobian (a weekly tabloid), KTN News and Standard Digital which is its online platform. The Standard Group is headquartered on Mombasa Road, Nairobi, having moved from its previous premises at the I&M; Bank Tower. History The newspaper was established as the African Standard in 1902 as a weekly by Alibhai Mulla Jeevanjee, an immigrant businessman from British India. In 1905 Jeevanjee sold the paper to Maia Anderson and Rudolf Franz Mayer, who changed the name to the East African Standard. It became a daily paper and moved its headquarters from Mombasa to Nairobi in 1910. At the time the newspaper declared strongly colonialist viewpoints. The British-based Lonrho Group bought the newspaper in 1963, only a few months before Kenya's independence. The paper changed its name to The Standard in 1977 but the name East African Standard was revived later. It was sold to Kenyan investors in 1995. In 2004 the name was changed back to The Standard. It is the main rival to Kenya's largest newspaper, the Daily Nation. In 1989, at a time when Kenya was going into multi-party era, the Standard Group acquired the KTN Television Channel. It is the oldest newspaper published in Kenya. The top editors at the Standard Group include Kipkoech Tanui (The Standard, Daily Editions) and John Bundotich (Weekend Editions) with Charles Otieno editing The Nairobian. The head of Radio Maisha is Tom Japanni, KTN Managing Editor is Ellen Wanjiru, while Standard Digital Managing Editor is Carole Kimutai. Premises raid, 2006 In late February 2006 The Standard ran a story claiming that president Mwai Kibaki and senior opposition figure Kalonzo Musyoka had been holding secret meetings. At 1:00 am local time (2200 UTC), on 2 March, masked gunmen carrying AK-47s raided the editorial office of The Standard, and of its television station KTN. They kicked and beat staff members, forcibly took computers and transmission equipment, burned all the copies of the 2 March edition of the newspaper, and damaged the presses. At KTN, they shut down its flow of electricity, putting the station off the air. Initially, the Kenyan information minister claimed no knowledge of the raid, but has since revealed that Kenyan police were responsible, and stated that the incident was to safeguard state security. \\"If you rattle a snake you must be prepared to be bitten by it,\\" John Michuki said. Three journalists at The Standard, arrested after the critical story was printed, were released on 2 March on bail of 50,000 Kenyan shillings (US$692).

Introduction In marketing, there are different approaches to the introduction of a (new) product into the market. Marketers always try to create a segmentation of the market in order to focus their product offering. Segmentation can be done on demographic, behavioral, or other bases. According to this segmentation, different options of differentiation vis-√†-vis the competition get evaluated and implemented. This is called positioning of the product. McCarthy‚Äôs 4 marketing P‚Äôs, product, placement, promotion, and pricing are repeatedly used to create good combination of product features at the right price, distributed via preferred distribution channels, and combined with an appealing promotion. One aspect tends to be forgotten: purchase timing behaviour or simply, timing aspect. Time marketing researches and gives guidelines on when to position a product in the market. Not only competition, but also absolute time frames in a consumer‚Äôs life are considered. Examples An obvious example, known for years before any research was conducted on this matter, illustrates the importance of timing aspects in marketing. A fan is a typical example of a product that goes on sale according to laws of nature and therefore timing. In summer, department stores have promotions on fans, as higher temperatures urge consumers to purchase. Research has found that products are bought by customers at different moments of the day and different days of the week. Approximately 80% of diaries are sold in the month of November. However, 75% of the diaries not sold in November (15% of the total market) are sold on a Monday.

There is one cardinal in Bangladesh, Patrick D'Rozario, the country's first ever cardinal. The Catholic Bishops' Conference of Bangladesh, founded in 1971, is the General Body of the Ordinaries of Bangladesh. The purpose of this Conference is to facilitate common policy and action in matters that affect or are liable to affect the interest of the Catholic Church in Bangladesh and to be of service to the country at large. Pope John Paul II visited Dhaka in November 1986. The U.S. State Department and human rights groups have cited Bangladesh as a nation of concern with regards to violence against religious minorities, including Hindus and Christians. A notable incident of violence against Christians was a 2001 bomb attack on a Catholic church during Sunday Mass, killing nine and maiming dozens. Since the rise of al-Qaida and ISIS, violence, threats and various forms of oppression against non-Muslims have increased in Bangladesh, and a 2014 State Department report noted insufficient government efforts to protect religious minorities. In January 2014, homes were set ablaze and eight Catholics were injured, allegedly for exercising their right to vote in the nation's parliamentary elections. In July 2014, a mob of 60 stormed a Catholic convent, where they proceeded to beat up nuns and a priest. In April 2015, a mob attacked churchgoers and stabbed a priest during Easter Mass. In December 2015, three adult siblings in a Catholic family were attacked while inside their home. Two of them were injured critically. In early February 2016, a group of 20 raided a church and a convent at night. Nuns were beaten and property was looted. In July 2016, nearly two dozen people were killed by gunman during an attack on a popular restaurant in Dhaka where Christians and other non-Muslims, mostly foreigners, were known to frequent. In 1598, the first priest arrived in Bangladesh accompanying the Portuguese. Pope Francis visited Bangladesh in November 2017.

The genesis of the Indian Humanist Union lay in an earlier society called the Society for Promotion of Freedom of Thought (SPFT) established in 1954 at Allahabad (India) by Narsingh Narain, a former teacher, civil servant and concurrent philosophy scholar. Later, when he learnt of the International Humanist & Ethical Union, as a sequel to the \\"Amsterdam Declaration\\" (1952), he changed the nomenclature of SPFT to \\"The Humanist Union\\" which he founded in 1960 at Nainital with the primary objective of the diffusion of knowledge concerning moral and social problems considered from the Humanist point of view, which, briefly according to IHU, stood for two basic values - love for fellow beings coupled with the scientific spirit of free enquiry. IHU is affiliated to the Humanist International (formerly known as International Humanist and Ethical Union IHEU). The official symbol of the IHU is a version of the Happy Human. The first Chairman of the IHU was P N Sapru, former High Court Judge and Member of Indian Parliament. Narsing Narain who was working as the first General Secretary of the Union succeeded PN Sapru as the Chairman of IHU. In 1966, Indian Humanist Union commenced the publication of a Quarterly Journal The Humanist Outlook devoted to the furthering of the scientific attitude, ethical values, social reform and communal harmony. In 1970 at the joint initiative of Narsingh Narain and Abe Soloman, a distinguished humanist & Life Member of IHU the Humanist Endowment Fund Society was set up by some members of the IHU to provide financial stability to the humanist movement in India. On his death in 1972 Narsingh Narain bequeathed all his life's savings to this Society. The Corpus of HEFS has continued to grow steadily though slowly, mainly through further donations by dedicated members. After the death of Narsingh Narain, Shyam Kumari Khan, a noted social worker, General Secretary of the Indian Council for Child Welfare, Member of the Indian Parliament and a Founder Member of the IHU was elected as the new Chairperson. ShyamKumari was succeeded by Sajid Hussain a former Member of the U.P. Legislative Assembly and Life Member of IHU. Sajid Hussain was succeeded by Prakash Narain, a Founder Member of IHU with a brilliant academic record and a rich experience in the United Nations and the Government of India which included working as Chairman of the Railway Board and Principal Secretary to the Govt. of India and also as Secretary to Govt. of India in several other Ministries. IHU is devoted primarily to the furtherance of human values and the building of a more humane society through an ethics based on human perceptions and capabilities without linking it with any supra-human entity, that is, on assessments made in a spirit of reason and free enquiry. Its endeavours are oriented towards bringing about attitudinal changes amongst humanists and others through diverse means like bringing out a quarterly journal and other publications, development of humanist music cassettes, staging of street plays, holding of periodical discussions, Symposia and Seminars as well as collaborative network linked voluntary social work. The annual Narsingh Narain Memorial Seminars specially receive wide coverage in the national and international media which helps in spreading humanist values into a wider spectrum of society. The IHU also participates actively in the International humanist movement in regard to organizational and conceptual matters.  References  *Narsingh Narain (ed. A.

He was an employee at the British Government's Ministry of Defence (MoD) from 1991 to 1994. Mr. Pope had a wide range of duties for the MOD relating to non-operational RAF activities. Non-operational activities are those (e.g., public relations) that are not directly related to preparing for or executing warfare. One of his responsibilities was to investigate UFO phenomena to determine if they had any defense significance. He moved to the United States in January 2012. Ministry of Defence Pope worked in the Ministry of Defence from 1991 to 1994 in a section of Secretariat (Air Staff) known as Sec (AS) 2a, where his duties included investigating reports of UFO sightings, to see if they had any defence significance. At the time, while the Ministry of Defence stated that it \\"remains totally open-minded about the existence or otherwise of extraterrestrial lifeforms\\", it also stated that there was no evidence to suggest that any UFO sightings posed any threat to the UK or that they were extraterrestrial in origin. It is clear from material that Pope wrote whilst still at the MoD that he did not share the MoD's view that conventional explanations could be found for all UFO sightings. Pope's final posting in the MoD was to the Directorate of Defence Security. In 2009 MoD announced that UFO sightings would no longer be investigated. Media work In November 2006, Mr. Pope stated that the government's \\"X-Files have been closed down\\". He continues his research and investigation in a private capacity and now works as a freelance journalist and media commentator, covering subjects that include the unexplained, conspiracy theories, space, science fiction and fringe science. He does work for a number of film companies and PR agencies, promoting the release of science fiction films. On 24 June 2013 he appeared on IGN's comedy show Up at Noon promoting the game The Bureau: XCOM Declassified. In 2015, he appeared in multiple episodes of UFOs Declassified, airing on Canada's History Television, the UK's Yesterday, and Smithsonian Channel in the US. Books Open Skies, Closed Minds is Pope's autobiographical account of his interest in ufology. It provides an overview of the UFO phenomenon, with the emphasis on Pope's three-year tour of duty at the Ministry of Defence where his responsibilities included investigating UFO sightings and any impact they might have on UK national defense. Pope also discusses the politics surrounding the way in which those within government and the military view UFO-phenomena. In 1997 he released a second book on similar themes entitled The Uninvited. His book Encounter in Rendlesham Forest: The Inside Story of the World's Best-Documented UFO Incident, written with John Burroughs, USAF, Ret., and Jim Penniston, USAF, Ret., was published by Thomas Dunne Books in April 2014. Pope has also written two science fiction novels, Operation Thunder Child and its sequel Operation Lightning Strike. Journalism Pope also writes for online alternative news site Neonnettle in which he talks about current topics and news as well as UFO based material on the site fortnightly column.

While still entrenching the political power of the White section of the South African population (or, more specifically, that of the National Party, NP), it did give a limited political voice to the country's Coloured and Indian population groups. The majority Black population group was still however excluded. History The Tricameral Parliament can trace its origin back to 1981, when the Senate was replaced with the President's Council (), which was an advisory body consisting of sixty nominated members from the White, Coloured, Indian, and Chinese population groups. Following a request by Prime Minister P.W. Botha, the President's Council presented a set of proposals in 1982 for constitutional and political reform. This proposal called for the implementation of \\"power sharing\\" between the White, Coloured, and Indian communities. The right wing of the NP was very unhappy about this proposal, and a group of its MPs, led by Dr. Andries Treurnicht, a cabinet minister and the leader of the NP in the Transvaal province, broke away to form the Conservative Party (CP) to fight for a return to apartheid in its original form. However, Botha continued to be in favour of implementing the President's Council proposal, and, in 1983, the NP government introduced a new constitutional framework. Referendum To approve the proposed constitution, a referendum among White voters was held on 2 November 1983. Both the Progressive Federal Party (PFP), which objected to the exclusion of Blacks, as well as the CP, which objected to the participation of Coloureds and Indians, campaigned for a \\"No\\" vote. The conservative opposition to the reforms used banners with the text \\"Rhodesia voted yes ‚Äì vote no!\\", reflecting on the transformation to majority rule in Rhodesia.Whose Kith and Kin Now?, Peter Godwin, Sunday Times, 25 March 1984 However, many PFP followers and parts of the anti-government English-language press supported the new constitution as \\"a step in the right direction\\". Consequently, the \\"Yes\\" vote won the referendum with 66.3% of the ballots cast. The proposed constitution was consequently enacted by parliament as the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act of 1983. Opposition The general election for the House of Representatives and House of Delegates in August 1984 ran into heavy opposition. The United Democratic Front (UDF) was formed by a number of (mainly pro-African National Congress) community organisations and trade unions to oppose and boycott these elections. Nevertheless, although the election boycott was widely supported, the new constitution did come into effect, and the general election was held. The Indian and Coloured chambers of the Tricameral Parliament suffered from a crisis of credibility, with election boycotts leading to notoriously low turnouts (the 1984 elections achieved only a 16.2% turnout).Elections in South Africa African Elections Database Elected officials in these houses were sometimes scorned for participating in the apartheid system. In 1987, Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, the leader of the opposition in the White chamber, quit parliamentary politics, as he saw it as increasingly irrelevant to South Africa's political future. Structure Chambers The parliament had three separately elected chambers: *A 178-member (White) House of Assembly (), which was in effect the existing single-chamber Parliament. *An 85-member (Coloured) House of Representatives () *A 45-member (Indian) House of Delegates (). Under the original proposals, the White chamber was to be known as the \\"Assembly\\", while the Indian chamber was to be known as the \\"Chamber of Deputies\\".South Africa and the Consociational Option: A Constitutional Analysis, Laurence Boulle, Juta, 1984, page 152 The Senate was abolished with effect from 1981.Africa: Official Yearbook of the Republic of South Africa, Department of Information, 1979, page 952 Each of these three chambers had power over the \\"own affairs\\" (as it was termed) of the population group it represented, such as education, social welfare, housing, local government, arts, culture and recreation. \\"General affairs\\", such as defence, finance, foreign policy, justice, law and order, transport, commerce and industry, manpower, internal affairs, and agriculture required approval from all three chambers, after consideration by joint standing committees. Leadership The government was led by a State President. The office of Prime Minister was abolished, and its powers were de facto transferred to the State President, which was made an executive post with very broad executive powers. He was to be selected from among the members of the Tricameral Parliament by an 88-member electoral college composed of 50 Whites, 25 Coloureds and 13 Indians, each group chosen by its respective house in parliament, and held office for the parliament's duration‚Äîin practice, five years. The State President appointed a Cabinet of ministers who would be in charge of \\"general affairs\\" as well as Ministers' Councils for each of the three parliamentary chambers to manage their \\"own affairs\\". Cases of disagreements between the three houses of Parliament on specific legislation would be resolved by the President's Council. It consisted of 60 members‚Äî20 members appointed by the House of Assembly, 10 by the House of Representatives, five by the House of Delegates and 25 directly by the State President. Although ostensibly based on population figures, the numerical composition of the electoral college and the President's Council meant that the white chamber could not be outvoted by the other two chambers. Thus, the real power remained in white hands‚Äîand in practice, in the hands of Botha's National Party, which had a large majority in the white chamber. For all intents and purposes, Botha held nearly all governing power in the nation. The constitution made no provision for the representation of Black South Africans. Botha's government stripped blacks of their South African citizenship and legally considered them citizens of the homelands, in which they were expected to exercise their political rights. Location The House of Assembly met in the Assembly chamber at the Houses of Parliament in Cape Town. The House of Representatives met in the former Senate chamber. The House of Delegates met in a new building across the road from the Houses of Parliament which also housed a chamber for joint sittings of the three houses of the Tricameral Parliament. Race Relations Survey, South African Institute of Race Relations, page 130 Currently (2020) the National Assembly meets in the chamber built for joint sittings of the former Tricameral Parliament while the National Council of Provinces is housed in the old Senate chamber. The decor of the National Assembly chamber still retains the theme incorporating wooden panels of tessellating sets of three triangles. Dissolution In 1994, ten years after the Tricameral Parliament was formed, one of the last pieces of legislation it passed was the Interim Constitution of 1993, which paved the way for the first non-racial elections that were held on 27 April of that year.

Beginning in 1971, Antoon directed numerous plays at the New York Shakespeare Festival over a period of nearly 20 years. In 1973, Antoon became one of the few directors to have been nominated for two Tony Awards in the same category in the same year. In addition to winning the Tony Award with one of his nominations, Antoon was also the winner of a Drama Desk Award, a New York Drama Critics' Circle Award, and an Obie Award. His career lasted until 1991; he died less than a year later from AIDS-related lymphoma.  Biography  Alfred Joseph Antoon was born in Methuen, Massachusetts, on December 7, 1944. His parents were Alfred J. Antoon, Sr. and Josephine Antoon (n√©e Saba). Antoon attended Lawrence Central Catholic High School in nearby Lawrence, Massachusetts. After high school he studied for priesthood at the Shadowbrook Jesuit seminary in Lenox, Massachusetts, while also attending Boston College. He later dropped out from the seminary and earned his Bachelor's Degree from Boston College in 1968. He went on to attend the Yale School of Drama for a year and a half before leaving to begin his work in professional theatre. Antoon died at the age of 47 from AIDS-related lymphoma on January 22, 1992, at the NYU Medical Center. After his death, a collection of Antoon's papers and correspondence was donated to Billy Rose Theatre Collection. Career Antoon directed his first professional production, Story Theatre, at St. Clement's Church Theatre in 1971. In that same year, Antoon presented Subject to Fits, a play written by his Yale friend Robert Montgomery, to Joseph Papp, founder of the New York Shakespeare Festival. Papp gave Antoon the directing job, and the play opened on February 14, 1971, at the Public Theater. This was the first of many productions he would direct for the New York Shakespeare Festival over a career lasting 20 years. Subject to Fits was successful, and it moved to London where it was staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company at The Place. Antoon continued his success with the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1971 with his direction of Tale of Cymbeline. In 1972, Antoon directed both the off-Broadway and Broadway debut productions of That Championship Season as well as a Broadway production of Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing. Antoon was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play for both productions and won with That Championship Season. Since then, no director was nominated for two Tony awards in the same category until Matthew Warchus in 2009. That Championship Season also won the 1972 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Director and the 1972 New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for Best Play. Antoon's production of Much Ado About Nothing was also successful; he directed a television adaptation of it in 1973. Following his success with these two productions, Antoon was awarded an honorary doctorate from his alma mater, Boston College. Antoon went on to direct numerous original Broadway productions, including The Good Doctor, The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in- the-Moon Marigolds, and Sherlock's Last Case. In 1975, Antoon directed a production of Trelawny of the 'Wells' featuring the Broadway debuts of Meryl Streep and Mandy Patinkin. In 1979, Antoon directed a production of The Art of Dining for which he won an Obie Award for Best Direction. In 1984, Antoon directed a production of The Rink with Liza Minnelli for which he was nominated for a Drama Desk Award. Antoon's last production with the New York Shakespeare Festival was a 1990 Wild West-themed production of The Taming of the Shrew in Central Park. His final production came shortly thereafter with Song of Singapore in 1991. References  External links  * A. J.

Noted for audience participation films, it was named for Valhalla, the \\"Hall of the slain\\" in Norse mythology. History The cinema opened its doors on 10 June 1976 at 216 Victoria Street, Richmond. The first film to be screened there was Michael Ritchie's \\"Smile\\". The cinema was started by two friends from Sydney University ‚Äì Barry Peak and Chris (Christopher) Kiely. They had been running short seasons of films by the likes of the Marx Brothers, W.C. Fields & Mae West and Humphrey Bogart in Melbourne for some time. Realising that they needed a permanent home in Melbourne, rather than keep renting venues such as the Palais in St Kilda and the Horticultural Hall in Victoria Street, Melbourne, they leased the cinema at 216 Victoria Street, Richmond. Although it initially had no seats, and patrons had to bring their own, it soon found a following. Among its more distinctive traits were its calendars, which contained up to six months' worth of upcoming attractions, and its request board, where anyone could add a request for any film with a reasonable expectation of its being screened. Later, it became the home of two long-running audience participation films, \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" (from 1978) and \\"The Blues Brothers\\" (from 1980), as well as regular 24-hour film marathons. The marathons were often science fiction themed, showing anything from Hollywood blockbusters like \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\", B-grade films such as \\"Them!\\" or the complete series of Star Trek motion pictures. Animation celebrations were a popular with audiences. The cinema also ran regular weekend, or week-long, festivals on a theme: Jacques Tati, New Russian Cinema, Fassbinder, Herzog, Pink Panther, Bond Films, Astaire/Rogers, Woody Allen, Mel Brooks, Kurosawa. Shows like these ‚Äì and the general selections played there ‚Äì quickly led to the Valhalla becoming firmly associated in the public mind with cult films. At its peak audiences included 400 patrons and 30 dedicated performers. From the late 1970s Valhalla expanded both within Melbourne and around Australia. It opened: The Academy Valhalla Twin Cinema in Melbourne on the corner of Swanston and Collins Streets, Valhalla at the Agora at La Trobe University, late shows at The Astor in St Kilda and then at The National in St Kilda as well as cinemas in Adelaide, Perth and Brisbane. In 1987, the Valhalla relocated from Richmond to High Street, Westgarth after the sale of their original venue (it was later demolished). With the characteristic offbeat nature of the cinema, the last film screened at the old premises was the first half of \\"The Blues Brothers\\", with the second half being screened at the new venue after intermission. This caused a traffic jam in Richmond at 1 am. The Valhalla closed its doors in 1996 and became the Westgarth Cinema, after the rental costs of their Northcote site became too high to meet. The owners of the Westgarth cinema building continued to run it, as \\"The Westgarth\\", until early 2006. At that point the cinema business was sold to the Palace Films and Cinemas chain, whilst they retain the ownership of the building. The building recently reopened after extensive renovations and the addition of two more screens. It now screens more traditionally arthouse fare. Ironically, both the expanded number of screens and the films screened have brought it closer to what the Valhalla had always wanted to do with the venue.  Other Valhallas  Glebe in Sydney was also home to a cinema called the Valhalla, which was very similar to the Melbourne version ‚Äì they produced a calendar of screenings, for example. The Valhalla in Sydney opened in 1979 when Chris Kiely (one of the original Melbourne Valhalla partners) leased the 1937 Art Deco Astor Cinema. It closed in August 2005.http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/25662 In March 2013, the \\"Valhalla Social Cinema\\" began operating in Melbourne. Celebrating the memory of Valhalla's 24 hour marathons, it is operated by Jose Maturana. The portable community cinema does not reside in a permanent location, instead appearing in spaces that are not traditionally associated with movie halls. It specialises in 12 and 24-hour marathons, but also partakes in festival sideshows.  Valhalla People  The original team of people who ran the Val went on to help run a number of the other independent cinemas in Melbourne. The Nova Cinema in Carlton is partly owned by Barry Peak. In the 1980s Barry Peak and Chris Kiely wrote, produced and directed four feature films: Future Schlock, Channel Chaos, The Big Hurt and As Time Goes By. Some of the managers of various Valhalla Cinemas include Ray Pond, Sue Thompson, Jane Kendrik and Peter Castaldi.

In 1901 it was used by him to win the Deutsch de la Meurthe prize for a flight from Parc Saint Cloud to the Eiffel Tower and back within thirty minutes. Background In April 1900 Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe offered the Deutsch de la Meurthe prize, also simply known as the \\"Deutsch prize\\", of 100,000 francs to the first machine capable of flying from the A√©ro-Club de France's flying field at Parc Saint Cloud to the Eiffel Tower in Paris and back in less than thirty minutes. The winner of the prize needed to maintain an average ground speed of at least to cover the round trip distance of in the allotted time. The prize was to be available from May 1, 1900 to November 1, 1901. To win the prize, Alberto Santos-Dumont decided to build dirigible No. 5, a larger craft than his earlier designs. On August 8, 1901 during one of his attempts, the airship began to lose gas, causing the envelope to lose shape and making it necessary to shut down the engine, which also powered the ventilator which inflated the internal ballonet. It started to descend and was unable to clear the roof of the Trocadero Hotel. Santos-Dumont was left hanging in a basket from the side of the hotel. With the help of firemen he escaped without injury, but the airship was a write-off, only the engine being salvaged. Design After the wreck of No.5 Santos Dumont immediately started work on a replacement, which was finished by September 1. Similar to the No.5 but slightly larger, it had an envelope of varnished silk from which an elongated uncovered gondola was suspended by steel wires. The envelope was fitted with a single manoeuvering valve and two automatic pressure-relief valves: in addition there were two ripping panels to enable hydrogen to be rapidly vented in an emergency. The triangular section gondola was constructed of lengths of pine connected with aluminium sockets and braced with piano wire. The 12 hp (9 kW) engine was mounted in the centre of the gondola and drove a two-bladed pusher propeller at the rear via a long driveshaft. The pilot stood in a small balloon basket at the front. The triangular rudder was carried between the rear of the gondola and the envelope. Operational history Often published as a photo of Santos-Dumont during the prize-winning flight, this is actually an earlier attempt using No.5 After some tethered trials on September 5 Santos Dumont made his first flight in the airship on September 6. After an hour and a half of trials at the Longchamps racecourse he flew the craft to meet friends at a nearby restaurant, but on attempting to return to his base at Chalais-Meudon a series of mishaps ended with the gondola being damaged. However it was soon repaired and a first attempt at the Deutsch de la Meurth prize was made on September 19, ending when the airship was blown against some trees during preliminary trials, resulting in the envelope being punctured. Another more successful flight was made on October 10, followed by an attempt on the prize the following day, which was frustrated by technical problems. Another successful trial flight followed on the 13th. Further flying was ruled out by the weather until October 19, when Santos-Dumont took off from Saint-Cloud at 2:42 pm. With the wind behind him, he reached the Eiffel Tower in nine minutes, but on the return journey but then suffered an engine failure. To restart the engine, he had to climb back over the gondola rail without a safety harness. The attempt was successful, and he reached the finish line after 29 minutes 30 seconds. However, there was a short delay before his mooring line was secured, and at first the adjudicating committee refused him the prize, despite de la Meurthe, who was present, declaring himself satisfied. This caused a public outcry from the crowds watching the flight, as well as comment in the press. However a face-saving compromise was reached, and Santos-Dumont was awarded the prize. In a charitable gesture, he gave half the prize to his technicians and donated the other half to the poor of Paris. After winning the De la Meurthe prize Santos-Dumont took the airship to Monte Carlo in January 1902, making use of the newly built balloon shed belonging to the Prince of Monaco on the Boulevard de la Condamine. Santos Dumont's accident on February 14, 1902. It was badly damaged on February 14, 1902 when superheating of the hydrogen caused the airship, already in a nose-up attitude, to pitch up even further, causing some of the wires supporting the gondola to break. Some of these then began to get entangled with the propeller. Santos-Dumont was forced to stop the motor and in order to prevent himself being blown out to sea, vented hydrogen to bring the airship down in the sea.Santos-Dumont (1904), p.256 The airship was salvaged and returned to Paris where it was repaired, and on Easter Monday 1902 it was placed on exhibition in the Concert Room in the Crystal Palace Park in south London, where it attracted 10,000 visitors on the first day it was shown. It remained on display throughout April and May, after which a series of exhibition flights were announced. During the static exhibition the envelope had been inflated with air, and when inflated with hydrogen it was found that the envelope had deteriorated and so the flights were cancelled.

His advice to Charles Kennedy and myself during the Iraq war was invaluable. We have also lost a close friend who was an unfailingly generous and warm-hearted man. The whole party extends its deepest sympathy to his wife and family.\\" Liberal Democrat deputy leader in the House of Lords, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, echoed Campbell's words: \\"Tim was both an expert and a radical, he offered invaluable advice on defence and foreign policy. He gave the Liberal Democrats depth in criticising the mistaken policy on Iraq, which was vitally important. He was also a very active parliamentarian, leading an all-party group on defence and conflict issues and on the delegated powers and instruments committee. We will miss him immensely.\\" Honours Garden was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1992, which was advanced to Knight Commander in 1994.

This belief, based on an elaborate interpretation of a passage from the biblical Book of Revelation, anticipated the advent of a heavenly kingdom somewhere in the wilderness during that year. Kelpius felt that the seventeenth-century Province of Pennsylvania, given its reputation for religious toleration at the edge of a barely settled wilderness, was the best place to be. Philadelphia had been founded in 1682, but the city and the Province of Pennsylvania had quickly become a tolerant haven and refuge for many pietist, communitarian, or free-thinking groups who were leaving the Old World for the congenial religious climate of the British colony. Kelpius and his followers crossed the Atlantic and lived in the valley of the Wissahickon Creek in Philadelphia from 1694 until his death. It is reported that they lived communally, though they also spent time in solitary meditation in caves and small cells scattered about their common living quarters. Though no sign or revelation accompanied the year 1694, the faithful, known as the Hermits or Mystics of the Wissahickon, continued to live in celibacy, searching the stars and hoping for the end. Cave of Kelpius located near Wissahickon Creek The so-called Cave of Kelpius is located by a small tributary stream of the Wissahickon in Philadelphia's present-day Wissahickon Valley Park, which is part of the Fairmount Park system of 63 city parks. Though the structure is alleged to be only a springhouse by some, as late as the 1940s it still had a chimney and fireplace, subsequently removed after some vandalism. Life Kelpius was born Johann Kelp in 1667, (American documents incorrectly placed his birth in 1673), near the town of Sch√§√üburg, Transylvania (now Sighi≈üoara, Romania) and attended the University of Altdorf, near Nuremberg, where his name was Latinized to Johannes Kelpius according to the custom of scholars of his days. By the age of 22 he had taken a master's degree in theology and published several works, including one in collaboration with Johannes Fabricius. At the university he had been drawn to Pietism, initially a reaction against the formalism of orthodox Lutheranism, but a term that sometimes included various esoteric or heretical Christian ideas. He became a follower of Johann Jacob Zimmermann, a mathematician, astronomer, and cleric, whose pastoral position had ended in 1685 due to his prediction of the imminent advent of a heavenly kingdom, as well as his criticism of the state church. Zimmermann was himself attached to the ideas of the mystic Jakob B√∂hme. After Zimmerman's sudden death, shortly before the group's departure for the New World, Kelpius became the group's magister or leader. The travel diary of Kelpius has been preserved. Some of the forty or so who traveled with him aboard the Sarah Maria Hopewell were Heinrich Bernhard Koster, Daniel Falckner, and Johann Gottfried Seelig. They disembarked at Bohemia Landing, Maryland and proceeded to Philadelphia and Germantown. On arrival in Philadelphia (which barely had 500 houses at this time) they moved to Germantown and then to the Wissahickon. There they established a regular program of private study and meditation. They eventually erected a large building for their meetings; some say they lived there communally, but others that they lived separately in caves and other rude shelters and cabins. They created a school for neighborhood children, held public worship services, and shared their medical knowledge. A few newcomers, including Conrad Matthai and Christopher Witt joined the group, but the community began to decline, especially after the death of Kelpius. Little is known of his death except for an account from years later which states that Kelpius had believed that he would not suffer physical death, but be translated to another existence. The same account suggests that Kelpius possessed the legendary philosopher's stone, which at his direction was cast into the Wissahickon or Schuylkill River shortly before he died near Germantown in 1708. His literary legacy is a collection of original hymns, a journal that includes many of his correspondences, and a book on prayer and meditation, A Short, Easy, and Comprehensive Method of Prayer, first published in English in 1761, and republished in 1951. However, this old translation has some inaccuracies, and English has changed over the more than two centuries since it appeared. Fortunately, a completely new translation has been completed by Kirby Don Richards, Ph.D.: A Method of Prayer. A Mystical Pamphlet from Colonial America. Dr. Richards' book includes both the German original and the new English translation. It also contains background materials that help explain the pamphlet and put it in its historical context. The book is now out of print. Kelpius was the subject of one of the first oil portraits in the thirteen British colonies; the painting was by Christopher Witt and initially was housed in the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, also home to Kelpius's journal, two collections of his original hymns, and other research source material. It's said to have been moved to the State Museum of PA located in Harrisburg. Music Kelpius was a musician, and he and his followers took with them instruments that became an integral part of church life. Kelpius was also a composer, and is sometimes called the first Pennsylvanian composer, based on his unproven authorship of several hymns in The Lamenting Voice of the Hidden Love. The 70-page hymnbook which he is believed to have composed is the earliest extant musical manuscript compiled in the thirteen British colonies. It is likely that he wrote the text, though the tunes are mostly based on German songs; four come from Christian Knorr von Rosenroth's Neuer Helicon (Nuremberg, 1684), and another four are from other German sources dated 1690 and later. The harmonies show considerable musical talent and skill. The English translations in the collection are attributed to his disciple Christopher Witt, an Englishman who joined the mystics. Witt is said also to have built them a pipe organ, said to be the first privately owned organ in North America. Literary references Until the recent novel Woman in the Wilderness by Jonathan D. Scott, Kelpius was remembered only in a few scattered references in literature. The nearly forgotten novelist George Lippard mentions \\"the monks of the Wissahikon\\" in his The Rose of Wissahikon. John Greenleaf Whittier borrowed from one of Lippard's short romances, based more on what should have been than on what actually happened, to include Kelpius in his 1872 poem Pennsylvania Pilgrim: Given the tone of the poem, it's worth noting that Kelpius and his followers were men of university training, with considerable knowledge in languages, sciences, and music, strange though they may have seemed to their contemporaries - and to us. Jonathan Scott's book (mentioned above) has a quite different tone. Scott imagines Kelpius shortly before his death offering this advice to a fellow seeker of wisdom: \\"... how precious are friendships and how difficult are goodbyes! ... grow into a full life of joy as well as wisdom. ... I beg you not to defer your life in expectation of some promised tomorrow, for our gift is the present.\\" References Further reading *\\"Kelpius, Johannes\\".

Osred was a child when his father died, and it is assumed that Eadwulf usurped the throne. Eadwulf's relationship, if any, to the ruling dynasty, descendants of Ida, is not known, but it is quite possible that he was indeed of royal descent as two or more other branches of the Eoppingas are found as kings of Northumbria after the extinction of the main line. Initially Eadwulf appears to have had the support of ealdorman Berhtfrith son of Berhtred, presumed to be the lord of the north-east frontier of Bernicia, in Lothian and along the Forth. However, a crisis soon arose. Bishop Wilfrid, exiled by Aldfrith, wished to return to Northumbria. Eadwulf aimed to keep the bishop an exile, but Berhtfirth appears to have supported Wilfrid's return. A short civil war, ending with a siege of Bamburgh, was won by Berhtfrith, Wilfrid and the supporters of Osred, and Osred was restored as child-king of Northumbria. Eadwulf appears to have been exiled to either D√°l Riata or Pictland as his death is reported by the Annals of Ulster in 717. His son Earnwine was killed on the orders of Eadberht of Northumbria in 740. Eadwulf's great-grandson Eardwulf and Eardwulf's son Eanred were later kings of Northumbria.

Vasili Yermolin is known to have been a merchant, contractor, and head of an artel of the Muscovite builders. In 1462, he restored the old parts of the whitestone walls of the Moscow Kremlin from the Sviblov Tower (known as the Vodovzvodnaya Tower today) to the Borovitskiye Gates. Also, Vasili Yermolin rebuilt the Frolovskiye Gates (today's Spasskiye Gates) in 1462-1464 and decorated them with polychrome reliefs depicting St George and St. Demetrius, protectors of the Muscovite princes. A fragment of the St. George relief is now on display in the State Tretyakov Gallery. The second relief was lost. Judging by the looks of the surviving fragment, both of them represented the finest examples of the old Russian sculpture. During the reconstruction of the Spasskaya Tower by an Italian architect Pietro Antonio Solari, these reliefs were affixed onto it and remained there until they redesigned its top in 1624‚Äì1625. Vasili Yermolin restored a church of the Ascension Monastery (–í–æ–∑–Ω–µ—Å–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –º–æ–Ω–∞—Å—Ç—ã—Ä—å) in the Kremlin between 1467 and 1469. In 1469, he built a refectory for the Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra which did not survive and renovated the church on top of the Golden Gate in Vladimir. In 1471, Yermolin was sent to rebuild the ancient Cathedral of St. George in Yuriev-Polsky, which had just collapsed. In 1472, he took part in preparations for the construction of the Assumption Cathedral in the Kremlin. At the request of Yermolin, they compiled the so-called Yermolin Chronicle, which contained information on different aspects of architecture and construction. There is speculation that some of the text was written by Yermolin himself.

The Orang Ulu tribal groups are diverse, they typically live in longhouses elaborately decorated with murals and woodcarvings. They are also well known for their intricate beadwork detailed tattoos, rattan weaving, and other tribal crafts. The Orang Ulu tribes can also be identified by their unique music - distinctive sounds from their sapes, a plucked boat-shaped lute, formerly with two strings, nowadays usually with four strings. They also practice Kanjet, a form of traditional dance. A vast majority of the Orang Ulu tribes are Christians, but old traditional religions are still practiced in some areas.

He was allocated Class 5C, the most unruly form in the school, at the beginning of term. At first relations were frosty between Bernard and Class 5C, but gradually Bernard gained the respect of his class and the rest of the staff. As the series progressed, he is shown to be a caring and very fair teacher and would always defend his form, regardless of how much evidence is put towards them. In the movie, he met air stewardess Penny Wheeler. After misinterpreting a 'few white lies' made by a pupil accidentally left behind, Penny began to take shine to Bernard. After a period of dating, Bernard attempted to propose to Penny but she already said yes before he could complete his sentence and they got engaged and later married. Shortly after Bernard got married, a new term started and was allocated Class 4C but it was not quite the same as 5C. He later resigned and left. Mr Norman Potter (Portrayed by Deryck Guyler). The pedantic and officious school caretaker. He claimed to have been a Desert Rat and constantly complains about the unruly behaviour of Hedge's class 5C. He is fiercely loyal (to the point of sycophancy) to the headmaster but a thorn in the side of the rest of the staff. His various comeuppances provide much of the ongoing humour of the sitcom.

Polityka, gospodarka i kultura europejskiego regionu. Christine van Eickels, S≈Çawomir Puk, ) was an Austrian Jesuit and important moralist. Laymann was born at Arzl, near Innsbruck. After studying jurisprudence at Ingolstadt, he entered the Society of Jesus there in 1594, was ordained priest in 1603, taught philosophy at the University of Ingolstadt from 1603-9, moral theology at the Jesuit house in Munich from 1609‚Äì25, and Canon law at the University of Dillingen from 1625-32. He died of the plague at Konstanz. He was one of the greatest moralists and canonists of his time, and a copious writer on philosophical, moral, and juridical subjects. The most important of his thirty-three literary productions is a compendium of moral theology Theologia Moralis in quinque libros partita (Munich, 1625), of which a second and enlarged edition in six volumes appeared in 1626 at the same place. Until the second quarter of the eighteenth century it was edited repeatedly (latest edition, Mainz, 1723), and was extensively used as a textbook in seminaries. Especially in the third edition of his Theologia Moralis, Laymann stands up resolutely for a milder treatment of those who had been accused of witchcraft. The reason why Laymann is often represented as an advocate of the horrible cruelties practised at trials for witchcraft lies in the assumption that he is the author of a book entitled Processus juridicus contra sagas et vene fico (Cologne, 1629). Quite in contrast with Laymann's Theologia Moralis, this book is a defence of the extreme severity at trials for witchcraft. Father Bernhard Duhr, S.J., has proved that Laymann is not the author of this work. See \\"Zeitschrift f√ºr katholische Theologie\\", XXIII (Innsbruck, 1899), 733-43; XXIV (1900), 585-92; XXV (1901), 166-8; XXIX (1905), 190-2. At the instance of Bishop Heinrich von Kn√∂ringen of Augsburg, Laymann wrote Pacis compositio inter Principes et Ordines Imperii Romani Catholicos atque Augustan√¶ Confessionis adh√¶rentes (Dillingen, 1629), an elaborate work of 658 pages, explaining the value and extent of the Religious Peace of Augsburg, effected by King Ferdinand I in 1555. Another important work of Laymann is Justa defensio S. Rom. Pontificis, augustissimi C√¶saris, S.R.E. Cardinalium, episco porum, principum et alioram, demum minim√¶ Societatis Jesu, in causa monasteriorum extinctorum et bonorum ecclesiasticorum vacantium . . . (Dillingen, 1631). It treats of the Edict of Restitution, issued by Ferdinand II in 1629, and sustains the point that in case of the ancient orders the property of suppressed monasteries need not be restored to the order to which these monasteries belonged, because each monastery was a corporation of its own. Such property, therefore, may be applied to Catholic schools and other ecclesiastical foundations. In the case of the Jesuit Order, however, he holds that all confiscated property must he restored to the order as such, because the whole Jesuit Order forms only one corporation. His work on canon law, Jus Canonicum seu Commentaria in libros decretales (3 vols., Dillingen, 1666‚Äì98), was published after his death.

History The Royal School of Military Survey (RSMS) originates from 1833 when it was established at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich as a survey training branch. After a period of stability the school moved to a number of locations including Chatham, Fort Southwick, Ruabon and Longleat before finally settling at Hermitage, Berkshire in early 1949, when it was renamed the School of Military Survey. The Hermitage site (strictly speaking it is in Curridge) was home to 42 Survey Engineer Group (Royal Engineers) and maintained close links with the Survey Production Centres (Royal Engineers), abbreviated as SPC(RE), at Bushy Park, Teddington and Park Royal (which amalgamated at Feltham in the 1960s and went through changes of name to Mapping and Charting Establishment (Royal Engineers) - MCE(RE) - in the 1970s before becoming part of Military Survey, later absorbed into The Intelligence Collection Group (ICG). In 1979 a major rebuild at Hermitage provided the school with purpose-built facilities. As part of Military Survey‚Äôs 250th Anniversary celebrations in 1997, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II awarded the school the Royal accolade. In April 2006 the RSMS became one of four federated schools within the Defence Intelligence and Security Centre (DISC) along with the Defence Schools of Intelligence (DSI), Languages (DSL) and Photography (DSOP). To exploit the growing synergies between Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) all Geospatial and Imagery analysis training and education is now the responsibility of RSMS. The school consists of three Training Wings: Geospatial Information Management and Geospatial Exploitation, based at Hermitage, and Imagery Intelligence, based at Chicksands in Bedfordshire. Courses Courses taught at RSMS range in duration from three days to 14 months. Geospatial education and training for Royal Engineer (RE) Geographic Officers, Defence personnel, and international students is provided through the MSc in Defence Geographic Information awarded by Cranfield University since 1993. From August 2009, this course has been developed into an MSc in Geospatial Intelligence to provide opportunities for Defence personnel to achieve an MSc through a variety of delivery modes including full-time at Hermitage, part-time, and distance learning. The change was in keeping with the evolution of defence survey and was very little more than a name change. The premier course offered by RSMS is the 14 month resident Army Survey Course (ASC). The ASC is designed to be a demanding program focusing on the various fields pertaining to geospatial information and its application within the defence community. Successful completion of the ASC results in the conferment of an MSc in Geospatial Intelligence from Cranfield University. In this relationship RSMS is responsible for course content, while Cranfield University is involved with oversight and program accreditation. Cranfield University and RSMS faculty meet regularly to ensure that each student is attaining the high standards required for graduation. Fully successful students graduate from Cranfield Defence and Security (CDS), based at Shrivenham, Oxfordshire, during the July following the course. Trade training for RE Geographic Technicians is recognised through a Foundation Degree in Applied Computing (Defence Geographic Information) accredited by Sheffield Hallam University (SHU). A recent development has been the addition of a bachelor's degree in partnership with SHU to provide RE Geographic Technicians with the opportunity to further develop their technical and academic competencies. In addition to the accredited courses, RSMS also delivers a range of specialist courses to Defence personnel, including Imagery Analysis, Full Motion Video Interpretation, GPS, Map Reading, Land Navigation, Geographic Information Systems and Terrain Analysis. The school is based at Denison Barracks in Hermitage, Royal County of Berkshire.

Born in Milan, Teruzzi completed military studies and was promoted colonel in the Italian Army at the unusual age of 28. In 1911, he served in Libya during the Italo-Turkish War ‚Äì taking part in the victory at Misrata (Misrata). He later captured Nalut, and was wounded in the battle over Fezzan ‚Äì being awarded the Silver Medal of Military Valor. After service in World War I (when he was again decorated), Teruzzi took leave from the army in 1920, in order to engage in Fascist politics. He was an enthusiastic adherent to Benito Mussolini's National Fascist Party, and the party's deputy-secretary in 1921 ‚Äì the year he also took part in the March on Rome, as a commander of Blackshirt squads from Emilia-Romagna. After the Fascist takeover, Teruzzi was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies in 1924 and gained successive terms. An undersecretary in the Ministry of the Interior in 1925‚Äì26, Teruzzi was governor of Cyrenaica in 1926‚Äì28, before returning to the military. He was Chief of Staff for the MVSN (the Milizia formed by the Blackshirts) from 1935; from 1937 to 1939, he was undersecretary in the Ministry for Italian Africa (Libya and Italian East Africa), and titular Minister from 1939 to 1943. During the Spanish Civil War, Teruzzi was promoted to Lieutenant General and appointed Inspector General of the Blackshirts. After Mussolini's ousting and Italy's exit from the World War II Axis Powers ‚Äì through the armistice in Cassibile at the end of July 1943, Teruzzi followed Il Duce in his Nazi-backed refuge in Northern Italy, and helped found the Fascist Italian Social Republic. He was also one of its most prestigious military leaders. In 1945, as the regime crumbled, rumors circulated that he had died ‚Äì they allowed him to escape the vigilance of the partisans, and he was able to retreat to a low-profile life in the southern countryside, dying in Procida. Teruzzi married Liliana Weinmann, a wealthy Polish Jew, in 1926, touring Europe. Attendees of the wedding include Benito Mussolini. The couple divorced in 1929. Liliana kept her title (countess) and last name.

He was the son of King Aldfrith of Northumbria. Aldfrith's only known wife was Cuthburh, but it is not known for certain whether Osred was her son. Osred did not directly succeed his father as Eadwulf seized the throne, but held it for only a few months. At the time that the usurper Eadwulf was overthrown, Osred was only a child, and the government was controlled by the powerful Bishop Wilfrid, presumably assisted by ealdormen such as Berhtfrith son of Berhtred. Osred was adopted as Wilfrid's son at this time. Wilfrid's death in 709 appears to have caused no instability at the time, which, together with the rapid rise and more rapid fall of Eadwulf, speaks to a degree of stability and continuity in early 8th century Northumbria which would not long outlast Osred's reign. In 711 ealdorman Berhtfrith inflicted a crushing defeat on the Picts, in the area around the upper Forth, but the reign of Osred is otherwise unremarkable politically. Domestically, a variety of ecclesiastical sources portray Osred as a dissolute and debauched young man, and a seducer of nuns. While Bede positively referred to Osred as a new Josiah, Aethelwulf's early ninth-century poem De Abbatibus describes Osred as energetic in deeds and words, mighty in arms and bold in his own strength. √Üthelwulf also refers to Osred as rash, foolish, and unable to control his desires (ll. 35-51) and also as a tyrant who forced many political enemies into monastic communities (ll. 49-51 and 65). Osred reached his majority in 715 or 716, and within a very short period he was killed. The manner of his death is unclear. The Anglo- Saxon Chronicle states that he was killed \\"south of the border\\". David Rollason and N.J. Higham presume that the border is question is the southern Pictish border, and that the Picts slew Osred. References * Higham, N.J., The Kingdom of Northumbria AD 350‚Äì1100.

History  This was the first ever mass-market mobile email. The hardware cost around US$100 and the service was initially US$9.95 per month for unlimited use. Later the monthly fee increased. After the company made a reference hardware design, leading consumer electronics manufacturers Audioxo, Sharp, JVC, and others made their own PocketMail devices. Later a PocketMail dongle was created for the PalmPilot. PocketMail users were given a custom email address or able to synch up PocketMail with their existing email account (including AOL accounts). Although actually a computer, its main function was E-mail. Its main advantages were that it was simple, and that it worked with any phone, even outside the United States. It was a low-cost personal digital assistant (PDA) with an inbuilt acoustic coupler which allowed users to send and receive E-mail while connected to a normal telephone, thus allowing use outside of mobile phone range, or without the need to be signed up with a mobile telephone provider. Popularity of the PocketMail peaked around 2000, when the company stopped investing in new technology development. In Australia, the company known as \\"PocketMail\\" in 2007 stopped marketing the PocketMail service, changed its name to Adavale Resources Limited and now owns uranium mining prospects in Queensland and South Australia.

The best-known of these was written by teacher and poet Bryan MacMahon (d. 1997) at the request of a local schoolmaster, P√°draig √ì Ceallach√°in. Historical background On 12 May 1921, a troop of Black and Tans were travelling out from Listowel towards Athea when they arrested four young unarmed men in Gortaglanna. Prior to this the barracks in Listowel had been burnt out and the troops, heavy with drink and bent on revenge decided to execute the young men. The first to be shot was Jerry Lyons. When this happened, Cornelius Dee decided, as he was going to be shot anyway, to make a run for it. He did, and almost immediately took a bullet in the thigh but managed to keep going. He ran for about three miles and survived. He was never recaptured but remained in hiding until the Truce.Shannonside Annual, 1958 The other two men were shot on the spot. Today a memorial stands by the roadside where the three died. A film about the events was made in 2009.

In his 60-year career at the University of Kansas (1946-2006), Falkenstien covered more than 1,750 men's basketball games and 650 football games, a span that included every game played in Allen Fieldhouse until his retirement, and was one of the longest announcing tenures in sports. By comparison, Vin Scully's 67 seasons with the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers is the record for longest broadcasting tenure with a single franchise in all of professional sports. Biography Falkenstien's father Earl was business manager of the KU athletic department for 33 years. Falkenstien's biology class at Liberty Memorial High School trooped over to KFKU, then KU's 50-watt radio station, in the early 1940s. \\"Each of us had to make some kind of comment -- it must have been a boring show,\\" Falkenstien reflected, \\"and a lady came up to me afterward and asked me if wanted to be in radio because I had such a clear voice.\\" Falkenstien's first job in radio was at WREN, then a Lawrence radio station. \\"A guy named Earl Bratten gave me some news copy to read and I got the job,\\" Falkenstien said. He worked before and after school and on weekends, usually 40 hours a week, and earned $90 a month. \\"The first time I ever went on the air was a Sunday morning to give a promo for an Eleanor Roosevelt broadcast,\\" Falkenstien said, smiling. \\"It was just a 30-second plug, but I was so scared when that red light came on.\\" Falkenstien graduated from Liberty Memorial High School in 1942, six months after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. After a semester at KU, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps in hopes of becoming a meteorologist. He left the service in March 1946. After leaving the service, he went back to work for WREN. His first assignment was to do the play-by-play for the NCAA district final game between KU and Oklahoma A&M; (now Oklahoma State University). He obtained a degree in mathematics from Kansas University in 1948. He also did play-by-play on TVS Saturday telecasts of Big Eight Conference games for several years. He was joined by Kansas State University broadcaster Paul Deweese. Credited with founding the KU Sports Network not long after World War II ended, Falkenstien quickly gave up the network because he really wasn't interested in earning a living as a play-by-play broadcaster. He was program and station manager of WREN radio from 1955 until 1967, when he had a falling out with the station's owner, former Kansas Governor Alf Landon. He then became the head of news and sports at WIBW radio and television from 1967 to 1970. After a one-year stint as the first general manager of Sunflower Cablevision, Falkenstien spent 23 years at Douglas County Bank, retiring as a senior vice president in December 1994. Final broadcasts Home Falkenstien's final broadcast in Allen Fieldhouse came on March 1, 2006, in the last home game of Kansas' 2006 basketball season, in which KU defeated Colorado, 75-54. Falkenstien was honored in a special halftime ceremony, which included his family, friends, some former KU players, and a speech from his on-air partner of 22 years, Bob Davis. Athletic Director Lew Perkins presented Falkenstien with a bronze Jayhawk to commemorate his long years of service to the University of Kansas. His name and \\"number\\" (60, for the number of years he had broadcast for the Jayhawks), were also hung on a banner in Allen Fieldhouse with those of the great players that have played for KU. This retirement ceremony made Falkenstien the 27th person so honored by the University, and the first non- athlete. This game was also held on Kansas' senior night, which honored senior players Christian Moody, Jeff Hawkins, and Stephen Vinson in a post-game ceremony. Away The last broadcast of Falkenstien's sixtieth season came on March 17, 2006, in the first round of the 2006 NCAA Tournament. The fourth- seed Jayhawks lost the game, 73-77, to the thirteenth-seed Bradley Braves of the Missouri Valley Conference. The last football broadcast of Falkenstien's career came in the 2005 Fort Worth Bowl, as Kansas defeated the Houston Cougars 42-13. Death Falkenstien died on July 29, 2019, at the age of 95.

Their portrayal is varied and can represent or subvert various stereotypes. Films Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracey in a publicity shot for Desk Set.According to Ann Seidl, director of the documentary The Hollywood Librarian, librarians in film are often portrayed as meek, timid, and unassertive in nature. After indexing hundreds of appearances of librarians in film, she found that \\"the shorter the reference to a librarian in a film, the worse the stereotype.\\" Additionally, in an article looking at library stereotypes perpetrated in Hollywood movies, academic librarian Jennifer Snoek-Brown argued that films, as well as TV shows, often get \\"library call numbers wrong,\\" but stated that \\"the usefulness, trustworthiness, and purpose of librarians\\" is often conveyed, and librarians in film are \\"becoming more ethnically diverse.\\" By the 1950s, movies had established the stereotype of librarians as \\"spinsters\\" and \\"eggheads\\". Thus, female movie librarians are usually unmarried, prim, and introverted. They are usually young and may be attractive, but dress drably and are sexually repressed. The \\"fate-worse-than-death view of librarians\\" is particularly evident in movies such as It's a Wonderful Life and The Music Man. In It's a Wonderful Life (1946), Mary Hatch Bailey (played by Donna Reed), is depicted as an \\"old maid.\\" It is also evident in films like Foul Play which features a shy San Francisco librarian fall in love with a \\"goofy cop.\\" In contrasts, male movie librarians ‚Äì mild, intelligent, and timid ‚Äì have fewer and less important roles. Another stereotype mentioned is the staggeringly rude and unhelpful librarian (John Rothman) in Sophie's Choice (1982), who barks at Sophie Zawistowski (Meryl Streep) \\"Do you want me to draw you a map?!\\" More recently and continuing the stereotype of unpleasant librarians, in the Disney/Pixar film Monsters University (2013), Alison Nastasi of Flavorwire says the university librarian \\"isn‚Äôt fond of noise and doesn‚Äôt think twice about tossing rowdy students out the window into a pond below\\". Another example of this librarian depicted in Citizen Kane. These negative portrayals are in contrast with such more well-rounded characters, such as librarian Bunny Watson (played by Katharine Hepburn) who teaches Richard Sumner (played by Spencer Tracy) a few things about modern research methods in the movie Desk Set (1957) and the no-nonsense \\"Marian the Librarian\\" (Shirley Jones) in the movie The Music Man. Mary (played by Parker Posey) as the ultimate Party Girl (1995) who discovers, \\"I want to be a librarian!\\" in a notable exception to the prim librarian stereotype. Librarians in film are usually ordinary people caught up in circumstances, rather than being heroes; likewise they are rarely villainous although they may have flaws, such as racism in Goodbye, Columbus. The Public, a 2018 movie by Emilio Estevez depicts a librarian, Stuart Goodson, who is comfortable with the homeless people who use his public library every day. Goodson becomes involved in a fight over doing the right thing: in this case finding shelter for the homeless on a bitterly cold night. Goodson, as the film reveals, has overcome his own personal demons in order to achieve a career as a librarian. Alicia Hull (played by Bette Davis), is a small town librarian, who befriends young Freddie Slater (Kevin Coughlin) but is herself ostracized for refusing to remove a book on Communism from the public library during the height of the Red Scare in Storm Center (1956). This movie was inspired by the real-life dismissal of Ruth Brown, a librarian in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. The comedy film Tomcats (2001) features Heather Stephens as Jill, a seemingly shy, repressed librarian who leads a double life as a lifestyle (nonoccupational) dominatrix. In Only Two Can Play (1962), Peter Sellers portrays a poorly paid and professionally frustrated Welsh librarian and occasional drama critic, whose affections fluctuate between glamorous Liz and his long-suffering wife Jean. In the comedic UHF by \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic, the character Conan the Librarian makes an brief appearance.Ruth Kneale, You Don't Look Like a Librarian: Shattering Stereotypes and Creating Positive New Images in the Internet Age, Information Today: 2009, p 77 This character has exaggerated muscles, speaks in Austrian-accented English patterned after Arnold Schwarzenegger's portrayal of Conan, chastises a library patron for not knowing the Dewey Decimal System, and slices a patron in two for returning a book overdue. Librarians can serve a function in fantasy films. In 1994's live-action animated film The Pagemaster, frightened and pessimistic Richard Tyler (Macaulay Culkin) meets an eccentric librarian, Mr. Dewey (Christopher Lloyd), who encourages Richard to get a library card and starting off an adventure. By the end of the film, Mr. Dewey is hinted at being the titular Pagemaster and none of the adventure in the film was a dream. Mr. Dewey introduced Richard to the adventures possible in libraries and books as he \\"knows just how magical of a place a library can be.\\" Similarly, a librarian appears in the beginning of the 1984 Hollywood box office hit, Ghostbusters and the \\"bitter old librarian\\" in Indiana Jones & The Last Crusade who thinks all the banging in the librarian is coming from his stamp, but it is actually coming from Indiana Jones \\"trying to break the floor apart. Similarly, in the 1983 film, Something Wicked This Way Comes there is a librarian in a small town who is the only person other than the protagonists who wants to face \\"the mysterious leader of an evil carnival\\" and Madam Irma Pince in the Harry Potter film series who heads the library at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and is fiercely protective of the books. Additionally, Henry DeTamble plays a reference librarian in The Time Traveler's Wife, who is thrust to the future or past but without his control. Finally, the main character of The Mummy (1999) is librarian named Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz), who is clumsy and later moves away from her profession in the sequels. A memorable quote from her, upon introduction to the other main character shows a more positive depiction of librarians: > Evelyn: \\"Look, I... I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a > treasure-seeker, or a gunfighter, Mr. O'Connell, but I am proud of what I > am.\\" Rick: \\"And what is that?\\" Evelyn: \\"I... am a librarian.\\" From 2004-2008, the John Rogers fantasy-adventure television film franchise, The Librarian, aired on TNT. The three films focus on a librarian (portrayed by Noah Wyle) who protects secret artifacts in the Metropolitan Public Library in New York. Literature Cosplay of Batgirl, who worked as a librarian in Gotham City when she was not fighting crime. Children's literature offers a generally positive portrayal of librarians as knowledgeable, helpful, amazing and friendly, becoming more positive over the course of the 20th century. Adult literature, however, portrays the profession more negatively. Between these, portrayals of librarians in young adult fiction are neutral to negative. Here librarians are predominantly female, middle-aged, usually unattractive in some way, and mostly unmarried. Personality is mixed between positive traits such as intelligence, likeability, and kind-heartedness; and negative traits such as strictness, timidity, excess fastidiousness, and eccentricity. While some provide assistance to the main characters, several are the villains of the story. Duties generally include reference, but may only show clerical tasks; however the amount of technology used by librarian characters has increased over time. Ashanti White, author of the 2012 book, Not Your Ordinary Librarian: Debunking the Popular Perceptions of Librarians, wrote that the shushing buttoned-down, older librarian was the most common depiction of librarians, in fiction, followed by the sexy librarian, stereotype. A disproportionate number of the librarians represented in novels are in the detective fiction genre, frequently as an amateur detective and protagonist. Although the stereotype of the librarian as \\"passive bore\\" does not seem reconcilable with the intensity of a mystery, the stereotypical librarian does share many traits with the successful detective. Their mindset is focused, calm, unbiased in considering viewpoints, and focused on the world around them. By personality they are industrious perfectionists‚Äîand eccentric. The drab and innocuous look of the stereotypical librarian is perfect for avoiding suspicion, while their research skills and ability to ask the right questions allow them to procure and evaluate the information necessary to solve the case. The knowledge they have gained from wide reading successfully competes with a private investigator's personal experience. For example, Jacqueline Kirby is drawn into the mystery in Elizabeth Peters' novel The Seventh Sinner (1972) due to her awareness of her surroundings. Wearing the stereotypical bun, glasses, and practical clothes, together with an eccentrically large purse, she is self-possessed and resourceful, knowledgeable in a variety of fields and skilled at research. Batgirl as Dr. Barbara Gorden in DC comics is depicted as working as librarian in Gotham City's Public Library. Librarians appeared in other literature as well. For instance, Neal Stephenson's novel Snow Crash features a commercialized melding of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Library of Congress, along with a virtual librarian who assists the main character, and raises questions of the role of the librarian in an increasingly information-rich world. Also, the eponymous character in Garth Nix's Lirael (2001) is an assistant librarian whose curiosity about the library she works in leads her into trouble and whose research skills save her. The head librarian is intimidating and the library itself is a dangerous place. At the same time, in the Sune series, Sune's mother Karin is a librarian who does not like comic books, a reference to the comic book debates of earlier decades.Sune och Svarta Mannen, Rab√©n & Sj√∂gren, 1989, 5-10 - Sunes familj There are other fictional librarians in literature as well. Allison Carroll in Jo Walton's Among Others serves as a mentor to the main protagonist and Madam Irma Pince is the librarian at Hogwarts during the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling. Madam Pince embodies many negative librarian stereotypes- she's controlling, intimidating, she shushes, and she values books over patrons. Similarly, the The Librarian in Terry Pratchett's Discworld fantasy series, a once-human wizard who manages the library at the Unseen University, Lucien serves on the Dream palace staff as chief librarian in Neil Gaiman's The Sandman series, and Welcome to Nightvale's Rabid Librarians will go to incredibly violent ends to ensure that the community is reading. Finally, ,any of the central cast of characters in The Library at Mount Char by Scott Hawkins refer to themselves as librarians, though their skillsets tend to be far more magical and violent that your average librarian stereotype. Television and streamed media Librarians have often been depicted in broadcast and streamed television series. CBS, NBC, Cartoon Network, and Disney Channel had a number of shows which depicted librarians. For instance, in season 2 episode 6 (\\"Caged\\") of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, a CBS show, actor Michael A. Goorjian plays Aaron Pratt, an autistic librarian who witnesses the death of a colleague. Pratt states that he has \\"a master's in library science and an English degree from UNLV.\\" Additionally, in an episode of another CBS show, The Crazy Ones, \\"The Monster\\", a drunk librarian named Flora (Melody Thomas Scott), who uses a lot of big and complex words, whose library is on a verge of shutting down but with the help of Simon and the group, her library was saved. NBC also featured librarians in one of its most popular shows. In the 2009 Parks and Recreation episode \\"Ron and Tammy\\", Leslie Knope's dreams of a local park are almost squashed by Tammy, the new library director at the Pawnee Public Library and Ron Swanson's ex-wife. Tammy places a claim for the lot that Leslie intended to use for her park. Tammy then tries to sexually manipulate Ron into giving her the lot for the library. Leslie calls librarians \\"diabolical, ruthless bunch of bureaucrats\\" as well as \\"punk-ass book jockeys.\\" In \\"Ron and Tammy: II\\", Leslie says Tammy is \\"just a manipulative, psychotic, library book- peddling, sex-crazed, she-demon.\\" Tammy also has books on \\"Approved\\" and \\"Rejected\\" shelves, which insinuate that the library operates in a biased manner. The depictions of the library on Parks and Recreation \\"illuminate the nature of library anxiety.\\" A more positive depiction appears in an episode of Cartoon Network's We Bare Bears, titled \\"The Library\\". In the episode, the old librarian lady helps Panda print Chloe's practice test, with the help of outdated technology in one scene. Finally, the Disney Channel featured librarians in four animated shows. In an episode of the series, The Replacements, titled \\"Quiet Riot\\", Todd replaces Mrs. Shusher, the shush-happy librarian, with a rock star at the same time their semester projects are due. At the same time, in the animated series Phineas and Ferb, Swampy (the drummer of Love H√§ndel) became the librarian after Love H√§ndel's disbandment and goes now by the name \\"Sherman\\". In an episode of Disney's Big City Greens, titled \\"Quiet Please,\\" a librarian at a city library shushes the protagonists and threatens to push them out if they make a sound. As a result, the protagonists communicate with each other using ASL after seeing two deaf library patrons communicating the same way. CBS, NBC, Cartoon Network, and Disney Channel were not alone in having characters who were librarians. In the PBS puppet series Between the Lions, which broadcast from 2000 to 2010, and promotes early reading to little children, features Theo and Cleo Lion as the librarians. Also, in an episode of Are You Afraid of the Dark? called \\"The Tale of the Quiet Librarian\\", an elderly librarian named Mercy MacGregor haunts the library during closing hours and uses the box to steal the patrons' voices, mostly noisy children. On the other hand, a SyFy show The Magicians (based on the series by Lev Grossman) has a strong focus on libraries. In the show, the Library of the Netherlands is an archive that contains all of the knowledge in the universe. Librarians formed the Order of the Librarians, a group that protects that knowledge. The Library is staffed by Zelda Schiff, a prim, glasses-and-cardigan wearing librarian whose biggest concern is possible defacement of library books. Uniquely, when creating the Australian miniseries The Librarians, co-producers and writers Wayne Hope and Robyn Butler consulted with real librarians for research, and took their advice to avoid shushing and cardigan-wearing librarian characters. This contrasts with the stereotypical school librarian, Rupert Giles in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer series. The character wears old-fashioned clothes and spectacles, is intelligent and well- read although he dislikes computers, and is overly concerned with following regulations, although he later is given an opportunity to develop beyond these stereotypes. There was also a TNT series, The Librarians, an extension of the eponymous film franchise of the same name. It follows a new team of librarians who solve mysteries, recover powerful artifacts, and fight against supernatural threats. Additionally, Belle plays a princess-turned-librarian in \\"Once Upon A Time\\", which broadcast on ABC. Various streamed shows have featured librarians. For instance, actress Christi Waldon appears in Stranger Things as Marissa, the librarian of the Hawkins Public Library, in season 1 episode 3 (\\"Holly, Jolly\\") and season 2 episode 3 (\\"The Pollywog\\"). Secondly, in Hilda, there is a character known as \\"The Librarian.\\" One reviewer called her character \\"among the most positive pop culture depictions of librarians,\\" apart with libraries in Cleopatra in Space and She-Ra and the Princesses of Power. The same reviewer states that that the nine minutes in the first season of Hilda within a library setting makes a \\"strong impression,\\" as it includes an episode featuring a special collections room. They further argued that the series makes clear the \\"importance of librarians and libraries for years to come.\\" In another article, the same reviewer looked at library settings in Cleopatra in Space and She-Ra and the Princesses of Power. In terms of the latter show, they noted the season 2 finale focuses \\"around two middle-aged gay Black librarians,\\" which contrasts with the depiction of a white and long- haired stereotypical librarian in She-Ra: Princess of Power, and argued that the series, as a whole, \\"shows librarians as helpful, welcoming, and diverse.\\" Apart from the above named shows, Orange Is the New Black, which streamed on Netflix as well, featured a librarian. Specifically, Tasha ‚ÄúTaystee‚Äù Jefferson, within the Litchfield Penitentiary with other women, is an outspoken librarian who is loyal, ambitious, and learned. Other media Librarians have appeared in interactive entertainment and in online mediums. They are often portrayed as guides and/or purveyors of knowledge who help the user progress within the game like in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim For instance, Monkey Island II: LeChuck's Revenge, a PC game from 1991, features a notably large library, complete with a female librarian who wheels around in her chair between shelves and shushes the protagonist. Then there is Stardew Valley an indie role-playing game released in 2016, features a town library and museum, staffed by Gunther, the museum curator. The museum is empty at the beginning of the game, and Gunther asks players to help fill it by donating artifacts and minerals and finding the library's lost books. On a similar note, in 2006 Microsoft introduced an early version of what was to become the Bing search engine that used over 600 pre-recorded video clips of actor Janina Gavankar, portraying the character of \\"Ms Dewey\\", described as a sexy librarian character. Ramirose Ilene Attebury, in Library Philosophy and Practice, reported she found that the sexy librarian stereotype was more popular than the old maid stereotype, in YouTube videos. Similarly, various songs focused on librarians. For instance, the retrospective compilation album of Tori Amos is called Tales of a Librarian, while My Morning Jacket's 2008 album Evil Urges features a song called \\"Librarian\\" and 2013 album of the American punk band Swingin' Utters, Poorly Formed includes a song titled \\"The Librarians Are Hiding Something.\\" Additionally, the song, \\"Karen\\" of the Go- Betweens' album Lee Remick (1978), is an ode to a librarian and Velocity Girl's 1993 album Copacetic contains the song titled \\"Lisa Librarian.\\" In the same vein, Mrs. Phelps in Matilda was a librarian. She worked to help young readers, giving their advice, saying things like \\"sit back and allow the words to wash around you, like music.\\" Librarians appeared in other media too, including model figures. In 2003, Archie McPhee brought out a librarian action figure, modeled on Seattle Public Library librarian Nancy Pearl. 28,000 action figures were sold in the first week of their availability. Wearing a suit, hair bun and glasses, the action figure sparked controversy, particularly for the button-triggered shushing motion. Many librarians took it in a light- hearted spirit, while others felt it perpetuated negative stereotypes. The original version of the action figure was discontinued, but Archie McPhee now sells a super-hero version of Pearl with a \\"removable cape and a deep understanding of how knowledge is organized.\\"  Stereotypes  Stereotypes of librarians in popular culture are frequently negative: librarians are portrayed as puritanical, punitive, unattractive, and introverted if female, or timid and effeminate if male. Such inaccurate stereotypes are likely to have a negative impact on the attractiveness of librarianship as a profession to young people. In modern times, the archetype of the \\"sexy librarian\\" has also begun to gain some traction, introduced in an effort to subvert the popular matriarchal image and make them more appealing to the average consumer. Both archetypes boil down to a similar idea, however ‚Äì an authoritative, implacable guardian of the books who, through either power or sex appeal, keeps the library patrons in fear and thus remains exclusive guardian of the otherwise obscure organization system in the library. In 2015, librarian Gretechen Keer gave a broader view, writing that these stereotypes have roots in anxieties about the librarian profession itself: > \\"We cannot separate our understanding of library stereotypes from the > history of librarianship that influenced their development in the first > place...There are numerous librarian stereotypes, with the most recognizable > being the middle-aged, bun-wearing, comfortably shod, shushing librarian. > Others include the sexy librarian, the superhero librarian, and the hipster > or tattooed librarian. These stereotypes are all characterized predominantly > as feminine, white women. Newer librarian stereotypes, particularly those > proffered by librarians themselves, tend to be depicted as younger white > women. The original librarian stereotype, which was superseded by the > introduction of his prudish sister, was that of the fussy (white) male > curmudgeon...Librarian stereotypes can be traced, in part, to cultural > anxieties about the emergence of the profession...we can conclude that, > despite being beloved by a number of prominent and not-so-prominent > individuals, librarianship as we know it is often treated in popular culture > as a low- status profession or not a profession at all...It is important to > acknowledge that stereotype threat is at work within librarianship because > of the raced, classed, and gendered reality of individual librarians‚Äô > lives.\\" See also * Films set in libraries category References External links *I Love Libraries - ALA initiative to promote the value of libraries *Reel Librarians ‚Äì a blog about librarians in film, plus filmographies, librarian character types, and extra resources *Librarian Wardrobe ‚Äì user- submitted blog of what real librarians look like and what they wear to work *You Don't Look Like a Librarian! ‚Äì a collection of resources relating to the perception of librarians in the Internet age *Libraries at the Movies ‚Äì a blog about the representation of libraries and librarians in movies *Librarians in the Movies ‚Äì an annotated filmography *The Hollywood Librarian *Songs about Libraries and Librarians *This is What a Librarian Looks Like ‚Äì going beyond the bun to challenge outdated librarian stereotypes Popular culture Category:Education in popular culture Librarians ","title":"Librarians in popular culture"},{"id":"4250412","text":"Christopher Trevor-Roberts (died 5 May 2005, aged 77) was a teacher who taught all four children of Queen Elizabeth II.

It was officially created on March 23, 1939 as the main pivot of Polish defence. It was commanded by Gen. Antoni Szylling. Originally, Krak√≥w Army was to be made of seven infantry divisions, two cavalry brigades and one mountain brigade. On September 1, 1939, General Szylling had the force which consisted of five infantry divisions, two cavalry brigades and one brigade of mountain infantry. Altogether, the army was made of 59 battalions, 29 squadrons, 352 cannons, 90 tanks, two armoured trains and 44 planes. These forces were not enough to halt German advance, especially in the area north of Czƒôstochowa, where Krak√≥w Army connected with ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Army. Main thrust of Wehrmacht panzer units was directed there, and this area was defended only by the Polish 7th I.D., which was destroyed in the early days of September 1939, opening the way towards central Poland.  Creation of Krak√≥w Army  On March 15, 1939, units of the Wehrmacht entered Prague, and two days earlier at Berlin, Joachim von Ribbentrop in a conversation with Polish ambassador J√≥zef Lipski demanded definite answer to German demands of Free City of Danzig and a highway through the Polish Corridor. On March 23, a number of officers of the Polish Army was ordered to come to the General Inspector of the Armed Forces in Warsaw. Together with General Antoni Szylling, these officers (Colonel Jan Rzepecki, Major W≈Çadys≈Çaw Steblik, Major Kazimierz SzpƒÖdrowski and Major Franciszek Chmura) were ordered to create staff of the newly created Krak√≥w Army. The army itself was created upon written order of Edward Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy, which was handed to General Szylling on the same day, together with more detailed demands. On March 25, staff officers of Krak√≥w Army arrived at Krak√≥w, staying at the Jan III Sobieski barracks, where the 5th Military Police Unit was located. On the same day at noon, General Szylling met commanders of the divisions that came under his control, and on March 27, the officers took their oath. Tasks Forces as of 31 August and German plan of attack. Forces as of 14 September with troop movements up to this date. Forces after 14 September with troop movements after this date Its main task was to delay advancing German troops and withdraw eastwards along the northern line of the Carpathians and defend the heavily industrialized Upper Silesia region, together with western counties of Lesser Poland and the Carpathian foothills. Altogether, Krak√≥w Army defended southwestern border of Poland, from Krzepice near Czƒôstochowa, to Czorsztyn. In the area of Czƒôstochowa, the 7th I.D. (General Janusz GƒÖsiorowski) was placed, with its right wing supported by the Krak√≥w Cavalry Brigade of General Zygmunt Piasecki. The remaining units were divided into two operational groups. Operational Group Silesia (under General Jan Jagmin Sadowski) was made of the 23rd I.D. (Colonel W≈Çadys≈Çaw Powierza), together with the 55th (reserve) I.D. (Colonel Stanis≈Çaw Kalabi≈Ñski), and soldiers manning the Fortified Area of Silesia. Operational Group Bielsko (under General Mieczys≈Çaw Boruta-Spiechowicz) was made of the 21st I.D. (General J√≥zef Kustro≈Ñ), and the 1st Brigade of Mountain Infantry (Colonel Janusz Ga≈Çadyk). This group was located in the area of ≈ªywiec, Chab√≥wka, and Bielsko-Bia≈Ça. Furthermore, in the area of Pszczyna was the 6th I.D. (General Bernard Mond), and in the area of Krak√≥w, the 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade (Colonel Stanis≈Çaw Maczek). Krak√≥w Army's tasks were as follows: * to defend Upper Silesia, * to protect the general direction towards the city of Krak√≥w from southwest, * to defend the strategic rail line from DƒÖbrowa G√≥rnicza ZƒÖbkowice to Czƒôstochowa, * final line of defence was as follows: Fortified Area of Silesia - Miko≈Ç√≥w - Pszczyna - Bielsko-Bia≈Ça - ≈ªywiec. Operational history  Battle of the Border  Krak√≥w Army fought against German Army Group South, whose units crossed the border on September 1, 1939, at 4 a.m. In central part of the front, German 10th Army advanced, attacking in the sector from Tarnowskie G√≥ry to Wielu≈Ñ. North of the 10th Army was the 8th Army (advancing towards Sieradz and ≈Å√≥d≈∫), and in the south was and the 14th Army, advancing towards Krak√≥w. On September 1, the Wehrmacht failed to cause a breach Polish positions, but it was obvious that the Germans tried to bypass Fortified Area of Silesia, attacking both north and south of the fortifications. As early as the night of September 1/2, Polish situation became difficult, as the 7th I.D., operating near Czƒôstochowa, found it hard to halt the advance of the panzers of the XVI Panzer Corps, which fought their way into central Poland. This division was located some 40 kilometers away from other Polish units; close to it was the Volhynian Cavalry Brigade, which itself was attacked by the Germans in the Battle of Mokra. On September 2, German 1st Panzer Division bypassed Czƒôstochowa north of the city, and supported by the Luftwaffe, managed to cross the Warta river. At the same time, Krak√≥w Cavalry Brigade was attacked by the 2nd Light Division in the area of Wo≈∫niki. After heavy fighting, it withdrew towards Zawiercie, which caused a breach in the defensive line, enabling the Germans both to bypass Polish fortifications in Upper Silesia, and to attack the 7th I.D. from the rear. As a result, the 7th I.D. was destroyed on Sept. 2, and its remaining units retreated to the forests near Koniecpol. This defeat enabled German XVI Panzer Corps to move towards Kielce without any problems. Since Polish Army did not have any reserve units east of Czƒôstochowa, Edward ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz ordered a detachment of the PZL.23 Kara≈õ bombers to attack the advancing panzers. The attack, however, did not result in a success, and the advance of the Wehrmacht continued. In the south, the Wehrmacht attacked on Sept. 2 in two spots - Miko≈Ç√≥w/Pszczyna, and Wysoka/Rabka. Near Pszczyna, Polish 6th I.D. failed to halt the 5th Panzer Division, and in the morning of the same day, the 2nd Panzer Division was stopped in the Battle of Jordan√≥w. At the same time, however, the Germans won the Battle of Wƒôgierska G√≥rka. In the afternoon of September 2, the situation of Krak√≥w Army turned critical. German panzers attacked in large formations in the area of Kozieg≈Çowy in the north, and in the area of Jordan√≥w in the south. Furthermore, breach of the Polish lines near Pszczyna caused another problem, as it gave the Germans an opportunity to bypass the Upper Silesian fortifications. As a result, General Szylling, in a conversation with Marshall ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz stated that it was necessary to withdraw from Upper Silesia and Zaolzie, and to retreat towards Krak√≥w. The Marshall gave tentative permission at 16:00 on Sept. 2, urging Szylling to press his soldiers to do their best. In the evening of September 2, the situation deteriorated further, as Krak√≥w Cavalry Brigade was pushed behind the Warta, and the distance to the retreating remnants of the 7th I.D. was some 30 kilometres. German 2nd Light Division entered this gap, advancing towards ≈ªarki. The Luftwaffe bombed Polish towns and rail junctions, General Szylling was unable to locate the positions of his divisions, and to get in touch with their commandants. At 18:00, Szylling once again talked with ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz, and 30 minutes later, the Marshall agreed to the withdrawal of Krak√≥w Army to the line marked by the Nida and Dunajec rivers. It was a difficult decision, as it meant that the pre-war Polish defensive plan (see Plan West) was abandoned. ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz, however, hoped that the retreat would save Krak√≥w Army from complete destruction.  The Retreat  In the evening of Saturday, Sept. 2, the order to retreat reached Polish units. Krak√≥w Cavalry Brigade, together with the 7th I.D. was to move towards Jƒôdrzej√≥w, halting the advance of the 2nd Light Division. 22nd Mountain I.D. was to withdraw towards Olkusz, and to support Operational Group Silesia (renamed into Operational Group Jagmin), which itself was to retreat behind the Przemsza. Operational Group Bielsko (renamed into Operational Group Boruta) was to withdraw behind the Skawa, and to take positions between Zator and Wadowice. General retreat towards the Dunajec and the Nida was to begin in the night of September 2/3.. General Szylling specified that units located in the centre of the front were to retreat first, to avoid being surrounded by German panzers advancing fast both in the north and the south. This plan failed, as Polish 7th I.D. was completely destroyed in the morning of Sunday, September 3, by the 14th Infantry Division, the 4th Infantry Division, and the 2nd Light Division. The retreat itself did not improve the situation of Krak√≥w Army, as it lost its fortified defensive positions, together with heavy equipment, which was abandoned. Polish historians Czes≈Çaw Grzelak and Henryk Sta≈Ñczyk in their book \\"Kampania polska 1939 roku\\" write that several historians question the decision of General Szylling, as in their opinion the decision to withdraw eastwards on the second day of the war was premature. Tadeusz Jurga wrote: \\"To remain in defensive positions would result in halting the advance of the German 10th Army, which later destroyed Prusy Army (...) Furthermore, defensive positions of Krak√≥w Army were based on fortifications, which had been built before the war. These fortifications eliminated technological superiority of the Wehrmacht. To abandon them and to fight in the open lowered defensive abilities of Krak√≥w Army\\".Tadeusz Jurga, Obrona Polski 1939. Warsaw 1990, page 313 The decision to abandon southwestern Poland had far-reaching consequences, as Krak√≥w Army was the centre point of the defensive plan. Its new line of defence along the Dunajec and the Nida was ill-prepared, and the retreat itself turned out to be very difficult, as Polish units were under constant pressure of the Luftwaffe and German motorized divisions. In the morning of September 3, General Szylling ordered general retreat east of Krak√≥w, dividing his army into Operational Group Jagmin (north of the Vistula, consisting of the 23rd, the 55th and the 22th I.D.'s, together with Krak√≥w Cavalry Brigade, and soldiers of Fortified Group Silesia), and Operational Group Boruta (south of the Vistula, consisting of the 6th and the 21st I.D.'s, the 10th Motorized Brigade, and the 1st Mountain Brigade). Szylling hoped to reach the defensive line by September 7, and first days of retreat were relatively calm, as the Wehrmacht concentrated its efforts in the area of Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski.  The End of Krak√≥w Army  On September 5, German 2nd Panzer Division, together with the 3rd Mountain Division and the 7th Infantry Division broke through Polish lines near Pcim, capturing My≈õlenice, Bochnia and Wi≈õnicz, thus positioning themselves in the rear of the retreating units of Operational Group Boruta. On the same day, Fall 5 September instruction was issued by the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, ordering German divisions to continue their advance towards Tarn√≥w and Rzesz√≥w. On September 6, German 4th Light Division attacked Polish 24th I.D. near Tarn√≥w, crossing the Dunajec south of Zakliczyn. Polish unit managed to halt the Germans, and its commandant, Colonel Boles≈Çaw Krzy≈ºanowski hoped to keep the line of the Dunajec for Operational Group Boruta. In the evening of September 6, General Kazimierz Fabrycy ordered him to retreat to the Wis≈Çoka river. On the same day, Polish units abandoned Krak√≥w. On September 6, Marshall ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz reorganized the units fighting in southern Lesser Poland. Operational Group Boruta was moved to Karpaty Army, and soon afterwards, Karpaty Army was merged with Operational Group Jagmin, creating Ma≈Çopolska Army, under General Fabrycy. ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz was well aware of the fact that it was impossible to hold the line of the Dunajec and the Nida, and that further retreat towards the San was the only option. Organization The Army was commanded by general Antoni Szylling; his chief of staff was colonel S. Wiloch. It consisted of five infantry divisions, one motorized cavalry brigade, one mountain brigade and one cavalry brigade. The 22nd Mountain Infantry Division (Colonel Leopold Endel-Ragis) was supposed to be the reserve of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Army, but due to destruction of rail connections, this division never reached its destination in central Poland. It concentrated near Krzeszowice and Trzebinia, and on September 2 joined Krak√≥w Army, replacing the 7th I.D., which had been destroyed near Czƒôstochowa. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"font-size: 85%; border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;\\" - style=\\"background: #ececec;\\" !

It was later ported as a DVD game and for the PlayStation 2 (PS2) and PlayStation Portable (PSP). The story, a dramatic slice-of-life, follows Makoto Ito, a high school student who becomes the ambivalent love interest of several girls during his second term, and the effects this has on himself and his relationships with other characters. Though the game requires little interaction from users, School Days engages the player through a plot that they are given opportunities to change the course of during play. The game concludes with an ending specific to the outcome of the story, some of which became notorious for their graphic violence. 0verflow announced work on School Days in October 2004 and marketed it through public venues that showcased the game's innovative use of anime- like cinematics and voice. The game ranked as the best-selling visual novel in Japan for the time of its release, continuing to chart in the national top 50 for nearly five months afterward. 0verflow would then go on to produce multiple sequels including a spin-off of the original story called Summer Days, and a parallel story called Cross Days. Another spin-off, Island Days, has been developed by Klon for the Nintendo 3DS. School Days was remastered as School Days HQ on October 8, 2010, and localized in North America on June 27, 2012. The original game was officially discontinued on April 21, 2011. Following the game's release, School Days made several transitions into other media. The original story was adapted into a manga and serialized in the Kadokawa Shoten magazine Comp Ace; it was later published into two volumes. Comic anthologies, light novels and art books were also published, as were audio dramas and several albums of music. An animated television series, two direct-to-video (OVA) single releases and a concert film were also produced, the first of which became a precursor for an internet meme when its finale was pulled from broadcast. Gameplay Example of a selection screen from the North American release of School Days HQ. Here, Kotonoha has asked Makoto a question. Players may choose one of the available options or none at all. As a visual novel, School Days contains extremely minimal gameplay. The game's core onscreen presentation is composed of scenes that are viewed from a mostly third-person perspective. At predetermined intervals, the game pauses, and players are presented with one to two responses or actions relevant to the scene in progress to make, or not make, on behalf of characters. Each selection branches the game's progress up to that point in an alternate direction, while also causing the player's love toward a character to blossom, plateau, or diminish, thus providing for a nonlinear storytelling experience. Being an erotic title, relationships between characters may become sexual; scenes of this kind depict a varying combination of French kissing, masturbation, oral sex, intercourse, and nudity (both female and male) or a combination thereof. Genitalia are pixelated in the original Japanese releases, but the Western release of School Days HQ is uncensored. Sex scenes are omitted from the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable ports of the game. Each route the game takes invariably concludes with an ending specific to the choices made up to that point. Depending on these choices, the outcome of the story will either be good or bad. School Days became popularly known for its bad endings, which depict the deaths of characters. In one ending titled \\"Bloody End\\", a yandere Kotonoha slits Sekai's jugular vein open with a d≈çzuki, causing Sekai to collapse and die in a fountain of blood to the manic laughter of her assailant and the horror of Makoto. In another called \\"Forever\\", Kotonoha commits suicide leaning over and falling off the roof of a school, landing headfirst on a sidewalk to the horror of Makoto and Sekai. The game's good endings, by contrast, depict the well-being of characters and their relationships. In the ending \\"Christmas Eve\\", Makoto and Kotonoha share an embrace and make love in a hotel room as snow falls around a surrounding cityscape. In another titled \\"Two Lovers\\", Kotonoha and Sekai agree to have a polyamorous relationship with Makoto instead of rivaling with each other. Because of the numerous alternate endings that can be achieved, players who wish to watch additional endings and sex scenes will have to play through the game more than once. Unlike traditional visual novels that consist of static characters with subtitled dialogue, School Days is unusual in that it incorporates motion and voice, making it reminiscent of an animated series. Cinematics naturally play on their own, and players are afforded the ability to pause, fast-forward, and even skip those they've seen before. Male and female voices can be muted, subtitles can be turned on or off and the game can be played from a window or fullscreen ratio. Progress can be saved at any time in up to 100 slots and loaded from either the main menu or during play. Plot School Days focuses on the life of Makoto Itou, a first-year high school student living with his divorced and unseen mother in the fictional city of Haramihama. During his second term, he becomes infatuated with Kotonoha Katsura, a soft-spoken schoolmate who shares train rides with him to and from campus. When the classroom seating plan of his class is rearranged, he becomes acquaintances with Sekai Saionji, an upbeat girl who takes a special interest in his newfound crush, befriending the two and providing them the grounds to meet. Despite her triumphant efforts, however, Sekai becomes jealous of the new couple, having developed feelings for Makoto herself. Development School Days was 0verflow's tenth game to develop. News of School Days first surfaced on October 5, 2004, when 0verflow posted a link to the game's then-live website and development log on their official site. In the blog, 0verflow revealed that School Days had been in pre-production for roughly two years and would be a fully animated game. Updates on the development of the game were scheduled for Tuesdays and Fridays, and the company encouraged fans to attend Dream Party 2004, an upcoming anime convention at Tokyo Big Sight in Ariake, on October 11, where it would make its first public showcase of the game and characters. A follow-up of the venue was made on October 15. Toward the end of the month on October 26, 0verflow posted that new information about School Days would be circulated in the November issue of Tech Gian, an adult magazine published by Enterbrain. Promotion for the game began shortly after. In a November 6 development post, 0verflow announced that it was planning a public screening of new game material, but was experiencing difficulty acquiring space for it. The company had initially chosen to have the venue in Akihabara but was unable to find a retailer willing to host it, prompting a visit to Osaka the following week. News that the game would contain music by artists such as Minami Kuribayashi, Haruko Momoi, Yozuca* and YURIA was posted on November 30, along with a release date change to February 25, 2005. On December 28, 2004, 0verflow released a public trial of School Days and announced that the company would be attending Comiket 67 at Tokyo Big Sight from December 29 to 30, handing out phonecards to the first 50 visitors to their booth. Two months later, on February 2, 2005, the company announced that the game had been postponed again to April 28. From April 5 to April 8, 0verflow concluded their development log with comments from Soyogi T≈çno, Kaname Yuzuki, Tatsuya Hirai, Yuki Matsunaga, Hikaru Isshiki and Hana Yamamoto, the respective voices of Kotonoha, Sekai, Makoto, Otome, Hikari and Setsuna. To address bugs that were later found in the game, 0verflow released a patch to bring School Days to a stable build of 1.11. On June 26, 2007, 0verflow and Lantis-net radio began to air an internet radio drama called \\"Radio School Days\\". Broadcasts finished on March 28, 2008, with 39 episodes aired. On April 21, 2011, 0verflow announced via their blog that support for School Days was being discontinued. Release School Days was ported to three other platforms. The first of these was by AiCherry, an interactive movie developer, who announced on August 20, 2007, that it had picked up the game for development, releasing it as a four disc DVD game on September 28. That same year, on August 31, Interchannel posted a link on their blog to the official website of School Days L√óH, a PlayStation 2 (PS2) port in development by Guyzware, that would be edited of explicit sexual content. The game was released on January 17, 2008 and assessed by the Computer Entertainment Rating Organization (CERO), Japan's primary video game content rating system, receiving a 15-years-or-older \\"C\\" rating for sexual themes and profanity. The third and final port was developed by PalaceGame for the PlayStation Portable (PSP). After postponing the game on May 11, it was released as four UMDs on June 30, 2010. 0verflow opened what would become the homepage for School Days HQ on May 21, 2010, a remastering of the original game initially scheduled for release in August. The site was finished June 3, and on July 16, the game was postponed to September 24. A trial was publicly released for download on August 7, and from August 20 to September 28, 0verflow promoted the game. Customers who had purchased the original School Days would be given the opportunity to upgrade to HQ for a fee until October 11, by either mailing in their game disc or visiting stores in Akihabara, Osaka or Nagoya. Distributors offered collectable phonecards for reservations, and after a second date change on September 10, the game was released October 8. On March 3, 2011, 0verflow acknowledged Sekai Project, an unofficial fan translation group, who had reportedly begun localizing School Days in April 2006. Partnering with American distributor JAST USA, School Days HQ, uncensored in English, was announced for a North American release on March 11, 2011. Development instead continued into 2012, and on May 18, JAST announced that the company had begun taking pre-orders for the Collector's Edition, a bundled release of the game packaged with a keychain and mousepad. The company announced weeks later on June 1 that School Days HQ had gone gold. Following news on June 26 that the company would exhibit the game at Anime Expo 2012, JAST made an update to the June 1 announcement that School Days HQ had begun shipping. The downloadable version of the game was later released on August 6. Sales In a national sales ranking of bish≈çjo games in PCNEWS, a now- defunct Japanese online magazine, School Days premiered as the number one game sold for the second half of April 2005, the second and seventeenth for the first and second halves of May, the fifth and twenty-sixth for the first and second halves of June, and twenty-seventh for the first half of July. The School Days renewal edition, released a week after the previous ranking, continued to chart on behalf of the game; it ranked as the thirty-third most sold game for the second half of July, before ending as the thirty-fifth and forty-ninth for the first and second halves of August. Getchu.com, a major distributor of visual novels and domestic anime products, recorded similar sales. School Days for Windows premiered as the number one game sold for the month of its release, and seventh most for May, ranking as the number one game sold for the first half of 2005 and ninth for the year. The following year, the School Days renewal edition charted as the twentieth most sold game for July 2007, dropping to thirtieth from August to October. School Days HQ ranked as the sixth most sold game for October 2010 but failed to chart thereafter. According to Gamasutra, a video gaming news site, School Days L√óH ranked as the number one PlayStation 2 game sold for January 2008. Media Related visual novels 0verflow developed several visual novels related to School Days, sharing the same universe. Prior to the development of School Days, 0verflow developed the Radish Vacation visual novel series. The first is Snow Radish Vacation released on December 28, 2001, followed by Summer Radish Vacation on April 1, 2003, and finally Summer Radish Vacation 2 on August 13, 2004. A spin-off titled Summer Days, was released on June 23, 2006, retelling the original game during summer vacation and from the perspective of Setsuna Kiyoura. Unlike its predecessor, however, Summer Days was almost universally panned for its heavily bugged state, loads of patches, and recall. Another spin-off titled Cross Days was released on March 19, 2010. Set in the same continuity as School Days, Cross Days follows the life of another protagonist, Yuuki Ashikaga, a high school freshman who also finds himself caught between the affection of two girls, Roka Kitsuregawa and Kotonoha Katsura, during his second term at Sakakino Academy. The game also features yaoi scenarios, during which Yuuki cross-dresses as a maid. 0verflow released Shiny Days on February 2, 2012, which is a remastered version of Summer Days with a new heroine and higher quality animations. A third spin-off, Island Days, was developed for the Nintendo 3DS and was released in Japan on July 3, 2014. The game, developed by Klon, focuses on Makoto and the girls becoming trapped on a remote island and includes tower defense elements. Manga Based on the story of the original game, School Days was reimagined as a manga, illustrated by Homare Sakazuki and serialized in the Kadokawa Shoten magazine Comp Ace from May 26, 2006 to September 26, 2007. On July 12, 2007, 0verflow announced that the manga had been collected into its first volume, comprising five chapters set to be released on July 26. Later that year, the second and final volume, comprising the remaining seven chapters, was released on November 26. Various artists also produced short manga of School Days that were compiled into two comic anthologies. The \\"School Days Comic Anthology\\" was released by Ohzora Publishing on October 25, 2005, under their P-mate Comics imprint, containing nine short manga by individual artists. On February 25, 2008, Ichijinsha printed the \\"School Days Kotonoha Anthology\\" under their DNA Media Comics imprint, a collection of manga primarily featuring the character Kotonoha Katsura. Books and publications In addition to the manga, School Days was adapted into other print media. The first of these was the \\"School Days Visual Guide Book\\" published by Jive on September 16, 2005, an artbook of character illustrations, model sheets, screenplay, storyboards and a visual hierarchy of the choices and corresponding scenes in the game. Separate editions for the anime television series and Playstation 2 game were also published, on December 1, 2007 and March 21, 2008, respectively. Collections of production work from the Windows game such as character and environment art, screenplay, artist commentaries and all manufactured promotional items were collected in the on December 16, 2005 and also featured in the \\"SummerDays & School Days Visual Collection\\" on August 31, 2006. The first of four light novels, all illustrated by Junji Goto, was written by Ryuna Okada and printed by Harvest Publishing under their Harvest Novels imprint. Released on December 1, 2005, retells the original story from the perspective of Sekai. Okada would follow up the book with on January 1, 2006, switching to the perspective of Kotonoha. Two light novels were also published by Jive, the first of which was written by Takuya Baba, and printed on December 16, 2005, and a second by Hiro Akiduki, \\"School Days: Innocent Blue\\", released on April 28. Anime School Days was adapted into a twelve- episode anime television series by TNK. Concrete news of this first appeared on June 1, 2007, when 0verflow announced via its blog that the show's official website had gone live. Stations participating in the broadcast included TV Kanagawa, Chiba TV, TV Aichi, TV Osaka, TV Saitama and AT-X, the premiere of which would air on TV Kanagawa on July 3. The anime was aired until September 27 and finished its broadcast on AT-X. From September 26, 2007, to February 27, 2008, the series was compiled into six limited and regular edition DVDs. TNK also produced two direct-to-video (OVA) episodes of School Days. The first, titled \\"Valentine Days\\", was bundled with limited edition copies of School Days L√óH, and features an unrelated comedic romp through Valentine's Day as Kotonoha, Sekai, and Otome try to give Makoto giri chocos. The second, \\"Magical Heart Kokoro-chan\\", jaunts the series into magical girl territory, portraying Kokoro Katsura as the superheroine Magical Heart; it was released on March 26, 2008. Discotek Media has acquired the television series and the \\"Magical Heart Kokoro-chan\\" OVA to be released on DVD on June 24, 2014, with English subtitles. =Delay of finale= Screenshot of the MS Skagast√∏l as it appeared in the original compilation footage. The \\"Nice boat.\\" comment and subsequent meme would derive from this. On September 17, 2007, the day before the twelfth and final episode of the televised anime was to air on TV Kanagawa, a sixteen-year-old girl murdered her forty-five-year-old father in their Kyoto home with an axe. TV Kanagawa promptly cancelled the Tuesday airing of the finale for its similarly violent content, replacing it instead with a thirty-minute video compilation of scenery footage from Europe including Norway, played to August Wilhelmj's \\"Air on the G String\\". Newspapers such as The Japan Times and Mainichi Shimbun reported on the killing and episode preempt on September 19. According to Mainichi Shimbun, Chiba TV and TV Aichi had also cancelled their airings, with AT-X the only station remaining indecisive. 0verflow issued an apology through their blog the same day, asking viewers to stay tuned for updates. In the following week, 0verflow announced that it had arranged for two screenings of the edited finale at the Akihabara 3D Theater on September 27. Those wishing to attend would be required to register a seat by email, be at least 18 years old with photo ID, and bring a Windows copy of School Days or Summer Days. That same day AT-X announced that it had decided to air the unedited finale on September 27 and October 1. In the wake of the broadcast change, a screen capture of the Norwegian M/S Skagast√∏l from the slideshow surfaced on the Internet alongside the caption \\"Nice boat.\\", a phrase which gained popularity in Japan. Google Trends recorded a spike in \\"Nice Boat\\" searches around the third-quarter of 2007 while Yomiuri Shinbun, a Japanese newspaper, reported that \\"Nice boat\\" was the tenth most popular Yahoo! Japan search from September 17 to September 23. Nice Boat had become so well known that it was used in other media. The meme appeared as an Easter egg in the first episode of Ef: A Tale of Memories., and was parodied on February 13, 2009, when the Kadokawa Pictures YouTube channel uploaded a short montage of sailboats instead of the previously scheduled premiere of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. 0verflow capitalized on the popularity of the phrase, naming their booth at Comiket 73 \\"Nice boat.\\" and selling meme-inspired merchandise. TNK also paid homage to the meme in \\"Magical Heart Kokoro-chan\\", a special direct-to-video episode of the animated series. Concert film Besides the video releases of the School Days anime, a concert film, the School Days Secret Live DVD, was also produced by HOBiRECORDS. Released on June 26, 2006, in conjunction with Summer Days, the film contains footage of a concert held on June 15, 2005 featuring the performances of Miyuki Hashimoto, YURIA, rino, yozuca* and Minami Kuribayashi. Audio CDs From 2005 to 2010, Lantis published six albums of School Days music. The \\"School Days Vocal Album\\", a compilation featuring all nine of the game's closing themes, as performed by artists Kiriko, Yozuca*, Miyuki Hashimoto, Yuria, Halko Momoi, Minami Kuribayashi, Rino, and Kanako Ito was the first to be distributed, sharing its April 28, 2005, date with the release of the game itself. The remaining twenty-eight background scores, composed by KIRIKO/HIKO Sound, were released on July 21, officially completing the game's soundtrack. Another compilation, the \\"School Days Vocal Complete Album\\" featuring songs from Summer Days and Cross Days, was released on October 8, 2010. Three weeks after the premiere of the televised anime on July 25, 2007, Lantis published the single \\"Innocent Blue\\" by DeviceHigh, a four- track disc featuring the anime opening of the same name, a disco-inspired song called Dancin' Joker, and their instrumentals. Lantis followed with \\"School Days: Ending Theme+\\" on August 22, a sixteen-track disc containing all of the show's closing themes and background scores on September 26. In addition to music albums, six audio dramas were also produced. \\"School Days Little Promise\\", a chronicle of Sekai and Setsuna's childhoods, was the first. Featuring music by Kiriko/Hiko Sound and Kanako Ito, Hobirecords published \\"Little Promise\\" as a two-disc set, which 0verflow scheduled for release January 27, 2006. Pre-releases were sold at Comiket 69 from December 29 to 30, 2005. Sometime afterward however, 0verflow announced that pre-released copies of Little Promise were defective, and asked customers to mail in their discs for replacements. The release was also postponed to February 24. Lantis released the remaining five dramas. \\"School Days Drama CD Vol. 1 Himitsu Hanazono\\" („Éí„Éª„Éü„Éª„ÉÑ„ÅÆËä±Âúí), a merrymaking of the series six main girls, was released on August 8, 2007. A second, \\"School Days Drama CD Vol 2. Koi no Nou-hau\\" (ÊÅã„ÅÆ„Éé„Éª„Ç¶„Éª„Éè„Éª„Ç¶), was released October 24, 2007. Radio School Days was compiled into three separate albums: was released on November 21, 2007, on February 6, 2008, and on June 21. Merchandise Considerable effort was made to market and promote School Days before and after its release, including the sale of brand merchandise and use of incentives. Through public venues and through the company's online store, 0verflow sold brand keystraps, mousepads, phonecards, book covers, mugs, t-shirts, dakimakura cases, PVC figures, lanyards, business card holders and cosplay material such as the girls' school uniforms and plastic d≈çzuki. Reception UK Anime Network, a British online anime and manga magazine, gave the television series a 7 out of 10, summarizing it as \\"An utter subversion of the high school romance genre, which is disturbing and unsettling... yet oddly compelling in its own way.\\" THEM Anime Reviews, a website devoted to the review of anime, gave the series a less favorable 1 out of 5 stars, citing \\"overblown, shallow, and flat\\" characters and that although \\"School Days looks fascinating when you see screenshots of it and read episode guides\\", the reviewer found it to be \\"annoying, stupid, mean-spirited, and full of some of the biggest idiots [he had] seen in an anime in a long time.\\" On June 12, 2015, the Chinese Ministry of Culture listed School Days among 38 anime and manga titles banned in China.

Introduction Hicks originally sang with an R&B; band called the Fabulous Fug Band and at one time sent a demo of her vocals alongside Aretha Franklin's \\"Giving Him Something He Can Feel\\" to Phil Collins. However she continued to remain unsigned and moved to London working as a secretary and singing with a band called Mixed Fruits. She signed to Island Records and her first single, \\"I Wanna Be Your Lady\\" was released in late 1997, followed by her first album, eponymously titled Hinda in 1998. Hicks co-wrote the songs on Hinda. Early success Hick's first released single failed to make the UK Singles Chart, although a more concerted promotional campaign saw \\"If You Want Me\\" chart at number 25 in February 1998. She followed this up with the release of \\"You Think You Own Me\\" in May of the same year, which reached number 19. Her fourth single, a re-release of \\"I Wanna Be Your Lady\\" achieved her highest chart position to date, at number 14 in August 1998. During the summer of 1998 Hicks promoted both her single and album on mainstream television and radio shows in the UK and she took supporting roles on tours with Boyzone amongst others. By the end of that year \\"Truly\\" had charted at number 31. Second album Having begun work on her second album Hicks released \\"My Remedy\\", in 2000 but Island Records' merger with Universal Records and an apparent lack of promotion saw it falter at number 61 in the UK chart. Originally the second album was due for a late 2000 release. A handful of promotional copies and limited releases were made available, but commercially the launch was aborted and Hicks and her record company parted ways. In between record companies and albums, Hicks found time to record vocals on other artists' tracks. This included \\"Let's Do It Again\\" with the late Lynden David Hall, which featured on his album, The Other Side and a compilation album (Pure R&B; Volume 2)Released 13 November 2001 on the Telstar Records label together with Brand New Day with Terri Walker, appearing on Walker's Untitled album, released 3 March 2003 on the Mercury Records label. A new album was finally released in July 2004, now titled Still Doin' My Thing on a small R&B; label, Shout Out Records, and containing a different track listing to Everything to Me. The single \\"Up Up\\" from Still Doin' My Thing was released in the summer of 2004 and once again with Hicks failing to repeat her successes of six years previously the single did not make the Top 40. Third album and the future In February 2007 Hicks' MySpace page announced that a third album (then untitled) would be released in 2010, however after two years later the album has now been shelved as Hinda has given up on music to focus on other roles.Hinda Hicks on MySpace.com As of November 2008, Hicks was listed as part of a London-based artistic and music collective created by the DJ and producer Yvan Healer Selecta and called Raison d'Etre [sic].

Spider-Man #234 (January 2018). Marvel Comics. Amadeus Cho Wears in several TV shows and comics, including \\"The Totally Awesome Hulk\\". Powers and abilities Supported by a system similar to that of Tony Stark's classic Iron Man design, The Iron Spider armor features many gadgets, including three mechanical spider-arms, or \\"waldoes\\", that can be used to see around corners (via cameras in the tips) and to manipulate objects indirectly. Stark describes them as too delicate to use in combat, yet Spider-Man shortly afterward uses them to smash through the sensors in Titanium Man's helmet. Later on during the \\"Civil War\\" ark, he uses them (reluctantly) during his fight with Captain America. Other features include short-distance gliding capability, limited bulletproofing, built-in fire/police/emergency scanner, audio/visual amplification (including infrared and ultraviolet), cloaking device, carbon filters to keep out airborne toxins, and a short-range GPS microwave communication system. It grants the ability to breathe under water, and can morph into different shapes due to its \\"'smart' liquid metal\\" form. It can also \\"more or less disappear\\" when not needed due to reactions to neurological impulses as Tony Stark revealed. The new costume is able to look like other styles of costumes Spider-Man has worn over the years or turn into his street clothes. Part of the costume can detach itself from Spider-Man to cover an object too dangerous to touch, such as a radioactive asteroid. All these features are controlled by a computer system in the chest piece. The suit responds to mental control.The Amazing Spider-Man #530. Marvel Comics. The Iron Spider armor also has a secret override that can be activated by Iron Man in case of emergencies or if Spider-Man ever switches sides. However, unknown to Stark, Peter was already aware of the safety measure and had bypassed it with his own override, Passcode Surprise. Perhaps most sinister, Stark discovered a way to give his own Iron Man armor a \\"spider-sense\\" based on Peter's, and the ability to give Spider-Man's sense red herrings.The Amazing Spider-Man #536. Marvel Comics. Other versions In the pages of Contest of Champions, a variation of Natasha Romanov donned the Iron Spider identity in an unidentified alternate reality where Iron Man used the Reality Gem to rig the Civil War in his favor where he later became President of the United States. She inherited it after Peter defected to Captain America's side and later became a member of the Civil Warriors.Contest of Champions (2015) #9-10. Marvel Comics. In other media Television *The Iron Spider armor appears in the Ultimate Spider-Man animated series. This version includes repulsors on the palms and feet, similar to those of Iron Man. It is initially used by Peter Parker in the episodes \\"Flight of Iron Spider\\", \\"The Iron Octopus\\" and \\"Venom Bomb\\". Subsequent seasons depict the armor in the hands of Amadeus Cho under the Iron Spider mantle. Additionally the episode \\"Rampaging Rhino\\" features a variant Iron Spider Hulkbuster created by Curt Connors at the time when the Hulk fights with the Rhino. * Amadeus Cho's Iron Spider appearance appears in Lego Marvel Super Heroes: Avengers Reassembled. Film * The Iron Spider armor is featured in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as an armored suit designed by Tony Stark for Peter Parker. It makes its first appearance at the end of Spider-Man: Homecoming, when Stark offers Peter membership in the Avengers, though Peter declines both. The suit's appearance has a far more \\"classic\\" look than that of the comics, with dark red and blue tones throughout, as well as gold highlights. * The armor returns in Avengers: Infinity War (2018), when Iron Man uses it to save Peter after he falls from Ebony Maw's Q-ship, high above the Earth's surface. Peter uses the suit for the rest of the film, although it is destroyed along with Peter himself when he is part of the 50% of all life to be culled after Thanos's plan succeeds. The armor uses nanotechnology that also characterizes Iron Man's armor in the film, and allows Spider-Man to survive at high altitude and on Thanos' homeworld Titan (which has low gravity levels as well). As in the comics, the armor features a set of four mechanical legs that sprout from the back of the costume, which Spider-Man uses in combat and enhances his mobility and agility. * The armor once again returns in Avengers: Endgame (2019) when Parker and other heroes who died are resurrected for the final battle on Earth against Thanos. * Peter continues to use the Iron Spider armor in the opening of Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), however it is left in a nanotechnology housing unit once he leaves for his trip. Video games * The Wii version of Spider-Man: Web of Shadows features the Iron Spider outfit as an unlockable costume. * The video game Marvel Ultimate Alliance features this costume as one of Peter Parker's three alternate costumes, other two alternates being a black symbiote suit and the classic version of Scarlet Spider. * The video game Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 features this costume as Peter Parker's only alternate costume. This time, it includes the waldoes, but they are purely aesthetic with no effect on gameplay. This costume can only be unlocked by choosing Pro-Registration. * The video games Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions and Spider-Man: Edge of Time also feature the Iron Spider armor as an alternate suit for Spider-Man 2099. * The Iron Spider armor appears as one of Spider-Man's alternate costumes in Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds. * The video game Marvel: Avengers Alliance features the Iron Spider costume as Spider-Man's final costume. However, it does not feature the waldoes. * The Iron Spider suit is referenced in Lego Marvel Super Heroes during a conversation between Spider-Man and Iron Man. During their infiltration in an A.I.M. submarine, Iron Man says \\"You know, I could fit you with a rocket- propelled iron suit if you'd like.\\" and Spider-Man replies \\"sounds heavy.\\" * Amadeus Cho's Iron Spider form appears in Lego Marvel's Avengers, as DLC. * Mary Jane Watson's Iron Spider form appears in Marvel Avengers Academy. * The Iron Spider appears as one of Spider-Man's alternate costumes in Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite if Spider-Man's wearing the Superior Spider-Man outfit. * The MCU Iron Spider armor appears as one of Spider-Man's alternate costumes as an unlockable (with early access as a pre-order bonus) in the 2018 Spider-Man video game. Unlocking it allows the use of the waldoes (called \\"Iron Arms\\" in the game) with any suit, giving Spider-Man a temporary boost to reach and damage during melee combat. A second version of the suit, more accurate to the original comics, was later released as part of the \\"Turf Wars\\" DLC. When Spider-Man wore the classic Iron Spider, the waldoes' color will be all gold, much like in the comic.

Indigenous Roman Catholic Greeks number about 50,000-70,000 and are a religious and not an ethnic minority. Most of them are a reminiscence of Venetian and Genoese rule in southern Greece and many Greek islands (in both the Aegean and Ionian seas) from the early 13th until the late 18th century, Greeks who converted to Catholicism or descendants of the thousands of Bavarians that came to Greece in the 1830s as soldiers and civil administrators, accompanying King Otto. One very old but still common term to reference to them is Œ¶œÅŒ¨Œ≥Œ∫ŒøŒπ, or \\"Franks\\", dating to the times of the Byzantine Empire, when medieval Greeks would use that term to describe all Catholics. Since the early 1990s however, the number of Catholic permanent residents of Greece has greatly increased; today, they number 200,000 at the very least, and probably more. These Catholics are immigrants from Eastern Europe (especially Poland) or from the Philippines, but also include Western European expatriates that live permanently in Athens, Thessaloniki or the Greek islands (especially Crete, Syros, Rhodes and Corfu). Today, the majority of Catholics live in Athens, a city of about four million people; the rest of them can be found all over Greece. Most indigenous Catholics live in the islands, and especially the Cyclades, where Syros and Tinos in particular have some entirely Catholic villages and parishes. Catholics can be found also in Corfu, Naxos, Santorini, Kefalonia, Zakynthos, Rhodes, Kos, Crete, Samos, Lesbos and Chios. In the mainland, Catholic communities are smaller, and include those of Patras (a city that was home to a large Italian community until World War II), Thessaloniki, Kavala, Volos etc. In addition to the Roman Catholics (Latin Rite) who represent the vast majority of the faithful, there are about 5,000 of the Greek Rite, and a few hundred Armenian Catholics. History Before the division of the church in 1054, there were structures of the Western Latin Rite Church in Greece. Since the 5th century, the Latin archbishop of Thessalonica led the Illyrian Vicariate of the Roman Church. Until 1054, there was mutual recognition between the Latin and Byzantine rite communities in Greece. After the separation of churches in 1054, a split occurred between these communities. After the church split and the conquest of Greece, the Ottoman Empire, the Greek Catholics began to be called \\"Franks\\" (Greek Œ¶œÅŒ¨Œ≥Œ∫ŒøŒπ). This name of local Catholics came from the Latin faith professed by the Franks. Orthodox Greeks, distinguishing themselves from the Franks, called themselves the \\"Romans\\" (Greek Œ°œâŒºŒ±ŒπŒøŒπ), identifying themselves with the Byzantine Empire, which considered itself the successor to the Roman Empire. After the Fourth Crusade in 1204, the residence of the Latin patriarch with 12 dioceses subordinate to him was established in Constantinople. In 1205, Pope Innocent III established the Latin Archdiocese in Athens. Other Latin church structures were established at the same time. In Greece, various Western monastic orders also operated. After the conquest of Byzantium by the Ottoman Empire in 1453 in Greece, the activity of the Latin structures gradually ceased and the dioceses of the Latin rite became titular. At the same time, until the 18th century, there were numerous Venetian colonies in Greece, which possessed considerable freedom. In 1830, a gradual restoration of Latin church structures began in Greece. That year, Pope Gregory XVI established the first church structure for Catholics of the Latin rite, which was called the apostolic delegate. In 1834, Bishop Blancis was appointed apostolic delegate and the Holy See entrusted him with the care of Latin Catholics living in Greece. On July 23, 1875, Pope Pius IX established the archdiocese of Athens and the Peloponnese. In 1856, a community of Greek Eastern Catholics was formed in Constantinople, which became the basis of the Greek Catholic Church. In 1979, the Holy See established diplomatic relations with Greece.

Their terms of service described liberal usage policies for home users allowing subscribers to run any number of servers and allowing them to resell their connectivity to others through a service called \\"NetShare\\". They received press coverage for their support of Linux and BSD-derivative operating systems, and were reportedly the first provider to offer a customized version of Mozilla Firefox to customers, in January 2005. The company is now part of MegaPath Corporation. History In 1994, Gretchen Apgar and husband Mike opened a cybercafe in Seattle's Belltown neighborhood with Mike's brother Tyler. They started out with offering connectivity and email services in the area. Customers at the cafe expressed a wish to have the ability to check their email from other locations than just the cafe and a series of terminal stations were set up at various bars around town. These terminals were marketed under the label, \\"Rainmail.\\" As computing power expanded and the cost of computers diminished, customers began to express the further wish to access their email from home. Speakeasy put together a bank of modems and offered a dial up service. As of 2008, dialup through Speakeasy is still available for $19 a month. The move toward DSL took place in 1998. In late 1999, the company expanded to a national level, offering DSL services throughout the United States. The Speakeasy backbone consisted of a dedicated fiber ring that circled the continental United States with major points of presence (i.e. POPs) in Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Dallas, Atlanta, Washington D.C., New York, and Chicago. From the POP to the customers premises a third party vendor was contracted to provide data layer connectivity. This is known in networking as the 'last mile'. In the case of Speakeasy, the data-link protocol used was ATM rather than PPPoE or Frame Relay in case of T1's. In 2001, in the face of the collapse of many ISPs as a possible result of the dot-com bust, Speakeasy had marketed a program to allow for simple transfer of accounts, starting with the announcement of the failure of Flashcom, a former DSL internet provider. That same year, the cybercafe burned down in an electrical fire, forcing the company to focus on the internet business. In September 2003, Bruce Chatterley was made CEO of the company. In summer of 2004, the company announced simultaneously their entry into VOIP, and their Onelink package, which allowed a DSL subscriber to maintain an ADSL line without the requirement of a telco line. In spring of 2006 Mike Apgar stepped down as chairman and moved on to a startup company Ookla that he created while at Speakeasy. On March 27, 2007 press releases by both companies announced the acquisition of Speakeasy by Best Buy, a Fortune 100 retail chain operating in the US, Canada and China. Best Buy planned to offer Speakeasy broadband and VOIP services to small businesses through their Best Buy for Business unit. On June 10, 2010 Best Buy announced it was reducing its stake in Speakeasy, which would be merging with Covad Communications and MegaPath Corporation to form a new joint company. On September 1, 2010, MegaPath, Covad, and Speakeasy announced regulatory approval and the completion of their merger. The new combined company took the name MegaPath Corporation. On December 31, 2014, MegaPath Corporation sold certain of its network assets and direct internet access customers to GC Pivotal LLC dba Global Capacity, in order to raise cash to invest in its wholesale and managed services business.

Amateur career Born in Annapolis, Maryland and raised in Severna Park, Maryland, Floyd attended Mount Saint Joseph High School in Baltimore, Maryland, alongside fellow major leaguer Mark Teixeira, who grew up on adjacent streets. Teixeira, who is three years older than Floyd, was also selected in the first round of the 2001 MLB Draft. Professional career Draft and minor leagues The Philadelphia Phillies selected Floyd out of high school with the fourth overall selection of the 2001 draft. Floyd, who had originally made a verbal commitment to attend the University of South Carolina, opted instead to play in major league baseball. In his first professional season (2002), Floyd pitched for the Class A Lakewood BlueClaws of the South Atlantic League (SAL). A highlight of his impressive first year (2.77 ERA, .200 BAA) was pitching the first nine-inning no-hitter in BlueClaws history on July 24 against the Lexington Legends. However, Floyd actually lost the game, 1‚Äì0, due to a pair of sixth-inning errors, making him the first SAL pitcher since 1966 to lose a no-hitter. In 2004, Floyd was a non-roster invitee to spring training. He began the season with the Reading Phillies (AA) and did not allow any runs in his first 4 starts, allowing only 1 runner to make it past 2nd base. He was named the Phillies farm system Minor League Pitcher of the Week, as well as Phillies Minor League Pitcher of the Month for April (2‚Äì0, 0.00 ERA). He was promoted to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons (AAA) in July and made 5 starts before having his contract purchased by Phillies as a September callup. Philadelphia Phillies Floyd made his Major League debut September 3, 2004, against the division rival New York Mets and earned the win pitching seven innings and allowing only one run on four hits, striking out five. In 2005, Floyd made the team out of spring training and pitched strongly against the St. Louis Cardinals lineup, but struggled thereafter and was demoted to the minors, where he continued to struggle for the 2005 season. He came to 2006 spring training with barely a consideration and pitched his way into the Phillies rotation as the #4 pitcher, pushing Ryan Franklin to the bullpen. However, once again Floyd struggled, with a 4‚Äì3 record and a 7.29 ERA, and on June 2, was demoted to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre for the second straight year. Chicago White Sox Floyd in 2008 On December 6, 2006, Floyd was traded with Gio Gonz√°lez to the Chicago White Sox for Freddy Garc√≠a. Floyd was expected to be handed the spot vacated by Garcia. However, since he pitched poorly during spring training, Floyd lost the spot and was optioned to Triple-A Charlotte. On July 5, 2007, Floyd was recalled from Triple-A Charlotte by the White Sox. A day later, he pitched his first start as a South Sider in the second game of a doubleheader against Matt Garza of the Minnesota Twins, earning the loss and yielding 6 runs in 6 innings of work; the White Sox would eventually be blown out of the game, losing 12‚Äì0 to the rival Minnesota Twins. In 2008, Floyd emerged as a legitimate and solid starting pitcher at the back end of the White Sox rotation. Showing flashes of brilliance, he carried near-no-hitters against visiting Detroit (April 12) and Minnesota (May 6) into the eighth and ninth innings, respectively, and also retired 12 consecutive Baltimore Orioles to start an eventual 6‚Äì5 extra inning loss in Baltimore on April 17. He finished the regular season with a 17‚Äì8 record, with his final win coming in a game in which the White Sox beat the Detroit Tigers to force a one-game playoff with the Twins to determine the Central's winner. During 2008 he led the majors in stolen bases allowed, with 37 ‚Äì 9 more than the next closest pitcher. Floyd re-signed with the White Sox on March 22, 2009; his 4-year contract was worth $15.5 million. During the 2009 season, Floyd started 30 games, posting an 11‚Äì11 record and an ERA of 4.06, while cutting the number of stolen bases he allowed to 14. Floyd only started 5 games with a 0-4 record and an ERA of 5.18 during the 2013 season. On April 28, 2013, Floyd was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to elbow soreness. After an MRI revealed that the elbow had a torn flexor muscle and UCL. Floyd underwent Tommy John surgery on May 7, 2013 and was shut down for the rest of the 2013 season. The surgery required from 12‚Äì14 months to fully recover. Atlanta Braves Floyd became a free agent at the end of the 2013 season, and he signed a $4 million contract with the Atlanta Braves on December 16, 2013. In June 2014 Floyd suffered a fractured olecranon, missing the rest of the season. Alex Wood replaced Floyd in the rotation. Cleveland Indians Floyd signed a one-year deal with the Cleveland Indians on December 16, 2014, but was subsequently placed on the 60-day disabled list on April 5, 2015 after injuring his pitching elbow during spring training. Floyd made his Indians debut on September 2, 2015, pitching a single inning of relief. Toronto Blue Jays On February 6, 2016, Floyd signed a one-year, $1 million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. Floyd entered spring training in competition for the fifth starter role with Aaron Sanchez, Drew Hutchison, and Jesse Chavez. On March 28, it was announced that Sanchez would be the team's fifth starter, and Floyd would begin the season in the bullpen. Floyd left a game against the White Sox on June 25 with a shoulder injury, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list after the game. On June 28, it was determined that he had torn his right lat muscle and would miss 8‚Äì12 weeks recovering. Floyd remained on the disabled list for the rest of the 2016 season. He finished the season with a 2‚Äì4 record, 4.06 ERA, and 30 strikeouts in 31 innings pitched. On January 5, 2017, Floyd signed a minor league contract with the Blue Jays that included an invitation to spring training. He did not appear in any spring training games, and was released on April 5. Pitching style Floyd throws five pitches, leading with a four-seam fastball at 90‚Äì93 mph. He also throws a two-seam fastball (90‚Äì93), a slider (85‚Äì87), a curveball (79‚Äì81), and a changeup to left-handed hitters (mid 80s). His curve is a favored option with 2 strikes.

The Forges de Syam (Syam Forges) are forge works and sheet metal mills at the confluence of the rivers Ain and Saine to the south of Champagnole in the French d√©partement of Jura. History of the site The forges were still active in 2005, and still used some machinery from the 19th century, when the buildings were erected. A tilt hammer mentioned 1757 and 1788 has been working as early as 1763, according to the record of a law case of 1763. It is reasonable to imagine it as part of the region's expansion in the metal-working industry in the 16th century, after establishment of the first smelting furnaces in the Sa√¥ne valley. The basic business was making scythes. These had a good reputation, and the making of them was a finely honed skill. In the 18th century, only a few forges had mastered the technique of using a mechanical hammer. So much was this a problem that French producers couldn't keep up with demand for scythes. They were imported, particularly from Styria, in the south-east of modern Austria, beyond the Tyrol. It was possible to develop this very skilled craft in the Jura owing to the expertise of immigrant workers from the Tyrol (just beyond the far end of Switzerland). In conjunction with this skill, extensive woodland on the Jura mountains around the town provided the raw material for charcoal, a form of carbon free of sulphur and other impurities that make most coal unsuitable for iron working. Extensive woodland was an asset, as it takes many trees to make a relatively small amount of iron goods. In 1763, the owners, the P√©ry family, produced more than 15,000 scythes and more than 60,000 iron tires for the wheels of vehicles. Nineteenth century After the French Revolution, the production of good-quality scythes provided an important opportunity for investment. Other industrialists of the Jura, of the Vosges and Alsace began production, contributing to Charles-Joseph P√©ry declaring himself bankrupt on 24 July 1810. The unit was bought the same year by Claude Jobez (1745‚Äì1830), of Morez. He had already made a fortune from selling clocks from the Franche- Comt√© region in Paris, and from financing several iron workshops. Also in 1810, Etienne Monnier who had married Ad√©la√Øde, the daughter of Claude Jobez in 1800, invested in the company alongside his father-in-law and the latter's son, Emmanuel. Between 1811 and 1820, they built a new factory downstream from the primitive tilt hammer. This included a novelty for France at the time, a reverberatory furnace. From 1820, these works produced 400 tons of goods each year, which doubled by 1840. Competition from coke-smelted cast iron from the United Kingdom‚Äîwhich was cheaper than charcoal-produced iron goods at Syam‚Äîhurt the business. Alphonse Jobez, the son of Emmanuel, set up a nail works in 1864, which gave new life to an enterprise that had neared collapse. The workforce increased from 40 to 70. =Social and domestic life= From 1825, Emmanuel Jobez developed the project of building a Palladian villa, the Ch√¢teau de Syam to replace the old house beside the original forge. He didn't see its completion, having died by accident in 1828. Alphonse, his son, took up the cause of Fourierist theory. He applied it at Syam by creating a cit√© ouvri√®re (compare Saltaire), adjoining the factory, encouraging the setting up of a school and a dispensary. He added a post office with telegraph in 1885. In parallel to this, he introduced exotic livestock to the estate farm and other lands he owned. A cultivated man, Alphonse also fitted out a library of 30,000 volumes on the first floor (American second floor) of the villa. Alphonse's granddaughter, who had married the son of Sadi-Carnot in 1910, would often stay at Syam. Twentieth century The nail works closed in 1914. Syam limited its range of products, specializing in those where there was limited competition. This enabled it to survive the two World Wars. In 1945, the firm of UMAS, from Arc-et-Senans, a specialist in making files, became the main stakeholder in Syam. The group went bankrupt in 1976. From 1969, a workforce would come from Morocco, from the village of El Hajjyenne. In 1976, the forges were sold to Experton-Revollier, a group from Is√®re. Modernization was necessary, as there was no travelling crane or electric motor-driven machinery (instead of belt transmission). Improvements went hand in hand with the retention of the steel rolling mill, the last of its type in France and one of the last in Europe.  Present-day activity  Today, this remnant of the iron industry of the 19th century feeds the market in short-run products, particularly in the fields of locksmiths' work, motor cars and lifts (elevators).

Known for her junoesque body and voluptuous measurements, she was considered one of the main pin-up girls of Italy. Some films credited her as Vanessa Steiger. Horror film buffs know her for her two gory opuses, Antropophagus (1980) and Delirium (1987). Biography Serena Grandi is the stage name for Serena Faggioli, born in Bologna. She graduated in computer programming and was first employed in a scientific analysis laboratory. She started her acting career in 1980, playing a supporting role in the comedy film La Compagna di viaggio by Ferdinando Baldi. In the same year, Grandi played the role of Maggie in the controversial film Antropophagus, directed by Joe D'Amato. This film is well known among horror movie fans for its extreme gore sequences. After several minor roles, she took the title role in Tinto Brass' Miranda, which gave her the status of sex symbol in her native Italy and set the path for her stardom. Through the 1980s, Grandi made nearly 20 films, mainly appearing in \\"Commedie sexy all'italiana\\" and erotic films, but also starring in sword epics such as The Adventures of Hercules and in some horror films. In 1987 Lamberto Bava gave her the role of Gloria in his film Delirium. In 1991 she married the antiquarian Beppe Ercole, 20 years her senior, with whom she had a son Edoardo; the couple divorced in 1998. In the 1990s, Grandi started to back away from the spotlight; during this time she focused her career on television series. In 2003-2004 Grandi spent 157 days under house arrest, accused of having sold a few grams of cocaine. The case was later dismissed. In 2006, Grandi was a candidate in the list of Azione Sociale, a right-leaning party led by Alessandra Mussolini, but she was not elected. The same year she published her first novel, L‚Äôamante del federale. In 2008, after a break of ten years, she returned to acting. In 2017 Grandi competed in Grande Fratello VIP, the italian adaptation of Celebrity Big Brother.

The VVB claims to be completely independent, although several politicians can be found among the members. In 1956, the VVB was founded by Maurits Coppieters, a notorious politician and anti-fascist Flemish nationalist. In the beginning, the VVB opposed Belgian unitarism by demanding Flemish autonomy and suggesting the introduction of federalism. The conservative politician Wilfried Martens - and later Belgian Prime Minister and EPP Chairman - even announced constitutional reform on a VVB-congress in 1962. Since 1991, the VVB no longer supports further federalisation of the Belgian state and stands for complete Flemish independence. Within the Flemish Movement, the VVB represents the more radical flamingants. The VVB was founder of the monthly magazine Grondvest about Flanders and the Flemish movement. The VVB also distributes two newsletters Kaderblad ('Board Paper') and Nederlands Landstaal ('Dutch Language of the State'). The VVB celebrated its 50th year of existence in 2006 and changed its motto from Vlaanderen staat in Europa (meaning both:'Flanders stands in Europe' and 'Flanders, state in Europe') into Wij gaan verder ('We Go Further'). In 2013 the VVB launched a campaign Ja voor Vlaanderen (Yes for Flanders). In 2014 the VVB organised an international manifestation in Brussels in collaboration with its European partners of EPI (European Partnership for Independence) en ICEC (International Commission of European Citizens). The VVB is composed out of more than 100 regional committees and its membership exceeded 5,000 by early 2015. Since 2013, the VVB is chaired by Bart De Valck.

It was the first game released by Thalamus. Fasoulas also wrote Delta and Quedex. Gameplay Sanxion is a horizontally-scrolling shooter. The goal to traverse each level from left to right avoiding or destroying any enemies and obstacles. The side-scroller speed is controllable, increasing the closer the player is to the center of the screen. The screen is divided in two sections, the upper one with an overhead view, and the lower one, taking up two-thirds of the screen, shows a typical side view. Enemies can come from both sides of the screen in close formations that the player must avoid colliding with. While the scrolling is automatic for the most part, the player can control the speed of the engines (there is even a bonus timer that counts down, as an incentive for those who want to \\"blast through\\"), and the pitch of the noise alters accordingly, while sounding vaguely like a didgeridoo. This \\"adjustable rate autoscroll\\" is uncommon in the genre (Armed Police Unit Gallop is another example of this). There are a few exceptions, though. Several levels end with sections where the ship is forced to fly at maximum speed (a two-note siren will sound at the beginning of such sections), where the player must be quick to avoid oncoming barriers. There are two main types of levels in Sanxion, based on the enemies. In some, such as the first, the enemies are constant throughout the level. In some others, such as the second, reaching a certain point (usually change of terrain) will cause all enemies on screen to self-destruct, and a different type of enemy will appear. There are exceptions to these patterns. At the end of each level, there are non-lethal bonus stages which award points to the player for shooting, crashing or avoiding floating letters (the action required depends on the actual letter) at great speed. The background in these stages is a rainbow, and the \\"radar\\" does not show your ship. Music The SID music by Rob Hubbard called \\"Thalamusik\\" was played in the Commodore 64 tape loading screen, during several minutes of slow tape load. The piece was inspired by Zoolook by Jean Michel Jarre, a piece that Hubbard also reproduced in SID form for some public domain demos.http://www.c64.com/interviews/hubbard_part_2.html It was very popular and later spawned several fan-made remixes.http://www.remix64.com/tune_47500.html The menu plays a SID version of Sergei Prokofiev's Dance of the Knights piece from the ballet Romeo and Juliet. Ports Sinclair ZX Spectrum Sanxion was ported externally to the Sinclair ZX Spectrum by Sofstorm Developments in 1989 with the subtitle the Spectrum Remix in both 48k and 128k versions. This port has noticeable gameplay differences, e.g. the scrolling speed is fixed. The music score features renditions of the two main themes composed by Wally Beben. Game Boy Advance A port was planned by Thalamus Interactive in 2001 for the Game Boy Advance, with updated graphics and new features, like two-player mode and end-of-level bosses. A prototype without a split screen was developed, but the game was perceived too financially risky and ultimately canceled. \\"Games that weren't\\", Retrogamer, Issue 18, p.71 Development Sanxion was the first Thalamus game to use the Cyberload loader by John Twiddy, famous for containing the string \\"hackers fuck off and die\\".C64.COM - For the best in C64 nostalgia - Thalamus History :Stavros Fasoulas Computer Gaming World noted the presence of the fastloader (although not the string present) and was very thankful for its inclusion. Reception The game was reviewed in 1988 in Dragon #130 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. Commodore User's Mike Pattenden considered the game to be a clone of Uridium which was well executed but not really worth purchasing as an alternative to the cheaper rival Warhawk.http://amr.abime.net/issue_2365_reviews It was voted Best Soundtrack of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards.http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue066/Pages/CVG06600101.jpg In a retrospective review Kristan Reed of Eurogamer gave the game a 7/10 rating and said \\"Although Sanxion doesn't stand up nearly as well as Uridium does these days, it was still a real highlight of the C64's growing love- affair with shooters.

He was born on Tuesday, December 30, 1930 in Jefferson Center, Pennsylvania. He was listed at a height of and a weight of 158 pounds. Graff attended Butler Senior High School and then attended Pennsylvania State University and Lycoming College. At Lycoming, he got a degree in accounting. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. Playing career Around 1949, Graff was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates as an amateur free agent. Around eight years later, during which his baseball career was interrupted when he enlisted in the Army to fight in the Korean War, Graff made his major league debut on April 16, 1957 at the age of 26 with the Kansas City Athletics (he was sent to the Athletics from the New York Yankees, by whom he'd been drafted in 1955). He wore the number 4. In 61 major league games, Graff batted .179 with 4 doubles, 3 triples and 0 home runs. He showed a good eye at the plate by walking 15 times and striking out only 10 times. In the field, Graff committed 3 errors for a .988 fielding percentage. He also was involved in 36 double plays. Graff played his final game on September 21, 1958. Blockbuster transaction *On February 19, 1957, the New York Yankees sent Graff, Rip Coleman, Billy Hunter, Mickey McDermott, Tom Morgan and Irv Noren to the Kansas City Athletics for Art Ditmar, Bobby Shantz, Jack McMahan and Wayne Belardi. As players to be named, the Yankees sent Jack Urban to the Athletics and the Athletics sent Curt Roberts and Clete Boyer to the Yankees to complete the trade.

The Parable of the Leaven (also called the Parable of the yeast) is one of the shortest parables of Jesus. It appears in Matthew () and Luke (), as well as in the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas (logion 96). In the canonicals it immediately follows the Parable of the Mustard Seed, which shares this parable's theme of the Kingdom of Heaven growing from small beginnings, and in the Gospel of Thomas it starts a series of three, preceding the Parable of the empty jar and the Parable of the Strong Man. Narrative The parable describes what happens when a woman adds leaven (old, fermented doughI. Howard Marshall 1978, The Gospel of Luke: A commentary on the Greek text, Eerdmans, , pp. 561‚Äì62. usually containing lactobacillus and yeast) to a large quantity of flour (about gallons or 38 litresJohn Nolland 2005, The Gospel of Matthew: A commentary on the Greek text, Eerdmans, , pp. 553‚Äì54.). The living organisms in the leaven grow overnight, so that by morning the entire quantity of dough has been affected. In the Gospel of Luke, the parable is as follows: Interpretation This parable is part of a pair,Ben Witherington III 1987, Women in the Ministry of Jesus: A study of Jesus' attitudes to women and their roles as reflected in his earthly life, Cambridge University Press, , pp. 40‚Äì41. and shares the meaning of the preceding Parable of the Mustard Seed, namely the powerful growth of the Kingdom of God from small beginnings. The final outcome is inevitable once the natural process of growth has begun.Adolf J√ºlicher identifies three parts to a parable or similitude (extended simile or metaphor): a picture part (Bildh√§lfte), a reality part (Sachh√§lfte), and a tertium comparationis.Adolf J√ºlicher 1910, Die Gleichnisreden Jesu, 2nd ed. (T√ºbingen: J. C. B. Mohr); James L. Resseguie 2005, Narrative Criticism of the New Testament: An Introduction, Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 63‚Äì64. The picture part is a woman making bread with leaven, the reality part is the kingdom of God, and the point of comparison is the powerful growth of the kingdom from small beginnings. Although leaven symbolises evil influences elsewhere in the New Testament (as in Luke ), it is not generally interpreted that way in this parable.John Calvin, Commentary on Matthew, Mark, Luke, Volume 2.Daniel J. Harrington 1991, The Gospel of Matthew, Liturgical Press, , p. 205. However, a few commentators do see the leaven as reflecting future corrupting influences in the Church.Herbert Lockyer 1988, All the Parables of the Bible, Zondervan, , p. 190.G. H. Pember 1881, The great prophecies, Hodder & Stoughton, p. 253. As with the Parable of the Lost Coin, this parable is part of a pair, in which the first parable describes Jesus' work in terms of agricultural activities of men compared to the second parable with a focus on women's domestic activities. Joel B. Green writes that Jesus \\"asks people‚Äîmale or female, privileged or peasant, it does not matter‚Äîto enter the domain of a first-century woman and household cook in order to gain perspective on the domain of God.\\"Joel B. Green 1997, The Gospel of Luke, Eerdmans, , p. 527. The large quantity of flour may hint at a planned festive occasion, since the bread produced could feed a hundred people. Three measures of meal was the amount used by Sarah to bake bread when she and Abram were visited by Melchizedek and the angels. It is also the amount used in baking the shewbread for the Temple of the Lord in Israel. Both trees (mustard or otherwise) and leavened bread possess a fractal structure visible to the naked eye.

The eponymous memorial, dedicated in July of 1998 by the African American Civil War Memorial Freedom Foundation, commemorates the service of 209,145 African-American soldiers and about 7,000 white and 2,145 Hispanic soldiers, together with the approximate 20,000 unsegregated Navy sailors, who fought for the Union in the American Civil War, mostly among the 175 regiments of United States Colored Troops. The Memorial is at the corner of Vermont Avenue, 10th Street, and U Street NW in Washington, D.C. It holds a 9-foot bronze statue, The Spirit of Freedom, by Ed Hamilton of Louisville, Kentucky, commissioned by the DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities in 1993 and completed in 1997. The memorial includes a walking area with curved panel short walls inscribed with the names of the men who served in the war. The Museum is across the street from the Memorial, at 1925 Vermont Ave. NW. Plans are in place for it to move into the former Grimk√© School, at 1923 Vermont Ave. NW. As of 2018 the Museum is housed in the former gymnasium of the school, which was converted into an office building in the 1980s.

It was transferred to the National Park Service (NPS) on October 27, 2004. The National Mall and Memorial Parks office of the NPS now manages the site. The museum The African American Civil War Museum is located directly across from the memorial at 1925 Vermont Avenue. From July 16‚Äì18, 2011, it celebrated its grand opening in a new facility, with a weekend of speakers and events devoted to racial reconciliation.African American Civil War Memorial and Museum, Official Website, 2011, accessed 21 July 2011 It planned four years of activities to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the war and African-American contributions. The museum opened in January 1999 in a building two blocks west of the memorial in the historic U Street Corridor, a neighborhood traditionally the heart of African-American entertainment and theater in Washington. The museum enables visitors, researchers, and descendants of the United States Colored Troops to better understand their stories. It displays photographs, newspaper articles, and replicas of period clothing, and uniforms and weaponry of the Civil War. The African American Civil War Memorial Registry at the museum documents the family trees of more than 2,000 descendants of those men who served with the USCT. Other descendants may register. Visitors can easily search the database to find ancestors and relatives registered in the Descendants Registry. Notable people A WMATA metro station near the memorial A number of men have had their service and lives noted. Among the near 220,000 names here are some whose service and lives have been documented. Many earned a Medal of Honor, the highest and most prestigious personal military decoration that may be awarded to recognize U.S. military service members who distinguished themselves by acts of valor, during their service in a black regiment during the war. Additionally many earned a brevet promotion which was a warrant giving a commissioned officer a higher rank title as a reward for gallantry or meritorious conduct, but without conferring the authority, precedence, or pay of real rank. * George E.

Marketers may use personas together with market segmentation, where the qualitative personas are constructed to be representative of specific segments. The term persona is used widely in online and technology applications as well as in advertising, where other terms such as pen portraits may also be used. Personas are useful in considering the goals, desires, and limitations of brand buyers and users in order to help to guide decisions about a service, product or interaction space such as features, interactions, and visual design of a website. Personas may also be used as part of a user-centered design process for designing software and are also considered a part of interaction design (IxD), having been used in industrial design and more recently for online marketing purposes. A user persona is a representation of the goals and behavior of a hypothesized group of users. In most cases, personas are synthesized from data collected from interviews with users.Humphrey, Aaron (2017), ,Persona Studies Vol. 3, No. 2, pp. 13-20. They are captured in 1‚Äì2-page descriptions that include behavioral patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, with a few fictional personal details to make the persona a realistic character. In addition to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), personas are also widely used in sales, advertising, marketing and system design. Personas provide common behaviors, outlooks, and potential objections of people matching a given persona. History Within software design, Alan Cooper, a noted pioneer software developer, proposed the concept of a user persona. Beginning in 1983, he started using a prototype of what the persona would become using data from informal interviews with seven to eight users. From 1995, he became engaged with how a specific rather than generalized user would use and interface with the software. The technique was popularized for the online business and technology community in his 1999 book The Inmates are Running the Asylum. In this book, Cooper outlines the general characteristics, uses and best practices for creating personas, recommending that software be designed for single archetypal users. The concept of understanding customer segments as communities with coherent identity was developed in 1993-4 by Angus JenkinsonJenkinson, A. (1994) ‚ÄòBeyond segmentation‚Äô, Journal of Targeting, Measurement and Analysis for Marketing, Vol. 3, No. 1, pp. 60‚Äì72Jenkinson, A.

Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke UK Creating imaginal or fictional characters to represent these customer segments or communities followed. Jenkinson's approach was to describe an imaginal character in their real interface, behavior and attitudes with the brand, and the idea was initially realized with Michael Jacobs in a series of studies. In 1997 the Ogilvy global knowledge management system, Truffles, described the concept as follows: \\"Each strong brand has a tribe of people who share affinity with the brand‚Äôs values. This universe typically divides into a number of different communities within which there are the same or very similar buying behaviours, and whose personality and characteristics towards the brand (product or service) can be understood in terms of common values, attitudes and assumptions. CustomerPrints are descriptions that capture the living essence of these distinct groups of customers.\\"Jenkinson, A (1997) CustomerPrints: Defining the Essentials of the Consumer: The essential guide to what CustomerPrints are, why and how to do them and even how to use them.

OgilvyOne Cooper a user experience design and strategy consulting firm founded by Sue Cooper and Alan Cooper in 1992 in Menlo Park, CA, under the name 'Cooper Software,' then changing the name to 'Cooper Interaction Design' in 1997. Cooper was the first consulting firm dedicated solely to interaction design. Its original clients were mainly Silicon Valley software and computer hardware companies. The company uses a human-centered methodology called ‚Äúgoal-directed design‚Äù that emphasizes the importance of understanding the user's desired end-state and their motivations for getting there. In 2002, Cooper began offering training classes to the public including topic as interaction design, service design, visual design, and design leadership. Cooper has served as the President of Cooper (formerly Cooper Interaction Design), a user experience and interaction design consultancy in San Francisco, California since its founding in 1992. Cooper helps their customers with interaction design challenges and offers training courses in software design and development topics, including their Goal-Directed design (under the CooperU brand). In 2017, Cooper became part of Designit, a strategic design arm of Wipro Digital. Benefits According to Pruitt and Adlin, the use of personas offers several benefits in product development.Pruitt, John & Adlin, Tamara. The Persona Lifecycle: Keeping People in Mind Throughout Product Design. Morgan Kaufmann, 2006. cf. ; . Personas are said to be cognitively compelling because they put a personal human face on otherwise abstract data about customers. By thinking about the needs of a fictional persona, designers may be better able to infer what a real person might need. Such inference may assist with brainstorming, use case specification, and features definition. Pruitt and Adlin argue that personas are easy to communicate to engineering teams and thus allow engineers, developers, and others to absorb customer data in a palatable format. They present several examples of personas used for purposes of communication in various development projects. Personas also help prevent some common design pitfalls which may otherwise be easy to fall into. The first is designing for what Cooper calls \\"The Elastic User\\", by which he means that while making product decisions different stakeholders may define the 'user' according to their convenience. Defining personas helps the team have a shared understanding of the real users in terms of their goals, capabilities, and contexts. Personas also help prevent \\"self-referential design\\" when the designer or developer may unconsciously project their own mental models on the product design which may be very different from that of the target user population. Personas also provide a reality check by helping designers keep the focus of the design on cases that are most likely to be encountered for the target users and not on edge cases which usually will not happen for the target population. According to Cooper, edge cases which should naturally be handled properly should not become the design focus. The persona benefits are summarized as follows: * Help team members share a specific, consistent understanding of various audience groups. Data about the groups can be put in a proper context and can be understood and remembered in coherent stories. * Proposed solutions can be guided by how well they meet the needs of individual user personas. Features can be prioritized based on how well they address the needs of one or more personas. * Provide a human \\"face\\" so as to create empathy for the persons represented by the demographics.  Criticism  Criticism of personas falls into three general categories: analysis of the underlying logic, concerns about practical implementation, and empirical results.cf. ; . In terms of scientific logic, it has been argued that because personas are fictional, they have no clear relationship to real customer data and therefore cannot be considered scientific.K√∂hler, T. (2001). Methoden der Analyse computervermittelter Kommunikation: ein kritischer √úberblick; In: Frindte, W., K√∂hler, T., Marquet, P. & Nissen, E.: IN-TELE 99 - Internet-based teaching and learning 99. Peter Lang Verlag, Frankfurt am Main. Chapman and Milham described the purported flaws in considering personas as a scientific research method. They argued that there is no procedure to work reliably from given data to specific personas, and thus such a process is not subject to the scientific method of reproducible research.  Scientific research  In empirical results, the research to date has offered soft metrics for the success of personas, such as anecdotal feedback from stakeholders. R√∂nkk√∂ has described how team politics and other organizational issues led to limitations of the personas method in one set of projects. Chapman, Love, Milham, Elrif, and Alford have demonstrated with survey data that descriptions with more than a few attributes (e.g., such as a persona) are likely to describe very few if any real people. They argued that personas cannot be assumed to be descriptive of actual customers. A study conducted by Long claimed support for Cooper, Pruitt et al. in the use of personas. In a partially controlled study, a group of students were asked to solve a design brief; two groups used personas while one group did not. The students who used personas were awarded higher course evaluations than the group who did not. Students who used personas were assessed as having produced designs with better usability attributes than students who did not use personas. The study also suggests that using personas may improve communication between design teams and facilitate user-focused design discussion. The study had several limitations: outcomes were assessed by a professor and students who were not blind to the hypothesis, students were assigned to groups in a non-random fashion, the findings were not replicated, and other contributing factors or expectation effects (e.g., the Hawthorne effect or Pygmalion effect) were not controlled for.  Data-driven personas  Data-driven personas (sometimes also called quantitative personas) have been suggested by McGinn and Kotamraju. These personas are claimed to address the shortcomings of qualitative persona generation (see Criticism). Academic scholars have proposed several methods for data-driven persona development, such as clustering, factor analysis, principal component analysis, latent semantic analysis, and non-negative matrix factorization. These methods generally take numerical input data, reduce its dimensionality, and output higher level abstractions (e.g., clusters, components, factors) that describe the patterns in the data. These patterns are typically interpreted as \\"skeletal\\" personas, and enriched with personified information (e.g., name, portrait picture). Quantitative personas can also be enriched with qualitative insights to generate mixed method personas (also called hybrid personas).

It is also home to Cola P, creator of the Gobble.World Music Central: Chris Armstrong The band is currently defunct.Seafield & District Pipe Band Situated just outside Seafield is Blackburn House. This is an A-listed building built in 1772 by George Moncrieff.Cockburn Conservation Trust Seafield grew principally to provide housing for coal and oil-shale mine workers, with three poorer-quality rows north of the road demolished but two later, well-built terraces of miners' rows on the south side now restored in the centre of the village. The oil-shale works north of the village were cleared by the 1960s, leaving a large oil-shale bing (tip). The County Council then used the works site and the adjacent peat moss as its main domestic refuse tip until the 1980s. This generated serious water pollution problems, aggravated by outflow being east towards the New Town of Livingston. One of the last large-scale Scottish Enterprise-led land reclamation schemes, in the 1990s, utilised the spent shale (which is inert, having been retorted at high temperature) to blind over the tip, with full pollution control measures. Seafield Bing itself was remodelled to a design brief by West Lothian Planners, to resemble the natural basalt sills and lava flow landscapes of the Bathgate Hills and Fife, with a serrated crestline, and a proper summit now estimated at 198m asl in height, and renamed with approval of the Community Council \\"Seafield Law\\", appearing thus on latest Ordnance Survey maps.

In 1993, Leeson and David Wilson produced a documentary film featuring child victims of the war in former Yugoslavia. What they saw so deeply shocked them that they established War Child, which today is a network of independent non- governmental organisations (NGOs) operating across the world to help children affected by war. In early 1999, Leeson stepped down as CEO as a result of a disagreement about whether the charity should have accepted funds from a Bosnian contractor some years earlier. Later that year, Leeson left War Child due to irreconcilable differences with the trustee board of that time, many of whom resigned shortly thereafter. Leeson and the current War Child management and board enjoy a good relationship, with Leeson invited to advise War Child and attend its 15th anniversary celebrations for the Help CD in 2010.

Lowy, a veteran of the Israeli war of independence, and close associate of two former Israeli prime ministers, emigrated to Australia and founded Westfield Corporation, a global shopping centre company; he retains a key role in various shopping centres in Australia and New Zealand. In 2003, Lowy reportedly endowed the institute with a donation sufficient to fund the first eight years of its operation. His family continues to play a key role in the institute, with at least four \\"Lowy\\"-named people on the Board of Directors. The institute registered with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, in 2012, as the \\"Lowy Institute For International Policy,\\" and by 2019 was reporting over $12 million in revenues (including over $2 million from government), and over $9 million in expenses.\\"Lowy Institute For International Policy,\\" Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, retrieved December 26, 2019 The institute has also been funded by donations from the investment management firm, Manikay Partners; from a global accounting and professional services firm: Ernst & Young; and from a former Australian diplomat and cabinet secretary, Michael Thawley (with his wife Deborah).

AP2 was a sequel of sorts to the band Argyle Park, who released their only album Misguided in 1995. Argyle Park had consisted of Buka and Klayton, while AP2 featured primary players Buka and Level, with Klayton producing the record. In the winter of 2000, Tooth & Nail cut AP2 due to the low sales of this album. Since Buka had only wanted AP2 to release albums for Tooth & Nail, AP2 ended as a band after Tooth & Nail dropped them. Suspension of Disbelief was every bit as experimental as its precursor, including elements of gabber techno, dance-pop, drum and bass, ambient techno, R&B;, punk rock, and metal.

The Parable of the Hidden Treasure is a well known parable of Jesus, which appears in Matthew 13:44, and illustrates the great value of the Kingdom of Heaven. It immediately precedes the parable of the Pearl, which has a similar theme. The parable has been depicted by artists such as Rembrandt. Narrative The brief parable of the hidden treasure is as follows: A depiction of this parable (left) paired with that of the pearl (right) on a stained glass window in Scots' Church, Melbourne. The setting here presupposes that someone has buried a treasure and later died. The current owner of the field is unaware of its existence. The finder, perhaps a farm labourer, is entitled to it, but is unable to conveniently extract it unless he buys the field. For a peasant, such a discovery of treasure represented the \\"ultimate dream.\\"Craig S. Keener, A Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew, Eerdmans, 1999, , p. 391. Interpretation This parable is interpreted as illustrating the great value of the Kingdom of Heaven, and thus has a similar theme to the parable of the pearl. John Nolland comments that the good fortune reflected in the \\"finding\\" reflects a \\"special privilege,\\"John Nolland, The Gospel of Matthew: A commentary on the Greek text, Eerdmans, 2005, , pp. 563‚Äì65. and a source of joy, but also reflects a challenge, just as the man in the parable gives up all that he has, in order to lay claim to the greater treasure he has found. John Calvin writes of this parable: The hidden nature of the treasure may indicate that the Kingdom of Heaven \\"is not yet revealed to everyone.\\"William David Davies & Dale C. Allison, A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Gospel According to Saint Matthew: Commentary on Matthew VIII‚ÄìXVIII, Continuum, 1997, , pp. 435‚Äì37. However, other interpretations of the parable exist, in which the treasure represents Israel or the Church.Herbert Lockyer, All the Parables of the Bible, Zondervan, 1988, , pp. 197‚Äì200. Buried treasure is unearthed; a fortune is within his reach. In St. Thomas Aquinas' Catena Aurea, he compiles the comments of some of the Church Fathers on this passage, who point out that like the treasure hidden in the field, the Gospel comes without cost, and is open to all ‚Äì but to truly possess heavenly riches, one must be willing to give up the world to buy it. The Fathers also identify that the field in which the treasure is hidden is the discipline of Heavenly learning: The New Testament scholar Adolf J√ºlicher offers a deceptively simple explanation of the parable. He identifies three parts to parables or similitudes (extended similes or metaphors): the picture part (Bildh√§lfte), the reality part (Sachh√§lfte), and the point of comparison (teritium comparationis).Adolf J√ºlicher 1910, Die Gleichnisreden Jesu, 2nd ed. (T√ºbingen: J. C. B. Mohr); James L. Resseguie, Narrative Criticism of the New Testament: An Introduction, Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2005, 63‚Äì64. In this instance, the picture part is the hidden treasure, the reality part is God‚Äôs kingdom, and the point of comparison is the inestimable value of the kingdom. In light of previous parables in Matthew where God or Jesus acts on behalf of his church, Lutheran theologian David P. Scaer understands the treasure in the field to be humanity, and the one purchasing the field to be Christ. Thus, as the man in the parable sells all that he has to buy the field, so Christ gives up his life in order to redeem humanity.David P. Scaer, Discourses in Matthew: Jesus teaches the church, Concordia Publishing House, 2004, , pp. 310-315 Gospel of Thomas A similar parable also appears in the Gospel of Thomas (Saying 109):Gospel of Thomas: Lamb translation and Patterson/Meyer translation. This work's version of the parable of the Pearl appears earlier (Saying 76), rather than immediately following, as in Matthew.Brad H. Young, The Parables: Jewish Tradition and Christian Interpretation, Hendrickson Publishers, 2008, , pp. 202‚Äì206. However, the mention of a treasure in Saying 76 may reflect a source for the Gospel of Thomas in which the parables were adjacent, so that the original pair of parables has been \\"broken apart, placed in separate contexts, and expanded in a manner characteristic of folklore.\\" The multiple changes of ownership of the field are unique to the Gospel of Thomas, and reflect a different theme from the New Testament parable.

Most of the route has been made redundant by U.S. Route 7, except for the last section from Bethel to Danbury, which is part of a direct route (Route 58) from the Bridgeport area to Danbury. Route description Routes 33 and 53 Route 53 begins at US 1 in Norwalk and travels through the towns of Norwalk, Wilton, Weston, Redding, and Bethel. Route 53 ends in Downtown Danbury at a quadruple junction with Routes 37, 39, and a secondary state road leading to Interstate 84. A section in Redding, running from the Weston town line to the beginning of a brief concurrency with Route 107, is a designated state scenic road.Connecticut Scenic Roads History historic Main Street near the northern end of 53. The main road connecting the city of Norwalk to the borough of Newtown was organized as a private turnpike in May 1829. Known as the Norwalk and Newtown Turnpike, or more commonly as just the Newtown Turnpike, the road mostly used modern Route 53 from Norwalk to the Saugatuck Reservoir in Redding. Northeast of the reservoir, the old Newtown Turnpike continued the straight route using what are now town roads (Newtown Turnpike, Hopewell Woods Road, Poverty Hollow Road, and Key Rock Road) to Route 302 in the Dodgingtown section of Newtown, then Route 302 into Newtown borough. The portion of modern Route 53 between the West Redding section of Redding and Bethel center was the northern half of the Norwalk and Danbury Turnpike. This turnpike was chartered in 1795 and used part of modern US 7, modern Route 107, and Umpawaug Road to West Redding, then continued on modern Route 53. Between Redding center and West Redding, modern Route 53 was the northern half of the Northfield Turnpike, which was chartered in 1826. The southern half is now Valley Forge Road and Lyons Plains Road. In 1922, part of the Norwalk and Danbury Turnpike between West Redding and Bethel was given the designation State Highway 180 while part of the Newtown Turnpike between Redding Ridge and Newtown was assigned as State Highway 158. Route 53 was first defined in the 1932 state highway renumbering between Weston center to Georgetown along Georgetown Road (modern Route 57), then along Redding Road (Routes 107 and 53) to West Redding, then along former Highway 180 to Bethel. In 1954, the southern end was relocated and now ended at US 7 in Wilton. Route 57 took over the former Georgetown Road segment and the Newtown Turnpike became unsigned SR 725. In 1963, the southern part was relocated onto the Newtown Turnpike (former SR 725) to Weston Center, then shifted to the alignment of former Route 103 (Chestnut Hill Road/East Avenue) via Cedar Road/Norfield Road (former SR 741).

She was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature three times. Biography Born in V√•rd√∂, √Öland, Sally Salminen was the eighth child of twelve. Already as a child she entertained notions of becoming an author, but she considered herself to be too poor and unknowledgeable to succeed as a writer. After her confirmation, she worked in the village grocery store, until she moved to Stockholm, Sweden to work as a maid. During her tenure in Sweden she took correspondent courses and read books in her spare time. In 1930 Sally and her sister Aili moved to New York City, United States. While in New York, she wrote during her spare time, and it was here she started writing the manuscript for her first (and most famous) novel, Katrina. Finland-Swedish publisher Holger Schildts F√∂rlag announced in 1936 a writing contest, for which Salminen submitted her manuscript. Her submission won, and Katrina was published the same year. The novel depicts the life of an Ostrobothnian woman, Katrina, who moves to √Öland following her marriage. Katrina became an international success, eventually being translated into more than twenty languages. Sally Salminen married Danish painter Johannes D√ºrhkop in 1940, and relocated to Denmark. Salminen remained a prolific writer, but she was never able to replicate the success of her debut novel, Katrina. Besides Katrina, Prins Efflam (1953) and Vid Havet (1963) are considered her most notable works. Family Several of Salminen's siblings were notable authors in their own right. Her sister Aili Nordgren (n√©e Salminen) (1908‚Äì1995) wrote several books. Her younger brother Runar Salminen (1912‚Äì1988) released several anthologies of poetry, and elder brother Uno Salminen (1905‚Äì1991) wrote a trilogy of books about the fictional character Erik Sundblom. Additionally, Aili Nordgren's son Ralf Nordgren (1936‚Äì) and Uno Salminen's daughter Christina Remmer (1941‚Äì) have authored several books. Another notable author born on √Öland, Johannes Salminen, is however not related to Sally Salminen.

The Kingdom of Bhutan falls under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Darjeeling (India). Origins In 1627, two Portuguese Jesuits, Fathers Est√™v√£o Cacella and Jo√£o Cabral, traveling from Cochin and attempting to make a new route to the Jesuit mission in Shigatse, Tibet, visited Bhutan. While in Bhutan, these Jesuits met Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, the founder and religious leader of the Bhutanese state, and spent months in his court. The \\"Zhabdrung strongly encouraged the Jesuits to stay and even allowed them to use a room in Cheri [Monastery] as a chapel, granted them land in Paro to build a church and sent some of his own attendants to join the congregation. With no success in conversion and despite much discouragement from the Zhabdrung against their departure, the Jesuits eventually left for Tibet\\" At the end of a stay of nearly eight months in the country, Cacella wrote a long letter from Cheri Monastery to his superior in Cochin in the Malabar Coast; it was a report, the Rela√ß√£o, relating the progress of their travels. Their visit is also corroborated in contemporaneous Bhutanese sources, including the biography of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal himself.gTsang mKhan-chen ‚ÄôJam-dbyangs dPal-ldan rGyamtsho (c.1675).

Christianity was only officially allowed in 1965. The Salesians were expelled in February 1982 on disputed charges of proselytism. The only Catholic missionary allowed to stay in the country ‚Äì from 1963 until his death in 1995 ‚Äì was the Canadian-born Bhutanese Jesuit Father William Mackey, who opened several secondary schools and the pre-university Sherubtse College. As his mission was to build up a modern educational system in the country he did not attempt any conversions. 21st century Bhutan's first Catholic priest was convinced to join the clergy by Mother Teresa. There are thought to be about 1,000 Catholics in the country where Christians of all denominations are subject to discrimination. The official religion is Buddhism and Catholic missions have been denied entry. On Palm Sunday, April 8, 2001, Bhutanese police went to churches and registered the names of believers and threatened one pastor with imprisonment after an interrogation. It is illegal for Christians to hold public services and priests are often denied visas to enter the country. The Constitution of Bhutan protects freedom of religion for Bhutanese citizens, but proselytism is forbidden. Article 7.4 states: \\"A Bhutanese citizen shall have the right to freedom of thought conscience and religion. No person shall be compelled to belong to another faith by means of coercion or inducement.\\" The first Bhutanese-born Catholic priest, Rev Kinley Tshering, SJ, was ordained in 1986. He was initially dissuaded by missionaries but after a meeting with Mother Teresa he decided to become a Catholic priest. As a citizen of the country, he travels freely in Bhutan, and celebrates the Christmas Mass under the pretext of his birthday on December 24. He is also thought to be the first convert from Buddhism to the Christian faith in Bhutan. Bhutan has never had a native Catholic hierarchical jurisdiction, but is covered by the Diocese of Darjeeling. The Archbishop of Guwahati in the neighbouring Indian state of Assam visited Catholics throughout the country in 2011 under the banner of a training program for young Bhutanese.

It is owned by iHeartMedia. The station's studios are located along the West Loop Freeway in the city's Uptown district, and the transmitter site is near Missouri City, Texas. KQBT carries two HD Radio sub-channels, including Pride Radio, and an FM simulcast of KTRH. History Early years KQBT was initially signed on by Joel S., Donald J., and James A. Kaufman on December 13, 1963, at 18,460 watts ERP, from an elevation at 457 feet height above average terrain. The facility received a call set of KBNO. The station featured \\"popular music of the time and show tunes\\". The KBNO studios and RCA BTF 5B transmitter were located on the 34th floor of the Gulf Building, and the corner of Main and Rusk Streets in downtown Houston. KBNO received its initial License to Cover on April 7, 1964. In 1970, the station was noted in the movie Brewster McCloud, which featured a station advertisement on the side of a passing bus. In the Fall of 1971, the station changed formats to top 40 as KRLY, but took on various format shifts and identities throughout the decade, such as album oriented rock \\"Y-94\\", \\"Disco 94\\", then \\"KRLY 94\\", a top 40/urban hybrid. By mid-1981, the station had rebranded as \\"Love 94.\\" During its time as ‚ÄúDisco 94,‚Äù radio/television personality turned 2018 congressional political candidate Dayna Steele was among its air staffers. In March 1984, the station switched to adult contemporary as \\"Lite Rock 93.7\\" and changed calls to KLTR (adopted on March 20, 1984). The station rebranded to \\"K-Lite 93.7\\" in the late 1980s. The Arrow On November 25, 1993, at 2 p.m., the station flipped to Classic Hits, branded as \\"Arrow 93.7\\", and launched with Bob Seger's \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\".http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1993/RR-1993-11-26.pdf The KKRW call letters were adopted on December 20, 1993. Over the next decade, the station evolved to straightforward classic rock. In the early 2000s, KKRW was home of the \\"Dean & Rog\\" morning show until they left in early 2009 (currently at KGLK/KHPT). In early 2009, the station began airing (in syndication) former KLOL morning hosts \\"Walton & Johnson\\", who host a politically-oriented morning show that leans right. The show was dropped from KKRW in December 2012 (they're now at sister station KPRC). Afternoon personality Steve Fixx filled in with a music- heavy show for several months called the \\"Morning Classic Rock Fixx\\" until the arrival of veteran St. Louis personality JC Corcoran with \\"JC and the Morning Showgram\\" in March 2013. KKRW enjoyed ratings success for a number of years, both in Arbitron's diary and Portable People Meter ratings measurement systems. KKRW took an initial ratings hit when Dean and Rog left for KGLK, but rebounded to beat the new challenger for roughly a year and a half because of the addition of longtime Houston-based radio shock jocks Walton & Johnson, who helped make KKRW their flagship station. The Beat Ratings remained strong until KGLK, which played a slightly lighter classic rock format (identifying as classic hits), began simulcasting on 106.9 and 107.5 in June 2011. In its last full book with classic rock, KKRW was ranked #17 with a 2.4 share of the market according to Arbitron's Houston market ratings. On December 31, 2013, at 10 a.m., after playing Thin Lizzy's \\"The Boys are Back in Town\\", the station began stunting with music from many genres.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w72w7gRZniwhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f19NSJCZxJg At Noon, after playing Journey's \\"Don't Stop Believin',\\" KKRW flipped to Urban Contemporary, branded as \\"93.7 The Beat.\\" The first song on \\"The Beat\\" was \\"Drunk in Love\\" by Houston native Beyonc√©.http://formatchange.com/93-7-the- beat-debuts/ The move gives Houston a straight-ahead, core-based R&B;/Hip-Hop outlet and new competition for KBXX, whose direction focuses on hit-driven R&B;/Hip-Hop material, as well as KBXX's sister Urban AC KMJQ, both of which are owned by Radio One, and are usually the two dominant stations in the market.\\"93.7 THE BEAT HOUSTON LAUNCHES\\" from Radio Insight (December 31, 2013) It was the first time in 14 years iHeartMedia (then known as Clear Channel Communications) attempted an urban outlet in Houston, as it once owned KBXX and KMJQ from 1994 to 2000, when both were spun off to Radio One.

Life Pamelius was born at Bruges, in the County of Flanders, the son of Adolphe de Joigny de Pamele, lord of Castre and Gotthem, by Madeleine Vanden Heede. His father served in turn as alderman of Bruges, master of requests to the privy council, councillor of state, and imperial privy councillor.A. C. De Schrevel, \\"Pamele (Jacques de Joigny de)\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 16 (Brussels, 1901), 528-542. His elder brother, Guillaume de Pamele, would become president of the Council of Flanders and president of the Brussels Privy Council. Jacobus was educated at the Cistercian Abbey of Boneffe in the County of Namur. He studied philosophy at Louvain University, and graduated magister artium on 27 March 1553. For the next nine years he was a student of theology in Pope's College, Leuven, following the lectures of Ruard Tapper and Josse Ravestein. After graduating Bachelor of Sacred Theology he continued his studies at the Sorbonne. On 19 June 1561, he was made a canon of St. Donatian's Cathedral, Bruges, but was still only a subdeacon. He was probably ordained a priest on 21 February 1562, the first priest ordained by Cardinal Granvelle as Archbishop of Mechelen. He graduated Licentiate of Sacred Theology the same year and settled in Bruges, living with his widowed mother and dedicating much of his time and resources to collecting old manuscripts. The printer Johannes Hervagius (Johann Herwagen the Younger, died 1564), in a Preface Ad Lectorem, credits Pamelius (alone) with a large editorial contribution to the monumental 8-volume 1563 Basel Editio Princeps of the Complete Works of the Venerable Bede, begun under the supervision of Johann Herwagen the elder (died 1557).M. Gorman, \\"The glosses on Bede's 'De temporum ratione' attributed to Byrhtferth of Ramsey\\", in M. Lapidge, M. Godden & S. Keynes (eds), Anglo-Saxon England, 25 (Cambridge University Press 1997), pp. 209 ff. \\"For as in the bringing together of the books of Bede, so also in the emendation and restoration of many readings, Jacobus Pamelius laid out no small effort, an erudite man, one very respected in these matters, and diligent, and one to whom the readers owe a great deal.\\"\\"Ut vero in Bedae libris conquirendis, sic etiam in non paucis locis emendandis et restituendis, praeter alios, non levem operam posuit Iacobus Pamelius, vir eruditus, atque in huiusmodi rebus oculatus, et diligens; cui etiam non parvum debent lectores.\\" Opera Bedae Venerabilis Presbyteri, Anglosaxonis: Viri in Diuinis atque Humanis Literis Exercitatissimi: omnia in octo tomos distincta, 8 vols, (Basileae: Joannes Hervagius 1563), I, \\"Ad Lectorem\\" (front matter). (Google Books) Pamelius devoted himself to the publication of rare texts, continuing with the Micrologus de ecclesiasticis observationibus (Antwerp, Christophe Plantin, 1565), a liturgical commentary of the Roman Ordo which dates probably from the beginning of the twelfth century,On Google Books. and an edition of Cassiodorus's Institutiones divinarum lectionum published jointly with a catalogue of ancient biblical commentaries (Antwerp, Plantin, 1566), which he dedicated to Richard Creagh, Archbishop of Armagh. He was particularly interested in the writings of Cyprian and in liturgical books. From 1568 to 1571 he held the deanery of Bruges, which he had accepted only on condition that he should be allowed to resign at the earliest opportunity. In 1570 he was appointed a member of the commission for the examination of books by Remi Drieux, Bishop of Bruges, and he aided in the publication of the Index expurgatorius of 1571. On 4 May 1574, he replaced George de Vrieze as scholaster of the chapter of St Donatian, and he was an active fundraiser for the establishment of a Jesuit college at Bruges in 1575. The Dutch Revolt was by then in progress, and in response to the 1576 Pacification of Ghent, Pamelius penned a memo for the Flemish bishops (in particular Martin Rythovius, bishop of Ypres, and Remi Drieux, bishop of Bruges) providing arguments against religious toleration. After his death this was printed under the title De religionibus diversis non admittendis (Antwerp, Plantin, 1589). On 20 March 1578, rebel forces took control of Bruges. His efforts to save three Franciscan friars accused of sodomy from the death penalty attracted hostility, and he was obliged to withdraw to Douai. He probably left Bruges on 8 October 1578, the day that the Dominicans, Augustinian Hermits, and Carmelites were expelled. The chapter of Saint-Omer granted him a prebend in 1580, and in 1581 appointed him Archdeacon of Flanders. It was during this period that he put the finishing touches to his long-gestated edition of Tertullian, which was published in Paris in 1584. He continued to develop a reputation for generosity to Catholic refugees in Walloon Flanders, both from parts of the Low Countries under Calvinist control, and from England and Ireland. When Louis de Berlaymont, Archbishop of Cambrai, summoned a provincial council to meet in Mons on 2 October 1586, Pamelius was to accompany Jean Six, bishop of Saint-Omer, as a theological adviser. Bishop Six fell ill at Lille and was unable to continue the journey. The bishop's secretary, Franciscus Lucas Brugensis, remained at his sick-bed and Pamelius went on alone, as the bishop's delegate. Jean Six died on 11 October 1586, and Philip II named Pamelius as his successor as bishop. Pamelius died at Mons, in the County of Hainaut, before receiving his bulls of confirmation. He was buried in Saint Waltrude Collegiate Church in Mons. A service of commemoration was held in Saint-Omer on 20 January 1588, with Guillaume Taelboom delivering the eulogy. Works Besides the Micrologus, he wrote *Liturgica latinorum (Cologne, 1571) *De religionibus diversis non admittendis (Antwerp, 1589) *a catalogue of ancient commentaries on the Bible (Antwerp, 1566) and he edited the works of St. Cyprian (Antwerp, 1566), Tertullian (Paris, 1584), and Hrabanus Maurus (Cologne, 1627).

This is a parable of Jesus which appears in and refers to the final judgment. This parable is the seventh and last in Matthew 13, which began with the parable of the Sower. It directly follows the Parable of the Pearl, which is about the Kingdom of God. Thus, it links the Kingdom of God with the final judgment‚Äîthe separation for hell and heaven. Jesus told the parable to his disciples. The parable is also found in three non-canonical gospels: by Clement of Alexandria, in the Heliand and the Gospel of Thomas. In the Gospel of Thomas, it is referred to as the Parable of the Fisherman. Narrative The parable is as follows: Interpretation \\"The Kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind.\\" Like the parable of the Tares, earlier in Matthew 13, this parable refers to the final judgment.R. T. France, The Gospel According to Matthew: An introduction and commentary, Eerdmans, 1985, , p. 230. Here, the imagery is drawn from the separation of edible from inedible fish caught by a net, probably a seine net.Catholic Encyclopedia: Parables.Craig S. Keener, A Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew, Eerdmans, 1999, , pp. 392-394. One end of the dragnet is held on the shore, the other end is dragged into the sea and returned to the shore. Alternatively, the two ends are held on two boats and then they sweep the sea together. The passage says that \\"the angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous\\" in a similar way to the separation of the tares from the wheat in the parable of the Tares. Arthur Pink explained that \\"The 'good' fish represent believers; their being 'gathered' speaks of association together‚Äîfellowship; while the 'vessels' tell of separation from the world.\\" First, the fishermen will separate believers (the good fish), and finally angels will take away non-believers to hell. According to J Duncan M Derrett, Professor of Oriental Laws in the University of London, the parable is about the technique of a mission. He explains: Jack Dean Kingsbury, Aubrey Lee Brooks professor of theology at Union Presbyterian Seminary in Richmond, Virginia, asserted that the parable is about the harvest. He explained that the present age is different from the future age, but both stand under the divine ordinance. The church should not attempt to establish a holy community. The association of evil with the righteous is only temporary. In the end, the separation will occur and therefore each Christian must examine himself to avoid being declared evil. John Chrysostom described this as a \\"terrible parable,\\"Patrick J. O'Reilly, Light Divine in Parable and Allegory, Kessinger Publishing, 2003 (originally 1930), , p. 116. noting that: > And wherein does this differ from the parable of the tares? For there too > the one are saved, the other perish; but there, for choosing of wicked > doctrines; and those before this again, for not giving heed to His sayings, > but these for wickedness of life; who are the most wretched of all, having > attained to His knowledge, and being caught, but not even so capable of > being saved.John Chrysostom, Homily 47 on Matthew. Jesus' final comments indicate that \\"true teachers of the kingdom display the kingdom's treasure for all to see.\\" Reformer John Calvin interpreted the parable to mean: > Christ informs us, that a mixture of the good and the bad must be patiently > endured till the end of the world; because, till that time, a true and > perfect restoration of the Church will not take place. Again, he warns us, > that it is not enough, and‚Äîwhat is more‚Äîthan it is of little consequence to > us, to be gathered into the fold, unless we are his true and chosen > sheep...[and] that [disciples] might communicate to others what they had > received. In this way [Christ] whets and excites their minds more and more > to desire instruction. He says that teachers are like householders, who do > not only care about their own food, but have a store laid up for the > nourishment of others; and who do not live at ease as to the passing day, > but make provision for a future and distant period. The meaning, therefore, > is, that the teachers of the Church ought to be prepared by long study for > giving to the people, as out of a storehouse, a variety of instruction > concerning the word of God, as the necessity of the case may require. William Barclay elaborated that \\"[The parable] lays it down that there must be no selectiveness in the preaching of the gospel. To us, that is something of a commonplace... But to the ancient world, this was an amazing thing. The ancient world everywhere was a world of barriers and of contempt.\\" The Parable of the Scribes at the end is generally regarded as part of the parable. But some scholars consider it separate, hence, making up eight‚Äînot seven‚Äîparables in Matthew 13. Non-canonical version The Parable of the Dragnet is also found in the writings of Clement of Alexandria (c. 150-215 CE), in the Heliand (9th-century CE poem) and the Gospel of Thomas. The storylines are similar but with slight variations.

In addition to the WildC.A.T.s, he has also fought Team One, Gen¬π¬≥, Backlash, and when folded into the DC Universe, Superman. Fictional character biography A member of the alien race known as the Daemonites, Helspont was a military lord, essentially the general who would command Daemonite forces in the field.WildC.A.T.s #20 (May 1995) Helspont possessed a being from another alien race (before the Wildstorm Universe separated from the Image universe, the being he possessed was an Acurian) at some unknown point in time (centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire, according to Spartan), becoming his usual form.Majestic vol. 2 #17 (July 2006) Helspont was stationed on the Daemonite ship that crashed on Earth thousands of years ago. He, along with the two other highest ranked surviving Daemonites, took the title High Lord and became a leader to the other Daemonites. Helspont had many Daemonites serving under him, though another lord, Defile, formed his own rival faction. Helspont and his servants also formed alliances with several humans over the years, using the name \\"The Cabal\\" to refer to their organization at least once before the mid 20th Century.Team One: Stormwatch #2 (August 1995)Team One: WildC.A.T.s #2 (September 1995) During the Third Crusade, Helspont found an English crusader, Dakor of Cambria, who intended to commit suicide.Grifter vol. 2 #9 (March 1997) Dakor had previously been found, severely injured, by the Kherubim warrior Zealot, then known as Constance, who attempted to train him in the ways of the Coda, the female warrior society to which she belonged. However, Dakor had failed Constance's tests, and she and another Coda defeated him in combat. Shamed by having been defeated by women, Dakor attempted suicide, only to be stopped by Helspont, who convinced him that Constance had used magic to steal his strength, and that the duel was unfair due to him being outnumbered. Helspont, wanting his own organization to counter-balance the Coda, had Dakor create a group of warriors known as the Quiet Men. The Quiet Men would go on to fight against the Coda and Zealot multiple times over the following centuries. In the 1960s, Helspont encountered post-human mobster Slaughterhouse Smith and his gang, offering Smith control over North America by the end of the decade if he allied himself with Helspont against humanity,Team One: WildC.A.T.s #1 (July 1995) although how Helspont planned to achieve this has yet to be revealed. Helspont, his Daemonite foot-soldiers and Smith and his gang formed a new Cabal. Helspont led the Cabal in an attack on a U.S. nuclear missile base with the aim of using the nuclear missiles in the base to hold the country for ransom. Helspont ordered the Cabal to nuke New York City as a warning to the government, though Smith refused, since his family lived in New York, and his men turned against him, siding with Helspont. Helspont revealed his true goal to Smith as the destruction of the world. The U.S. government strike team known as Team One attempted to foil the Cabal's plans. Helspont briefly engaged in battle with Marc Slayton, before the fight was interrupted by Cabal member Daniel Pike. Helspont then found himself locked in battle with one his most hated enemies, Mr. Majestic, the two being evenly-matched. Helspont's plan failed due to Team One's intervention, and he went on to escape. Reunification Helspont returned with a new plan in the 90s. Instead of eradicating the human race on his own, he planned on contacting a Daemonite armada. Once contact was established, the next stage of his plan was to open a stargate in Earth's orbit so the fleet of alien ships at Daemon could reach Earth quickly and attack from space. The name of the process was the Reunification. In order to create and maintain the portal needed for the Reunification, Helspont needed one of several magical orbs of power. One of the other orbs was carried inside the body of Void, a member of the WildC.A.T.s. Since she carried an orb inside her, she knew when another one was being targeted and was able to warn Lord Emp, leader of the WildC.A.T.s before it was too late, and they fought to prevent Helspont from succeeding. In order to help him get the orb before the WildC.A.T.s could stop him, Helspont created his own group, a new incarnation of The Cabal. This Cabal was made up of Helspont, a Coda, Pike, a psychic named Providence, and a few humans and numerous Daemonites. The first battle between the WildC.A.T.s and Helspont's people occurred in the first issue of WildC.A.T.S: Covert Action Teams, when Grifter was sent to get Voodoo to join the team. During his attempt at recruiting her, he was attacked by Helspont's hired Coda warrior and two Daemonites. The attack ended with the entire area destroyed in a fiery explosion and the death of Helspont's soldiers and the escape of the WildC.A.T.s. Helspont thought they were dead though, and continued with his plan for Reunification. The next stage involved having one of his Daemonites break into a NASA compound and steal the orb. After that was done, the last step was getting a Daemonite into the body of Dan Quayle, the Vice President of the United States. This went without incident and now, with an inside man, he was able to secure a military base where he could access the right machinery to operate the orb in order to create the stargate. To keep the WildC.A.T.s off his back, he'd tricked them into fight the Youngblood, another Wildstorm Team. Before the two teams could figure out they had been tricked, Spartan was almost totally destroyed. Voodoo and Maul were also incapacitated and the rest of the team was forced abandon them and go after Helspont alone. Just as Helspont and his scientists had started to activate the machines to begin the Reunification, the remainder of the WildC.A.T.s (Emp, Zealot, Grifter, Warblade and Void) arrived and attacked. While Helspont tried to hurry up the process of Reunification, the super powered members of his Cabal (Pike and The Coda and a Daemonite) fought the WildC.A.T.s. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the base, another member of Helspont's Cabal arrived with his own minions. Gnome had planned on betraying Helspont from the start so he could wield the power of the orb on his own. He'd hired the Troika and his own Coda warrior and while Helspont's people fought the C.A.T.s, he made his way towards them. Unbeknown to all of these people, back where the Youngblood and WildC.A.T.s had been fighting, Voodoo, Maul and Spartan had all regained enough strength to kill the Daemonite in the body of the Vice President and fill the Youngblood in on what was happening. Back in the heart of the base, Helspont saw Emp for the first time that night and recognized him as an enemy he'd thought he'd killed when he fought Team One. This obviously angered Helspont and he started fighting on his own, no longer relying on Pike and The Coda to do it for him. With a few energy attacks and psychic assaults, he quickly took down the WildC.A.T.s on his own. With all his enemies out of the picture, Helspont activated the orb, opened a stargate in Earth-space and the night sky began to fill with Daemonite ships. As Helspont basked in his victory, Voodoo, Maul and the entire Youngblood team (accompanied by Dan Quayle) attacked. This didn't bother him though. He laughed as he created a powerful energy shield that stopped the combined attack and then disabled the entire team in one blast. As the orb continued to bring in more ships, Emp used a hidden communicator to contact Spartan, who was at the buildings core, where the machines that powered the whole place were. Still damaged from before, he used the last of his power to shut down the entire compound. As a result, the orb stopped working properly (destroying ships in transit as well as ones near the stargate) and the machines that had been powering it exploded. Helspont was thrown back by the explosion but wouldn't give up on his chance to take over the world. He went to get what was left of the orb so he could use it, but when he reached the machine, he found Gnome and his men. Gnome revealed that he had rigged the whole place to blow and before anyone could react, he unleashed all of the power of the orb onto Helspont in an attempt to kill him. As Helspont lay motionless on the ground, the WildC.A.T.s attacked Gnome and the Troika. Emp blew off the arm of Gnome and he dropped the orb down a shaft. He dove after it while everyone that was still alive escaped the building. The entire compound exploded moments later and Helspont, Gnome and the orb were all assumed dead or destroyed. Mr. Majestic Helspont went on to pose as James Wyvern, owner of technology company Pacificon.Majestic vol. 2 #9 (November 2005) Much of the technology created by Pacificon was reverse-engineered from Kherubim tech. Majestic, his partner Desmond and Zealot of the Wildcats encountered Wyvern in a defective Planet Shaper, which Wyvern had designs on. Helspont went on to reveal his true identityMajestic vol. 2 #10 (December 2005)Majestic vol. 2 #11 (January 2006) and obtain control over the Planet Shaper, using to reveal its purpose and means of operation. The Planet Shaper revealed that it existed to not only alter planets to better match the conditions necessary for Kherubim life, but also generate Kherubim life forms and alter existing beings into servant species and keep them from rebelling against the Kherubim, the Daemonites being a potential servant species that were considered too aberrant, leading the Kherubim to attempt to exterminate them, leading to the Kherubim-Daemonite War. This revelation led Helspont to feel his hatred of Kherubim was further justified, and he attacked Majestic and Zealot. Helspont eventually ceased his attack and fled. Desmond, still attached to the Planet Shaper, contacted Helspont telepathically. When Majestic (and Spartan) were ready to go fight the other Kherubim, they were met by Helspont, who was to be their ally. What Majestic and Spartan didn't know, was that Helspont planned on taking the Planet Shaper for himself after they took it from the Kherubim. Once inside the machine, Helspont fought Imperator (a Kherubim with powers like Majestic) while Majestic and Spartan took on other enemies. Helspont put up a good fight, easily beating Imperator for most of their battle, but the more they fought, the more his hate for Kherubim grew, and he stopped fighting smart. Imperator took the opportunity to laser Helspont's throat, then punch through him, ending his life. Or so he thought. Helspont, using his Daemonite powers, jumped into the body of Desmond, who was still connected to the machine. His mind now part of the Planet Shaper, he used the machines holograms to trick Imperator into thinking the world had been destroyed, which left him in a coma. Majestic arrived and took away Imperator's body, but wasn't fooled by the corpse of Helspont's old host. He knew that his enemy was still alive and would use the Planet Shaper to take over the world if he wasn't stopped. For almost three months Helspont and Majestic fought a new kind of battle. Instead of a physical one, it was a game of patience. Helspont kept trying to activate the machines terraforming processes and Majestic kept shutting them down. It couldn't go on forever though, since Majestic was dying of a disease he'd gotten from time traveling too much. Against all probability, Helspont was the one to lose. The Planet Shaper could only remain functional while there were living things on Earth, but right when Majestic was about to die, all life on Earth was kidnapped by a powerful alien force, something Majestic knew was going to happen thanks to his time traveling. With the machine deactivated, Helspont was trapped in Desmond's dead body. Majestic, dying as he did it, took Desmond's body off the machine and blasted it to ash with laser vision, killing Helspont once and for all. Helspont's victory had been snatched from him yet again. Helspont Redux In the Wildstorm Universe relaunch (WildCats v4) Helspont is alive and well but very different from how he was before. Though he looks mostly the same, everything about Helspont has changed. Instead of being a normal Daemonite with an amazingly powerful body, Helspont is now super evolved, living hive mind. When the number of Daemonites reaches a certain number, a \\"central mind\\" is created. It has the knowledge and intelligence of every member of the entire Daemonite race and its (synthetic) body is a mix of flesh, metal and fire. Not only does Helspont now have the minds of every Daemonite within his own, but now he can control every single Daemonite with a thought. Because of all this, he is leagues more powerful than he was before, but the state of his personal powers levels has not been addressed yet. The only thing we know about him is that he has a Daemonite armada and he's teamed up with Kaizen Gamorra to try to take over the world. Other schemes Helspont has tried many times to either take over or destroy the world, but most of them weren't major enough to get their own stories. His plan to use America's own nukes to jump start a nuclear holocaust and wipe out all of humanity was very nearly successful and prompted the creation of a super hero team, so the event was cataloged. Likewise, Project Reunification actually did work, and, if not for the last minute interference of Spartan and the work of a traitorous ally, Helspont would have ruled the world. These were the major attempts, but there were others. Going by human history, his very first plot involved him traveling through time. It is unknown when he started from, but he arrived Ancient Rome. This was just a stop on his way to when the Daemonites and Kherubim first landed on Earth, though. He planned on traveling back to the Kherubim ship and using his Acurian body and powers (which he didn't have originally at that point in time) to take out the Kherubim ship and stop his from crashing. This plan was foiled by the WildC.A.T.s who were also traveling back in time to stop someone else from rewriting history. Helspont was prevented from traveling further back in time, but one of his henchmen, a Daemonite named Mortuus, was able to make it back as planned. He made it back to the Kherubim ship, but was killed by Zealot in the past before he could do anything. Sometime after his first run in with the WildC.A.T.s and his failed attempt at Reunification, the event Wildstorm Rising took place. Wildstorm Rising involved most of the other Wildstorm Universe characters and teams and gave Helspont a chance to become the enemy of them all. During the crossover event, rumors of a Daemonite vessel from the original crash to Earth started to fly around. Characters from all over the place were investigating these rumors and everyone wanted the ship. Along with all the good guys that were after it, there were many villains who wanted it too, and Helspont was just one of them. He wanted to take the ship and get to Daemon where he could gather a force to come back to Earth to take over or just leave the planet and never return. The ship turned out not to be a Daemonite one, but a Kheran one. This didn't deter Helspont (or anyone else) and they all continued to fight over it. At one point, Helspont stood against every Wildstorm hero and was ready to take them all on. In the fight that followed, he effortlessly swept most of them aside with his amazing telekinetic and energy manipulation powers, but eventually got locked in a battle with none other than Mr. Majestic. The battle was going nowhere but while Majestic kept him busy, the WildC.A.T.s were able to get aboard the ship and take off, but not before shooting Helspont with the ships lasers. Though he survived, he failed to get the ship. Shortly after Wildstorm Rising, Helspont tried to rule the world by getting as much power as he could as a human. This plan was the least obvious and so he got away with it without the interference of super groups. Instead of trying to destroy the world straight out, he first tried to control it like humans did, with money. To this end, he created Pacificon, a legitimate company, and started selling alien technology as a human named James Wyvern. This strategy took years, but eventually he became a supplier for governments worldwide and was well on his way to economic domination. This plan came to an end when Helspont learned of the Planet Shaper, a machine he wanted to use to turn the world into a place suitable only for Daemonites. When he went to secure the machine, he ran into Mr. Majestic and was forced to abandon his previous plan and secret identity. One of Helspont's schemes for world domination didn't even occur in this reality. In the Heroes Reborn: World War 3 event, Helspont joined forces with Doctor Doom and the Skrulls to take over Earth. After Doom went back in time to avert a disaster, the Wildstorm and Marvel realities mixed. Doom seized an opportunity and took advantage of being the first to know about the melding of the universes. He forged an alliance with Helspont in order to have access to Daemonite troops. Helspont was his second in command in all things and together with the Skrulls, they succeeded in taking over this new world. They ruled from Latveria and thanks to Daemonite troops and special genetic monstrosities that Helspont provided, there was almost no force that could stop them. The only reason they lost control was because they were separated, and also because of Deathblow and the Thing. Doom went to The Negative Zone to stop the heroes from destroying a device he had hidden there. If they destroyed it and similar device in the real world, the universes would go back to normal. While he was gone, Deathblow, who had only just appeared in this universe tackled Helspont into the device in the real world, destroying it. With one device weakened, the other was easy to destroy, so as usual, the combined forces of all of Earth's heroes was able to set things right. The universes were split and all the Wildstorm characters were sent back to their own world, with neither universe remembering what had happened. Influence Though he is a major force in the Wildstorm Universe, Helspont himself has not been in very many comics (less than 25 in total). However, the effects of his few appearances have had consequences that have rippled throughout the entire Wildstorm Universe, even bridging into other comics and story lines. The most obvious was the creation of I.O.'s Teams. Team 1 was created in response to Helspont's first attacks, and all the members of the team went on to create or be in teams of their own or even work solo, (Stormwatch, The Authority, WildC.A.T.s, Backlash) but it didn't stop there. Other teams (Team 7 being the most well known) were created in much the same fashion. Their targets weren't Helspont (at least not the teams we know about) but they would not have been instituted if not for the example of Team 1. During his fight with Team 1, Helspont forced Mr. Majestic to kill John Colt (Spartan). After John Colt died, his body returned to life and became Kaizen Gamorra, another major Wildstorm villain. Helspont was also major force in Wildstorm Rising and helped shape its outcome. He took out everyone else so only the WildC.A.T.s could get the ship. This led to the discovery that the war was over, the creation of the new team on Earth (which led to Tao and the Sleeper series), and the change in direction of the old team when it returned to Earth. So though he isn't often seen, the repercussions of Helspont's actions have leaked through Wildstorm history and made him one of the most notable villains in the Wildstorm Universe. The New 52 In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, which merges the Wildstorm universe, the Helspont and the Daemonites origin is adjusted. Nearly four thousand years ago, the Daemonite prince Artus returned to his mother's castle carrying the body of his dead wife, a victim of what he believes is the genetic decline of their species. The combination of Daemonite DNA with other species resulted in the spread of auto-immune deficiencies, cancers, higher infant mortality rates and Artus believed this weakened their race. As a result of this, he was cast out of court by his mother, all while he swore that he would return his people to their proper place as conquerors of the universe.Superman Annual (Volume 3) #1 Taking the name Helspont, Artus' peoples' fear caused him to be imprisoned in the Eye, which would eventually become the headquarters of Stormwatch. Some 4,000 years later, when Harry Tanner set off an explosion that ripped the Eye apart, Helspont's prison cell crashed on Earth in the Himalayas.Superman (Volume 3) #6 Helspont, now freed, established a new base, and confronted Superman, who destroyed his base.Superman (Volume 3) #7-8 The villain returns and sends a full-scale assault against Superman and other alien heroes such as Starfire and Hawkman, trying to recruit them, during which he admits that never intended destroy earth or to see Superman dead. In fact by protecting people, he protects the human genes from the corruption that destroyed his race. Helspont believes Superman may need to be \\"tamed\\" by surviving Daemonites. Before disappearing, Helspont mentioned Jor-El, leaving Superman to contemplate the high risk of a future invasion from Helspont. The Wild Storm In the 2017 reboot of the Wildstorm Universe, \\"Ragnar Helspont\\" is named as the chief scientist of the Thunderbook program ( the reboot's analogue to Gen12 ) responsible for implanting human subjects with Kheran DNA. Powers and abilities Helspont's host body has shown superhuman strength and durability, comparable to Mister Majestic. Furthermore, his Acurian host gives him vast psionic powers including telekinesis and mental attacks as well as energy blasts. Helspont has the ability to change his shape, appearing like a normal human, but this may be a telepathic illusion rather than a physical power. Like all Daemonites he can possess host bodies at will, though doing so would mean he has to give up his powerful Acurian host body. He can presumably take the shape of his true Daemonite form, however he always appears in his Acurian form. As a Daemonite, Helspont has access to highly advanced technology. As High Lord of all Daemonites on Earth, he can command dozens of Daemonites to do his bidding. There are Daemonites who don't obey him though, like Lord Defile and Hightower. Furthermore, many Daemonites deserted after hearing about the end of the war. In other media * In the WildC.A.T.s animated series, Helspont was the most recurring villain of the series.

It is the fifth volume of The Edge Chronicles and the first of the Rook Saga trilogy; within the stories' own chronology it is the seventh novel, following the Quint Saga and Twig Saga trilogies. Unlike the previous books in the series, this focuses on Rook Barkwater and Felix Lodd, but the main character of the first three books, Twig, is present as well. The story is of young Rook as he becomes a librarian knight and is pitted against the Guardians of the Night, including Xanth Filantine. The character of Vox Verlix is mentioned, setting up for the sixth book, Vox. Plot summary Rook Barkwater lives in the network of sewer- chambers beneath Undertown, in which a society of librarians has established itself, secretly opposing the cruel Guardians of Night. Rook, a lowly under- librarian, dreams of becoming a librarian knight‚Äîone of the select few to travel into the Deepwoods and gather information which may lead to the discovery of the cure to stone-sickness (an affliction which has destroyed the buoyant rocks, making skysailing impossible). Rook does not expect his dreams ever to come true‚Äîhis best friend, Felix Lodd, seems a much more likely candidate‚Äîbut, to everyone's surprise, Rook is chosen to be a knight, along with Stob Lummus and Magda Burlix. Rook, Magda and Stob make their way along the Great Mire Road, a shryke-controlled bridge that has been built to traverse the marshy Mire in place of sky ships. While on the way, Rook helps an imprisoned sky pirate, Deadbolt Vulpoon, to escape. Finally, the librarian knights arrive in the Eastern Roost, a large shryke-city. Employing the help of a male shryke, Hekkle, who is friendly to the librarians, the three make their way across the Deepwoods, eventually arriving at the Free Glades. After arriving there, Rook, Stob and Magda are joined by Xanth Filatine, a disguised Guardian of Night who is secretly channelling information to the Guardians so that they may ambush the librarian knights as they travel. During Rook's studies, he learns to create a skycraft, which is a small, flying one-person vehicle. Xanth breaks his leg in a skycraft accident, and cannot embark upon his treatise-voyage, the journey for which the knights have been studying. Rook also makes a raid on the Foundry Glade, along with Felix Lodd's sister Varis Lodd (who saved Rook from slavers when he was very young) and the slaughterer Knuckle. The purpose of this raid is to free the banderbear slaves that are kept there. During this raid, Rook takes a poisoned arrow to the chest to save a banderbear's life. Rook embarks on his treatise-voyage. His goal is to find the Great Convocation of Banderbears. Rook befriends a young banderbear named Wumeru, and he follows her, against her will, to the Convocation. The banderbears discover his presence and are about to kill him when the banderbear who Rook saved in the Foundry Glade stands up for him. Rook is then introduced to Twig, the main character and sky pirate from the second Edge Chronicles trilogy, now an old man. Twig reveals that his sky ship, the Skyraider, has not yet succumbed to stone-sickness. Along with a crew of banderbears, the two set out to attack the fortress of the Guardians of Night: the Tower of the same name. Their purpose is to free Cowlquape Pentephraxis, an old friend of Twig's. While Twig and the Skyraider keep the Guardians busy, Rook sneaks into the tower on his skycraft and frees Cowlquape. As he is about to fly free, a rope becomes snagged and the skycraft is stuck. Xanth, the traitor, confronts Rook. The two had become good friends during their time together in the Free Glades, a fact that Xanth apparently had not forgotten. Xanth cuts the rope quickly, allowing Rook to fly away safely with Cowlquape. The Skyraider, meanwhile, had succumbed to stone- sickness, and was slowly dropping over the Edge. Rook and Cowlquape mourn the end of Twig, who had been struck by the crossbow-bolt of the chief guardian of night, Orbix Xaxis and had decided to go down with his ship. However, at the last minute, Twig's caterbird, who had sworn to watch over him for always, catches him and flies towards the rejuvenating waters of Riverrise. Whether they make it in time is left as a cliffhanger.

R. Rao, was an Indian archaeologist who led teams credited with discoveries of a number of Harappan sites including the port city Lothal and Bet Dwarka in Gujarat.  Biography and career  Rao was born on 1 July 1922 into a Madhwa Brahmin family. He completed his education from Mysore University. He worked in the Archaeological Department of Baroda State and subsequently served the Archaeological Survey of India in various capacities. Rao has led excavations of many important sites such as Rangpur, Amreli, Bhagatrav, Dwarka, Hanur, Aihole, Kaveripattinam and others. One of his most important works were leading the research and excavations at Lothal, the earliest known port in history and the most important Indus-era site in India. Rao was the recipient of Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowship and a doctorate of literature from Mysore University. Rao had supervised excavation of several historic sites across the country in the West and South. He was also associated with conservation of monuments such as Taj Mahal and forts. Despite officially retiring in 1980 Rao was requested to work for the ASI Director General in leading Indian archaeological projects. It was under Rao's initiative that the NIO opened a marine archaeology research centre in 1981, under the stewardship of then director Syed Zahoor Qasim, which grew into a world recognised body. He was the founder of the Society of Marine Archaeology in India. Rao has been at the forefront of Indian archaeology for many decades - he was involved in extensive research into India's ancient past, from the sites of the Indus Valley Civilization to excavations pertaining to the Kurukshetra War.  Indus script decipherment claim  Rao (1992) claimed to have deciphered the Indus script. Postulating uniformity of the script over the full extent of Indus-era civilization, he compared it to the Phoenician Alphabet, and assigned sound values based on this comparison. His decipherment results in an \\"Sanskritic\\" reading, including the numerals aeka, tra, chatus, panta, happta/sapta, dasa, dvadasa, sata (1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 100). While mainstream scholarship is generally in agreement with Rao's approach of comparison, the details of his decipherment have not been accepted, and the script is still generally considered undeciphered. John E. Mitchiner, after dismissing some more fanciful attempts at decipherment, mentions that \\"a more soundly-based but still greatly subjective and unconvincing attempt to discern an Indo-European basis in the script has been that of Rao\\". In a 2002 interview with The Hindu, Rao asserted his faith in his decipherment, saying that \\"Recently we have confirmed that it is definitely an Indo-Aryan language and deciphered. Prof. W. W. De Grummond of Florida State University has written in his article that I have already deciphered it.\\"Rao refers to a statement by W. W. De Grummond, of the Department of Classics, Florida State University, that \\"Dr. Rao's decipherment of the Indus script has met with considerable acceptance and will serve now as a basis for further and continuing study of the language of the ancient Indus Valley civilization.\\" in \\"Linguistic Affinities of Old Indo-Aryan with Classical Greek and Latin\\", B.U. Nayak, N.C. Ghosh (eds.) New Trends in Indian Art and Archaeology: S.R. Rao's 70th birthday felicitation volume, Aditya Prakashan (1992), pp. 133-139.  Identification of Dwarka  At Kushasthali (Bet Dwarka), a strip of sand and stone situated north of town of Dwarka, Rao and his team found a wall (560 metres long) visible on the shore itself. Dating of pottery found here gave a date of 1528 BCE based on thermoluminescence datingS.R.Rao, The Lost City of Dvaraka. National Institute of Oceanography 1999 Further unearthed was a seal (mudra). Rao asserted the three-holed triangular stone anchors found in large numbers in Dwarka waters suggested a continuity in evolution of the anchors in Lothal and Mohenjodaro, which had a single hole, and that the Dwarka anchors of late Harappan phase are a couple of centuries older than the identical anchors of late Bronze Age used in Cyprus and Syria.However, later on the NIO dated the stone anchors to be of fourteenth century of Common Era. It also stated that similar such anchors have been found in other old ports of India. Rao asserts that the unearthed remains at Dwarka were the historical city that was home to Krishna, believed to be the eighth Avatar of Vishnu. According to the Mahabharata, Krishna built Dwarka at Kushasthali‚Äîa fortress in the sea which is currently in ruins. Then he built another city at the mouth of the Gomti River. The Mahabharata also refers to how Krishna wanted every citizen to carry some sort of identity‚Äîa mudra.However, his claims were never widely accepted by the scholarly community.

The village of Hofwil was originally part of the lands owned by the M√ºnchenbuchsee Commandery, a medieval commandery of the Knights Hospitaller in nearby M√ºnchenbuchsee. After the commandery was suppressed during the Protestant Reformation, Hofwil was owned by a number of nobles. In 1719 Hieronymus von Erlach combined the village with Moosseedorf. Hofwil Castle was built in 1784-86 by the architect Carl Ahasver von Sinner for Gabriel Albrecht von Erlach. A peristyle was added to the neo-classical building in 1798. The Hofwil Institution was built by Philipp Emanuel von Fellenberg, a Bernese patrician. He took over the estate of Hofwyl in 1798 and transformed it into several schools to educate all levels of society. He established a school for the poor, a secondary school for local students and an institute for the sons of wealthy families throughout Europe.Hofwil Gymnasium website accessed 4 February 2013 The institute, which was founded in 1808, gradually became the largest school and developed an international reputation. The Hofwil Institution building was built in 1817-21 as a center piece of Emanuel von Fellenberg's educational vision. The outbuildings were built in 1818, followed by a teacher's house in 1819 and another school building around 1820. After Fellenberg's death in 1844 the schools struggled and eventually every one closed. The Canton of Bern bought the building in 1884 to house the expansion of the teachers' college, which had been founded in 1833 in M√ºnchenbuchsee. Over the following decades it became just a preparatory school which fed into the main teacher's college in Bern. However, in 1973 it once again became a full college. In 1997 it changed again, this time into a music institute for the 10th through 12th grade. The building also houses an optional boarding school for students. The swimming pool at Hofwil, the Hofwil Institution and Hofwil Castle are listed as Swiss heritage site of national significance. The entire area around Hofwil is part of the Inventory of Swiss Heritage Sites.

PASDA serves as Pennsylvania's node on the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI). PASDA is a cooperative effort of the Pennsylvania Geospatial Technologies Office of the Office of Information Technology and the Pennsylvania State University Institutes of Energy and the Environment (PSIEE). Early history Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access (PASDA), the official public geospatial data clearinghouse for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania marked its 18th year in 2014. PASDA, which has grown from a small website offering 35 data sets in 1996 to the expansive user-centered data clearinghouse that it is today, has become a staple of the GIS community in Pennsylvania. PASDA provides access to thousands of data files, terabytes of data, and hundreds of Internet Map Services, Google Earth KML files, metadata, mapping applications, and other information like guides and tutorials. PASDA was developed by the Pennsylvania State University as a service to the citizens, governments, and businesses of the Commonwealth. PASDA is a cooperative project of the Governor's Office of Administration, Office for Information Technology, Geospatial Technologies Office and Penn State Institutes for Energy and the Environment of the Pennsylvania State University. Funding is provided by the Pennsylvania Office for Information Technology, Geospatial Technologies Office. The Pennsylvania State University provides additional substantial support to PASDA for system administration, database technologies administration, and infrastructure. The High Performance Computing Center at Penn State is also providing significant resources and support for PASDA. PASDA is housed at Penn State Institutes of Energy and the Environment (PSIEE). The purpose of Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access (PASDA) is to serve as a comprehensive geospatial data digital library by providing free, universal access to geospatial data and information by, for, and about the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. PASDA has served for almost 20 years as the Commonwealth's node on the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI), Geospatial One Stop, and the National Biological Information Infrastructure. Data & Metadata creation The data made available through PASDA is provided by our data partners to encourage the widespread sharing of geospatial data, eliminate the creation of redundant data sets, and to further build an inventory (through the development and hosting of metadata) of available data relevant to the Commonwealth. PASDA serves as a resource for locating data throughout the Commonwealth through its data storage, interactive mapping/webgis applications, and metadata/documentation efforts. PASDA services are provided free of charge to all users and data providers. The data on PASDA is provided by federal, state, local and regional government agencies, non-profit organizations, and academic institutions throughout the region. Data updates to existing datasets come to PASDA at different intervals and are based on the update frequency of our data partners. Monthly, quarterly, and annual updates are the norm and include PennDOT, PA Department of Environmental Protection, PA Fish and Boat Commission, PA Department of Health, PA Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Chester County, Allegheny County, Lancaster County, City of Philadelphia, Southeast PA Transportation Authority, Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, PA DCNR Rivers Conservation Program, and the Natural Lands Trust. The development of metadata on PASDA is one of the most important functions. The background of PASDA's metadata development has its origins in the development of the ANSI Z39.50 standard (also known as the ISO 23950 Search and Retrieval Protocol.Kelly, M.C., Baxter, R.E., & Haupt, B.J. (2008). The evolution of spatial data infrastructure (SDI) geospatial data clearinghouses: Architecture and services. In Encyclopedia of Data Warehousing and Mining, (2nd ed.). Hershey, Pennsylvania: Idea Group, Inc.) This protocol was originally designed for libraries to search and retrieve records from remote library catalogs.Nebert, D. (Ed.) (2004). Developing spatial data infrastructures: The SDI cookbook (v.2). Global Spatial Data Infrastructure Association. http://www.gsdi.org. PASDA's goal is not only to meet the existing metadata standards but also to create metadata in a format that supports easy search and retrieval of data. In the early stages of PASDA's development the metadata was either in HTML or text format and was subsequently parsed with a metadata parser. PASDA was one of the first clearinghouses to implement the use of XML(Extensible Markup Language).Kelly, M.C. & Stauffer, B.E. (2000). User needs and operations requirements for the Pennsylvania Geospatial Data Clearinghouse. University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University, Environmental Resources Research Institute. Services & Applications PASDA provides direct access to download data via FTP. Currently, PASDA has approximately 60 terabytes of data for download including vector data, imagery, elevation and lidar.In addition to direct download, PASDA has developed multiple ways to access data. In 2000, PASDA was one of the first clearinghouses to address issues related to what is known as \\"clip, ship, and reproject\\"‚Äîa process by which large data sets can be clipped to a user specified geography, reprojected, and zipped for quick download. Subsequent advances, in particular the development of Internet Map Services, have, in part, eliminated the need for these specialized services.Kelly, M.C., Haupt, B.J., & Baxter, R.E. (2009). Internet map services and Web GIS: The new paradigm in spatial and temporal data integration over the Web. In Encyclopedia of Database Technologies and Applications, (2nd ed.). Hershey, Pennsylvania: Idea Group, Inc. One of the most important developments in GIS in the past decade has been the ability to create Internet Map Services‚Äîalso known simply as map services. Map services allow users to consume or pull in data to their GIS software without actually having to download it thereby saving download time and storage space. Map services have been some of the most heavily used features on PASDA and support multiple types of web based GIS applications. In addition to downloading data and creating map services, many GIS clearinghouses also have created web based GIS applications. The applications available through PASDA include the Pennsylvania Atlas‚Äîa data visualization and download app, the Pennsylvania Imagery Navigator‚Äîa data visualization, search and retrieval app for imagery and LIDAR, and the Pennsylvania Mine Map Atlas. The Pennsylvania Mine Map Atlas is a joint project of PASDA and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. This Mine Map Atlas provides access to thousands of scanned, georeferenced underground mine maps in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. It allows users to view their homes and see if any mines are beneath those homes. The purpose of this effort is to identify houses and other structures at risk of mine subsidence, ground movement caused by the collapse of old, abandoned mines. The final number of mine maps that will be provided through this application is expected to near 100,000 individual maps. Related Initiatives & Users PASDA has participated in numerous national and international level initiatives since its beginnings in 1996. PASDA was an original member of the ESRI Geography Network and ESRI's ArcGIS.com. In addition, PASDA metadata is harvested by multiple data portals including Geospatial One Stop, Data.gov, and the National Biological Information Infrastructure. PASDA is an open data portal‚Äîmeaning that is provides open, free, unrestricted access to data in multiple formats.Open data PASDA provides data storage, data access and retrieval, and metadata services free of charge to its data providers because access to data drives economic development, conservation efforts, and collaboration. The data made available through PASDA is provided by data partners to encourage the widespread sharing of geospatial data, eliminate the creation of redundant data sets, and to further build an inventory (through the development and hosting of metadata) of available data relevant to the Commonwealth. The PASDA user base is extensive. Users come from a broad spectrum of organizations and backgrounds, from teachers and citizens to businesses and government agencies‚ÄîPASDA provides free access to data, applications, and customization tools to meet the needs of every user. PASDA saw a dramatic increase of use in almost every sector driven in part by factors such as Marcellus Shale exploration, environmental conservation, economic development initiatives, expanded use of geospatial data in universities, non profits, and the private sector, and the increased interest from average citizens who are able to access geospatial information via PASDA‚Äôs data previewer and KML files without the need for specialized GIS software. The use of PASDA has continually increased over its history. In the past year, almost 2 million files were downloaded from the PASDA FTP site; while usage on the entire site topped 71 million hits, over 28 million page views, and over 1 million unique visitors. The PASDA web servers, which provide access to Internet Map Services and PASDA applications like the Imagery Navigator and PA Atlas supported over 57 million map views. The statistics this year demonstrate more than any other that there is a wide range of data that is of great interest to the user community. Data (and map services created from data) from partners at the PA Department of Environmental Protection, PennDOT, PA Fish and Boat Commission, PA Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Allegheny County, the DCNR PAMAP Program, and the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission received phenomenal use‚Äîwith map service views and data downloads in the millions or hundreds of thousands. In addition, PASDA has created highly significant applications and services that dramatically increase the value of the data available. The Imagery Navigator supported almost 6.3 million views and the Aerial Photo Cache supported almost 22.4 million views.

The bridge connects the west side of Louisville, Kentucky to downtown New Albany, Indiana. History In 1952 the \\"Second Street Bridge\\" was reaching peak traffic, and the K&I; Bridge faring similarly. Arthur W. Grafton commissioned two studies in 1952 and 1953, with their results being a need for two bridges in Louisville; one crossing to Jeffersonville, Indiana, and the other to New Albany. Hoosiers as far as Scottsburg, Indiana ( away) were vastly against making any bridges toll, and many residents of Louisville were against toll bridges as well. When the Interstate Highway System was announced by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the solution became clear. The Federal government would finance 90% of both bridges, with Indiana paying 10% of the New Albany bridge, and Kentucky paying 10% of the Jeffersonville bridge.Kleber p.123 The New Albany bridge was given to Hazelet & Erdal, of Louisville to design in 1956. Construction began in June 1959, and was completed in August 1962. It was built at a cost of $14.8 million. In December 1962 Indiana governor Matthew E. Welsh announced it would be named for the former United States Senator and Supreme Court justice Sherman Minton, who was a native of New Albany.Kleber pp.123,418 The American Institute of Steel Construction in 1961 named it the most beautiful long-span bridge of the year. View of the bridge from the Main Street in New Albany On February 5, 2009, a fifteen container coal barge lost power and was pushed downstream by the current and struck the bridge's central pier. The Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) closed the bridge for several hours while it was inspected for damage. When no damage was found, the bridge was reopened later the same day. Closure of 2011‚Äì2012 On September 9, 2011, Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels ordered the bridge closed. This was done after construction crews found cracks in the main load-bearing structural element. Experts from INDOT, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC), the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and private engineering firms and academic institutions participated in determining the severity of this crack and others found on the bridge, and determine whether the bridge could be saved. It was initially feared the bridge would remain closed from several months to up to 3 years, and that the entire span would have to be either completely replaced or extensively renovated before the Sherman Minton Bridge could reopen to traffic. However, engineers determined the crack that initiated the bridge closure dated back to the bridge's original construction in the 1960s, but had not been discovered until the summer of 2011 because another structural component was covering it. On September 23, 2011, Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear and US Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood announced the 2.5-inch crack has been repaired, but the bridge would remain closed until crews completed an inspection of the remainder of the bridge.\\"LAHOOD: One Sherman Minton Bridge crack repaired; no timetable for re-opening\\", WDRB-TV, September 23, 2011 Five to seven additional cracks were discovered during the following inspection in welded areas in a load-bearing steel beam. \\"The fissures were discovered in a type of steel frequently used in the 1950s and 1960s that is now known to be susceptible to cracking. ...\\". This necessitated the bridge being closed for an extended period of time for repairs. Repairs cost $20 million and ultimately took four months to complete. In a news release from the Indiana Department of Transportation, dated October 18, 2011, Governor Mitch Daniels announced that Louisville based Hall Contracting of Kentucky had been awarded the repairs contract in the amount of $13.9 million. A time frame of 135 work days was announce with an incentive of $100,000 per day to finish early. Likewise, a penalty of $100,000 would be deducted from the contract payments for each day over. Repair cost were covered by the Federal Highway Administration, who announced on September 30, 2011 that it would contribute 25% of the cost, with the remaining 75% being equally split between Indiana and Kentucky. Floyd's Knobs. Louisville International Airport is in the distance. The contract attached of reinforcing steel plating along both sides of the bridge ties spanning . The repairs along with regular maintenance increased the bridge's safety and reliability and extend its useful life by at least 20 years. Repairs were completed and the Sherman Minton Bridge reopened at 11:50 pm on February 17, 2012. Construction showing temporary support falsework. Potential impact of tolling I-65 bridges The bridge has been expected to see major increases in traffic following the completion of the Ohio River Bridges Project at the end of 2016. The project included repurposing the John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge, which previously carried I-65 in both directions, for southbound traffic only; building the new Abraham Lincoln Bridge for northbound I-65 traffic; and building the Lewis and Clark Bridge to connect I-265 in the two states. The two I-65 crossings and the I-265 bridge are tolled to pay for the project, leaving the Sherman Minton as the only free interstate-quality river crossing in the Louisville area. One consultant who worked on a transportation study for the Kentucky government predicted that traffic on the Sherman Minton would increase by nearly 40% once tolling on the other bridges started. Construction The bridge is a double- deck configuration‚Äîwestbound traffic from Kentucky to Indiana travels on the upper deck of the bridge, while eastbound traffic from Indiana into Kentucky travels on the lower deck of the bridge. It is of similar construction to the Hernando de Soto Bridge in Memphis, Tennessee (but the de Soto Bridge is single-deck).

Hip-hop fashion generally was the most popular among young people of all sexes, followed by the retro inspired indie look later in the decade. Those usually 25 years of age and older adopted a dressy casual style which was popular throughout the decade. Globalization also influenced the decade's clothing trends, with the incorporation of Middle Eastern and Asian dress into mainstream European, American and Australasian fashion. Furthermore, eco-friendly and ethical clothing, such as recycled fashions and fake fur, were prominent in the decade. In the early 2000s, many mid and late 1990s fashions remained fashionable around the globe, while simultaneously introducing newer trends. The later years of the decade saw a large-scale revival of clothing designs primarily from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. General trends High fashion The leading fashion designers between 2000‚Äì09 included the late Alexander McQueen, Vera Wang, Christian Louboutin, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Vivienne Westwood,Barcelona 2012 . Thebrandery.com. and Karl Lagerfeld. The rise of fast fashion The early to mid-2000s saw a rise in the consumption of fast fashion: affordable off-the-peg high street clothing based on the latest high fashion designs. With its low cost appeal driven by trends straight off the runway, fast fashion was a significant factor in the fashion industry's growth. As affordable clothing became even more important in the entrance to the new age, brands had to find a way to keep up with their consumer's new spending habits. During the year 1999, department stores such as Macy's, J.C. Penney, Kohl's and more had sales totaling $230 billion. In the years that followed, that number began to fall. By the early 2000s the rise of online retail and in-store fast fashion caused department store sales to dwindle in sales in the wake of new styles being offered quicker than ever before by retailers. Retail giants of the new millennium included H&M;, Forever 21, and Zara. Notably, the retailer Target found major success in collaborating with various fashion designers for affordable designer pieces available for the average consumer. This trend in fast fashion allowed shoppers to own designer items at lower prices, also allowing the acceptance and production of copycat styles. Designers noticed their designs were being knocked-off, and decided to do something about it. In 2004, the retail giant H&M;, a master in rolling out fast fashion, collaborated with fashion designer Karl Lagerfield to introduce a one-time collection which proved to be a huge success, as women flocked to H&M; stores to own a piece of the designer's 30 selections available in the collection. Stores such as Wet Seal and American Apparel are said to be \\"American precursors to the fast fashion empire\\". As well as the retail stores Hollister, Abercrombie & Fitch and possibly on a much smaller scale Limited Too, but in the end, stores like Forever 21 were better able to stay on top of the retail game. Ethics The ethics of fast fashion has been the topic of numerous debates and questioning of business practices. Producing fashion at such fast rates involves less than secure worker conditions, and non-livable wages for the laborers. It also involves a lot of waste. Americans throw out 14 million tons of clothing a year, with the help of fast fashion. Retailers like Forever 21 and H&M; have come under fire, not only for their wasteful fast fashion practices that have grown steadily since the beginning of 2000, but for the involvement of cheap labor. The appeal of fast fashion lies in the copying of higher end brands; however, after something is no longer trendy it is on to the next, leaving clothes to go to waste, and workers to continue to live on unlivable wages.  Socio- economics and the logo purse  The 2000s saw social classes broken down and restructured so specifically that they became meaningless, and anyone could transcend the typical stereotypes of class with what they owned. In high fashion, there was less of a top-down approach to fashion, and designers were becoming increasingly inspired by pop culture and street style. These two factors combined led to the popularity of the designer logo that was seen boldly printed on all types of clothing, but specifically purses. A logo purse was a unifier, worn by celebrities, models, and the middle-class shopper. Many of these brands had outlet stores, so the logo purse was available to even more people. Having the same branded purse as many others was a form of escapism, it was a unifying factor that let people forget how much money they made, and instead focus on being like the rest. The rise of fast fashion helped people afford a designer bag, since they could save money on the rest of their wardrobe. As the decade went on, it became increasingly popular to mix designer and fast fashion clothing. People were more concerned with looking the part and fitting into a certain style tribe than who was making the clothes. Women's fashion Early 2000s (2000‚Äì03) Aaliyah wearing a bandana and hoop earrings in 2000 =Y2K fashion= *When the 2000s kicked off, the fashion was profoundly influenced by technology. Around the year 2000, there was a monochromatic futuristic approach to fashion, with metallics, shiny blacks, heavy use of gray, straps, and buckles becoming commonplace. This was called \\"Y2K fashion\\". The apparel was made to be as dark, reflective, technological, and as sexy as possible. When the original iPod was introduced in 2001, the earbuds, as well as the gadget itself, became something of an accessory for early adopters. *Particular pieces of Y2K clothing included mesh tops, wraparound sunglasses, wireframe rectangle glasses, box-pleated skirts, handkerchief tops (often in a metallic pattern such as silver or gold for a disco feel), satin skirts, leather skirts, concert t-shirts with rhinestones, sparkling shoes, halter tops, sequinned pants (popularized by Peter Morrissey), and embroidered and sequinned tops (inspired by Easton Pearson), along with the famous pearl printed black cocktail dress by Karen Walker, which was successful worldwide. *In the year 2000, some of the casual women's and girl's fashion trends were oversized sunglasses, aviator sunglasses, oversized hoop earrings, jeans worn for numerous occasions (such as mid-rise, boot-cut, fabric accents down the sides, fabric accents sewn into the flares, lace-up sides and tie-dye), wedge flip flops, hot pants, denim jackets, chunky sweaters, pashmina scarves, Skechers, belly shirts, and tube tops. =Casual chic= *In Africa, Europe, North America, East Asia, South America, and Oceania, the early 2000s saw the continuation of many mid and late 1990s fashions due to the continued influence of teen pop stars such as Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, such as the military look, while introducing newer more vaguely dystopian post modern trends. From 2001 onwards, women wore long-sleeved shirts with bell sleeves, cowl-neck tops, crop tops, Burberry, hoodies, flare jeans, hip- huggers, low rise pants, white jeans, whale tails, cargo pants (especially ones made out of silk, satin, and velvet) hip-hop inspired sweatpants, daisy dukes, thong underwear, and solid bright-colored tights. *9/11 and the mortgage crisis of 2001 impacted fashion by bringing in a new wave of conservatism. This created a rise in denim, the American fabric of the working person. Jeans became acceptable in every situation, from the supermarket to the red carpet. It was a slow shift to conservatism, seen in how jeans started low-rise in reflection of the sexy Y2K style and moved through various waistlines and leg widths. As mentioned with the social classes, logos became a form of stability and comfort in fashion. There was a sense of unity in the country because all kinds of people were buying the same brands and sporting the same logos. *Perhaps in reaction to the streamlined, futuristic, outer space-themed Y2K styles of the year 2000, distressed denim became popular in America from 2001‚Äì08. Pants became lower waisted and significantly more flared than they were previously, and often featured elaborate embroidery rather than the utilitarian, no-frills style of before. In the UK, it was popular for women to wear skirts over trousers, floral print shift dresses, and colors like black, purple and pink. Big, chunky shoes and sandals were popular, with thick wedge heels and imitation leather straps decorated with floral embroidery, while previously successful sneaker brands like Skechers declined in popularity. =First-wave 1980s revival= *Although the 1980s fashion revival was not in full swing until 2001, the first movement had started in the late 1990s and continued into the early 2000s. This first wave primarily focused on the early 1980s. Such trends that emerged during this period included denim miniskirts, ripped \\"distressed\\" jeans, denim jackets, tracksuits, trenchcoats (often in pleather), puffy jackets (revived by Hip-Hop artists), and preppy polo shirts with popped collars. These remained popular until about 2008 when the revival of late 1980s fashions occurred. *Overall, European and American women and girls wore low-top sneakers, such as Skechers, Heelys, Adidas shoes, Reebok shoes, and Nike, as well as knee-high boots with spiked heels and pointed toes (or conversely, thick low heels and round or square toes). Popular accessories of the early 2000s include white belts, aviator sunglasses, trucker hats, hoop earrings, block heeled mary janes, leg warmers (worn with mini skirts), ugg boots, flip-flops, jelly shoes, lace-up sandals, newsboy caps, ponchos, and jelly bracelets.Mikkelson, Barbara (2003). \\"Sex Bracelets\\". snopes.com. Retrieved 8 June 2014. = Sex and the City = The American television series Sex and the City impacted how women cared about fashion and how they shopped. The show depicted women as empowered consumers, each with their own independent styles that shopped based on what they wanted, not what they were told to wear. The main characters became fashion icons, inspiring window displays, fashion lines, magazines, and women globally. Carrie Bradshaw, the main character, is credited for making Manolo Blahnik a household name from her obsession with the Spanish designer's high-heeled shoes. Trends inspired by the show include stilettos, designer handbags (with two episodes centered around the latest \\"It bag\\"), large fabric flowers, and berets.

Due to the popularity of the Pirates of the Caribbean films, and a resurgence of interest in 1980s fashion, teen and college age women frequently wore cavalier boots, Greek fisherman's caps, jewelry with anchor motifs, leather look drainpipe trousers, frilly satin poet shirts, sashes, harem pants, braided hussar jackets, and dress uniforms with epaulets inspired by female pop stars, British indie/garage rock band The Libertines and MCR's The Black Parade. =African clothing= *Throughout the mid and late 2000s, women's clothing in Africa comprised either brightly colored kente cloth or mudcloth traditional dress such as the boubou, pagne, and doek, or secondhand Western dress donated and distributed by British and American charities. Mitumba clothing had been imported into Tanzania and Kenya since the economic liberalisation of the early 1990s, and was more desirable than newly made Chinese textiles due to its higher quality of construction and recognisable brand labels.

Men's fashion Early 2000s (2000‚Äì03) =Y2K fashion= * At the very beginning of the decade, the excitement of entering the new millennium had become evident in fashion in the first couple of years, although this was only prominent in nightclub and \\"going out\\" attire.

Cosmopolitan.com. 2000s beauty trends Hairstyles =Women= Zo√´ Bell in 2006 sporting a medium length hairstyle and blended highlights In the early 2000s, women's hair was often long and straight. The early 2000s featured \\"zig-zag partings\\", in which the hairline is parted in a zig-zag fashion. Hair lengths varied from below the earlobes at the shortest to just below the shoulders at the longest. From 1995 until 2008 highlights and lowlights made of blonde, red, and light brown went mainstream. In 2000, highlights were soft and subtle for a sun-kissed look. In 2002 bold and unblended highlights called \\"chunky highlights\\" burst onto the scene. This trend was kickstarted by Kelly Clarkson during her time on American Idol, lasting until 2006. The early 2000s also continued the Farrah Fawcett hairstyle revival of the late 1990s. Crimped hair was popular in the early and mid 2000s. For black women, cornrows, dreadlocks and curly weaves were popular until the late 2000s, when toned-down versions of the Afro, Jheri curl and short pixie cuts were popularized by artists like Janet Jackson and Rihanna. Another popular hairstyle throughout the decade was the braid, rejuvenated by the likes of Alicia Keys and Lauren Conrad. Throughout the early and middle years braids and plaits would often be meticulously put in intricate patterns and would purposely be styled as a way to blend in better with women's clothing styles. In the mid 2000s, many women favored the bob haircut, as well as its longer version, the long bob or \\"the lob\\". By the late 00's, it became unfashionable to center-part one's hair, and the side-swept Bangs of the 1980s made a comeback. In the late 2000s, dark haired women (and even light-haired ones) favored the jet black hair, as worn by Katy Perry or Amy Winehouse with her trademark beehive hairstyle. Textured hair with volume, natural wavy hair, and the bob cut became popular from 2007 onwards in both Britain and the USA. In 2009, many women sought to imitate the hairstyle Kate Gosselin had that year, briefly bringing back blended highlights into the mainstream. This look ended up only being a fad. Other popular late 2000s trends included Headbands, headwraps and Scrunchies, side ponytails, and braiding on one side of the head. =Men= For European men aged 25‚Äì40, shorter hair styles that usually took the form of a quiff were fashionable in the early 2000s, as well as spiked hair and fauxhawks for men aged 18‚Äì30. Dark-haired young British men often had dyed-blonde weaves and streaks until the late 2000s when a natural hair color became the norm again. A common haircut among American men and boys was the frosted spiky hair popularized by boybands and pop punk bands from 1997 through 2004. Meanwhile, the crew cut and buzzcut remained popular among American and Middle Eastern men from the mid 1990s until the 2010s. Long, shaggy Mod or surfer hair became popular among many young men between 2003‚Äì06 in the UK as many bands moved away from punk rock and rap metal in favor of a 1960s inspired indie or garage rock sound pioneered by groups like The Strokes, Jet, The Killers, The Hives, The Vines, Coldplay, and The White Stripes. These hairstyles gradually replaced the shaggy, grown out curtained hair popular since the late 1990s among American celebrities like Tom Cruise, Jim Adkins of Jimmy Eat World, Alex Band, Jason Wade, Mehmet Okur and Hanno M√∂tt√∂l√§. By the late 2000s, many young British men opted for a clean-cut 1950s inspired hairstyle, kept in place with pomade. Shaved and bald hairstyles along with beards, moustaches, stubble, sideburns, and the goatee became popular in Europe and North America in reaction to the effeminate early and mid 2000s metrosexual look, with charitable events like Movember further increasing their acceptability.\\"Marksimpson.com 'Here come the mirror men' by Mark Simpson ‚Äì first usage of the word 'metrosexual'\\" Mark Simpson . Retrieved 18 October 2008. =Children and teenagers= Swedish teenagers wearing typical late 2000s male hairstyles, 2008 Wings haircut worn by singer Justin Bieber in 2009. For boys, short haircuts such as the quiff, the buzzcut, curtains, crew cut, and Caesar cut were popular in the early 2000s. Girls favored straight hair extensions and chunky highlights. It also became fashionable to sport curly hair with a \\"zig-zag\\" side parting and blended highlights around 2002/03. Back in the late 90s and early 2000s, butterfly hair clips and crimped hair became extremely popular for preteens and teenage girls. In the mid 2000s, longer hair on teenage boys became popular in the UK and America, including the wings haircut, influenced by the 1960s Mod subculture, and British indie pop stars. Hairstyles among teenage girls experienced little change, being largely the same as they were in the early 2000s. Curly hair became less popular in Britain, while straight hair grew more dominant. Highlights remained popular, as well as extensions. Hair was often tied into a ponytail and incorporated long bangs or a fringe. In 2009, the androgynous Harajuku inspired scene hairstyles (often dyed bright colors) and eyeliner were popular among girls and boys alike: first in Japan, and later in the US and Europe.\\"Metropolis ‚Äì Tokyo feature stories: Face to face with Harajuku ‚Äì Pictures of Japanese youth\\" Metropolis.co.jp Retrieved 2008-10-18. As an alternative to the scene hairstyles, many teenage girls in the US and Australasia opted for a preppy hairstyle that involved long, straight hair, side-swept and regular bangs and a side part, while boys wore basic skater hair. Many girls wore headbands, headwraps and 80s inspired scrunchies with either a side ponytail or french braid falling over one shoulder. In between 2006 and 2008, Middle Eastern teenage boys in Australia, namely those of Lebanese descent, acquired the high and tight haircut. Some tend to had the cut with a mullet. Makeup and cosmetic trends The year 2000, was based on the glittery Y2K inspired makeup of the late 1990s. With the turn of the millennium, the idea was for women to capture a futuristic, space-age style. With makeup including bronze specks for a metallic shine with ecstatic colors. An alternative for those who did not like metallics was a purple and brown color scheme. Lip gloss was more popular than lipstick among both women and girls. By the spring/summer season of 2001, this look took a backseat in favor of a more low-maintenance, natural style that showed off ones features. However, the glittery looks continued to be popular. In 2002, mineral makeup broke into the mainstream with Bare Minerals, a product of Bare Escentuals. This fueled the trend for natural looking makeup, and became the standard of the 2000s. By 2004, the glittery looks had disappeared. By around 2005/06, retro-styled makeup from the 1940s had made a comeback, such as bright red lips and cat eyes. In the mid and late 2000s, lip gloss remained popular, and the \\"Smoky Eye\\" emerged, with more emphasis on eyeliner, mascara, and eyeshadow. Another emerging trend was a more natural \\"less is more\\" approach to makeup around the same time. Also around the second half of the decade, there was an increasing amount of emphasis on the perfection of complexions, with illuminators and shimmer products becoming must-have items. In the late 2000s, there was a craze for fake eyelashes, started by Lady Gaga. This resulted in lash tinting, lash extensions, lash embroidery, and fake lashes. Makeup styles generally became simpler and more individualistic with the rise of How-to YouTube videos. Body care and grooming The year 2000 featured natural-colored skin as the most desirable, and did not feature many body care trends other than the rise of hair removal, teeth whitening, and anti-aging creams. In the summer of 2001, the sunless tanning trend broke into the mainstream for all genders, prompted by Jennifer Lopez and Christina Aguilera. This included both self-tanners and spray tans. Cosmetic contacts also became more widespread among all genders this year. In 2002, botox was approved for public use and became hugely popular with women and men. By 2009, fake tanning had gone out of style in favor a pale complexion, inspired by the Twilight film. The 2000s, continued the unisex trend of bikini waxing which had started in the 1990s. Although waxing in general had been popular among women for several years, it was in the 1990s that complete male body hair removal went mainstream. Being considered suggestive and indecent in the 90s, male waxing became ubiquitous as a result of the metrosexual trend in the early and mid 2000s. Also during this time, it was popular to have a completely clean-shaven face, as if to make one look underage. Male hair removal declined in the late 2000s. Tattoos and piercings Navel piercings were popular from 1995 all the way to the mid-2000s. The 2000s continued the trend of tattoos and piercings among all genders which had begun during the 1990s. Commonplace tattoos in Europe, Australasia, Hong Kong, and North America included tramp stamps and tribal arm tattoos from the early to mid 2000s, and Hindu Sanskrit or Chinese Kanji words from 2007‚Äì10. Old school tattoos depicting hearts, skulls, flowers or female figures were considered unfashionable and unsophisticated for much of the decade, especially among women. However, these made a comeback in 2008 at the same time Ed Hardy accessories and the pin-up girl look were becoming popular. In the early 2000s, navel piercings reached their peak, as did tongue rings. Other popular piercings throughout the decade include labret piercings, nostril piercings, nipple piercings, and eyebrow piercings. Piercings and tattoos reached the height of their popularity during the mid 2000s but remained a common sight among young people well into the 2010s.

The section of Route 85 between Route 82 in Salem and Interstate 95 (I-95) in Waterford is a major thoroughfare that serves traffic between the Hartford and New London areas. This section travels through what is known as the Route 11 Corridor, named for the unfinished expressway that was to run parallel to Route 85 in this area. Currently, the Route 11 expressway ends abruptly in Salem, and all traffic is forced to exit and directed onto Route 85 (via Route 82).ConnDOT map of Salem Route description Route 85 begins as a four-lane urban arterial road at U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in New London, with junctions with I-95 and I-395 in Waterford. Route 85 continues north through the towns of Montville and Salem as a 2-lane rural arterial road up to the junction with Route 82. The road continues further north into the towns of Colchester, Hebron, and Bolton as a collector road (with arterial sections near the Route 2 and Route 16 junctions). There is a brief overlap with Route 16 in Colchester. Route 85 ends in Bolton at US 6 and US 44 with a partial interchange with I-384 just before its terminus. Route 85 is designated Governor's Road from its southern terminus to the intersection with Route 2 in Colchester. History The section of Route 85 south of Colchester can be traced to the 19th century Hartford and New London Turnpike. This portion of the former turnpike was designated as State Highway 102 in 1922, when state highways were first signed in Connecticut. The northward continuation from Colchester to Hebron was assigned as State Highway 366. Modern Route 85 was established in the 1932 state highway renumbering from old Highways 102 and 366, with an extension north via Bolton center to Route 83 in Manchester (using Campmeeting Road and Charter Oak Street). In 1950, the northern terminus was moved to its current location at US 6 (along former SR 807). The northern terminus was moved back to its original location in 1954, then shifted again to its current location in 1963. The original northern end became SR 534.Connecticut Routes, Route 85 Junction list References External links 085 Category:Transportation in New London County, Connecticut Category:Transportation in Tolland County, Connecticut ","title":"Connecticut Route 85"},{"id":"4251093","title":"Daydream (Wallace Collection song)"},{"id":"4251098","text":"In Hinduism, Rishabha is one of the twenty four avatars of Vishnu in the Bhagavata Purana. Some scholars state that this avatar is same as the first Tirthankara of Jainism. Rishabha is also found in Vedic literature, where it means the \\"bull\\" and is an epithet for Rudra (Shiva). According to John E. Cort and other scholars, there is a considerable overlap between Jain and Hindu Vaishnava traditions in western parts of India, with both religions adopting each other's sacred figures such as Jain texts adopting Vishnu avatars Krishna and Rama, while Hindu texts adopted Rishabha and his son Bharata.Padmanabh S.

This test is performed on a universal testing machine (tensile testing machine or tensile tester) with a three-point or four-point bend fixture.The main advantage of a three-point flexural test is the ease of the specimen preparation and testing. However, this method has also some disadvantages: the results of the testing method are sensitive to specimen and loading geometry and strain rate.  Testing method  The test method for conducting the test usually involves a specified test fixture on a universal testing machine. Details of the test preparation, conditioning, and conduct affect the test results. The sample is placed on two supporting pins a set distance apart.

The fracture toughness of a specimen can also be determined using a three-point flexural test. The stress intensity factor at the crack tip of a single edge notch bending specimen is : \\\\begin{align} K_{\\\\rm I} & = \\\\frac{4P}{B}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{W}}\\\\left[1.6\\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{W}\\\\right)^{1/2} - 2.6\\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{W}\\\\right)^{3/2} \\\\+ 12.3\\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{W}\\\\right)^{5/2} \\\\right.\\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\qquad \\\\left.- 21.2\\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{W}\\\\right)^{7/2} + 21.8\\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{W}\\\\right)^{9/2} \\\\right] \\\\end{align} where P is the applied load, B is the thickness of the specimen, a is the crack length, and W is the width of the specimen. In a three-point bend test, a fatigue crack is created at the tip of the notch by cyclic loading. The length of the crack is measured. The specimen is then loaded monotonically. A plot of the load versus the crack opening displacement is used to determine the load at which the crack starts growing. This load is substituted into the above formula to find the fracture toughness K_{Ic}.

Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 18 May 2013 Ceolwulf's brother, Coenred, seized the Northumbrian throne in 716. Coenred ruled for two years when Osric, the last of the House of Aethelric, claimed the throne and ruled for ten years. In 729, shortly before his death, Osric nominated Ceolwulf as his successor. He consulted the Venerable Bede for advice on important matters. While praising Ceolwulf's piety, Bede also expressed some reservations regarding Ceolwulf's ability to rule. Ceolwulf was a man with deep monastic interests and perhaps little suited to affairs of state. Bede dedicated his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (History of the English Church) to Ceolwulf in 731. The beginning of his reign was disturbed by factions and rebellion, and that same year he was forcibly seized by his enemies and compelled to receive the monastic tonsure.Stanton, Richard. A Menology of England and Wales, Burns & Oates, 1887, p. 20 He was deposed for a short period but quickly restored. The details of the attempted coup are unclear.

Built after 1100 by Henry I, the castle played a prominent part in both the civil war of the Anarchy and the First Barons' War. The castle was significantly extended in stone, although the final plan of the castle remains uncertain. Henry III of England besieged the castle in 1224 following a disagreement with Falkes de Breaut√©; the siege lasted eight weeks and involved an army of as many as 2,700 soldiers with equipment drawn from across England. After the surrender of the castle, the king ordered its destruction. Although partially refortified in the 17th century during the English Civil War, the castle remained a ruin until the urban expansion in Bedford during the 19th century, when houses were built across much of the property. Today only part of the motte still stands, forming part of an archaeological park built on the site between 2007 and 2009.  History   Early history (1100‚Äì1153)  Bedford Castle was probably built after 1100 by Henry I in the town of Bedford, overlooking the River Great Ouse. The castle was constructed inside the town itself, and many of the older Anglo-Saxon streets had to be destroyed and diverted to make room for it, leaving a permanent mark in the formal grid system.Creighton, pp.40, 141. The castle was built in a motte and bailey design and was probably much smaller than the later castle, just consisting of the motte and the inner bailey.Baker, p.18; Albion Archaeology, p.32. By the early 12th century the castle was controlled by the royal castellan, Simon de Beauchamp, the son of Hugh de Beauchamp who had helped conquer England in 1066. The borough of Bedford: Castle and barony, A History of the County of Bedford: Volume 3 (1912), pp. 9-15, accessed 7 July 2011; King, p.83. Contemporaries described the castle around this time as \\"completely ramparted around with an immense earthen bank and ditch, girt about with a wall strong and high, strengthened with a strong and unshakeable keep\\".Bedford Castle, Bedford Borough Council, accessed 3 July 2011. Simon died in 1137, and King Stephen agreed that Simon's daughter should marry Hugh the Pauper and that the castle would be given to Hugh, in exchange for Stephen giving Miles compensatory honours and gifts.King, p.83; Bradbury (2009), p.63. Miles and Payn de Beauchamp, the children of Simon's brother, Robert de Beauchamp, declared that the castle was rightfully Miles' and refused to hand it over to Hugh.King, p.83. A reconstruction of how Bedford Castle may possibly have appeared in 1224; A ‚Äì inner bailey; B ‚Äì keep; C ‚Äì moat, fed by the River Great Ouse; D ‚Äì outer bailey; E ‚Äì gatehouse Meanwhile, civil war had broken out in England between King Stephen and the Empress Matilda, resulting in a period of chaos known as the Anarchy. Matilda's uncle, David I of Scotland, invaded England during 1137 in support of her claim.Harsthorne, p.2. Although Miles de Beauchamp declared himself in support of Stephen, the king decided to retake Bedford Castle before marching north. Stephen formed an army to besiege Bedford Castle but Miles gained advance warning of the attack and took in considerable supplies, preparing for a long siege. Stephen was unable to storm the castle and left a force under the command of Hugh to starve it into submission whilst he marched north to tackle the Scots invasion.Hartshorne, p.2. Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester, intervened in an attempt to produce a negotiated solution. Henry reached an agreement whereby after five weeks, the castle finally surrendered; the garrison were allowed to leave peacefully but the castle was handed over to the king.Hartshorne, p.2; King, p.83. The deal struck by Miles and Henry appears to have left the surrounding estates in the hands of the Beauchamps, however, and in 1141 Miles returned and retook the castle itself, although no details are available as to how he achieved this. The borough of Bedford: Castle and barony, A History of the County of Bedford: Volume 3 (1912), pp. 9-15, accessed 7 July 2011; King, p.224. Miles subsequently supported the Empress, and in 1146, Ranulf, the Earl of Chester and temporarily on the side of the king, attacked and took the town of Bedford, but was unable to take the castle, which continued to be controlled by Miles until his death several years later. The borough of Bedford: Castle and barony, A History of the County of Bedford: Volume 3 (1912), pp. 9-15, accessed 7 July 2011; Hartshorne, p.2; Bradbury (2009), p.152. Towards the end of the war, Bedford Castle may have been attacked again; Henry II, during the final year of the conflict in 1153, marched through Bedford and documentary evidence shows damage to the town at this time. Historians are divided as to whether the castle was besieged at the same time.Bradbury (2009), p.178, 182; Baker, p.17; Warren, p.50.  Mid-medieval period (1153‚Äì1224)  The medieval lime kiln preserved as part of the archaeological park at Bedford Castle Early in 1215 tensions grew between King John and a rebel faction of his barons, which would lead to the First Barons' War.Pounds, p.115. The rebel barons attempted to besiege Northampton Castle; unsuccessful, they turned to Bedford Castle but the castle withstood the attack and they moved south to London. Bedford was held at the time by William de Beauchamp but his loyalty came into question and he rebelled against John.Pounds, p.116. Falkes de Breaut√©, a key Anglo-Norman leader loyal to John, resisted and seized Bedford Castle back for John in 1216.Pounds, p.119. In return John gave Falkes the Honour of Bedford, and in practical terms the castle as well, although it is unclear whether he gave Falkes the role of castellan or ownership of the castle itself. As the war continued, Falkes took control of Plympton, Christchurch and Carisbrooke castles, whilst continuing to hold onto Bedford.Pounds, p.117. After the death of King John in 1216 the war turned against the rebel barons and the royalist faction, including Falkes, was able to restore his son, the young Henry III to power in England. After the war, Falkes made Bedford Castle his headquarters and he expanded it considerably, resulting in what David Baker has described as a \\"major refortification\\".Baker, p.17. Falkes destroyed the neighbouring churches of St Paul's and St Cuthbert's to make space for a new bailey, reusing the stone for the castle.Pounds; Baker, p.17; Liddiard, p.17. The exact form of the castle after this expansion remains uncertain. The castle appears to have been quadrangular, with the western edge running along the rear of the modern High Street and the northern edge running along the modern roads of Ram Yard and Castle Lane.Albion Archaeology, p.32. The castle had a new barbican; an outer and an inner bailey, with the inner bailey in the south-east corner, protected by an internal ditch and a stone-lined palisade; further stone lined ditches lay around the castle; and a new keep was built on the motte.Baker, p.17; Brown, p.161. Brown suspects that the new keep was probably a shell keep with a tower, similar to those built at Launceston or Bungay. The stone-lined palisades and ditches built at Bedford were very unusual in England ‚Äì their closest equivalent are those found at Skenfrith Castle in Wales.Baker, p.21. The castle had a postern watergate facing towards the river, and a great hall within the inner bailey in the middle, at least 13 m (43 feet) wide and 40 m (131 feet) long.Baker, pp.18-21. There was possibly a large stone gatehouse positioned on the outer bailey wall. A mound in the north-east corner of the castle probably supported a large tower. = Siege of 1224 = Mangonel shot, discovered at the castle in the 1970s and probably dating from the 1224 siegeAmt, p.111. Henry III decided that Bedford Castle should be returned to its original owner, William de Beauchamp, and became increasingly frustrated with Falkes' refusal to do so; matters came to a head when Falkes' castellans imprisoned Henry of Braybrooke, a royal judge who was hearing law cases against Falkes.Brown, p.160. When Falkes refused to release the judge, Henry mobilised an army, supported by the Church in the form of Stephen Langton, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and advanced to Bedford.Brown, p.160; Bradbury (1992), p.140. Falkes had left the castle, along with around eighty men, in charge of his brother, William de Breaut√©, who refused to surrender it to the king.Brown, p.160; Liddiard, p.92. Falkes was probably hoping that if the castle held on long enough, his efforts to convince Pope Honorius III to intervene against Henry would succeed. The Archbishop excommunicated William and the siege began. The siege of Bedford Castle required huge resources.Brown, p.162. Siege engines were brought from Lincoln, Northampton and Oxfordshire, while carpenters built others on site using timber from Northamptonshire; ropes from London, Cambridge and Southampton; hides from Northampton and tallow from London. Labourers from across Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire were gathered by the relevant sheriffs, and miners from Hereford and the Forest of Dean.Brown, p.163. Crossbow bolts were ordered from a depot at Corfe Castle and from the provinces; 43,300 crossbow bolts are known to have been ordered by the king.Brown, p.163; Amt, pp.112-3. Local trees were cut down, and stone quarrying begun to provide ammunition for siege engines.Amt, pp.108, 111. Tents and pavilions for the King were sent from London along with supplies of luxury foods and wine, also for the King. In total, Henry's wage bill for the siege came to ¬£1,311; it is uncertain exactly how large Henry's army was, but potentially there were between 1,600 and 2,700 men present at any one time.Carpenter, p.364; Amt, pp.115-6. To support the siege, Langton instructed his bishops to mobilise one man from every 24 hectares (60 acres) of land they owned and levied a special tax on the churches' estates.Bradbury (1992), p.140; Carpenter, p.364. A near- contemporary sketch by Matthew Paris of the keep and tower of Bedford Castle (l) during the 1224 siege, and the execution of the garrison after their surrender (r) With these resources, Henry erected a number of siege engines around the castle; one probable trebuchet and two mangonels were set up to the east of the castle; two mangonels were placed on the west side, to attack the keep, and one mangonel on both the north and south sides. Two siege-castles were established to observe the occupants of the castle. William was confident, however, that either his brother would return and relieve the siege, or that the pope would intervene, and held on despite the artillery attacks. The losses in the royal army began to mount; chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall suggests that seven knights, and over 200 soldiers and labourers were killed as the siege dragged on.Brown, pp.160-1. Bedford Castle finally fell through a sequence of four attacks.Brown, p.161. Royal forces first captured the barbican and then stormed the outer bailey, seizing most of the castle's supplies but taking considerable losses. Miners, operating under the protection of a \\"cat\\", then gained access to the inner bailey by collapsing part of the wall.Liddiard, p.92. Finally, on 14 August, the miners attacked the keep itself, lighting a fire under the walls, cracking the stone and filling the building with smoke. The female members of the household, including Falkes' wife, and Henry de Braybrooke were released, the royal standard was raised over the tower, and the next day William and the garrison surrendered. A discussion ensued about the fate of the garrison; near contemporary accounts suggest that the prisoners asked the Archbishop for assistance, but that this was declined. Henry then had all the male members of the garrison hanged, except for three knights who agreed to join the military order of the Knights Templar.Liddiard, p.92; Powicke, p.27; Amt, p.114. Three days after the fall of Bedford Castle, the Pope wrote a letter demanding that Henry cease his campaign against Falkes, but this intervention had occurred far too late to be of use.Liddiard, p.93. Alexander de Stavenby, the Bishop of Coventry, convinced Falkes to surrender after the fall of the castle; he handed over his remaining castles at Plympton and Storgursey and was absolved by Langton, going into exile shortly afterwards.Brown, p.164; Carpenter, p.367. Historian R. Brown has noted that the 1224 siege of Bedford Castle was remarkable in that the castle's garrison was able to hold out against \\"the concentrated military resources of the whole kingdom\\" for an impressive eight weeks.Brown, p.164. David Carpenter argues that the fall of Bedford castle \\"concluded the triumph of central government\\" over the previously uncontrollable forces of the local barons.Carpenter, pp.369-70.  Later history (13‚Äì19th centuries)  Bedford Castle in John Speed's map of 1611, showing the motte and remaining fragments of the bailey walls After the siege Henry III ordered the castle to be dismantled and labourers filled in the ditches and halved the height of the stone walls.Bradbury (1992), p.141. William de Beauchamp was forbidden to rebuild the castle, and instead built an unfortified house in the inner bailey. St Paul's and St Cuthbert's churches were rebuilt in 1224 using stone from the castle.Albion Archaeology, pp.33-4. The sudden availability of cheap stone led to the repaving of many of the town streets in Bedford in 1224.Albion Archaeology, p.37, citing Godber, p.54. Local tradition suggests that the first stone bridge at Bedford, the Great Bridge, was built using stone from the castle.Albion Archaeology, p.43. By 1361 the castle site was described as \\"a void plot of old enclosed by walls\\" and seems to have been derelict for most of the medieval period.Albion Archaeology, pp.32, 38; Bedford Castle, Bedford Borough Council, accessed 3 July 2011. The antiquarian John Leland visited the site in the 16th century, and noted that the castle was \\"now clean down\\".Thompson, p.171. The early 17th century mapmaker John Speed produced a map of Bedford in 1611, showing the motte and a fragment of bailey wall still standing on an otherwise vacant site.Thompson, p.13. At the outbreak of the English Civil War, Bedford sided with Parliament; the town was temporarily captured by Prince Rupert of the Rhine in 1643 and the castle was refortified for the duration of the war.Albion Archaeology, p.18. A probable wooden fort and prison were built on the remains of the motte and defended by a hundred-man garrison.Albion Archaeology, p.46. After the war the motte became used as a bowling green until the 19th century. In 1804 the north-east tower of the castle was turned into a hexagonal building for the local militia unit.Albion Archaeology, p.53. Bedford began to spread eastwards in the late 19th century and the castle baileys became desirable property for housing; in 1851 the last parts of the barbican were destroyed to make way for the construction of cottages.Albion Archaeology, p.32; Bedford Castle, Bedford Borough Council, accessed 3 July 2011. In 2004 Bedford Borough Council commissioned artist Gary Drostle to create a mosaic map of Bedford depicting the medieval history of the town.  Modern period (20‚Äì21st centuries)  Today only the base of the motte survives at Bedford Castle, 7.5 m (25 feet) high and 49 m (161 feet) wide at the top, and is a scheduled monument. Archaeological work has been conducted to develop a better understanding of the history of the castle, although excavations are difficult because of the urban nature of the site. Excavations between 1969 and 1972 established the broad form of the castle; this was supplemented by further work in 1995‚Äì6 and another phase of excavations in 2007.Albion Archaeology, p.33; Bedford Castle, Bedfordshire HER, Heritage Gateway, accessed 9 July 2011. Following the 2007 investigations, an archaeological park was built on part of the castle site between 2007 and 2009, forming the centre of a mixed-use development of restaurants and apartments.Archaeological Park, Bedford Castle, CSA Environmental Planning, accessed 3 July 2011. The park incorporated one of the castle's lime kilns, first rediscovered in 1973, and the foundations of a hall discovered at the castle. In 2004 Bedford Borough Council commissioned artist Gary Drostle to create a mosaic map of Bedford depicting the castle and Bedford's medieval history in front of the castle mound.

Early life Duncan was born in Turriff, Aberdeenshire on 14 May 1964 to tenant farmer Jock Duncan, well known as a bothy ballad singer, and his wife Frances. Soon after Gordon's birth, Jock joined the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board and moved to Pitlochry after a brief spell in Thurso. Initially taught by his father, Gordon began his piping career at the age of 10, winning many junior competitions under the tuition of Walter Drysdale, but started to lose interest in competition piping by the age of 18, at which point he was an apprentice joiner. Career He attracted attention from folk bands, touring the US and Europe with the Tannahill Weavers, Wolfstone and Ceolbeg and became associated with Dougie MacLean, playing low whistle on his albums. He began composing soon afterwards, having travelled across Europe and been exposed to other traditions, especially Breton music. He was a very influential piper who broke the boundaries of traditional piping music. He was a member of the Vale of Atholl Pipe Band and also performed with the Atholl Highlanders, as well as being signed by Greentrax as a solo artist. Duncan created a new style of idiosyncratic bagpipe music. He also incorporated the bagpipes into a rendition of AC/DC's Thunderstruck. His work was heard at T in the Park, Celtic Connections, Celtic Colours in Canada, the Lorient festival in Brittany, where he was the two-time winner of the MacAllan Trophy and the Fleadh Cheoil in Ireland. He worked as a refuse collector and was known to scribble compositions on cigarette packets whilst at work. Compositions Duncan composed over one hundred tunes in his lifetime, with perhaps his most famous work, Andy Renwick's Ferret, being performed and recorded internationally. He arranged music for the Vale of Atholl and ScottishPower pipe bands. Death On 14 December 2005, Duncan was found dead at his home in Perthshire following a long struggle with alcoholism. His funeral was held at Pitlochry Church of Scotland and was attended by hundreds of pipers. He is survived by his mother and father, brother and two sisters, as well as his son, Gordon, and his wife, Mary. In 2007, A National Treasure concert was staged in Perth by the Gordon Duncan Memorial Trust, and for the following four years, with the BBC airing the 2011 concert. In January 2016, a gig was at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall as part of Celtic Connections. Discography He recorded three solo albums, and a further album was compiled after his death from previously recorded material. *Just for Seumas (1994) *Circular Breath (1997) *Thunderstruck (2003) *Just for Gordon (2007) References External links * Gordon Duncan Memorial Trust * (BBC Alba documentary on Gordon Duncan's life) * * Category:1964 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Scottish musicians Category:Scottish composers Category:Great Highland bagpipe players Category:Composers who committed suicide Category:Male suicides Category:The Tannahill Weavers members Category:Wolfstone members Category:People from Turriff Category:Tin whistle players ","title":"Gordon Duncan"},{"id":"4251185","text":"The aims of the FFA Football Federation Australia Hall of Fame are to celebrate and highlight the achievements of retired players and other participants who have contributed significantly to the game.

It sits just north of the River Clyde, adjacent to Parkhead, and is bounded to the south by London Road. It is now a settlement of council houses but its name derives from an 18th-century estate of that name. History The original 'Newbank House' has left no remains, but there is a fine red-sandstone 19th century Newlands Primary School in Springfield Road, near Parkhead Cross. This school was the generous gift of Lord Newlands, hence its name. Over many years, Newlands School earned a reputation for academic excellence; its dedicated teaching staff served the Newbank/Parkhead districts well and produced many children who, despite their inauspicious origins, went on to do exceptionally well in life. Architecturally, the Newbank area is notable for its solid 4-in-a-block council housesNewbank (c.1930), Virtual Mitchell which, with full bathroom facilities and their own gardens, were a substantial improvement on the older tenement flats which for generations dominated the East End. Many of the more modern Newbank tenement flats also boasted internal facilities not commonly found elsewhere. Much of the original Newbank housing, including the fine old Belvedere Hospital nearby off London Road, has been demolished. New housing, mainly individual houses in Newbank itself and modern tenements on the site of the hospital, has replaced it in the early 21st century.

It is in the south western central part of the province, near Kejimkujik National Park. It was formerly known as the Tobeatic Wildlife Management Area, and the Tobeatic Game Reserve. \\"Tobeatic\\" means Place of the Alder in the Mi'kmaq language. It contains large areas of Acadian forest. The geography is varied, consisting of wetlands, woodlands, scrublands and barrens. The landscape was shaped by the last glaciation, which left glacial barrens, erratics, drumlins, eskers, moraines, hummocks, outwash plains and kettle lakes. The Tobeatic differs from nearby Kejimkujik National Park in that some hunting and public leasing of land is allowed, and that campsites, canoe routes, and portages are not as developed or maintained. However, the Nova Scotia Department of Environment and Labour, Protected Areas Division, is in the process of opening some trails systems and retiring hunting camps. All terrain vehicle use within the reserve has also been disallowed. Along with Kejimkujik, the Tobeatic is part of the UNESCO designated Southwest Nova Biosphere Reserve. The Tobeatic Wilderness Area is made up of several geological units including the Goldenville Formation, the Halifax Formation, and Middle to Late Devonian biotite monzogranite and leucomonzogranite. Wildlife in the Tobeatic Game Reserve includes eastern moose and white-tailed deer. The area is the setting for the book The Tent Dwellers. The region has many lakes and rivers including the Shelburne, Clyde, and Tusket rivers. Archaeological research shows that the Mi‚Äôkmaq people were present in the Tobeatic at least 4500 years ago.

A house in multiple occupation (HMO), or a house of multiple occupancy, is a British English term which refers to residential properties where ‚Äòcommon areas‚Äô exist and are shared by more than one household. Most HMOs have been subdivided from larger houses designed for and occupied by one family. Some housing legislation makes a distinction between those buildings occupied mainly on long leases and those where the majority of the occupants are short-term tenants. The definition of an HMO has its origins in fire safety legislation, following a series of publicised, preventable deaths in overcrowded buildings.  Design  In HMOs, bathrooms and kitchens / kitchenettes are typically designated as common areas shared by all tenants, but contractually speaking common areas may also include stairwells, gardens and landings. Houses may be divided up into self- contained flats, bed-sitting rooms or simple lodgings. Legally compliant HMOs are characterised by a higher standing of fire proofing, after a series of deaths in overcrowded houses. According to the Campaign for Bedsit Rights, three people a week died in fires in houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) between 1985 and 1991.  History  HMOs were principally defined by the Housing Act 1985, as being \\"...a house which is occupied by persons who do not form a single household\\".Housing Act 1985, s. 345. Legislation.gov. Retrieved March 30, 2015. The Local Government and Housing Act 1989 expanded the definition to include any part of a building which: #\\"would not [ordinarily] be regarded as a house\\" and #\\"was originally constructed or subsequently adapted for occupation by a single household\\"Local Government and Housing Act 1989, s. 165(1)(c), Sch. 9 para. 44. Legislation.gov. Retrieved March 30, 2015. Both the 1985 and the 1989 Acts have since been superseded by the Housing Act 2004,Housing Act 2004, s. 266, Sch. 16. Legislation.gov. Retrieved March 30, 2015. which established a more complete and complex definitionHousing Act 2004, ss. 254‚Äì260. Legislation.gov. Retrieved on March 30, 2015. and also introduced the requirement for some HMOs to be subject to mandatory licensing (see below). The Housing Act 1985 was a consolidating act. The definition of HMO in section 345 HA85 was from section 129(1) of the Housing Act 1974. The Housing Act 2004 introduced mandatory licensing for large HMOs which were defined in the Act as properties with 5 or more tenants forming more than 1 household sharing facilities such as kitchen bathroom and/or toilets over 3 or more floors. On 1st October 2018 \\"The Licensing of Houses in Multiple Occupation (Prescribed Description) (England) Order 2018\\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/221/contents/made amended the large HMO definition in the 2004 Act by abolishing the \\"3 or more floors\\" requirement. Nevertheless, purpose-built flats in a block of 3 or more such flats, were excluded from the amended classification. Apart from the statutory definition of HMOs requiring a mandatory licence, Local Authorities have the power to introduce approved licensing schemes which include smaller HMOs as licensable. Typically these are for 3 or more tenants forming more than 1 household. Section 257 HMOs The Housing Act 2004 (HA) introduced a classification of HMO under section 257 of that Act which includes self- contained flats in a converted block, where: * the conversion did not comply with 1991 building regulations * less than 2/3 of the self-contained flats are owner-occupied This classification helps bring buildings with inadequate fire and safety regulations under the control of Local Authority (LA) inspection regimes. s257 HMOs are often expressly included in LA Additional licensing schemes for HMOs. Council Tax The Council Tax (Liability for Owners) Regulations 1992 provide a different definition of HMO that is used solely for determining Council Tax liability. Typically, the landlord is required to pay Council Tax on behalf of tenants.  Cost for tenants  HMOs living spaces are often smaller but typically cheaper than a one bedroom flat. HMO agreements often include most utility bills with the rent. This is because it is difficult for landlords to apportion the cost of bills to each tenant fairly and it is also more appealing to potential tenants. Licensing HMO licensing was first introduced in Scotland in 2000. To be granted a licence under the scheme, properties must meet certain standards, such as presence of smoke detectors and fire doors. These provisions were included in response to a fatal fire at a student flat in Glasgow, which had no working smoke detectors, and metal bars preventing escape through a window. HMO schemes have been subsequently introduced to other parts of the UK, though the legal definition of what constitutes an HMO varies between Scotland, Northern Ireland, and England & Wales. Generally In the United Kingdom, an HMO has the following characteristics: * at least 3 tenants live there, forming more than 1 household and * toilet, bathroom or kitchen facilities are shared between tenants. Definitions of what constitutes an HMO and a household are set out in the law for each legal jurisdiction. England & Wales A home is a large HMO if all of the following apply : * at least five tenants live there, forming more than 1 household * toilet, bathroom or kitchen facilities are shared between tenants Before 1 October 2018, there was an additional criterion that the building was three or more storeys. Landlords of large HMOs must apply for a licence and must comply with certain standards and obligations. HMOs do not need to be licensed if they are managed or owned by a housing association or co-operative, a council, a further education institute or student housing provider, a health service or a police or fire authority. Where an Article 4 direction has been applied by a local authority, planning permission is required for the change of use of a dwelling house to HMO accommodation in the area designated. This is usually to protect the housing mix in particular areas of a city; for example in Newcastle upon Tyne article 4 directives have come into force in parts of Heaton, Jesmond, South Gosforth, Sandyford and Spital Tongues. Local Authorities Local authorities, manage and enforce the licensing of HMOs in England and Wales. Depending on the region of the Authority, they have some or all of the following powers, to vary: * the minimum size of a property requiring a licence * the licence fee and * the conditions of the licence. Penalties in England and Wales Failure to apply for or comply with the terms of a licence for an HMO constitutes a criminal offence. Tenants may be able to recover up to 12 months' rent from an unlicensed HMO landlord. Since The Housing and Planning Act 2016 (HaPA), tenants can make a Rent Repayment Order (RRO) application directly against the landlord and without waiting for the council to prosecute first (the situation under The Housing Act 2004 (HA)). Some tenants have been successful in recovering rent from landlords of unlicensed HMOs. Northern Ireland Northern Ireland is a separate legal jurisdiction within the UK and all HMOs must be registered and must comply with certain standards and obligations. In Northern ireland a property is an HMO if three or more people live in it, these people form at least three separate families or households and at least one person is paying some form of rent to live in the property. New regulations came in to force in April 2019 and a new licensing scheme managed by local councils has replaced the centralised registration scheme. Landlords must pass a fit and proper persons test, fixed penalties have been introduced HMO managers have to adhere to a Code of Practice. Scotland Scotland is a separate legal jurisdiction within the UK and all HMOs must be registered and must comply with certain standards and obligations. An HMO in Scotland is a property that is shared by three or more tenants who aren't members of the same family or household. The landlord must be ‚Äòa fit and proper person‚Äô and there are annual inspections to check the property (2006 Act). Hostels and halls of residence for students or nurses are considered to be HMOs in Scotland and the Scottish Government is considering extending the definition of an HMO. At the end of March 2019 there were over 15,600 licences in force and 87% of these were accounted for by the four major cities and the Fife local authority (Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow). Edinburgh accounts for almost two in five of Scotland‚Äôs HMO licences due to its higher rents, large student population, tourist lets and young professionals sharing. HMO investment HMOs are popular with buy-to-let investors because, it is believed, they have higher income-generating potential than ordinary or ‚Äòvanilla‚Äô buy-to-let properties. By splitting single properties into multiple bedsits that are each let out on separate tenancy agreements, landlords can also reduce their exposure to loss of earnings through rental arrears or voids. Controversy Some argue that HMO investment is necessitated by insufficient housing supply in the UK, whilst others argue that it is exploiting it.Dyson, R. Buy-to-let: creating bedsits for 20pc returns is just a response to the market. The Telegraph. July 25, 2014. Finance Due to the additional legal requirements placed upon HMO landlords, many buy-to-let mortgage lenders refuse to finance HMO properties. This has led to the emergence of a specialised HMO mortgage market, catered for by a smaller subset of lenders. Because the choice of products is narrower, HMO mortgage borrowers are often subject to stricter criteria. Often they need larger cash deposits, as the average loan-to-value ratio is slightly lower than for an ordinary buy-to-let mortgage, while the minimum property value tends to be higher. Borrowers who are financing unlicensed HMOs may also be required to prove that their local authority has no intention to license the property in the future. It is also common for HMO mortgage lenders to levy stipulations on various aspects of the property, including the number of rooms permitted, the type of tenancy agreement and the type of locks installed on internal and external doors.[https://www.commercialtrust.co.uk/buy-to-let-mortgage/product- types/hmo-mortgages/ .

SHS, built for 1200 students, contains 1,689 9th‚Äì12th graders (as of 2016‚Äì17). The school serves primarily those students living north of the Snohomish River (nearby Glacier Peak High School, serving those students living south of the river). History Before SHS actually opened it was a courthouse with a small jail section underneath. SHS first opened in 1894 at the completion of the original A building. The school underwent many remodels through the 1980s, including changes to the B building. These changes removed the last vestiges of 'old' Snohomish High School, making the building completely modern. Among the changes made to the B building were the removal of its decades-old fixed wooden bleachers and over-painting of many student-painted murals from the 1960s and earlier. There were also additions of music, science, and vocational buildings during this time. In an attempt to curb overcrowding, the C building was constructed and opened in 1999, adding ten more classrooms. As the school became more crowded, it received a grant to remodel the campus, tearing down the B building was a major change. Parts of B building have been incorporated into the schools newer buildings. Sports and athletics SHS is a member of the WESCO North division of Washington state, and consistently competes near the top of its division in both boys' and girls' sports. The 2007‚Äì08 season yielded two state championships for the school, one in boys' swimming and the other in boys' baseball.

Preparations During the Second World War Chatwin and his mother stayed at the home of his paternal grandparents, who had a curiosity cabinet that fascinated him. Among the items it contained was a \\"piece of brontosaurus\\" (actually a mylodon, a giant sloth), which had been sent to Chatwin's grandmother by her cousin Charles Amherst Milward. In a cave in Chilean Patagonia, Milward had discovered the remains of a giant sloth, which he later sold to the British Museum. He sent his cousin a piece of the animal's skin, and members of the family mistakenly referred to it as a \\"piece of brontosaurus.\\" The skin was later lost but it inspired Chatwin decades later to visit Patagonia.Utz, Richard. \\"In Patagonia\\". The Literary Encyclopedia. 09 March 2001 In 1972, Chatwin was hired by the Sunday Times Magazine as an adviser on art and architecture.. In 1972, he interviewed the 93-year-old architect and designer Eileen Gray in her Paris salon, where he noticed a map of the area of South America called Patagonia which she had painted. \\"I've always wanted to go there,\\" Bruce told her. \\"So have I,\\" she replied, \\"go there for me.\\" In Patagonia Two years later, in November 1974, Chatwin flew out to Lima in Peru and reached Patagonia a month later.. He would later claim that he sent a telegram to his editor merely stating: \\"Have gone to Patagonia.\\" Actually he sent a letter: \\"I am doing a story there for myself, something I have always wanted to write up.\\" He spent six months in the area, travelling around gathering stories of people who came from elsewhere and settled there. He used his quest for his own \\"piece of brontosaurus\\" (the one from his grandparents' cabinet had been thrown away years earlier) to frame the story of his trip. Chatwin described In Patagonia as \\"the narrative of an actual journey and a symbolic one ... It is supposed to fall into the category or be a spoof of Wonder Voyage: the narrator goes to a far country in search of a strange animal: on his way he lands in strange situations, people or other books tell him strange stories which add up to form a message.\\" Content The book is experimental in the way that it is structured. It is divided into a total of 97 separate sections, some of which are as short as a lone paragraph. In a sense this construction with its frequent use of digression, rather than a standard linear structure, mirrors one of the underlying themes of the work as a whole: a meditation upon wandering and nomadism in human life. This is accentuated by the fact that many of the narratives of the people that Chatwin meets in the work involve discussions of the nomadic life. Chatwin's route takes him from Buenos Aires south through Argentina as far as Ushuaia, and thence to Punta Arenas, Puerto Natales and the Cueva del Milodon in Chile. The many topics he discusses in the book include the landscape and wildlife of Patagonia, the history of European exploration and settlement, Butch Cassidy's time in Patagonia, anarchists and strikers, and the fate of the native inhabitants. Critics This work established Chatwin's reputation as a travel writer. One of his biographers, Nicholas Murray, called In Patagonia \\"one of the most strikingly original postwar English travel books\\" and said that it revitalised the genre of travel writing. The New York Times described it as a \\"little masterpiece of travel, history, and adventure.\\"Review at Powell's Books Some reviewers compared it with classics of travel literature such as Travels by Sir John Mandeville, Eothen by Alexander Kinglake and The Road to Oxiana by Robert Byron. However, residents in the region contradicted the account of events depicted in Chatwin's book. It was the first time in his career, but not the last, that conversations and characters which Chatwin presented as fact were later alleged to be fiction. In the words of his biographer Nicholas Shakespeare, \\"Critics ... suspected that a number of Chatwin's brontosauri were mylodons.\\"Nicholas Shakespeare (2005), Introduction to In Patagonia, Vintage, page xxiv In Patagonia contains 15 black and white photographs by Chatwin. According to Susannah Clapp, who edited the book, \\"Rebecca West amused Chatwin by telling him that these were so good they rendered superfluous the entire text of the book.\\" Prizes For In Patagonia Chatwin received the Hawthornden Prize and the E. M. Forster Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

Howell returned to the Giants in 1954 as head coach, succeeding fan, media and player favorite Steve Owen. Howell quickly hired Vince Lombardi as his offensive coordinator and shortly after converted Tom Landry from player to defensive coordinator. From 1954 to 1960, the Giants played in three NFL Championship Games, defeating George Halas's Chicago Bears in 1956 by the score of 47‚Äì7. During Howell's seven seasons as head coach, he earned a career 53‚Äì27‚Äì4 record, with a .663 winning percentage. He drafted and coached a roster of stars including six future Pro Football Hall of Famers, Sam Huff, Andy Robustelli, Rosey Brown, Emlen Tunnell, Frank Gifford and Don Maynard. Although his conservative, defense-oriented style was unpopular with the fans and media, the Giants' success on the field was more satisfying. Several other players from this era went on to become head coaches and broadcasters. Howell played and coached in an era when football went from a relatively simple game to one of great complexity with schemes, formations and playbooks designed to deceive as much as over power. With future Hall of Famers Lombardi and Landry as coordinators, Howell's job was frequently to play the diplomat within his own team. Howell stayed with the team as Director of Player Personnel until his retirement in 1981. He died on January 4, 1995 in Lonoke, Arkansas.

In 1988, he joined the group Level 42 as a full-time band member, and played with them until his death from pneumonia, resulting from AIDS, in 1989. He also played lead guitar on select recordings by Mike + The Mechanics, including the hit single \\"Silent Running (On Dangerous Ground)\\". Biography Murphy's first musical group was called Blackmass and consisted of Murphy, Roy Phillips, James Hedges, Terry Eden, Steve Paget, and Vincent Duffy. Blackmass were named in tribute to Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, an early influence of Murphy's, and existed for about two years until some of the band's equipment was stolen and the group disbanded. SFX was an instrumental jazz-rock fusion band featuring Murphy and fellow luminaries of the session world, Felix Krish on bass, Tony Beard on drums and Richard Cottle on keyboards. SFX originated from the covers band \\"The Stapleton Allstars\\", morphing into SFX after creating a set of original instrumental fusion tunes. They played the occasional interrupted residency at the Cricketers pub, near The Oval cricket ground. The band recorded an album which was subsequently released after Murphy's death. Murphy performed with Fusion Orchestra for the better part of 1975. In 1982, he handled on-stage guitar duties for London- based New Wave vocalist Zaine Griff (originally from New Zealand), performing music that was in many ways a stylistic precursor to the sound of Go West that he would help forge several years later. In 1984, Murphy worked on the album Cold in a Warm Climate with the band Paparazzi, becoming a member in preparation for a major European tour. When Paparazzi unexpectedly dissolved over internal disagreements and managerial problems, Murphy was recruited to play on the debut album of Go West in 1985, shortly thereafter becoming an official member and a key component in their sound. Murphy was enlisted to support Kate Bush on The Tour of Life, which took in Europe and the UK in 1979. Both a live video and EP were released with material taken from this tour. He also contributed to her albums Never for Ever, The Dreaming, Hounds of Love, The Sensual World, and the single \\"Rocket Man\\". In 1988, Murphy was asked to replace Level 42 guitarist Boon Gould, and recorded with the band on their Staring at the Sun album. A live album was recorded during this period, Live at Wembley. This was one of the last major projects that Murphy worked on before his death. Murphy was a session man who worked with many artists, including Rod Stewart on the Atlantic Crossing Tour in 1976, David Bowie, Ace on their No. 1 hit ‚Ä≥How Long‚Ä≥, Nick Heyward, Long John Baldry, Joan Armatrading, Mike + the Mechanics, Amii Stewart, Andrew Caine, Eikichi Yazawa, Scritti Politti, So, Iain Williams and Miquel Brown. Alan also shared an extensive and fruitful writing partnership with his distant cousin Michael Finbarr Murphy who wrote and played guitar for Heatwave, Central Line and Diana Ross among others. During 1989, Murphy played at the British Music Fair, but it was evident from his appearance that he was not well. With Level 42, he performed \\"Heaven In My Hands\\" and \\"Lessons in Love\\" at The Prince's Trust Rock Gala, a charity event held at the NEC in Birmingham on 19 July 1989. On 19 October 1989, weakened by the AIDS virus, Murphy died of pneumonia in Westminster City Hospital, near his old school. He had kept the facts of his illness a secret even from his colleagues and fellow band members; according to Level 42 bassist Mark King, the band knew that Murphy was homosexual and his death was a 'dreadful loss'. In the music video for Kate Bush's version of \\"Rocket Man\\", released as part of the 1991 tribute album Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John & Bernie Taupin, she performs with her band but there is an empty chair, a guitar and a candle where Murphy would have been, and cross-faded footage of him playing in the closing choruses. 'This is one of the last tracks that he did with us,' Bush told BBC Radio 1, 'and it's particularly nice for me to feel that it's not only keeping him alive, but I know he would be really thrilled to know that [the single] was doing so well. And it's nice for all of us that loved Al to know that he can be a part of this now.'BBC Radio 1, 14 December 1991 Bush's song \\"Moments of Pleasure\\" referenced Murphy and several other people dear to her who had died. Level 42 referenced Murphy on the B-side to their 1994 single \\"Love in a Peaceful World\\", on the song \\"Heart on the Line\\"; 'So ring a bell for brother Al, he never did no wrong. The only thing he did was lay his heart out on the line.'

Under a directive by Paul Bikle, NASA engineer Charles Richard in 1961‚Äì1962 designed the collapsible four-tube Rogallo wing used in the Paresev. The Paresev series included wing configurations that were tightly foldable from the nose plate for easy transport, using initially a cloth sail and later one of Dacron.

Officially, North Korea is an atheist state. Based on estimates from the late 1990sChryssides, Geaves. 2007. p. 110 and the 2000s,Association of Religion Data Archives: North Korea: Religious Adherents, 2010. Data from the World Christian Database. North Korea is mostly irreligious, with the main religions being Korean shamanism and Chondoism. There are small communities of Buddhists and Christians. Chondoism is represented in politics by the Party of the Young Friends of the Heavenly Way, and is regarded by the government as Korea's \\"national religion\\" because of its identity as a minjung (popular) and \\"revolutionary anti-imperialist\\" movement. History Before 1945 In ancient times, most Koreans believed in their indigenous religion socially guided by mu (shamans). Buddhism was introduced from the Chinese Former Qin state in 372 to the northern Korean state of Goguryeo,Asia For Educators: Korea, 300 to 600 CE. Columbia University, 2009. and developed into distinctive Korean forms. At that time, the Korean peninsula was divided into three kingdoms: the aforementioned Goguryeo in the north, Baekje in the southwest, and Silla in the southeast. Buddhism reached Silla only in the 5th century, but it was made the state religion only in that kingdom in the year 552. In Goguryeo the Korean indigenous religion remained dominant, while Buddhism became more widespread in Silla and Baekje (both areas comprehended in modern South Korea). In the following unified state of Goryeo (918‚Äì1392), that developed from Goguryeo incorporating the southern kingdoms, Buddhism flourished even becoming a political force.Vermeersch, Sem. (2008). The Power of the Buddhas: the Politics of Buddhism during the Kory≈è Dynasty (918‚Äì1392). p. 3 In the same period, the influence of Chinese Confucianism penetrated the country and led to the formation of Korean Confucianism that would have become the state ideology and religion of the following Joseon state. The Joseon kingdom (1392‚Äì1910), strictly Neo-Confucian, harshly suppressed Korean BuddhismGrayson, 2002. pp. 120‚Äì138Tudor, 2012. and Korean shamanism. Buddhist monasteries were destroyed and their number dropped from several hundreds to a mere thirty-six; Buddhism was eradicated from the life of towns as monks and nuns were prohibited from entering them and were marginalised to the mountains. These restrictions lasted until the 19th century.Grayson, 2002. p. 137 A Protestant church at Sorae (now Ryongyon County, South Hwanghae Province) in 1895. In this environment, Christianity began to rapidly gain foothold since the late 18th century, due to an intense missionary activity that was aided by the endorsement at first by the Silhak and Seohak intellectual parties, and then at the end of the following century by the king of Korea himself and the intellectual elite of the crumbling Joseon state, who were looking for a new social factor to invigorate the Korean nation.Grayson, 2002. pp. 155‚Äì161 In the late 19th century, the Joseon state was politically and culturally collapsing.Grayson, 2002. p. 155 The intelligentsia was looking for solutions to invigorate and transform the nation. It was in this critical period that they came into contact with Western Protestant missionaries who offered a solution to the plight of Koreans. Christian communities already existed in Joseon, however it was only by the 1880s that the government allowed a large number of Western missionaries to enter the country.Grayson, 2002. p. 157 Protestant missionaries set up schools, hospitals and publishing agencies.Grayson, 2002. pp. 157‚Äì158 The king of Korea and his family tacitly supported Christianity. From the late nineteenth century, the northwest of Korea, and Pyongyang in particular, became a stronghold of Christianity. As a result, Pyongyang was called the \\"Jerusalem of the East\\". At the dawn of the 20th century, almost the totality of the population of Korea believed in the indigenous shamanic religion and practiced Confucian rites and ancestral worship.Pyong Gap Min, 2014. Korean Buddhism was nearly dead, reduced to a tiny and weak minority of monks, despite its long history and cultural influence, because of 500 years of suppression by the ruling Neo-Confucian Joseon kingdom, which also disregarded traditional cults.Joon-sik Choi, 2006. p. 15 During the absorption of Korea into the Japanese Empire (1910‚Äì1945) the already formed link of Christianity with Korean nationalism was strengthened,Grayson, 2002. pp. 158-161 as the Japanese tried to impose State Shinto and Christians refused to take part in Shinto rituals. At the same time, numerous religious movements that since the 19th century had been trying to reform the Korean indigenous religion, notably Chondoism, flourished. Christianity became widespread especially in the north of the peninsula,Grayson, 2002. p. 158 as did ChondoismCarl Young. Into the Sunset: Ch‚Äô≈èndogyo in North Korea, 1945‚Äì1950. On: Journal of Korean Religions, Volume 4, Number 2, October 2013. pp. 51‚Äì66 / 10.1353/jkr.2013.0010 which aimed to counter Christian influence. After the division Delegation of the group \\"Modern American Buddhism\\", of Korean Americans in New York City,Uri Tours: Exclusive Buddhist Temple Tour of North Korea at Pohyonsa in 2013. The Korean Peninsula was divided into two states in 1945, the communist north and the non-communist south. Most of the Korean Christians, that had been until then in the northern half of the peninsula,Grayson, 2002. p. 158, p. 162 fled to South Korea.Grayson, 2002. p. 163 By contrast, most of Korean Chondoists remained in the newly formed North Korea. At the time of the partition they were 1.5 million, or 16% of North Korea's population.Park, 2009. p. 346 They participate to the politics of North Korea through the Party of the Young Friends of the Heavenly Way. In 1994 the Central Guidance Committee of the Korean Chondoist Association organised an impressive ceremony at the newly constructed Mausoleum of Dangun (mythical founder of the Korean nation) near Pyongyang.Corfield, 2013. p. 208 According to some estimates in 2005 in North Korea there are 3,846,000 (16% of the total population) believers of Korean shamanism, 3,245,000 (13.5%) Chondoists, 1,082,000 (4.5%) Buddhists, and 406,000 (1.7%) Christians. In 2007 there were approximately 800 Chondoist churches throughout the country and a large central building in Pyongyang, 60 Buddhist temples (maintained more as cultural relics than places of worship), and 5 Christian churches‚Äîthree Protestant churches, one Catholic church, and one Russian Orthodox church, all of which located in Pyongyang. In 2014, the Korea Conference of Religions for Peace held an inter-Korean meeting at Mount Kumgang, North Korea, and another is planned in 2017 in Pyongyang. Religion and politics Juche ideology The successive constitutions of North Korea reflect different official attitudes toward organized religion. Article 14 of the 1948 constitution noted that \\"citizens of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea shall have the freedom of religious belief and of conducting religious services\\". Article 54 of the 1972 constitution stated that \\"citizens have religious liberty and the freedom to oppose religion\\". Some observers argued that the change occurred because in 1972 the political authorities no longer needed the support of the much-weakened organized religions. In the 1992 amended constitution, Article 68 grants freedom of religious belief and guarantees the right to construct buildings for religious use and religious ceremonies. The article also states that \\"no one may use religion as a means by which to drag in foreign powers or to destroy the state or social order\\". North Korea has been represented at international religious conferences by state-sponsored religious organizations such as the Korean Buddhist Federation, the Korean Christian Federation, the Chondoist Church and Chondoist Party. Some commentators detect religious or spiritual overtones in the cult of the Kims, together with the doctrine of Juche (self-reliance). Juche appeared in the 1960s as an idea of national autonomy but it has developed a universal character. The doctrine proclaims that human beings should break free of any dependency on spiritual ideas and realize that, working together, they can achieve all their goals without supernatural assistance. It promises believers that, through joining the Juche community, they can overcome death and become immortals. According to Juche teachings, human beings only exist in social contexts. There is no human who is utterly alone, who has no relationships or interactions with other humans. Human beings will continue to exist even after physical death only if the society that defines them continues to exist. Some scholars see Juche as having Confucian features, but without the Confucian ancestral kinship structuring of society. Rather, Juche's aim is a national community. Moreover, Juche has as its spiritual focus the mythified figure of Kim Il-sung. He gained mythical status for his actions, carried out as early as the 1930s, against the Japanese occupation of Korea and Manchuria. In Juche writings, Kim Il-sung and his successors are at times portrayed as divine beings. In addition, the North Korean Juche calendar counts the years starting from the birth of Kim Il-sung in 1912. Other studies see Christian influences in Juche. Between 1989 and 1992 discussions about unification and the compatibility of Juche and Christianity took place between North Korean, South Korean and Korean-American theologians. Park Seung-deok, a Juche scholar from Pyongyang, concluded that Juche and Christianity share common goals and values. North Korean anti- religion campaigns It is very difficult for outside observers to know what has happened to North Korean religious bodies over the past 60 years due to the extreme isolation of the state. One interpretation has held that all open religious activity in North Korea was persecuted and eradicated after Kim Il- sung took power, only to be revived in the present as part of a political show.. Another interpretation has held that religion survived and has genuinely been revived in the past few decades. Kim Il-sung criticized religion in his writings, and North Korean propaganda in literature, movies and other media have presented religion in a negative light. Kim Il-sung's attack on religion was strongly based on the idea that religion had been used as a tool for imperialists in the Korean peninsula. He criticized Christians for collaborating with the United Nations' forces against him during the Korean War, although he praised Christians who supported him. Accounts from the Korean War speak of harsh persecution of religion by Kim Il-sung in the areas he controlled. Prior to the war, the Christian population of the Korean peninsula was most heavily concentrated in the north; during the war, many of these Christians fled to the South. Some interpretations have considered that the Christian community was often of a higher socio-economic class than the rest of the population, which may have prompted its departure for fear of persecution. The large-scale destruction caused by the massive air raids and the suffering experienced by North Koreans during the Korean War helped foster hatred of Christianity as being the American religion. Religion was attacked in the ensuing years as an obstacle to the construction of communism, and many people abandoned their former religions in order to conform to the new reality. On the basis of accounts from the Korean War as well as information from defectors, an interpretation has held that the North Korea was the Second state in the world state to have completely eradicated religion by the 1960s. Buddhism was thought to have been eradicated, under this interpretation and its reappearance later was thought to be a show. The Federation of Korean Christians in North Korea (created in 1970), under this interpretation, has been considered a fake organization meant to present a favourable image to the outside world. Other interpretations have thought that they do represent genuine faith communities that survived the persecutions. An interpretation has considered that these religious communities may have been believers who genuinely adhered to Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and the leadership of Kim Il-sung, thus ensuring their survival. This interpretation has been supported by recent evidence gathered that has shown that the North Korean government may have tolerated the existence of up to 200 pro-communist Christian congregations during the 1960s, and by the fact that several high-ranking people in the government were Christians and they were buried with high honours (for instance Kang Yang Wook was a Presbyterian minister who served as vice president of North Korea from 1972 to 1982, and Kim Chang Jun was a Methodist minister who served as vice chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly). Differing interpretations often agree on the disappearance of religion under Kim Il-sung in the first few decades of his rule. The government never made an open public policy statement about religion, leading to unresolved speculation among scholars as to what exactly the government's position was at any point in time. Main religions Cheondoism Chondoism (Ï≤úÎèÑÍµê Ch'≈èndogyo) or Cheondoism (South Korean spelling) is a religion with roots in Confucianised indigenous shamanism. It is the religious dimension of the Donghak (\\"Eastern Learning\\") movement that was founded by Choe Je-u (1824‚Äì1864), a member of an impoverished yangban (aristocratic) family, in 1860 as a counter-force to the rise of \\"foreign religions\\", which in his view included Buddhism and Christianity (part of Seohak, the wave of Western influence that penetrated Korean life at the end of the 19th century). Choe Je-u founded Chondoism after having been allegedly healed from illness by an experience of Sangje or Haneullim, the god of the universal Heaven in traditional shamanism. The Donghak movement became so influential among common people that in 1864 the Joseon government sentenced Choe Je-u to death. The movement grew and in 1894 the members gave rise to the Donghak Peasant Revolution against the royal government. With the division of Korea in 1945, most of the Chondoist community remained in the north, where the majority of them dwelled. Chondoism is the sole religion to be favoured by the North Korean government. It has political representation as the Party of the Young Friends of the Heavenly Way, and is regarded by the government as Korea's \\"national religion\\"KCNA: Chondoism, National Religion. North Korea Economy Watch 5/23/2007. because of its identity as a minjung (popular) and \\"revolutionary anti-imperialist\\" movement. Korean shamanism Korean shamanism, also known as \\"Muism\\" (Î¨¥Íµê Mugyo, \\"mu [shaman] religion\\")Used in: Chang Soo-kyung, Kim Tae-gon. Korean Shamanism ‚Äì Muism. Jimoondang, 1998. or \\"Sinism\\" (Ïã†Íµê Singyo, \\"religion of the shin () [gods]\\"),Used in: Margaret Stutley. Shamanism: A Concise Introduction. Routledge, 2003. is the ethnic religion of Korea and the Koreans. Although used synonymously, the two terms aren't identical: Jung Young Lee describes Muism as a form of Sinism ‚Äì the shamanic tradition within the religion. Other names for the religion are \\"Sindo\\" (Ïã†ÎèÑ \\"Way of the Gods\\") or \\"Sindoism\\" (Ïã†ÎèÑÍµê Sindogyo, \\"religion of the Way of the Gods\\").Lee Chi-ran, p. 13 In contemporary Korean language the shaman-priest or mu () is known as a mudang ( ) if female or baksu if male, although other names and locutions are used. Korean mu \\"shaman\\" is synonymous with Chinese wu, which defines priests both male and female. The role of the mudang is to act as intermediary between the spirits or gods, and the human plain, through gut (rituals), seeking to resolve problems in the patterns of development of human life.Joon-sik Choi, 2006. p. 21 Central to the faith is the belief in Haneullim or Hwanin, meaning \\"source of all being\\", and of all gods of nature, the utmost god or the supreme mind. The mu are mythically described as descendants of the \\"Heavenly King\\", son of the \\"Holy Mother [of the Heavenly King]\\", with investiture often passed down through female princely lineage. However, other myths link the heritage of the traditional faith to Dangun, male son of the Heavenly King and initiator of the Korean nation. Korean Muism has similarities with Chinese Wuism, Japanese Shinto, and with the Siberian, Mongolian, and Manchurian religious traditions. As highlighted by anthropological studies, the Korean ancestral god Dangun is related to the Ural-Altaic Tengri \\"Heaven\\", the shaman and the prince.Sorensen, p. 19-20 The mudang is similar to the Japanese miko and the Ryukyuan yuta. Muism has exerted an influence on some Korean new religions, such as Chondoism in North Korea. According to various sociological studies, many Christian churches in Korea make use of practices rooted in shamanism as the Korean shamanic theology has affinity to that of Christianity.Andrew E. Kim. Korean Religious Culture and Its Affinity to Christianity. Korea University, Sociology of Religion, 2000. In the 1890s, the twilight years of the Joseon kingdom, Protestant missionaries gained significant influence, and led a demonisation of the traditional religion through the press, and even carried out campaigns of physical suppression of local cults.Kendall, 2010. pp. 4‚Äì7 The Protestant discourse would have had an influence on all further attempts to uproot Muism. There is no knowledge about the survival of Korean shamanism in contemporary North Korea.Walter, Fridman. 2004. p. 654 Many northern shamans, displaced by war and politics, migrated to South Korea. Shamans in North Korea were (or are) of the same type of those of northern and central areas of South Korea (kangshinmu). Minor religions Buddhism Pohyon Temple, at Mount Myohyang in Hyangsan County, North Pyongan Province. Note that the lay participants are members of a Korean American Buddhist group visiting the temple. Buddhism (Î∂àÍµê Pulgyo) entered Korea from China during the period of the three kingdoms (372, or the 4th century). Buddhism was the dominant religious and cultural influence in the Silla (668‚Äì935) and subsequent Goryeo (918‚Äì1392) states. Confucianism was also brought to Korea from China in early centuries, and was formulated as Korean Confucianism in Goryeo. However, it was only in the subsequent Joseon kingdom (1392‚Äì1910) that Korean Confucianism was established as the state ideology and religion, and Korean Buddhism underwent 500 years of suppression, from which it began to recover only in the 20th century. Buddhists are a minority in North Korea, and their traditions have developed differently from those of South Korean Buddhists after the division of the country. Buddhism in North Korea is practiced under the auspices of the official Korea Buddhist Federation, an organ of the North Korean state apparatus. North Korean Buddhist monks are entirely dependent on state wages for their livelihood as well as state authorization to practice. As of 2009, the leader of the Korean Buddhist Federation is Yu Yong-sun. There are only 60 Buddhist temples in the country, and they are viewed as cultural relics from Korea's past rather than places of active worship. Also, there is a three-year college for training Buddhist clergy. A limited revival of Buddhism is apparently taking place. This includes the establishment of an academy for Buddhist studies and the publication of a twenty-five-volume translation of the Korean Tripitaka, or Buddhist scriptures, which had been carved on 80,000 wooden blocks and kept at the temple at Myohyangsan in central North Korea. Recently, South Korean Buddhist leaders have been allowed to travel to North Korea and participate in religious ceremonies or give aid to civilians. Despite the North Korean government's official stance on religion, Buddhism along with Confucianism both still have an effect on cultural life in North Korea as they are traditional religions of traditional Korean culture. Christianity Changchung Cathedral, seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pyongyang. Church of the Life-Giving Trinity of the Russian Orthodox Church in Pyongyang. Attendees at the Protestant Bongsu Church in Pyongyang. Christianity () became very popular in northern Korea from the late 18th century to the 19th century. The first Catholic missionaries arrived in 1794, a decade after the return of Yi Sung-hun, a diplomat who was the first baptised Korean in Beijing.Choi Suk- woo. Korean Catholicism Yesterday and Today. On: Korean Journal XXIV, 8, August 1984. pp. 5‚Äì6 He established a grassroots lay Catholic movement in the peninsula. However, the writings of the Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci, who was resident at the imperial court in Beijing, had been already brought to Korea from China in the 17th century. Scholars of the Silhak (\\"Practical Learning\\"), were attracted to Catholic doctrines, and this was a key factor for the spread of the Catholic faith in the 1790s.Kim Han-sik. The Influence of Christianity. On: Korean Journal XXIII, 12, December 1983. pp. 5‚Äì7 The penetration of Western ideas and Christianity in Korea became known as Seohak (\\"Western Learning\\"). A study of 1801 found that more than half of the families that had converted to Catholicism were linked to the Silhak school.Kim Ok-hy. Women in the History of Catholicism in Korea. On: Korean Journal XXIV, 8, August 1984. p. 30 Largely because converts refused to perform Confucian ancestral rituals, the Joseon government prohibited the proselytisation of Christianity. Some Catholics were executed during the early 19th century, but the restrictive law was not strictly enforced. Protestant missionaries entered Korea during the 1880s and, along with Catholic priests, converted a remarkable number of Koreans, this time with the tacit support of the royal government. Methodist and Presbyterian missionaries were especially successful. They established schools, universities, hospitals, and orphanages and played a significant role in the modernisation of the country. During the Japanese colonial occupation, Christians were in the front ranks of the struggle for independence. Factors contributing to the growth of Catholicism and Protestantism included the decayed state of Korean Buddhism, the support of the intellectual elite, and the encouragement of self-support and self- government among members of the Korean church, and finally the identification of Christianity with Korean nationalism. A large number of Christians lived in the northern half of the peninsula (it was part of the so-called \\"Manchurian revival\\") where Confucian influence was not as strong as in the south. Before 1948, Pyongyang was an important Christian center: The city was known as the \\"Jerusalem of the East\\". Many Korean Communists came from a Christian background; Kim Il-sung's mother was a Presbyterian deaconess. He attended a mission school and played the organ in church. In his memoir With the Century, he wrote: \\"I do not think the spirit of Christianity that preaches universal peace and harmony contradicts my idea advocating an independent life for man\\". In 1945, with the establishment of the communist regime in the north, however, most Christians fled to South Korea to escape persecution. Christianity came to be discouraged by the North Korean government because of its association with America.Ryu, Dae Young (2006), \\"Fresh wineskins for new wine: a new perspective on North Korean Christianity\\", Journal of Church and State 48 (3). In the 1980s, North Korea produced its own translation of the Bible, which has since been used by Southern missionaries attempting to evangelize the North. By the late 1980s, it became apparent that Christians were active in the governmental elite. In those years, three new churches, two Protestant and one Catholic, were opened in Pyongyang. Other signs of the regime's changing attitude towards Christianity included holding the \\"International Seminar of Christians of the North and South for the Peace and Reunification of Korea\\" in Switzerland in 1988, allowing papal representatives to attend the opening of the Changchung Cathedral of Pyongyang in that same year, and sending two North Korean novice priests to study in Rome. A Protestant seminary in Pyongyang taught future leaders of the North Korean government. A new association of Roman Catholics was established in June 1988. A North Korean Protestant pastor reported at a 1989 meeting of the National Council of Churches in Washington that his country had 10,000 Protestants and 1,000 Catholics who worshiped in 500 home churches. Today, the total number of Christians in North Korea is liberally estimated to be no more than somewhere between 12,000 and 15,000. In 1992 and 1994, American evangelist Billy Graham visited North Korea. He met Kim Il-sung, giving him a Bible, and preached at Kim Il-sung University. In 2008, his son Franklin Graham visited the country.Billy Graham Evangelistic Association: Janet Chismar, The Graham Family Legacy in North Korea. July 30, 2008. In 1991, North Korea invited the Pope to visit. In 2018, the government invited Pope Francis to visit. In late 2018, Metropolitan Hilarion Alfeyev of the Russian Orthodox Church visited North Korea, meeting with officials and leading a service at the Church of the Life-Giving Trinity in Pyongyang. North Korean Christians are officially represented by the Korean Christian Federation, a state-controlled body responsible for contacts with churches and governments abroad. In Pyongyang there are five church buildings: the Catholic Changchung Cathedral, three Protestant churches inaugurated in 1988 in the presence of South Korean church officials, and a Russian Orthodox church consecrated in 2006.. The internationally-supported Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, which opened in 2010, operates with a Christian ethos. Christian aid groups, including the American Friends Service Committee, the Mennonite Central Committee, the Eugene Bell Foundation, and World Vision, are able to operate in the country, but not allowed to proselytize. In 2016, Christmas was celebrated in North Korea, but with the religious overtones downplayed. In 2018, the North Korean Council of Religionists sent a Christmas message to South Korea that expressed the wish that believers on both sides \\"go hand in hand towards peace and unification, filled with blessings by Christ the Lord\\". According to Open Doors, North Korea is the country in which Christians are persecuted the most. Islam The Pew Research Center estimated that there were 3,000 Muslims in North Korea in 2010, an increase from the 1,000 Muslims in 1990. There is a mosque in the Iranian embassy in Pyongyang called Ar-Rahman Mosque, the only mosque in the country. The mosque was likely built for the embassy staff, but visits by other foreigners are deemed possible, too.

He was adjudged and executed for war crimes committed during the time of Nazi Germany. Early life Hildebrandt was born in Parchim, Mecklenburg-Schwerin. He entered service in the German Army on 19 April 1916 as a \\"Kriegsfreiwilliger\\" (literally, \\"war volunteer\\") and was assigned to Reserve-Infanterie-Regiment 24 on the Western Front. He was severely gassed in Flanders in 1917, and wounded twice before the end of the First World War. During January 1919, he returned to Mecklenburg and joined the 1.Kompanie/Freikorps \\"von Brandis\\" (in Silesia and on the Baltic). He served there until his capture and imprisonment by the Red Army in Riga. He was later released and returned to Germany, being discharged from the German Army as a Vizefeldwebel in January, 1920. From March, 1920 to June, 1920, he was a member of the Sicherheitspolizei in Halle, with which he participated in the suppression of the \\"Kapp-Putsch\\" in March, 1920. In the wake of the Putsch, he was tried for excessive brutality against captured Spartakists in Osterfeld/Weissenfels. Although acquitted, he was dismissed from police service. He found employment as a farm worker and gardener. Nazi Party career He joined the Nazi Party in February 1925. On 27 March 1925 he was appointed Gauleiter of Gau Mecklenburg-L√ºbeck. Briefly suspended in July 1930 for criticism of Hitler's alliance with industry, he was reinstated on 31 January 1931. He was elected to the Reichstag in September 1930. After the Nazi seizure of power, he was made Reichsstatthalter (Reich Governor) of the Free State of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the Free State of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and the City of L√ºbeck on 26 May 1933. He thus united under his control the highest party and governmental offices in his jurisdictions. On 1 January 1934, the two Free States in his jurisdiction were combined into a unified Mecklenburg. Under the Greater Hamburg Act the City of L√ºbeck was transferred to Gau Schleswig-Holstein on 1 April 1937 and Hildebrandt's Gau was renamed Gau Mecklenburg. A member of the SS since 1933, on 30 January 1942 Hildebrandt was promoted to SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer, and on 16 November he was named Reich Defense Commissioner for his Gau. After World War II ended, he was arrested and interned by U.S. forces, and tried in the Allied Dachau Trials. He was sentenced specifically in the Airmen's Trial, for contraventions of the Hague Conventions by issuing orders to shoot parachuting U.S. aircrewmen. Friedrich Hildebrandt was then put to death by hanging at Landsberg am Lech on 5 November 1948. References Michael D.

It was produced by Blake Corbet, Mary Anne Waterhouse, Trent Carlson and Kevin Eastwood of Anagram Pictures, and released in the United States by Lions Gate Entertainment.  Plot  The film takes place in a 1950s-esque alternate universe where radiation from space has turned the dead into zombies. This resulted in the \\"Zombie Wars\\", where humanity battled zombies to prevent a zombie apocalypse, with humanity the ultimate victor. The radiation still plagues humanity, as all those who die turn into the undead, unless the dead body is disposed of by decapitation or cremation. In order to continue living normal lives, communities are fenced with the help of a governing corporation named ZomCon. ZomCon provides collars with accompanying remote controls to control the zombies' hunger for flesh so as to use them as menial task servants. In the town of Willard, housewife Helen Robinson (Carrie-Anne Moss) buys a zombie (Billy Connolly) in spite of her husband Bill's (Dylan Baker) zombie phobia, as Bill had to kill his own father who had become a zombie and tried to eat him. Their son, Timmy (K'Sun Ray), befriends the zombie, naming him \\"Fido\\" (little is revealed of his \\"pre-zombie\\" life, except that he likely died of myocardial infarction as evidenced by the chest incision). One day, Fido's collar malfunctions and he accidentally kills their next door neighbor, who turns into a zombie. Timmy \\"kills\\" the zombified neighbor later, but not before she kills and infects another person, causing a small zombie outbreak. ZomCon security forces quell the situation and then investigate what caused the outbreak. When a pair of local bullies get caught shooting a ZomCon officer, they are suspected of shooting the missing neighbor, but they point the blame on Fido who hurt them when they tried bullying Timmy. The bullies later capture Fido and Timmy, who are out on a walk in the country. Fido escapes and, in a parody of Lassie, is sent by Timmy to go home and find Helen. Helen comes and rescues Timmy from the bullies (who, through their own misadventure and Fido's hunger for human flesh, are now zombies), and they try to forget about the whole thing. Several days later, the neighbor's body is 'uncovered' and the murder is traced back to Fido, who is taken away to ZomCon where the family is told he will be destroyed. Timmy learns through Cindy Bottoms (Alexia Fast), daughter of Jonathan Bottoms (Henry Czerny), ZomCon's zealous security chief, that Fido has been put to work in a factory at ZomCon. Timmy sets out to rescue him with the help of Mr. Theopolis (Tim Blake Nelson), a previous ZomCon employee who was forced to leave when it was discovered he was suspected of fraternizing with his attractive female zombie. Meanwhile, Timmy locates Fido, but is captured by Mr. Bottoms, who attempts to throw Timmy into the zombie-infested \\"wild zone\\" that exists outside of the fenced communities as punishment for his becoming attached to a zombie. Bill comes to the rescue and is killed in a struggle with Mr. Bottoms, who in turn is killed by Fido. Timmy is set free and the news media states that the ZomCon security breach was the fault of rednecks who ventured out into the wild zone to hunt zombies for fun. Helen gives Bill the headless funeral he always wanted in order to prevent his zombification. The film ends with Fido as a surrogate father to Timmy, Helen, and Helen's newborn baby. They, along with a few neighbors, happily enjoy their new domestic lives together, including the zombified Jonathan Bottoms who is now under the control of his daughter. Cast  Production  Filming took place in Kelowna, British Columbia over 35 days. Director Andrew Currie wanted to make a cross-genre film, to avoid predictability. Currie was influenced by Lassie Come Home, The Night of the Hunter, Douglas Sirk films of the 1950s, Peyton Place, and George A. Romero's zombie films. The script was originally written in 1994, but creative differences kept it tied up. Eventually, Currie optioned it through his production company and completed the picture. The film was completely storyboarded prior to filming.  Release  Fido premiered at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival, where it was the Opening Canadian Gala film. It was also shown at the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival, the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, the 2007 Kingston Canadian Film Festival, the 2007 Florida Film Festival, and the 2007 G√©rardmer Fantasy Filmfest in France. It was theatrically released on March 9, 2007.  Home media  The DVD was released on October 23, 2007.  Reception   Box office  The film grossed $304,533 in North America and a total of $426,224 worldwide. Domestic DVD sales were $2.95 million.  Critical response  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 73% of 73 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review, for an average rating was 6.5/10; the consensus is, \\"Making the most of its thin premise, Fido is an occasionally touching satire that provides big laughs and enough blood and guts to please gorehounds.\\" Metacritic rated it 70/100 based on 12 reviews. Allan Walton of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette gave it 5/5 stars, and called it \\"the best zombie spoof ever.\\" Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"For a one-joke movie, Fido does a fine job exploring every possible permutation of that joke.\\" Dennis Harvey of Variety called it a \\"frisky yet strangely familiar\\" film that is amusing but does not fulfill all of its promise, and Manohla Dargis of The New York Times made it a NYT Critics' Pick, calling it a \\"ticklishly amusing satire\\" that sacrifices opportunities for satire for comedy. Geoff Pevere of the Toronto Star described the film as a \\"smartly entertaining if slightly oversweet fusion of Douglas Sirkian melodrama (and especially All That Heaven Allows), all-American fifties science fiction, George Romero chompdown and Homeland Security satire,\\" that is \\"strangely wholesome, gently splattery and adorably gory.\\" Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times called it a \\"crafty\\" and \\"deliciously funny\\" film that shows \\"there's still a lot of life left in the zombie flick.\\" Scott Weinberg of Fearnet called it \\"pretty funny, surprisingly smart, pleasant to look at, and often quite sick,\\" while Joshua Siebalt of Dread Central rated the film 4.5/5 stars and described it as \\"a damn smart film\\" that \\"works on almost every level.\\" Another genre website reviewer, Brad Miska of Bloody Disgusting, wrote that the film may be a difficult sell to hardcore horror fans, but they will enjoy the comedy, gore, and originality. Conversely, Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York rated the film 2/5 stars and called its satire tiresome and overdone. J. R. Jones of the Chicago Reader wrote that it is a \\"tired spoof\\" based on a throwaway gag from Shaun of the Dead, and Rob Nelson of The Village Voice called it an unfunny zombie parody that pales in comparison to 28 Weeks Later.

It was previously known as the Advanced Research and Development Activity (ARDA). In December 2007, DTO was folded into the newly created IARPA. ARDA was created in 1998 after the model of DARPA by the Director of Central Intelligence and the Department of Defense, and took responsibility for funding some of DARPA's projects. ARDA evaluates proposals and funds speculative research, particularly in the fields of data mining, video processing, and quantum computing. There has been speculation that the DTO is continuing research efforts started under the Total Information Awareness program (TIA) in DARPA's Information Awareness Office (IAO). Data-mining activities within the US Department of Defense are controversial and have met with public and congressional disapproval. Although ARDA's budget is presumably classified as part of the intelligence budget, the New York Times quoted an unnamed former government official saying the agency spent about $100 million a year in 2003. The Associated Press reports that ARDA had a staff of only eight in 2004. Headquartered at Fort George G. Meade in Maryland, site of the headquarters of the National Security Agency, ARDA/DTO has kept a low profile, quietly funding research of interest to the intelligence community. A move to a research park near the University of Maryland, College Park was announced at about the same time as the consolidation into IARPA.

Tennessee House of Representatives Niceley served in the Tennessee House from 1988 to 1992 (96th and 97th Tennessee General Assemblies). He was elected again in 2004 to serve in the 104th General Assembly, and won re-election in 2006 and 2008 to serve in the 105th and 106th General Assemblies. During his time as a State Representative, he has been a member of the House Agriculture Committee, the House Conservation and Environment Committee, House Environment Subcommittee, and the House Parks and Tourism Subcommittee. Locally, Niceley serves with the Farm Bureau, which enables financial services to farmers, and the National Rifle Association. Niceley has argued against making cockfighting a felony in Tennessee and helped defeat a bill that would have increased the $50 fine for cockfighting to $2,500, saying that cockfighting is a cultural tradition. He said: \\"They pay their taxes. They're not bothering anybody.

She was known as the \\"cripple suffragette\\" as she campaigned in a tricycle. Early life She was born in 1875 in Lewisham, London, the second of nine children of Henry Farncombe Billinghurst and Rosa Ann (Brinsmead) Billinghurst. Her mother came from a family who manufactured pianos and her father was a banker. As a child she survived polio which left her unable to walk. She wore leg-irons and used either crutches or a modified tricycle. She became active in social work in a Greenwich workhouse, teaching in a Sunday School and joining the temperance Band of Hope. Politics She was an active member of the Women's Liberal Association and later in 1907 a member of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). She took part in the WSPU's march to the Royal Albert Hall in June 1908. Billinghurst helped organise the WSPU's response in the Haggerston by-election in July 1908, polling was on the day that twenty-four suffragettes were released from Holloway prison and came round the area canvassing to 'keep the Liberal out.' She was assumed to be the wheelchair user, in 1909, seen distracting a police horse by Annie Barnes, who laughed as another woman seemed to tip the rider off and he fell in the horse trough; the wheelchair occupier was the one arrested and rough handled into a waiting police van. Billinghurst demonstrating Two years later, she founded the Greenwich branch of the WSPU. As its first Secretary she took part in the 'Black Friday' demonstrations. She was able to attend because she used an adapted tricycle. She was still arrested after the police had capsized her from the trike. Billinghurst knew that she was helpless when this happened but she was quite prepared to take the added publicity to benefit the suffrage cause. The police also exploited her disability leaving her in a side street after letting her tyres down and pocketing the valves. Billinghurst was able to get closer to the House of Commons on another occasion in 1911, when police thought the better of attacking her trike with 'Votes for Women' banner during the rush. She is also thought to have been one of the suffragettes to evade the 1911 census on the night of Sunday 2 April 1911 in response to the calls from suffragette organisations for a boycott. suffragette force feeding in prison Billinghurst would place her crutches on both sides of her tricycle and would charge any opposition. She was arrested several more times in the next few years. The Glaswegian suffragette, Janie Allan, apparently worked in partnership with Billinghurst during the window-smashing campaign of March 1912, with Billinghurst apparently hiding a supply of stones under the rug that covered her knees. Billinghurst's first stint in Holloway Prison was for smashing a window on Henrietta Street during this campaign, for which she was sentenced to one month's hard labour. The prison authorities were confused when she was sentenced to one month hard labour and gave her no extra work. She was befriended by the many other prisoners including Dr Alice Stewart Ker who got her to smuggle a letter out to her daughter when Billinghurst was released. On 8 January 1913, she was tried at the Old Bailey and sentenced to eight months in Holloway Prison for damaging letters in a postbox. She subsequently went on hunger strike, and was force-fed along with other suffragettes. She became so ill that she was released two weeks after being force fed. Billinghurst had been given a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour'. She spoke at a public meeting in West Hampstead in March 1913. On 24 May she chained herself to the gates of Buckingham Palace and on 14 June she was dressed in white on her trike in Emily Wilding Davison's funeral procession after she became a martyr to the cause. Billinghurst also took part in the mass deputation of suffragettes to petition King George V on 21 May 1914. Though she was not arrested, two policemen deliberately tipped her out of her tricycle, and another suffragette, Charlotte Drake, had to lift her back into it. Billinghurst supported the Pankhurst's lead when they decided to prioritise the war over the campaign for women's rights. She helped in Christabel Pankhurst's campaign to be elected in Smethwick in 1918. She had however joined the Women's Freedom League and became part of the Suffragette Fellowship. She supported Jill Craigie's Equal Pay Film Fund. Billinghurst stopped her activity for women's suffrage after Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918 gave some women the vote. She later attended Emmeline Pankhurst's funeral and the unveiling of Emmeline's statue in 1930. Family In 1911, she was residing with her parents at 7 Oakhurst Road, Lewisham. Billinghurst lived in the garden house of her property \\"Minikoi\\", Sunbury, Surrey (but then in Middlesex), with her adopted child, \\"Beth\\". Beth has since written a book describing her relationship with her adoptive mother. Her brother was Alfred John Billinghurst, an artist whom she lived with after 1914. Death She died on 29 July 1953 at a hospital in Twickenham,Hayley Trueman, 'Billinghurst, (Rosa) May (1875‚Äì1953)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 9 Oct 2017 leaving her body to science.

The band has over 300 members and is the second oldest in the Big Ten Conference, with its founding in 1870. Notable music educator Leonard Falcone directed the band from 1927 through 1967. The band performs every year at home football games, travels to some away games, as well as various events held by the university. The band has also performed for five U.S. Presidents, performed at five Rose Bowls, two World's Fairs, and one World Series.Official website of the Spartan Marching Band Accessed 7/12/06. History  Beginnings and MAC military band  The band was founded in 1870 as a 10-member student-led group, shortly after the founding of the Michigan Agricultural College (presently Michigan State University). Ransom McDonough Brooks was a student and former civil war veteran who first led the band. The band operated informally during this time. In 1885, an ROTC was formed on campus and the band was reorganized as a cadet military band. During this time the band was led by students and military officers, including cornetist I.E. Hill, and Professor B.G. Edgerton, who was the first to lead the band in performance before a President Theodore Roosevelt in 1907. Other directors in this period included A.J. Clark, Frederick Abel, J.S. Taylor, and Carl Kuhlman. Taylor would lead the first band to perform the new college fight song, written by cheerleader Francis Lankey. That performance would come shortly after young Lankey's death in 1919. The Falcone years In 1927, Leonard Falcone started as director of the band. Falcone was an Italian immigrant and the brother of University of Michigan band director Nicholas Falcone. Many of the band's traditions were established during his 40-year tenure and the band changed from a 65-member ROTC auxiliary into an adjunct of the new department that would become today's College of Music. When the career of Nicholas came to a premature end due to illness in 1935, Leonard would earn the distinction of being the only person to direct the bands at both of the rival schools concurrently. MSU began playing Big 10 Conference football in 1952 and during this time the band received its first green and white uniforms. The SMB made their first appearance in the Rose Bowl in 1954. Falcone was a baritone horn virtuoso, professor of baritone and euphonium, and a prolific transcriber and arranger of music for concert band. He arranged and rearranged the fight song continuously throughout his career. Falcone drastically increased the visibility of the band through an aggressive schedule of performances and trips. He added 3 US Presidential performances to the band's resume as well as 3 televised Rose Parade and game performances in the 50s and 60s. There was a band shell on the campus where Bessey Hall stands today that was the site of regular band concerts for many years. From 1960 to 1969, Bill Moffit was assistant director of the band alongside Falcone. Moffit developed the \\"Patterns in Motion\\" drill movement concept, centered around a 4-person squad system during this time, including the current pregame drill used by the band. After Falcone's retirement, Moffit had started a position as the director of the Purdue All-American Marching Band and in 1984, took the Purdue band to Falcone's neighbourhood the morning before a football game to perform on the street.Michigan State University Archives ‚Äì Leonard Falcone collection Falcone retired and took on a role as professor emeritus in 1967, though he remained a fixture around the campus until weeks before his death in 1985. 1970s to modern day The band was the 1988 recipient of the Sudler Trophy for collegiate marching bands, administered by the John Philip Sousa Foundation. In 1989, John Madden became director of the band, and after his retirement in 2017, became the second-longest-serving director in band history, 28 years. During his tenure, the band traveled to 17 bowl games, 2 presidential performances and some foreign. Upon his retirement, he earned the distinction of Professor Emeritus and Emeritus Director of the SMB. The current director is Dr. David Thornton who was a former masters and doctoral student at MSU, and was the assistant director for the 2015 and 2016 seasons. Former band directors * A.J.

Instead, E-flat cornets play the high \\"woodwind-like\\" parts. Flutes and clarinets were phased out in the early 1960s as Spartan Stadium expanded and more sound was desired. The E-flat cornet in the SMB instrumentation is reminiscent of the standard British brass band tradition. E-flat alto horns were used until 1980. They were replaced in 1981 by standard mellophones (in F). Bass trombones now (added fall 2018) enhance the trombone section's low end. In today's SMB, all instruments are provided to members. The presence of \\"like instruments\\" has further enhanced the sound of the band, as well as creating a uniform look with silver-plated instruments. * 1 or 2 Drum Majors * 1 to 3 Feature Twirlers * 40 member color guard * 34 Alto Saxophones * 18 Tenor Saxophones * 8 E flat Cornets * 52 B Flat Trumpets * 28 Mellophones * 36 Trombones (+ 4 B Tbns) * 18 Baritones * 24 Sousaphones * 18 Big Ten Flags * 10 or 11 Snare Drums (11 during the 2019 season; 10 for previous seasons) * 5 or 6 Tenor Drums * 7 Bass Drums * 10 Cymbals Organization  Current Director  In 2017, Dr. David Thornton, who previously served as the Associate Director of the Spartan Marching Band in 2015 and 2016, was appointed Director of the Spartan Marching Band and Associate Director of Bands at MSU.Cody, Jason.

Instructors and Graduate Assistants Working directly under the director are graduate assistants and various instructors. Instructors are typically paid positions and their duties include visual, color guard and percussion. Graduate assistants are graduate students from the MSU College of Music who arrange music, design drill, rehearse music, and teach on the field in preparation for halftime and pregame shows. Administratively, graduate assistants conduct challenges and auditions. Drum Major(s) Drum Major Ian McNabb performing the traditional drum major backbend during pregame Typically, the Spartan Marching Band has only one drum major for the entire ensemble. However, in years when the drum major is a graduating senior there are two, allowing the new drum major to have one season of apprenticeship. The position is chosen through an audition process. The drum major and band president are the top ranking student leaders in the organization. The \\"Voice of the Band\\" The Announcer for the Spartan Marching Band is also known as the \\"Voice of the Band.\\" Throughout the years, the band has only had a few people in this position. \\"The Voice\\" introduces the band during Pre-Game, Halftime and Postgame, as well as special events, pep rallies, and Spartan Spectacular, in addition to traveling with the band on away trips and bowl games. Gameday traditions  Morning of Game Day Practice  The Spartan Marching Band starts every home game day with rehearsal. This practice is open to the public and is a great way for those who cannot attend the football game to see that week's marching band show live. Game day rehearsal times differ due to the start time of the game, but can begin as early as 7 am for noon game days. Student Bookstore Performance Before meeting the rest of the band on Adams Field, approximately two hours before kickoff, the Spartan Marching Band Drumline performs for a crowd in the median on Grand River Road in front of the Student Bookstore (commonly known as SBS). Pieces played include \\"Martian Mambo,\\" \\"Ditty,\\" \\"Band Day Beat,\\" \\"The Series,\\" and \\"X,\\" the latter of which was composed by Drumline Instructor Jon Weber. Concert on Adams Field Before all home games the band performs a free concert on Walter Adams Field (formerly Landon Field) next to the music building. The concert usually begins 1.5‚Äì2 hours before kickoff. The Series \\"The Series\\" is the name of the percussion cadence (\\"street beat\\") used by the SMB for parade marching. It is composed of seven different cadences strung together (in series) in march tempo. The co-composers are Merritt Lutz and Joel Leach. It was finalized in 1966. Each cadence has a unique set of maneuvers specific to each section‚Äîthe tubas, for example, will have horn flashes during one cadence, while the trumpets will perform different horn flashes during another. The Series is extremely intricate and requires hours of practice (in addition to regular pre-season rehearsals) by new members to memorize their section's moves. It uses a full high step throughout (with the exception of the drumline and the color guard), and combined with the intricacy of the upper body movements and vocals, is one of the most physically demanding and uniquely recognizable trademarks of the SMB. This is the cadence used as the band marches to Spartan Stadium each game day. Thousands of fans line the Kalamazoo Street bridge to cheer on the band as they march to the stadium. The Kickstep The Kickstep is a very fast field entrance which has become a trademark of the SMB. It was established in 1950 or 51, with the physical marching steps invented by trumpet player Herb VanDyke of Muskegon. The cadence (drum part) origin is not known. Performed at 220 beats per minute, the kickstep is a run- on routine choreographed in eight-count segments with horn, knee, and hand accents on counts two and four. The kickstep is a highly strenuous physical routine which requires intensive practice and conditioning. Spinning the \\"S\\" This is a drill move performed by the Spartan Marching Band during the pregame show while playing the Michigan State University fight song. While playing the breakstrain of the fight song, marching band shifts to a hollow Block \\"S\\" formation, with the final shape popping up and charging down the field at the exact moment that the chorus of the song begins. The four-man \\"squad\\" drill that is unique to the Spartan Marching Band causes the \\"S\\" to appear as though it is being \\"spun\\" as the marching band shifts to position. The 7-up As the Spartan Marching Band plays the fight song during parade marching and the pregame routine, all of the instrumentalists and auxiliary performers execute an eight-count horn swing with an accented upward movement on the 8th count. New members learn this maneuver as a \\"7-up\\", counted as such: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - UP! Visitor's fight song A Big Ten tradition, during every pregame show the SMB performs the opposing team's fight song upfield towards the visitor's section. In Spartan Stadium and wherever the band travels, from Hawaii to arch-rival Michigan, the SMB considers it a point of pride and respect to play the opposition's fight song with the utmost musicality.\\"Rival bands in harmony mutual respect can be heard in today's U-M. MSU game.\\"Detroit Free Press, September 26, 1998 Third quarter cheer Between the third and fourth quarters of home football games, the percussion section performs their \\"third quarter cheer\\" in the southeast endzone. The show varies by year and is a favorite among the student section. Postgame Show After every home game, the Spartan Marching Band takes the field one last time to perform selections from the day's halftime show. In addition, the band often performs a favorite postgame tune, usually Carlos Santana's \\"Everybody's Everything\\". If the visiting team's band is in attendance, they may also participate in the post-game concert if their schedule permits. Postgame shows traditionally end with MSU's alma mater and fight song to round out another Spartan football experience. After the postgame show, the band may march the Series out of Spartan Stadium to Demonstration Hall, then leave formation to gather together for the final tradition of game day.  Postgame Dismissal  Here, after words of wisdom, kindness and correction by band director, members of the SMB sing the alma mater, MSU Shadows, a cappella, in four-part harmony. After dismissal by drum major(s), the official game day traditions are complete. If the visiting band is still present at this point in the day, an informal reception may follow and the percussion sections of both bands often join in an impressive drum off that is always a crowd favorite. Big Ten Flags The Big Ten Flag Corps is a pre-game and parade tradition in the Spartan Marching Band that was added in 1967. Members carry large banner type flags on lance poles, which salute the fourteen universities in the Big Ten Conference. The section consists of dedicated, hard-working, and athletic individuals who carry out unique traditions that exhibit the style and form of the Spartan Marching Band. Other traditions Preseason Drills Preseason drills begin 10 days before the beginning of classes. During this week, new members can spend over 120 hours practicing. Percussionists and Color Guard members arrive ten days before the start of classes, followed by section leaders, squad leaders, and the drum major(s) for classroom leadership training. New members arrive next, receiving detailed fundamental instructions, and the remaining veteran members arrive last. Typically, music and field rehearsals begin at 8:30 A.M. and last, with breaks, until 8:50 P.M. New members of the SMB are required to attend \\"freshmen orientation\\" sessions and rehearsals inside Demonstration Hall for 3 or 4 evenings from 9 P.M. to 11 P.M. Preseason Drills end with a lighter schedule on the day before classes start. On this day uniforms are inspected and full-band/section pictures occur in uniform, essentially creating a dress rehearsal for the proper wearing of the uniform. A practice \\"march to the stadium\\" usually occurs (not in uniform) on the Monday before the first home game, followed by an in the stands rehearsal to end preseason drills. Memorized music The Spartan Marching Band learns a new halftime show for every home game of the season. All members are expected to have their music memorized by Thursday of the week of the game. Any member, despite rank in the block, may be pulled out of a show for that week for not having music or the marching drill memorized. Full-sized flip-folders are never used. All freshmen and veterans assigned to a new part must play all the MSU bleacher cheers and pregame music for their section leaders from memory by the end of Freshmen Dress Rehearsal, or forfeit their place in the block, becoming an alternate. MSU Shadows Every band member must learn the MSU alma mater, MSU Shadows, which was arranged by MSC Music Professor H. Owen Reed, with words by coach Barney Traynor. Sung in four-part harmony, MSU Shadows was introduced in 1948 and is played and/or sungRecordings, Falcone collection, Archives of Michigan State University by the band. After marching to Spartan Stadium, the band gathers near the tunnel leading onto the football field and sings before lining up for the pregame Kickstep entrance. It is always played during the Pregame performance. MSU Shadows is also sung at the end of game days, after marching back and usually performing for the sizable crowd of band fans. After the final home game of the year after the seniors sing the infrequently-sung second verse, the content of which is about one's love for MSU remaining after graduating. MSU Shadows is also featured prominently during the annual Alumni Band Reunion Day, during which band alumni gather from around the world to perform at halftime during a home game. Sparty Watch Sparty Watch is a band-sponsored event beginning Monday night before the University of Michigan game and ending the evening after the game. Sparty Watch is a 24-hours/day guard of the Spartan statue to prevent vandalism. The football coach has been known to show up with food for the hungry band members camped out in the cold. High School Band Day High School Band Day was a long-running tradition in Spartan Stadium where high school bands from across the state were invited to perform during a home game halftime. The first Band Day was held on November 6, 1954. In its heyday, the event gathered more than 3,000 musicians. After nearly forty years, the tradition ended in 2001. Then for a brief period, the SMB hosted the popular \\"Spartan Invitational,\\" a field show format exhibition where HS Bands from across the region performed for thousands of appreciative fans, as well as for select adjudicators from across the country. The event was no longer feasible as Spartan Stadium went back to a natural grass surface. Travel Away games The full Spartan Marching Band will travel to one or more away games per year, depending on proximity of away games and invitations to travel. Travel to the University of Notre Dame and the University of Michigan have occurred regularly throughout the band's history. Bowl games The Spartan Marching Band enjoys a long-standing tradition of traveling to bowl games. There is no further audition required for band members; all members are required to participate in the travel (which is not the case in other Big Ten bands). There is no cost to students. Bowl appearances for the Spartan Band include: 2015 College Football Playoff Cotton Bowl, 2015 Cotton Bowl, 1954, 1956, 1966, 1988, and 2014 Rose Bowls(Rose Bowl) Pasadena California;\\"Play band!

He was born in Florence, where remained active until his death in 1498. Although there are only few documented works by Botticini, a considerable corpus has been confidently attributed to him on the basis of style including a number of altarpieces, dozens of small-scale religious panels and a few portraits.  Life   Early work  Botticini was born in Florence in 1446. His father was Giovanni di Domenico di Piero, a naibaio, or painter of playing cards, from whom he probably received his initial artistic training. By 22 July 1459 was a salaried assistant in the workshop of Neri di Bicci. Botticini left Neri's workshop in 24 July 1460. He eventually came into contact with Andrea del Verrocchio, in whose workshop he would have met Leonardo da Vinci, Lorenzo di Credi, Domenico Ghirlandaio, and Pietro Perugino. Though Botticini's presence in Verrocchio's studio is not documented, it is often inferred on the basis of style. Botticini opened his own workshop by 1469, as reported in an arbitration document from that year. He remained close with his father, who oversaw his working contracts until 1475, when he filed for emancipation. The emancipation was granted in 1477, according to legal records. Saint Nicolas Enthroned between Saints Catherine, Lucy, Margaret and Apollonia, circa 1465. Tokyo, National Museum of Western Art. Botticini's earliest works include the Saint Nicholas and Four Female Saints at the National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo, a Saint Sebastian at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and a Madonna adoring the Child at the Birmingham Museum of Art in Alabama. His earliest dated work is an altarpiece of the Madonna and Child with Saints Sebastian, Pancras, Sebastian and Peter (1471) at the Mus√©e Jacquemart-Andr√©, Paris, which is painted under the strong influence of Verrocchio. The Saint Monica Enthroned with Augustinian Nuns in Santo Spirito, Florence, is usually dated also dated to this year, as his the famous Three Archangels with the Young Tobias at the Uffizi.  Maturity  By 1475 Botticini had developed a more personal style, which he first expressed in his most famous work, the large Assumption of the Virgin at the National Gallery, London. Wrongly attributed Botticelli in Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Artists, this painting has been unanimously attributed to Botticini since the early twentieth century. The attribution is corroborated by extant documents, which state how the painting was begun in 1475 and completed in 1477. The picture was commissioned by the poet Matteo Palmieri and his wife Niccolosa, presumably for their burial chapel in the now-destroyed church of San Pier Maggiore, Florence. However, some scholars believe it was instead intended for Palmieri's chapel in the Badia Fiesolana (outside Florence) because the dimensions are almost the same as Hans Memling's Last Judgment, a work initially intended for the Badia but later stolen and taken to Gdansk, Poland. Several preparatory drawings for Botticini's altarpiece survive in various collections.375x375px The altarpiece's unusual composition and subject was surely dictated by its patrons, who appear in the lower corners of the composition. The background includes a view of Florence and the Arno valley. Some of Palmieri's properties on the hills of Fiesole, such as the farm included in his wife's dowry, are clearly discernible. The interpretation of Mary's bodily assumption into heaven, with the Virgin welcomed by rings of angels and saints, is based on the last stanza of Palmeri's poem, the Citt√† di Vita (1465). The poem describes a controversial Lucretian idea that the soul began in heaven and descended to earth, without being crafted by God. Vasari wrote that Botticini's Assumption, like Palmieri's poem, was considered heretical and thus covered soon after its completion. This claim is likely fictitious but the donors' faces have indeed been scratched out, clearly indicating the controversies that surrounded Palmieri's ideas. In the 1480s Botticini was consistently employed in Florence as well as nearby Empoli. For Empoli's collegiata church of Sant'Andrew he created two large tabernacles, one dedicated to Saint Sebastian and the other the Holy Sacrament. Both tabernacles are today in the adjoining museum. The larger of the two, theTabernacle of the Sacrament, was commissioned in 1486 and was largely complete by 1491, when it was installed on the church's high altar. In 1504, however, Botticini's son Raffaello was called in to add the finishing touches. Several preparatory drawings survive for the draperies of the saints in the side panels.277x277px269x269px alt=In 1488 Botticini painted an altarpiece of the Piet√† with Four Saints for the meeting room of the Confraternity of San Domenico del Giglio at the basilica of Santa Maria Novella, Florence, now at the Mus√©e Jacquemart-Andr√©, Paris. Throughout his career, Botticini painted numerous panels with religious subjects for the homes of Florentine citizens. He was especially popular as a painter of tondi, or circular pictures, invariably of the Virgin and the young Saint John the Baptist, patron saint of Florence, kneeling in adoration of the Christ Child. One such example, in remarkably fine condition, appeared at Sotheby's, London, in 2013. Others can be found at the Galleria Palatina, Florence; the Louvre, Paris; and the Museo Soumaya, Mexico City.  Late work  Botticini continued to work throughout the last during the last decade of his career, receiving important commissions for Florence and its surroundings. Around 1490 he painted the Madonna and Child in Glory with Saints Mary Magdalen and Bernard, formerly at theFlorentine church of the Cestello and now at the Louvre, and in 1493 he painted a Madonna and Child with Two Angels and Saints Benedict, Francis, Sylvester and Anthony Abbot for the Compagnia della Vergine in Fucecchio (west of Florence), now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In the mid-1490s he completed his most ambitious late altarpiece, an imposing Saint Jerome with Saints and Angels (the San Gerolamo Altarpiece), commissioned by wealthy Rucellai family for the convent of San Girolamo, Fiesole. This work, now at the National Gallery in London, depicts Saint Jerome in the central panel between Pope Damasus, Saint Eusebius, Saint Paula and Saint Eustochium; six angels appear in the sky above and a group of donors kneel below. The painting is unusual for including the central saint in a separate frame, creating a sort of picture-within-a-picture. As described by art critic Charles Darwent, \\"By giving his picture-within-a-picture of St Jerome its own gilt frame, the artist (Botticini) sets up a sequence of overlapping realities. The framed image exists as a separate artwork for us, the viewer, but also for the painted saints who seem to study it: even holy martyrs, it says, can be moved by the power of art.\\" A drawing once considered a study for the figure of the Saint Jerome in the altarpiece is now recognized as a work by Domenico Ghirlandaio and linked to a fresco of the saint at the Bargello, Florence, painted by Ghirlandaio's brother-in-law, Bastiano Mainardi.left In 1495 Botticini painted an altarpiece of the Madonna and Child with Saint Francis, the Archangel Raphael and the Young Tobias for the Rinuccini chapel in San Pier Scheraggio, Florence. This work is now at the National Galleries of Scotland, Edinburgh, on loan from a private collection. Botticini died in Florence on 16 January 1498 at the age of 51. His workshop was inherited by his son Raffaello Botticini, who had a prolific activity of his own.  Posthumous reputation  In April 1968, Esquire Magazine imitated Botticini's Saint Sebastian at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in a cover shot of Muhammad Ali. The cover was meant to relate the persecution of Saint Sebastian to that of Muhammad Ali, when we was stripped of his heavyweight boxing title for refusing to serve in the Vietnam War. George Lois, the magazine's art director at the time, came up with the idea and pitched it to Ali. Ali initially liked the connection between the suffering of the Saint and himself, but initially refused to pose as a Christian. He eventually agreed after speaking with the leader of the Nation of Islam, Elijah Muhammad, and studying a postcard of Botticini's painting. The final product shows Ali with his hands bound behind him, arrows piercing his torso, his head tilted upwards in pain, in imitation of Botticini's saint.

History of Catholicism in Estonia At the beginning of the 13th century, Estonia was conquered by the German Teutonic Order during the Livonian Crusade and thus was one of the last territories in Europe to be Christianized. However, some archaeological evidence suggests that Christianity was already known centuries prior to the conquest. Based on archaeological relics, such as crosses and metal book corners, some areas of Estonia were Christian prior to the 13th century. The whole of Estonia was subjugated by the year 1227 and, until the mid 16th century, Estonia was divided among feudal landlords and, thus, Catholic territory, although not yet unified. During the Livonian War, medieval Estonia was conquered by the Swedes, initially occupying northern Estonia and, later, the southern part. Swedish rule, from 1561‚Äì1710, banned Catholicism for the benefit of the Lutheran Church. In the Great Northern War Sweden lost Estonia to Russia, which governed the land from 1710 to 1918. Imperial Russia granted vast privileges to the resident Baltic-German nobility of Estonia, including freedom to practice their Lutheran faith. During the 18th century, Polish and then Lithuanian Catholic noblemen started to make their own use of this right. The first Catholic mass, after more than a hundred years, was held on 18 January 1786. There were less than 300 Catholics in Estonia at that time. Catholicism began its revival. On 26 December 1845, the new Catholic Church of Tallinn was consecrated, followed by the new Catholic Church of Tartu in 1899. In 1918, when Estonia gained independence, Estonian citizens had complete freedom of religion. The Holy See recognized Estonia on 10 October 1921. In 1931 Eduard Profittlich, S.J. became the apostolic administrator for the Catholic Church in Estonia. In 1936 he was consecrated as the first Estonian Catholic bishop since the Lutheran reformation in the 16th century. Before World War II broke out, there were almost 5,000 Catholics in Estonia (Tallinn: 2.333, Tartu: 1.073, Narva: ca. 600, Valga: ca. 800). In 1940 Estonia was invaded by the Soviets and organised religion was prohibited. The majority of the 5000 Catholic faithful either escaped the country or were imprisoned in Soviet prison camps. They arrested Bishop Profittlich who subsequently died in a Soviet prison in Siberia in 1942 after being sentenced to death as a Vatican spy. His cause for canonization as a Martyr has been opened. During the Soviet occupation, all Estonia's Catholic churches were closed and the Catholic population of Estonia decreased below 100 adherents and 1 underground priest who were all heavily persecuted by the KGB. Tartu Catholic Church After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Estonia regained its independence and was re- recognized by the Holy See on 28 August 1991. Estonia received its first Papal visit when Pope John Paul II visited the country in September 1993. Current state of Catholicism in Estonia The Catholic population of Estonia is small, however has seen a rapid increase since the end of the Soviet rule. Currently the whole country has approximately 6,000 adherents. Most are of Estonian background but also many Lithuanians and Poles. Most live in the major towns such as Tallinn, Tartu, and Narva.

Life and career Born in Zouar in the Tibesti Mountains, he came from the northern Muslim population of the country. Togo√Ømi served as in a number of positions during the presidency of Idriss D√©by: he was Minister of Justice from 1990 to 1993, Minister of Defence from 1995 to 1997, and was then appointed Minister of the Interior on 21 May 1997.\\"May 1997 ‚Äì New Attack\\", Keesing's Record of World Events, volume 43, May 1997, page 41,626. Shortly after the latter appointment, he resigned from the government on 3 June 1997. He said that his resignation came about because of what he described as the \\"dictatorial drift\\" of the government. Togo√Ømi's break with D√©by has also been interpreted in ethnic terms, based on his own status as a Toubou and D√©by's status as a Zaghawa. On 12 October 1998, he formed the Movement for Democracy and Justice in Chad (MDJT), a dissident rebel group that sought to overthrow the government, initially with the support of Libya. Operating initially from his power base in the Tibesti Mountains, the group waged a guerilla war against government forces. He was re-elected as party leader at a party congress in Sabha, Libya in December 2001\\"Chad: Peace agreement of 7 January 2002 between the government and MDJT rebels; implementation of the terms of the agreement, release of prisoners and any amnesty given to rebels; whether the terms of the agreement extend to all members and sympathizers of the MDJT\\", Research Directorate, Immigration and Refugee Board, Canada (UNHCR.org). and on 25 December he expressed a willingness to negotiate with the government. The MDJT's second vice-president Adoum Togoi signed a peace agreement with the government in Tripoli, Libya, on 7 January 2002. This terms of the agreement involved, among other things, a cease-fire, inclusion of the MDJT in the government, and integration of its fighters into the army. An amnesty for MDJT members was approved by the National Assembly of Chad in late February. A month later, the agreement began to break down as the government rejected MDJT demands, including its proposal for new prime minister from the MDJT. In May, Togoi, who was viewed as a moderate in the group, was allegedly ambushed, injured and kidnapped by Togo√Ømi, who was viewed as a hard-liner, an apparent result of a split in the group regarding how to handle the peace negotiations, and late in the month the first fighting since the signing of the peace agreement broke out. Togo√Ømi was injured by a land mine in late August in the Tibesti area and he died from his wounds in Tripoli on 24 September 2002. Mockhtar Wawa Dahab, a spokesman for the Chadian government, responded to the death by stating that it \\"ought to make it easier for peace to return to Chad\\".

He previously played for Sancti Spiritus in the Cuban league and the Yokohama DeNA BayStars of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). Gurriel is a former member of Cuba's national team. Always a versatile infielder, he has played shortstop, second base, and third base, but has played mostly first base with the Astros. The son of former Cuban player Lourdes Gurriel, Yulieski was regarded as the best player in Cuba in 2006. At the World Baseball Classic in 2006, Major League Baseball scouts projected that Gurriel would be a first-round draft pick if he were eligible for the draft. He defected from Cuba in 2016. Gurriel made his big league debut that year. Baseball career Cuban career Gurriel had a solid season during the 2004‚Äì05 Cuban National Series, leading the league in hits and runs. However, he truly dominated in 2005‚Äì06, leading the series in RBIs, runs, and triples. His 27 home runs, which also led the league, were one short of the record of 28. Gurriel's batting average was .327, and his slugging percentage was .676. He played his Cuban career with Sancti Sp√≠ritus and Industriales of the Cuban National Series. Cuban national team  Gurriel's contributions helped the national team win a gold medal in the 2004 Summer Olympics and World Cup of Baseball championships in 2003 and 2005. During the 2005 World Cup, he led all batters with eight home runs. Gurriel played second base for the Cuban national baseball team in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, making the final out for Cuba in their championship game loss to Japan. He batted .273 in the tournament, with a .342 on-base percentage and a .515 slugging percentage. Later in the finals of the 2008 Beijing Olympics tournament, he again made the final out, by grounding into a double play against South Korea. Gurriel played for Cuba again in the 2009 World Baseball Classic, as their third baseman. He batted .333 in the tournament with two home runs and 6 RBIs. Japan  On May 11, 2014, Gurriel signed a one-year contract with the Yokohama DeNA BayStars. He joined the team at midseason, and batted .305 with 11 home runs and 30 RBIs in 62 games. Defection from Cuba In February 2016, Gurriel and his 22-year-old brother, Lourdes Gurriel Jr., defected after competing in the Caribbean World Series in the Dominican Republic. In June, Major League Baseball declared Gurriel eligible to be signed by a major league team as a free agent. Nearly ten years prior, ESPN.com had erroneously reported that Gurriel and another Cuban national player, Eduardo Paret, had defected from Cuba and into Colombia. Gurriel refuted this claim on August 1, 2006, stating that he returned to his home in Cuba immediately after the conclusion of the tournament the Cuban national team had been playing in. Houston Astros On July 16, 2016, Gurriel signed a five-year, $47.5 million contract with the Houston Astros. He made his American debut in July with the Gulf Coast Astros of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, playing in two games. He was then promoted to the Lancaster JetHawks of the Class A-Advanced California League. After playing in four games for Lancaster, the Astros promoted Gurriel to the Corpus Christi Hooks of the Class AA Texas League. He batted 2-for-17 (.118) in five games for Corpus Christi, and was promoted to the Fresno Grizzlies of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. He was recalled from Fresno to the major league roster on August 21. In his first 19 games with the Astros, he batted .344 with three home runs and eight runs batted in, playing mostly first and third base defensively. On May 1, he performed a dynamic \\"swim slide\\" into second base to help defeat the Texas Rangers. In 2017 he batted .299/.332/.486. He had the lowest number of pitches per plate appearance in the major leagues (3.43). In Game 3 of the 2017 World Series, Gurriel hit a home run off Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Yu Darvish, and upon returning to the dugout, made a racist gesture mocking the pitcher. Gurriel was caught on camera stretching the sides of his eyes and mouthing the Spanish word chinito, which translates to \\"little Chinese Boy\\". Gurriel apologized, and said that anyone from Asia is called a chino in Cuba, although he acknowledged that he knew the term was offensive from having played in Japan. Gurriel was suspended for the first five games of the 2018 season without pay, but not for the World Series. He was required to undergo sensitivity training in the offseason. The Astros said that they would donate Gurriel's salary lost during the suspension to a charity that supports diversity efforts.\\"Gurriel won't be suspended for any World Series games\\". espn.com. October 28, 2017. Retrieved October 28, 2017. It has since been reported by Ken Rosenthal and Evan Drellich that the Astros were cheating at the very time that Gurriel used this racial slur to mock Darvish's performance, which was directly hindered by the cheating. > The Astros‚Äô set-up in 2017 was not overly complicated. A feed from a camera > in center field, fixed on the opposing catcher‚Äôs signs, was hooked up to a > television monitor that was placed on a wall steps from the team‚Äôs home > dugout at Minute Maid Park, in the tunnel that runs between the dugout and > the clubhouse. Team employees and players would watch the screen during the > game and try to decode signs ‚Äî sitting opposite the screen on massage tables > in a wide hallway. In Game 5, Gurriel hit a three-run home run off Dodgers star pitcher Clayton Kershaw in the fourth inning to tie the game 4‚Äì4; the Astros would go on to win 13‚Äì12. In Game 7, Gurriel faced Darvish again, and tipped his helmet before his at bat as a respectful gesture. The Astros won the game 5‚Äì1, giving them their first world championship in franchise history. After each hitting two home runs on September 21, 2018, Gurriel and brother Lourdes, Jr., became the first pair of brothers to hit multi-home run games in the major leagues on the same day; Lourdes' was as a member of the Toronto Blue Jays. Yuli Gurriel was named AL Player of the Week for the first time on September 23, 2018, having batted .462, .923 SLG, eight runs scored, three home runs, and 10 RBI. For the 2018 season, he batted .291/.323/.428. Gurriel became the first Astro with a run and RBI in seven consecutive games, and the fifth to homer in five consecutive games, on July 7, 2019, including a game-tying grand slam in doing so in an 11‚Äì10 win versus the Los Angeles Angels. He won the AL Player of the Week Award for the week ending July 8, his second weekly honor, after homering in all five of the Astros games for a total of six, among nine hits and an OPS of 1.812. He went on to win the AL Player of the Month Award for July, his first time, after batting .398, .427 OBP, .837 SLG, 18 runs scored, seven doubles, 12 home runs, 31 RBIs over 24 games. In a 14‚Äì3 romp over the Colorado Rockies on August 7, Gurriel homered and tied J. R. Towles with eight RBIs for the club record in one game. In 2019, Gurriel batted .298/.343/.541 with 31 home runs and 104 RBIs (9th in the AL) in 564 at bats.. In 2020, he batted .232/.274/.384 with 27 runs, 6 home runs, 22 RBIs, and five sacrifice flies (tied for second in the AL) in 211 at bats, playing 55 games at first base and two at DH. On September 29, 2020, the Astros signed Gurriel to a 1-year extension with a club option for 2022.  Batting profile  As a right- handed batter, Gurriel is unusual in the sense that he has a better batting average against right handed pitchers than left-handers, and is better at batting against breaking balls away from the bat, esp. sliders. Personal life His brother, Lourdes Gurriel Jr. also played in Cuba before defecting, and later signed with the Toronto Blue Jays.

Northumbria was formed from the earlier kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira. √Üthelwald Moll was King of Northumbria, the historic petty kingdom of Angles in medieval England, from 759 to 765. He seized power after the murder of Oswulf son of Eadberht; his ancestry and connection to the royal family of Northumbria is unknown. √Üthelwald faced at least one rebellion, led by Oswine, perhaps a brother of Oswulf. In 765 a Witenagemot of Northumbrian notables deposed √Üthelwald and replaced him with Alhred, a kinsman of his predecessor. After his removal from the throne √Üthelwald became a monk, perhaps involuntarily. √Üthelwald's marriage with one √Üthelthryth is recorded in 762 at Catterick by Symeon of Durham. He is known to have had at least one son, √Üthelred, who later became king. Origins √Üthelwald is not recorded in the extant genealogies of Northumbrian kings, perhaps because he was not a descendant of Ida and the Bernician kings. Whether he was a descendant of the Deiran dynasty of √Ülle, or simply a member of a powerful noble family, is unknown.Kirby, pp. 150-151; Yorke, p. 89. It is likely that he is to be identified with the patrician Moll, recorded in the reign of King Eadberht, to whom Eadberht and his brother Ecgbert, Archbishop of York, granted the monasteries of Stonegrave, Coxwold, and Donaemuthe, all in modern Yorkshire. These had belonged to Moll's brother, Abbot Forthred.Kirby, p. 150. The event is known from a letter of Pope Paul I, obtained by Abbot Forthred, which ordered Eadberht and Ecgberht to return the monasteries to Forthred. (Text). The location of Donaemuthe is uncertain. Reign On 24 July 759, King Oswulf was murdered by members of his own household. The regicide was \\"a crime in which √Üthelwald may very well have been involved.\\"Thus Williams, p. 51; see also Kirby, pp. 98 & 150, who states that he is \\"...very likely to have been associated with those who were responsible...\\". √Üthelwald was crowned King of Northumbria on 5 August 759. His reign was not unopposed. The continuator of Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum reports the death of a certain Oswine in 761. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and Symeon of Durham's Historia Regum supply more details, recording that Oswine, \\"a most noble √¶theling\\", was killed fighting against √Üthelwald on 6 August 761 in the Eildon Hills.Kirby, p. 151, states that Oswine's origins are unknown. Marsden, pp. 232-233, suggests he was a son of Eadberht. The description of Oswine as an √¶theling comes from John of Worcester's chronicle. √Üthelwald was deposed on 30 October 765, apparently by a council of noblemen and prelates held at Pincanheale, an important site used for two later Northumbrian church councils. According to the Irish Annals of Tigernach, √Üthelwald was tonsured.Symeon of Durham, p. 448; Kirby, p. 151. AT, s.a. 764, reports: \\"Moll r√≠ Saxan clericus eficitur\\" [Moll, king of the Saxons, was made a monk]. He was succeeded as king by Eadberht's son-in-law Alhred. Descendants √Üthelwald's marriage with one √Üthelthryth is recorded in 762 at Catterick by Symeon of Durham.Symeon of Durham, p. 448; Kirby, p. 150. They are known to have had at least one son, √Üthelred, who later became king. It is presumed, on onomastic grounds, that the Moll \\"slain by the urgent command of King Eardwulf\\" circa 799 was a kinsman of √Üthelwald Moll.Kirby, p.156, Symeon of Durham, p. 461.

In the United Kingdom local authorities have responsibility for the creation and maintenance of streets as well as the management of street works. The NSG brings together the knowledge spread across local authorities and is a repository for combining the Local Street Gazetteers they are required to keep. Maintenance of the NSG is covered by the National Streetworks Register legislation and is a statutory requirement of local authorities. In effect the NSG has become the definitive list of all streets in England and Wales and provides a definitive identification of all streets with the use of a Unique Street Reference Number (USRN). On a monthly basis highway authorities are required to upload their street gazetteers, along with Associated Street Data (ASD), to the NSG; a master index built to the national standard BS7666, for access by a number of other organisations via the NSG online hub and managed by GeoPlace. This enables third party organisations such as public utilities to meet their statutory requirements to provide the appropriate streetworks notifications. The NSG has exceeded its initial aims to provide a consistent and unambiguous identification of streets and their associated streetworks. The street gazetteer has become a foundation for the National Land and Property Gazetteer. It has also become the basis for Transport for London's (TfL) road network through the Pan London Street Gazetteer. Originally the NSG was managed by the national mapping agency for the UK, Ordnance Survey (OS). However, it became clear that OS was unwilling or unable to provide a rigorous management of the service. Part of this may have been because OS was operating outside of their acknowledged expertise in mapping rather than data management, although it has been suggested that OS simply saw no commercial advantage in developing the NSG. In May 2005 the Mapping Services Agreement (MSA) was signed with local authorities. This was part of a long drawn out process of procurement for mapping data and included management of the NSG and the NLPG. The outcome of agreement involved the loss of the custodianship by OS of the NSG which was awarded to the data management company Intelligent Addressing Ltd who were already managers of the NLPG.

He was sheikh of a Qadiriyah Sufi family of the Barzanji clan from the city of Sulaymaniyah, which is now in Iraqi Kurdistan. He was named King of Kurdistan during several of these uprisings. Background After World War I, the British and other Western powers occupied parts of the Ottoman Empire. Plans made with the French in the Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement designated Britain as the mandate power. The British were able to form their own borders to their pleasure to gain an advantage in this region. The British had firm control of Baghdad and Basra and the regions around these cities mostly consisted of Shiite and Sunni Arabs. In 1921, the British appointed Faisal I the King of Iraq. It was an interesting choice because Faisal had no local connections, as he was part of the Hashemite family in Western Arabia. As events were unfolding in the southern part of Iraq, the British were also developing new policies in northern Iraq, which was primarily inhabited by Kurds, and was known as Greater Kurdistan in the Paris (Versailles) Peace Conference of 1919. The borders that the British formed had the Kurds between central Iraq (Baghdad) and the Ottoman lands of the north. The Kurdish people of Iraq lived in the mountainous and terrain of the Mosul Vilayet. It was a difficult region to control from the British perspective because of the terrain and tribal loyalties of the Kurds. There was much conflict after the Great War between the Ottoman government and British on how the borders should be established. The Ottomans were unhappy with the outcome of the Treaty of S√®vres, which allowed the Great War victors control over much of the former Ottoman lands through the distribution of formerly Ottoman territory as League of Nations mandates. In particular, the Turks felt that the Mosul Vilayet was theirs because the British had illegally conquered it after the Mudros Armistice, which had ended hostilities in the war. With the discovery of oil in northern Iraq, the British were unwilling to relinquish the Mosul Vilayet. Also, it was to the British advantage to have the Kurds play a buffer role between themselves and the Ottoman Empire. All that led to the importance of Sheikh Mahmud Barzanji. The British promised the Kurds during the Great War that they would receive their own land to form a Kurdish state. However, the British did not keep their promise, which was the first of many instances the British manipulated the Kurds and lied to them. There was mistrust on the part of the Kurds. In 1919, uneasiness began to evolve in the Kurdish regions because they were unhappy with the situation the British forced upon them. The Kurds revolted a year later. The British tried to establish a puppet government in the region and so appointed a popular leader of the region, which was how Mahmud became governor of southern Kurdistan. Power and revolts Mahmud Barzanji Mahmud was a very ambitious Kurdish national leader and promoted the idea of Kurds controlling their own state and gaining independence from the British. As Charles Tripp relates, the British appointed him governor of Sulaimaniah in southern Kurdistan as a way of gaining an indirect rule in this region. The British wanted this indirect rule with the popular Mahmud at the helm, which they believed would give them a face and a leader to control and calm the region. However, with a little taste of power, Mahmud had ambitions for more for himself and for the Kurdish people. He was declared \\"King of Kurdistan\\" and claimed to be the ruler of all Kurds, but the opinion of Mahmud among Kurds was mixed because he was becoming too powerful and ambitious for some. Mahmud hoped to create Kurdistan and initially the British allowed Mahmud to pursue has ambitions because he was bringing the region and people together for the British to control. However, by 1920 Mahmud, to British displeasure, was using his power against the British by capturing British officials in the Kurd region and starting uprisings against the British. As historian Kevin McKierman writes, \\"The rebellion lasted until Mahmud was wounded in combat, which occurred on the road between Kirkuk and Sulaimaniah. Captured by British forces, he was sentenced to death but later imprisoned in a British fort in India.\\" Mahmud remained in India until 1922. Return and second revolt Mahmud Barzanji With the exile of the Sheikh in India, Turkish nationalists in the crumbling Ottoman Empire were causing a great deal of trouble in the Kurdish regions of Iraq. The Turkish nationalists, led by Mustafa Kemal, were riding high in the early 1920s after their victory against Greece and were looking to take that momentum into Iraq and take back Mosul. With the British in direct control of northern Iraq after the exile of Sheikh Mahmud, the area was becoming increasingly hostile for the British officials due to the threat from Turkey. The region was led by the Sheikh's brother, Sheikh Qadir, who was not capable of handling the situation and was seen by the British as an unstable and unreliable leader. Sir Percy Cox, a British military official and administrator to the Middle East especially Iraq, and Winston Churchill, a British politician, were at odds on whether to release the Sheikh from his exile and bring him back to reign in northern Iraq. That would allow the British to have better control over the hostile but important region. Cox argued that the British could gain authority in a region they recently evacuated, and the Sheikh was the only hope of gaining back a stable region. Cox was aware of the dangers of bringing back the Sheikh, but he was also aware that one of the main reasons for the unrest in the region was the growing perception that the earlier promises of autonomy would be abandoned and the British would bring the Kurdish people under direct rule of the Arab government in Baghdad. The Kurdish dream of an independent state was growing less likely which caused conflict in the region. Bringing the Sheikh back was their only chance of a peaceful Iraqi state in the region and against Turkey. Cox agreed to bring back the Sheikh and name him governor of southern Kurdistan. On December 20, 1922, Cox also agreed to a joint Anglo-Iraqi declaration that would allow a Kurdish government if they were able to form a constitution and agree on boundaries. Cox knew that with the instability in the region and the fact that there were many Kurdish groups it would be nearly impossible for them to come to a solution. Upon his return, Mahmud proceeded to pronounce himself King of the Kingdom of Kurdistan. The Sheikh rejected the deal with the British and began working in alliance with the Turks against the British. Cox realized the situation and in 1923 he denied the Kurds any say in the government and withdrew his offer of their own independent state. The Sheikh was the king until 1924 and was involved in uprisings against the British until 1932, when the Royal Air Force and British-trained Iraqis were able to capture the Sheikh again and exile him to southern Iraq. Death and legacy Sheikh sued for peace and was exiled in southern Iraq in May 1932 and was able to return to his family village in 1941 where he remained the rest of his years. He ultimately died in 1956 with his family. He is still remembered today with displays of him around Iraqi Kurdistan and especially in Sulaimaniah. He is a hero to the Kurdish people to this day, as he is thought of as a brave leader against the British Mandate in Iraq who fought for the independence and respect of his people. He is regarded as a pioneer for many future Kurd leaders.

Despite a longstanding prohibition by the Tibetan authorities on the entry of Europeans into Tibet, Strachey surveyed parts of western Tibet during the late 1840s. He was the second son of Edward Strachey, second son of Sir Henry Strachey, 1st Baronet. His brothers included Sir Richard Strachey, Sir John Strachey and Sir Edward Strachey, 3rd Baronet. Tibetan surveys In 1846, while a lieutenant of the 66th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry, Strachey surveyed the Tibetan regions surrounding Lakes Manasarovar and Rakshastal. He found a channel between the lakes, suggesting that Manasarovar, and not Rakshastal, was the source of the Sutlej River. Strachey's brother Richard, with J. E. Winterbottom, continued the exploration of the lakes in 1848. In 1847 Strachey was appointed to a boundary commission of Jammu and Kashmir led by Alexander Cunningham. The third member was Thomas Thomson. The commission was set up to fix the boundary between Tibet and Ladakh. Raja Gulab Singh's forces had previously annexed Ladakh and invaded Tibet in 1841. The British deemed it important to formalise the boundary so as to prevent any future conflicts. However, the Tibetan authorities did not participate. Neither was the commssion given permission to enter Tibet. The commission based itself at Leh, Ladakh. It eventually drafted a boundary and retired. In 1848 Strachey was the first European to find the Siachen Glacier, and ascended it for 2 miles. In 1849, Strachey and his brother Richard briefly entered Tibet by following the Niti Pass out of Garhwal. Their route included Tholing Monastery and Hanle. Strachey's Tibetan surveys won him the Royal Geographical Society's Patron's Medal in 1852. Family On 6 September 1859, by this time a captain of the 66th Goorkha Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry, he married Joanna Catherine, daughter of Rudolphe Cloete, of Newlands, Cape Town, South Africa. The wedding was in Claremont, Cape Town. Their only child was Julia Charlotte, who in 1884 married barrister William Chance (2 July 1853 ‚Äì 9 April 1935), son of James Timmins Chance of the glassmaking company Chance Brothers. Julia was an amateur sculptor, and a supporter of the Arts and Crafts movement. The couple's house, Orchards in Surrey, was designed by architect Edwin Lutyens. In 1902, Sir William Chance succeeded his father to the Chance baronetcy. Julia, Lady Chance died in 1949.

Other summer activities included dancing, ball games, and canoeing and steamboat excursions on Lake Ripley. The Minnesota Editorial Association, in a report at the time, called Brightwood \\"the most lovely spot in Minnesota\\" and a \\"gem of a lake with pebbly shores and blue as the vaults of heaven.\\" Thousands of people visited the resort, many of them wealthy individuals pictured in suits and fancy dresses, but the resort was not financially successful. In 1893, the resort was forced to close, a victim of the Panic of 1893 and competition from resorts to the north that became accessible by railroad. The octagonal cottage that was used as a steamboat waiting area and landing station remained on Lake Ripley. It was sold to Dr. Frank E. Bissell and later to Tipton Fester McClure in 1907. McClure was an investor in the Litchfield Glove Factory. The McClures rented it out after enclosing the south side with screens and making a kitchen and bedroom in the main part. Vern Sederstrom bought the house in 1950 and he sold it to Raynold and Myrtle Allen, whose son Richard was a close friend of my brother Mike.

Different Turtles made their debut live appearance on The Flash, portrayed by Aaron Douglas and Vanessa Walsh. Publication history The first Turtle appears in All Flash #21 and was created by Gardner Fox and Martin Naydel. The second Turtle appears in Showcase #4 and was created by Robert Kanigher and Carmine Infantino. Fictional character biography Turtle (Golden Age) The original Turtle is a 1940s villain who uses tricks of slowness in battle with the Golden Age Flash (Jay Garrick). His main weapon is slow, deliberate planning. After a few clashes with the Flash, the Turtle fades from the public scene.All-Flash #21 Years later, the Turtle Man carries on his legacy. After the debut of the third Flash (Wally West) in recent years, the original Turtle returns, now with the younger Turtle Man as his henchman, to take over Keystone City from underground. A final clash with Wally and his allies results in the Turtle destroying his own headquarters, and apparently himself with it.Showcase #4 Turtle Man (Silver Age) The Turtle Man (sometimes simply calling himself \\"the Turtle\\") is the first gimmicked Rogue fought by the second Flash (Barry Allen) and appears in Central City shortly after Barry's debut as the Flash. Originally using his natural slowness as a weapon, such as returning to rob a bank vault later to place people off guard, this Turtle Man is also an independently wealthy scientific genius who creates fantastic devices based on slowness. After robbing the bank he paints his shadow on the wall, fooling the Flash into crashing into it. In his first appearance he is captured by the Flash while trying to escape via boat and arrested. This is apparently true both Pre- and Post-Crisis. Turtle Man only has a handful of battles with the second Flash. After some years, the original Turtle from the 1940s returns and meets his \\"successor\\". Impressed with the latter's scientific talent, the first Turtle becomes an ally in an attempt to take over Keystone City. A lab accident seriously cripples the Turtle Man during this time. After the third Flash (Wally West) and his allies find the Turtle's underground headquarters, the original Turtle seemingly kills himself while the younger Turtle Man is taken into custody. Later, the Turtle Man reappears again, seemingly cured from his severe injuries, and having developed the ability to 'steal' speed, slowing down others around him to a crawl no matter how fast they were moving. During the Infinite Crisis, the Turtle Man is part of the Secret Society of Super Villains led by Alexander Luthor Jr. (posing as Lex Luthor), using his speed-stealing abilities to negate the power of speedsters and thus make it harder for the heroes to track the Society.Flash vol. 2 #219. DC Comics. Still Force entity In Scott Snyder's Justice League series, the Turtle is revised as believing in an opposing energy to the Speed Force, known as the \\"Still Force\\". Each time he accessed this power, it aged him. Now a hatchling (described as \\"The Fourth Generation of his line\\"), he is finally attuned to the Still Force, and grants Gorilla Grodd (now a member of Lex Luthor's Legion of Doom) total control of it to combat the Flash.Justice League vol. 2 #4 (July 2018) DC Comics. Jai West In the pages of \\"Flash Forward\\", Jai West is a manifestation of Wally West's fear of not being able to see his family again that was born in the Dark Multiverse. He is the twin brother of Iris West II and was emigrated to Earth 0 by Wally.Flash Forward #1-6. DC Comics. In the \\"Watchmen\\" sequel \\"Doomsday Clock\\", Doctor Manhattan's vision of a possible future says that Jai will become a superhero called Turtle.Doomsday Clock #12. DC Comics. Powers and abilities The Turtle Man wears a device that enables him to project a forcefield which can stop bullets. His shell is also a body armor which can expand to cover his head and also has some jets in them. The Turtle Man also has a ray device that he uses to make people move slower, as well as a laser gun that causes the optic nerves of a person to see everything moving faster than they are. Other characters named the Turtle There have been other villains who called themselves the Turtle: * The Turtle is a gangster who fought Robotman.Star-Spangled Comics #17. DC Comics. * The Turtle is a criminal who faced off against Green Arrow and Speedy. He is a channel pirate who operates out of a glass structure and uses a submarine and his gang to commit crimes.Adventure Comics #122. DC Comics. In other media * Turtle appears in the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"Flash and Substance\\". His statue makes a cameo in the Flash Museum. Turtle is also seen in the bar where Flash's Rogues Gallery hang out. *Two different Turtles appear in The Flash: ** The first Turtle appears in the 10th episode of the second season, portrayed by Aaron Douglas. This version is a metahuman thief named Russell Glosson who can drain the potential kinetic energy from his immediate surroundings and all those around him, sapping their speed. He is eventually apprehended by the Flash and imprisoned at S.T.A.R. Labs, where he is secretly killed by Harry Wells, who uses his brain tissue to create a device to siphon the Flash's speed. ** A female version of Turtle appears in the sixth season episode \\"Death of the Speed Force\\", portrayed by Vanessa Walsh. This version is Frida Novikov, a metahuman criminal with chronokinetic abilities which manifest as \\"time bubbles\\". While attempting to get revenge on everyone who ruined a previous crime spree she went on, she was confronted by Joe West, the Flash, and Kid Flash. Together, they distracted her long enough to negate her powers with Velocity-X formula and Turtle II is arrested by Joe.

A small, weak pup, he went on to become the most celebrated and successful dog of his time. Master McGrath was born in 1866 at Colligan Lodge, the home of James Galwey, a well-known trainer and owner of greyhounds. Master McGrath was one of a litter of seven pups and although small was powerfully built. As a pup, his pet name was \\"Dicksy\\". First trial The dog showed none of the outstanding qualities which were later to make him famous at his first trial; his performance was so bad that his trainer ordered him to be given away. As luck would have it his \\"slipper\\" (handler) took charge of him and having more faith in him, entered him in several courses which he won. After these wins, he was returned to his trainer. Waterloo Cup He won the Waterloo Cup on three occasions, 1868, 1869 and 1871, and was the first greyhound to do so. He became such a celebrity that his owner, The 2nd Baron Lurgan, was asked to take him to be seen by Queen Victoria and the British Royal Family. His success enabled Lord Lurgan to build a terrace of houses in Walthamstow from Master McGrath's winnings. These houses now form part of Shernhall Street, but are still clearly marked at one end of the terrace as \\"Master McGrath Terrace\\". The plaque commemorating Master McGrath can be found in the upper part of number 33 Shernhall Street. Death Master McGrath died early in 1873 of heart disease which had already ended his career as a sire. An autopsy showed that his heart was twice the size of a normal dog's heart. He was buried in the grounds of a house called \\"Solitude\\" in Lurgan. The house has since been demolished for development and Master McGrath's grave lies at a house once owned by an early English settler.

Edmond Mart√®ne: De antiquis ecclesiae ritibus, Rouen 1700 In 1672 he entered the Benedictine Abbey of St-R√©my at Reims, a house of the Congregation of Saint-Maur. Owing to his zeal for learning, however, he was sent to Saint-Germain to receive training under d'Ach√©ry and Mabillon, and also to assist in the preliminary work connected with the new edition of the Church Fathers. Thenceforth he devoted his life to the study of subjects connected with history and liturgy, residing in various monasteries of his order, especially at Rouen, where he received the sympathetic co-operation of the prior of Sainte-Marthe. Even in his student years he had gathered from widely various sources everything that might be helpful in elucidating the Rule of St. Benedict; the fruit of his labours he published in 1690 as Commentarius in regulam S. P. Benedicti litteralis, moralis, historicus ex variis antiquorum scriptorum commentationibus, actis sanctorum, monasticis ritibus aliisque monumentis cum editis tum manuscriptis concinnatus (Paris, 1690; 1695). During the same year he issued as a supplement to this: De antiquis monachorum ritibus libri 5 collecti ex variis ordinariis, consuetudinariis ritualibusque manuscriptis (Lyons, 1690; Venice, 1765). These were followed by other liturgical works. In 1708 Mart√®ne and his fellow Benedictine, Ursin Durand, were commissioned to ransack the archives of France and Belgium for materials for the forthcoming revised edition of the Gallia Christiana, proposed by the prior of Sainte-Marthe. The numerous documents gathered by them from about eight hundred abbeys and one hundred cathedrals were incorporated in the abovementioned work or in the five volumes of the Thesaurus novus anecdotorum (Paris, 1717). The results of a journey made through the Netherlands and Germany for the purpose of documentary research were embodied by the two scholars in the nine folio volumes of Veterum scriptorum et monumentorum ecclesiasticorum et dogmaticorum amplissima collectio.(Paris, 1724‚Äì33). Finally, the sixth volume of the Annales Ordinis S. Benedicti (Paris, 1739) is the work of Mart√®ne alone.

It was caused by the death of the sitting Member of Parliament for the constituency, Bob McTaggart. The Scottish National Party (SNP) had high hopes of repeating their victory from the previous year at the by-election for the Glasgow Govan seat, and they chose as their candidate a close associate of their Govan victor, Jim Sillars in Alex Neil. However, the hoped for victory did not transpire for the SNP, as Mike Watson retained the seat for the Labour Party with a 6,462 majority, despite a 20.3% rise in the SNP share of the votes cast. The day after the election, The Glasgow Herald described the result as \\"the revenge\\" Labour sought for their by-election defeat in Govan a few months earlier. The SNP blamed opinion polls in the latter stages of the election campaign which showed them trailing Labour, arguing these stalled their momentum. Winner Mike Watson argued that the result showed that \\"The SNP bandwagon is off the rails\\", although SNP spokesman Chris McLean denied that the result was a setback, pointing out that they had significantly increased their vote share. The Liberal Democrats fell to fifth place, the worst position achieved by a major party in any British by-election since the 1976 Walsall North by-election. This was equaled in the Henley by-election in 2008, when Labour also fell to fifth, and surpassed in the Glasgow North East by-election in 2009, when the Liberal Democrats came sixth. Their 1.6% vote share remained the lowest percentage vote for the Liberal Democrats until they entered the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition in 2010, and in fact was not beaten until the South Shields by- election three years into their time in government. This was also the only parliamentary contest engaged in by the Scottish Socialist Party that existed at the time (which should not be confused with the present day Scottish Socialist Party).

Lobola and the Law In South Africa, where the custom of lobola is widely practiced, the union was previously concluded in terms of customary law, but is now governed under the Recognition of Customary Marriages, 1998 (Act 120 of 1998) (RCMA) and has the following prerequisites to qualify a marriage under customary law: * Consensus - Historically, consensus was sought between the families of the prospective bride and groom‚Äôs families. Since 2008, the RCMA states that consensus is required only between the individuals, and not their families. * Age Requirements - According to customary law, no specific age requirement exists; however, the RCMA includes a minimum age requirement of 18. * Lobola - A customary marriage, under the RCMA, is valid on the agreement to pay lobolo and does not require the payment of lobolo. * Transfer of the Bride - The transfer of a bride is another requirement for the validity of a customary marriage. The RCMA does not specifically regulate this custom and is dealt with on an ad-hoc basis. * Absence of Common Law Marriage - Two parties in a monogamous customary marriage can enter into a common law marriage, but not vice versa * Prohibited Degrees of Relationship - In the past, each community had their own rules about prohibited relationships. These rules have evolved over the years. The RCMA states that these prohibited relationships are regulated by customary rules. South African law recognises customary marriages through the Recognition of Customary Marriages, 1998 (Act 120 of 1998) . The purpose of the Act was to address gender inequality and the diminished rights of women in customary marriages. The Act was passed in order to improve the position of such women by using measures which brought customary law in line with the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, as well as South Africa‚Äôs international human rights commitments. A key requirements for a customary marriage to be recognised as a valid marriage is that the marriage must be negotiated, entered into or celebrated in accordance with customary law. Furthermore, the prospective spouses must be of the age of 18 years, and both prospective spouses must consent to the marriage. Until the recent Johannesburg High Court judgement in Sengadi v Tsambo 3 November 2018 , there has been contention and confusion as to what constitutes a valid customary marriage. In the case involving the widow of renowned hip hop musician Jabulani Tsambo, also known as HHP, her status as the legally recognised customary wife was primarily what was in question. Here the family of the deceased refused to acknowledge Lerato Sengadi as the customary wife on the basis that there had not been a customary ‚Äòhandover ceremony‚Äô of the bride to the family of the groom, which would meet the requirements of a ‚Äò‚Äôcelebration‚Äô‚Äô in accordance with customary law, and therefore no customary law marriage was concluded or came into existence between the deceased and Sengadi. On examination of the evidence, the Judge concluded that in fact, there had been a tacit waiver of this custom because a ‚Äò‚Äôsymbolic‚Äô‚Äô handing over of the applicant to the Tsambo family occurred after the conclusion of the customary law marriage. As the Judge put it: Sengadi. v. Tsambo, at para.20 [2018] In what can be described as a landmark case, the Judge ruled against the family and declared Sengadi as the lawful spouse of the deceased. Negotiations In South African law, certain requirements must be complied with in order to conclude a valid customary marriage, including the negotiation of the Lobolo. This negotiation is a crucial step towards a valid customary marriage, in law and in culture. A distinction is made between ‚ÄòLobolo‚Äô or ‚ÄòLobola‚Äô, the tangible form of asset that constitutes an agreed upon dowry, and the Lobola negotiations, the set of legal customary processes that constitutes the fundamental dialogues between the two families and is necessary to establish the Lobolo and the conclusion of the negotiation. The latter always precedes the former. The process of Lobolo negotiations can be culturally varied, long and complex, and involves many members from both the bride and the groom's extended families; normally, this would just be the uncles of the marrying parties, as well as the fathers, where custom allows. The groom is not allowed to participate directly in the actual negotiations. In some cultures women may be present in the negotiations, while some households hold on to a tradition of not allowing women to actively take part in the negotiations. Ivulamlomo is a key process to the negotiation as negotiations cannot begin until this traditional act has been observed. Often, to dispel any tensions between the families, in modern times a bottle of brandy is placed on the table; however, this is not required nor is the vulamlomo limited to brandy, and it can be traditional sorghum beer or cash. This is usually not drunk; it is simply a gesture to welcome the guest family and make everyone feel more relaxed, and it is known as ivulamlomo, which, literally translated, is isiXhosa for mouth opener (Sotho pulamolomo) i.e. price for opening your mouth (to speak) to express the purpose of your visit. It is up to the potential wife‚Äôs delegation to decide as to whether to make use of the alcohol or keep it closed. Lobola cannot be paid in full in one go, the groom's delegation will need to come again after the first negotiations to finish paying for their bride to be. Once the Lobola has been paid in full then the next step follows which is called Izibizo, which can happen on the day when lobola negotiations are concluded. This step involves the groom's delegation giving the bride's family according to the list that was issued presents, which may include blankets, pinafores, doeks, shawls and three foot pots or grass mats for women and coat, walking stick, hat, beer pots for men. There is then a celebration to mark the occasion. Amount It is generally accepted that cows, at a minimum, are required in a lobolo within the Xhosa and Zulu cultures. While differing customs within various regions may contribute in determining an amount of the cash value of each cow, it also depends on the negotiation prowess of the representatives, or oonozakuzaku. In modern times, there has been growing controversy around the amount demanded in certain families deemed by spectators as unreasonably excessive. name=\\"Daily Dispatch\\"> Today, negotiations involve setting a price for a single cow and then multiplying the agreed price by the number of cows the new bride is deemed to be worth. The amount due is affected by many different factors including, but not limited to, the education level of the prospective bride, the financial means of the prospective spouses, and whether the prospective bride (or groom) already has children. Semanya (2014) claims that even high- profile figures such as Nelson Mandela practiced the custom, by paying a lobolo of 60 cows for his wife, Gra√ßa Machel. Shona culture and Ndebele culture A man marrying a woman from the Shona or Ndebele culture has to observe lobolo (called roora in Shona). A man is seen to love his partner when he strives to save and pay for lobolo. In the Shona and Ndebele cultures in Zimbabwe, Lobolo takes place in a number of stages. At each stage of the ceremony, there are traditions to observe and small amounts to pay. Lobolo is not paid at once, but is a culmination of many different amounts. The amount paid is determined during negotiations and is dependent on various factors. If the groom has been saving up in preparation for the marriage, after hints from his beloved of what the lobolo might be, the process can be concluded in two short stages - the first stage, the mouth opener stage or \\"isivulamlomo\\", where the groom is given a chance to state his intentions to marry his beloved after putting money in a woven basket, and the bride's family tells the grooms family what they want as lobolo. A date is then set, agreeable to both parties, to meet again. At the time of writing, a cow in Zimbabwe costs $500 and the bride's family can ask for a cash equivalent of the number of cows they want. This is convenient to most families because keeping cattle can be time and labor intensive. The second stage, where the groom's family present themselves on the agreed date, money is again placed in a woven basket to be allowed to speak and fulfills the bride's family requests by presenting all of the lobolo.~~~~ The price and ceremony for meeting the in-laws is called \\"Mbonano\\" and is entry to the house. This is followed by \\"Guzvi\\", a second price for greeting the in-laws and accompanied by the traditional greeting (special clapping depending on culture, noting that the Shona people are 12 different ethnic groups). Subsequent gifts of cash or food are then placed into a special plate that is used for the occasion. This is either bought or borrowed and has a price and ceremonial reference as well: \\"Kubvisa ndiro\\" (the price of buying or borrowing the plate). Other gifts or prices include \\"Vhuramuromo\\" (meaning opening of mouth) for the greeting of the guests, similar to the Xhosa Loloba mvulamlomo. \\"Dare\\" for calling of the witnesses to the marriage and \\"Matsvakirai kuno\\" for the explanation of \\"How did you meet my daughter\\" or \\"Who told you that I have a daughter?\\" Gifts for the mother of the bride then include \\"Mbereko\\", for carrying the bride in a pouch or sling when she was a baby, and \\"Mafukidzadumbu\\" for \\"covering of the belly\\"; this is alternately translated as \\"carrying the baby in the womb\\" or \\"tucking the baby in with a blanket (when she wakes in the night)\\". Among the various stages of the lobolo ceremony, the groom-to-be has to provide outfits for the mother of the bride. These are called \\"Nhumbi dzaamai\\" and will traditionally include a blanket alongside a standard outfit, while the outfits for the father are called \\"Nhumbi dzababa\\" and will often be a suit of choice to later wear for the European wedding ceremony (if the couple has one). A special gift for the father of the bride is the \\"Matekenyandebvu\\", to acknowledge him for \\"the scratching and pulling of the beard\\" as she sat on his lap, or putting up with the playful antics of his daughter as a child. This is followed by a small allowance for \\"Mari inouhongwa nemusihare\\" (the purchase of household or cooking utensils), and this amount is given to the bride. If there are younger sisters or siblings, she may give them a portion of the money. This money is for all the cooking that will have taken place for the party which the groom will finance after the ceremony is concluded. Next comes the actual \\"bride price\\". This is called \\"Rusambo\\" and although the process described above is referred to or called \\"roora\\", this is the name given to the whole ceremony and all of the gifts, not just the bride price or dowry. Traditionally a gift of cattle, this is most commonly paid in cash, although the amounts will still be representative of fair market price for cattle. The new groom will also pay for \\"Munongedzi wedanga\\", a stick used for driving the cattle into the corral. If the cattle are cash equivalents, the stick will also be its cash equivalent. Normally this is given in the form of a walking stick. Grocery items and outfits are at the discretion of the bride's parents, and will be included and inspected after the Rusambo. Adhering to the stated requirements of the new in-laws is a show of respect from the new son-in-law. It is often advisable to do exactly as stated or better, to ensure smooth relations between the newly united families. The final stage includes a party financed by the newly acquired groom. After the gifts are presented, the groom greets the in-laws as a new groom (no longer a prospective groom or stranger, but a member of the family) with the special traditional clapping greeting and is permitted to be a part of the household. In some traditional circumstances, the younger siblings of the new bride may also see the groom as an alternate husband and he may be responsible for their welfare. In the past, the younger sisters could also be offered as alternate wives in the case of death of the bride (older daughter), in similar fashion to ancient (Mosaic) Jewish tradition. This tradition has fast fallen away due to urbanisation, migration and HIV/AIDS (no source provided). Once welcomed to the family, the groom may be given an animal totem depending on the ethnic group he marries into. He would be given a respectful title such as 'MUKWASHA' which means son-in-law. Other titles could be 'babamukuru' or 'babamunini' depending on the relationships in the family (if he marries an older sister, he becomes \\"babamukuru\\" to the younger siblings and if he is married to a younger sister, he is \\"babamunini\\" to those sisters who are older than his wife). In certain Shona groups, even after the main ceremony, lobolo still needs to be paid in small amounts after the birth of a child or after 20 years, this is to continually thank and acknowledge the wife's family. Negative effects Lobolo may have some unintended negative effects. It may create a financial barrier for some young men looking to take a bride. It is common for a couple that is emotionally ready to commit to each other to stay unmarried if the man does not have the financial resources to satisfy the impeding traditional ritual, and in some cases the bride-to-be who has the financial resources secretly pays her own Lobolo by giving the money to the man who in turn hands it over to the brides family. For those who do have the financial means, the issue can be Lobolo's opportunity cost. Young men who are in the wealth- creation stage of life may feel that their future is better secured if they invest their money elsewhere to receive significant financial returns. Lobolo is seen by some as an extravagance that has little relevance in a society where young Africans are trying to lift themselves out of poverty. However, the tradition is still adhered to as strongly as ever, and in families where tradition and intention override greed, Lobolo can be a great way of showing commitment between families, not just between the bride and groom. Lobolo is also seen by some rural South African woman as a sign of respect in that it symbolises their worth and reinforces their dignity. Many traditional marriages utilise a cash-based Lobolo; this can be then followed by a European-style wedding ceremony, where the Lobolo funds are used to pay for expenses. In this way, any outlaid costs are returned to the payer in another form, preserving tradition, honour and finances. Recently, the meaning of lobolo has been abused. The bride's families are demanding huge amounts of money from the groom's family and in turn, lobolo is now more of a money- generating-scheme from most families. Instead of simple gifts for lobolo payment-as it was in the 20th century and beyond, fathers are demanding outrageous amounts for their daughters. This has given some men in the African society the 'right' to abuse and ill-treat their wives because they feel that they bought them. There is no gender equality because (in some views) the system \\"promotes male superiority\\" where the voices of women do not matter nor their importance acknowledged. Usually African men are keen to marry their girlfriends, however there are hindrances which may prevent this. As mentioned in the above paragraph finance is the main one. Other potential hindrances are family members not approving their future son-in-law, a bitter past where the parents dig out dirt. It is important that a couple communicates these issues openly with each other so that they can protect their other half should anything occur Dissolution The dissolution of a customary marriage occurs on the death of the husband or wife. However, the marriage could continue if the woman is transferred to a brother of the deceased to sire an heir. In the event that the woman returns to her father‚Äôs house as a result of alleged abuse, the husband may have to pay a fine to the father, prior to fetching (phutuma) her. If the husband does not fetch her within reasonable time, then it would be assumed that he had intended to dissolve the marriage. If the wife refuses to return to the husband, then the husband may make a claim to a portion of the lobola. If the husband wishes to end the marriage, he could send her back to her father‚Äôs house. Should the wife initiate the divorce, the father will have to repay some of the lobola.

The gap is between Mount Nicholson and Jardine's Lookout behind Wong Nai Chung (Happy Valley). Five roads meet at the Gap: Wong Nai Chung Gap Road, Tai Tam Reservoir Road, Repulse Bay Road, Deep Water Bay Road and Black's Link. It is a strategic passage between the north and south of the island, though less so today since the opening of the Aberdeen Tunnel. History In the 1930s, the British army began installing defence structures at the gap as a strategically important location, being the primary passage between the North and South of Hong Kong Island. Defensive structures included bunkers along Wong Nai Chung Gap Road, along with fortifications on Jardine's Lookout, near the end of Sir Cecil's Ride. Battle of Hong Kong The Battle of Wong Nai Chung Gap was the largest sustainment of casualties in a single day, on both sides, in the whole conflict. Its subsequent capture by the Japanese effectively led to the downfall of Hong Kong Island, splitting the forces there in two (Separating East/West Brigades). At the time of this Battle, the Wong Nai Chung Gap area included defenders of the Middlesex Regiment, The Winnipeg Grenadiers and the HKVDC. Canadian Army Brigadier John K. Lawson was present at the HQ and involved in the Battle. On 18 December, the Japanese had landed around present day Taikoo and had made advances into the North Point area. They moved up towards Wong Nai Chung Gap from Braemar Hill through the primary use of Sir Cecil's Ride, but also through Wan Chai and Happy Valley. Primary engagements occurred around the area of Jardine's Catch-water, where there were two pillboxes manned mainly by Middlesex Machine Gunners (JLO1/2). Royal Scots on Mount Nicholson also became engaged in fighting the Japanese advance units on the adjacent Jardine's Lookout, but also those coming up Happy Valley/Wan Chai area. The superior Japanese force soon closed in on the West Brigade HQ, before the staff and other units could be evacuated. The conflict ensued for a long period, with defenders holding out and inflicting heavy casualties through the use of heavy machine gun fire. The defenders were surrounded and pinned down, with few units able to get through to relieve them. The defense finally deteriorated after nearly every defender was either killed or wounded. Even Brigadier Lawson made a call to Fortress HQ, saying he was going outside to ‚Äòfight it out‚Äô and was killed in action. Few stragglers managed to escape and the remainder of the soldiers (almost all wounded) were taken prisoner. The Japanese held the position against a number of counterattacks, and were able to effectively split the Commonwealth forces in Hong Kong Island. This was key factor that led to the downfall of the colony on 25 December Surrender.

He served as the 16th Governor of Idaho mayor of Idaho Falls, and was a member of the Idaho Democratic Party.http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/clark1.html Early years Clark was born in Hadley, Indiana, the son of Eunice (Hadley) and Joseph Addison Clark.http://politicalgraveyard.com/families/11365.html Clark made the journey to eastern Idaho by narrow-gauge railroad in 1885 with his family to Eagle Rock (now He attended Rose Polytechnic Institute in Terre Haute, Indiana, but cut short his education due to a lung injury during track and field practice. He returned to Idaho and engaged in farming, mining, and cattle raising. On October 26, 1905, he married Ethel Salome Peck, and they had four children. Career Clark became a licensed engineer in 1905 and worked as a civil engineer. His reservoir on the Blackfoot River was purchased by the government and his plan for impounding Lost River was merged into Mackay Dam. After two terms as councilman, he served as mayor of Idaho Falls from 1913 to 1915 and again from 1926 to 1936. During this term, the city built the Municipal Hydroelectric Plant No. 1. Clark's interest turned to Idaho mines until he was again elected mayor of Idaho Falls in 1927 and served in that office until his inauguration as governor on January 4, 1937. During his two-year term, a state tuberculosis hospital was authorized, a judicious pardon and parole system was installed, and junior college districts were installed. Clark lost the Democratic primary for a second term to his predecessor, C. Ben Ross, who ran for U.S. Senator in 1936 against longtime incumbent William Borah, but lost. Ross lost the general election in 1938 to C. A. Bottolfsen; Clark left office on January 2, 1939, and returned to Idaho Falls and his private interests. He chose not to run in 1940 to reclaim the office, which was won by his younger brother Chase Clark (1883‚Äì1966). Chase was the father-in-law of Frank Church (1924‚Äì84), a four-term U.S. Senator (1957‚Äì81) and presidential candidate in 1976. In turn, Bottolfsen defeated Chase in 1942. Death Clark died of complications of lung cancer at age 62 in Idaho Falls he is interred at Rose Hill Cemetery in Idaho Falls.

This protocol allows an SD-SDI receiver to verify that each field of video is received correctly. The SD-SDI transmitter calculates two CRC values for each video field‚Äîone corresponding to the active picture, and corresponding to the entire field (excluding the switching lines)--and places them in an EDH ancillary data packet. The EDH packet is inserted at a specific location in each field of video. The SD-SDI receiver also generates the same two CRC values for each field and compares them against the CRC values in the received EDH packet to determine if each field of video is received without errors. The EDH packet also contains bits to signal that a prior link in a broadcast or transmission chain contained an error; equipment which receives a video signal with an incorrect CRC, and retransmits the signal, is expected to re-insert the correct CRC (which may be different if the equipment alters the video signal in any way) and set the flag indicating a prior error. This feature makes it easier to determine which link, in a multi-link chain, was the source of the error. The EDH protocol does not provide for error correction, only error detection. Also, there is no mechanism in SD-SDI to allow a field containing errors to be retransmitted. EDH is used primarily to assist in identifying faulty equipment in a video chain so that it can be quickly replaced or repaired. EDH is not used with high definition video, as the HD serial digital interface includes a mandatory embedded CRC for each line.

For instance, the binary Champernowne sequence :0\\\\ 1\\\\ 00\\\\ 01\\\\ 10\\\\ 11\\\\ 000\\\\ 001 \\\\ldots formed by concatenating all binary strings in shortlex order, clearly contains all the binary strings and so is disjunctive. (The spaces above are not significant and are present solely to make clear the boundaries between strings). The complexity function of a disjunctive sequence S over an alphabet of size k is pS(n) = kn.Bugeaud (2012) p.91 Any normal sequence (a sequence in which each string of equal length appears with equal frequency) is disjunctive, but the converse is not true. For example, letting 0n denote the string of length n consisting of all 0s, consider the sequence :0\\\\ 0^1\\\\ 1\\\\ 0^2\\\\ 00\\\\ 0^4\\\\ 01\\\\ 0^8\\\\ 10\\\\ 0^{16}\\\\ 11\\\\ 0^{32}\\\\ 000\\\\ 0^{64}\\\\ldots obtained by splicing exponentially long strings of 0s into the shortlex ordering of all binary strings. Most of this sequence consists of long runs of 0s, and so it is not normal, but it is still disjunctive. A disjunctive sequence is recurrent but never uniformly recurrent/almost periodic. Examples The following result can be used to generate a variety of disjunctive sequences: :If a1, a2, a3, ..., is a strictly increasing infinite sequence of positive integers such that n ‚Üí ‚àû (an+1 / an) = 1, :then for any positive integer m and any integer base b ‚â• 2, there is an an whose expression in base b starts with the expression of m in base b. :(Consequently, the infinite sequence obtained by concatenating the base-b expressions for a1, a2, a3, ..., is disjunctive over the alphabet {0, 1, ..., b-1}.) Two simple cases illustrate this result: * an = nk, where k is a fixed positive integer. (In this case, n ‚Üí ‚àû (an+1 / an) = n ‚Üí ‚àû ( (n+1)k / nk ) = n ‚Üí ‚àû (1 + 1/n)k = 1.) : E.g., using base-ten expressions, the sequences :: 123456789101112... (k = 1, positive natural numbers), :: 1491625364964... (k = 2, squares), :: 182764125216343... (k = 3, cubes), :: etc., :are disjunctive on {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. * an = pn, where pn is the nth prime number. (In this case, n ‚Üí ‚àû (an+1 / an) = 1 is a consequence of pn ~ n ln n.) : E.g., the sequences :: 23571113171923... (using base ten), :: 10111011111011110110001 ... (using base two), :: etc., are disjunctive on the respective digit sets. Another result that provides a variety of disjunctive sequences is as follows: :If an = (f(n)), where f is any non-constant polynomial with real coefficients such that f(x) > 0 for all x > 0, :then the concatenation a1a2a3... (with the an expressed in base b) is a normal sequence in base b, and is therefore disjunctive on {0, 1, ..., b-1}. E.g., using base-ten expressions, the sequences :: 818429218031851879211521610... (with f(x) = 2x3 \\\\- 5x2 \\\\+ 11x ) :: 591215182124273034... (with f(x) = œÄx + e) are disjunctive on {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. Rich numbers A rich number or disjunctive number is a real number whose expansion with respect to some base b is a disjunctive sequence over the alphabet {0,...,b‚àí1}. Every normal number in base b is disjunctive but not conversely. The real number x is rich in base b if and only if the set { x bn mod 1} is dense in the unit interval.Bugeaud (2012) p.92 A number that is disjunctive to every base is called absolutely disjunctive or is said to be a lexicon. Every string in every alphabet occurs within a lexicon. A set is called \\"comeager\\" or \\"residual\\" if it contains the intersection of a countable family of open dense sets. The set of absolutely disjunctive reals is residual.Calude & Zamfirescu (1999) It is conjectured that every real irrational algebraic number is absolutely disjunctive.Adamczewski & Bugeaud (2010) p.414 Notes References * * * Category:Sequences and series ","title":"Disjunctive sequence"},{"id":"4251968","text":"In mathematics, the term normal sequence has multiple meanings, depending on the area of specialty.

The convention determines which law should be used, but does not harmonise the substance (the actual law). It was signed in Rome, Italy on 19 June 1980 and entered into force in 1991. It has now been replaced by the Rome I Regulation (593/2008)593/2008 except for in Denmark, which has an opt- out from implementing regulations under the area of freedom, security and justice, and the Overseas countries and territories of European Union member states. In that respect, the convention is applicable in Aruba, the Caribbean Netherlands, Cura√ßao, Sint Maarten (Kingdom of the Netherlands), Faroer (Denmark), Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, Saint Barth√©lemy, French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna and New Caledonia (France). for France, see Article 27 Scope of the convention Under Article 1, the Convention's rules are to apply to all choice of law issues involving contractual obligations and, under Article 10, once selected, the lex causae will govern: :(a) interpretation; :(b) performance but, in relation to the manner of performance and the steps to be taken in the event of defective performance, regard shall be had to the lex loci solutionis, i.e. law of the place in which performance takes place; :(c) within the limits of the powers conferred on the forum court by its procedural law, the consequences of breach, including the assessment of damages in so far as it is governed by rules of law; :(d) the various ways of extinguishing obligations, and the limitation of actions; and :(e) the consequences of nullity of the contract. Article 15 excludes the operation of renvoi. In addition, a number of issues with a separate characterisation are excluded, namely: *the status or capacity of natural persons. Article 11 covers the situation where two persons physically present in the same state make a contract, and both parties have capacity under the lex loci contractus. One party cannot invoke incapacity under another law unless the other party was aware of this incapacity at the time the contract was made or was not aware of the incapacity as a result of negligence. *contractual obligations relating to succession and all rights claimed in property in a marriage or family relationship, particularly where the question of the entitlement of any child who is illegitimate is raised. *obligations arising under negotiable instruments including bills of exchange, cheques, and promissory notes and connected to their negotiable character; *arbitration agreements and agreements on the choice of court (see arbitration clauses and forum selection clauses); *questions governed by the law of companies and other bodies corporate or unincorporate such as the creation, by registration or otherwise, legal capacity, internal organisation or winding up of companies and other bodies corporate or unincorporate, and the personal liability of officers and members for the obligations of the company or body; *the question whether an agent is able to bind a principal, or an organ to bind a company or body corporate or unincorporate, to a third party; *the constitution of trusts and the relationship between settlors, trustees and beneficiaries (see trusts (conflict)); *evidence and procedure save that, under Article 14, the Applicable Law applies to the extent that it contains, in the law of contract, rules which raise presumptions of law or determine the burden of proof. Thus, under Article 14 (2) a contract or an act intended to have legal effect may be proved by any mode of proof recognised by the lex fori or by any of the laws referred to in Article 9 under which that contract or act is formally valid, provided that such mode of proof can be administered by the forum court. *the question of whether a contracts of insurance covers a risk situated in the territories of one of the Member States is determined under the municipal law of the relevant states. This exclusion does not apply to contracts of reinsurance. The uniform rules Express selection Article 3 states the general rule that the parties to a contract have freedom of choice over the applicable law. To exercise this choice either express words may be used or the intention should be demonstrated with reasonable certainty by the terms of the contract or the circumstances of the case. The law chosen may apply to the whole or only a part of the contract, and the choice is not irrevocable. The parties can at any time agree to change the applicable law and any such variation will not prejudice the formal validity of the agreement nor adversely affect the rights of third parties. Where all the elements of a contract, at the time of its conclusion, are connected with only one country, Article 3 may not be used to evade the mandatory provisions of that state (Article 3(4)). To establish a choice demonstrated with reasonable certainty, there must have been a \\"real choice\\". That the parties would have chosen a particular law is not sufficient.\\"This Article does not permit the court to infer a choice of law that the parties might have made where they had no clear intention of making such a choice\\" (Giuliano-Lagarde Report). The court will take into account both the terms of the contract and the circumstances of the case.See the examples in the Guiliano-Lagarde Report. The Guiliano-Lagarde Report gives three examples of situations where a real choice may be demonstrated with reasonable certainty: * Standard form contracts The report gives as an example a Lloyd's policy of marine insurance. * Jurisdiction and arbitration agreements * Course of dealingSee further Implied selection If there is no express choice, Article 4 provides that the contract shall be governed by the law of the country with which it is most closely connected. If the agreement is severable, two applicable laws may be selected. For these purposes, it is presumed that the contract is most closely connected with the lex loci solutionis, i.e. the law of the place where the contract is to be performed, or the law of the habitual residence of the person who is to perform, or, in the case of a body corporate or unincorporate, where its central administration is located. However, if it is a commercial or professional contract, the applicable law will be the law of the place in which the principal place of business is situated or, where under the terms of the contract the performance is to be effected through a place of business other than the principal place of business, the country in which that other place of business is situated except that there is a rebuttable presumption: :where the subject matter of the agreement is immovable property, the lex situs will apply; and :contracts for the carriage of goods and charter-parties are governed by the law of the place in which, at the time the contract is concluded, the carrier has his principal place of business if that is also the place in which loading or discharge is to occur or the place where the consignor has his or her principal place of business. Consumer contracts Article 5 applies to contracts for the supply of goods or services to a consumer for a non-commercial purpose, or to a contract for the provision of credit for that object. Although Article 3 gives the parties a free choice of law, this choice cannot deprive the consumer of any protections available under the mandatory law of the country in which he has his habitual residence if the consumer was responding to advertising material or a specific invitation and makes the agreement in that country, or if the other party or his agent received the consumer's order in that country, or if the contract is for the sale of goods and the consumer travelled from that country to another country and there gave his order, provided that the consumer's journey was arranged by the seller for the purpose of inducing the consumer to buy. For these purposes, Article 7 defines \\"mandatory rules\\" as rules that must be applied whatever the Applicable Law. In deciding whether rules are mandatory in the lex fori or a law with which the contract has a close connection, regard shall be had to their nature and purpose and to the consequences of their application or non-application. If the contract is silent on the choice of law, it will be governed by the law of habitual residence if it is entered into in the circumstances described above. But this Article does not apply to: :(a) a contract of carriage; :(b) a contract for the supply of services where the services are to be supplied to the consumer exclusively in a country other than that in which he has his habitual residence. The Article does, however, apply to a contract which, for an inclusive price, provides for a combination of travel and accommodation. Contracts of employment Under Article 6, no choice of law selection contained in a contract of employment can deprive the employee of the protection afforded to him by the mandatory laws which would be applicable in the absence of that choice. If there is no express selection, an employment contract is governed, The provisions may only apply for the benefit of the employee. Material validity Under Article 8, the material validity of a contract, or of any term in a contract, shall be determined by the law which would govern it under the Convention if the contract or term were valid (i.e. the putative Applicable Law). But, if this would produce an obviously unfair result, a party may rely upon the law of the place of habitual residence to establish that he did not give a free consent. Formal validity Under Article 9, a contract concluded between persons who are in the same country is formally valid if it satisfies the formal requirements of either the Applicable Law or the law of the country where it is concluded. A contract concluded between persons who are in different countries is formally valid if it satisfies the formal requirements of either the Applicable Law or the law of one of those countries. Where a contract is concluded by an agent, the country in which the agent acts is the relevant country for the purposes of the earlier tests. But a contract relating to immovable property is always subject to the mandatory provisions of the lex situs. Transfers of obligation Article 12 deals with a voluntary assignment or novation. Whether the rights and/or obligations can be transferred, the nature of the relationship between the assignee and the debtor that results from a transfer, the conditions under which the assignment can be invoked against the debtor, and any question whether the debtor's obligations have been discharged, are determined by the Applicable Law of the original agreement. The Applicable Law of the transfer will determine the mutual obligations of assignor and assignee as against the third party, i.e. \\"the debtor\\". Article 13 deals with subrogation so that whether a third person may enforce an existing liability owed to a \\"creditor\\" by a \\"debtor\\" is determined by reference to the law which governs the debtor's duty to satisfy the creditor. Ordre public Under Article 16, the forum court may invoke its own public policy as a justification for refusing to apply the lex causae. Composite or federated states Under Article 19, where the choice of law rules point to a country with more than one legal system, the Convention selects the most appropriate municipal law (not the choice of law rules of that law given that renvoi is excluded). Signature, ratification and amendment The convention was signed by Belgium, Germany, France, Ireland and Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands on 19 June 1980, followed by Denmark and the United Kingdom in 1981, thus covering all members of the European Communities. It entered into force in 1991 for 8 of those countries and one year later for Ireland. During the enlargement of the Communities with Greece (1984), Spain and Portugal (1992) and Sweden, Finland and Austria (1996), and the 10 countries in 2004, treaties were concluded on the extension of the convention to those countries. Those Extension conventions were however not all ratified by the United Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland and thus which hampered entry into force of the convention between those three countries and the acceding countries.

Tiki bars are aesthetically defined by their tiki culture d√©cor which is based upon a romanticized conception of tropical cultures, most commonly Polynesian. Some bars also incorporate general nautical themes or retro elements from the early atomic age. Many early tiki bars were attached to hotels or were the bar sections for large Asian restaurants. While some are free-standing, cocktail- only affairs, many still serve food; and some hotel-related tiki establishments are still in existence. Large tiki bars may also incorporate a stage for live entertainment. Musicians such as Alfred Apaka and Don Ho played a historically important role in their popularity, and also book acts with other exotica-style bands and Polynesian dance floor shows.  History   Don the Beachcomber  Don the Beachcomber restaurant menu cover One of the earliest and perhaps the first of what is now known as a tiki bar was named \\"Don the Beachcomber\\", created in Hollywood in 1933 by Ernest Gantt (who later legally changed his name to \\"Donn Beach\\"). The bar served a wide variety of exotic rum drinks (including the Sumatra Kula and Zombie cocktail), and later Cantonese food. It displayed many artifacts that he had collected on earlier trips through the tropics. When Beach was sent to World War II, Don the Beachcomber flourished under his ex-wife's management (Sunny Sund), expanding into a chain of 16 restaurants. Ultimately there were at least 25 restaurants in the chain. When Gantt returned from the War, he moved to Hawaii and opened Waikiki Beach, one of two archetypal tiki bars. The bar was designed to evoke the South Pacific, with palm trees, tiki masks on the walls, a garden hose that showered a gentle rain on the roof and a myna bird that was trained to shout \\"Give me a beer, stupid!\\" The bar was located on the beach, lit by tiki torches outside which enhanced its primitive ambiance. A Don the Beachcomber was located at Waikiki's International Market Place. Trader Vic's Trader Vic's (London) The other archetypal bar is Trader Vic's, the first of which was created by Victor Bergeron in Oakland, California, in 1936. The quintessential tiki cocktail, the Mai Tai, was concocted at the original Trader Vic's in 1944. He began opening franchises outside of California, beginning with The Outrigger in Seattle, WA in 1959. Bergeron eventually expanded the business across most of the country, and marketed tiki mugs, cocktail mixes, and other products for mass retail sale. Members of the Bergeron family still have a hand in the operations of at least one branch. The original restaurant in Oakland, California is now gone but there is still a Trader Vic's a few miles away in nearby Emeryville, California. Roughly 20 locations are operating throughout the world and bearing the iconic name. Other historical establishments Clifton's Pacific Seas postcard The Tiki Ti is a Polynesian-themed tiki bar in Los Angeles Prior to Don Beach opening his first tiki bar, during the 1920s South Pacific-influenced dreams of escapism had started to become more prevalent in American music and popular culture. The \\"kitschy\\" Clifton's Cafeteria opened in 1931 with some elements that today could be viewed as part of \\"tiki-like\\" thematics (indoor gardens with exotic travel themes), labeled by Tiki historian Sven Kirsten as pre-tiki and part of the \\"birth of Polynesian pop\\". In 1939 Clifton's Pacific Seas was remodeled to a full-blown exotic setting and decorated with 12 waterfalls, volcanic rock, and tropical foliage. The original restaurant was demolished, but a much smaller version in the form of a side-room bar named the Pacific Seas resides at another Clifton's location. The Tonga Room of the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco is an iconic tiki bar operating since 1945, still retaining its Polynesian flair after having undergone a number of facelifts over the years. At one time the Sheraton Hotel, Hilton Hotel, and Marriott Hotel chains all had several tiki bars incorporated into their establishments. From California, tiki spread north, and The Alibi Tiki Lounge is a currently operating tiki bar established in Portland, Oregon from 1947. The Kalua Room opened as part of the Windsor Hotel in Seattle in 1953 and was one of the first to put a tiki-like image next to their restaurant's name. The oldest operating tiki bar in Hawaii is the La Mariana Sailing Club Tiki Bar and Restaurant, established in 1957. The Hawaiian Village Hotel was the home to legendary tiki bartender Harry Yee. California's Tiki Ti is another historically important tiki establishment still in operation, as is Florida's Mai Kai, which is a focal spot for a large annual hukilau tiki gathering. Shelter Island, San Diego had at one time a heavily concentrated area of tiki bars, the best known being the still operating Bali Hai. In 1962, the now famous Kon Tiki Bar opened in Tucson, Arizona. Also in 1962, the Sip 'n Dip Lounge opened in Great Falls, Montana, bringing a tiki theme to the cold northern state and featuring a swimming pool where swimmers could be observed underwater from a window in the bar, a concept inspired by a similar design at the Playboy Club in Chicago. The Kahiki was a very large tiki restaurant and bar in Columbus, OH (since demolished). The Pago Pago Lounge was in Tucson, and the Chin Tiki and Mauna Loa were in Detroit (both closed). The Zombie Hut closed in 1990. Stephen Crane's The Luau restaurant is also gone but was considered historically important in the tiki craze's early days, as were Trader Vic's and Don the Beachcomber. Decline and revival An imitation mermaid swims at the Sip 'n Dip tiki bar in Montana The original tiki bars flourished for about 30 years, and then fell out of vogue. In the 1990s, the tiki culture was revived by a new generation of fans and new tiki bars were founded worldwide that often looked to Trader Vic's and Don the Beachcomber for inspiration. In that decade, the Sip 'n Dip Lounge, which had survived with its tiki theme intact, added the feature of having women dressed as mermaids swimming in their pool within view of the bar's patrons. The live mermaid incorporation and the overall retro tiki ambience led GQ Magazine to rate the lounge as one of the top 10 bars in the world for 2003.  Design and aesthetics  Tiki bar interior Exterior view of a tiki restaurant in New Orleans (1950s) Jardin Tiki Door Handles The Tonga Room lagoon The interiors and exteriors of tiki bars often include tiki masks and carvings, hula girl motifs, black velvet paintings, large tropical murals, live plants or palm trees, bamboo, grasscloth, tapa cloth, and similar fabrics, torches, woven fish traps, pufferfish lamps, glass floats, and the use of rock and lava stone. Indoor fountains, waterfalls, or even lagoons are popular features. Beyond Don Beach and Victor Bergeron, Stephen Crane was a well known promoter of the early tiki style, and was hired by Sheraton Hotels to design their Kon Tiki chain of establishments to compete with Hilton's Trader Vics. An early menu from his The Luau restaurant in Beverly Hills outlines where he got the materials for its decoration, including \\"chairs from Hong Kong\\", \\"Monkey pod furniture milled in Papaaloa\\", \\"structural bamboo hand-wrapped by Philippine craftsmen\\", \\"Chinese soapstone\\", the shells of \\"man-eating clams from the Indian ocean\\", and mentioning other materials from Nepa, Niiu, Samoa, Tahiti, Fuji, and of Tonga-Tabu origin. \\"Mick\\" Brownlee was the main wood carver for Donn Beach in Hawaii. After 1956 many designs were also accomplished with original work from the company Oceanic Arts, co-owned by Bob Van Oosting and Leroy Schmaltz in California, which imported materials and did original wood carvings. The tiki aesthetic was also refined by restaurant designers Clif and Lou Sawyer, who took part in over 360 design projects including at The Luau, Don the Beachcomber (Palm Springs, AZ), The Reef (Casper, Wyoming), and the Pago Pago (Tucson, AZ). Separate side rooms are employed, one of the earliest being \\"the black hole of Calcutta\\" as used by Donn Beach. Some of the biggest tiki restaurants are designed as large open air spaces with cavernous ceilings that allowed for the construction of separate areas with exotic names. The \\"cannibal room\\", \\"kon-tiki bar\\", \\"scorpion's den\\", and \\"trader's hut\\" could all be collected under one roof. Some like the Chin Tiki were multiple-level affairs, requiring patrons to climb stairs or cross bamboo bridges to get to other sections. The Kahiki Supper Club in Columbus, OH advertised as \\"The world's most elaborate Polynesian Supper Club\\" in Life Magazine and even provided its own interior map. This allowed keeping dinner show areas secluded away from more private drinking lounges, and lent to the \\"experience\\" by making patrons feel they had been transported away to an entire village. Limited windows or the use of fake windows with dioramas is done for similar reasons. Live animals are sometimes present. The now closed Bahooka Tiki bar was famous for its over one-hundred fish tanks. The look of the establishment's menu, swizzle sticks, matchbook covers, and cocktail napkins can be extremely important design considerations for tiki bars. These add to the exotic destination immersion and feel for the bar and are taken home by customers where they then become a form of outside advertising.  Drinks  A Mai Tai A Tiki drink Garnished cocktail A hallmark of tiki bars are specialty drinks, some of which may be unique to a bar and the recipes for which were often carefully guarded in order to prevent imitation from competing bars or from customers trying to recreate a drink at home. Multiple types of rums (light, dark, spiced, overproof and originating from various countries) are typically mixed together with orange liqueurs (Triple sec, Grand Marnier, Cointreau), tropical fruit juices, sweet syrups (falernum, fassionola, orgeat) and bitters. Many are bright in color, including more unusual cocktail colors such as blue (from Cura√ßao) and green hues (from Midori or Cr√®me de menthe). Some classic drink recipes from the early tiki era, many attributed to Don the Beachcomber or Trader Vic, include the: Blue Hawaii, Cobra's Fang, Coffee Grog, Corpse Reviver, Doctor Funk, Diki-Diki, Fog Cutter, Fu Manchu, Gold Cup, Head Hunter, Mai Tai, Navy Grog, Lapu Lapu, Mr. Bali Hai, Outrigger, Pago Pago, Pearl Diver, Py Yi, Planter's Punch, QB Cooler, Rum Barrel, Scorpion, Shark's Tooth, Shrunken Head, Singapore Sling, Suffering Bastard, Sumatra Kula, Test Pilot, Three Dots & A Dash, and the Zombie New tiki drinks continue to be created by a variety of bartenders and others. Jeff \\"Beachbum\\" Berry devised two cocktails in honor of new-wave tiki-pioneers Sven Kirsten and Otto Von Stroheim, with the Sven-Tiki and Otto's Grotto cocktails. He is also known from having created the Ancient Mariner and Von Tiki cocktails. Beyond fruit, cocktails are often garnished for customers with paper cocktail umbrellas, fancy swizzle sticks, live flowers or plastic animals. Cocktails can be very complicated and dramatic, often served in decorated ceramic vessels, employing dry ice or ice shells, or may be set on fire. The ordering of some drinks also triggers a serving ritual, such as the Mystery Drink that could result in the ringing of a gong and a hula dressed \\"mystery girl\\" bringing the beverage to the table; the mystery drink was once popular enough that Johnny Carson \\"ordered\\" it twice during the filming of The Tonight Show. Some drinks ordered at Disney's Enchanted Tiki Bar also result in certain things happening, such as the ordering of a Krakatoa Punch causing the picture of a faux volcano to erupt.  Tiki mugs and drink vessels  A \\"volcano bowl\\" flaming cocktail. thumb As the term is used generically, \\"tiki mugs\\" are ceramic drink vessels traditionally shaped as tikis, Easter Island statues (moai), shrunken heads, totems, coconuts, skulls, or in other Hawaiian, exotic, retro, or pirate- themed styles. The name of the bar is often listed on the back of the mug or its bottom. Wood may also be used, typically in the shapes of miniature barrels or boats. For some drinks actual fruit is used, such as hollowed-out pineapples or drilled coconuts with long straws that are used to serve customers. Although many are much bigger than a typical coffee mug, for drinks that are meant to be shared, larger capacities are required. A Scorpion Bowl (or Kava Bowl) is an oversized cocktail that is served in a large bowl for communal drinking. A variation on the Scorpion Bowl is the Flaming Volcano. Also a communal drink, the Flaming Volcano is traditionally served in a ceramic volcano bowl that has a raised crater reservoir typically filled with a small amount of overproof rum (151 or 160) and carefully lit on fire. Large shells or their ceramic counterparts are also sometimes used for communal drinks, such as in the Chin Tiki Special. Customers who want to keep a tiki mug can frequently do so for an additional fee. Mugs are often \\"taken\\" from the bar as a souvenir or collectible, and some mugs can be quite valuable.  Outside of the United States  \\"Beachcomber\\" Tiki bar in mid 1980s Scotland Although a largely American creation, tiki bars are not limited to the United States, and many others exist in Canada, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, particularly in Germany and the United Kingdom. At least three tiki bars opened in Australia in 2017. There are at least a dozen Trader Vic's locations in Europe and Asia, including in London, Tokyo, Munich, and Bangkok. The Trader Vic's franchise caters to its local clientele, and in London opened with a London Sour on its cocktail menu in 1965, and its Munich location with a Munich Sour in 1972. In 2017 noted tiki historians Sven Kirsten, Jeff Berry, Martin Cate, Brian Miller, and Chris Osburn listed their top 15 operating tiki bars in the world and included four in London, one in Munich, one in Tokyo, and one in Barcelona. Other judges included top- rated tiki bars in Paris, Hong Kong, and Berlin.  Home tiki bars  Tiki d√©cor as being used in a private tiki bar in Northern California Stone tiki carving In the wake of commercial tiki bars, during each wave of tiki popularity, home tiki bars were also built. Home bars often serve a dual purpose ‚Äî to create a recreational space in which to imbibe home-crafted cocktails, and to show off tiki collections of mugs, art, and other artifacts. Home tiki bars are built both inside and outside, sometimes as man caves. Those built outdoors are typically placed in backyard patios but are also erected on the shorelines of boat docks for people living on the water. Some of these home bars are simple but others are lavish enough to rival their commercial forebears. Not limited to America, many from around the world are uploaded onto internet sites and sometimes even toured.

She later worked at the Conservative Party's London offices. On 13 October 1962, Urquhart married Canadian-born Sir Philip Grant-Suttie, 8th Baronet. They had one son, and were divorced in 1969. It was during this divorce that she was introduced to Menzies Campbell by her barrister, future Conservative Member of Parliament Sir Nicholas Fairbairn. She married Campbell in June 1970 and this marriage is childless. Lady Campbell is known for her strong personality, and is believed to have persuaded her husband to stand in the 2006 Liberal Democrat leadership election, in which he was eventually victorious.Profile: Lady Campbell, BBC News, 2 March 2006 Lady Campbell is well known for hosting grand dinner parties.

It is bounded by the A89 road (Gallowgate) to the north and the A74 (London Road) to the south. History Being an area of working class housing enclosed by main roads and railway lines, Barrowfield consequently developed a distinctive character. The original 1930s council housing scheme flatsLaw St (c.1950), Virtual Mitchell (built to accommodate those cleared from Glasgow's 19th century slums in nearby areas such as Camlachie) became increasingly hard to let and were demolished in the 2000s to make way for more appealing houses. A small section of the original tenements remain around the junction of Law Street and Overtown Street, though extensively refurbished.Barrowfield police incident: man rushed to hospital after serious assault, Glasgow Live, 1 December 2019 In the 1950s the area changed from a working-class neighbourhood like most other areas of the city to being a place renowned for its gangs, namely \\"The Torch\\" and \\"The Spur\\" whose territory was respectively located at the north and south ends of the main thoroughfare;Watch The Blight: A Wonderful Documentary On Glasgow‚Äôs Barrowfield Gang Lands In 1982, Flashbak, 30 March 2014 Each terrorised the other's patch, and the area was so violent that the fighting diminished in the 1980s only because the gang leaders realised that dealing in drugs was more profitable. Unfortunately for the community, this meant the scheme had hundreds of drug abusers from all over Glasgow coming to the area to buy their \\"gear\\". Barrowfield therefore has a high mortality rate amongst the youth, largely due to drug abuse and suicide. In the early 21st century the area underwent a massive revamp, but the drug problem persists and crime is still high. In 2009, the data zone covering the neighbourhood was classed as the most deprived in Scotland.'Most deprived' areas identified, BBC News, 29 October 2009 Footballer James McArthurProgramme exclusive: McArthur on gritty Glasgow upbringing, Crystal Palace FC match programme, 1 September 2019 and actor Paul BranniganKevin Brannigan: East End drag artist on his battle to make his mark, Evening Times, 7 January 2019 grew up in Barrowfield in the 1990s. Sport A historic football stadium, Barrowfield Park, was the home ground of Clyde F.C. between 1877 and 1898 prior to their move to Shawfield Stadium, and also hosted matches for Eastern F.C. and Albatross. However the ground was actually located in the city's Dalmarnock neighbourhood, taking its name from the historic Barrowfield rural estate which once occupied much of the surrounding area. Modern housing in Barrowfield, with Celtic Park and Commonwealth Arena beyond (2013) For many years, Celtic F.C. conducted most of their training routines at a facility to the east of Celtic Park named Barrowfield, but it is also not within the boundaries of the present-day Barrowfield residential area west of the stadium. The source of this double naming stems from Junior club Bridgeton Waverley, who played at a ground named 'Barrowfield', lalso named after the historic estate and located approximately at Mountainblue Street today, until the 1930s when that land was bought over for construction of the new housing scheme (the Nelson Recreation Ground a few blocks away was also demolished). Waverley moved about east to the other site, part of Westthorn Park, and named their new ground 'New Barrowfield'. Celtic later took control of it as their training ground in the early 1960s and the Barrowfield name became familiar to many football fans as a result, however it may be assumed the training ground is the same place as the housing scheme, which is not technically correct. Today there are still football pitches on the land which are owned and used by the club.Celtic pitch plans for Barrowfield training ground expansion, Urban Realm, 6 June 2019Celtic to redevelop Barrowfield training ground, BBC Sport, 5 June 2019Celtic submit new training centre plans including indoor pitch at Barrowfield, Glasgow Times, 20 December 2019 After the 2014 Commonwealth Games was held in Glasgow, Barrowfield has international-class sporting facilities within walking distance: the Commonwealth Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome are located in nearby Dalmarnock.

A scale factor is used when a real-world set of numbers needs to be represented on a different scale in order to fit a specific number format. Although using a scale factor extends the range of representable values, it also decreases the precision, resulting in rounding error for certain calculations. Uses Certain number formats may be chosen for an application for convenience in programming, or because of certain advantages offered by the hardware for that number format. For instance, early processors did not natively support the IEEE floating-point standard for representing fractional values, so integers were used to store representations of the real world values by applying a scale factor to the real value. Similarly, because hardware arithmetic has a fixed width (commonly 16, 32, or 64 bits, depending on the data type), scale factors allow representation of larger numbers (by manually multiplying or dividing by the specified scale factor), though at the expense of precision. By necessity, this was done in software, since the hardware did not support fractional value. Scale factors are also used in floating-point numbers, and most commonly are powers of two. For example, the double-precision format sets aside 11 bits for the scaling factor (a binary exponent) and 53 bits for the significand, allowing various degrees of precision for representing different ranges of numbers, and expanding the range of representable numbers beyond what could be represented using 64 explicit bits (though at the cost of precision). As an example of where precision is lost, a 16-bit unsigned integer (uint16) can only hold a value as large as 65,53510. If unsigned 16-bit integers are used to represent values from 0 to 131,07010, then a scale factor of would be introduced, such that the scaled values correspond exactly to the real-world even integers. As a consequence, for example, the number 3 cannot be represented, because a stored 1 represents a real-world 2, and a stored 2 represents a real-world 4; there are not enough bits available to avoid this error in this representation. Operations on scaled values Once the scaled representation of a real value is stored, the scaling can often be ignored until the value needs to come back into the \\"real world\\". For instance, adding two scaled values is just as valid as unscaling the values, adding the real values, and then scaling the result, and the former is much easier and faster. In either approach, though, the two added numbers must be scaled the same. For other operations, the scaling is very important. Multiplication, for instance, needs to take into account that both numbers are scaled. As an example, consider two real world values A and B. The real world multiplication of these real world values is: A * B = P If they are instead represented with a scale factor of Z, and these scaled representations are subsequently multiplied, the result is the following: AZ * BZ = Q AZ is the scaled real world value of A, or simply the product of A * Z, and likewise, BZ is the scaled representation of B. After the scaled multiplication, the answer is not written PZ, because the value stored in PZ is not the answer. This can be seen by rearranging the statement, where each line in the following is equivalent: AZ * BZ = Q A * Z * B * Z = Q (A * B) * Z * Z = Q P * Z * Z = Q PZ * Z = Q In line 4, P substitutes A * B. It follows that the result of AZ * BZ (which is Q) is not PZ, but rather PZ * Z. If PZ were the answer, it could be stored directly since it has the scale factor built in, as is the case with addition and subtraction. For multiplication, however, the product of two scaled values has an extra scaling built in. As long as this is taken into account, there is still no need to convert AZ and BZ into A and B before performing the operation; the result must be divided by Z before storing it back. After this, PZ will be stored as the result of the multiplication, which is indeed the scaled representation of the result of A * B (the desired answer) rather than the result of AZ * BZ (which is still scaled). Common scaling scenarios Fractional values scaled to integers As previously described, many older processors (and possibly some current ones) do not natively support fractional mathematics. In this case, fractional values can be scaled into integers by multiplying them by ten to the power of whatever decimal precision is desired. In other words, to preserve n digits to the right of the decimal point, it is necessary to multiply the entire number by 10n. In computers, which perform calculations in binary, the real number is multiplied by 2m to preserve m digits to the right of the binary point; alternatively, one can bit shift the value m places to the left. For example, in the following set of real world fractional values, all have three digits to the right of the decimal point: 15.400, 0.133, 4.650, 1.000, 8.001 To save all of that information (in other words, not lose any precision), these numbers must be multiplied by 103 (1,000), giving integer values of: 15400, 133, 4650, 1000, 8001 Because of the value of the scaled numbers, they cannot be stored in 8bit integers; they will require at least 14 unsigned bits, or, more realistically, 16. Integer values to fractions Certain processors, particularly DSPs common in the embedded system industry, have built in support for the fixed- point arithmetic, such as Q and IQ formats. Since the fractional part of a number takes up some bits in the field, the range of values possible in a fixed9point value is less than the same number of bits would provide to an integer. For instance, in an 8 bit field, an unsigned integer can store values from [0, 255], but an unsigned fixed-point with 5 bits allocated to the fractional part only has 3 bits left over for the integer value, and so can only store integer values from [0, 7]. (The number of distinct values that the two fields can store is the same, 28 = 256, because the fixed-point field can also store 32 fractional values for each integer value.) It is therefore common that a scaling factor is used to store real world values that may be larger than the maximum value of the fixed-point format. As an example, when using an unsigned 8-bit fixed-point format (which has 4 integer bits and 4 fractional bits), the highest representable integer value is 15, and the highest representable mixed value is 15.9375 (0xF.F or 1111.1111b). If the desired real world values are in the range [0,160], they must be scaled to fit within this fixed-point representation. A scale factor of cannot be used here, because scaling 160 by gives 16, which is greater than the greatest value that can be stored in this fixed-point format. However, will work as a scale factor, because the maximum scaled value, = 14., fits within this range. Given this set: 154, 101, 54, 3, 0, 160 Scaling these with the scale factor gives the following values: 154/11 = 14 101/11 = 9.1818... 54/11 = 4.9090... 3/11 = 0.2727... 0/11 = 0 160/11 = 14.5454... Many of these values have been truncated because they contain repeating decimals, which follows from the chosen scale factor (elevenths do not terminate in decimal). When storing these in our fixed-point format, some precision will be lost (in contrast to the exact values of the original integers). This is also a problem because an 8-bit format can store 256 different values, but the numbers in this set are from a range with only 161 possible values (0 through 160). As it turns out, the problem was the scale factor, , which introduced unnecessary precision requirements and rounding error (when approximating a real value with the nearest representable value). To avoid or resolve this problem, one must choose a better scale factor. Choosing a scale factor The example above illustrates how certain scale factors can cause unnecessary precision loss or rounding error, highlighting the importance of choosing the right scale factor. Using the scale factor of and converting to binary representations, the following values are obtained: 154/11 = 14 = 1110.0 101/11 = 9.1818... = 1001.00101110... 54/11 = 4.9090... = 100.111010... 3/11 = 0.2727... = 0.010010... 0/11 = 0 = 0.0 160/11 = 14.5454... = 1110.10010... Several of the binary fractions require more than the four fractional bits provided by the set fixed-point format. (This is in part because elevenths do not terminate in binary either.) To fit them into the fields (4 integer and 4 fractional bits), it is possible to truncate the remaining bits, giving the following stored representations: 1110.0000 1001.0010 0100.1110 0000.0100 0000.0000 1110.1001 Or in decimal: 14.0 9.125 4.875 0.25 0.0 14.5625 When they are called back into the real world, they are divided by the scale factor, . This is the inverse of the original scaling, giving the following \\"real world\\" values: 154.0 100.375 53.625 2.75 0 160.1875 These values are not equivalent to the originals (before scaling down and fitting into this 8-bit representation). Most noticeably, they are not all integers anymore, immediately indicating that an error was introduced in the storage, due to a poor choice of scaling factor. =Choosing a better scale factor= Most data sets will not have a perfect scale factor; most likely, there will be some error introduced by the scaling process. However, it may be possible to choose a better scale factor. The ideal scale factor may not be the smallest, but rather one that preserves as much precision as possible. Dividing a number by a power of two is the same as shifting all the bits to the right once for each power of two. (This is the binary equivalent to shifting all decimal digits to the left or right when, respectively, multiplying or dividing by powers of ten.) The pattern of bits does not change, it just moves the number of places equal to the binary exponent (for instance, 3 places to the right when dividing by 8 = 23). On the other hand, when dividing by a number that is not an integer power of two in binary, the bit pattern changes. This is likely to produce a bit pattern with more bits to the right of the binary point, artificially introducing required precision. This is especially true when the fractional part has a denominator that is not a power of two, as all fractions not reciprocals of powers of two recur in binary. Therefore, it is almost always preferable to use a scale factor that is a power of two. It may still be possible to lose bits that get shifted right off the end of the field as a result of truncation, but this avoids introducing new bits that will be imprecise (due to rounding error) or truncated. As an illustration the use of powers of two in the scale factor, a scale factor of can be applied to the above data set. The binary values for the original data set are given below: 154 = 1001 1010 101 = 0110 0101 54 = 0011 0110 3 = 0000 0011 0 = 0000 0000 160 = 1010 0000 Being integers between 0 and 255, these all can be represented precisely with 8 bits. Scaling these by is the same as dividing by 16, which is the same as shifting the bits 4 places to the right. In this case, scaling is done by inserting a binary point between the first 4 bits and last 4 bits of each number. That happens to equal the predetermined format of this representation. Consequently, since all these numbers do not require more than 8 bits to represent them as integers, no more than 8 bits are required to scale them down and store them in a fixed-point format.

Hergott was born at Freiburg in the Breisgau. After studying humanities at Freiburg and Strasburg, he became tutor in a private family at the latter place and accompanied his two pupils to Paris, where he remained two years. Upon his return to Germany he entered the Benedictine Abbey of St. Blasien in the Black Forest, made his vows on 17 November 1715, and was sent to Rome to study theology. After being ordained priest on 17 Dec., 1718, he returned to St. Blasien. In 1721 he went to the Abbey of St. Gall to study Oriental languages, but was soon recalled in order to accompany his abbot to Vienna, where he devoted himself for a few months to the study of history. Shortly after, he was sent to the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s to continue his historical studies under the direction of the learned Maurist Benedictines. The first fruit of these studies was a valuable work on old monastic customs, Vetus disciplina monastica (Paris, 1726). Shortly after the publication of this work, Herrgott returned to St. Blasien, gathered material for a history of the Diocese of Constance and wrote a history of St. Blasien, which is preserved in manuscript at St. Paul's Abbey in Carinthia. In 1728 he was sent to the imperial Court of Vienna as diplomatic representative of the Estates of Breisgau, which then belonged to Austria, and filled this position very creditably over twenty years. While at Vienna he made a thorough study of the history of the imperial house of Habsburg and, after eight years of research, published the first three volumes of his valuable work on the Austrian Imperial family Genealogia diplomatica Augusta Gentis Habsburgic√¶ (Vienna, 1737). The continuation of this work he published under the title Monumenta August√¶ Domus Austriac√¶, vol. I (Vienna, 1750), vol. II (Freiburg, 1753), vol. III (Freiburg, 1760), second edition (St. Blasien, 1773). As reward for his labours he had been appointed imperial councillor and historiographer in 1737. In 1749 he gave offence to the imperial Court by defending the rights of the Church and the privileges of the Estates, and, in consequence, was forced to resign his office. His abbot appointed him provost of Krozingen and governor of Staufen and Kirchhofen, which were dependencies of the Abbey of St. Blasien. He died at Krozingen near Freiburg.

There are over 300 classic cars on display from the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust and the Jaguar Heritage Trust. History The collection, now cared for by the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust, was developed in the 1970s when a new division of the British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC) was formed to preserve and manage the company's collection of historic vehicles. In 1979, the company became BL Heritage Limited, adopting a new headquarters at Studley, Warwickshire. Two years later, a museum was opened at the London Transport Museum's former home of Syon Park, west of London, where some 100 vehicles from the collection were put on display. During the early 1980s, closer ties were made with other British motor manufacturers. In 1983, the collection was granted charitable status, and became the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust, and although there were now several manufacturers involved, the collection still carried a large bias towards the former British Leyland companies. Austin-Rover continued as the primary backer of the Trust, and gradually the other companies withdrew their support. Meanwhile, the collection continued to grow. In the late 1980s, it became evident that larger premises would be required as the collection developed. Several new sites were considered for a purpose built museum. The present location was chosen, on the site of the former RAF Gaydon airfield in South Warwickshire, which was home to the Rover Group's design, technology and testing ground. Plans were drawn up and construction began in 1991 for the new Heritage Motor Centre. Set in of grounds, the centre brought together all of the Trust's operations for the first time, providing exhibition and storage space for the collection of over 250 vehicles and archive of over 2 million photographs, business records, brochures and drawings. The site also includes conference facilities. When Rover Group was taken over by BMW in 1994, the British Motor Museum came under their ownership. Six years later, BMW sold the Rover Group, which meant that the Centre changed hands yet again, this time under the ownership of the Ford Motor Company. This latest change of ownership means that the Trust now had the opportunity to expand its collection to include all of the companies that have formed part of Britain's motor manufacturing history. Following Jaguar's decision to close their Jaguar Daimler Heritage Centre, a small selection of the Jaguar Daimler Heritage Collection has been on display at the Museum. In November 2015 the Heritage Motor Centre closed for a ¬£1.1 million refurbishment, and reopened on 13 February 2016 under the new name of British Motor Museum.

Early days Born Hilliard Gates Gudelsky, Hilliard used his middle name, Gates, as he entered broadcasting at a station in Muskegon, Michigan. Gates moved his career to WOWO radio, at that time a 10,000-watt clear channel radio station in Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1940. During World War II he entered the Army Air Corps and was stationed at near-by Baer Field, which allowed him to continue his career at WOWO part-time. After the war he supervised the construction of WKJG radio which went on the air in November 1947 with Gates as General Manager and part owner. The station was largely owned by the Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette, which in turn was owned by William Kunkel. An acronym of this combination provided the station call letters. He put WKJG-FM on the air in June 1948 and in November 1953, was the first person to appear live on Fort Wayne television when he signed WKJG-TV onto the air. His segment Gatesway to Sports was very popular with Fort Wayne viewers. Sports announcing Gates was highly respected as a sports announcer well outside northern Indiana. When tiny Milan High School won the state basketball championship at Butler University's Hinkle Fieldhouse in 1954, Hilliard Gates was at the microphone - and his delivery was so powerful and distinctive that he was also used as the announcer in the 1986 movie, Hoosiers, a fictionalized story based on the Milan team's accomplishments. Hilliard was the announcer who first introduced many sports to Fort Wayne television. He appeared on more network broadcasts than any other announcer in Indiana history, and in 1967 and 1968, he broadcast the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California for NBC radio. Hilliard was named Indiana Sportscaster of the Year seven times and was nominated for the honor 20 consecutive years. He was the first broadcaster to be inducted into the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame (1969). In 1977, the Indiana Basketball Coaches Association cited him for his long contribution to Indiana basketball. Station management During his tenure as vice-president and general manager of WKJG-TV, the station was proud of having hired many talented beginners who eventually moved on to larger markets and bigger paychecks. However, this was probably a consequence of their low budgets. For years, WKJG's news broadcasts were assured good ratings simply on the basis of their sports coverage. In the 1980s, competitors fought aggressively for the news viewer with upgraded sets, larger staffs, personable newscasters, and enhanced production graphics, with WPTA, youngest of the three major network affiliates, highest in the ratings. Retirement Gates retired as vice president and general manager of WKJG-TV in 1990 and served as a consultant to the station until May 1993 before his death 1996. After Gates' death, WKJG-TV fared even more poorly. New station management attempted a facelift, even changing the call letters to WISE-TV, but without much success. Community leadership and honors Gates held office in many community and state organizations. He was on the original Jaycees committee that got the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum built in 1951. He was twice elected president of the Fort Wayne Press Club. *Indiana Governor Roger D.

The two-hour movie aired in syndication. Plot Shaggy discovers that his uncle Colonel Beauregard has died and left him his country estate, which is on a plantation. After being chased away by a ghost witch, Shaggy, Scooby and Scrappy head for the estate in order to claim Shaggy's inheritance. Before they can get there, they meet Sheriff Rufus Buzby, who warns them about the whole estate being haunted and that they should leave. Before he can fully convince them, he receives a call from the mayor, notifying him that a circus train has derailed and a circus ape has escaped. Leaving Shaggy, Scooby and Scrappy, they continue driving, but upon their arrival they are pursued by a headless horseman, a ghost wolf, and by the alleged ghost of the Colonel who taunts them, telling them to leave or else they will face the consequences. They also meet the creepy manservant Farquard who tells them that a vast fortune in jewels is hidden somewhere on the estate, which he believes is rightfully his and that Shaggy has no business there. Initially, Shaggy wants to leave, but before they can do that, his truck sinks into quicksand, forcing him, Scooby and Scrappy to spend the night there. With ghosts haunting the place, Scrappy has the idea to call a group of ghost exterminators called The Boo Brothers. To the guys' surprise, the exterminators themselves are ghosts, who proceed to hunt down the ghosts that are haunting the estate, with little success. On top of all, Shaggy meets Sadie Mae Scroggins and her shotgun totting older brother Billy Bob Scroggins whose family has an old feud with the colonel. After knowing that Shaggy is related to the colonel, Sadie falls in love with him and Billy Bob wants to shoot him. After things calm down a little, Shaggy, Scooby and Scrappy decide to go to the kitchen to eat something, only to find proof that the famous fortune in jewels is real, when they find a diamond with a clue to a treasure hunt. Intrigued by that very first clue, the gang decides to hunt down the rest of the jewels much to Farquard's chagrin and Sheriff Buzby, who is on the trail of an escaped circus ape, and is skeptical about the jewels' existence. They follow the trail through a number of clues that the Colonel has hidden for them, which takes them to several different points in the mansion and also in the rest of the plantation. As they progress in their treasure hunt, things become harder, with numerous ghosts appearing, including the Ghost of Colonel Beauregard, the Headless Horseman, and the Skull Ghost. To make matters worse, they also have to deal with Billy Bob Scroggins and his sister Sadie Mae, and the escaped Ape, who keep showing up. On top of that, the Boo Brothers reveal themselves incapable of getting rid of any ghost, only causing more mayhem whenever they try to help. After much treasure hunting, they finally find the last clue, revealing that the treasure is hidden in the mansion's fireplace, much to the happiness of the Skull Ghost, who holds the gang at gun point, and tries to claim it for himself. After catching him, they find out that the person behind the Skull Ghost is the Sheriff. As they unmask the ghost, the real Sheriff comes in, revealing that the Skull Ghost is actually his greedy twin brother, T.J. Buzby impersonating him, as well as the remaining ghosts that were haunting the place. With the treasure found, Shaggy is taken by the Boo Brothers' story that they need a home to haunt, so he turns the mansion over to them and the treasure is put into the Beauregard Trust Fund for Orphans. Saying their goodbyes, Shaggy and the dogs drive back home. Along the way, they encounter once more the ghost of Colonel Beauregard, which Shaggy thinks is another prank of Scooby's, until he realizes it's real, and speeds away as fast as possible. The Clues In order to find the treasure, Shaggy's Uncle Beauregard left various clues for them to follow in a treasure hunt. With each clue, there is also a piece of the treasure. Starting at the freezer, where they find a diamond inside an ice cube tray, the clues and the treasure that is found near them are: * Dear Shaggy, knowing your appetite, I thought this would be the best place to hide this message and this jewel. It is only one of many in my fortune, which I hid to keep them away from my enemies. To find the next clue to their hiding place, go outside. Then look for the part of the house with its knee out. - Chimney (Diamond) * You're nearer the family jewels than before. A broken key unlocks the next door. - Piano (Diamond) * Look for a relative who is quite old, whose face cannot look and whose hands cannot hold. - Grandfather Clock (Diamond) * There is no pendulum in this clock, so what does it lack besides a tock? - Attic (Gold and diamond necklace) * For the next clue, don't look any higher. Just think what you're called when you're not the buyer. - Cellar (Gold and diamond tiara) * The next clue you seek is large and flat. It's the kind of stone you wear as a hat. - Colonel Beauregard's headstone in cemetery (Jeweled brooch) * You're nearing the end of this obstacle course, so if you go buggy, you won't need a horse. - Barn (Ruby) * To get to the bottom of things is the trick. Think how you're feeling when you're not sick. - Well (Pearl necklace) * At the end of this tunnel are many more pearls. But on the way are many more perils. - Basement (Pearl necklace) * There's no mystery about the next clue. Inside Bear Cave, the jewel's in plain view.- Bear Cave (Pearl and ruby necklace) * Go to a place that covers the tide.

Preparing for Emergencies was a public information campaign produced by the Home Office, a department of the United Kingdom Government, advising British citizens on what to do in the event of a natural disaster, accident or terrorism. The campaign began on 26 July 2004 in the wake of several major disasters including the 11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings, SARS and the 2001 UK foot and mouth crisis, in the form of a 22-page booklet which covered topics such as transport accidents, health, foot and mouth disease, terrorism and fire safety.Terror advice pamphlet unveiled, BBC News, 2004 The booklet was distributed to all UK households but received some criticism - comparing it to Protect and Survive, a 1980s series of public information films and a booklet that instructed people on how to remain safe from nuclear war. Some sections of the media also accused the government of \\"scaremongering\\", although information was provided on topics other than terrorism. Soon after the website accompanying the booklet was launched, a spoof website created by Tom Scott (www.preparingforemergencies.co.uk) appeared, said to be from the \\"HM Department of Vague Paranoia\\"; it parodied the seemingly obvious advice given by the booklets, and gave such advice as: \\"Alien Invasion: Negotiate using sign language, if possible. Failing that, and assuming they aren't armed with futuristic ray guns, run like hell.\\" Also, the spoof site references the Simon Pegg and Nick Frost film Shaun of the Dead, by saying \\"The assailants can be stopped by removing the head or destroying the brain. Suitable tools you may find in your shed include shovels, cricket bats, and similar items.\\" Spoof website will stay online, BBC News, 2004 The Home Office initially objected to the website, stating that the URL was too similar to that of their own website, www.preparingforemergencies.gov.uk, and threatened to close the website down. However, after a link to the official website was added, the Home Office conceded the issue, and allowed the site to remain online. Following the original distribution, no more booklets have been produced, although the website was updated with advice on possible bird flu epidemics and the 7 July 2005 London bombings. In 2011/12 the website was permanently closed, and official emergency preparedness information HM Government guidance, Cabinet Office, 2016 for the UK was moved to the gov.uk website. The spoof website is still online, as of 2020. Logo The parts of the logo are used to indicate resources or actions to follow in an emergency. From left to right, they are: *\\"i\\" on blue background - information *\\"999\\" on purple background - What to do in an emergency (Emergency Services) *right arrow on green background - Go in *lock on red background - Stay in *dash on yellow background - Tune in (to local radio or television) *cross on turquoise background - administer first aid The logo is still used by local government organisations giving information on civil defence. The development of the logo cost ¬£17,000 in 2004. See also *Protect and Survive *Ready.gov, the United States Department of Homeland Security version of same.

Its chief tenant is The New York Times Company, publisher of The New York Times as well as the International New York Times, and other newspapers. The building is tall to its pinnacle, with a roof height of , and contains 52 stories. The building was erected from 2003 to 2007 as the Times' headquarters at a cost of $850 million. The structure was designed by Renzo Piano Building Workshop in association with FXFOWLE Architects. Construction was undertaken by a joint venture of The New York Times Company, Forest City Ratner (Forest City Enterprises's New York subsidiary), and ING Real Estate. , The New York Times Building is tied with the Chrysler Building as the eleventh-tallest building in the city. History Image of building taken in 1904 Previous sites The original newspaper headquarters in 1851 were at 113 Nassau Street, then a few years later at 138 Nassau Street. In 1858, the Times moved to a five-story edifice at 41 Park Row; thirty years later, partially in response to a new tower erected by the competing New-York Tribune, it commissioned a new 13-story building at the same site, one that remains in use by Pace University with some modifications. In 1904, again partially in response to the Herald Square headquarters of the New York Herald, the paper moved to perhaps its most famous location, the Times Tower, on the site of the Pabst Hotel. The name of the surrounding area changed from Longacre Square to Times Square. The paper outgrew the slender tower within a decade and, in 1913, moved into the Times Annex at 229 West 43rd Street, where it remained for almost a century. New building  Height comparison of New York City buildings, with the New York Times Building on the right =Construction= The project was announced on December 13, 2001, as a 52-story tower on the east side of Eighth Avenue between 40th and 41st Street across from the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey Bus Terminal. The project, in conjunction with the Hearst Tower, represented the further westward expansion of Midtown along Eighth Avenue, a corridor that had seen no construction since the 1989 completion of One Worldwide Plaza. The new building‚Äîcalled by many New Yorkers \\"The New Times Tower\\"‚Äîalso kept the paper in the Times Square area, its namesake. The site for the building was obtained by the Empire State Development Corporation (ESDC) through eminent domain. With a mandate to acquire and redevelop blighted properties in Times Square, ten buildings were condemned by the ESDC and purchased from their owners. Some owners sued, asserting that the area was no longer blighted, but lost in court. Once the site was assembled, it was leased to The New York Times Company and Forest City Ratner for $85.6 million over 99 years (considerably below market value). Additionally, The New York Times Company received $26.1 million in tax breaks. =Occupancy= Shortly after completion, in 2009 the Times sold their ownership stake in the tower's leasehold to W. P. Carey for $225 million. In exchange, the Times would lease back their floors for $24 million a year for 10 years, a price far below the market value of the space. The Times itself occupies on the 2nd to 21st floors, with the remainder leased to tenants. Law firm Covington & Burling also occupies in the building, taking up floors 39 through 44. On December 16, 2016, The New York Times announced that it was vacating at least 8 floors totaling in order to generate rental income and save costs. In January 2018, financial firm Liquidnet announced they would take half the available space, signing a sublease for over in the building. The Times also announced in February 2018 that they would be exercising the option to repurchase the building's leasehold from W.P. Carey for $250 million in 2019. In November 2018, UK-based outsourcing firm Williams Lea Tag signed a 10-year lease for all of space on the 10th floor of the building. The next year, in November 2019, the Times exercised its option to repurchase the leasehold. Design The tower was designed by Renzo Piano Building Workshop and FXFOWLE Architects, with Gensler providing interior design. The lighting design for the building's nighttime identity was designed by the Office for Visual Interaction Inc. The tower rises from the street to its roof, with the exterior curtain wall extending higher to , and a mast rising to . , The New York Times Building is the eleventh-tallest building in the city, tied with the Chrysler Building. The steel-framed building, cruciform in plan, has a screen of \\" (41.3 mm) ceramic rods mounted on the exterior of the glass curtain wall on the east, west and south facades. The rod spacing increases from the base to the top, adding transparency as the building rises. The steel framing and bracing is exposed at the four corner \\"notches\\" of the building. NYTimes Building under construction.jpgThe building under construction in September 2006 Atrium NY Times Building jeh.JPGGround floor atrium New York Times Building 0210.JPGThe main entrance on Eighth Avenue New York Times newsroom.jpgThe New York Times newsroom  Sustainability  The new building is promoted as a green structure. The design incorporates numerous environmentally sustainable features for increased energy efficiency. The double-skin curtain wall, automated louver shading system, dimmable lighting system, underfloor air distribution system and cogeneration are the main sustainable design features. =Double-skin curtain wall= The use of floor-to-ceiling glass maximizes light and views for people inside and outside the building. The horizontal white ceramic rods on the building facade, which are spaced to allow occupants to have unobstructed views while both seated and standing, act as an aesthetic veil and a sun shade. They are made of aluminum silicate, an extremely dense and high-quality ceramic chosen for its durability and cost-effectiveness. Glazed with a finish similar to the material used on terracotta to reflect light, self-clean, and resist weather, the rods change color with the sun and weather. Additionally, the automated louver shades move in response to the position of the sun and inputs from sensors, blocking light to reduce glare or allowing it to enter at times of less direct sunlight. The movable shades reduce energy consumption about 13% by reducing solar heat gain by 30%. =Lighting system= In a normal office building, lights usually consume about 44% of total energy. The New York Times Building uses less, because its design, lighting, and shading systems allow the sun to be the main source of light. Each of the more than 18,000 electrical ballasts in the lighting system contains a computer chip, allowing each room's lights to brighten or dim depending on whether a room is occupied and how bright the sun is. =Underfloor air distribution= The New York Times Company utilizes an underfloor air distribution system (UFAD) which strives for better indoor air quality, thermal comfort as well as energy saving. The conditioned air from the air handler is delivered through an air highway system that circumnavigates the service core and then into the six zoned off underfloor low pressure zones for distribution across the floor plate to all floor diffusers. Around each perimeter a series of fan power boxes control the temperature in the space. If heating is required then the fans turn on delivering heat via a hot water coil. In cooling mode, the fans operate to give increased ventilation around the perimeter spaces. Fresh air is supplied by two air handling units on the 28th floor sending fresh treated outside air to each floor where a constant volume VAV controls the amount of air entering the system. The air is then conditioned for proper cooling and humidity before being sent to the air highway. The New York Times Building also benefits from other general UFAD advantages. In the open plan office space that was implemented in occupied space from 2nd to 21st floors to enhance daylighting and outdoor views, the system provides flexibility to place the required equipment anywhere on the raised integrated service plenum. When departments or occupants needed to be reconfigured, the raised floor also enables maintenance to carry out changes at relatively lower expense. =Cogeneration on site= The New York Times Building incorporates a cogeneration plant to supply its 24-7 operation and 40% of the power used. Located in a mechanical room at the far end of the podium's top floor, the plant consists of two natural gas fired reciprocating engine driven generators with a total generating capacity of 1.5 MW of electrical power. It recovers the heat produced by combustion and converts the heat into usable energy in the form of hot water. The recovered hot water serves as the building's heating loop to provide warmth during the winter and functions as a refrigeration machine to provide cooling during the summer. The power from the grid is solely used by the building as a backup source. =Other features= In excess of 95% of the structural steel was recycled. The building, like many in Midtown Manhattan, has no on-site parking, with most employees arriving by public transit (the New York City Subway's Times Square station and the Port Authority Bus Terminal are in the immediate vicinity). =Overall performance= A team of researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and Center for the Built Environment monitored the building's performance for a year and compared the results with buildings that meet with the standard building efficiency codes. They found that the New York Times Building significantly reduced annual electricity, cut heating energy use by more than 50% and decrease the peak electric demand as well. \\"It is essential to start with a sound, integrated building design, and then to pay attention to details such as procurement of building equipment, and verifying the proper performance of the equipment after it is installed. The Times Company did its homework in 2004, well before construction began on the building, evaluating and optimizing the shading and daylighting technologies,\\" concluded the Berkeley researchers. Climbers alt=Alain Robert climbs the New York Times building on June 5, 2008 In mid-2008, three men illegally climbed the external facade of The New York Times Building within a month of each other, the first two on the same day; the three climbers were not associated with one another. On June 5, 2008, professional climber Alain Robert, dubbed \\"The French Spiderman\\", climbed the north side of The New York Times Building. He was able to scale the building from first floor all the way to the roof. During his climb, Robert attached a fluorescent green neon sign to the building that read \\"Global warming kills more people than a 9/11 every week\\". Robert also wore a t-shirt promoting the website \\"The Solution is Simple\\". Robert was met on the roof by the NYPD emergency service unit team where he was put in a harness to ensure he did not fall and placed under arrest. Later that day, a second climber scaled the western face of the building. He also was arrested for climbing the building facade after reaching the roof. The climber, 32-year-old Brooklyn resident Renaldo Clarke, was wearing a T-shirt with the words \\"Malaria No More\\" written on it. The third climber in mid-2008 was David Malone, 29, from Connecticut, who also scaled the west side of the building on July 9, 2008. Unlike the two previous climbers, Malone did not attempt to make it to the roof. He hung a banner around the fifth floor upon the first \\"T\\" of The New York Times sign, that had a picture of Osama Bin Laden holding Bush like a puppet‚Äî\\"Bin Laden's Plan\\" (the title of his book and website). He then climbed higher, stopping at the 11th floor, and remained hanging on the building for four hours before being arrested. Malone said he was protesting Al Qaeda's \\"crusader baiting\\", and \\"intentional provocation of the U.S.\\" On March 24, 2012, a homeless man was caught climbing the building. He made it to the 5th floor before getting stuck, and was eventually arrested. On October 15, 2020, a man climbed to the 6th floor of the building before being taken into custody by the NYPD. https://www.fox5ny.com/news/man-in-custody-after- climbing-new-york-times-building-in-manhattan See also * List of tallest buildings in New York City * List of tallest buildings in the United States * List of tallest freestanding structures in the world * List of tallest freestanding steel structures  References  External links * * New York Times Tower on CTBUH Skyscraper Center * Category:2007 establishments in New York City Category:Eighth Avenue (Manhattan) Category:Forest City Realty Trust Category:Midtown Manhattan Category:Modernist architecture in New York City Category:The New York Times Category:Newspaper buildings Category:Newspaper headquarters in the United States Category:Office buildings completed in 2007 Category:Renzo Piano buildings Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Manhattan Category:CTBUH Tall Building Award winners ","title":"The New York Times Building"},{"id":"4252109","text":"{ style=\\"margin:5px; border:1px solid #8888AA;\\" align=right cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3 width=280 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#0000ff\\" colspan=2 Staunton Braves - align=\\"center\\" - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\"  Founded  1915 - align=\\"center\\"  Field  Moxie Stadium - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\"  Team History  Staunton Braves Class C Virginia League (1915‚Äì1944) Massanutten League (1945‚Äì1949) VBL (1950‚Äìpresent) - align=\\"center\\" - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\"  Division  Southern - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\"  Championships  7 (1954) (1957) (1976) (1985) (1995) (1996) (1999) - align=\\"center\\" - align=\\"center\\" - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\"  Runner-Up  8 (1960) (1964) (1969) (1998) (2000) (2004) (2006) (2015) - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\"  Owner  Kay Snyder, Boyd Snyder - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\"  Head Coach  Samuel Blalock (1st season) - align=\\"center\\" } The Staunton Braves are a collegiate summer baseball team in Staunton, Virginia.

It is the largest grammar school in Omagh. History The school was founded on 14 January 1861, on Mount St. Columba. The building has since gone into other use as a retreat. A primary school, Holy Trinity (previously St Colmcille), has been the school there since. Its original headmaster was Brother John Redmond. On its first day of activity one hundred and twenty boys, all aged between five and fifteen, showed up. In 1902 an extension, a second floor to the school and a third to the brothers' house, was added. This came at the time a considerable cost of ¬£1,200 partly financed by an ¬£800 loan from past pupils. Operations of the school were moved to old Church, Brook Street while construction was under way. Once finished the renovations provided the school with three more rooms; one for Manual Instruction, a sixty student accommodating classroom and a room with all the necessities for Practical and Experimental Science. The school moved to is present site on Kevlin Road in 1967. In 1993, after the resignation of Brother McCrohan, the school appointed its first non-clerical headmaster, Roddy Tierney, a former pupil of the school and a teacher in the school. At present the Principal is Mr. Foncy McConnell who was appointed Principal in March 2016, having being acting Principal for the previous year. At the time of appointment he was Vice Principal having taught in the school since 1987. Like Mr. Tierney he is also a former pupil of Omagh CBS. Academics The school's focus is academic, offering compulsory subjects of English Literature, English Language, Science, and Mathematics until GCSE. The School also focuses on the teachings of the Catholic faith, making Religious Studies compulsory at GCSE, and as a subsidiary weekly lesson during A Level years. In 2018, 94.2% of its entrants achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A* to C, including the core subjects English and Maths. In 2019 the school was ranked 18th out of 159 secondary schools in Northern Ireland with 86.7% of its A-level students who sat the exams in 2017/18 being awarded three A*-C grades. Sports In Gaelic football, the school has won the MacRory Cup (the highest level for Ulster schools) in 1974, 2001, 2005 and 2007, and the All Ireland Hogan Cup in 2007. and many other under-age level competitions for example Omagh CBS won the Rannafast Cup in 2009 and 2012 and the McCormick cup in 2008, 2009 and 2011 Notable former pupils * Phil Taggart - radio presenterhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2018/phil-taggart-super- assembly See also *Christian Brothers of Ireland *Edmund Rice References External links * Category:Congregation of Christian Brothers secondary schools in Northern Ireland Category:Grammar schools in County Tyrone Category:Omagh Category:Boys' schools in Northern Ireland * Category:Educational institutions established in 1861 Category:1861 establishments in Ireland Category:Catholic secondary schools in Northern Ireland ","title":"Christian Brothers Grammar School, Omagh"},{"id":"4252112","text":"The Kamata Kingdom (pron: Ààk åm…ôt…ë) emerged in western Kamarupa probably when Sandhya, a ruler of Kamarupanagara, moved his capital west to Kamatapur sometime after 1257 CE.\\"Kamarupa was reorganized as a new state. 'Kamata' by name with Kamatapur as capital. The exact time when the change was made is uncertain. But possibly it had been made by Sandhya (c1250-1270) as a safeguard against mounting dangers from the east and the west. Its control on the eastern regions beyond the Manah (Manas river) was lax.\\" Since it originated in the old seat of the Kamarupa kingdom, and since it covered most of the western parts of it, the kingdom is also sometimes called as Kamarupa- Kamata. It covered a region corresponding to present-day undivided districts of Kamrup, Goalpara, Jalpaiguri, and Koch Behar in India and Rangpur and northern parts of Mymensingh in Bangladesh. The rise of the Kamata kingdom marked the end of the ancient period in the history of Assam and the beginning of the medieval period. The last rulers were the Khens, who were later displaced in 1498 by Alauddin Hussain Shah, the Turko-Afghan ruler of Gauda. Though Hussain Shah developed extensive administrative structures, he lost political control to a confederation of Baro-Bhuyan within a few years. Biswa Singha removed Baro-Bhuyan confederacy and established the Koch dynasty soon, in 1515. The Koches were the last to call themselves Kamateshwars (the rulers of Kamata), but their influence and expansions were so extensive and far- reaching that their kingdom is sometimes called the Koch Kingdom. In the same century the kingdom split in two: Koch Bihar and Koch Hajo. The eastern kingdom, Koch Hajo, was soon absorbed into the Ahom kingdom in the 17th century. The western portion of the Kamata kingdom, Koch Bihar, continued to be ruled by a branch of the Koch dynasty and later merged with the Indian territory after the independence of India from the British domain.http://coochbehar.nic.in/htmfiles/royal_history2.html The boundary between Koch Bihar and Koch Hajo is approximately the boundary between West Bengal and Assam today. Rulers of Kamata kingdom Early rulers Sandhya, was a ruler of Kamarupanagara, the capital of the erstwhile Kamarupa. After withstanding an attack from Malik Ikhtiyaruddin Iuzbak, in which Iuzbak was killed (in 1257), Sandhya moved his capital to Kamatapur, near present-day Cooch Behar town. Sandhya styled himself Kamateswara and the kingdom came to be known as Kamata. * Sandhya (1228‚Äì1260) * Sindhu Rai (1260‚Äì1285) * Rup Narayan (1285‚Äì1300) * Singhadhwaj (1300‚Äì1305) Middle rulers Pratapdhvaj was a minister of Singhadhvaj when he usurped power. At his death, his cousin Dharmanarayan seized power. He was challenged by Pratapdhvaj's son Durlabhnarayan and they decided to settle. Durlabhnarayan assumed power Kamrup, Goalpara, Jalpaiguri, Koch Bihar, along with the capital Kamatapur, while Dharmanarayan retained Rangpur and Mymensingh. As part of the settlement in about 1330, Durlabhnarayan received from Dharmanarayan the custody of fourteen families of Brahmans and Kayasthas, one among whom was Candivara, the great-great-grandfather of Sankardev. The court poets of Durlabhnarayan (Hema Saraswati and Harivara Vipra) and Indranarayan produced literary works that are considered to be the first examples of Early Assamese. * Pratapdhvaj (1305‚Äì1325) * Dharma Narayan (1325‚Äì1330) * Durlabh Narayan (1330‚Äì1350) * Indra Narayan (1350‚Äì1365) Baro-Bhuyan rule The invasion of Assam by Sikandar Shah (1357‚Äì1390) weakened Indranarayan. Though Shah had to retreat from central Assam because of an attack on Bengal by Firuz Shah Tughlaq, Indranarayana was sufficiently damaged that a Bhuyan from Darrang, Arimatta, was able to usurp power.\\"Indranarayan's inability to resist the Muslims paved the way for the rise of the Bhuyans. Indeed, one of them, Arimatta or Sasanka became so ambitious that he killed Indranarayan and usurped the throne of Kamata.\\" * Sasanka (Arimatta) (1365‚Äì1385) * Gajanka (1385‚Äì1400) * Sukranka (1400‚Äì1415) * Mriganka (1415‚Äì1440) Khen dynasty The Khen dynasty replaced the weak rulers of Kamata kingdom following Arimatta in the middle of the 15th century. Niladhvaj Khen, the first king, united several Baro-Bhuyan chieftains of the area and removed the last of Arimatta's successors‚ÄîMriganka.There were only three Khen rulers. * Niladhwaj (1440‚Äì1460) * Chakradhwaj (1460‚Äì1480) * Nilambar (1480‚Äì1498) The last king, Nilambar expanded the kingdom to include the present Koch Bihar districts of West Bengal and the undivided Kamrup and Darrang districts of Assam and northern Mymensing in Bangladesh as well as eastern parts of Dinajpur district,[2] though he was removed by Alauddin Husain Shah in 1498. Bengal Sultanate rule Alauddin Hussain Shah (c1494-1519), an Afghan ruler of Gauda, removed the last Khen ruler in 1498.The dates and duration of this invasion are not well established. See . According to tradition, this involved an instigation by a minister of Kamatapur whose son had a liaison with the Kamatapur queen, and Hussein Shah invaded the Kamata kingdom with 24,000 infantry, cavalry and a war flotilla. After a long seize of the Kamatapur fort and a treacherous win, Hussein Shah finally destroyed the city and annexed the region up to Hajo, thereby regaining much of the land Bengal had lost earlier to Kamatapur, and some more. Hussein Shah's son was made the viceroy of the region. Hussein Shah removed the local chieftains and established military control over the region. He issued coins in his name \\"conqueror of Kamru, Kamata\\". His conquest expanded the kingdom to central Assam. Hussein Shah finally lost military and political control to revolts by local chieftains including the Bara Bhuyans first and later to the Ahom king, Suhungmung, and the region lapsed into local control and rise of the Koch dynasty. Nevertheless, the Afghan rule had lasting effects. Hussein Shah's coins continued to be used till 1518, when the Koch dynasty began consolidating their rule. Ghiasuddin Aulia, a Muslim divine figure from Mecca, established a colony at Hajo. His tomb, which is said to contain a little soil from Mecca, now called \\"Poa Mecca\\" (\\"a quarter Mecca\\"), is frequented by Hindus and Muslims alike. Interregnum Alauddin Hussain Shah's representative in Kamata, his son Danial and his officers, was seized and killed by the Bara Bhuyans of the region and the region lapsed into their confederated style of governance. Koch kingdom * Vishwa Singha (1515‚Äì1540) * Nara Narayan (1540‚Äì1587) The Kamata kingdom then passed into the hands of the Koch people, with Vishwa Singha consolidating his control over one Bara-Bhuyan after another and establishing the Koch dynasty. In the 16th century Raghudev, the son of Chilarai and the nephew of Nara Narayan affected a split in the kingdom‚ÄîKoch Bihar and Koch Hajo. The two parts remained separated, the boundary between them forming roughly the administrative boundary between the present-day Assam and West Bengal. Koch Hajo, the eastern kingdom, soon came under attack from the Mughal, and the region went back and forth for between the Mughal and the Ahoms, finally settling with the Ahoms. Koch Bihar, the western kingdom, first befriended the Mughals and then the British, and the rulers maintained the princely state till the end of the British rule.

Soran Emirate () was a medieval Kurdish emirate established before the conquest of Kurdistan by Ottoman Empire in 1514 and later revived by Emir Kor centered in Rawandiz from 1816 to 1836. Kor was ousted in an offensive by the Ottomans. Early years While no date has been established for the origin of the Soran Emirate, Kurdish historian Sharaf al- Din Bitlisi mentions the Emirate in Sharafnama in 1597 as established by a shepherd by the name of Isa. Bitlisi claims that villagers quickly followed the popular Isa and they attacked the Rewan Castle where they established themselves. They took the name Soran meaning from red after the red stones near the castle.Year later, during the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514 between the Ottomans and the Safavids, the Emirate was able to conquer land between Erbil and Kirkuk. In 1534, Emir Ezaddin Sher was executed by Suleiman the Magnificent for his treatment of the Emperor's servants and the Emirate was given to Yazidis led by Hussein Beg who ruled as a brutal tyran. He was soon toppled by the family of the previous Emir led by Emir Saifaddin who himself was executed by the Emperor in Constantinople, pushing the Emirate into anarchy. Under Emir Kor As the region experienced a power vacuum due to the decline of the Baban Principality, the Russian-Turkish war from 1828 to 1829 and the Egyptian‚ÄìOttoman War from 1831 to 1833, Emir Muhammad Kor led a tribal force to Rawandiz and built a citadel in the town as they build up a military. Kor also cultivated close relations with the Ulama and quickly advanced taking over the towns of Zakho, Dohuk and Amedi of the Bahdinan Emirate in 1833 and thereby crushing its western neighbor. Kor oppressed Yazidis in the newly-conquered areas. The Emir subsequently attacked Bohtan and rapidly captured its capital Cizre, but was forced to retreat due to an uprising in Amedi. Fearing a cooperation between the Soran Emirate and Muhammad Ali of Egypt, the Ottomans dispatched an army to Soran in 1834, but was ultimately repelled by the tribes of Soran. A second Ottoman offensive was initiated in 1836 which forced Kor to retreat to Rawandiz, mainly due to the lack of support from his tribal allies. After having pressured to surrender by the situation given, Emir Kor travelled to Istanbul for negotiations, where he was given authority over the area of the Emirate of Soran. But on his way home he disappeared in the Black Sea area and the Ottoman Empire supported his brother Rasul as the Emir of the Emirate. The Emirate would ultimately fall victim to the growing centralization of the Ottoman Empire. Kurdish awareness There were traits of Kurdish awareness by the Soran Emirate including the desire to unite all Kurdish areas under one rule and the use of Kurdish uniforms for his army. On this, Emir Kor's brother Rasul told British writer and traveller Frederick Milingen: Moreover, researcher Ghalib writes: Notes Bibliography  * See also *List of Kurdish dynasties and countries Category:1836 disestablishments in Asia Category:Former Kurdish states in Iraq Category:Kurdish dynasties Category:Former emirates Category:History of the Kurdish people Category:Yazidis in Iraq ","title":"Soran Emirate"},{"id":"4252195","text":"The three-stage-to-orbit launch system is a commonly used rocket system to attain Earth orbit.

The eastern side of Blackhill, nearer to Provanmill and Riddrie, was designated Intermediate, a grade up from Rehousing, and housing was of the cottage flat-type with front and rear gardens and a measure of landscaping in the streets (\\"Rehousing\\" areas cost ¬£250 per house to build, while \\"Intermediate\\" areas cost ¬£1000).

There was (and is) a strong sense of neighbourliness, partly encouraged by the enclosed nature of the site, due to industry, railways and main roads cutting it off from other districts. It was, however, built close to a gasworks (Provan Gas Works) and a distillery, which did not add to the health of the area and, perhaps for this reason, it gained a reputation for being \\"difficult to let\\". Nearby is a prison, HM Prison Barlinnie, which may also have encouraged negative evaluations of the area. The area was comprehensively redeveloped in the early 21st century, with all of its tenement stock demolished and replaced with modest semi-detached houses.

An updated film adaptation of Empty World is currently in development with German production company Lago Film and the Los Angeles production company Cherry Road Films. Plot 15-year-old Neil Miller is orphaned following a car accident and goes to live with his grandparents in Winchelsea, England. Neil suffers post traumatic stress from the car accident and stays detached from his peers despite their occasional attempts to involve him. News travels of a new disease, called the Calcutta Plague due to its origin, which accelerates the aging process in human beings. The plague appears to be uniformly fatal, and although initially only affects those of already advanced years (claiming an old teacher at his school and both his grandparents), it quickly progresses until it takes the life of a 2-year-old girl (Susie) who Neil finds and attempts to look after. During this time Neil notes that he has contracted the plague, but after a brief fever it leaves him unaffected. The death of the girl (and earlier her 6-year-old brother, Tommy) leaves Neil the sole survivor of Winchelsea, and after deciding that Winchelsea is becoming dangerous - due in part to packs of wild dogs - he leaves for London, taking first a manual Mini which he has difficulty driving, followed by an automatic Jaguar. Arriving in London he meets his first fellow survivor - the mentally unbalanced Clive, who although friendly towards Neil, during the night vandalizes his car to the point of destroying it, steals his mother's ring that Neil had kept which was the only memory of his mother he had visibly, and then abandons him in central London. After finding the body of another survivor, Peter, who had committed suicide only hours before Neil found him, he is again despondent, but finds evidence of other survivors which brings him into contact with Billie and Lucy. Billie is openly hostile towards Neil, and it is implied that she has suffered in some way either during the plague or directly after it, but Neil becomes friends with Lucy and starts a romantic relationship with her - much to Billie's disgust. During this time Neil notes that the dogs have been supplanted by even more dangerous rats, and at least one big cat has escaped from a local zoo and although unseen is heard outside their flat. To this end Neil arms himself with a pistol and ammunition taken from a sporting goods shop. Billie and Neil continue to argue over an unspecified period of time, with Lucy gradually taking Neil's side in arguments, until eventually during a foraging expedition Billie attempts to kill Neil by stabbing him in the back with a kitchen knife. The attack is shown to be premeditated as when Neil tries to defend himself with the gun he finds that it has been unloaded. Neil is injured, but overpowers Billie and returns to Lucy, where they lock Billie out and decide to move on to a previously discussed farmhouse. Billie arrives back at the house and pleads with both Lucy and Neil to let her back in, but they decide that they could never trust her again, and leave her outside. In the last paragraph of the book Neil abruptly changes his mind, feeling that he would never get over the guilt of leaving Billie to die, and with Lucy goes downstairs to open the door and let her back inside.

In 1923, it came out from under the auspices of the athletic association and became governed by the Student Publications Union Board, which at the time was in charge of all campus publications. Students paid a fee of $5.50 to fund the publications. Publication increased to three days in 1925 and published the first summer edition in 1927. The student body voted in favor of increasing funding to the DTH in 1929 in a vote of 666 to 128. The vote enabled the paper, then led by editor Walter Spearman, to publish six times a week.Campus newspaper continues to evolve, DTH Media. Retrieved 2011-02-03. The paper changed its name to The Daily Tar Heel. In 1943, the paper scaled back publication to twice weekly. In 1946, The Daily Tar Heel returned to daily publication with the goal of becoming, in the words of student editors, \\"the greatest college newspaper in the world.\\" The famous broadcaster Charles Kuralt, who was DTH editor in 1954, wrote in his book A Life on the Road of being called \\"a pawn of the Communists\\" on the floor of the state legislature after the newspaper published a spoof edition critical of Sen. Joseph McCarthy. The student legislature formed a committee in 1955 to \\"investigate quality and circulation problems at the DTH.\\" Independence In the 1970s and 1980s, student editors used the paper's front-page quote to agitate many on campus; selections included Nietzsche's \\"God is dead.\\" The paper's use of student fees was called into question in July 1972, when four students filed suit against the paper.Tar Heel Link, UNC Libraries, Retrieved 2011-02-03. The students objected to the use of student fees used to publish articles they did not agree with. The DTH collected donations to pay for its legal defense, and ultimately won an assurance of at least 16 percent of all student fees in 1977. An independent publishing board was also established, though the paper's budget remained tied to the Student Congress for yearly approval. In 1989, the DTH incorporated as a separate educational 501(c)(3) non-profit entity. The paper voluntarily stopped taking student fee money in 1993, making it completely financially independent from the University for the first time. That allowed the DTH to begin its current process of allowing an 11-member committee of staffers and community members to select the next editor. Previously, the position had been filled in campuswide elections. Peter Wallsten was the last DTH editor selected by campuswide elections. Recent years The 2010-2017 DTH office. On November 19, 1994, the DTH became one of the first newspapers of any kind to publish an online edition.

On September 2016, The Daily Tar Heel filed the lawsuit against UNC to obtain access to public records concerning the identification of students or employees who have committed rape or sexual assault. The lawsuit was on behalf of itself, the Capital Broadcasting Company, the Charlotte Observer Publishing Company and The Durham Herald Company. On May 3, 2017, Judge Allen Baddour, a Superior Court Judge in Wake and Orange County, ruled that UNC is not required to provide those public records. He stated that Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and the State Human Resources Act protects students and employees, respectively. The DTH has a long-standing bet with editors of The Chronicle, Duke University's student newspaper.

The losing school's paper must also place the winning school's logo on their editorial page and declare the winning school is \\"still the best\\" on the front page.Carolina-Duke rivalry In conjuncture with the Daily Tar Heel financial struggles, in February 2018 the newsroom was moved from the large Rosemary Street office to a smaller, more consolidated space at 210 E. Franklin Street in Suite 210. Though the move has strong ties to the fiscal state of The Daily Tar Heel, their newer office is closer to UNC's central campus, and is in the midst of action on Franklin Street.  Financial struggle  Since 2011, The Daily Tar Heel has been losing money. In recent years, the 124-year-old newspaper has had an annual deficit of about $200,000. Betsy Donovan, general manager of The Daily Tar Heel, cited changes in the industry, specifically the decline in print advertising, for the organization's financial situation. In a Medium essay in August 2016, she wrote that the Tar Heel has two years to \\"figure out its finances.\\" To create more revenue, Donovan launched The 1893 Brand Studio, an in-house agency for services and creative consulting, in 2017. The Tar Heel has also cut the number of days in print to three. In March 2017, Donovan said the University of North Carolina's 2017 men's basketball national championship reduced the Tar Heels deficit from about $100,000 to less than $50,000 for the fiscal year. The organization's annual revenue at the time was just under $900,000 per year. Accolades and awards The DTH has been recognized as one of the best college newspapers in the country.

Since leaving North Korea, she has resided in South Korea. Imprisonment Lee was a manager in a North Korean government office that distributed goods and materials to the country's people when she was falsely accused of dishonesty in her job. She believes she was one of the victims of a power struggle between the Workers' Party and the public security bureau police. Following her arrest, she was severely tortured and threatened for months but maintained her innocence. However, a promise made by an interrogator to not take any punitive action against her husband and son if she confessed‚Äîa promise that she would find out to have been false‚Äîfinally convinced her to plead guilty to the charges. For six years, Lee was imprisoned in Kaechon concentration camp where she reported witnessing forced abortions, infanticide, instances of rape, public executions, testing of biological weapons on prisoners (see human experimentation in North Korea), extreme malnutrition, and other forms of inhumane conditions and depravity. It is not clear why she was released, although Lee suspects that the officials responsible for jailing her were the subjects of investigations by higher- ranking members of North Korea's government. Defection Following her release, Lee wrote several letters of protest to North Korean leader Kim Jong- il about her cruel treatment in the camp but never received a response and was eventually threatened with unspecified consequences if she wrote any more letters. She managed to reunite with her son and escape from North Korea soon afterward, converting to Christianity along the way. Her husband disappeared during her imprisonment and she has not heard from him since. Since escaping with her son via China to South Korea in 1995, Lee has written Eyes of the Tailless Animals: Prison Memoirs of a North Korean Woman, a memoir of her six- year imprisonment on false charges in Kaechon concentration camp. She has testified before the US Congress and spoken at churches worldwide; she estimated that in her camp alone there were at least 6,000 political prisoners. Ms. Lee has been partially disabled due to the physical torture she was subjected to for well over a year, including but not limited to water torture. Along with fellow North Korean prison camp internees Kang Chol-Hwan and An Hyuk (both were in Yodok concentration camp), she received the Democracy Award from the American non-profit organization National Endowment for Democracy in July 2003.
