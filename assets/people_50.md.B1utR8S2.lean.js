Grand Central Terminal is on the center and left. Murray Hill Hotel, the Belmont Hotel, a never-built replacement for the Hotel Manhattan, the Biltmore Hotel, Grand Central Terminal, and the Hotel Commodore Pershing Square is a public square in Manhattan, New York City, located where Park Avenue and 42nd Street intersect in front of Grand Central Terminal. The main roadway of Park Avenue crosses over 42nd Street on the Park Avenue Viaduct, also known as the Pershing Square Viaduct. Two service roads, one northbound and one southbound, connect 42nd Street with the main roadway of Park Avenue, at 40th Street. Pershing Square was named after John J. Pershing in 1919. The name was originally supposed to apply to the block bounded by Park Avenue, Lexington Avenue, 41st Street, and 42nd Street. Three buildings were ultimately developed on the block in the 1920s: the Pershing Square Building, 110 East 42nd Street, and the Chanin Building. Subsequently, the name applied to the service roads of the Park Avenue Viaduct. A tourist information center under the viaduct, at Pershing Square, was built in 1939; it was later reconfigured to be a store and then a restaurant. The service roads between 42nd and 41st Streets were converted into a pedestrian public plaza in 2018.  Development  The square is named after General John J. Pershing, and was originally intended to be an open plaza in Pershing's honor occupying the entire block between 41st Street, Park Avenue, 42nd Street, and Lexington Avenue. Until 1885, Steuben Street‚Äînamed for Revolutionary War general Baron von Steuben‚Äîran diagonally across the block. The Grand Union Hotel was built on the northwestern corner of the block in 1883. The eastern part of the block contained the Manhattan Storage Warehouse, which was built in 1882. The hotel was condemned via eminent domain in 1914, and it was subsequently demolished to make way for the construction of the New York City Subway's Grand Central‚Äì42nd Street station, which ran diagonally below the site. Shortly after the opening of the Park Avenue Viaduct in 1919, the area at the bottom of the viaduct was renamed for Pershing. The former Grand Union Hotel space was proposed for use as an open plaza with a three-story memorial called \\"Victory Hall\\". The idea of a victory hall was opposed by Fiorello H. La Guardia, president of the New York City Board of Aldermen. The Transit Commission attempted to sell the building site in May 1920 for $2.8 million (equal to $ million in ), but no one placed a bid. In July 1920, a realty consortium headed by investor Henry Mandel bought the Grand Union site. Mandel gave the Bowery Savings Bank the center part of the Pershing Square block, which would be developed into an office building at 110 East 42nd Street, completed in 1923. The western part of the site became the Pershing Square Building, also completed in 1923. The eastern part, which contained the storage warehouse, was redeveloped into the Chanin Building, which opened in 1929. The \\"Pershing Square\\" name subsequently applied to the service roads of the Park Avenue Viaduct between 40th and 42nd streets.  Viaduct space and closure to traffic  The space under the viaduct between 41st and 42nd streets was originally used as a trolley barn. In 1938, the city announced that it would build a tourist information center within that space in advance of the 1939 New York World's Fair. The city subsequently built a steel and glass-brick structure under the center arch of the viaduct. The structure, located at 90 East 42nd Street, opened in December 1939 and was initially used to provide tourist information. During World War II, the space was used by United Service Organizations, and after the war, became an outpost of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau. The building had become an unemployment office by the 1980s. In 1989, the Grand Central Partnership proposed to turn the space under the viaduct, at the time a discount store, into a restaurant. Pershing Square would also be closed to traffic between 41st and 42nd streets. At the time, the space was occupied by discount retailer North Pole Stores, which relocated elsewhere in March 1992. The Grand Central Partnership decided to go forward with the restaurant-conversion project in 1993. However, the project had experienced difficulties because Manhattan Community Board 5 was opposed to the partnership's plan to close the adjacent block of Park Avenue, and the city had requested that the project undergo a lengthy zoning procedure called the Uniform Land-Use Review Procedure. The community board opposed the closure because, between Seventh Avenue and Second Avenue, the only opportunity for eastbound traffic on 42nd Street to make a right turn was at Park Avenue. In 1995, the city and the Grand Central Partnership unveiled plans to restore the space at a cost of $2 million, then lease it as a restaurant. The Pershing Square Cafe signed a lease at the space in 1997. The owner of the renovated space, Michael O'Keeffe, placed so much attention to the renovation of the space that the project's costs increased to $5 million, and the cafe's opening date was pushed back by several months. The details in the cafe included slot-headed screws, the only ones available when the viaduct was built; chairs and electric cords imported from Paris, and a hand-rubbed paint scheme. The entrance of the cafe was placed at 42nd Street, while the kitchen was located near the 41st Street section of the viaduct. The service roads between 41st and 42nd streets remained open to traffic until 2018 when they were converted into a pedestrian public plaza.

Niles (born 1945) is an American scholar of medieval English literature best known for his work on Beowulf and the theory of oral literature. Career A graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, where he received his higher degrees (B.A. in English, 1967; PhD in Comparative Literature, 1972), Niles taught for an initial four years as Assistant Professor of English at Brandeis University. He then was invited to join the faculty of the Department of English at the University of California, Berkeley, where he remained for twenty-six years until taking early retirement. In 2001 he joined the faculty of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where he taught for ten years in the Department of English, was named the Frederic G. Cassidy Professor of Humanities, and was a Senior Fellow at the UW Institute for the Humanities. After his retirement from UW- Madison in 2011 he has remained active in research as Professor Emeritus at both UC Berkeley and UW-Madison. Niles is the author of eight books on Old English literature and related topics. He has edited or co-edited another nine books, in addition to upwards of sixty scholarly articles and other publications. During the 1980s he conducted extensive fieldwork into singing and storytelling traditions in Scotland, particularly among Scottish Gypsy and Traveller Groups, including the noted storyteller Duncan Williamson. This research resulted in his 1997 book Homo Narrans: The Poetics and Anthropology of Oral Literature. In 2005 he taught a seminar at the Newberry Library, Chicago on the early history of Old English studies. This became the kernel of his 2015 book The Idea of Anglo- Saxon England 1066-1901, a sustained account of the history of Anglo-Saxon studies. His researches into the archaeology and prehistory of early Northwest Europe led to the joint publication Beowulf and Lejre (2007). This features a mine of information about the prehistoric Danish site (at the present-day hamlet of Lejre, Zealand) where much of the imagined action of Beowulf is set. His 2019 book God‚Äôs Exiles and English Verse: On the Exeter Anthology of Old English Poetry is the first integrative book-length critical study of the earliest anthology of English-language poetry, a late-tenth-century collection that includes such poems as The Wanderer and The Seafarer.

Sanchez is the first contestant from Nevada to be crowned Miss USA. She represented the United States in the Miss Universe 2014 competition on January 25, 2015, and placed 1st runner-up. Early life Nia Sanchez was born in Sacramento, California on February 15, 1990, to David Sanchez, a military veteran born in a military base in Germany, and mother Nicole Sanford, who was born in a military base in Iran. Her paternal grandfather, Wilbur Sanchez, is Mexican and her paternal grandmother is German, while her mother is of Spanish, and other European mixture. Her parents divorced when she was 6 and she briefly lived in a women's shelter with her mother. When she was eight she and her brother (David, Jr.), moved to Menifee, California with their father, and she went on to graduate from Paloma Valley High School in 2008. Pageants Her first beauty pageant was the Miss San Jacinto Valley, which she entered when she was 13; at 19, she won Miss Citrus Valley USA, which qualified her to take part in the Miss Am√©rica Latina competition in Ecuador. =Miss California USA= Sanchez first competed in the Miss California USA 2010 pageant (as Miss Citrus Valley USA) and was second runner-up out of 133 contestants, losing to eventual titleholder Nicole Johnson. Sanchez has also competed in and won Miss Riverside County USA 2011 and Miss Hollywood USA 2012, both of which resulted in unsuccessful Miss California USA bids. =Miss Nevada USA= As Miss South Las Vegas USA, Sanchez was crowned as Miss Nevada USA by Chelsea Caswell on January 12, 2014, at Artemus W. Ham Concert Hall at University of Nevada, Las Vegas, winning the title on her first attempt. =Miss USA 2014= Sanchez represented Nevada at Miss USA 2014 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and was crowned as the winner by outgoing titleholder Erin Brady of Connecticut on June 8, 2014, beating 2nd runner-up Tiana Griggs of Georgia and 1st runner-up Audra Mari of North Dakota. During the final question portion of the competition, she was asked by judge Rumer Willis about the high rate of sexual assault among undergraduate women to which she responded that it is important to be able to defend yourself. She was the first Miss Nevada USA contestant to win Miss USA and the fourth Hispanic to win Miss USA after Laura Harring in 1985, Lynnette Cole in 2000, and Susie Castillo in 2003. This was the first time since Miss USA 2007 that the contest had not been held in Nevada. Controversy After winning Miss USA, a carpetbagger controversy arose regarding her claimed Nevada residence. After failing to win Miss California USA in 2010, 2011 and 2012, Sanchez reportedly created a paper trail to establish her eligibility to compete in Miss Nevada USA. Supposedly Sanchez had worked at Disneyland until November 2013 and had become Miss Nevada USA in January 2014, although competition rules state that Miss Nevada USA eligibility requires six months residency in the state as evidenced by two documents from \\"voter ID or registration card, tax return, school records, employment documents, telephone bill, utility bill, bank statement, credit card statement or lease/deed.\\" Sanchez is reported to have spoken with Miss Nevada USA pageant director Shanna Moakler to determine the minimum eligibility requirements. Sanchez is represented by AC Talent Agency, which has Las Vegas and Los Angeles offices, but is listed as based in Los Angeles. Sanchez has stated that she owns a home in Las Vegas and listed herself as based in Los Angeles as a marketing ploy due to the types of opportunities available in Los Angeles relative to those available in Las Vegas. =Miss Universe 2014= Sanchez represented the United States at Miss Universe 2014 which was held January 25, 2015, at the U.S. Century Bank Arena on the site of the Florida International University in Doral, Miami, Florida and finished as 1st runner-up to Paulina Vega of Colombia. Sanchez's first- runner up placement on Miss Universe is the highest achievement of the United States since Olivia Culpo won Miss Universe 2012. Personal life Sanchez is a fifth-degree black belt in taekwondo, which she began practicing when she was 8 years old. She was the first Miss USA ever featured on the cover of Tae Kwon Do Times Magazine. She also studied jazz and ballet for five years. At age 17, she visited Kenya, and after her high school graduation she spent time working as a nanny in Europe. She had visited 12 countries around the world before becoming Miss Nevada USA. She spends three months of the year serving on a mission in Mexico. She acted in the roles of various Disney princess characters at Hong Kong Disneyland where she worked for seven months in 2012. Sanchez began dating actor Daniel Booko before she won Miss Nevada USA. Booko proposed to Sanchez on a private terrace in New York City in October 2014. The couple married on October 17, 2015, in Temecula, California.

History =Separation= Sometime, probably during the 12th century the Chontal Maya in the westernmost part of The League of Mayapan separated from the rest of the league. They did this because they objected to an alliance with Mayapan,(the city not the league). They adopted the same governmental system that existed when they were attached to the league and Mayapan. That is, with the three existing classes. Nobility and priesthood, tax and slaves. It was in the west of their new country on the river Tabasco where they founded their capital city. Its name was Potonch√°n which means smelly place, there were 25,000 homes there. Having their main city on a wide river near the ocean allowed them to have an extensive sea trade network. =Acalan= At some point the eastern part of Tabasco became independent. The new countries name was Acalan which had its capitol at Itzamkanac. Acalan had constant disputes with Tabasco. Also Itzamkanac was inland and Acalan had a much smaller sea trade industry. =War with Xicalango= On Tris Island, now called Isla del Carmen the people were not Maya but Nahua. They had their own country and port city, both called Xicalango. Tabasco claimed the island, and there was constant violence on the border. Finally in 1513 Tabscoob, the last ruler of Tabasco led an army of 20,000 soldiers to Xicalango, where they defeated the islanders. It was a Maya custom to give the Halach Uinik a large number of slaves from the destroyed country. One of the slaves from Xicalango was Malintzin. A Statue of Tabscoob European contact =The visit of Juan de Grijalva= The first Spanish expedition to land in Tabasco was led by Juan de Grijalva, who on June 8, 1518, traversed in what is now the state of Tabasco. Grijalva arrived that day at the mouth of a great river, which the crew named \\"Grijalva\\" in honor of their captain. Juan de Grijalva went up the river to discover the inland area, and found four canoes full of Tabascans, painted and making gesticulations and gestures of war. But Grijalva sent the Mayas Juli√°n and Melchorejo who were kidnapped from Ekab, so that they could explain to the Tabascans in the Chontal language that they came in peace. Thus they continued along the river and, after less than a league, stumbled upon the large city of Potonch√°n. Grijalva and Tabscoob > We started eight days in June 1518 and going armed to the coast, about six > miles away from land, we saw a very large stream of water coming out of a > major river, the fresh water was spewing approximately six miles out to sea. > And with that current we could not enter by said river, which we named the > Grijalva River. We were being followed by more than two thousand Indians and > they were making signs of war (...) This river flows from very high > mountains, and this land seems to be the best upon which the sun shines; if > it were to be more settled, it would serve well as a capital: it is called > the Potonch√°n province. ‚ÄîJuan D√≠az, Itinerary of Grijalva (1518) Once ashore, Juan de Grijalva, with the help of Maya interpreters that he had taken earlier, began to strike up a friendly dialog. In addition to flattering the natives with gifts, Grijalva begged them to call their boss to meet and hold talks with him. And so, after a while, the Halach Uinik Tabscoob appeared with his nobles to greet Grijalva. During the talk, both figures exchanged gifts. Tabscoob gave Grijalva, Tabscoob gold armor in the shape of a leaf and a feather headdress. Grijalva gave the Maya ruler his green velvet doublet. Hern√°n Cort√©s =First contact= on March 12, 1519, the Spanish conquistador Hern√°n Cort√©s arrived at the mouth of the Grijalva river. He decided to have his ships drop anchor and enter the river in skiffs, in search of the great city of Potonch√°n described by Juan de Grijalva. Cort√©s landed right at the mouth of the river, at a place named \\"Punta de los Palmares.\\" > On the twelfth day of the month of March of the year one-thousand five- > hundred nineteen, we arrived with all the fleet at the Rio de Grijalva, > which is also called Tabasco(...) and from the smaller vessels and boats all > the soldiers were landed at the Cape of the Palms(as they were in Grijalva's > time) which was about half a league distant from the town of Tabasco. The > river, the river banks and the mangrove thickets were swarming with Indians > (...) in addition to this there were assembled in the town more than twelve > thousand warriors all prepared to make war on us... ‚ÄîBernal D√≠az del Castillo, Historia Verdadera de la Conquista de la Nueva Espa√±a (1519) To discover their intentions, Cort√©s, used a translator, to tell some Tabascans that were in a boat that \\"he would do no harm, to those who came in peace and that he only wanted to speak with them.\\" But Cort√©s, seeing that the natives were still threatening, ordered weapons brought on the boats and handed them to archers and musketeers, and he began planning how to attack the city. =The first battle= The next day Cort√©s sent Alonso de √Åvila with one hundred soldiers out on the road leading to the City, while Cort√©s and the other group of soldiers went in the boats. There, on the shore, Cort√©s made a requisition for them disembark. The natives refused, telling the Spaniards that, if they disembarked, they would be killed. They began to shoot arrows at Cort√©s' soldiers, initiating combat. > ... and they surrounded us with their canoes with such a spray of arrows > that they made us stop with water up to our waists, and there was so much > mud that we could not get out and many Indians charged us with spears and > others pierced us with arrows, ensuring that we did not touch land as soon > as we would have liked, and with so much mud we couldn't even move, and > Cort√©s was fighting and he lost a shoe in the mud and came to land with one > bare foot(...) and we were upon them on land crying to St. James and we made > them retreat to a wall that was made of timber, until we breached it and > came in to fight with them(...) we forced them through a road and there they > turned to fight face-to-face and they fought very valiantly.... ‚ÄîBernal D√≠az del Castillo, Historia Verdadera de la Conquista de population la Nueva Espa√±a (1519) Alonso de √Åvila arrived to the combat developing within Potonch√°n with his hundred men who went traveled by land, making the Tabascans flee and take refuge in the mountains. In this way, Cort√©s took possession of the great main plaza of Potonch√°n, in which there were rooms, great halls, and which had three houses of idols. > ...we came upon a great courtyard, which had some chambers and great halls, > and had three houses of idols. In the \\"c√∫es\\" [temples] of that court, which > Cort√©s ordered that we would repair (...) and there Cort√©s took possession > of the land, for his Majesty and in his royal name, in the following manner: > His sword drawn, he dealt three stabs to a large ceiba tree in a sign of > possession. The tree was in the square of that great town and he said that > if there were one person that contradicted him, he would defend it with his > sword and all those that were present said it was okay to take the land > (...) And before a notary of the king that decree was made... ‚ÄîBernal D√≠az del Castillo, Historia Verdadera de la Conquista de la Nueva Espa√±a (1519) =Battle of Centla= Hernan attacking Potonchan The next day, Captain Cort√©s sent Pedro de Alvarado with a hundred soldiers so that he could go six miles inland, and he sent Francisco de Lugo, with another hundred soldiers, to a different part. Francisco de Lugo ran into warrior squads, starting a new battle. Upon hearing the shots and drums, Alvarado went in aid of Lugo, and together, after a long fight, they were able to make the natives flee. The Spaniards returned to town to inform Cort√©s. The next day, early in the morning, Cort√©s and his men went through plains to Cintla or Centla. There they found thousands of Tabascan soldiers, beginning Battle of Centla. The Spaniards were attacked by the Tabascans. The Spaniards defended themselves with firearms like muskets and cannons. But what scared them much more was seeing the Spaniards riding horses. There were no horses in the Americas before the Spaniards came. The Tabascans believed that both rider and horse were one. In the end the Tabascans lost.

A few years later he traveled to Japan with his father who opened an Italian restaurant in Chiba in 1984. About those early years Salvatore told the press that it wasn't a good starting experience: \\"I didn‚Äôt like Japan at all, so after one year, I went back to Italy and spent 2‚Äì3 years studying at a culinary school.

The ensemble featured works by Crivici himself as well as commissioning and performing works by some of Australia‚Äôs best known composers. His personal connection to the Australian landscape has inspired many of his works including his recent Flat Earth for string quartet, didjeridu and percussion (2015), Landscape for string quartet (1999), Journey to a Mythical Place for string quartet (1993). His collaboration with indigenous artists has allowed him to create scores which \\"sensitively incorporate Indigenous elements\\", giving voice to a unique and evolving Australian style. Crivici has also been commissioned by many organisations and ensembles including the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Arafura Ensemble, 10 Days on the Island Festival, Sydney Film Festival, Fresh Ballet Company, Sydney Dance Company, One Extra Dance Company and Pacific Arts Festival. At the height of Elektra‚Äôs performance trajectory he completed a Masters in Performance (Conducting) as well as a Diploma of Social Science (Anthropology) both at the University of Sydney. Reflecting the larger scale of the works he now creates, Crivici has expanded Elektra String Quartet to a much larger ensemble Elektra Collectiv, which, now comprised both classical and jazz performers, he directs from the keyboard.

Its 2015 concert series at Venue 505 in Sydney, won the Sydney Fringe Festival Genre Excellence Award for Best Musical Performance with its performance of Crivici's Gregorian Funk. The present line-up of musicians are drawn from the ranks of Sydney's professional players - Andrew Haveron (concert master of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra) and Romano Crivici on violin, Robert Harris, viola and Adrian Wallis (Sydney Symphony Orchestra) playing cello. Sydney-based, Elektra came into being in 1990 in response to its members strongly felt need to go beyond the conventional limits, images and accepted boundaries of the traditional string quartet. Performing both nationally and internationally Elektra received critical acclaim as a ground breaking, exciting and always accessible voice in the Australian contemporary music scene. Crivici says - \\"Looking back, it is almost strange to remember the excitement and uniqueness of being in a position to explore, and participate in the creation of new music, new techniques, sounds and technologies, both amongst ourselves, and in collaboration with other musicians and composers. As such, our performance philosophy consisted in balancing our experimental and improvisational musical explorations with solid core works in our programming\\" Members of the quartet have changed over the years: Mirka Rozmus, Jacob Plooj, Chris Latham, Romano Crivici on violin; Rudi Crivici on viola and Adrian Wallis, Marcus Hartstein, Peter Morrison, Emma Luxton, on cello.

The government of William Pitt, worried by the possibility that the French Revolution might spread to England, had begun suppressing works that espoused radical philosophies. Paine's work, which advocated the right of the people to overthrow their government, was duly targeted, with a writ for his arrest issued on 21 May. Paine fled to France in September since he had been elected a member of the National Convention in France. He was instead represented in absentia by Thomas Erskine, a noted lawyer and orator who was severely criticised by government supporters in the months leading up to the trial. At the trial, Archibald Macdonald, representing the prosecution, argued that Paine's work served only to inflame the populace and distribute radical ideas to those without the experience to understand them in context. Erskine's reply opened with a defence of the freedom of lawyers to represent whichever clients came to them, and it followed with an exposition of his views on the nature of the freedom of the press that argued that the publication of radical tracts served only to improve the government by highlighting its weaknesses and could not be seditious if published in good faith. Despite Erskine's speech later receiving a rapturous response, Paine was found guilty before Macdonald replied. The verdict was seen by the government as legitimising their repression of radicalism, and paved the way for the 1794 Treason Trials, in which Erskine played a prominent role. English satirist James Gillray ridicules Paine in Paris awaiting sentence of execution from three hanging judges.  Background  = French Revolution = After involving itself in the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War, France found itself financially ruined. Attempts to pass an economic plan to alleviate that in the Estates-General of 1789 led instead to the Third Estate forming the National Assembly. Succeeded, in turn, by the National Constituent Assembly and the Legislative Assembly, the various legislative bodies succeeded in rendering the monarchy constitutional, limited by democratic institutions. Attempts to remove the monarch entirely, although thwarted on 20 June 1792, led to the effective overthrow of Louis XVI on 10 August. On 21 October, France was formally declared a republic. Britain was initially sympathetic to the revolutionaries of France, but the sympathy dissolved with the execution of Louis XVI and was replaced by hostility and a growing schism within the Whigs. While the Foxite branch argued for the Revolution as a source of general liberty, the administration of William Pitt became increasingly repressive, fearing the spread of Jacobinism to the United Kingdom and the overthrow of the government. The split was reflected in the behaviour of the people. While some joined societies dedicated to parliamentary reform, others formed mobs under the banner of \\"Church and King\\" and attacked the homes of liberals and those who sympathised with the French Revolution, including that of Joseph Priestley. The Association for Preserving Liberty and Property against Republicans and Levellers was formed and served as \\"an organised body of private agents engaged in ferreting out sedition wherever it raised its inky head\\". = Paine and the Rights of Man = Thomas Paine was a noted writer and political theorist whose work had influenced and helped drive the American Revolution. Having returned to England, he decided to write a book, Rights of Man, addressing the arguments of Edmund Burke, a prominent conservative strongly fearful of the French Revolution. The first part was published in 1791 and attracted no attention from Pitt's administration. The second, published on 16 February 1792, advocated, amongst other things, the right of the people to replace their government if they thought it appropriate. The work was an immediate success, selling a million- and-a-half copies,, generated public support for various reform movements. It also brought Paine to the attention of the government and made him a subject to its crackdown. While Paine was visiting an aunt in Kent, Pitt had a writ issued against J.S. Jordan, Paine's publisher, prosecuting him for seditious libel, a crime based on the concept that the executive was beyond reproach, which made it illegal to criticise the government. Paine returned to London and began to campaign for Jordan, finding him a lawyer and agreeing to pay his legal fees. Jordan, however, most likely frightened for his life, pleaded guilty and turned his files over to the court. With that additional evidence, a writ was issued for Paine on 21 May, charging him with the same crime. His trial date was set for 8 June, and later rescheduled for 18 December. Paine left England before he could be tried since he had been elected a member of the National Convention in France, tasked with writing a new constitution. He departed England on 13 September, never to return, but he further infuriated the government remotely by republishing the Rights of Man and writing Letter Addressed to the Addressors of the Late Proclamation in which he defended his actions and beliefs against those who had chosen to side with the government. Paine was instead represented in absentia by Thomas Erskine, a famous lawyer and orator who served as Attorney General to the Prince of Wales. As the trial date approached, both Erskine and Paine were targeted by vicious personal attacks. Paine's writ was followed by hundreds of loyal addresses, many of which targeted him, the burning of an effigy in Exeter and the banning of the sale of any of his books in Chester. Pamphlets slandering him were widely published, and both Paine and Erskine had their personal lives dug into.  Trial  Thomas Erskine, who defended Paine. The trial was finally held on 18 December 1792 in front of the Court of King's Bench. Lord Kenyon presided, with Erskine representing the defence, and the government represented by Archibald Macdonald, John Scott and Spencer Perceval. Macdonald opened for the prosecution, expressing outrage at the publication of the Rights of Man and his concern that it would be made available to so many members of the public who were unfamiliar with political philosophy. He also read excerpts from a letter that Paine had written to him after his arrival in Paris, which contained \\"everything with which to inflame a jury\\". He then presented various witnesses, starting with Thomas Haynes, to testify that the works had indeed been published, and following with Thomas Chapman, who had printed the first part of the Rights of Man. Chapman testified that he had intended to print the second part until he came upon a passage that \\"appeared of a dangerous tendency\\" and that, after an argument with a drunken Paine, he then returned the book. Erskine offered no evidence, admitting that Paine had written both the Rights of Man and the letter to Macdonald and instead chose to begin speaking. He opened with a statement against those who had pressured him to refuse Paine's case and stated, in a \\"brilliant exposition of the principles involved\\", that: He then moved on to addressing the freedom of the press and the limits on it, arguing that freedom of speech was necessary to identify the flaws in the structure of the government and the constitution, even if the author was mistaken about the flaws. As long as a writer intended only to enlighten others, prohibiting their speech would serve only to undermine the government by harming the opportunities to improve it. While Macdonald had argued that the book was problematic because it was circulated amongst all classes of society, Erskine argued that this was not the test of whether the Rights of Man was seditious. Instead, the test was whether Paine had exclusively dealt with what he believed to be in the best interests of England, its government and its people. While Paine's opinions ran counter to the existing system of government, Erskine argued that \\"opinion is free and... conduct alone is amenable to the law\\". For a libel claim to succeed, the Libel Act 1792 required the prosecution to show the publication was motivated by malice. Since Paine had intended only to help mankind, and this was a pure motive, he could not be guilty. Despite the speech, the jury found Paine guilty before Macdonald replied to Erskine's argument.  Aftermath  Thomas Hardy's account of the trials, 1794 Treason Trials, which were prompted by the verdict in Paine's trial Although it failed to sway the jury, Erskine's speech was given a rapturous response. After he left the court, he was confronted by a mob that cheered him and shouted, \\"Damn Tom Paine, but Erskine for ever, and the Liberty of the Press; the King, the Constitution, and Erskine for ever\\". The crowd proceeded to unhitch the horses from his carriage and carry the carriage (with him inside) to his lodgings at Serjeant's Inn. Over 30 transcripts or reports of the trial were printed, all of which contained Erskine's speech, and many editions emphasised Erskine's name and the theme of his speech on the title pages, using it to sell copies. Other reactions were less positive; William Godwin wrote a letter to Erskine shortly after the trial arguing that his statement that individuals were free to publish works attacking or criticising the Constitution \\"had a considerable share in prosecuting the verdict of guilty\\". Paine himself found Erskine's speech and conduct during the trial disappointing, expecting him to do more to defend the principles in the Rights of Man than he had. Pitt's administration took the guilty verdict in Paine's trial as a sign that further prosecutions for sedition were possible and so began many. In the 17 months following the trial, 11 publishers of the Rights of Man were prosecuted, receiving prison sentences of up to four years. They acted as a prelude to the 1794 Treason Trials in which a dozen reformers were indicted for allegedly conspiring to bring about a revolution. Erskine played a prominent role in defending many of them, including Thomas Hardy, John Horne Tooke and John Thelwall, all three of whom were acquitted.

Graeme Gordon Innes AM (born 9 August 1955) is a lawyer, mediator and company director, and was Australia's Disability Discrimination Commissioner from December 2005 to July 2014. As a human rights advocate for the past 30 years he has played a role in many human rights and disability initiatives, including the drafting of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In 2013, Innes won a case against RailCorp, which was found to have discriminated against blind and visually impaired passengers. Innes was admitted as a Member of the Order of Australia in 1995 in recognition of his human rights work and his contribution to the rights of people with disability in Australia. Early life and education Innes was born in Sydney, Australia. The son of Alwyn and Dorothy Innes, he has an older sister and younger brother. Alwyn Innes had been a councillor on Ashfield Municipal Council. Due to congenital issues, Innes was born totally blind. His parents were shocked by the news of his disability but endeavoured to treat him in the same way as his siblings. Innes believes this approach benefitted him in life. At age four, Innes and his family moved to a residence in the grounds of the Masonic Hospital (now the Sydney Private Hospital ) in Ashfield, when Innes‚Äô father Alwyn was appointed its CEO. Innes grew up there. Innes attended the North Rocks School for Blind Children, run by the New South Wales Department of Education on a site owned by the Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children. He was made school captain in 1971 in early recognition of his leadership capacities. He was thereafter one of the first blind children integrated into the mainstream school system, attending Ashfield Boys High School for Years 11 and 12 in 1972‚Äì73. He was a prefect at this school, and a member of the 1972 debating team that won many competitions. He then undertook law studies at the University of Sydney, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1978, and gained the foundation for his later specialisation in social justice and human rights law.  Career  = Early career = After completing practical legal training at the College of Law in 1978, Innes applied for about 30 jobs, but many employers did not understand how a blind person could work as a lawyer. He gained a position as a clerical assistant with the NSW Public Service, and two years later became a legal officer at the Department of Consumer Affairs. He became a conciliator in 1983, first at the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board and then at the WA Equal Opportunity Commission. Innes worked for Qantas (1993‚Äì1995), initially managing its Disability Services Project, and then fulfilling the role of the company‚Äôs Equal Employment Opportunity Officer. He then moved to Westpac, where he was Manager of Disability Projects (1995‚Äì1997). He was a Hearing Commissioner with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (1994‚Äì2001). In this role, he heard the cases of Finney v Hills Grammar School, and Purvis v NSW Department of Education, which resulted in the landmark decisions that the schools in question had discriminated against a child on the basis of their disability (either refusing enrolment, or excluding the child) in breach of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. Innes then became the Deputy Disability Discrimination Commissioner at the Australian Human Rights Commission from 1999‚Äì2005. As a tribunal member, he maintained a high resolution rate of complaints using conciliation for tribunals including the NSW Administrative Decisions Tribunal (1996‚Äì2005); the NSW Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal (1996‚Äì2005); and the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. Throughout his early career, Innes held leadership positions in disability advocacy organisations. He was the first Chair of Disabled Peoples International (Australia) which became People with Disability Australia (1983‚Äì1987), and Chair of Royal Blind Society (1995‚Äì2004) and was the first Chair of Australia's national blindness agency, Vision Australia (2004‚Äì2005). He was the Chair of the Commonwealth Disability Advisory Council of Australia 1989‚Äì1993, which achieved passage by government of the Disability Discrimination Act in 1992, and which developed a plan to improve transport accessibility (which later became the Accessible Transport Standards ). He was also Deputy Chair of the Australian Disability Consultative Council This council was replaced by the National People with Disabilities and Carer Council, which has is now replaced with Disability and Carers Industry Advisory Council 1995‚Äì1996, and Chair of World Blind Union (Asia Pacific Region) 2002‚Äì2005. He has been a board member of the NSW Disability Discrimination Legal Centre; Life Without Barriers;, Livable Housing Australia and is a board member of disability employment service, Joblife Employment. = Later career = Innes was appointed Australia's Disability Discrimination Commissioner in December 2005. During that time, he also served as Australia's Human Rights Commissioner (2005‚Äì2009) and as Race Discrimination Commissioner (2009‚Äì2011). As Commissioner, Innes contributed to human rights reform initiatives. He participated in the drafting of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its ratification by Australia. He also played an instrumental role in the Same Sex: Same Entitlements enquiry, which resulted in the removal of discrimination across Australian federal law. Innes also contributed to the development of the National Disability Strategy and the Disability (Access to Premises ‚Äì buildings) Standards 2010, as well as to the establishment of Livable Housing Australia. In his role as Human Rights Commissioner, he undertook three annual inspections of Australia‚Äôs Immigration Detention facilities. As a human rights advocate, in his personal capacity as well as professionally, Innes has achieved a number of reforms for people with disability. In 2013 acting in a personal capacity, he won a case in the Federal Magistrates Court against RailCorp . (which delivers train services in NSW). The magistrate found RailCorp had discriminated against blind and visually impaired passengers by refusing to commit to a program of improving station announcements on Sydney trains so that passengers would know where to get off. Innes won the case and $10,000 damages, after RailCorp spent more than $400,000 on its unsuccessful defence. Also in 2013, Innes initiated an online petition calling on department store Myer to increase its employment of people with disability to 10 per cent of its workforce. This action was in response to a negative statement by Myer‚Äôs CEO about the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Innes‚Äô petition gained 35,000 signatures within a few days. Innes has been an active advocate for the implementation of cinema captioning and audio descriptions in Australia. He is known for his speeches, and his erudite opinion pieces published in mainstream Australian media. He embraces communications technologies and platforms, and is a regular user of Twitter for timely media commentary. = Notable achievements = * Passing of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 * Passing of the UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities * Passing of the UN Optional Protocol on Rights of Persons with Disabilities = Honours = Innes was made a Member of the Order of Australia 1995 for service to the community, particularly as an adviser on disability anti-discrimination policy.

With the departure of a vast array of players after the 1982-1983 season the club management decided to build a new team made up of youngsters tha came up through the club's youth department. ≈†vrakiƒá's skill helped the young team eventually win the Yugoslav First League in 1985, becoming the second FK Sarajevo outfit to do so. In 1987, he joined Turkish S√ºper Lig side Adana Demirspor whom he represented in the next two seasons, helping the team avoid relegation by scoring 42 goals in 86 matches. In the summer of 1989 he was acquired by Turkish powerhouse Galatasaray for a record 800,000 DEM, eventually going on to play for Ankarag√ºc√º and Kar≈üƒ±yaka, captaining the latter and thus becoming the second foreign-born captain in S√ºper Lig history. ≈†vrakiƒá spent two more seasons in the Maltese Premier League with Rabat Ajax before retiring in 1996 at the age of 36.  International career  He earned his first cap for Yugoslavia in 1983, coming on as a 70th-minute substitute in a friendly tie against West Germany, managing to find the back of the net on his debut. After being included in the Yugoslav Olympic national team roster for the 1984 Summer Olympics he had to withdraw after suffering a horrendous injury during a tour in Libya with FK Sarajevo. He earned three more caps for Yugoslavia.≈†vrakiƒá naslijedio dres sa brojem sedam od Safeta Su≈°iƒáa Between 1992 and 1994, during the Bosnian war, he represented Bosnia and Herzegovina internationally, even though the Bosnian FA was not officially recognized for most of his international tenure, and the team only contested humanitarian matches with the aim of garnering support and aid for the newly independent state.≈†vrakiƒá: Reprezentacija BiH je prvu utakmicu odigrala 1992. godine u Istanbulu  Managerial career  ≈†vrakiƒá began his managerial career as interim player-manager at Rabat Ajax in 1994, eventually taking over the team and managing it for a further seven seasons.

Most kuchkabal were run by a halach uinik, who ruled on behalf of one of the gods of their pantheon, constituting a theocracy. The succession occurred in the same family, with power passing from parent to child, under the law of primogeniture. The halach uinik concentrated all religious, military and civil power in one person. They chose officials from among the members of the theocracy who helped in the administration of the kuchkabal. They usually designated their family members as heads or batab of the batalib (municipalities) that formed the kuchkabal. These batabob commanded their own soldiers, presided over the local council, implemented justice, and controlled the payment of taxes. In addition to these assignments, they also took care of the fields at the times indicated by the priests or ah k'in. The halach uinic was lord of a Maya city-state.

Jan Baptist emigrated to Vienna where he remained active.Jean Baptiste de Bie at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Erasmus de Bie had pupils in 1660 and in 1666, of whom one was his son Frans. Work Erasmus de Bie is known for his lively city scenes and genre scenes and some landscape paintings. He is also mentioned as the creator of religious scenes and compositions with animals. He is also mentioned as the author of at least one winterscape and two seascapes. It is not clear whether the views of Italianate cities and landscapes attributed to him are the work of Adriaen de Bie, a Flemish painter from Lier who worked in Italy for some time.Adriaen de Bie (1593‚Äì1668), Campo Vaccino, Rome, Victoria Art Gallery, Art UKErasmus de Bie (1593‚Äì1668), Campo Vaccino, Rome, Victoria Art Gallery, at the National Inventory of Continental European paintings His surviving signatures are in capital letters: ED (in ligature) BIE. His main specialty was the composition of animated townscapes, in particular of city squares. His composition The Ommegang in Antwerp is an example of such a work. It was reinterpreted by various Flemish artists including Alexander van Bredael.Une procession anim√©e at Musƒóe de Flandre It may itself have been inspired by Pieter van Aelst's painting with the same theme.Peter van Aelst, The Ommegang on the Meir in Antwerp, at Jean Moust Another lively city scene of Antwerp is the Figures in front of the frozen Scheldt in Antwerp painted in 1670 (Artcurial sale of 13 November 2018 lot 43). It shows a winter landscape of the river Scheldt, seen from the Anwerp quays. The Scheld is frozen solid and several tents and pavilions selling all kinds of food have been constructed on the ice. Several inhabitants of Antwerp are seen playing on the icy river, enjoying banquets and engaging in other amusements during the winter of 1670. The artist depicts various amusing scenes such as a woman on the verge of falling out of a sleigh pulled by a horse, a man defecating on the ice who is being chased way and a couple of men engaged in a brawl. Fellow Antwerp artist Sebastiaen Vrancx (1573-1647) painted half a century earlier the Ice pleasure on the Scheldt in Antwerp (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam) showing a similar view of Antwerp's citizens having fun on the Scheldt.Erasmus de Bie Anvers, 1629 ‚Äì 1675, Sc√®ne de f√™te √† Anvers sur l‚ÄôEscaut gel√© at Artcurial Figures in front of the frozen Scheldt in Antwerp Erasmus de Bie was an accomplished painter of figures and often collaborated with other artists in Antwerp for whom he painted the staffage. This is documented in the papers of the Antwerp art dealers Forchondt, which mention two anonymous church interiors with figures painted by de Bie. He may have produced Italianate landscapes set among Roman buildings and populated with many figures and animals reminiscent of the style of the group of genre painters active in Rome known as the Bamboccianti. A painting of the Campo Vaccino in Rome showing a myriad of figures on the Forum Romanum in the collection of the Victoria Art Gallery (Bath, Somerset) is attributed to him on the museum's website and on the National Inventory of Continental European paintings.Erasmus de Bie, Campo Vaccino, Rome, on the Victoria Art Gallery site The National Inventory of Continental European paintings records that there is an inscription on the front lower left reading 'ED ¬∑ BIE - 1643', which is similar to Erasmus de Bie's known signature. However, it seems unlikely that a 14-year old who had not travelled outside Antwerp would have been able to paint a painting of this scale and scope. It is therefore possible that the painting was the work of Adriaen de Bie, a Flemish painter from Lier, Belgium who worked in Italy between 1614 and 1622. The work is attributed to Adriaen de Bie on the Art UK website and in various publications.As cited in the National Inventory of Continental European paintings record, the work is attributed to Adriaen de Bie in: Wright, C., Old Master Paintings in Britain: An Index of Continental Old Master Paintings executed before c.1800 in Public Collections in the United Kingdom, London, 1976, p. 17; Sloman, S., Victoria Art Gallery: Concise Catalogue of Paintings and Drawings, Bath, 1991, p. 10; J.

Ngerng moved to Taiwan in late 2016. Ngerng started his sociopolitical blog, The Heart Truths, in 2012. He was found liable in October 2014 of defaming Lee Hsien Loong, the Prime Minister of Singapore, in a blog post. Ngerng is also noted for his protests at Hong Lim Park campaigning against Singapore's Central Provident Fund. As a result of the events surrounding him, Ngerng was ranked by Yahoo Singapore as the top Singapore newsmaker of 2014. Early life Ngerng's father is a chai tow kway seller while his mother is a retired factory worker. Ngerng lived with them and his younger sister in a four-room Housing Development Board flat in Sembawang. Ngerng also has an elder sister. Before 2000, the Ngerng family lived in a two-room flat near the now-defunct Hong Dao Primary School, which Ngerng had attended. Ngerng's family were unaware of his blogging activities until the events of May 2014. Ngerng states that his interest in people and their interactions started in primary school when he witnessed instances of racism. At the age of 15, Ngerng revealed his homosexuality to friends, but described facing resultant discrimination. He went on to study in Serangoon Junior College, where he took art as an GCE Advanced Level subject and won an award for topping his level in geography and art in his first year. Ngerng majored in sociology at the National University of Singapore, where he participated in its community service club helping autistic or hyperactive children and people with mental disorders. Career After graduation, Ngerng worked for six months with Autism Partnership, an organisation working with families with autistic children. Ngerng then joined the Health Promotion Board‚Äôs Communicable Diseases department for six years, working on campaigns and presenting at international conferences, and winning an Employee of the Year award for innovation in 2011. In 2012, he joined Tan Tock Seng Hospital as a contract patient coordinator, where he fronted a campaign to promote the understanding of the lives of HIV-infected people. On 10 June 2014, Ngerng was sacked from his job at Tan Tock Seng Hospital for \\"conduct incompatible with the values and standards expected of employees\\" and for misusing resources for personal pursuits. Ngerng described the sacking as \\"politically motivated\\". NGO Maruah expressed concern on the manner of punishment and the reasons for doing so. In the same month, a 71-year-old man, Loh Thiam Hock, was jailed for four weeks for vandalising public property in support of Ngerng. =Political career= In August 2015, Ngerng was part of the Reform Party six-member team contesting Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency in the 2015 general election. The People's Action Party team headed by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong defeated the Reform Party 135,115 to 36,711 (78.63% to 21.37%) in the election. = Taiwan = Since October 2016, Ngerng has been residing in Taipei after he was terminated from his previous job. In 2018, Ngerng took part in an Al Jazeera documentary, Singapore: The House that Lee Built. The documentary is Ngerng's first media appearance since his participation in the 2015 Singapore general election and reveals a snippet of Ngerng's life in Taiwan. Controversies =Libel suit over CPF blog post (2015)= On 15 May 2014, Ngerng made a post entitled \\"Where Your CPF Money Is Going: Learning From The City Harvest Trial\\" on his blog the Heart Truths. Within the post, Ngerng created a chart which mapped the relationships between Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, the Central Provident Fund (CPF), the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Temasek Holdings and the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC). Ngerng claimed there was an \\"uncanny resemblance\\" between this chart and another chart by news agency Channel News Asia regarding the relationship among City Harvest Church leaders, who were being charged with misappropriating funds. The CPF has been described as \\"a forced savings scheme\\" for Singaporeans with \\"monthly contributions into the fund\\" to be saved for retirement, or for expenses on \\"property, healthcare, and their children's education\\", while the GIC has been described to have \\"indirectly invested\\" funds from the CPF. On 18 May, Lee's lawyer, Senior Counsel Davinder Singh of Drew & Napier, stated that the blog post alleged that Lee \\"is guilty of criminal misappropriation of the monies paid by Singaporeans to the CPF\\" and that the allegations were \\"false and baseless\\". It was demanded that Ngerng issue an apology and take down the blog post within three days, as well as pay damages and legal fees, failing which Ngerng could be sued for defamation. On 19 May, Ngerng took down the offending blog post. He had yet to apologise and said that the offending article was a call for greater transparency on the CPF, the GIC and Temasek Holdings. Meanwhile, he posted another blog post entitled \\"Your CPF: The Complete Truth And Nothing But The Truth\\". Around this time, Singapore human rights non-governmental organisation Maruah called for Lee to rebut the points made in Ngerng's blog post. After an extension for the deadline for Ngerng's written response was granted, Ngerng apologised \\"unreservedly\\" on 23 May, admitting that his allegation was \\"false and completely without foundation\\". Ngerng also asked that he not pay for damages and legal fees, while requesting an \\"open dialogue\\" with Lee on the CPF. Ngerng's appeal to drop damages and costs was rejected. On 26 May, Singh sent a letter to Ngerng, saying that four further blog posts by Ngerng and a 24 May YouTube video showed that Ngerng's apology was not \\"genuine\\". If Ngerng did not take down this material, aggravated damages would be claimed. Ngerng agreed to remove the additional posts and video. On 27 May, Ngerng offered S$5,000 in damages \\"with each party to bear their own costs\\", which was rejected by Singh as \\"derisory\\". Meanwhile, Singh said that Ngerng had once again \\"misled\\" Lee and the public by not removing his YouTube video as agreed upon, claimed that the video was merely made private, and alleged that Ngerng had sent two emails with links to the posts and video to \\"a far wider audience\\" including local and international media. In response, Ngerng's lawyer, M Ravi, claimed no knowledge of the emails. On 29 May 2014, Lee filed a defamation lawsuit against Ngerng. In response, Ngerng made an online plea for help in settling his legal fees through crowdfunding, leaving instructions on how to transfer money to his bank account. Within a week, Ngerng said that he had raised more than his targeted S$70,000. It was later reported that Ngerng had managed to raise more than S$110,000 from over a thousand contributions. While Lee did not address the case directly, he wrote on Facebook that \\"freedom of speech does not come free from the need to be responsible for what one says, either online or offline\\". Singaporean writer Catherine Lim has criticised the lawsuit against Ngerng. On 17 June, Ngerng's defence was filed in court by his lawyer, M Ravi, who stated that Ngerng had never intended to accuse Lee of criminal misappropriation of CPF funds. In July 2014, Lee applied for summary judgment for the case. In a 4 August affidavit, Ngerng argued that his blog post had been misunderstood, and that he was merely asking for more transparency and accountability for CPF monies. In August, it was also reported that Ngerng was working part-time at his father's chai tow kway stall. At a 19 September closed hearing, Lee's lawyers asserted that Ngerng had \\"no defence\\" and asked for an injunction, while Ngerng's lawyer, M Ravi, argued that the blog post was not defamatory if read in its entirety. On 7 November 2014, the High Court found Ngerng liable of defamation with damages to be assessed, which was the first such ruling in Singapore over a purely online article. The court ruled that there was \\"no triable defence\\" and \\"no doubt that it is defamatory to suggest that the plaintiff is guilty of criminal misappropriation\\". An injunction against Ngerng was granted, barring him from publishing future similar accusations regarding Lee and the CPF. Ngerng expressed disappointment at the verdict, but maintained that he would \\"still continue to speak up on the CPF and other issues that concern Singaporeans\\". On 12 January 2015, the High Court ordered Ngerng to pay Lee S$29,000 for costs of legal fees and related expenses; with damages yet to be settled. After missing the payment deadline twice, Ngerng paid on 6 February after a public spat with his lawyer, M Ravi. On 12 June 2015, Ngerng's application to be represented by a Queen's Counsel in the damages hearing scheduled for 1 to 3 July 2015 was denied by the High Court and he was ordered to pay costs of S$6,000 to Lee's lawyers from Drew & Napier. The damages hearing proceeded as scheduled from 1 to 3 July 2015 with Ngerng representing himself and Lee being represented by Singh. Citing a lack of funds, Ngerng represented himself after dismissing his third lawyer in this case - George Hwang of George Hwang LLC. Ngerng's first lawyer in the case, M Ravi, was suspended by the Law Society for mental health reasons.http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/law-society-issues- statement-explaining-lawyer-m-ravis-suspension. During a hearing, Ngerng broke down in tears while he was being cross-examined by Singh. The hearing prompted much comment from international press freedom advocacy groups and a legal opinion in favour of minimal damages against defendant from the International Commission of Jurists: \\"It is humbly submitted that a decision awarding a disproportionately high amount of damages to the plaintiff in this case would cast a chilling effect on freedom of expression in Singapore\\".http://icj.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp- content/uploads/2015/07/Singapore-RoyNgerng-Advocacy- LegalOpinion-2015-ENG-.pdf The High Court requested both parties to make written submissions on their respective cases by 31 August 2015. No date was given for the court's decision. On 17 December 2015, the court handed down a judgement ordering Ngerng to pay S$100,000 in general damages and S$50,000 in aggravated damages. Ngerng, through his lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam, proposed to pay the S$150,000 in instalments. Lee granted Ngerng his request on the condition that Ngerng paid the S$30,000 in hearing costs immediately, i.e., by 16 March 2016. Ngerng is expected to repay S$100 a month from 1 April 2016 onwards over five years until 1 April 2021 when instalments are increased to S$1,000 until the full sum has been paid by the year 2033. Lee also rejected Ngerng's request to reimburse part of the damages, i.e., S$36,000. =Failed NMP application= On 21 May 2014, Ngerng applied to be a Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP), with the proposal being submitted by fellow blogger Han Hui Hui. Ngerng was ultimately not selected as an NMP in August 2014. =Amos Yee= After Amos Yee was introduced to Ngerng's blog by Singapore Democratic Party members, Yee was convinced by Ngerng's arguments. This was one of the inspiring factors behind Yee publishing a controversial video in 2015 criticising Lee Kuan Yew and Christianity. Yee said that he used evidence from Ngerng's blog posts in the 2015 video. =Hong Lim Park protests= Ngerng was a speaker at the Return Our CPF protest organised by blogger Han Hui Hui at Hong Lim Park on 7 June 2014. In his speech, he demanded transparency and accountability for CPF monies. Organizers claimed a turnout of 6,000, while international news agencies reported about 2,000. Ngerng also spoke at the second (which drew \\"hundreds\\") and third Return Our CPF protests at the same venue on 12 July and 23 August 2014. A controversial incident occurred on 27 September 2014 when another Return Our CPF protest, again organised by Han Hui Hui, took place at Hong Lim Park at the same time as the YMCA Proms @ the Park event, a charity carnival attended by the elderly and disabled, featuring performances by children. Agence France-Presse described Ngerng and Han as having \\"led a march ... despite having only a permit to stage a rally at a fixed spot\\". The Straits Times described that Han had led the protesting group in \\"marching around the park\\" together with Ngerng, with the group \\"heckling special needs children and confronting\\" Minister of State Trade and Industry Teo Ser Luck, who attended the YMCA event. A few days later, Teo confirmed that Ngerng had issued an apology for the disruption; Teo himself apologised due to his \\"presence\\" causing the protesters to \\"go after\\" him. In a joint statement, the National Parks Board (NParks) and the Singapore Police Force (SPF) said that \\"each event was allocated a lawn\\" and that Han did not heed their advice \\"to speak at the allocated space\\". They described that \\"Han's group encroached into the YMCA event area, holding placards and shouting slogans, disrupted performances and frightened participants, including special needs children who were performing at the charity event\\". NParks and SPF also said that final approval to hold the event was given to YMCA on 9 September 2014, while Han's application for the protest was received and approved on 22 September 2014. The YMCA stated that NParks on 11 April 2014 had acknowledged their intent to hold the carnival. On 27 October 2014, in relation to the YMCA event disruption, Ngerng, Han, and four others were charged for public nuisance, which can incur a maximum fine of S$1,000; Ngerng and Han were also charged for organising a demonstration without approval, which can incur a maximum fine of S$5,000. In October 2015, Ngerng pleaded guilty to charges of public nuisance and organising a demonstration without approval. His lawyer, Eugene Thuraisingam, said he committed the offence because of ignorance. Ngerng was fined S$1,900. Personal life Ngerng attended the now-defunct Hong Dao Primary School for a few years then transferred to Ang Mo Kio Primary School. He later studied at Mayflower Secondary School and then Serangoon Junior College before going to the National University of Singapore to major in sociology. During his junior college and university years, he excelled and got the top grade in English literature, Geography and arts. He was also on the dean's list of his university for one semester. Raised in a family of five, Ngerng has an elder sister and a younger sister. His father is a hawker chef. During his early life, Ngerng and his family lived in Ang Mo Kio and later moved to Sembawang. Ngerng is gay, as stated in his personal blog, My Right To Love, in 2011. He has written on topics related to the LGBT community, such as relationship woes and AIDS. Ngerng's family has long accepted his homosexuality even though they did not react positively when first revealed of his sexual orientation decades ago; his mother initially cried and for a few years refused to acknowledge his homosexuality.

Commencement of His Career and Breakthrough Merkur was born in 1976 and began his business activities in the business sector at the age of 16, as a high-tech entrepreneur. He studied at the Ort Singalovski School in Computers and Electronics specialty class. Tsahi Merkur's breakthrough took place in the framework of his business activities on the Internet, and as a global pioneer in the field of an innovative business model entrepreneur. He was the first person in the world to incorporate commercial advertisements on the Internet, and did so even before Google and Facebook, which are leaders in the world today in the field of Internet advertising services . General Merkur is the owner of a large international group of companies, engaged in many fields of activity, including hi-tech, internet, real estate, retail, hotel, energy, advertising, bio-acoustics and electric transportation. in recent years, he has been promoting voluntary activity for people in need and ill children in Israel and around the world, and has established the National Centre for Charity and Aid for those in Need . In August 2018, Tsahi Merkur Enters into Partnership with the British Energy Giant Centrica . Real estate and parking lots In 1999, Merkur founded the parking company, the ‚ÄúParking Giant‚Äù, and later \\"Success parking\\", \\"Reit Parking\\" as well as other parking companies . In 2005, Success Parking became the largest car park company in Israel and it also began to operate public parking lots. In 2005, the company won a tender for the operation of the five largest parking lots in Tel Aviv of \\"Ahuzot HaHof\\", for the duration of two years . As of 2013, the number of parking lots and facilities owned and operated by \\" Success Parking\\" stands at approximately one hundred . In 2008, Merkur acquired from Yitzhak Tshuva, through Success Parking, a portfolio of nine parking facilities in the cities of Tel Aviv, Netanya, Petah Tikva and Jerusalem with 2,000 parking spaces for about 40 million NIS. Success Parking revenue for 2009 was more than $200 million. In 2010, Merkur attempted to acquire a controlling share of Azorim Investment, Development and Construction.. Merkur owns real estate businesses that are partly used for vehicles parking through the \\"Success Assets\\" company, which has five branches: \\" Success Parking Ltd.\\" (the largest parking lot franchise owned by him, which focuses mainly on parking lots in Tel Aviv), \\"Reit Parking Ltd.\\", Bareket Investments and Parking Ltd.\\", ‚ÄúBezeq Parking Ltd.\\" (for one parking lot) and \\"Neta Parking Ltd. \\" . In March 2018, Tsahi completed an impressive 400% profit when he managed to sell a parking facility in Netanya for about 24 million NIS, having bought it only a year earlier at 6.5 million NIS. This achievement by Tsahi, which has already made several ‚Äúexits‚Äù in the parking market, is added up to the impressive sales of parking facilities that Merkur sold in previous years. Among other things, he sold the portfolio he bought from Yitzhak Tshuva for NIS 40 million, as individual parking facilities at a total sales price of about 140 million NIS, at the timeline of approximately only 3 years. One of those parking facilities is the Shtamper parking facility in Netanya, which has 79 parking spaces, which Merkur managed to sell for NIS 13 Million, a sales price that reflects NIS 164,500 per parking space, which also broke a record in Israel for parking at a public parking facility. Today, Success Parking, as the largest parking company in Israel, serves about 80% of Israel's drivers, and the annual turnover of the parking group is estimated at more than $ 200 Million annually.  Investments in start-ups  = AppliCure = AppliCure is a company that develops, manufactures and markets software products for a network environment (Internet and intranet), and its flagship product is a software named dotDefender, which secures a variety of platforms and web-based applications. The company was founded in 2004 by Moshe Bassol (who served as CEO until 2010) and David Alush. In 2007, AppliCure was listed for trading on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, at a company value of NIS 42 million . The company raised NIS 11 Million on the stock exchange, but presented losses, and soon thereafter the company lost its worth. In the reports of the fourth quarter of 2007, it already became clear that the financing round was almost exhausted, and the company was required to raise additional capital. The British fund Trafalgar Capital supported the company, but however, AppliCure was unable to recover from its losses, and ended the first quarter of 2009 with a \\" Going Concern Warning‚Äù notice in its reports. In July 2009, the control interest in the company (70%) was sold to the Nika Group, which was under the control of Merkur, for NIS 8 million . In the first quarter of 2010, the Company had become profitable for the first time in its history. The Nika Group was established and managed by Tsahi Merkur (who was appointed Chairman of the AppliCure Board of Directors), Eli Hakam, and Fruition (formerly No Risk Ltd. 2004). The company currently operates a number of business models, including SaaS (Software as a Service) and the sale of licenses. The Company currently has approximately 1,500 subscribers and customers who have purchased licenses for the system, Dot-Defender. = DRiiVZ = In 2011, Tsahi Merkur founded the start-up DRiiVZ, which aims to manage charging stations for electric vehicles. The company has developed a platform for online cloud management and billing. In this framework it provides solutions and software for infrastructure and charging stations for hybrid and electric vehicles and also the management and streamlining of smart energy projects. In 2013, the management system of DRiiVZ was announced by the Dutch Elaad Fund as the world's leading management system, of all the systems examined by it. The E-laad Foundation has the largest public charging network in Europe and is the founder of the global consortium OCCP, which integrates private and public companies that are leading the field of charging infrastructure for electric cars. DRiiVZ has also developed an innovative online vehicle management platform called Vehicle-to-Grid, which enables network management of power transmission from electric vehicles to power grids, including technology that supports energy efficiency. Under this scope, DRiiVZ has integrated projects with leading energy companies in dozens of countries and is active throughout Europe, America and Australia. DRiiVZ, which is today a world leader in energy and electric transport, and currently serves hundreds of thousands of electric vehicle drivers worldwide, won the world competition in February 2018 and was recognized as the most innovative electric transport company in the world. The announcement came after DRiiVZ competed with 450 companies from 51 countries, surveyed by the Free Electron International Association, which integrates the largest energy companies in the world . According to Tsahi Merkur, who believes a breakthrough in the field of transportation will be created, among other things, by electric cars, by 2030 most of the cars sold in the world will be electric, including autonomous vehicles that travel independently without a driver. In August 2018, Tsahi Merkur has entered into a partnership with the British energy giant Centrica, which is traded and listed on the FTSE 100 on the London Stock Exchange and counts among its holdings British Gas, Scottish Power, Bord Gais Energy and many additional holdings, and has invested in Driivz, which Merkur still controls . Centrica is a multi-national British energy company that provides electricity, gas and various services to tens of millions of consumers. Centrica, through an investment arm that invests in technology companies, Centrica Innovation, has joined up with the London investment fund, Ombu Group, which specializes in investment in advanced technology companies, and together they led an investment round that raised $12 million in Driivz.  The National Centre for Charity and Aid for those in Need, and Voluntary Activities  Tsahi Merkur initiated and founded the National Centre for Charity and Aid for those in Need, which operates voluntarily and with the funding of Merkur. Its purpose is to increase the scope of donations for the people in need and for non-profit organizations in Israel, and to improve the transparency of the fundraising organizations in Israel. In addition, a charity fund which is operated entirely with Tsahi‚Äôs funding, was established in order to assist the struggling populations, especially sick children and homeless people. As part of the project, an innovative global donation system is being developed that will improve the level of transparency and the efficiency of charity organizations and foundations, and will enable the increase in the amount of donations that can be raised by non-profit organizations and charities, that manage to channel the donations to them in the best possible manner for the ultimate goal for which the donors initially intended to contribute, and also directly to those in need who will be able to reach the hearts of the donors .. Tsahi's system will enable donations of food and clothing, as well as donations to those in need, charities and charity foundations.  Better Place transaction  Better Place is an international operation of electric vehicles, that was conceived and stirred by Shai Agassi in Israel, until October 2012, and then was established by Agassi and Idan Ofer, chairman of the Israeli Corporation, In May 2013, after investing NIS 3 Billion. After failing to raise additional funds, Better Place requested the court to appoint a liquidator, and in July 2013 the court approved the recommendation of the temporary liquidators to sell the company's activity and assets in Israel to the Sunrise group for NIS 18 Million . and without payment of an advance payment. At the end of August 2013, the temporary liquidators appealed to the court to cancel the sale to the Sunrise group, and to sell the activity to Success Assets. However, this sale as well was cancelled at the request of the liquidators, out of a series of 4 consecutive sales transactions that were cancelled for four different buyers. Merkur appealed to the Supreme Court to cancel the decision to cancel the transaction, but until the appeal was heard in March 2014, the company's assets were already sold in parts, and there was no longer any reason to hear the appeal while the sale could not be re-established. The Supreme Court ruled that Merkur's Success Assets were entitled to compensation for the cancellation of the transaction.

When a rare and difficult to obtain medicine that requires daily doses to stave off the effects of a zombie infection runs low, a physician (Hampshire) and her infected husband (Holden- Ried) go on the run to avoid angry demonstrators. Plot In the 1980s, a zombie plague spreads worldwide and causes the deaths of an estimated 100 million people. An unprecedented amount of research goes into finding a cure, but the resulting medicine requires daily doses to be effective. If the infected miss even a single dose, they quickly and irrevocably degenerate to a feral zombie state. As the formula can only be extracted from dead feral zombies, there are constant rumors that the supplies will run out. Infected humans, called \\"the returned\\", are subject to discrimination and violence from bigoted and fearful uninfected humans. Kate, a physician who cares for the returned and fundraises to support research to develop a synthetic medicine, has been stocking up on black market doses of the treatment, fearful that it will run out soon. Her husband Alex, a music teacher, became infected when he attempted to assist a man who he thought was having a seizure. Alex comes out as returned to his best friend Jacob, who readily accepts him. When protestors become violent, and the government begins to set up quarantine camps, Jacob and his wife Amber invite Alex and Kate to stay with them outside the city. Alex narrowly avoids both an attempted murder and police searches. When Kate's source turns up dead, and evidence points toward Amber, Kate instructs Alex to check on their supply of the treatment. Alex finds a single dose and a note from Jacob that apologizes for taking the rest, as Amber has become infected. With only one day left to live as a human, Alex becomes desperate to find a new source. Kate returns to the city and reveals her dilemma to the hospital chief, who gives her the hospital's entire stash. However, the parent of an infected child attempts to steal the container, and in the ensuing fight over it, all the contents are destroyed. Distraught, Kate returns empty-handed and comforts Alex, who has chained himself to the wall. Alex slowly experiences the symptoms of the change and demands that Kate shoot him in the head. Kate, who had a traumatic experience in her past, when her mother became infected, is reluctant to oblige him, but she kills him off-screen once he turns. As Kate returns to the city to settle her affairs, the hospital chief excitedly tells her that researchers have created a synthesized treatment. Kate falls to her knees in grief. In the final scene, some months later, a pregnant Kate prepares to assassinate Jacob and Amber at a book tour.

Reception The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 58% of 19 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.8/10. Metacritic rated it 47/100 based nine reviews. Jonathan Holland of The Hollywood Reporter called it \\"a smart, politically correct upending of the zombie myth, focusing with mixed results on the human rather than on the horror.\\" Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"an admirable shake-up\\" that degenerates into predictable plot twists that lack suspense. Adam Nayman of The Globe and Mail rated it 2.5/4 stars and wrote, \\"The Returned doesn‚Äôt bring much new to the party, except maybe restraint.\\" Bruce Demara of The Toronto Star wrote that the film's execution does not live up to its potential. Rob Staeger of LA Weekly wrote, \\"The film suffers from a series of unsatisfying endings, but it's nonetheless refreshing to see a zombie movie with brains behind the camera instead of on the menu.\\" Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine rated it 1.5/4 stars and wrote, \\"The Returned proves that the zombie narrative is still capable of subversion, but does so with the laziest, Lifetime-grade intimations of social relevance.\\" Brad McHargue of Dread Central rated it 2.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"While The Returned is admirable in its attempts to inject social commentary and a unique twist into a stale subgenre, it's just so heavy-handed in attempts to drive the point home that it drowns out the pathos the film so desperately wants to have.\\" Patrick Cooper of Bloody Disgusting rated it 3.5/5 stars and called it \\"an interesting film bursting with ideas and subtle ways of addressing them.\\" Peter Martin of Twitch Film wrote that the themes are familiar but the \\"somber, thoughtful mood\\" makes up for it.

From 1942 until 1945 it housed an important World War II counterintelligence operation, designed to deceive Germany and Japan about Allied war plans. In 2018 New York's Historic Preservation Board nominated it to the National Register; it was listed later that year. History When an Argentinian Nazi spy defected to the American legation in Montevideo, Uruguay, early in World War II, the Federal Bureau of Investigation decided to create a cover operation to convince the Nazis that he and other spies were still working for Germany. The FBI took over Benson House and moved a special agent, Donworth Johnson, and his family into the house, with a cover story that Johnson suffered from tuberculosis and so needed quiet and fresh air. The illness would also explain his military deferment. Johnson's wife, Betty Ann, cooked meals for her husband and other agents who moved in and out under cover of night. They worked on the second and third stories of the house.Long Island Home's Secret Role in WWII Espionage Revealed, NBC New York, June 6, 2014. Accessed June 9, 2014 The main mission of the operation was to broadcast coded radio transmissions to the Germans in Hamburg, supposedly from the Nazi spies. These transmissions contained a mixture of true and false information. In 1943, counterintelligence designed to keep German troops in northwest Europe and away from the eastern and Italian fronts was transmitted. In 1944, information designed to confuse the Germans about D-Day plans was transmitted. False information about Allied plans to invade Formosa and the Kuril Islands in the Pacific was also sent, to be passed on to Japanese forces. Transmissions were also received. Intelligence about German interest in developing an atomic bomb, received in 1942, played a role in President Franklin Roosevelt's decision to develop an American bomb. In order to carry out the operation, several large shortwave radios were installed in the house. In order not to attract attention due to the large amount of electricity needed to run the radios and associated equipment, a Buick car engine was bolted to the floor of the basement to supply power. A muffler helped deaden the noise. Large antennas were required to be placed outside, but were hidden by trees, helped by the then isolated location of the house. Current use Until recently, very little has been written or publicly known about the building or the operation carried out there. Benson House was named in honor of Mary Benson, who donated funds to the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island to purchase the house after the war.Wading River retreat house was FBI disinformation operation in World War II, Newsday, May 31, 2014. Accessed June 9, 2014 After it was acquired by the Diocese in 1947, the house was renamed and began its new life as a part of the diocesan summer camp and retreat center, Camp DeWolfe. On June 7, 2014 - the day after the 70th anniversary of D-Day - the Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI and the diocese dedicated a plaque affixed to the house, which explains the building's significance.

He became involved in the theatrical community in Chicago, founding the Chicago Play Producing Company. His production of Georg Kaiser's Gas, which was presented at the Goodman Theatre on January 28, 1926, was particularly successful. In 1927 he began producing plays in New York City, and married actress Dorothy Libaire in 1930. Gering became a Hollywood film director for Paramount Pictures in 1931, directing Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard in I Take This Woman on his debut. In 1932 he directed Tallulah Bankhead, Gary Cooper, Charles Laughton, and a young Cary Grant in Devil and the Deep. He collaborated several times with producer Albert Lewis, producing films together like Ready for Love and later stage productions like The Walking Gentleman at the Playhouse Theatre. In 1935 he directed George Raft and Carole Lombard in the film Rumba, inspired by the success of Bolero the previous year, but it wasn't as successful. Gering's stint with Paramount came to an end in 1936, and he then joined Columbia Pictures between 1937 and 1939, and directed the 1937 British picture Thunder in the City for the Atlantic Film Company. His film career came to a halt by the end of the decade. He tried in the subsequent period, albeit in vain, to build on his previous accomplishments as a theatre producer and to pursue film directing in Europe. Between 1947 and 1949 he attempted to relaunch his film career in Cuba but with little success. In 1950 he briefly returned to film directing Michael Whalen, Doris Dowling and Tommy Wonder in the musical drama Sarumba. He later reportedly worked as a technical assistant and caretaker in colleges. He directed the sexploitation film Violated Paradise (1963).

A \\"share\\" is awarded to members of the mining pool who present a valid partial proof-of-work. Mining in pools began when the difficulty for mining increased to the point where it could take centuries for slower miners to generate a block. The solution to this problem was for miners to pool their resources so they could generate blocks more quickly and therefore receive a portion of the block reward on a consistent basis, rather than randomly once every few years.Ittay Eyal with Emin G√ºn Sirer:\\"Majority is not Enough: Bitcoin Mining is Vulnerable \\" in the 18th International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security(FC).2014, In the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (Oakland), 2015. History * Late 2010: Slush launched the first mining pool * 2011‚Äì2013: The era of deepbit, which at its peak, shares up to 45% of the network hashrate * 2013‚Äì2014: Since the introduction of ASIC, and when deepbit failed to support the newer stratum protocol, GHash.IO replaced deepbit and became the largest * 2014‚Äì2015: Rise of China. F2Pool which launched in May 2013, replaced GHash.IO and became then the largest mining pool * 2016‚Äì2018: Rise of Bitmain and its AntPool. Bitmain also controls a few other smaller pools like BTC.com and ViaBTC * 2019‚Äì2020: The launch of Poolin. Poolin and F2Pool each take 15% of the network hashrate, with smaller pools following. * 2020: Binance launches a mining pool following Huobi and OKex. Luxor launches a US-based mining pool. Mining pool share Share is the principal concept of the mining pool operation. Share is a potential block solution. So it may be a block solution, but it is not necessarily so. For example, suppose a block solution is a number that ends with 10 zeros and, a share may be a number with 5 zeros at the end. Sooner or later one of the shares will have not only 5, but 10 zeros at the end, and this will be the block solution. Mining pools need shares to estimate the miner‚Äôs contribution to the work performed by the pool to find a block. There are numerous miner reward systems: PPS, PROP, PPLNS, PPLNT, and many more. Mining pool methods Mining pools may contain hundreds or thousands of miners using specialized protocols. In all these schemes B stands for a block reward minus pool fee and p is a probability of finding a block in a share attempt (p = 1/D, where D is current block difficulty). A pool can support \\"variable share difficulty\\" feature, which means that a miner can select the share target (the lower bound of share difficulty) on his own and change p accordingly. =Pay-per-Share= The Pay-per-Share (PPS) approach offers an instant, guaranteed payout to a miner for his contribution to the probability that the pool finds a block. Miners are paid out from the pool's existing balance and can withdraw their payout immediately. This model allows for the least possible variance in payment for miners while also transferring much of the risk to the pool's operator. Each share costs exactly the expected value of each hash attempt R = B \\\\cdot p. =Proportional= Miners earn shares until the pool finds a block (the end of the mining round). After that each user gets reward R = B \\\\cdot \\\\frac{n}{N}, where n is amount of his own shares, and N is amount of all shares in this round. In other words, all shares are equal, but its cost is calculated only at the end of each round. =Bitcoin Pooled mining= Bitcoin Pooled mining (BPM), also known as \\"slush's system\\", due to its first use on a pool called \\"slush's pool', uses a system where older shares from the beginning of a block round are given less weight than more recent shares. A new round starts the moment the pool solves a block and miners are rewarded Proportional to the shares submitted. This reduces the ability to cheat the mining pool system by switching pools during a round, to maximize profit. =Pay-per-last-N-shares= Pay-per-last-N-shares (PPLNS) method is similar to Proportional, but the miner's reward is calculated on a basis of N last shares, instead of all shares for the last round. It means that when a block is found, the reward of each miner is calculated based on the miner contribution to the last N pool shares. Therefore, if the round was short enough all miners get more profit and vice versa. =Solo Mining Pool= Solo pools operate the same way as usual pools, with the only difference being that block reward is not distributed among all miners. The entire reward in a solo pool goes to the miner who finds the block. =Peer-to-Peer Mining Pool= Peer-to-peer mining pool (P2Pool) decentralizes the responsibilities of a pool server, removing the chance of the pool operator cheating or the server being a single point of failure. Miners work on a side blockchain called a share chain, mining at a lower difficulty at a rate of one share block per 30 seconds. Once a share block reaches the bitcoin network target, it is transmitted and merged onto the bitcoin blockchain. Miners are rewarded when this occurs proportional to the shares submitted prior to the target block. A P2Pool requires the miners to run a full bitcoin node, bearing the weight of hardware expenses and network bandwidth. =Geometric method= Geometric Method (GM) was invented by Meni Rosenfeld. It is based on the same \\"score\\" idea, as Slush's method: the score granted for every new share, relatively to already existing score and the score of future shares, is always the same, thus there is no advantage to mining early or late in the round. The method goes as follows: * Choose parameters f and c (fixed and variable fee). * At the start of every round, set s = 1. For every worker k, let S_k be the worker‚Äôs score for this round, and set S_k = 0. * Set r=1-p+\\\\frac{p}{c}, where p = 1/D. If the difficulty changes during the round, r needs to be updated. * When worker k submits a share, set S_k = S_k + spB, and then s = sr. * If the share is a valid block, end the round. For every worker k pay \\\\frac{(1-f)(r-1)S_k}{sp} =Double Geometric method= Generalized version of Geometric and PPLNS methods. It involves new parameter: o (\\"cross-round leakage\\"). When o = 0 this becomes the Geometric method. When o = 1 this becomes a variant of PPLNS, with exponential decay instead of a step function. * Choose parameters f, c, and o. * When the pool first starts running, initialize s = 1. For every worker k, let S_k be the worker‚Äôs score, and set S_k=0. * Set r = 1 + \\\\frac{1}{c}p(1 - c)(1 - o). If at any point the difficulty or the parameters change, r should be recalculated. * When worker k submits a share, set S_k = S_k + (1 - f)(1 - c)spB (where B is the block reward at the time it was submitted), and then s = sr. * If the share is a valid block, then also do the following for each worker k: Give him a payout of \\\\frac{1}{c_s}(1 - o)S_k, and then set S_k = S_k \\\\cdot o. Transaction Fees Usually, the blocks in the cryptocurrency network contain transcations. Transaction fees are paid to the miner (mining pool). Different mining pools could share these fees between their miners or not. Pay-per-last-N-shares (PPLNS), Pay-Per-Share Plus (PPS+) or Full Pay-Per-Share (FPPS) are the most fair methods where the payouts from the pool include not only the block subsidy but also the transaction fees. Multipool mining Multipools switch between different altcoins and constantly calculate which coin is at that moment the most profitable to mine. Two key factors are involved in the algorithm that calculates profitability, the block time, and the price on the exchanges. To avoid the need for many different wallets for all possible minable coins, multipools may automatically exchange the mined coin to a coin that is accepted in the mainstream (for example bitcoin). Using this method, because the most profitable coins are being mined and then sold for the intended coin, it is possible to receive more coins in the intended currency than by mining that currency alone. This method also increases demand on the intended coin, which has the side effect of increasing or stabilizing the value of the intended coin.

The Telegraph, 6 June 2014. Retrieved 9 June 2014. Early life McDonagh was born in Harpurhey, Manchester, England on St. Patrick's Day 17 March 1934, the eldest of four children in a family of Irish origins. Her mother instilled a strong perfectionist tendency into her children. McDonagh later said \\"[she] never praised us\\". She was educated at Loreto Convent, Moss Side, Manchester, followed by a spell at the University of Manchester. She also studied at the Sorbonne in Paris. She worked as a model in London and Paris in the late 1950s, on television and in print, and in the fashion houses of Jacques Helm and Maggy Rouff. Following her marriage to David Main in 1960, and the birth of her first two children, McDonagh opened boutiques in Horwich and Worsley, Lancashire. Canada McDonagh moved to Canada in 1966 after David got a job with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). She described it as \\"like landing in the dark ages\\", at least as far as fashion went. Styles were old fashioned, and materials were difficult to obtain due to poor domestic production and high import taxes. She opened her first shop, known as The Establishment, in Bloor Street in downtown Toronto and began designing clothes. She was particularly known for creating \\"glamorous garments showcasing innovation in textile techniques\\" and her glamorous evening wear found favour with the social elite of Toronto's fund-raising circuit. Her creations were worn by Cher and Ella Fitzgerald. She went on to open a factory, the product of which was known as the Re-Establishment range, and to sell her clothes across Canada and the United States, including in Bloomingdale's, Bonwit Teller and Henri Bendel in New York. Among the styles she was said to have introduced to North America were minidresses, maxi-coats, bell-bottoms and the jumpsuit. She was credited with bringing the Mod look to Canada. In 1966 she took the unknown model Twiggy, who exemplified the androgynous Mod style in women's fashion, to a meeting with the fashion editor of the Canadian newspaper The Star, but the editor did not believe that Twiggy was a model as she was too thin and had a haircut and beret typical in Canada of the mentally disabled. Before she was well known, Twiggy had modelled for McDonagh in England and helped out in the stockroom. In 1999 McDonagh co- founded the Fashion Design Council of Canada, the former owners and producers of Toronto Fashion Week. They honoured her with a lifetime achievement award in 2003.

In England, McDonagh designed costumes for Diana Rigg as Emma Peel in The Avengers for whom she created leatherwear and python-buckled coats which she called \\"a very sophisticated, slightly fanciful take on what was happening in the swinging London club scene of the time\\". In Canada, she saw herself as exporting the \\"English look\\" abroad. She was inspired by the styles of the 1930s and 40s. One design, which became widely known simply as \\"the red dress\\", won her The New York Times award for design excellence in 1982. She designed the coat worn by Governor General Micha√´lle Jean during Barack Obama's 2009 visit to Canada. The coat thereafter became known as the \\"Mrs Obama coat\\" and McDonagh received regular requests from customers wishing to buy it.Pat McDonagh Couture. Textile Museum of Canada, YouTube, 2014.

She said she had used the same basic shape in every one of her collections in one form or another. Throughout her career she never changed her personal style, claiming as a Pisces to be averse to change, and her black bob hairstyle eventually became part of her personal brand and even part of her company logo.Pat McDonagh, legendary Canadian designer on her life and legacy.

Personal life McDonagh married the television director David Main (then working for Granada Television) in 1960, but they eventually divorced. The couple had three children, Louisa, Dominic and Kate. A slightly eccentric character, McDonagh was sometimes seen about Toronto with a parrot perched on her shoulder. She was a friend of the homeless and prone to spontaneous acts of generosity.

Education Armes was educated at Whitley Abbey Comprehensive School in Coventry and the University of Bristol where he was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in 1983 and followed by a PhD in 1987 for research supervised by Brian Vincent. Career and research After a postdoctoral research at Los Alamos National Laboratory Armes became a lecturer at the University of Sussex in 1989 where he worked until 2004. He moved to Sheffield to become Professor of Polymer and Colloid Chemistry in 2004. he is a director of Farapack Polymers Limited, a corporate spin-off from the University of Sheffield. Armes group does research on polymer chemistry and colloid chemistry.Steven Armes Using polymerisation techniques such as reversible addition‚àífragmentation chain-transfer polymerization (RAFT) and atom-transfer radical-polymerization (ATRP) his laboratory synthesises a wide range of polymers. His research focuses on the synthesis and application of polymers ‚Äì long-chain molecules formed from many repeating units known as monomers. In particular, Steven's research group has developed new ways to make water-soluble or water-dispersible polymers based on methacrylic monomers. A powerful approach is to use polymerisation-induced self-assembly (PISA). For example, a water-insoluble polymer can be grown from one end of a water-soluble polymer in aqueous solution. The growing hydrophobic chain leads to in situ self-assembly, forming copolymer nanoparticles of tuneable size and shape. These nanoparticles have a wide range of potential applications, including as a long-term storage medium for stem cells, viscosity modifiers, novel microcapsules and nanoparticle lubricants. His other research interests include designing novel biocompatible copolymer gels and vesicles and developing microscopic nanocomposite particles, which have applications in paints and antireflective coatings. Steven also has a fruitful collaboration with space scientists based in the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States, for whom he designs synthetic mimics to aid our understanding the behaviour of micrometeorites travelling at hypervelocities in outer space. Armes has developed robust new synthetic routes to controlled-structure water- soluble polymers. He optimised the living radical polymerisation of hydrophilic methacrylates, discovered a new class of 'schizophrenic' diblock copolymers whose amphiphilicity can be switched on or off, and has designed a range of novel biocompatible block copolymer gels and vesicles. His work on water-borne polymer colloids has led to novel shell cross-linked micelles and nanocomposite particles, with applications in paints, anti-reflective coatings and as stimulus-responsive Pickering emulsifiers. =Awards and honours= Armes was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2014. One or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text from the royalsociety.org website where: More recently, he has pioneered polymerisation-induced self-assembly to produce a range of bespoke spherical, worm-like and vesicular nano-objects via RAFT dispersion polymerisation. Armes was awarded the Tilden Prize by the Royal Society of Chemistry.

He was a member of the South Australian Football Hall of Fame. Early life Oatey, the son of South Australian football great Jack Oatey, captained the first eighteen at Norwood Boy's High School winning the Hone Medal for Fairest and Best in the High School competition in 1959 and 1960. In 1960 Robert was invited to join the Norwood thirds (U19) for 4 games as a Reserve after playing for his school. He then played in the SANFL second semi and Grand Final which Norwood won by defeating North Adelaide FC 13 goals to one with Robert winning the prize of $10 as best player on the ground. SANFL career A rover, Oatey kicked a goal with his first kick in league football for Norwood, in the 1961 season. He was amongst Norwood's best players in the loss to West Adelaide in the 1961 SANFL Grand Final. Oatey won Norwood's best and fairest award for the first time in 1967 and was also the club's leading goalkicker. The following season he began a six-year tenure as Norwood's captain-coach, during which time he played his best football. He was runner up to Barrie Robran in the 1968 Magarey Medal count, in his first year as coach, a season when Norwood finished last on the ladder. He won another club best and fairest that year, then again in 1971 and 1972. Under Oatey, Norwood improved to fifth in 1970 and were fourth in both 1972 and 1973, but he would be replaced as coach by former North Adelaide player Bob Hammond in 1974. From 1974 to 1978, Oatey played for Sturt, which were coached by his father. He was a Sturt premiership player in 1974, when the club defeated Glenelg in the grand final. His nine interstate appearances for South Australia includes games at the 1966 Hobart and 1969 Adelaide Carnivals. While at Norwood, Oatey played with his brother Peter, who also played tennis at the Australian Championships in the 1960s. Following his retirement from playing, Robert Oatey became a television commentator for SANFL games, working with Adelaide's Channel 7 and Channel 9 alongside others such as Bruce McAvaney, Ian Day, Peter Marker, Rick Keegan and Graham Campbell. Honours In 2000, Oatey was named as a forward pocket in Norwood's Team of the Century. Oatey was an inaugural inductee into the South Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2002. He received the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) in 2008, for his \\"service to Australian Rules football as a coach and as a contributor to the development of younger players.\\" References Category:Australian rules footballers from South Australia Category:Norwood Football Club players Category:Norwood Football Club coaches Category:Sturt Football Club players Category:Recipients of the Medal of the Order of Australia Category:South Australian Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:1942 births Category:2019 deaths ","title":"Robert Oatey"},{"id":"43007127","text":"Minibidion punctipenne is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

It gained visibility around the year 2010, arising from predecessors including \\"ELSA\\" (Ethical, Legal and Social Aspects) studies prompted by the Human Genome Project. Various slightly different definitions of RRI emerged, but all of them agree that societal challenges should be a primary focus of scientific research, and moreover they agree upon the methods by which that goal should be achieved. RRI involves holding research to high ethical standards, ensuring gender equality in the scientific community, investing policy-makers with the responsibility to avoid harmful effects of innovation, engaging the communities affected by innovation and ensuring that they have the knowledge necessary to understand the implications by furthering science education and Open Access. Organizations that adopted the RRI terminology include the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, the latter of which incorporated the language of RRI into their pre-existing program for funding \\"Societally Responsible Innovating\\". \\"Horizon 2020\\", the European Commission's program for science funding announced in 2013, made RRI a main focus. In 2014, it was suggested that the \\"broader impacts\\" criteria of the National Science Foundation were, despite certain dissimilarities, in effect coming to resemble RRI standards. One area in which RRI principles are being applied is quantum computing. A research collaboration led by Oxford University within the UK National Quantum Technologies Programme aims to reveal how quantum computing can be socially and economically transformative, and to identify the potential downsides of the \\"disruption\\" it might bring about. Among the criticisms voiced about RRI, prominent concerns include the vagueness of the terminology, the possibility of discouraging blue skies research and the lack of sufficient practical reward for embracing RRI in a research culture based on competition and short-term contracts.

It stars Sylvia Sidney, Mary Astor, and Edward Arnold. The film is based on the 1911 novel Jennie Gerhardt by Theodore Dreiser. Cast *Sylvia Sidney as Jennie Gerhardt *Donald Cook as Lester Kane *Mary Astor as Letty Pace *Edward Arnold as Sen. Brander *H.B. Warner as William Gerhardt Reception The film received a mixed critical reception upon release in June 1933. Motion Picture Herald said that Jennie Gerhardt is \\"strictly an adult picture. Selling it successfully depends upon your ability to construct campaigns that will intrigue human interest and sympathy in the character of Jennie.\\" He added that despite its large cast, much of the action was centred about Sylvia Sidney. Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times stated that \\"although the film is handicapped by a lack of suspense and some choppy and trite dialogue, it possesses a laudable sincerity, which may result in its being popular with those who are partial to this genre of story.\\" He further said: \\"Actually the producers have succeeded in putting into the picture a wealth of detail and the pity is that it is done without the necessary suspense. It is like a story told in a monotone, with vacillating characters who are a little too much at the beck and call of the director. The incidents, while not implausible, do not possess sufficient spontaneity. Keith Newlin, author of A Theodore Dreiser Encyclopedia, described it as an \\"episodic picture (broken into a number of short scenes)\\" and considered it to be more like the novel than most other Dreiser film adaptations. However, he believed that Gering had inexplicably \\"inserted several jarring scenes apparently in an attempt to provide the audience with some comic relief.\\" Dreiser himself approved of the film, considering it to be \\"moving\\" and \\"beautifully interpreted\\".

The foundation was most probably laid during the 11th century, while the lower part was built (in Romanesque style) from the 12th century, and the upper part (Gothic style) from the 13th century. The tower was once part of the former Szent D√∂m√∂t√∂r templom (St. Demetrius church), but today it stands in D√≥m Square, in front of the much larger Votive Church of Szeged. The upper part was rebuilt from the original stones in 1926. The architecture of the tower is similar to another found in Southern France, or in the territory of the former Byzantine Empire. Features On the upper part, there are 48 pointed windows in three levels (sixteen on each level, two on every side of the octagonal levels). On the lower part, a gate was cut and turned to a baptismal chapel in 1931. Above the gate there is a replica of the oldest sculpture in Szeged, the \\"K≈ëb√°r√°ny\\" (stone lamb), an agnus dei (Lamb of God) representation from the early 12th century. The replica replaced the original sculpture in 1991. Inside the tower, there is a fresco by Vilmos Aba-Nov√°k of the baptism of Hungarians in the 11th century. Due to the mould growing on the rear wall, the baptismal chapel is no longer in use. =Gate of Life= The tower's \\"Gate of Life\\" was made by J√°nos Bille in 1931 and explains a Christian life through symbols. At the top and at the bottom, there are two numbers: 1272 and 1931. The former was thought to represent the year in which the upper part was built, while 1931 is when it was turned to a baptismal chapel. There are 20 symbols, not including the numbers, the first one an Alpha and the last an Omega. The Alpha and the Omega were symbols of Jesus Christ, and birth and death.

Salem (1908) A picture painted in 1908 by Devonshire artist and architect, Sidney Curnow Vosper, (b. 29 October 1866) shows details of the internals of the chapel. The picture itself was purchased a year later by Lord Leverhulme of Lever Brothers fame in 1909. Leverhulme used it for the purposes of marketing Sunlight soap. For every 7 lbs of soap bought, the buyer qualified for a print of the Salem picture. As a result, it became one of the most widely distributed pictures in the UK. Many people believe that the face of the devil may be seen in the shawl worn by Si√¢n Owen. The original picture now hangs in the Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight.

From 1958-60 the Spanish Army reorganized along \\"Pentomic\\" five-component division lines. In 1965 a reorganization was undertaken that divided Spanish Army forces into Immediate Intervention (Field Army) and Operational Territorial Defence (Territorial Army) formations, adopting a structure of divisions broken down into brigades. However from 1984 a modernization plan was underway aimed at improving the deployability of the army and updating its equipment. The Modernizaci√≥n del Ej√©rcito de Tierra (META) plan, as it was called, only achieved its objectives partially, yet the army was reorganized. Notes: # Infantry regiments maintain a traditional and ceremonial identity, but are not an operational level of command. Operational command goes from brigades directly to infantry battalions, bypassing the regimental level. # Armoured units in the Spanish Army are designated \\"Armoured Infantry Battalions\\" and are considered part of the infantry regiments.

There were some precedents like a couple of albums (Rock encounter and The Soul of Flamenco and the Essence of Rock) by Sabicas, a handful of singles by Smash, Gong, Galaxia, Flamenco or even the American band Carmen. However, Triana was recognized as a pioneer of the genre since their music focuses on a homogeneous fusion of the progressive rock and flamenco. Many bands that mixed progressive and symphonic rock with flamenco followed them such as Im√°n Califato independiente, Cai, Guadalquivir, Alameda or Mezquita; that's why the term Andalusian rock may be understood simply as flamenco prog. Medina Azahara turned from progressive to a hard rock outfit in the 1980s and they remain as one of the most popular flamenco rock bands in its home nation. Also other flamenco-influenced styles of rock emerged like the flamenco-folk band Veneno, flamenco-jazz-blues band Pata Negra among other bands that melted flamenco with African, reggae or Latin rhythms.

Portugal Rei de Armas or Rei de Armas Portugal (Portuguese for \\"Portugal King of Arms\\") was the title of the main officer of arms of the Kingdom of Portugal. The office was established by King John I of Portugal, with its first holder being an Englishman named Harriet. The office was restructured in the scope of the new law that reformed the Portuguese heraldry, decreed by King Manuel I in 1512. The office was abolished when the Portuguese Monarchy was replaced by the Republic in 1910. Besides the principal Portugal Rei de Armas, there were two deputy kings of arms, the Rei de Armas Algarve (Algarve King of Arms) and the Rei de Armas √çndia (India King of Arms). The titles of the kings of arms were taken from the three main parts of the dominions of the Crown of Portugal, that were then the Kingdom of Portugal, the Kingdom of Algarve and the Portuguese State of India. In 1807, the Rei de Armas √çndia was retitled Rei de Armas Am√©rica, √Åfrica e √çndia (America, Africa and India King of Arms), returning to the original title after the independence of Brazil, recognized by Portugal in 1825. The kings of arms were assisted by three heralds (Arauto Lisboa, Arauto Silves and Arauto Goa) and by three pursuivants (Passavante Santar√©m, Passavante Lagos and Passavante Cochim). The titles of the heralds and pursuivants were taken from main cities and towns of Portugal (Lisbon and Santar√©m), the Algarve (Silves and Lagos) and the Portuguese India (Goa and Kochi).

He is particularly well known for his musical collaboration on the Tourist and Boulevard albums of St. Germain.  Biography  Son of the French actor and director Thierry Destrez, Alexandre grew up in the western suburbs of Paris. He became interested in music at the age of nine, teaching himself to play on his mother's old piano and continuing to be self-taught for several years. Following a \\"self-directed\\" scolarity, Destrez decided to concentrate entirely on his music to the exclusion of everything else. He left home and for several years earned his living by doing casual jobs while still focusing on the piano. At the age of 20, he began studying at the American School of Modern Music to deepen his knowledge of harmony, composition and arrangement. But it was his meeting with Philippe Bestion which was to have a profound impact on Destrez, enabling him to perfect his sense of improvisation and also discover such artists as Bill Evans, McCoy Tyner, Keith Jarrett and Herbie Hancock. At 23, Destrez embarked on his first concert tour alongside a French song artist. One year later, he was spotted by Ludovic Navarre, (alias St. Germain) with whom he recorded the much acclaimed \\"Deep in it\\" which figures on the album Boulevard (F Communications). In 1996, he made a European concert tour with St. Germain and continued to collaborate with him over several years. His phrasing and sense of melody have become key values, particularly on the album Tourist (Blue Note Records), which sold over three million copies worldwide. It was also rated best selling jazz album on its release in the US and awarded 3 \\"Victoires de la Musique\\" in France. Since then, Destrez has collaborated with numerous artists and has participated in diverse musical projects as composer, co-composer and/or instrumentalist (Shazz, Overhead, Oscar, Anthony Fletcher, Martin Solveig, Dimitri from Paris, DJ Yass...) Since 2012, Destrez is working on his new electro jazz project Rive GaucheRive Gauche Website from which the first EP Walking... was released in 2016 on BBE records label.Rive Gauche on BBE Records Since the end of 2012, he has been performing throughout France accompanied by his musicians.  Musical collaborations  = Main collaborations = In 1995, Destrez recorded \\"Deep In It\\" and \\"Street Scene\\" (4 SHAZZ) on St. Germain's album Boulevard. This was followed by several years of collaboration with Ludovic Navarre, starting from the 1996 concert tour in France and Europe up to the recording of the Tourist album (Blue Note records) in 2001. Simultaneously, using the pseudonym Alejandro Del Abelgam,Alejandro Del Abelgam Discogs page on DiscogsAlexandre Destrez Discogs page on Discogs he became the accomplice of another phenomenon of the French House scene: Shazz. He participated in the first eponymous album Shazz nominated in the French award ceremony \\"Victoires de la musique\\" then at the EP \\"El Camino Project\\" (Yellow Prod) and appeared for the first time as artist on the maxi vinyl Shazz & Alexandre Destrez, Hermosa Maria (Epic Records). They went on to jointly produce two titles for Aco, a young singer well known in Japan. In 2001, the second album from Shazz, In the light (Epic Records) came out, on which Destrez composed, arranged, interpreted and collaborated with Shazz and directed the musicians during recording sessions. In 2004, on a third album entitled Beautiful, (Ulm/Universal), Destrez can be heard performing in an even more developed jazz style on a track of the same name. In 2000, Destrez met the group Overhead and became its keyboard player, signing up as artist with Na√Øve Records. The group's first album Silent Witness was acclaimed unanimously by the press. (Les Inrockuptibles, Lib√©ration, \\"ffff\\" T√©l√©rama). Two important events for the group were the concert at \\"La Cigale\\" and a concert on one of Bernard Lenoir's 'Black Sessions' programmes dedicated to Overhead and broadcast live on France Inter. In 2002, David Hachour and Florent Sabaton (alias Oscar), in need of a pianist for their first concert at the Rex Club, contacted Destrez. He went on to join the group and collaborated on several Maxi vinyls and two albums from Oscar: Parisian Soul (2003) and Portrait Robot (2004) with Denote Records. In 2004, Alex composed and interpreted Echoes and Echoes Extended Version (piano solo) for Oscar and Blanck Project respectively. He featured alongside Oscar on the track \\"Mon plus beau matin\\" (additional track on the Japanese version of the album Portrait Robot). He also signed up with Shazz for his first remix \\"Latin Break revisited by Alexandre Destrez\\" (2005 Universal Music ULM). In 2005, Destrez composed and collaborated with David H. on the music of Alabama 65, a project inspired by a cappella recordings made in 1948 of Afro-Americans incarcerated in Alabama. In 2007, the maxi vinyl of Oscar was released featuring Destrez on Silent Day (Denote Records). Destrez also appeared alongside Anthony Fletcher with the release in 2009 of the album Anthony Fletcher Paris. This was followed by a concert tour in France and a live performance on St√©phane Bern's programme Le Fou du Roi on France Inter. Another album \\"I Guess\\" was released in 2011. Since 2005, Destrez has collaborated with the DJ producer Yass and has released over twenty maxi vinyl albums and remixes including: * Inner Soul \\"Support your Dj\\" (Deeply Rooted House - 2005) * Ziggy Funk ft Taliwa \\"Everyday\\" (Yass classic mix - Foliage - 2011) * Rocco Feat Akram \\"Working Hard\\" (Yass remix-House Afrika - 2012) * Yass & Rony Breaker feat.

The Stone mill ruins are located under the Cedar lane bridge spanning the Middle Patuxent River adjacent to the James and Anne Robinson Nature Center. Simpsonville Mill under State Highway Administration bridge to Columbia History Headgate for the mill The Mill has been known as Joshua Warfield's mill, Richard Owing's Mill, and Simpsonville Mill. Annapolis-raised John Hobbs Jr purchased property along the Middle Patuxent River Valley in 1741, selling it to Joshua Dorey in 1749. In 1768, Joshua Dorsey listed the stone mill in his will. The property was acquired by Vachel Worthington in 1789. Richard Owings purchased 11 acres surrounding the mill in 1796 and expanded the property to 1000 acres. The Owings brothers operated several local mills when Napoleonic Wars caused a brief surge in flour prices, making operations very profitable at $11.00 or more a barrel, but declined shortly afterward. In 1852, Charles Ridgley Simpson bought 215 acres surrounding the mill. Production shifted to wool cloth with six employees manning six spindles, four looms, and two carders. William Simpson inherited the mill after his brother's death in 1854. After the conclusion of the Civil War, William Bradshaw operated the mill from 1865 until his death in 1877. The mill was auctioned off and the Ellicott City Times described the mill at this time as... A large three story woolen factory driven by a new turbine wheel of 25 horsepower. Grist Mill, and Saw Mill, Blacksmith and Wheelwright Shop. A Store Building with eight dwelling houses, A large switzer barn with stabling for twelve horses with all necessary farm buildings 215 acres under cultivation and good fencing James Simpson brought the mill back to the Simpson family in 1878 who subsequently sold off a small parcel of the property and converted from wool production back to milling. Justice of the Peace Charles R. and Mary Wilson owned the mill from 1904 to 1909. From 1909 to 1934 former Howard County Commissioner William Welling Iglehart purchased the property with his brother John Iglehart. Iglehart operated the building as a Sawmill, Grist Mill and pre-prohibition basement Cider Mill with production decreasing rapidly by 1915. In 1917 John Iglehart took over. In 1920, a mill fire gutted the building, leaving the stone walls mostly intact. As the Great depression hit, the Eueka-Maryland Assurance Company took over in 1934 after the Igleharts defaulted on a mortgage. In 1963, Howard Research and Development purchased the property. Howard Research and Development (Rouse Corporation) purchased the 58.5 acre site during the formation of the Columbia, Maryland development changing the land to \\"New Town\\" zoning which was later changed to R-ED (Residential - Environmental). In 1977, A new bridge was proposed across the middle Patuxent River at a raised height of 14 feet above water level. A historic inventory was performed in 1979 with little mention of the building's history, noting that it was up to the developer if they chose to submit the property to the national register. In 1993, a State highway project realigned a bridge across the Middle Patuxent to span the Simpsonville Mill site. A $350,000 Archeological dig was performed, finding a dozen homes, a blacksmith and wheelwright shop including evidence of a post office and other shops. A portion of the land forms the Middle Patuxent Environmental Area. In 1994 the Maryland State Highway Administration announced it would build a bridge over the historic mill with matching stone arches. Project engineer John Murphy was quoted \\"It really will be something. It's going to be beautiful,\\" In 2014, the millsite was placed on the Preserve Howard top ten most endangered list due to delays transferring the property from the state highway administration. In 2015, the site ownership was transferred to Howard County, remaining on the endangered list.

He was drafted 2nd in the 2000 Nippon Professional Baseball draft and spent 15 years in the league with the Chiba Lotte Marines, Orix Buffaloes, Yokohama BayStars and Hanshin Tigers. He has signed with the Fukushima Hopes of the Baseball Challenge League as a player/coach for the 2016 season. Early life Kato started playing baseball at four years of age, and at the age of five became a left-handed pitcher. When at Shimizu Commercial High School, he was identified along with Takahiro Yamazaki as a leading pitcher within the Shizuoka Prefecture competition. However, at the summer tournament in his third (and final) year of high school, Kato faced Gotenba High School in the first round and gave up 15 hits and 12 runs in a resounding loss. Kato has cited this regrettable performance as his later motivation.Asahi Shimbun Shizuoka morning edition, July 19, 2002, page 31 At Nihon University, Kato joined the first team squad from the spring of his second year. At the December intensive camp, he undertook a grueling training schedule of throwing 5000 pitches in his second year and 8000 pitches in his third year. In the first division of the Eastern University league he made a total of 42 appearances for an 8-win, 7-loss record, a 3.15 ERA and 80 strikeouts. Kato joined the Kagoshima camp for the Lotte Marines in preparation for the 2000 Sydney Olympics. He was drafted second by Lotte in the 2000 draft. Professional career  =Lotte Marines= In 2001 Kato won 9 games as a starting pitcher, however the rookie of the year award was awarded to Masanobu Okubo of the Orix BlueWave. In the autumn of that year Kato was selected to represent Japan at the 34th IBAF World Cup. In 2002 his record was 11 wins and 15 losses, as he was expected to carry the club as a left-handed starter capable of throwing complete games. However, in 2003 he started suffering from atopy and was unable to perform. This problem has recurred in following years. On July 2, 2005 Kato threw a perfect game against the Yakult Swallows in the second-tier Eastern League, which was the third perfect game in league history, following Masayuki Yamazaki in 1962 and Hiroshi Masumoto in 1987.Chiba Lotte's Kato throws perfect game in Eastern League In 2005 had the lowest ERA in the farm league (1.78) and won a special award for his perfect game. During the 2006 season he was used as a relief pitcher, however shoulder pain saw him dropped from the first team roster and his season ended prematurely. At the start of the 2007 season Kato was listed on the first team roster, but was dropped on March 28 and traded to the Orix Buffaloes for cash on March 30. =Orix Buffaloes= Following the trade, Kato was first tested in the second-team squad. Towards the end of the season he was called up to the first team and pitched well despite not obtaining any wins. On December 19, 2008 Kato changed his registered playing name to his first name Kosuke, similar to some other Japanese players such as Ichiro Suzuki. 2008 was Kato's the first season since his professional debut in which he did not make any appearances in a first-league game. On November 5, 2008 he was given notice of his release by the Buffaloes. Wanting to continue his professional career, he participated in the 12-team joint tryouts. Following that he participated in the Yokohama BayStars' autumn camp, and was officially signed by the BayStars on November 28. He returned to being officially registered under his legal name. =Yokohama Baystars= In the middle of the 2009 season Kato was called up to the first team roster as a relief pitcher, and made a contribution to the team as a reliever, including recording his first win in more than three years on August 15 in a match against the Hiroshima Carp.Yokohama's Ishikawa 2-run squeeze play! Kato's first win in 3 years In 2010, he was again mainly used as a reliever, but a poor season with an ERA of 7.81 in 49 appearances led to him being released for the second time in his career on October 1. He did not participate in the off-season joint tryouts,Yokohama's released Kato will not participate in tryouts, accessed via web archive but was signed by the Hanshin Tigers on December 3 as they were searching for a reliever.Kato contracted: 17 million yen salary, uniform #63 =Hanshin Tigers= Kato was called up to Hanshin's first team in July 2011, but he struggled for consistency in 4 appearances and was returned to the second team just two weeks later. He finished the 2011 season with 31 second- team appearances and an ERA of 2.83. In 2012 Kato made 41 relief appearances for the Tigers' first team, in part due to Ken Nishimura's unavailability due to injury. Kato mainly appeared to finish games that Hanshin was either losing or had a large lead, but he showed consistency with an ERA of 0.83. He started the 2013 season on the first team roster, and was increasingly used in the set-up role from the start of the season due to the team's closer, Yasutomo Kubo being injured.Tigers' Kato slays pinch hitter Itoi for the win, accessed from web archiveThe tide has changed!

He was left out of the 40-man squad selected for the Japan Series against the SoftBank Hawks First team transaction history Despite being active only in the first half of the season, Kato made 32 appearances and recorded 3 wins, his most since 2002, with an ERA of 4.56, which was close to his career average of 4.39.Kosuke Kato: Player profile In 2015 Kato injured his hip in the spring, with the pain reaching the point that he could not run. However, he recovered and was elevated to the first-team squad in July, but was only able to appear in 6 matches. At the end of the season he was released by the Tigers on 2 October 2015. =Baseball Challenge League= At 37 years of age, Kato was the oldest player to participate in the off-season tryouts conducted in November 2015. He faced three batters including his former teammate Kenichi Tagami and succeeded in getting all three out in only 8 pitches. However, he did not receive a contract offer from any NPB clubs. In December 2015 he signed as a player/pitching coach with the Fukushima Hopes of the Baseball Challenge League. At the announcement of his signing, he indicated his intention to remain active as a player with the hope of rejoining the NPB the following season or even sooner should any team face pitching staff shortages during the 2016 season.

Since 2012 he has used these latter pitches more than his curve ball. The breaking of his pitches is his greatest asset, making his strikeout ratio high. Kato recorded double-figure wins in 2002, but even in matches in which he was pitching well, he would suddenly lose his rhythm and allow successive walks and dead balls, so also recorded his career-high of 15 losses in the same year. He was expected to be a starting pitcher capable of pitching complete games. However, even from his third season, illness and injury caused concerns that saw him become a relief pitcher instead. Whilst being a left- handed pitcher and also using chopsticks with his left hand, Kato writes with his right hand. He is well known for wearing sunglasses whilst pitching. It has been reported that since signing with Hanshin, he catches the train to practice and matches at Koshien Stadium.

Its mission is to bring together philosophy enthusiasts; to inspire, strengthen and promote philosophical activity in the Maltese Islands; and to contribute towards society through Philosophy. The foundation does not adhere to, or profess, any single creed or ideology. Its official languages are Maltese and English. Establishment The original idea to create a society in order to provide meeting opportunities, and perhaps study prospects, for members of the general public who were interested in philosophy came from Peter Serracino Inglott. Though he intended to give the initiative a go, he was impeded by his untimely death in March 2012. Subsequently, however, just a few weeks after his death a group of academics, intellectuals and other members of the community came together to bring the idea to fruition. The foundation was established on 21 May, 2012, by public act. It started its public operations on the following 22 June. PSF is registered with the Commission for Voluntary Organisation (VO-0679) and, for the purposes of Maltese law, it is to be considered as a Legal Person (LPF-85). Objectives The objectives of PSF are: * to bring together Maltese philosophers, facilitate discussion of their ideas, and encourage their work; * to promote philosophical investigation; * to share philosophical ideas with the Maltese public; * to assist the documentation, compilation, safe-keeping, and accessibility of the works of Maltese philosophers; * to disseminate information on Maltese philosophers, their work and their ideas; * to foster the participation of Maltese philosophers in public debates; and * to further philosophical understanding and knowledge in general. Activities The activities of PSF include: * organising encounters for Maltese philosophers; * encouraging and facilitating the writing, publication and distribution of works by Maltese philosophers; * furthering research on past and present Maltese philosophers; * establishing a central archive with the works of Maltese philosophers; * coordinating courses, meetings, seminars, conferences and such like gatherings; and * collaborating with entities which can aid the foundation in its objectives and activities. Long-term objectives The long-term objectives of PSF include: * publishing a periodical for the sharing of ideas; * setting up an outlet for the sale of material related to philosophy; * starting an editorial house for the publishing of books on philosophy and other related subjects; and * affiliating the foundation to an established local or foreign institution of higher education for the conferment of academic recognition in philosophy. Membership and management PSF grants membership to who, graduate in philosophy or not, agrees with the mission and objectives of the foundation. Members pay a nominal annual fee. The foundation is governed by a number of members forming a steering committee, two of which are philosophy graduates. The chairperson of the committee is elected by the members of the foundation from among themselves every two years. The committee meets on a monthly basis. The foundation convenes a general assembly each year. The assembly appoints members of the steering committee for the next year of activity, reviews the work done during the preceding year of activity, discusses and adopts amendments to PSF‚Äôs Foundation Deed, and approves the audited accounts of the foundation and cause them to be published. Main organ 300pxPSF's main organ ‚Äî called SHARE ‚Äî is published on a triennial basis. The mission of SHARE is to serve as the official platform of the Philosophy Sharing Foundation, and to disseminate articles and information which contribute to philosophical discussion and debate. The magazine includes articles of a philosophical nature, reviews of books published by Maltese philosophers, snippets from the history of philosophy in Malta, the foundation's news and activities, other Philosophy news from the Maltese Islands, and some philosophical fun items. The magazine's present Editor is Meinrad Calleja. Appreciation By its establishment, PSF introduced a new experience in Malta. Formerly, philosophical activities were restricted to academics somehow connected to the University of Malta. The foundation gave philosophy a wider audience.http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2012-09-23/news/marie-benoits- diary-316354/ It involves the general public in philosophical discussions, and also offers evening courses to adult students.http://markmontebello.blogspot.com/2014/01/il-filosofija-fmalta.html The foundation is a member of the International Federation of Philosophy Societies (FISP)https://www.fisp.org/members.html, and also of the Malta-EU Steering & Action Committee.http://www.meusac.gov.mt/ttemembers References External links * * Philosophy in Malta Category:Organizations established in 2012 Category:Philosophy organizations Category:Philosophical societies Category:Organisations based in Valletta ","title":"Philosophy Sharing Foundation"},{"id":"43008020","text":"Byung-woo is a Korean masculine given name.

The app is included with iPhones and iPod Touch that run iOS 8 or later. The application hold health data such as blood pressure measurement and glucose levels, but also can hold tracking data like step counts. It can pull data from fitness trackers, smartwatches, smart scales, and other devices.  About  The Health app is found on the iPhone and Apple Watch, the icon for the app is a white icon with the red heart. The Health app has four main categories of data - activity, mindfulness, sleep and nutrition. The app can storage health data, tracking data, and clinical medical records, it offers a profile called \\"Medical ID\\" for first responders and can be connected to various hardware devices and third party apps. Initially, the Health app was criticized for its lack of compatible third-party applications (at its release on September 17, 2014, along with iOS 8), glucose tracking, proper health data explanations, and sluggish app performance. Eventually, Apple fixed these issues with a software update. \\"Medical ID\\" is stored within the Health app, this was designed for first responders and shares allergies, medications, blood type and organ donor status. As of July 2016, iOS 10 users or later in the United States were able to sign up to be an organ, eye, and tissue donor in the Apple Health app. In 2018, the Apple Watch series 4 started to offer personal ECG measurement and cardiac health monitoring, which would store to the Health app. Apple's \\"Health Records\\" is a place to store your medical clinical records, and is available if your health insurer or hospital is signed up for the Apple Health Records program. As of 2020, the types of data stored by the Health app include steps, walking and running distance, flights climbed, heart rate, nutrition, sleep analysis, heart rate variability and weight. As of 2020, the devices and hardware compatible with the Health app include, Upright Go 2 posture trainer, La Roche-Posay My Skin UV sensor, Beddit Sleep monitor, Withings smart blood pressure monitor, Withings thermometer, and Withings smart scales.  Electronic Health Records  In 2018, Apple's \\"Health Records\\" was introduced, which allowed on iOS 11.3 or later for users to import their medical records from their doctor or hospital. On June 6, 2019, Northern Louisiana Medical Center announced an early partnership with Apple to allow clinical medical records shared through the app. Shortly after Apple began allowing compatible electronic health records (EHR) to self-register for the \\"Health Records\\" project. Other partnerships in 2019 included University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville, Medical Center of South Arkansas; Northwest Health of Springdale, Arkansas; Blessing Health System of Quincy, Illinois; Doylestown Health of Pennsylvania; Franciscan Health; Bayhealth Medical Center of Dover, Delaware, and the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Employees  In July 2018, Apple hired cardiologist Dr. Alexis Beatty, while working on the Apple Watch and Health integration.

In October 2019, former Columbia University Medical Center cardiologist Dr. David Tsay joined Apple Health.  HealthKit API  HealthKit logo HealthKit is the accompanying developer application programming interface (API) included in the iOS SDK (Software Development Kit) for the Mac. It is used by software developers to design applications that have extensibility and that can interact with the health application on iOS.

Focus Taiwan.\\"Taiwan crowned International Biology Olympiad champion\\". Want China Times. 2014-07-14\\"Taiwan teen diplomats set for Down Under tour\\".Taiwan Today The school was founded in 1955 as a program for high schools in the Taipei city to evacuate to in case of possible wars and airstrikes. Given the dramatic sub urbanization and increases in both population and economical power of Taoyuan, the school has thus gained its independence in 1959. Wuling is the high school with the highest entrance score in Taoyuan since 1959. Nation-wise, Wuling is the 6th most common Alma mater for Taiwan University freshmen in 2017. In general, a large portion of graduates go on to attend universities both national and worldwide every year. National Wu-ling Senior high school has held a student yearly exchange programme with Ozenne High School, Toulouse, France since 2009. History The school was in February 1955 as a part of the evacuation plan for major high schools in Taipei, in response to the possible strikes during the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis. The school, at that time which was named after the Chiedung River nearby, was founded to be a rural campus of Cheng Kung High School. In 1959, the school went independent and renamed Provincial Wu-Ling High School; the name Wuling was a tribute to the Chinese writer Tao Yuanming's famous essay The Peach Blossom Spring, according to school historian's' research. In the 1970 Extension of Mandatory Education and the separation of senior and junior high schools, the junior high school department (grade 7 to 9) was cancelled, the remaining 9-12 grades renamed Provincial Wu-Ling Senior High School. As Taoyuan had promoted to a municipal city in 2015, the school was renamed Municipal Wu-Ling Senior High School in 2018.accordingly. School Life Following the convention of all Taiwanese senior high schools and the 2012 Reformation, Wuling enrolls its student through multiple standardized tests. For most students, the only way in to the school is through the CAP test, holding around late May each year. For students with special gifts in science, mathematics, the Science Class has its own entrance test every March or April. And for musical talented kids, the entrance test for Musial Talented class, standardized for schools in northern Taiwan, is hosted in April or May each year. Other kinds of entrance exams, like Tezhao (), had been around in 2012 but since then never hosted again. Students in Wuling usually start school in 7:30 and end school at 5 o'clock. The period between 7:30 and 8:30 is called Zhaozhixi (Êó©Ëá™Áøí), students are expected to arrive the school at 7:30 and studying or self-learning until 8:00. Although technically, there is no punishment for not arriving at the zhaozhixi and rate of \\"tardy\\" has always been significant. The period between 4 and 5 pm is named Fudaoke (ËºîÂ∞éË™≤), or the \\"helping programs.\\" Ideally, the helping program is limited to the students who are behind his/her classmates, and by law no new lectures should be taught. most students choose to take it for more and better academic performances, also hoping not to fall behind when lectures are illegally given in such periods. Foreign exchanges students are exempted from attending Zahozhixi and Fudaoke. Students are only free to take courses at their free wills at a certain (in other words, not very much) extents. Conveniently, the students are sorted into \\"classes,\\" pupils in the same class take every single course together and have a set, uniformed schedule. There are 21 classes in every grade, about 30 to 50 students in each of them, classes with students less than 30 are rare but possible. In Wuling, similar to that of France, classes are further sorted into 3 streams (È°ûÁµÑ) with different educational focuses in grade 11 and 12. It is interesting that although the legal tender of the streams was demolished by the Ministry of Education in 2002, in the eyes of encouraging school to adopt the free-at-will course selecting system in the US, Wuling still practices it. The educational experiment of free course taking systems was eventually set off in 2016, under the name of Xuanxio (ÈÅ∏‰øÆ). As of 2018, Xuanxio only makes up 2 lecture hours every week, comparing to the 40 total classing hours. For most people, the classes in which they are placed, are decided by a computer random number generator. For the selected minorities, they can choose the class themselves after qualifying yet another series of standardized tests, either the national-level tests mentioned before, or by the school-wide \\"Gifted Student Qualification Tests,\\" or sometimes, by the GPA of their academic performance. Students are expected to buy the uniforms (around NTD 4000) when entering the school and have neat uniforms on them when entering the campus. The dressing codes are constantly debated regarding this topic, both between the school governing body and students, and between the school and the society in general. As for Feb 2018, there is no punishments for not buying or wearing uniforms whatsoever, both by the law and by the school internal dressing code.

Built in 1837, it is a good example of a period town hall/church combination with Federal and Gothic Revival features. Although its religious use has ended, it continues to be used for town offices as well as civic and social functions. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The Weare Town House is located in the town center of Weare, on the east side of New Hampshire Route 114 (its principal north-south route), about north of Memorial Drive. It is a 2¬Ω-story frame structure, covered by a gabled roof and finished in wooden clapboards. The main facade is fairly plain, with a double-door entrance at the center, and three sash windows on the second level. A two- stage tower rises above the facade, with pinnacles at the corners of each stage, and a louvered belfry in the second stage. The belfry houses a bell manufactured in 1837 by George Holbook of East Medway (now Millis), Massachusetts; Holbrook had received his training in the bell foundry of Paul Revere. The hall was built in 1837 to serve both as a town meeting space and a place for the local Universalist congregation to meet. The interior was originally arranged so that town meetings were held on the first floor and church services on the second. The upstairs was adapted for use as a high school in 1919, and has also been home to local fraternal organizations. The building continues to be used for town facilities, and the meeting space is rented out for private social functions in addition to its civic uses.

Geography  The line runs from Heide station as a continuation of the Neum√ºnster‚ÄìHeide railway parallel to the Marsh Railway and then running under it and passing through shallow marsh land to B√ºsum. The most important stop along the way is in the small town of Wesselburen. B√ºsum station is on the North Sea and is mainly used by tourists. History  The Weddinghusen‚ÄìWesselburen section was opened on 1 November 1878 by the Wesselburen‚ÄìHeider Eisenbahngesellschaft (Wesselburen‚ÄìHeide Railway Company) as a branch line of the existing Heide‚ÄìKarolinenkoog railway, opened in 1877. The extension of this branch line to B√ºsum was opened for freight on 1 November 1883. Passenger services commenced on 15 November 1883. From the outset operations were carried out by the West Holstein Railway Company (Westholsteinische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft), which bought the Wesselburen‚ÄìHeide Railway Company on 1 April 1881. The Western Holstein railway company was taken over by the Prussian state railways on 1 July 1890. AKN train near Jarrenwisch An extensive network of 750 mm gauge railways (the Wesselburener Spurbahnen) ran to Wesselburen for the carriage of agricultural produce, which was then transported towards Heide. In the late 1950s, passenger services included, in addition to stopping trains, a pair of express services on the route from B√ºsum via Heide and Neum√ºnster to Eutin. In the 1980s, the use of uneconomic train sets (a class V 100 locomotive hauling Silberling carriages with a control car) led to a temporary decline of the line. B√ºsum station All sidings on the Heide‚ÄìB√ºsum line have been removed and stations have been downgraded to halts (that is all sets of points at the stations have been removed). B√ºsum port railway From 5 November 2000, operations on the line were won at tender by Schleswig-Holstein-Bahn GmbH, a subsidiary of AKN Eisenbahn AG (operator of the Hamburg-Altona‚ÄìNeum√ºnster railway). Osterhof and Haferwisch stations were closed as part of the launch of the associated regular interval timetable between Heide and B√ºsum. Since the AKN won the tender for operations on the Neum√ºnster‚ÄìHeide railway in 2003, the two have been operated under a common timetable number. Most trains coming from Neum√ºnster continue to B√ºsum. Services are operated with LINT 41 railcars. Since the timetable change in December 2011, the line has been operated by NBE Nordbahn Eisenbahngesellschaft mbh & Co. KG, a joint subsidiary of AKN Eisenbahn AG and BeNEX GmbH. These trains mostly run to Neum√ºnster. Freight traffic officially ended on 28 February 1994. However, the B√ºsum port railway is maintained for possible future use.

Knollys was the eldest surviving son of Charles Knollys of Oxfordshire and his wife Elizabeth Lister, daughter of Michael Lister of Burwell, Lincolnshire.

He was returned unopposed at the 1734 British general election and voted with the Administration on the Spanish convention in 1739 and on the place bill in 1740. Knollys became 2nd major in the 1st troop of Life Guards in 1737. He died on 6 June 1740, pre-deceasing his father.

The property was one of the region's largest dairy farms in the early 19th century, and it was used as Hillsborough County's poor farm between 1867 and 1896. The main focus of the property is a large Federal-style brick house built c. 1800 by Oliver Whiting; it also has an 1846 Gothic Revival barn which predates the establishment of the poor farm. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Whiting family was one of the wealthiest in the neighboring town of Temple, when Lt. Oliver Whiting Jr. was married in 1800. It is believed that the main house on this property was built soon thereafter; its fine period details, which were uncommon in what was then a largely rural community, were probably the result of design influences brought in from other areas by the Whitings. The Whiting farm became the centerpiece of a dairy operation that was by the 1850s the largest in Wilton. Oliver's son David purchased an operation in 1857 that included a daily railroad run to Boston, Massachusetts, carrying fresh milk. The barn, with its Gothic Revival cupola, was built by the Whitings in 1846, and is a good example of a bank barn, with entrances on two levels. The property was purchased by Hillsborough County in 1867, and adapted for use as a poor farm. A number of buildings were added during this period of the property's history, including a multistory almshouse, water supply infrastructure, and a \\"pest house\\", a structure built out of recycled building materials located at a remove from the main building complex. Only foundations of most of these features now survive, since they were dismantled after the poor farm's closure in 1896. In the early 20th century the property was transformed into a summer estate by the Beebe family.

History Hen Dyffryn Gwyn is a typical old Welsh cottage. It dates back to 1640 and is thought to have originally been built with a three-room plan. In the late eighteenth century a staircase was added in the centre; there is an inscribed stone on the outside wall dated 1772 which may commemorate this. In the nineteenth century a detached brewhouse was added and in the twentieth century, this was linked to the house. In 1965, minor alterations were made to the interior of the house, but apart from this, little has changed over the years. The house The house is built of dressed stone blocks on boulder footings with large quoins. The roof would have originally been thatched but is now slated. There are chimney stacks at both ends, the one on the left being flush with the end wall and original. The main door is right of centre and is surmounted by a small arch. There are three windows on the ground floor and three half-dormer windows in the roof. There is a stone inscribed \\"HP 1640\\" above the left, mullioned window. The entrance hall has a straight staircase and wooden partitioning on either side separating it from the parlour on the right and the kitchen on the left.

Some words were in use throughout the coalfields, some are historic and some are local to the different British coalfields. A Adit :An adit is an underground level or tunnel to the surface for access or drainage purposes. Afterdamp :Afterdamp is a mixture of carbon monoxide and chokedamp which replaces atmospheric air after an explosion. Agent :The agent was the senior colliery manager: the term \\"viewer\\", \\"captain\\" or \\"steward\\" also appeared in older regional terminology. Where the mine owner provided the capital and sank the shafts, the agent organised the development of the colliery, determined mining methods, advised the owner on the mine's commercial management and labour policy, and in later years was generally a trained mining engineer. In the management hierarchy the agent was superior to the colliery manager and under-manager, who had day to day operational responsibility. An agent responsible for several collieries and managers was termed a \\"general manager\\". Dictionary of Occupational Terms Based on the Classification of Occupations used in the Census of Population, 1921 ORDER III. MINING AND QUARRYING OCCUPATIONS Sub-order 1. In Coal and Shale Mines 040. Owners, Agents, Managers, accessed 9-10-18 Airway :A roadway used for ventilation. B Bank, pit bank or pit brow :The bank, pit bank or pit brow is the area at the top of the shaft. Banksman or banker :A banksman, banker, hillman or browman works at the pit bank to dispatch the coals, and organise the workforce. He is in charge of loading or unloading the cage, drawing full tubs from the cages and replacing them with empty ones. The counterpart role at pit bottom is the onsetter. Bell :A bell, bell stone or pan was a loose, roughly bell-shaped stone in the mine roof, liable to fall without warning: the cause of many coalmine fatalities. Bells were usually found in shale, but rarely in sandstone. Bevin Boys :Bevin Boys were men conscripted to work in the collieries during World War II in a scheme introduced by Ernest Bevin. Bell pitMiddleton Park, Leeds :A bell pit was a type of coal mine in which coal found close to the surface was extracted by sinking a shaft and removing coal from around it until the roof became unstable. It was then abandoned and left to subside. Bind :A term used in various areas to refer to shale, mudstone, clay or sandstone overlying the seam. Bituminous coal :Bituminous coal is a type of coal found in the most coalfields. It is laid down in seams and varies in constituency and quality. It was used to produce town gas or coke, raise steam in industrial boilers or locomotives, to fuel power stations or for domestic heating. Blackdamp :Blackdamp is the name given to a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Blower :A blower was a source of firedamp issuing into the mine from a fissure in the coal. The term \\"feeder\\" was used in some areas. The issue of gas was often audible, hence the name. Brattice :Brattice, strong canvas sheeting coated in tar to make it air-tight, is used to make partitions to deflect air into particular areas of a colliery or divide a shaft to improve ventilation and dilute flammable or noxious gases. Bump :A bump, pounce, thump or goff was a sudden movement in the strata while underground and occasionally gave warning of an imminent outburst.Lama and Bodziony (1996) Outbursts of Gas, Coal and Rock in Underground Coal Mines, p.189 They were often preceded by a characteristic noise, also in some areas called a bump. Trainee miners often found bumps a frightening experience. Butterfly :A butterfly is a safety link or detaching hook above the cage attached to the winding rope to prevent the cage from being over wound. It was invented by Edward Ormerod. Butty :A miner's name for a working partner (South Wales) or for their opposite number on another shift (N. England) but also in earlier times an alternative name for a charter master. The \\"butty system\\" was the contracting system used by charter masters. C Cage :The cage is the iron framework in which men and coal tubs are wound up and down the shaft. It could have one or more decks to increase its capacity. Chargehand :General term for a supervisory worker. Charter master :A charter master, butty or contractor was in the 19th century and earlier a man who contracted with a pit owner to work a colliery seam for a tonnage price, while arranging and paying for labour himself. Bulman and Redmayne (1906) Colliery Working and Management, Lockwood, p.402 While this labour system gradually fell into disuse except in small collieries, until nationalisation the term \\"charter master\\" was in a few areas still sometimes used to refer to the supervisory official usually called a deputy.Haynes (1953) Nationalization in Practice: The British Coal Industry, p.90 Chock :A chock was originally a piece of timber used to support the face. In later years hydraulic chocks were used. Collier :In its most restricted sense, a collier is a worker who \\"gets\\" the coal, i.e. a hewer or coal getter. Contraband :Contraband was material banned from being taken down the mine, generally for safety reasons, such as matches and cigarettes. Miners were regularly checked for contraband. D Damp : Damp is gas, it derives from the German word dampf meaning vapour. Dataller : A dataller, day wage man or day-man was paid on a daily basis for work done as required. Datallers' work included building and repairing roadways. Davy lamp :A Davy lamp is an early type of safety lamp named after its inventor, Sir Humphry Davy. A similar lamp was designed by George Stephenson. Day level :A level driven from the surface. Deep :Workings and roadways at a level below the pit bottom. Deputy :A \\"deputy overman\\", deputy, fireman (North Wales and parts of Lancashire) or examiner (South Wales) was an underground official who had supervision of a district and the men working in it.Church and Outram (2002) Strikes and Solidarity: Coalfield Conflict in Britain, 1889-1966, CUP, p.23 Deputies were designated as the competent person directly responsible for the safety of their district and inspection of its roadways. The role developed as an amalgamation of several earlier roles: in early mining, deputies were responsible for timbering, while a \\"fireman\\" was originally responsible for testing for firedamp: an \\"examiner\\" was originally the supervisor on a non coal turning shift, earning less pay than a deputy. Deputies were promoted from amongst experienced miners: from 1911, the role required certification of competence, but gradually changed so that supervision of production was added to safety responsibilities. Deputies carried a yardstick, originally a measuring stick but later adapted to raise a safety lamp to test for gas, and later still to mount a gas testing bulb. Deputies like other officials also carried a relightable version of the standard safety lamp. Dip :Declivity of the strata. A heading or roadway following the dip of the strata was called a \\"dip road\\" or (in the North and Scotland) a \\"dook\\". Barrowman, J. Glossary of Scotch Mining Terms, scottishmining.co.uk, accessed 06-10-18 District :A district is a specific, usually named area of the coalface where particular seams are worked. Doggy :A doggy, also known as a corporal in the Midlands, was an underground supervisor with responsibility for the haulage men; the role was similar to that of the deputy at the face, and later sometimes included the responsibility of the deputy to test for gas.Griffin (1977) The British coalmining industry, Moorland, p.33 Downcast, downcast shaft :The downcast is the shaft by which fresh air descends into the mine. After a disaster at Hartley Colliery in 1862, legislation decreed that collieries should have two means of entering the coal workings. In effect this meant two shafts which aided ventilation. Downthrow :A fault, when approached from the higher side. Drawer :A drawer, putter (Northumberland), hurrier (Yorkshire), or waggoner is a person, usually a boy or young man who pushes tubs of coal from the coal face to the pit eye. Before 1842 women did this type of work in some coalfields. Drift :A drift is an underground road between seams; to be distinguished from drift mining. E Engine pit :The shaft where the pumping engine was located was often termed the \\"engine pit\\"; the second shaft sunk, during development, was termed the \\"bye pit\\". In practice the bye pit usually served as the upcast or air shaft. Engineer :In traditional terminology a mine engineer was a senior person responsible for all boilers and machinery and for supervision of the enginewrights. In Scotland an \\"engineer\\" referred to a surveyor. Engineman :An engineman drove a haulage engine; a winding engineman or winder drove the winding engine. Eye or pit-eye : The eye or pit-eye is the area at the bottom of the shaft. F Face or coal face :The coal face is the place where coal is cut from the coal seam either manually by hewers or mechanically by machine. Firedamp :Firedamp is explosive, flammable gas consisting predominantly of methane. Fitter :A fitter is a worker responsible for the maintenance of underground machinery. Furnace, furnace pit :Furnaces were used in the 19th century instead of fans for ventilation. The furnace was usually at the bottom of the upcast shaft which acted as a chimney, creating airflow throughout the workings. G Gannister :Gannister is siliceus fireclay which can be used to make firebricks. Garland :A garland was a water channel or gutter in the lining of a mine shaft. Gate :A gate is a tunnel serving the coal face, the maingate is where fresh air enters and the tailgate is where spent air exits. Goaf, gove or gob :The goaf, gove, gob, shut or waste is the void from which all the coal in a seam has been extracted and where the roof is allowed to collapse in a controlled manner.The term possibly comes from Welsh language ogof, gof, \\"cave\\". H Headframe, headstocks or headgear :The headframe, headstocks or headgear is the framework holding the winding wheel over the shaft. Heading :A roadway generally; more specifically, a roadway in the process of development. Heave :Heave or floor heave refers to the floor of a roadway lifting as a result of ground stresses, reducing the roadway height. Soft floors can also bubble up; this was called \\"creep\\". Hewer :A hewer is a coal face worker who digs coal, loosening the coal with a pick. Hurrier, putter, drawer or waggoner : A hurrier (Yorkshire), putter (Northumberland), waggoner or drawer (Lancashire) was the historic local term for the person who brought empty coal tubs up to the coal face and took loaded tubs to the pit bottom. I Inbye :Inbye means going away from the pit shaft towards the coal face (Opposite of outbye). Inset :An inset is an opening part way down a shaft giving access to intermediate levels of a mine. Intake :An intake airway is one along which fresh air travels into the mine. J Jenkin :A jenkin is a narrow excavation driven through a pillar of coal.Peele (1894) Elementary Text-book of Coal Mining, Blackie, p.277 Jud :Jud, or judd (Derbyshire, North-East), is a depth of coal in the face that will fall after being undercut: a coal face ready for taking down. Griffiths (1999) North- Eastern Dialect, University of Northumbria, p.99 \\"Web\\", \\"fall\\", and other terms were used elsewhere. K Koepe winding :Koepe is a system of winding, using the friction between the winding ropes and the drive pulley. It was developed in Germany and introduced to England by the National Coal Board. L Lampman :A lampman had responsibility for maintaining lamps and for issuing them from the lamp room at the start of a shift. Level :A level is a roadway along the strike of the strata, i.e. at right angles to the dip. Longwall face :A longwall face is a coal face of considerable length between the gates from which the coal is removed. M Main gate :The main gate is the intake airway and the conveyor belt road to move coal from the face to the shaft. Man winding :Man winding: the process of using the cage to transport workers up or down the shaft. Also referred to as manriding, though the latter also referred to transport elsewhere in the pit. \\"Man winding speed\\" was usually set lower than mineral winding speed. Manager :A colliery manager was appointed by the owner or agent and had overall charge of coal production and labour policy.Church (2002), p.25 Managers required certification following the 1872 Mines Act: in practice the duties of the manager were very varied and might extend to all parts of the business. The manager was responsible for observance of the regulations under the Coal Mines Act 1911 and was required to make a daily personal supervision of the mine. They were assisted by one or more undermanagers and by the overmen, who largely assumed the face-to-face aspects of labour management. In the case of smaller mines, the regulations allowed the owner or agent to appoint themselves as manager. Master shifter :The master shifter supervised gangs of shifters (labourers), repairers and stonemen carrying out work during the night repairing shift. N NACODS :Nacods is an abbreviation for the National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers. This was the union that represented colliery officials and underofficials in Great Britain. O Official :Colliery officials and underofficials, as distinguished from managers, were qualified workers with practical supervisory responsibility: overmen, deputies and shotfirers. Onsetter :Worker at pit bottom responsible for loading the cages. Outbye :Outbye means going towards the pit shaft from the coal face. (opposite of inbye). Outcrop :An outcrop is where the coal seam is exposed at the surface. Overcast :A place where one roadway crosses another, specifically where an airway was built across the top of another airway for ventilation purposes. Overman :The overman or (in a few areas) overlooker, bailiff or gaffer was the foreman or senior underground official of a pit, immediately subordinate to the manager and under-managers. They were themselves superior to the deputies and had competence to run the whole of the underground workings in the management's absence. The overman was responsible for production or output, although after mechanisation elements of this role began to be assumed by the deputies. There was generally one overman for each shift. Overwind :A type of accident in which winding of the cage failed to stop at the top or bottom of the shaft.Headstocks, Mining Heritage, accessed 06-10-18 The consequences of such an accident could be extremely serious, as at Brookhouse Colliery, 1958, or the 1973 Markham Colliery disaster. Owner :The owner or coal owner, also called the lessee or coal master, held the lease to work minerals. They provided the capital and sank the shafts, and in some cases might act as a managing director. However except in small mines, mine development, pricing, buying materials and other technical and commercial considerations were the responsibility of the agent or viewer. P Pack :Loose stone built up to support the roof. Pass-bye :A pass-bye or passbye was a siding for coal tubs.Minutes of evidence taken before the select committee on mines, Parliamentary Papers v. 14, 1866, p.114 Pillar :A pillar is a section of unworked coal supporting the roof. Unworked pillars of coal are left to prevent subsidence to surface features. The shaft pillar is left to prevent damage to the shafts from the workings. Pit :Strictly refers to a shaft, though also used to refer to a colliery more generally. Pit brow lasses :Pit brow (pit broo) lasses were women who worked at the coal screens on the pit top up to the mid-1960s, mainly in the Lancashire and Cumberland coalfields. Pitman :While the term \\"pitman\\" is sometimes used to refer to any underground worker, it was more specifically used, particularly under the NCB, to refer to a worker who inspected and repaired the shafts.[http://doot.spub.co.uk/code.php?value=047 A Dictionary of Occupational Terms Based on the Classification of Occupations used in the Census of Population, 1921 ORDER III. MINING AND QUARRYING OCCUPATIONS], accessed 03-10-18 The terms \\"shaftman\\", \\"shanker\\" and \\"shaft hand\\" were also regionally used. Amongst other duties the pitman could be expected to descend the shaft on top of the cage, visually checking for problems. Props or pit props :Props or pit props are timber or hydraulic supports holding up the roof. Puncheon :A short post, especially one used for supporting the roof in a coal mine. Putter : A putter (Northumberland), hurrier (Yorkshire), waggoner or drawer (Lancashire) was the local term for the person who brought empty coal tubs up to the coal face and took loaded tubs to the pit bottom. R Repairer :A repairer carries out work on roads, roofs, etc; in Wales a repairer was a timberman. Rescue man :A member of the colliery rescue team, trained in first aid and to work using a respirator. Rescue men could be volunteers or (after the Coal Mines Act 1911) members of an area's permanent Rescue Brigade. Return :A return is a roadway along which foul air travels from the face on its way out of the mine. Ripper, Ripping :Rippers are men who remove the rock above the coal seam and set rings (arches) to raise the height of the gate or road as the coal face advances. S Screens :Term for the pit head, where coal was sorted from dirt before washing. Shaft :A shaft is a vertical or near-vertical tunnel that gives access to a coal mine accommodating the cage and providing ventilation. Shotfirer :A shotfirer is a colliery underofficial qualified to detonate shots or explosive charges. Becoming a shotfirer was often a step towards becoming a deputy: whether deputies should also be permitted to detonate shots in addition to their other duties was a matter of some debate during the 20th century. Sinker :A sinker specialises in creating new mine shafts. A \\"master sinker\\" had supervision of a team of sinkers. Slope :A slope road, also known as a slant (in Wales), downbrow, or gug (Somerset) was a roadway driven at an angle to a level course. Sough :A sough is a drainage tunnel to take water from coal mines without the need to pump it to the surface. An example is the Great Haigh Sough. Snap or bait :Snap, bait or piece is food taken to eat part way through the shift and often carried in a snap tin. Spoil tip Gin Pit Colliery's old spoil tip or rucks :A spoil tip is a pile built of accumulated spoil - the overburden or other waste rock removed during coal and ore mining. Squeeze :A squeeze, weight or pinching was settling of the strata over a worked out area, resulting in lowering of the roof. Stinkdamp :Sulphuretted hydrogen gas, lethal following brief exposure. Surveyor :A surveyor, latcher, dialler or (in Scotland) engineer was responsible for taking bearings underground, plotting surveys and drawing plans; a surveyor's assistant was also called a \\"chainman\\". Sylvester :A sylvester, or nanny, was a ratchet device for pulling out pit props, used particularly when collapsing the roof during longwall mining. T Timberman :A timberman cut, shaped and set pit props. Trapper : A trapper was a child employed (before 1842) to open and close doors in roadways along which the coal tubs were transported. Tub :Tubs or coal tubs are wooden or iron vessels to carry coal. U Upcast, upcast shaft :The upcast is the shaft by which the spent air is expelled after ventilating the mine workings. It may be considered a type of chimney. Upthrow :An upthrow fault has moved a seam to a higher level. V Viewer :A term used from the 18th century, the viewer was the agent or surveyor appointed by the owner to manage the colliery. W Winding engine at Astley Green Colliery Museum Whitedamp :Whitedamp is another name for a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulphide. Whitedamp received its name as lights tended to burn more brightly in its presence. Winder :The winder is either the winding engine that raises or lowers the cages in a shaft or the man who operates it. X Y Z Yard :Yard could refer to the pit top and its surroundings or the name of a coal seam.

He is known for his portraits of tribal and indigenous peoples. Background and early career James Philip Nelson was born in 1967 in Sevenoaks, Kent. He spent his childhood in Africa, Asia and South America, traveling around with his father, who worked as a geologist for International Shell. At the age of 7, he was sent to Stonyhurst College, a Jesuit boarding school in Lancashire, UK. When he was 16, he suffered from Alopecia totalis, a condition in which all the hair falls out, which was caused by a culmination of stress and a reaction to malaria medication. In 1985, at age 17, he left his boarding school and started to trek the length of Tibet on foot. He took a small camera on his trip and photographed his journey, which lasted about two years. Upon return, the collection of pictures he had taken in the formerly inaccessible country were published by the English National Geographic, to wide international acclaim. Following this journey, Nelson embarked on more trips, documenting a variety of war zones, including Afghanistan, Kashmir, Yugoslavia, Somalia and El Salvador, and started to work as a professional photojournalist, until the age of 24. In 1992 Nelson was commissioned by Shell Oil to produce the book \\"Literary Portraits of China\\". He travelled across the country for 30 months, together with his then wife, Ashkaine Hora Adema, who participated in the making of the book, and became the subsequent business partner of Nelson. From 1997 and onwards, Nelson began working in the commercial advertising field. During this time, he continued collecting images of remote and isolated cultures. Photography  = Before They Pass Away = In 2010, Nelson started to work on his second book, Before they Pass Away. He travelled for 3 years and photographed more than 35 indigenous tribes around the world in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, and the South Pacific, using a 50-year-old 4x5in camera. Nelson said the project was \\"inspired by Edward S. Curtis and his great photographs of Native Americans\\". Like Curtis, Nelson documents his subjects in a romantic, stylised and posed manner, with the aim of \\"putting them on a pedestal\\". Nelson remarks that the project is not meant to convey \\"a documentary truth, but rather [his] own artistic interpretation and a celebration of diversity and beauty.\\" The tribes that Nelson photographed include the Huli and Kalam tribes of New Guinea, the Tsaatan of Mongolia and the Mursi people of the Omo River valley in southern Ethiopia. In a TED talk he described the working process used in this project and stated it occasionally took \\"months trying to find [these indigenous peoples] and then again weeks to gain their trust and permission to photograph [them].\\" Nelson borrowed the funds for the project from a Dutch billionaire, Marcel Boekhoorn. As a result of the project, a book containing the photographs and texts, a limited edition of the book, as well as printed photo portraits were published. = Homage to Humanity = In September 2018 Nelson published his third book, Homage to Humanity. The book consist of over 400 photographs of 30 indigenous cultures, interviews with tribal members, infographics on the portrayed locations and cultures, as well as an application which incorporates 360¬∞ film material connected to the pictures, behind the scenes videos and background information regarding the travels. For the creation of his last book, he travelled with an assistant, Stephanie van der Wiel, a fellow photographer whom he met at Leiden's National Museum of Ethnology, where he was presenting an exhibition of material from his first book. Homage to Humanity is a continuation of Nelson's previous work, but purportedly sets itself apart in its more inclusive nature of its subjects. Through this approach, Nelson aspired to acknowledge the criticism his previous book, Before they Pass Away, generated controversy. In the book's foreword, Mundiya Kepanga, Papuan chief from the Tari region in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea, writes, \\"My culture is who I am. It gives me my values and my sense of home, things I know I would lose if I had to adjust to the way of life that seems to be taking over our planet today. I believe that projects such as this book will help my generation and younger ones to sustain our unique and precious culture for the future.\\"  The Jimmy Nelson Foundation  The Jimmy Nelson Foundation is a nonprofit organisation founded in 2016 to stimulate cultural expression by facilitating projects that promote the heritage of indigenous cultures. Nelson says, \\"The foundation has evolved into teaching indigenous peoples‚Äô pride. I'm creating many teams to go off around the world and do what I do. We‚Äôre gathering [pictures, video and other information] and creating a digital fireplace, sort of like a library in the sky, of all this heritage for future generations.\\" The Foundation's most prominent project involved a collaboration with J. Walter Thompson India and J. Walter Thompson Amsterdam. The campaign opened with a short film, titled Blink. And they‚Äôre gone., made using more than 1,500 photographs taken by Nelson during his travels. The film took 90 days to edit, and includes images of the Huli Wigmen from Papua New Guinea, the Kazakhs of Mongolia, the Sadhus of India, the Wodaabe from Chad and a number of other cultures. The film was directed by JWT India's chief creative officer, Senthil Kumar in Mumbai, working closely with J. Walter Thompson's global creative lead, Bas Korsten. Controversy Nelson's work has been the subject of much criticism from a variety of sources, including the very people he photographs and represents in his book. In June 2014 Nelson's project Before They Pass Away came under attack from Stephen Corry, director of Survival International , the global movement for tribal peoples‚Äô rights. In a review titled \\"Turning a Blind Eye to Pure Old Vibrations\\" published on the Truthout website, Corry attacked Nelson's work for presenting a false and damaging picture of tribal peoples.Truthout Accessed 6 June 2014 Corry maintained that Nelson's pictures bore little relationship either to how the people look now, or to how they've ever appeared. Corry writes, \\"In his photos of the Waorani Indians of Ecuador, he has them unclothed except for their traditional waist string. The Indians are not only shorn of their everyday clothes, but also of other manufactured ornaments such as watches and hair clips. In real life, contacted Waorani have routinely worn clothes for at least a generation, unless, that is, they are 'dressing up' for tourists. [‚Ä¶] His Waorani female models have now preserved their modesty by tying 'fig' leaves into their waist string, which they would never have done formerly: the images look like a throwback to a past era, but they're also a contemporary invention.\\" Corry goes on to allege that Nelson not only presents a fictionalised portrait of tribal people, but more importantly that he glosses over the violence to which many of the tribes pictured are being subjected and fails to mention, that many minority peoples, especially tribal ones, are not \\"disappearing\\", but that they are being destroyed through illegal theft of their land and resources. Nelson defended his work against the criticism of Survival International in a BBC interview, explaining, \\"The pictures are definitely arranged. People don't naturally stand under a waterfall at 7 am waiting for the sun to rise, unless you ask them to. I‚Äôm presenting these people in a way that hasn't been done before. We present ourselves in the developed world in a very idealised, stylised way because we believe we are important. I‚Äôve given them the time, the respect that we would give ourselves...\\" Nelson denies exploiting any of the indigenous communities, and claims that only after gaining trust and understanding of their culture they grant him access. In an article published in The Times, Nelson defended his book by saying that it was never meant to be reportage, but an \\"aesthetic, romantic, subjective, iconographic representation of people who are normally represented in a very patronising and demeaning way.\\" Papuan tribal leader Benny Wenda has also criticized Nelson for describing his tribe as \\"headhunters\\", when in fact the Dani have never practised cannibalism. Mr Wenda said: ‚ÄúThe real headhunters are the Indonesian military who have been killing my people. My people are still strong and we fight for our freedom. We are not ‚Äòpassing away,‚Äô we are being killed by the brutal Indonesian soldiers. That is the truth.‚Äù Nelson's work has also been criticized for harmful inaccuracies and generalizations, which Nelson uses to make himself and his photography look good, but which harm the cause of the tribal people he is using. Julia Lagoutte writes in the OpenDemocracy: \\"It is simply not true that tribal people have been \\"unchanged for thousands of years\\"; they have been evolving constantly, as we have. It is clear that for Nelson, their attraction and purity is rooted in their exclusion from the future, and their containment to the past ‚Äì so that is the only reality he presents in his photos. By omitting their interactions with the ‚Äòmodern world‚Äô that they are a part of, and perpetuating the myth that they are dying out, Nelson's work freezes tribal peoples in the past and effectively denies them a place in this world.\\" Lagoutte writes \\"It is staggering that Nelson can mention Huli anger at having had their land exploited in the past but make no mention of the current nightmarish situation of Papuan tribes, who face systematic rape, torture, arbitrary arrest and murder under Indonesia's racist military occupation.\\" \\"The title [Before They Pass Away] was melodramatic,\\" Nelson said in an interview with WBUR. \\"A little naive. Everyone got upset saying, \\"Who's dying?\\" It was a little bit naive, but then it actually paid off because it caused a big discussion.\\" Nelson also received criticism from fellow photographers, such as Timothy Allen, a veteran photographer for the BBC's Human Planet. He states that, \\"the patronizing and self-aggrandizing narrative behind 'Before They Pass Away' is literally painful to watch.\\" With his last project, Homage to Humanity, Nelson claims to have listened to the criticism. 'Before They Pass Away' sparked what was sometimes quite a positive but otherwise heated conversation... In Homage to Humanity I wanted to give more of a voice to the subjects‚Äîtheir dreams and their opinions and their worldview.\\"  Personal life  Nelson was married to his wife, Ashkaine Hora Adema for 23 years, and as of 2018, they separated. Nelson and Adema have three children together. Nelson is currently based in Amsterdam, where his company Jimmy Nelson Pictures B.V. is located. Publications   See also  * Edward S.

The settlement lies across the banks of Big Creek where the seasonal stream meanders against the base of bluffs capped by massive limestone blocks, in which lies the 20th-century origin of the community. The original settler name for the location was Hog Back, with a railway station first established there with that name in 1881. Hog Back was the local name for the high limestone and chalk ridge that runs from just west of old Fort Hays to Ellis (this station was later moved‚Äîsee Hog Back, Kansas). These bluffs are the local outcrop of the Fort Hays Limestone. Founded in 1906 by business partners Erasmus Haworth, the first state geologist of Kansas, and I. M. Yost, leading businessman and miller of Hays, Yocemento is one of the several communities around the outskirts of the High Plains that were founded to use Fort Hays Limestone to manufacture Portland cement.  History  = Pre-American settlement = 1718 Guillaume de L'Isle map showing Padoucas villages on the upper rivers of northwest Kansas (Cansez). The earliest studied human occupation of the Yocemento location is a settlement interpreted as the rarely preserved Early Ceramic (ca. 400‚Äì1100 CE) Keith phase of the Woodland culture. This phase is evidenced by particular shards of Harlan Cord- Roughened ceramic jars, chipped stone tools (including well-made, small, corner-notched arrowheads), charcoal, bone tools, and mussel shell middens found along the high, steep banks of Big Creek just west of Yocemento. Dating to about 1000 CE, it is thought to be a butchering and tool working site: Animal bones include bison, deer, and small mammals. The on-site manufacture of stone tools included heat treatment of quartzite, flint, silicified Smoky Hill Chalk, and silcrete. Given that no evidence of permanent occupation has been found here, the site is considered to have been a warm season hunting camp. Early 18th-century French cartographer Guillaume Delisle's map of the Mississippi River located Padoucas (Comanche) villages on the upper forks of the Kansas River (Big Creek lies between the Smoky Hill and Saline Rivers). By the early 19th century, however, the Pawnee had a large seasonal hunting camp 11 miles to the south with the Pawnee Trail passing nearby to the east. However, by the time of the first United States settlements here in the mid-19th century, the Pawnee had diminished and the general territory was under the claim of the Kiowa and Comanche to the south and west and, more significantly, the Cheyenne and Arapaho to the north and west. = Railroad construction and conflict = August 2, 1867, action between the Dog Soldiers and the 10th Cavalry (Buffalo Soldiers) about north of future Yocemento. (C. Taylor, 1911) In 1867, construction of the Kansas Pacific Railway west of Junction City precipitated conflict with the tribes that claimed this region of the High Plains as buffalo hunting grounds. The original public plan for the Kansas Pacific Railway (then UPED) was to follow the Kansas River to Fort Riley, and then progress up the Republican River to Fort Kearny in Nebraska. This course avoided the Cheyenne main buffalo hunting grounds. However, as the tracks reached Junction City, it became clear that the Union Pacific Railroad would win the race to Fort Kearny and the 100th meridian; so, the Kansas Pacific instead surveyed a new course to Denver along the Smoky Hill Trail. Even though the Smoky Hill Trail was more hazardous than either the Santa Fe Trail or Platte River routes, it was the most direct route from the East to Denver. The rapid construction of track to Salina and up through the Smoky Hills, followed by the letting of contracts to extend railroad out on to the High Plains west of Ellsworth to Park's Fort, was perceived as a violation of Cheyenne and Arapaho territory. From July through August, Dog Soldiers attacked workers and settlers along the line of construction, including near Salina, Bunker Hill, and Wilson. On August 1, seven workers were killed at Campbell's grading camp (present-day Victoria). followed by the Battle of the Saline River the next day just 12 miles north of present day Yocemento. However, it was the September 20 attack on Park's Fort, west of Hays City, that caused a complete halt to surveying and construction west of Hays. Thousands of construction workers, surveyors, and early settlers retreated from the west to the weeks-old settlement of Rome. October construction east of Hays City brought the end-of-track just a few miles short of the future Yocemento site. This situation was the context of the October 1867 photographs of the Yocemento location made by Alexander Gardner; all construction west of his pictures had halted due to the conflict, but was about to resume: * One of these Gardner photographs, On the Great Plains, Kansas, 294 miles west of Missouri River (seen top-right), shows the attraction of the limestone-capped ridge what would draw the attention of future geologists and industrialists, two of whom would eventually create Yocemento there. Notable in the picture is the military escort in the foreground, detached from the 38th Infantry Regiment, reflecting the hostilities with the Cheyenne and allies in those months. Then based in Hays City (5 miles behind the photographer), Buffalo Bill passed over the distant Hog Back on his first hunting contracts. Major Armes had crossed this ridge just weeks before in mid-August with companies of the 10th Cavalry (negro) and the 18th Kansas Volunteer Cavalry (including ex- Confederates) to patrol the surveyed course of the railroad, there engaging large forces of Cheyenne. No construction is visible in this image even though as seen in another Gardner image, the end of track is only a short distance behind the camera. * Another of the photographs taken near the location is the more famous image that Gardner entitled Westward The Course of Empire Takes Its Way. Taken days before the signing of the Medicine Lodge Treaty (wherein the tribes had consented to permit the railroad) the image shows a construction party at end-of-track, which was then only a couple miles west of Hays City. By the time of these photographs (mid/late-October, 1867) Rome had been largely abandoned in favor of the permanent settlement of Hays City. Robert Benecke's 1873 photo of the Yocemento bluff, then named Hog Back. 2016 reenactment of the Robert Benecke photo. =The railroad comes through= The late-August and September battles on the Saline River, Solomon Forks, and tributaries of the Republican River ended the conflict west of the end of line for 1867. With the course of the railroad secured by the U. S. Army and the late-October signing of the Medicine Lodge Treaty, construction of the tracks west of Hays to Park's Fort resumed over the winter of 1867‚Äì1868, reaching that pump station before hostilities resumed in April 1868. By the end of 1868, the hostilities in western Kansas had concluded and track had reached Sheridan. By 1870, track had reached Denver. The Kansas Pacific promoted settlement, outdoor sport, and tourism in Kansas and Colorado. Ellis had been founded and by 1873 had a Railway Hotel and roundhouse built of Fort Hays Limestone from the bluffs. Photographing these and other features of the rail line, Robert Benecke also photographed the Hog Back between Hays City and Ellis. Invited to Rome by Buffalo Bill and anticipating the roles Western Kansas farmland and the railroad would play in hard wheat production, I. M. Yost arrived in Hays in 1877 and built the region's first flour mill at the Rome site. = Unsuitable for wheat farming = Hays City and Ellis were founded in 1867 and 1870, respectively. However, as fertile as the valley was, the Hog Back ridge of limestone and chalk between the two settlements was considered unsuitable for wheat farming and was initially rejected by immigrant settlers. By 1910, the local press referred to the hill as the \\"long neglected\\" Hog Back. Much of these hilltops remain largely in pasture today. = Frontier geologists = Early frontier geologists were drawn to the monumental limestone bluffs in this location and the chalk exposures beyond. The original interest was in the mapping and study of Cretaceous fossils, this general area of the state becoming a part of the broader focus of the Bone Wars. F. V. Hayden studied the site in 1871. At the time, Big Creek was undercutting the face the bluff, exposing of \\"Benton Shale\\" normally covered by grass on other slopes. Yocemento and the Hog Back; exposed Fort Hays Limestone and Benton Shale can be seen north on Interstate 70. = U.S. Portland Cement Company = The United States Portland Cement Company was founded by partners Erasmus Haworth and I. M. Yost: I. M. Yost's plan of the Yocemento townsite near the mill under construction. * Erasmus Haworth was the first state geologist of Kansas, working out of the Kansas Geological Survey at the University of Kansas. He previously had been frustrated in Ellis County, unable to dissuade the 1890s gold rush hoax in the adjoining southern corners of Ellis and Trego Counties about south and west of present Yocemento (see Smoky Hill City and Chetolah). Accurately predicting the discovery of oil at the Yocemento site, he was later known as the \\"father of oil\\" in western Kansas. * I. M. Yost was a long-standing miller in Hays; a leading businessman not only of that community, but of early 1900s western Kansas. In the 1870s, he built the first of the flour mills that dotted the \\"Great American Desert\\" by the first decades of the 20th century. In 1906, Erasmus Haworth was revising and enlarging his first geological map of Kansas and sought a guide for the area, saying years later, \\"I had heard of Ike Yost, I wanted to meet the man. I knew he had been in Hays many years and thought he would give me some pointers on topography of the country. Fort Hays LimestoneTogether, the two climbed the high bluff on a south bend of Big Creek and took in the scene. Riding back to Hays, Haworth pitched the idea of a cement plant at that bluff. He thought this could be the site of the most profitable cement mill in the state; only gravity would be needed to move the limestone from the top of the bluff to a mill in the valley. Yost saw that with no capital investment ample water was to be found in the creek and the transcontinental railroad passing through the site could bring in fuel and ship out cement as far as either coast without freight transfer. Yost also observed that they could leverage the largest industry in western Kansas by founding an adjoining town and selling the lots. The partners soon founded the United States Portland Cement Company and began selling stock, Yost selling a third of the shares. The town of Yocemento (a portmanteau of Yost and cement) was platted in 1907. A post office opened that same year. rightConstruction of the mill began in 1907. Freeborn Engineering and Construction Co. of Kansas City, Mo. were the engineers and contractors for the plant. First, a gravity-worked cable lift and then a trolley were installed to lower limestone from the quarry to the mill. By mid-1908, the mill was operational, and the town included a general store, hotel, and restaurant. Many local residents employed at the mill were ethnic Hungarians who had constructed a Catholic church at the site. The mill initially operated at a small profit and the product's test strength was as good as any of the best cements. Cement produced in Yocemento was used to build the Kansas City Union Station (then second-largest in the country) and to pave the Denver Tramway. The Kansas City Union Station was built with cement made in Yocemento. Sale of cement to these projects was in competition with the established cement syndicates of Kansas City and Denver. It was locally perceived that these concerns then \\"ganged up\\" on the Yocemento mill to force it out of business. In particular, the Denver interests (Boettcher Company) pressured the Union Pacific to not service Yocemento with Colorado coal. Denied affordable coal, the plains cement mills were able to make use of oil, newly produced in eastern Kansas and Oklahoma. A penny postcard photograph shows three large oil tanks at the Yocemento cement mill. Blue Hill Shale, also quarried at Yocemento for the silica component of Portland cement. Missouri cement plants undercut market prices and railroads applied surcharges to the plains cement mills. In 1911, U. S. Portland Cement Co. filed complaint with the ICC for relief from a perceived arbitrary rail freight surcharge of around 3 cents per hundredweight of cement compared to the lower cement shipping rates charged to manufactures in Missouri (between Kansas City and St. Louis). This complaint was joined by several other cement manufactures in the open plains of Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Montana, Texas, and Utah. However, the ICC ruled no evidence of overt shipping overcharge except in the case of Oklahoma. The ICC stated that the cement businesses complaining of excessive shipping charges were in fact suffering from their over-production of cement and the diminishing supply of cheap natural gas used to make the cement. Remaining cement mill structures.The mill began losing money and Yost and Haworth had to relinquish control, the company going into bankruptcy a few years later. In March 1916, John Kernan Mullen bought the company for $165,000 in a sheriff's sale. The millionaire flour miller of Denver, who held the first mortgage of the Yocemento mill, bought the facility with the intent to \\"put the mill in shape and start running it again\\". In 1917, the Boettcher Company then bought the mill and promptly dismantled it, arguing the plant's remoteness from fuel sources and cement markets made the company nonviable. With the mill closed, residents began to leave the community. The post office closed as well. In 1931, the church building was moved to Buckeye Township for use as a community hall. I. M. Yost moved to Kansas City, then to Denver, and later to California, but remained interested in Hays, returning a few times. Erasmus Haworth did not return to Ellis County until 1923, then to survey the Yocemento area for oil. Midland Marketing Co-op elevator and bulk chemical warehouse.Today, Yocemento is the location of a grain elevator and bulk fertilizer and chemical warehouse operated by Midland Marketing farmer's cooperative. There are a number of homes, most built long after the closure of the mill. A few of the concrete walls and foundations of the mill remain, parts of which have been remodeled into family homes. = Hydrocarbon production = While developing the cement mill, Erasmus Haworth commented that oil would be discovered someday in the anticline he discovered in the area. In 1923, a few years after the mill had closed, Haworth returned to the area just a few miles northwest of Yocemento to drill for oil. His company drilled only one dry hole and then abandoned the effort because of a drop in oil prices. Fortunately for the county and state, later exploration by others proved Haworth correct; his one well had been drilled right between two of the largest producing oil pools in Kansas. At times over the following decades, Ellis County ranked as the top oil producing county in Kansas. = Railroad realignment = Viewing the site today, an abandoned railroad alignment may be seen south of the present county highway, with the original highway alignment lying to the north in the old townsite. The original alignment of the railroad was cut across the slump blocks that had slid from the slope into the creek, which was undercutting the bluff. Slumping is characteristic on bluffs of the Fort Hays Escarpment, where the deep Carlile Shale weathers away but is unable to support high, steep slopes. As seen in the Benecke photograph of the treeless Hog Back, this slump formed a narrow terrain between the deep banks of Big Creek and the steep slope of the bluff. The blocks of the slump obstructed wagon traffic west from Fort Hays, which found routes over the Hog Back further south. The railroad, however, was able to cut a roadbed through the slumping. Unfortunately, the slump was not stable and the railroad repeatedly repaired the shifting roadbed over the decades. By the early 1900s, railroad surveyors considered tunneling through the Hogback. Eventually, the railroad drove many pilings into the bank (still visible from the highway), but failed to stabilize the roadbed. In 1951‚Äì52, Union Pacific straightened the alignment of the tracks to cut across the bow of Big Creek though the abandoned townsite, also cutting a new channel for the creek about to the north. The portion of original creek channel at the base of the bluff remains, water still occasionally ponding where Benecke's sportsmen fished in 1873. Parallel highway and railroad track west out of Yocemento; old track was at the base of the bluff at left, old highway was behind the trees at right. = Highway realignment = From the first settlement, wagon travel up the line west of Fort Hays meant either crossing and driving north of Big Creek or crossing over the top of the Hog Back to the south. As noted above, the ground was too rough at the base of the bluff at Big Creek for wagon traffic; moreover, that passage was occupied by the railroad early on. The first public road constructed from Hays to Yocemento, originally named \\"Yocemento Road\\", was built expressly to connect Hays economically with the expected cement boom at Yocemento. Extending from 12th Street at Hays, the road crossed Big Creek along the old Main Street of Rome and continued along the north of the track to Yocemento. Over 1915‚Äì1916, the Ellis County government extended the Yocemento Road to Ellis to complete the county's segment of the Kansas City- Denver Golden Belt Road though the county. The extension started at the section line where the St. Agnes Church stood, running straight west along Third Street (see Yost's plan above) to cross the track; from that crossing, it ran along the south of the track through Ellis. Much of the Golden Belt Road became U.S. Route 40 in 1926, thus the earliest road from Hays \\"through the heart\\" of Yocemento was the only segment of the original \\"Highway 40\\" alignment between Wilson and Wallace to run along the north side of the Kansas Pacific tracks, making two grade crossings to do so. Due to the inconvenience and accidents at the west crossing, this matter was eventually corrected. The problem the railroad was having with the tracks at Yocemento also created an opportunity to improve the Federal highway there. When the railroad moved the tracks well away from the landslide area (1951‚Äì52) the new Highway 40 section was also built south of the tracks from a new bridge across Big Creek at Hays to the old crossing just west of Yocemento. The old highway north of the track is now maintained by the county, and is now named Noose Road, running from near the old crossing and passing through Yocemento, and miles on passing Hangman's Bridge as it enters Hays. Geography Yocemento is at (38.9072335, -99.4239958) at an elevation of . It is south of Interstate 70 and west- northwest of Hays, the county seat. Yocemento lies across the banks of Big Creek on the eastern edge of the Chalk Hills area of the Smoky Hills region of the Great Plains.  Media  The town's newspaper, Yocemento Star, was edited by Frank Motz, then little more than a boy; but, later founder of the Hays Daily News. Transportation = Rail = The Kansas Pacific (KP) line of the Union Pacific Railroad runs southeast-northwest through Yocemento, with a spur for the grain elevator and bulk supplies. = Highways = Yocemento Avenue approaching the old mill buildings from the south. * Old Hwy 40 (RS 1977) (parallel to and south of the railroad tracks, an old alignment of U.S. Route 40) runs southeast-northwest through Yocemento between the old cement plant and quarry to the south and the grain elevator and remainder of the village to the north.

Ann Hall has been described as the most successful miniature painter active in early nineteenth-century New York, renowned for her engaging portraits, especially of children and young brides.McCabe Although many of her compositions strike modern audiences as sentimental,Rubinstein, p. 43. her popularity during her lifetime and the significance of her career are attested by the high prices paid for her miniatures (often five hundred dollars per commission) and her election to the National Academy of Design, New York.Ellet, p. 300. She has been credited for inspiring a renaissance in the technique of painting miniatures on ivory in the United States. Early life Hall was born in Pomfret, Connecticut, the sixth of eleven surviving children of Jonathan (or John) Hall, a prominent physician, and his wife, the former Bathesheba Mumford.Rubinstein, p. 42. Her considerable artistic talent was encouraged by her family and at a young age she was experimenting with several different techniques, including cutting silhouettes, modeling figures in wax, and executing flower pictures and still lifes in watercolor and pencil.Dunlap, p. 161.

There she learned to sketch and paint in oil and make miniatures in watercolors on ivory from the Samuel King, one of the teachers of Gilbert Stuart.Larned, pp. 216-217. In about 1808, Hall traveled to New York City to study oil painting with Alexander Robertson. During her tenure in his studio, she viewed the temporary exhibition of old master paintings from the collection of Colonel John Trumbull, painter and private secretary to John Jay, which had been amassed when Trumbull was active in London and Paris. Hall also studied the old masters in the collection of her brother Charles Henry Hall, a businessman who frequently traveled to Europe and acquired a group of watercolors, portrait miniatures, and oil paintings while abroad, including a series of copies after original compositions by Italian masters such as Tintoretto and Guido Reni.Kort, Sonneborn, p. 90. As Charlotte Streifer Rubinstein has observed, what has been described by critics as the \\"glowing 'old master' color\\" of her miniatures resulted from her close study of early modern art. Her interest in old master painting also inspired her to adapt complex multi-figured compositional elements derived from European religious paintings to group portraits; as one of her early biographers noted, her portraits of children resembled \\"elegant and well- arranged bouquet[s].\\"Dunlap, p. 162.

She was not encouraged to take an active role in the governance of the institution, however, and never appeared at Academy meetings except on one occasion when her presence was requested to meet a quorum.Rubinstein, p. 43. Yet she continued to exhibit in the institution's annual exhibitions until 1852, and a popular engraving produced by E. Gallaudet was made after Hall's miniature of Garafilia Mohalbi. Mohalbi had been captured at the age of seven by the Turks during the Greek War of IndependenceMetropolitan Museum, Barratt, p. 133. and was ransomed by an American merchant who had her brought to Boston in 1827 to be raised with his family.Hale, pp. 431-432. Mohalbi died in 1830 at the age of 13. She had a studio on the top floor of her sister's house and mostly made portraits of women and children. Her clients were wealthy residents of New York who paid her up to $500 per commission.

Death Hall never married and died at the age of seventy-one in her sister's house, which became known as the Henry Hall Ward Mansion during the lifetime of Eliza's son. It is estimated that Hall left her heirs an estate of $100,000, a fortune earned solely through commissions.

Malena, at this time, has married Fernando (Mat√≠as Desiderio), with whom she had a son, Tom√°s. But Fernando fled eight months ago from their lives, due to gambling debts he contracted and led him to suffer threats.

Papis), it is aired in episodes of half an hour. Sebasti√°n Estevanez commented that short episodes may be inadvisable for the early stages of a telenovela, when it is trying to establish the story and attract an audience, whereas Avenida Brasil may suffer less from it because it was airing their last ones. Carina Zampini commented that the production was asking for episodes of a complete hour. Avenida Brasil ended the Argentine airing on July 7, and Camino al Amor was expanded to a full hour after that.

Crime and arrest  Holmes, a black man originally from Chicago, Illinois, murdered a farmer, 55-year-old Thomas Tillery, on April 3, 1931 by shooting him with two accomplices, Walter Dewberry and Charles Rodgers. The trio had been on a crime spree across Kentucky committing a series of robberies and assaults in Louisville, Fulton County, and some sections of southern Illinois.Reference 3 When first apprehended, they tried to claim that the three of them committed a robbery while an unknown man fired the shot that murdered Tillery, but no such man was ever found, and only Holmes, Rodgers, and Dewberry went to court.  Trial  The trial began on April 28, 1931, amid great racial tension. Dewberry's black attorney was beaten by a mob that felt angered by Dewberry's choice of a black civil rights attorney over a white court-appointed attorney; Dewberry's attorney requested a change of venue because of the violent atmosphere, but this was denied, and on May 3, 1931, Holmes, Dewberry, and Rodgers all received death sentences for their crimes. The executions of the three convicts were scheduled for April 29, 1932, but Dewberry was given a stay of execution, so on that date, only Holmes and Rodgers were executed.  Execution  Walter Holmes was 31 years old when he was executed on the same night as his accomplice, 23-year-old Charles Rodgers, and another man, 23-year-old A.B. Cooksey, who was put to death for a completely unrelated murder of Police Chief John Ashby from Madisonville. The executions took place in the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville, where Kentucky's electric chair was located. While Cooksey and Rodgers were described as having gone to their deaths calmly and without incidence,Reference 7 Holmes did not. The day before the execution, Holmes had caused trouble for prison staff; he stabbed a guard with a homemade knife. On the day of the execution, after Cooksey and Rodgers had been executed, when guards went to Holmes's cell to take him to the execution chamber, he threw water on them.Reference 1 Then he brandished an iron pipe that he had broken off of a water pipeline and threatened the guards with it. After 90 minutes, the warden ordered the guards to throw tear gas bombs at Holmes.

The Warangal Fort has four ornamental gates which originally formed the gates to the destroyed great Shiva temple which are known as Kakatiya Kala Thoranam or Warangal Gates. The architectural feature of these historical arches of the Warangal Fort has been adopted as the symbol of the Kakatiya Dynasty and has been officially incorporated as the Emblem of Telangana for the state of Telangana. These gates or arches in the Warangal Fort are said to have similarities with gateways of the Sanchi stupa; this fact has been endorsed by many. The arch was built around 12th century during the rule of the Kakatiya dynasty. The Monument was included in the \\"tentative list\\" of UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Monument was submitted by the Permanent Delegation of India to UNESCO on 10/09/2010. History Kakatiya Kala Thoranam (Warangal Gate) and Ruins The Kakatiya Kala Thoranam, or arch, is an extensive ornamented stone sculpture; reflective of four identical gates in the Warangal Fort, which was part of the great Swayambhusiva temple of Shiva in the fort built by Ganapati Deva (1199-1262) during the 12th century. His daughter Rudrama Devi and Pratap Rudra II of the Kakatiya Dynasty added more fortifications to the fort which was laid in three concentric circles. The four gateways (charkamou) were part of the temple which was destroyed by the Muslim invader Ulugh Khan during the 1323 invasion, as a part of their policy followed after their victories over territories, to desecrate Hindu temples. The great temple of which the gates were integral is said to be comparable to the size and splendor of the Rudra Mahalaya Temple at Siddhpur in Gujarat. Features A depiction of the arch forms the main symbol in the Emblem of Telangana for the state of Telangana. This logo or emblem, in English, Telugu and Urdu is portrayed with a combination of green and gold, representing \\"Bangaru Telangana\\" (meaning: \\"Golden Telangana\\"). Also inscribed on the logo are the names of the Government of Telangana in English, and as \\"Telangana Prabhutvam\\" in Telugu and as \\"Telangana Sarkar\\" in Urdu. At the base of the logo there is an inscription in Sanskrit which says \\"Satyameva Jayate\\" (meaning: Truth shall triumph). The central part of the fort, identified as the archaeological zone, contains the ruins of the great Swayambhusiva temple, now seen with only the free-standing \\"Entrance Portals\\", or gates on the four sides, all being similar in design. Each gate has twin pillars with angled brackets over which lies the huge lintel; the height of this gate being . The gates have extensive intricate carvings of \\"lotus buds, looped garlands, mythical animals, and birds with foliated tails\\". They do not depict any religious symbols, said to be the reason for its preserved condition for not being destroyed by Muslim invaders. The gates at the northern and southern ends are apart. The eastern and western gates are at a distance of apart.

From 862 onwards the counts of Flanders were among the original twelve peers of the Kingdom of France. For centuries their estates around the cities of Ghent, Bruges and Ypres formed one of the most affluent regions in Europe. Up to 1477, the area under French suzerainty was located west of the Scheldt River and was called \\"Royal Flanders\\" (Dutch: Kroon-Vlaanderen, French: Flandre royale). Aside from this, the counts of Flanders from the 11th century onward also held land east of the river as a fief of the Holy Roman Empire, an area called \\"Imperial Flanders\\" (Rijks-Vlaanderen or Flandre imp√©riale). Part of the Burgundian Netherlands from 1384, the county was finally removed from French to Imperial control after the Peace of Madrid in 1526 and the Peace of the Ladies in 1529. In 1795, the remaining territory within the Austrian Netherlands was incorporated by the French First Republic and passed to the newly established United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815. The former County of Flanders, except for French Flanders, is the only part of the medieval French kingdom that is not part of modern-day France.  Etymology  Flanders and Flemish (Dutch: Vlaanderen, Vlaams) are likely derived from the Frisian *flƒÅndra and *flƒÅmisk (in Old Frisian flamsk), the roots of which are Germanic *flaumaz meaning \\"overflow, flooding\\". The coastal area of Flanders was flooded twice per day from the 3rd century to the 8th century by the North Sea at the time when the coast was frequently visited by Frisian (cattle) traders and probably largely inhabited by Frisians. The Flemish people are first mentioned in the biography of Saint Eligius (ca. 590‚Äì660), the Vita sancti Eligii. This work was written before 684, but only known since 725. This work mentions the \\"Flanderenses\\", who lived in \\"Flandris.\\"  Geography  Topographic map of the county of Flanders at the end of the 14th century, the French-Imperial border marked in red The geography of the historic County of Flanders only partially overlaps with present-day region of Flanders in Belgium, though even there it extends beyond West Flanders and East Flanders. Some of the historic county is now part of France and the Netherlands. The land covered by the county is spread out over: * Belgium: ** two of the five Flemish provinces: West-Flanders and East-Flanders ** part of the Flemish province of Antwerp: the land of Bornem ** part of the Walloon province of Hainaut: Tournaisis and the region around Moeskroen (that belonged to West- Flanders until 1962) * France: ** French Flanders (in the Nord departement) *** the French westcorner: the region around Dunkirk, Bergues and Bailleul, an area where Flemish used to be the main language *** Walloon Flanders, where the Picard language, closely related to French, was spoken. ** Artois (in the Pas-de-Calais department): removed from Flanders in 1191 and created as independent county in 1237 * Netherlands: ** Zeelandic Flanders, a region between Belgium and the Western Scheldt in the southern part of the modern province of Zeeland, which from 1581 formed part of the Generality Lands under control of the Dutch Republic.  Flag and arms  Philip II's coronation. The count of Flanders was one of the 12 ancient Peers or \\"equals\\" of the King of France. (1455 panel painting by Jean Fouquet). The arms of the County of Flanders were allegedly created by Philip of Alsace, count of Flanders from 1168 to 1191; a climbing or rampant black lion on a gold field. In the story about the Battle of the Golden Spurs, the arms and its corresponding battlecry Vlaendr'n den leeuw (\\"Flanders, the Lion!\\") plays a crucial role in the forming of a Flemish consciousness, which was popularised in recent times by the book De Leeuw van Vlaanderen by Hendrik Conscience. As a result, the arms of the county live on as arms of the Flemish Community. It is said that Philip of Alsace brought the lion flag with him from the Holy Land, where in 1177 he supposedly conquered it from a Saracen knight, but this is a myth. The simple fact that the lion appeared on his personal seal since 1163, when he had not yet set one step in the Levant, disproves it. In reality Philip was following a West-European trend. In the same period lions also appeared in the arms of Brabant, Luxembourg, Holland, Limburg and other territories. It is curious that the lion as a heraldic symbol was mostly used in border territories and neighbouring countries of the Holy Roman Empire. It was in all likelihood a way of showing independence from the emperor, who used an eagle in his personal arms. In Europe the lion had been a well-known figure since Roman times, through works such as the fables of Aesop.  History  = Prehistory and antiquity = The future county of Flanders had been inhabited since prehistory. During the Iron Age the Kemmelberg formed an important Celtic settlement. During the times of Julius Caesar, the inhabitants were part of the Belgae, a collective name for all Celtic and Germanic tribes in the north of Gallia. For Flanders in specific these were the Menapii, the Morini, the Nervii and the Atrebates. Julius Caesar conquered the area around 54 BC and the population was partially romanised from the 1st to the 3rd century. The Roman road that connected Cologne with Boulogne-sur-Mer was used as a defense perimeter. In the south the Gallo-Romanic population was able to maintain itself, while the north became a no-mans land that also suffered from regular floods from the North Sea. In the coastal and Scheldt areas Saxon tribes gradually appeared. For the Romans, Saxon was a general term, and included Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Erules. The coastal defense around Boulogne and Oudenburg, the Litus Saxonicum, remained functional until about 420. These forts were manned by Saxon soldiers. From their base land Toxandria the Salian Franks further expanded into the Roman empire. The first incursion into the lands of the Atrebates was turned away in 448 at Vicus Helena. But after the murder of the Roman general Flavius A√´tius in 454 and Roman emperor Valentinianus III in 455, the Salic Franks encountered hardly any resistance. From Duisburg, king Chlodio conquered Cambrai and Tournai, and he reached the Somme. After his death two Salic kingdoms emerged. Childeric is recorded in 463 as king of Tournay and ally of the Romans against the Visigoths. He was also administrator of the province of Belgica Secunda. His son Clovis I conquered from 486 on all of Northern France. = Middle Ages = The abandoned coast and Scheldt region had been partially repopulated since the 4th century by Saxons and Franks from the east of the Rhine that retained their Germanic culture and language. In the 5th century Salic Franks settled in present-day Northern-France and Wallonia, primarily around the cities of Courtrai, Tournai and Bavay. They adapted to the local Gallo-Romanic population. From the 6th century on the no-mans-land farther north was filled by Franks from the Rhinelands and other Germanic groups from the Netherlands and Germany. The first wave of immigration in the present day Flemish territory was accompanied by limited Christianisation. In the wake of the immigrants, missionaries tried to convert the heathen population, but had little success. The bishoprics were reinstated, usually with the same natural borders of the Late-Roman era; the Silva Carbonaria separated the Bishopric of Cambrai from the Bishopric of Tongeren, while the Scheldt again became the border between the bishoprics of Cambrai and Tournai. Vedast and Eleutherius of Tournai were assigned to reinstate the bishoprics of Arras and Tournai. However, these bishoprics failed to survive independently. In the late 6th century the bishopric of Arras was connected to that of Cambrai, and at the start of the 7th century the same was done to the bishoprics of Tournai and Noyon. At the end of the 6th century the duchy of Dentelinus was created in the north of what would later constitute Neustria. This duchy presumably included the bishoprics Boulogne, Th√©rouanne, Arras, Tournai, Cambrai and Noyon, thus the northwestern region between the North Sea and the Silva Carbonaria, an area whose outlines were very similar to the later Flanders. The duchy of Dentelinus was primarily meant as a military and strategical deterrent against Frisian and Saxon invasions. It was a cornerstone in the military defense of the Merovingian Empire. In 600 Chlothar II (584‚Äì628) was forced to temporarily cede the duchy of Dentelinus to Austrasia, but after restoration of Austrasian dual-monarchy in 622/623 the duchy was returned. = 7th century = Pagi i.e. \\"shires\\" of Flanders, reunion of the former marquisate of Flanders, showing all the lands subsequently reclaimed from the sea. At the end of the 6th and the 7th century a new inflow emerged from the western Pas-de-Calais. This area had been germanised in the 5th century and descendants of the Saxons and Franks had settled in future Flanders and the Duchy of Brabant. New groups of germanic settlers also came in from the Netherlands and Germany. Their new settlements often received the name of their germanic leader, with '-inga haim' added. -Inga haim meant 'the settlement of the tribe of X'. For example: Petegem comes from Petta-inga- haim, which meant 'the settlement of the tribe of Petta'. The colonisation and germanisation of Flanders took place primarily in the 6th and 7th centuries. In the 7th century the population-level had risen sufficiently to start rebuilding the religious, military and administrative infrastructure. In the area of linguistics, the situation stabilised so that a large, bilingual region with a linear language border could emerge in the 8th century. In Pas- de-Calais, which had been densely populated a long time, a language barrier had emerged in the 6th‚Äì7th century, but in the 9th century a romanisation- movement started that has continued until the present day. The Christianisation attempts in the 6th century by bishops like Eleutherius and Vedast had largely failed. Thus, in the 8th century a different strategy was chosen. A new Christianisation attempt was made under influence from king Dagobert I. He appointed several devoted missionaries from the southern parts of his kingdom to his royal domains in the northern parts of his kingdom. The missionaries were tasked with founding monasteries and abbeys there, that were to serve as centers of Christianity in a pagan region. From these centers, the conversion of the local populace could be started. In 649 Audomar founded an abbey at Sithiu (the Abbey of Saint Bertin) and in 680 Aubertus founded the Abbey of St. Vaast near Arras. The Christianisation of the population was mainly the work of missionaries like Amandus (St. Bavo's Abbey and St. Peter's Abbey in Ghent) and Eligius (coastal region and Antwerp). In his 'vita', Eligius makes the first mention of the word 'Flanders', when he toured the area around 650. During the 7th century the first Gaue or pagi were created in the Flemish territories. Gaue were administrative subdivisions of the civitates. The Gaue from the 7th and 8th century would form the basis of the county of Flanders. The pagus Tornacensis dates from ca. 580, and from the 7th century we know of the 'pagus Cambracinsis' in 663, the pagus Taroanensis from 649 and the pagus Bracbatensis at the end of the century. From the 8th century we know of the pagus Rodaninsis from 707, the pagus Gandao from the first quarter of the 8th century, the pagus Mempiscus from 723 and the pagus Flandrensis from around 745. Lastly, the pagus Austrebatensis and the pagus Curtracensis are also counted as Merovingian gaue. = Carolingians = The 10th-century County of Flanders next to Lotharingia. In 751 the Carolingian Mayors of the Palace succeeded in removing the Merovingians from power and obtaining the throne for themselves. The last Merovingian king, Childeric III, was placed in captivity at the later Abbey of Saint Bertinus in St. Omer, and his long hair, a symbol of royal power, was cut off. Charlemagne succeeded his father Pepin the Short in Neustria and Austrasia, and after the death of his brother Karloman he was able to reunite the entire Frankish Empire. Though he resided in Aachen, he spent much time travelling through his territories. In 811 he inspected the fleet that he had ordered built in Boulogne and Ghent, to protect against Viking invasions. The region comprising future Flanders was, from an economic point of view, a flourishing region, with a series of ports along the Scheldt river: Ghent, Tournai, Valenciennes, Cambrai and Lambres at Douai on the Scarpe and a number of seaports: Quentovic, Boulogne and Is√®re portus, a port at the mouth of the Yser. Moreover, the region included a number of rich abbeys, such as Abbey of Saint Bertin, Saint Bavo's Abbey, Saint-Amand Abbey and the Abbey of St. Vaast. Charlemagne was succeeded by his son Louis the Pious. Even during Louis' life his three sons started fighting over his heritage. They eventually concluded multiple treaties, of which the Treaty of Verdun, signed in 843, would be the definitive treaty. These treaties created East Francia, Middle Francia and West Francia. West Francia, inherited by Charles the Bald, included the original county of Flanders, that spanned roughly between Oudenburg, Aardenburg and Torhout. After the Middle- Frankish kings died out, the rulers of the West and East-Frankish Kingdoms divided the Middle-Frankish kingdom amongst themselves in the treaty of Meerssen in 870. Now Western Europe had been divided into two sides: the solid West Francia (the later France) and the loose confederation of principalities of East Francia, that would become the Holy Roman Empire. In the north these two powers were separated by the Scheldt river, which had previously separated West Francia from Middle Francia. This separation remained unchanged until the times of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. = Growth in the 9th, 10th and 11th centuries (864‚Äì1071) = Institution of Baldwin I, the first count of Flanders by Charles the Bald, the Frankish king. Militarily, economically and politically, Europe went through a deep crisis. The Vikings invaded from the north, the Magyar from the east and the Saracens from the south. All left trails of destruction. The central authorities of the two Frankish kingdoms were unable to organise an effective defensive, causing the population to lose faith and trust in their far-removed rulers. In the wake of this power vacuum, local powerful individuals saw their chance. Often these individuals were the descendants of people associated with Charlemagne. The county of Flanders originated from the Gau of Pagus Flandrensis, led by the Forestiers dynasty, who had been appointed by Charlemagne, who had made a small contribution by uniting small feudal territories in the higher parts of the Flemish Valley. The forestiers dynasty also strengthened the hold of the church on the relatively desolate area. The first Margrave(Count) of Flanders was Baldwin I, who became count in 862, and a romantic anecdote is connected to this: Baldwin eloped with the daughter of the Frankish king Charles the Bald, Judith of West Francia. Judith, who had previously been married to two English kings, refused her father's command to return to him. After mediation by the pope, the Frankish king reconciled with his son-in-law, and gave him the title of margrave, and the corresponding feudal territories as dowry. Margrave was primarily a military appointment and some versions of the story theorize that King Charles made Baldwin Margrave in the hope that he would be killed by the Vikings. Initially the French kings meant to secure the safety of the northern French border from Viking invasions with this act. The counts, however, made good use of the crisis situation by incorporating the surrounding plundered territories into the county. The counts expanded the influence of the original Flemish pagus over the years over all territories south and west of the Scheldt river, including presentday the lordship of the Four Amts, Zeelandic Flanders, the burgraviate of Aalst to the east and the County of Artois to the south, which remained part of Flanders until it became a separate county in 1237. After that date, the county of Artois at various times still came under the dominion of the count of Flanders as a separate title, until it was absorbed by the French crown. = Prosperity in the 12th and 13th century (1071‚Äì1278) = The Gravensteen at Ghent, Built by Philip of Alsace The House of Flanders remained in power until 1119, when Baldwin VII of Flanders died heirless, and the county was inherited by Charles the Good, of the House of Denmark. He abandoned the title \\"Marquis of Flanders\\", which had been used alongside the comital style since the tenth century. The counts of Flanders were the last French lords using the title marquis, which would not be used again in France until 1504.D'Arcy Jonathan D. Boulton, \\"Marquis/Marquisate\\", Medieval France: An Encyclopedia (Taylor & Francis, 1995), 1120. After a short interlude under William Clito of Normandy (1127 to 1128), the county went to Thierry of Alsace of the House of Alsace. Under Thierry (1128‚Äì1168) and his successor Philip of Alsace, Flanders' importance and power increased. In the second half of the 12th century, the county went through a period of great prosperity when Philip of Alsace managed to incorporate the County of Vermandois into Flanders through the inheritance of his wife. The territories he controlled now came to within 25 kilometers of Paris, and were larger than the territories his feudal lord, the French king, directly controlled. During the rule of the House of Alsace, cities developed and new institutions were formed. The ports of Gravelines, Nieuwpoort, Damme, Biervliet, Dunkirk, and Mardijk were founded, as well as Calais by Philip's brother Matthew of Alsace. Aside from colonisation, the ports also functioned to reduce the silting of the Aa, Yser and Zwin rivers, which were endangering the accessibility of Saint-Omer, Ypres and Bruges. Biervliet also served as a counter to Hollandic influence. Map of Flanders and Hainault after comtesse Jeanne de Constantinople (1200‚Äì1244) Trade partners included England, the Baltic countries and France over sea, and the Rhineland and Italy over land. The wool trade with England was of special importance to the rising cloth industry in Flanders. The wealth of many Flemish cities (as their Belltowers and cloth halls testify) came from the drapery industry. Aside from this, the grain trade with England and through Holland with Hamburg were also important. Saint-Omer became the most important transit-port for French wine in the 12th century. These were the centuries of the breakthrough of the Flemish merchants, with their trade with England, the Baltic area and South-West France, as well as the landroutes to the Rhineland and Italy, though later only the yearly fairs of Champagne. Flanders' flourishing trading towns made it one of the most urbanised parts of Europe. In 1194, Baldwin I of Constantinople of the House of Hainaut, succeeded the House of Alsace. = The crisis of the 14th century (1278‚Äì1384) = In 1278 Guy of Dampierre, of the House of Dampierre, became count of Flanders. The king of France wanted to definitively conquer Flanders, and started the Franco-Flemish War (1297‚Äì1305). Increasingly powerful in the 12th century, the territory's autonomous urban centres were instrumental in defeating the French invasion attempt, defeating the French at the Battle of the Golden Spurs in 1302. But finally the French prevailed at the battle of Mons-en-P√©v√®le and with the subsequent treaty of Athis-sur-Orge (1305) Flanders lost Lille, Douai, and Orchies to France and had to pay exorbitant fines but retained their independence as a fief of the French kingdom. During this period, Flanders experienced a period of relative prosperity with its strong cloth industry and diverse artwork. Trade in Flanders was so extensive that statues of the Madonna and Child were made in Flanders with ivory, which was only accessible on the Indian Ocean trade networks. Lucas d'Heere in the 2nd half of the 16th century. Preserved in the Ghent University Library. Flemish prosperity waned in the following century, however, owing to widespread European population decline following the Black Death of 1348, the disruption of trade during the Anglo-French Hundred Years' War (1338‚Äì1453), and increased English cloth production. Flemish weavers had gone over to Worstead and North Walsham in Norfolk in the 12th century and established the wool industry. = The Burgundian 15th century (1384‚Äì1506) = Wijnendale Castle with a view of the 15th-century part Through his marriage with Margaret of Dampierre in 1369, Philip the Bold, duke of Burgundy, made an end to the independence of Flanders. Flanders became the possession of the House of Valois-Burgundy, that ruled over the Burgundian State. In 1449 the city of Ghent revolted against duke Philip the Good. In 1453 Philip crushed the rebels at the battle of Gavere, ending the revolt. The cities of Ghent and Bruges had previously operated virtually as city-states, and upon the death of duke Charles the Bold attempted to re-assert this position by means of the Great Privilege that they wrested from Mary of Burgundy, Charles' daughter and successor. In 1482 this last Burgundian ruler died, making her young son Philip I of Castile of the House of Habsburg the new count, and her husband Maximilian I of Austria the regent. The Flemish cities staged two more revolts, but these were ultimately subdued by the armies of the Holy Roman Empire. The 1493 Treaty of Senlis established peace between France and the Habsburgs; per the terms of the treaty, Flanders would henceforth be a territory of the Holy Roman Empire. = The seventeen provinces in the 16th century (1506‚Äì98) = Map of the county of Flanders from 1609 by Matthias Quad, cartographer, and Johannes Bussemacher, engraver and publisher, Cologne Under Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor (born in the Flemish city Ghent), Flanders became a member of the Burgundian Circle. The county was later involved in the Guelders Wars. Through the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549, the County of Flanders was officially detached from France. It became an independent territory of the Holy Roman Empire. This constitutional act made Flanders part of the Seventeen Provinces, that constituted the Low Countries and from then on would be inherited as a whole. The Low Countries held an important place in the Empire. For Charles personally, they were the region where he spent his childhood. Because of trade and industry and the rich cities, they were also important for the treasury. Lordship transferred to the Spanish branch of the House of Habsburg with Philip II of Spain, and after 1556 belonged to the Kings of Spain. It was in Steenvoorde (In French Flanders) in 1566 that the Beeldenstorm broke loose. The Beeldenstorm spread through all of the Low Countries and eventually led to the outbreak of the Eighty Years' war and the secession of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. Originally Flanders cooperated with the northern provinces as a member of the Union of Utrecht, and also signed the Act of Abjuration in 1581, but from 1579 to 1585, in the period known as the \\"Calvinist Republic of Ghent\\", it was reconquered by the Spanish army. = The Spanish 17th century (1598‚Äì1713) = Flanders stayed under Spanish control. Through the efforts of the French king Louis XIV, the entire southern part of Flanders was annexed by France, and became known as South-Flanders or French Flanders. This situation was formalised in 1678 at the Treaty of Nijmegen. = The Austrian 18th century (1713‚Äì89) = Neerwinden during the Revolutionary Wars, 1793 After the extinction of the Spanish branch of the Habsburgs, the Austrian branch of the Habsburgs became counts of Flanders. Under Maria Theresa of Austria, the Austrian Netherlands flourished. = Last years (1789‚Äì97) = In 1789 a revolution broke out against emperor Joseph II. In 1790 the county of Flanders and a separate province called West- Flanders (1713), which constituted the territories given back by France to the Emperor, were two of the founding members of the United States of Belgium. Just like the other parts of the Austrian Netherlands, the county of Flanders declared its independence. This took place on the Friday-market at Ghent on 4 January 1790. The \\"Manifest van Vlaenderen\\" was drawn up by Charles-Joseph de Graeve and Jean-Joseph Raepsaet. The county of Flanders officially ceased to exist in 1795, when it was annexed by France, and divided into two departments: Lys (present day West Flanders) and Escaut (present day East Flanders and Zeelandic Flanders). Austria confirmed its loss in the 1797 Treaty of Campo Formio. After the French Revolution the county was not restored, and instead the two departments continued their existence as the provinces of East- and West-Flanders in the Unitarian United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and later after the Belgian Revolution in Belgium.  Count of Flanders title  From 1840 onwards, the title \\"Count of Flanders\\" has been appropriated by the monarchy of Belgium. As a rule it was given to the second in line of succession to the Belgian throne. The title of count of Flanders was abolished by royal decision on 16 October 2001.

(13 July 1918 ‚Äì 27 October 1947) was a Spanish Franciscan Religious Sister who served as a missionary to Kashmir. She was murdered on the grounds of St. Joseph's Catholic Church in Baramulla by invading tribesmen during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947. She is considered the first Christian martyr in Jammu and Kashmir. Early life She was born Joaquina de Z. S√°nchez on July 13, 1918, in the village of Sondika, Biscay, called Bidegain, into a large family of seventeen children. While still an infant, her parents entrusted her upbringing to a community of the Daughters of the Cross in Bilbao. At eleven years of age she became a boarder in the teaching college in Ordu√±a run by the Sisters of the Company of Mary, Our Lady, where she volunteered until the end of her studies at the Missionary Center of Bilbao. In 1936, at the age of 18, she thought of becoming a Carmelite nun, but doing so was impossible due to the Spanish Civil War then raging in Spain. She then began to work as a nurse in the municipal hospital of Bilbao, but in May 1937 she went into exile with her family as a result of the fight, settling in Cambo-les-Bains in the southern France. While there, S√°nchez came to know the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary, a missionary religious congregation founded in India. After having read the biography of a member of the congregation, Sister Maria Assunta Pallotta, who had died in China at age 27 while nursing the sick during an outbreak of typhus, she decided to enter the congregation. Due to the illness and death of her father and other circumstances, however, she did not enter until 1940, after the family returned to Spain, where she was admitted as a candidate at the convent in Pamplona. At her admission to the novitiate of the congregation, she was given the religious name of Maria Teresalina. Missionary life Through years of religious formation and work on her nursing skills, she was preparing herself for mission work. For this she prayed that she might be like a sponge from which one could squeeze \\"even the last drop\\". After her profession of perpetual vows in the congregation, she was sent to the overseas missions with 44 other Spanish Franciscan Missionaries of Mary, fulfilling a dream that she had cherished for a long time. The group left for Kashmir on 16 April 1947. The Sisters arrived at the mission of Baramulla about 9 August 1947. Their base of operations was a convent attached to a hospital. S√°nchez began her health ministry serving the poor of the community. She provided healthcare to the local people and visited the homebound in the community. During this time she began to study English, Urdu, and Kashmir. She thrived in this situation, and was quickly appointed as the Assistant Superior. Martyrdom Shortly after their arrival, the Sisters found themselves in the middle of the Kashmir conflict: both India and Pakistan wanted possession of Kashmir because of its strategic position. Although a neutrality pact was in effect, Pakistan invaded the region anyway. The mission compound became a sanctuary for hordes of refugees fleeing the violence. Tribesmen from Northern Frontier, (what is today known as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) took advantage of the situation and attacked, wrecking everything on their passage. While heading to Srinigar, they attacked Baramulla, which was on the route to that city, where they looted the church and convent, stealing everything that appeared to be valuable. They went to the hospital and began to destroy everything inside, whereupon they met the Mother Superior. The mercenaries pulled off her eyeglasses, ring, and veil. S√°nchez interceded, speaking up for her Superior. At that moment the mercenaries shouted: \\"Kill them!\\" She put herself in front of the Superior to defend her and received three bullet wounds. The shots hit her in the lung, abdomen, and leg. The mercenaries then dragged her to a room in the hospital that had already been sacked. While the mercenaries prepared to kill the others, Major Saurab Hyat Khan, an officer in the Pakistani army, arrived and issued a counter-order. This official had been educated in a Catholic college led by the Presentation Sisters in Peshawar (he explained that he was \\"not likely to forget their [the Catholic Sisters'] kindness\\"). When Khan saw what he considered a great mistake, he asked pardon of the Sisters. As there was no possibility of attending to the wounded, the community of Sisters surrounded S√°nchez, who was quickly losing blood. Her wounds were very serious and it was not possible to save her. she endured a long agony of ten hours, losing blood \\"until the last drop\\" as her motto had stated, in acute pain that could not be alleviated due to a lack of sedatives. She only asked for help occasionally when the pain moved nearer, from her leg to her stomach. Her last words were: \\"It is already ended‚Ä¶ I offer my life for the conversion of Kashmir.\\" Two days later she received Christian burial in a grave dug in the convent garden, with no coffin.http://www.millhillmissionaries.com/assets/advocate-feb-2014-medrez.pdf Legacy Besides S√°nchez, five other people were killed by the tribesmen, both staff and patients, including a British officer and his wife, who was in labor at the time. The sacking of the Catholic mission was extensively reported in the Western press. News articles suggested that rape had taken place. The government of India publicised the attack along with its war with Pakistan. Soon after this, the Pakistani tribes were evicted from Baramulla and President Jawaharlal Nehru himself visited the mission compound. S√°nchez remains are now buried in the convent cemetery of the mission.

The Division 1 premiership was won by the Port Melbourne Football Club, after it defeated Coburg in the Grand Final on 21 September by eleven points; it was Port Melbourne's 13th Division 1 premiership, the first of three premierships won in a row between 1980 and 1982, and the fourth of six premierships won in nine seasons from 1974 until 1982. The Division 2 premiership was won by Brunswick; it was the club's second Division 2 premiership, and was won in its first season since relegation from Division 1. Rule changes The Association introduced a number of on-field and off-field rule changes in the 1980 season. =Seconds competition scheduling= For the first time, Association Seconds matches were for the first time played as curtain-raisers to Firsts matches. When the Seconds competition was established in the 1920s, scheduling was such that the Seconds played at the same time as the Firsts, with the Seconds playing at home when the Firsts played away and vice versa. In the 1960s, as the Firsts gradually migrated from a Saturday competition to a Sunday competition, the Seconds had remained a Saturday competition, still playing at home on alternate weekends to the Firsts but on different days. Now, for the first time, the Seconds were played as curtain-raisers; and, also for the first time, the Seconds became a Sunday competition. As a result, the Seconds finals became curtain-raisers to the Firsts finals; this had happened previously when both competitions were Saturday competitions. However, one consequence was that the lightning premiership, which had occupied the curtain-raiser time- slot since 1972, was discontinued. =Grounds sharing= In the pre-season, Brunswick asked the Association for permission to sublet its home ground, Gillon Oval, to the Juventus soccer club, which was playing in the Victorian soccer competition. Brunswick was struggling financially due to a declining supporter base and sponsorship, and could barely afford to operate; but, it had arranged a deal with the Brunswick Council for a ten-winter lease of Gillon Oval which was financially viable for the club only if it could sublet the ground to Juventus on alternate weekends. The Association had historically operated under strict ground control rules which required clubs to have access to their grounds throughout the winter: these rules served the practical purpose of ensuring the Seconds had a venue to use on weekends when the Firsts played away; and, served the strategic purpose of tying up the best suburban venues to maintain a competitive advantage over rival codes, most notably soccer and rugby. These ground control rules were most strictly enforced in 1959 when Prahran was expelled from the Association because the Victorian Rugby Union was given access to Toorak Park. Given this history, the notion of allowing ground-sharing with a soccer club would be a significant change in policy for the Association. However, as more Association clubs, particularly in areas like Brunswick with high migrant populations where the popularity of soccer and apathy towards football were at their highest, encountered financial hardships and struggled with ground rent, the Association recognised that it could no longer maintain this hardline approach. As such, on 21 March, the Association voted 16‚Äì4 to grant wider permission for ground sharing amongst its clubs. =Order-off rule= The Association adopted an order-off rule, allowing umpires to order a player to leave the field as punishment for high severity indiscretions. In practice, players were ordered off for some but not all reportable offences. Under the rules, a player would be ordered from the field for fifteen minutes of game time and could not be replaced, such that the team played one man short over this time ‚Äì and indeed, in a Seconds match late in the season, Prahran's score was annulled after a headcount revealed that they had erroneously replaced the ordered off player. Division 1 The Division 1 home-and-away season was played over 18 rounds; the top four then contested the finals under the Page‚ÄìMcIntyre system. The finals were played at the Junction Oval. =Ladder= =Finals= =Awards= *The leading goalkicker for the season was Fred Cook (Port Melbourne), who kicked 101 goals during the home-and-away season and 112 goals overall. *The J.

Allender finished ahead of Phil Neilson (Camberwell), who was second with 27 votes, and Derek King (Caulfield), who polled 23 votes. *Port Melbourne won the seconds premiership. Port Melbourne 16.19 (115) defeated Coburg 10.13 (73) in the Grand Final, played as a curtain-raiser to the seniors Grand Final between the same teams on 21 September.

The leading goalkicker across the whole season including finals was Paul Angelis (Waverley), who finished with 100 goals; he was equal-third with Kevin Leece (Werribee) in the home-and-away season with 90 goals, behind McKenna and Peter Neville (Mordialloc, 95 goals). *The J.

Williamstown 21.22 (148) defeated Brunswick 19.13 (127) in the Grand Final, played as a curtain-raiser to the senior Grand Final on 7 September. Notable events =Discussions with the Victorian Football League= During the 1980 season, the Association executive engaged in a series of discussions with Victorian Football League executives over a number of football control issues in Victoria. It was the first time the League and the Association had engaged in any productive collaborative discussion since their relationship soured in the aftermath of North Melbourne's move to Coburg in 1965. Of primary importance to the League was Sunday football. The Association had begun playing matches on Sundays in 1960, and by 1980, Victorian state government rules allowed for almost all sports except for horse racing and League football to be played on Sunday. The League was keen to break into the Sunday market, and proposed to play a game at both the Melbourne Cricket Ground and VFL Park each Sunday ‚Äì but the Association gained a lot of value from its status as the highest level Sunday football competition. Both political parties in state government were sympathetic to the Association's cause, so an agreement between the League and Association was the only thing likely to sway the government's opinion. The League brought a number of concessions to the table in its efforts to negotiate with the Association, including: *No telecasts of Sunday League games *Reconsidering its push to play televised matches on Sundays outside Victoria ‚Äì Sunday League games had been played in Sydney since 1979 and moving games to Brisbane was also under consideration *The League to financially compensate the Association for lost gates *Offering the Association access to VFL Park for matches, including finals *Supporting the Association's attempts to join the Australian Football Championships night series. The Association, which had been suffering a decline in finances and popularity since the mid 1970s, was keen to discuss a number of football control issues and options which it thought could help its viability. Among the agenda items were: *Re-establishing a reciprocal transfer agreement between the League and Association *Seeking support for the Association to rejoin the National Football League, ten years after its expulsion for breaking the transfer agreement it previously had in place *A potential amalgamation between the League Reserves competition and the Association Division 1. Under the proposal, Division 1 would expand to twelve teams, and each would be affiliated with a League club; League players who were not selected in their senior teams would then become available to play with their Association club, instead of the Reserves. Association gates had suffered dramatically in the late 1970s, and one contributing factor was that the number of former League players who had transferred to Association clubs had dropped, so it was thought that an affiliation arrangement could help by bringing more high profile players back to the Association. *The establishment of a new Victorian Metropolitan Football League, to replace the Victorian Football Union as the administrative body for all levels of football in Melbourne ‚Äì in much the same way that the Victorian Country Football League administered country football. Early proposals included promotion and relegation from the city's suburban leagues into and out of the Association second division, revised zoning rules affecting the League clubs, and more unified control. Ultimately, none of these ideas was adopted in the immediate term. The Association discussed the League's proposal for Sunday football at a Board of Management meeting, but voted against it by an overwhelming 22‚Äì3 margin, agreeing that Sunday football was one of the Association's only valuable assets and it could not be given up. Negotiation on all other initiatives broke down shortly thereafter. However, despite its lack of tangible outcomes, the discussions were valuable as signalling an improvement in the relationship between the competitions, and they were notable as the first time that an amalgamation between the League reserves and the Association seniors had been seriously discussed ‚Äì a structural change which ultimately took place twenty years later, prior to the 2000 season. =Interleague matches= In 1980, the Association played two of its highest- profile interstate matches for more than a decade, with matches against the Northern Tasmanian Football Association and the South Australian National Football League. The team was captained by Fred Cook (Port Melbourne) and coached by Mick Erwin (Prahran). The Association's 30-point loss against the S.A.N.F.L. impressed many observers, as the latter had been expected to win comfortably. =Scoreboard rigging controversy= In the final round of the Division 1 home-and-away season, Camberwell Football Club officials caused controversy by intentionally displaying incorrect scores on their scoreboard. Camberwell hosted Dandenong at the Camberwell Sports Ground in the final round, and both teams needed to win and see other results fall favourably to achieve their goals: for Dandenong, it needed to win and see Prahran lose to Preston to finish fourth; for Camberwell, it needed to win and see Frankston lose to Caulfield to avoid relegation. The Camberwell‚ÄìDandenong match was close, and Dandenong led by three points at three-quarter time, but the around-the-grounds scores showed Prahran comfortably ahead of Preston, ostensibly ending Dandenong's chances of reaching the finals. Camberwell 17.14 (116) went on to defeat Dandenong 16.15 (111) by five points. It was only after the game that Dandenong officials discovered that the displayed score of the Preston‚ÄìPrahran match had been false: Preston had actually led by seven goals at three-quarter time, and ended by winning by 68 points, Preston 32.15 (207) d. Prahran 21.13 (139). Dandenong officials were incensed, with coach Ray Biffin and secretary Lionel Farrow claiming that the false scores had taken away Dandenong's incentive to try its best in the final quarter against Camberwell and, given the close result of the game, probably cost it a finals berth. In response, Camberwell secretary Ron Elleray confirmed the scoreboard rigging was intentional, and was entirely unrepentant, saying \\"it was gamesmanship, and if they were silly enough to fall for it, that's their bad luck.\\" Prahran's and Dandenong's losses opened the door for Sandringham to secure fourth, which it did with a 20-point win against Geelong West. Despite its win, Camberwell was unable to avoid relegation, as Frankston defeated Caulfield. Frankston officials were also suspected of potential scoreboard rigging, as Frankston Park announcers had announced at three-quarter time that Camberwell led Dandenong by 20 points, when in fact Camberwell trailed by three points; Caulfield officials noted that the announcement may have spurred Frankston, then leading by 17 points, on to its 34-point victory, but Caulfield made no official complaint and Frankston, unlike Camberwell, denied the misinformation was intentional. The Association executive committee was unimpressed with Camberwell's actions. In October, Camberwell was fined $20 for its misconduct, although the Association put on the record that it would have fined the club $500 if its constitution had allowed it to do so. =Other notable events= *On 13 April, Prahran trailed Sandringham by 42 points at half time, but recovered to win the match by six points, Prahran 22.12 (144) d.

Mahdi is the twelfth Imam for Shia and salat in the Islamic practice of worship of God which Muslims perform five times a day. The prophecy is narrated in numerous hadith collections. A total of 29 Hadiths relate the return of Jesus, and his prayer with Mahdi's lead. Hadith Allamah Sayyid Sa'eed Akhtar Rizvi quotes the above tradition in his book \\"Muhammad (S) is the Last Prophet\\" and concludes: Abu Ya‚Äôala provides another version of this hadith in his musnad with more clear terms. Interpretation There is a belief among Shia Muslims that Jesus and the Mahdi will be both present at the same time, that the leaders who will carry out their commands will be from the Quraysh tribe, and that afterward Jesus will be the Vizier of the Mahdi. It's also believed that he will perform the prayer behind Mahdi and follow him.

Considering one of South America's top Greco-Roman wrestlers in his decade, Barreno has claimed a prestigious gold medal at the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games in Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico, produced a staggering tally of four medals (one silver and three bronze) at the Pan American Games, and also represented as part of the Venezuelan team in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004). Throughout his sporting career, Barreno currently trains for Pena Gillit Wrestling Club in his native town Punto Fijo, under his personal coach Milcho Radulovski. Barreno made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's super heavyweight division (130 kg). He lost his opening match to Ukraine's Georgiy Saldadze by a tough 0‚Äì9 blowout, but redeemed himself to dismantle Australia's Laszlo Kovacs into the ring with a four-point advantage on his second bout. Finishing second in the prelim pool and twelfth overall in the final rankings, Barreno's performance fell short to put him further into the quarterfinals. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Barreno qualified for his second Venezuelan squad, as a 26-year-old, in the men's 120 kg class by placing fifth and receiving a berth from the first Olympic Qualification Tournament in Novi Sad, Serbia and Montenegro. Unlike his previous Games, Barreno suffered through a less tactical game plan as he lost two straight matches each to Armenia's fellow two-time Olympian Haykaz Galstyan with an arduous 3‚Äì9 decision, and France's Yannick Szczepaniak, who threw him off the mat by a technical superiority, in the prelim pool. Barreno failed again to advance further into the quarterfinals after finishing the pool in last place and sixteenth overall. Barreno sought to compete in two more editions of the Olympic Games (2008 and 2012), but missed a chance to earn a spot on the Venezuelan team through the Olympic Qualification Tournament. In 2010, Barreno emerged himself into the global and continental scene, as he took home his first gold in the super heavyweight division at the Central American and Caribbean Games in Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico, thrashing Panama's Irving Herrera in the process. Because of his brilliant success, Barreno was officially named the Athlete of the Year by the Venezuelan Federation of Amateur Wrestling. The following year, Barreno continued to flourish his sporting career, as he picked up a silver medal on his final match against Cuban wrestler and defending Olympic champion Mija√≠n L√≥pez at the 2011 Pan American Games in Guadalajara, Mexico, producing a stark record of four medals, including three bronze, to his career hardware.

They are all deaf and blind because of their extremely premature birth and first few months of life. Birth and infancy The identical triplets are the world's only known deafblind triplets. They were born on April 30, 2000, at 24 weeks. Their mother had gone into labor at 23 weeks, and had managed to hold off delivery until signs of distress in the triplets led to an emergency Caesarean. The three sisters spent months in hospitals, but all three survived to go home. As a result of their premature birth, all three developed advanced-stage retinopathy of prematurity. They began to lose their hearing after their first birthday and by their second birthday were completely deaf. They had developed ototoxicity from the antibiotics they were given in hospital to prevent infection. Treatment and education The triplets live in the Houston area with their mother, Liz, stepfather, George Hooker, and older sister Sarah. All three are completely deaf, but received cochlear implants shortly before their third birthday and have subsequently all been given a second cochlear implant. Sophie is legally blind, but she can still see shapes and read very large print at close range. She also has tunnel vision and wears thick glasses. Zoe can see only light and dark, just enough to find windows and lights, while Emma has no light perception. All three have normal IQs. Sophie can speak; the others communicate mainly through tactile sign language. With the aid of donations to a fund they set up for deafblind children, plus a grant from the Dr. Phil Foundation, Liz and George Hooker pay for specially trained intervenors to provide home-based education, initially for Zoe alone. Films and TV The triplets have been featured on Dr. Phil twice and have been the focus of two documentaries: Through Your Eyes (2006) and Deaf and Blind Triplets (2008).

The story first appeared in 1830 under the title La femme vertueuse (The Virtuous Woman). It was subsequently published in 1832 by Mame et Delaunay as part of Balzac's Sc√®nes de la vie priv√©e (Scenes from Private Life). In 1835 it appeared, in an edition by Madame B√©chet, in the collection √âtudes de m≈ìurs (Studies of Manners). The novel only acquired its present title in 1842, when the fifth edition appeared in Volume I of the Scenes from Private Life, which was also the first volume of Balzac's La Com√©die humaine. The novel comprises two parts, two stories, which are really two sides of the same story. The plot revolves around an act of adultery - a double life, a second family - which is in some sense justified. From the beginning, the setting recalls the atmosphere of Balzac's Ferragus. In a squalid house, in a sordid neighbourhood, an old woman offers an angelic creature - her own daughter - to passers by. The Comte de Granville, unhappily married to a sanctimonious woman, falls in love with this grisette. An aristocrat and a magistrate of integrity, he had made a name for himself in the Gondreville affair, which Balzac would later recount in Une t√©n√©breuse affaire (A Murky Affair). In this work, the author protests against the excesses of bigotry and, according to a principle dear to him, he contrasts the interior design of an aristocratic house with both the grime of a squalid Parisian neighbourhood and the cheerful d√©cor of a grisette's apartment (another familiar theme in the works of Balzac). Madame du Granville's home is, in his eyes: a place of cold, arid solemnity, of moral rectitude and narrow-mindedness. Whereas the grisette's flat, like that of La Torpille (Esther Van Gobseck), is a place of delights.  Plot  Caroline Crochard, a delightful young girl living with her mother in squalid conditions, spends her time sewing in the window. The Comte de Glanville, an aristocrat who was married at too young an age to a bigoted woman, and who is now unhappy in his home, sees the girl and falls in love with her. Balzac takes up their story some years later. Caroline is now richly installed in a luxurious apartment with two children, whose father, known to Caroline as Roger de Granville, cannot acknowledge them on account of his marriage. Eventually Caroline abandons de Granville and takes up with an impoverished young man, who squanders her property.  Commentary  The author of La Com√©die humaine once again employs the technique of the retrospective illumination when in Une t√©n√©breuse affaire, which Balzac began to write in 1839, we are given a glimpse of the professional and political side of de Granville's life - the upright magistrate, who reappears in Splendeurs et mis√®res des courtisanes (Scenes from a Courtesan's Life) of 1838.  Criticism  This story can be considered a minor work of Balzac, who is not particularly known for his achievements in the genre of melodrama. His talent as a portraitist, however, shines through in the character of Caroline, a talent he displayed and refined throughout the writing of La Com√©die humaine.

Church records date back to 1674, and the parish was in the Hundred of Kilgerran (formed in 1536) even though it was in the Cemais administrative area. The region was occupied by the Normans in the 12th century, who built castles at several strategic locations in the area; the clear remains of a motte and bailey exists at Castell Penyrallt (or Castell Pen-yr-allt). A clergyman in 1864 remembered stonework on the latter, but this was no longer evident at the time of the 1925 Royal Commission. The Norman structure may have reused a prehistoric fort. The name of the parish church was Langetot in the Taxatio of 1293, as Langettod in the St David's episcopal register of 1513, and appears on a 1578 parish map of Pembrokeshire as Llantwood.. The attachment to St Illtyd may therefore be of later origin. In 1870, Llantwyd was listed in Wilson's Gazetteer as consisting of , 61 houses and a population of 264. Significant buildings =Parish church= The present parish church of St Illtud dates from 1884, replacing an earlier church of 1820. Stones in the porch suggest there was a church as far back as the 13th century. Pentre Solar, Glanrhyd =Tredefaid= A Grade II listed farmhouse, dating back to the 17th century or earlier. It was originally the home of the Lewes family, and later the Bowen family. =Penralltddu= A Victorian farmhouse built for J. W. Bowen in 1861 on the site of an earlier house dating back at least to 1773. =Pentre Solar= A development of six sustainable homes at Glanrhyd was approved by the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park's planning committee in June 2014, with conditions that the buildings would be manufactured locally and free solar powered electricity would be provided. The development was completed in 2017.

It was screened in the Special Presentations section of the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. Plot Mathias, a down-and-out New Yorker, travels to Paris to sell a large, valuable apartment he has inherited from his estranged father. Once there, he discovers an old woman, Mathilde, living in the apartment with her daughter Chlo√©. Mathias quickly learns that the apartment is a \\"viager\\" ‚Äî an ancient French system for buying and selling apartments ‚Äî and that he will not actually be in possession of the apartment until Mathilde dies, and that until then he owes her a life annuity of ‚Ç¨2,400 a month. All this is a surprise to him, since his father never told him and Mathias had language problems with the French lawyer. Mathias has no money and no place to live, but Mathilde allows him to stay in the apartment with her if he pays rent. However, to pay for the next life annuity payment, he steals and sells furniture from the apartment and also asks a prospective buyer of his contract for advance payments. Mathias discovers that Mathilde and his father had a long-lasting affair while both were married. Mathias and Chlo√© fall in love with each other after emotionally bonding over their childhoods. Since Chlo√© wants to stay in the apartment, Mathias decides at the last minute to decline a multi-million Euro offer for the apartment/contract. Mathilde points out that Mathias does not have to worry about money: he can sell en viager, allowing him to live in the apartment while also providing him a life annuity, albeit a modest one because of his relatively young age of 57.

The technique was designed to put into practice the concept of 'tilted sampling' of the hyperspectral data cube, which had been deemed difficult to achieve.Bershady, Matthew. 3D Spectroscopic Instrumentation.

Retrieved June 10, 2014. Spatio-spectral scanning yields a series of thin, diagonal slices of the data cube. Figuratively speaking, each acquired image is a 'rainbow-colored' spatial map of the scene. More precisely, each image represents two spatial dimensions, one of which is wavelength-coded. To acquire the spectrum of a given object point, scanning is needed. Spatio-spectral scanning combines some advantages of spatial and spectral scanning: Depending on the context of application, one can choose between a mobile and a stationary platform. Moreover, each image is a spatial map of the scene, facilitating pointing, focusing, and data analysis. This is particularly valuable for irregular or irretrievable scanning movements. Being based on dispersion, spatio-spectral scanning systems yield high spatial and spectral resolution.  Prototypical system  A prototypical spatio-spectral scanning system, introduced in June 2014, consists of a basic slit spectroscope (slit + dispersive element) at some suitable, non-zero distance before a camera. (If the effective camera distance is zero, the system is applicable to spatial scanning). The imaging process is based on spectrally-decoded camera obscura projections: A series of projections from a continuous array of pinholes (= the slit) is projected onto the dispersive element, each projection contributing a rainbow-colored strip to the recorded two-dimensional image. The field of view in the wavelength- coded spatial dimension asymptotically approaches the dispersion angle of the dispersive element as the camera distance from the dispersive element approaches infinity. Scanning is achieved by moving the camera transverse to the slit (stationary platform), or by moving the entire system transverse to the slit (mobile platform). Schematic of the prototypical setup. Spatiospectral scanning is achieved by moving the camera or the whole system along the direction of dispersion.  Advanced system  An advanced spatio- spectral scanning system, proposed in June 2014, consists of a dispersive element before a spatial scanning system. (This allows for easy switching between spatial and spatio-spectral scanning). The imaging process is based on spectral analysis of a strip of a dispersed image of the scene. The field of view in the wavelength-coded spatial dimension equals the dispersion angle of the dispersive element. As in the more basic system, scanning is achieved by transverse movement of the slit or by moving the system relative to the scene. Schematic of the advanced setup. The first lens images the object onto the slit plane. The first dispersive element disperses this image. The camera produces an image of the slit plane, the second dispersive element disperses the slit image, thereby creating a rainbow-colored image of the object.

After retiring from the stage in the 1910s, he became a prolific art collector and dealer and also painted his own original works. Decades after his death, art conservators discovered that Bloom was the perpetrator of an art forgery involving an oil portrait that he claimed depicted First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln. Early life Bloom was born Ludwig Pflum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Ludwig and Louisa (n√©e Moyer) Pflum. His parents, who immigrated from Germany, had six other children: Susannah, Susan Deborah, Louisa, Charles, Edward and Adolph (who died as a child). Bloom's father worked as a cooper. The family eventually moved to Reading, Pennsylvania where Bloom attended Poplar Street School. Around 1871, the family moved to Williamsburg where Bloom began working as a jockey. In 1873, he joined the Potter Hart Colossus Circus where he performed a \\"bounding jockey act\\" in which he rode horses and performed acrobatics. During his time at the circus, \\"Ludwig Pflum\\" changed his name to \\"Lew Bloom\\" and would use that name for the remainder of his performing career. Career =Early years= Bloom spent several years touring in variety shows with his jockey act before relocating to Dover, Delaware where he competed in horse match races. He then returned to Reading where he and a friend opened the Drovers' Hotel. The establishment was the first to introduce cabaret to Reading. Bloom performed song and dance acts at the hotel and also began competing as a lightweight boxer. Bloom later became the stage manager for his friend's second establishment, The General Taylor Hotel. He left after two years to work as a clown in the Shelby, Pullman & Hamilton Circus. After a year, Bloom returned to Reading where formed a partnership with vaudevillian Howard Monroe. The duo performed song and dance numbers and comedy skits in blackface until Bloom left the duo and went to New York to perform comedy as a solo act. =Stage and vaudeville= In 1885, Bloom was cast in the play Nobody's Claim, followed by a role in The Red Spider in 1888. It was his role in the latter production where he first conceived of the tramp persona. Bloom's \\"Society Tramp\\" character was a philosophical, shabbily dressed homeless man who drank frequently and was generally treated poorly by other characters. Despite his lowly status, the tramp would make light of his predicament and maintained a positive and comicial outlook. Typically, tramp characters like Bloom's included slapstick comedy routines as well as dancing or pantomime. One of Bloom's tramp character's jokes was, \\"I don't spend all my time in saloons. I can't. They have to close up some time.\\" Bloom's tramp character became a big hit with audiences and was quickly copied by hundreds of other performers of the era including Nat M. Wills and Charles R. Sweet. Charlie Chaplin and W. C. Fields also established long and successful stage and film careers portraying their version of the tramp persona. Bloom would later insist he originated the character and that he was \\"the first stage tramp in the business\\". Bloom's stage career peaked in the 1890s. Throughout the decade, he continued to portray tramps in various stage productions by Charles Hale Hoyt including A Black Sheep, On the Bowery, A Milk White Flag, A Day and a Night and A Society Tramp. After leaving Hoyt in 1892, Bloom and his wife (whom he married in 1892), known as \\"Miss Jane Cooper\\", toured the vaudeville circuit with their comedy act \\"A Picture of Life\\". Bloom played his usual tramp role while his wife played the comic foil - a \\"New England spinster\\" or a \\"city maiden.\\" By 1909, Bloom's tramp persona had run its course and his career began to wane. At least one critic during that time said that Bloom had become \\"the worst act on the bill\\" of vaudeville shows. Later years After retiring from performing in the late 1910s, Bloom lived in Mount Penn, Pennsylvania where he spent his time painting in his studio and collecting and dealing art. He began purchasing artwork during his stage career. Between 1889 and 1892, he purchased thirty to forty paintings from artist Ralph Albert Blakelock. Upon his sister Susan's death in 1910, he inherited her art collection. In April 1907, Bloom exhibited seven pieces of his original works at the Reinhard Rieger Gallery in Mount Penn. The exhibition also included a copy of The Brooklet In the Meadow, by Herman Rheudesela that Bloom painted (the original painting was also exhibited). Bloom later moved to New York and occasionally returned to his hometown of Reading to spend time with his family and attend Elks Club meetings. He also trained horses for Metropolitan Race Clubs in the New York and Pennsylvania area and in Cuba. Death On December 10, 1929, Bloom was admitted to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan, New York City. He died there two days later of \\"complication of diseases\\" at the age of 70. Bloom's funeral was held at the Seidel Funeral Chapel in Reading on December 16. He was buried at Charles Evans Cemetery the following morning. Mary Todd Lincoln hoax In early 1929, Bloom made news when he announced that he had acquired a previously unknown oil portrait of former First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln, the widow of slain president Abraham Lincoln. Bloom claimed shortly before President Lincoln was assassinated on April 14, 1865, Mary Lincoln commissioned painter Francis Bicknell Carpenter (who had lived at the White House for six months during Lincoln's presidency and had previously painted First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln) to paint a portrait of her as gift to her husband. After the President's death, Bloom claimed that Mary Lincoln was unable to pay Carpenter for the painting and asked him to destroy it. According to Bloom, Carpenter kept the painting and eventually sold it to a wealthy Philadelphia shipbuilder named Jacob G. Neafie who was a great fan of President Lincoln's. After Neafie died, Bloom said that Neafie's daughter inherited the portrait who then gave it to Bloom's sister Susan as gift for taking care of her mother, Anna \\"Annie\\" Neafie, who died in 1860. Upon Susan's death in 1910, Bloom inherited her art collection which he said included the portrait of Mary Lincoln. To validate his claim of the portrait's authenticity, Bloom attached a notarized affidavit to it and displayed the portrait at Milch Galleries in Manhattan. Shortly before his death in December 1929, he sold the portrait to President and Mary Lincoln's granddaughter Jessie Harlan Lincoln, the daughter of the Lincolns' eldest and only surviving son Robert Todd Lincoln. The exact sale price is unknown, but is believed to be between $2,000 to $3,000 (approximately $ to $ today). The portrait was the subject of considerable media attention and was written about in the February 12, 1929 edition of the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune. It was later mentioned in various books about the Lincolns, including Carl Sandburg's 1932 biography Mary Lincoln: Wife and Widow. In 1976, Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith, the last undisputed Lincoln descendant, donated the portrait to the Illinois State Historical Library (now known as the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum). At the time, the portrait was estimated to be worth $400,000 (approximately $ today). In 1978, art conservators at the Art Institute of Chicago noted that the portrait had been \\"heavily retouched\\" and contained significant elements that were added after the original painting had been completed. After a partial restoration, it was discovered that the facial area of the subject had been altered. The woman in the portrait was noted to have coloring that was brighter than the original 1929 portrait and that the face of the woman was \\"different, plainer\\" than Mary Todd Lincoln's. The conservators also discovered that the subject was wearing a cross necklace which Mary Lincoln would not have worn as she was not a Roman Catholic. As the painting had been owned by the Lincoln family, the authenticity of the painting was not immediately questioned. The conservators that worked on the initial restoration reasoned that the added paint was likely the result of \\"heavy handed\\" retouches by other conservators or by Francis Bicknell Carpenter who was known to \\"fiddle with\\" his finished paintings. The lack of resemblance to the woman in the portrait to the real Mary Lincoln was rationalized as \\"artistic idealization\\". For the next 32 years, the portrait hung at the Illinois Executive Mansion in Springfield, Illinois. In April 2010, art conservator Barry Bauman was hired to clean the portrait as it had accumulated dirt and grime after years of being displayed. Bauman also hoped to restore the portrait to its previous 1929 appearance. During the restoration, Bauman soon discovered that a layer of varnish sat on top of the paint indicating that someone had altered the original. After removing the varnish, Bauman discovered that the woman Bloom claimed was Mary Todd Lincoln was an unknown woman who bore no resemblance to the former First Lady. It was noted that the woman's coloring was \\"...much fresher, a much warmer, a much redder toned, flesh toned...\\" than the original painting depicted. Bauman also discovered that a brooch bearing the face of Abraham Lincoln worn by the subject covered a floral brooch. Bauman also inspected the signature of Francis Bicknell Carpenter and the date, both of which were added on top of the varnish layer. After comparing the signature to Carpenter's other paintings, the signature was deemed a forgery. After the portrait was completely restored, Bauman determined that while it had been painted in the 1860s (likely around 1864), the woman in the portrait was not Mary Todd Lincoln and the painting was not the work of Francis Bicknell Carpenter. The real subject of the portrait and the artist remain unknown. Bauman also determined that Bloom, who also painted his own works, had likely altered the original portrait himself. Bauman also believed Bloom painted over the original portrait, forged Carpenter's name and created the fake affidavit. Bloom's claim that the portrait was given to his sister Susan by Jacob G. Neafie's daughter in appreciation of her care for the ailing Anna Neafie was proven to be false. Susan Bloom was born in 1855 and was only five years old when Anna Neafie died in 1860. James M. Cornelius, the curator of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, believes that Bloom was able to pull off the hoax because all the participants in his story were dead. Cornelius also believes that Bloom sought the Lincolns out to not only make money from the sale of the portrait but to legitimatize its authenticity. Bloom was likely aware that the surviving Lincolns were eager to portray Mary and her son Robert Todd Lincoln in a more sympathetic light after the family had received a great deal of negative publicity after Robert had his mother forcibly institutionalized in 1875.

As of 2014, it has expanded its physical facilities and now possesses dedicated buildings for the early years, elementary and secondary sections. It also includes a sports complex, creative arts building and two additional multi-purpose buildings. A fourth multi-purpose building, the Hub, was completed in June 2014, while renovation of the older facilities began.http://www.nist.ac.th/campus-development-plan/ Arts facilities include a 300-seat theatre, multiple visual arts studios, multiple dance studios, multiple instrumental and vocal music rooms, private practice rooms and a recording studio. The sports complex includes a FIFA- certified football pitch, gymnastics studio, sports hall with multiple basketball and volleyball courts, swimming pool, two tennis courts, and multiple classrooms.

All classes, with the exception of second language courses, are taught in English. In line with the IB philosophy and learner profile, the school adopts an academic approach that emphasizes collaboration, hands-on learning and exploration. Students learn both on and off campus through service activities, internships and the school's annual off-campus trips. As a compulsory part of the curriculum, all NIST students must also learn a language other than English. In 2014 NIST partnered with Yokohama International School and Zurich International School in offering the Global Citizen Diploma (GCD), an optional, additive certificate that reflects graduates' leadership, service and community engagement. The GCD aims to identify \\"the diversity of gifts students may have, rather than assuming the importance of any particular set of skills or knowledge, based on any cultural bias.\\"http://blogs.yis.ac.jp/yisgcd/ Notably, NIST's class of 2017 scored an average of 36.3 points on the IB diploma examinations compared to the world average of approximately 30, with 16.2% of the students earning 40 or higher and 41.4% earning 38 or higher, compared to the respective global averages of 4.1% and 16.7%. Extra-curricular activities NIST was one of the founding members of the Southeast Asian Schools Athletic Conference (SEASAC), an association of twelve major international schools in Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Myanmar and Indonesia. SEASAC events include sports, arts and academic competitions. NIST's athletic teams also compete in the Bangkok International Schools Athletic Conference (BISAC). NIST has varsity teams for tennis, badminton, swimming, softball and rugby. All NIST teams are the Falcons, named for the school mascot, and wear blue uniforms highlighted with silver, grey and/or white.

Early life and career Swain was born on 31 August 1903 and was the fourth and youngest child of Charles Swain and Rose Downs. He grew up in Portsmouth and joined the RAF in 1922, becoming a member of No. 2 Squadron RAF as a pilot. He was quickly transferred to No. 11 Squadron, subsequently spending time with No. 23 Squadron and No. 6 Squadron as a Flight Commander, commanding the Cairo-Rhodesia Flight in 1933. World altitude record In 1935, now with the rank of squadron leader, Swain became a test pilot in the experimental section at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) where he was involved in high-altitude experiments. Departing from Farnborough, Hampshire at 07:30 on 28 September 1936, Swain achieved the world altitude record with a height of 49,967 ft in a modified Bristol Type 138A. During his descent, his pressure suit failed causing him to lose visibility through his visor and find it difficult to breathe. He was forced to cut his visor open with his knife in order to maintain consciousness, eventually landing safely at Netheravon, Wiltshire at 10:30. Later career In 1937, Swain left the RAE to command No. 1 Squadron. He then attended the RAF Staff College in 1938, and spent the Second World War and his remaining career in various staff positions. His last appointment was SASO/Deputy Head of the Air Staff, British Joint Services Mission, Washington, D.C., retiring from the RAF in 1954 with the rank of Air Commodore. Personal life Swain married American Sarah Mitchell Le Fevre in Portsmouth on 5 November 1938, going on to have three children together. He died in Gainesville, Florida on 28 September 1989.

The ceremony was performed by the Dayak Nyobeng Bidayu, Sebujit Hamlet, Village Hlibuei, Subdistrict Siding, Bengkayang and West Kalimantan, Indonesia. It was abandoned in 1894. Ceremony In the ceremony, humans were decapitated and their skulls preserved. It took place over a three-day period in June, led by elder Nyobeng Sebujit. As the guests arrived, the participants aimed their guns at the sky and fired a salute, intended as a sign of respect for their ancestors before starting the nyobeng. Guests were welcomed to show the bond between the village and people outside the village. Later, a local community leader would throw a puppu into the air as visitors attempted to slash it with swords as it fell, repeating the process if the animal reached the ground alive. The elder then repeated the process with a chicken. Later, residents would toss chicken eggs in the direction of the guests. Breaking eggs in such a way was seen as a demonstration of sincerity. If the egg did not break, it meant that the guests who came to the village were not sincere or genuine. The elders stored the skulls in a box with a boar necklace. The Dayak Bidayuh consider the head to be a symbol of human identity,They considered the skull to be the world's most powerful magic, capable of increasing crop yields and warding off evil spirits. While headhunting has long been abandoned by Dayak Bidayuh people, a modified nyobeng ritual continues to be preserved as a traditional way to manifest peace and gratitude for good harvests.

Until 12 May they reportedly killed 37 residents and cut off water and medical care, held house-to-house raids to arrest hundreds of residents and shelled the town. On 13, 20, 21, 27 and 29 May, again 21 protesters reportedly were killed by security forces. At least 13 soldiers or policemen were killed in May by terrorist groups, the government reported.  Background  15 and 16 March 2011, demonstrations for democracy took place in six cities across Syria, the largest protest was in Daraa. This started a series of ever larger and angrier demonstrations all around Syria through March and April, with security forces firing on demonstrators resulting in hundreds of deaths. The protests spread, among other places, to Homs on Friday 18 March, after online calls for a \\"Friday of Dignity\\" (). 2,000 protesters then took to the streets in Homs after Friday prayers. As protests in Syria continued, Homs became one of the most restive cities in Syria, with more protests on 25 and 29 March and 95 civilian deaths during protests on 1, 8, 17-19, 22 and 29 April 2011. On 25 April, the Syrian government had intensified its crackdown on the protests with an organised military attack on the city of Daraa, on 26 April on Douma.

After the prayer, the men and women separate. The groups face each other on the main street. With the signal of a Hindu leader, both sides approach the center of the road. Male participants pull and kiss the female participants while other villagers pour buckets of water over them. This ceremony has become a meeting place for singles. Many couples have met through this tradition.

It is the Gateway of Sabarimala. For Sabarimala Devotees from Tamilnadu, Andhra, Telangana and Karnataka, SCT - PUU is the easy way. The temples related to Sabarimala like Achankovil, Aryankavu, and Kulathuppuzha are Located near Punalur. The Kollam‚ÄìShencottah railway line is the first railway line in erstwhile Travancore state and is more than a century old. The Kollam‚ÄìSengottai section is part of the Kollam‚ÄìChennai metre gauge rail route commissioned by the British during 1904. The line which was metre gauge has been completely converted into Broad Gauge and Train Services started.  History  The first idea of rail link from Tirunelveli to Kollam which was the trading capital of the Travancore Kingdom was conceived in 1873. The line was sanctioned by the Madras Presidency in 1899 and the survey was completed in 1900.The railway line was built jointly by South Indian railway, Travancore state and Madras Presidency.It was the ruler's desire to create a rail link between Kollam, the then commercial capital of his State and Madras. The meter gauge line from Kollam to Punalur was inaugurated by on 1 June 1904. The Punalur‚ÄìSengottai railway line was inaugurated on 26 November 1904.The construction of the meter gauge rail route between Kollam‚ÄìPunalur and Punalur‚ÄìShenkottai (Ghats Section) along the scenic mountain terrain was started in 1873 by the British engineers and was completed in 1902. Travancore rulers in association with the British prepared the plan for the track through the challenging mountain terrain as it involved construction of long arch bridges over steep valleys and tunnels across the rocky mountains of Western Ghats. The first goods train travelled on this route in 1902 and a train carrying its first passengers began its run in 1904. It makes for a thrilling train journey as it passes over five big bridges and hundreds of tiny ones while negotiating mountain streams and valleys. Passengers are also treated to a breath‚Äìtaking view of the Western Ghats. The train also passes through five tunnels on this stretch, including the one‚Äìkilometer long tunnel between Bhagawathipuram and Arayankavu. The station at Punalur was equipped with locomotive service centre, Parcel and Timber Depot, Train parking bays, Storage Tanks for water and oil, etc. The scenic Punalur‚ÄìShencotta railway lies across the western ghats, providing a valuable link across the southern states. The journey through the western ghats is incredible. Layout The station has three platforms, of which two are functional. It also has five tracks used for passenger and shunting purpose. Gauge Conversion The Punalur-Sengottai section is part of the Kollam-Sengottai-Tenkasi-Tirunelveli- Thiruchendur gauge conversion project and part of the Tenkasi-Virudhunagar trunk route to Chennai at an estimate of . The gauge conversion of the Thiruchendur-Sengottai section has been completed and is open to traffic. In Kollam Junction-Shenkottai section the broad gauge conversion is also finished. Now it is serving as the shortest rail-route from Kochi port to Tuticorin port. Infrastructure of the station will be changed as proposed in tune with handling demands and matching to the glory of past. Kollam - Punalur section The Kollam Junction -Punalur meter gauge railway line to broad gauge conversion works foundation stone was laid in 1998 at Punalur. Services on the Punalur-Kollam metre gauge section were withdrawn on 1 May 2007, to facilitate the gauge conversion work. The gauge conversion took almost 11 years to complete after the foundation stone was laid. The line was converted to broad gauge and inaugurated on 10 May 2010. Express and Passenger train services connecting Punalur to Chennai, Tirunelveli Junction, Palakkad Junction, Kollam Junction, Madurai, Guruvayur and Kanyakumari are currently operational in this route. Punalur - Sengottai section To facilitate the gauge conversion work on the Punalur-Sengottai section, train services on the section were withdrawn in September 2010. The Punalur-Sengottai section gauge conversion works is in progress currently and expected to get completed by 2017. Sections like Punalur-Edamon reach and Sengottai-Bhagavathipuram reach have been completed and open for traffic,  Services  The station presently handles six express trains services to , , , , , and eight passenger train services, of which four services ply to , one of the passenger trains run between Punalur and Sengottai, while one pair each run from Punalur to , and . And thereby, the railhead also connects Thiruvananthapuram, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Nagercoil, Tirunelveli and Trichy Future A new railway line is proposed from Sabarimala to Thiruvananthapuram via Punalur. If this proposed Sabarimala Railway is connected to proposed new railway terminal at near Thiruvananthapuram via Nedumangad, several long distance trains are supposed to be operated from Nemom terminal via Punalur to Chennai/Bangalore and rest of country. DEMU (Diesel Multiple Unit) service would be launched in Kollam- Punalur section soon. Rail Electrification works between Kollam Punalur section started and cexpected to complete March 2021. New Express trains connecting Ernakulam to Velankanni, Ernakulam to Thoothukudi, Manglore to Thoothukudi, Guruvayur to Rameshwaram, Karaikkal to Kochuveli, Nizamuddin to Kochuveli and Bangalore to Kochuveli is also proposed in this route, waiting for RB approval.

Biography  Kulmann was born in the Russian Empire, one of the several children of Boris Fedorovich, and Mary (n√©e Rosenberg) Kulmann. Her father, a collegiate councilor and a retired captain, died early. The family lived on Vasilyevsky Island in St. Petersburg. As a child, Kulman showed phenomenal philological abilities, learning ancient and modern languages under the direction of Karl Grosgeynrikh. She achieved fluency in 11 languages. Kulman wrote over 1,000 poems before her death at age 17. Robert Schumann considered her a wunderkind and set some of her poems to music including \\"Mailied\\" [\\"May Song\\"] and \\"An den Abendstern\\" [\\"To the Evening Star\\"]. Kulman was buried in the Smolensky Cemetery in St. Petersburg, in a tomb bearing a carving by Alexander Triscorni - a marble sculpture of a girl on a bed of roses. The monument bears inscriptions in several languages, including Latin: Prima Russicarum operam dedit idiomati graeco, undecim novit linguas, loquebatur octo, quamquam puella poetria eminens (The first Russian young girl, who knew the Greek language, and learned eleven languages, spoken in eight, and was an excellent poet).Elisabeth Kulmann (1808-1825) In the 1930s, the Soviet authorities moved Kulman's remains to the Tikhvin Cemetery in the Alexander Nevsky monastery.

Payment solutions that offer similar encryption but do not meet the P2PE standard are referred to as end-to-end encryption (E2Ee) solutions. The objective of P2PE and E2Ee is to provide a payment security solution that instantaneously converts confidential payment card (credit and debit card) data and information into indecipherable code at the time the card is swiped to prevent hacking and fraud. It is designed to maximize the security of payment card transactions in an increasingly complex regulatory environment.  The standard  The P2PE Standard defines the requirements that a \\"solution\\" must meet in order to be accepted as a PCI validated P2PE solution. A \\"solution\\" is a complete set of hardware, software, gateway, decryption, device handling, etc. Only \\"solutions\\" can be validated; individual pieces of hardware such as card readers cannot be validated. It is also a common mistake to refer to P2PE validated solutions as \\"certified\\"; there is no such certification. The determination of whether or not a solution meets the P2PE standard is the responsibility of a P2PE Qualified Security Assessor (P2PE-QSA). P2PE-QSA companies are independent third-party companies who employ assessors that have met the PCI Security Standards Council's requirements for education and experience, and have passed the requisite exam. The PCI Security Standards Council does not validate solutions.  How it works  As a payment card is swiped through a card reading device, referred to as a point of interaction (POI) device, at the merchant location or point of sale, the device immediately encrypts the card information. A device that is part of a PCI validated P2PE solution uses an algorithmic calculation to encrypt the confidential payment card data. From the POI, the encrypted, indecipherable codes are sent to the payment gateway or processor for decryption. The keys for encryption and decryption are never available to the merchant, making card data entirely invisible to the retailer. Once the encrypted codes are within the secure data zone of the payment processor, the codes are decrypted to the original card numbers and then passed to the issuing bank for authorization. The bank either approves or rejects the transaction, depending upon the card holder's payment account status. The merchant is then notified if the payment is accepted or rejected to complete the process along with a token that the merchant can store. This token is a unique number reference to the original transaction that the merchant can use should they ever be needed to perform research or refund the customer without ever knowing the customer's card information (tokenization). There are also Qualified Integrator and Reseller (QIR) Companies, which are businesses authorized to \\"implement, configure, and/or support validated\\" PA-DSS Payment Applications, and perform qualified installations.PCI Security Standards: Assessors and Solutions  Solution providers  According to the PCI Security Standards Council: > The P2PE solution provider is a third-party entity (for example, a > processor, acquirer, or payment gateway) that has overall responsibility for > the design and implementation of a specific P2PE solution, and manages P2PE > solutions for its merchant customers. The solution provider has overall > responsibility for ensuring that all P2PE requirements are met, including > any P2PE requirements performed by third-party organizations on behalf of > the solution provider (for example, certification authorities and key- > injection facilities).  Benefits  = Customer benefits = P2PE significantly reduces the risk of payment card fraud by instantaneously encrypting confidential cardholder data at the moment a payment card is swiped or 'dipped' if it is a chip card at the card reading device (payment terminal) or POI. = Merchant benefits = P2PE significantly facilitates merchant responsibilities: * With a P2PE validated solution, merchants save significant time and money as PCI requirements may be greatly reduced. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). For organizations who use a P2PE validated solution provider, the PCI Self Assessment Questionnaire is reduced from 12 sections to 4 sections and the controls are reduced from 329 questions to just 35. * In the event of fraud, the P2PE Solution Provider, not the merchant, is held accountable for data loss and resulting fines that may be assessed by the card brands (American Express, Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and JCB). The PCI Security Standards Council does not assess penalties on Solution Providers or Merchants. * The payment process with P2PE is quicker than other transaction processes; thus, creating simpler and faster customer-merchant transactions.  Point-to-point encryption versus end-to-end encryption  = Point-to- point = A point-to-point connection directly links system 1 (the point of payment card acceptance) to system 2 (the point of payment processing). A true P2PE solution is determined with three main factors: # The solution uses a hardware-to-hardware encryption and decryption process along with a POI device that has SRED (Secure Reading and Exchange of Data) listed as a function. # The solution has been validated to the PCI P2PE Standard which includes specific POI device requirements such as strict controls regarding shipping, receiving, tamper-evident packaging and installation. # A solution includes merchant education in the form of a P2PE Instruction Manual, which guides the merchant on POI device use, storage, return for repairs and regular PCI reporting. = End-to-end = End-to-end encryption as the name suggests has the advantage over P2PE that card details are not unencrypted between the two endpoints. If the endpoints are a PCI PED validated PIN pad and a POS acquirer, there is no opportunity for the card details to be intercepted. It is obviously important that the endpoints (the PED and gateway) are provided by PCI accredited organisations.  PCI point-to-point encryption requirements  The requirements include: # Secure encryption of payment card data at the point of interaction (POI), # P2PE validated application(s) at the point of interaction, # Secure management of encryption and decryption devices, # Management of the decryption environment and all decrypted account data, # Use of secure encryption methodologies and cryptographic key operations, including key generation, distribution, loading/injection, administration and usage.

His work has been exhibited internationally, among others, at the International Center of Photography in New York, the Mus√©e de l'√âlys√©e in Lausanne, Rencontres d'Arles in Arles, the Brooklyn Museum in New York, and the Joods Historisch Museum in Amsterdam. Early life and education Brenner was born in Paris and grew up in France. In 1981, Brenner received a B.A. in French Literature and Social Anthropology from the Paris-Sorbonne University. He went on to study at the √âcole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales and received a M.A. in Social Anthropology, also awarded by the Sorbonne. Brenner is the recipient of the Ni√©pce Prize and his book Diaspora: Homelands in Exile won the 2004 National Jewish Book Award in Visual Arts. Career At age 19, Brenner began photographing Orthodox Jews in the Mea Shearim neighborhood of Jerusalem. Initially, he believed this was \\"authentic Judaism,\\" but his approach quickly evolved into an exploration of the multiplicities of dissonant identities. In 1981, Brenner began photographing Jewish communities around the world, exploring what it means to live and survive with a portable identity and how Jews adopted the traditions and manners of their home countries and yet remained part of the Jewish people. He spent 25 years chronicling the diaspora of the Jews across the world from Rome to New York, India to Yemen, Morocco to Ethiopia, Sarajevo to Samarkand. Brenner has published five books and directed three films. His work has been shown in museums and galleries around the world. He has been represented by Howard Greenberg Gallery in New York since 1990. Brenner‚Äôs opus Diaspora: Homelands in Exile was published as a two- volume set of photographs and texts by HarperCollins in 2003 and appeared in four foreign editions. Diaspora was also a major exhibition, which opened in New York at the Brooklyn Museum in 2003 and traveled to nine other cities in America, Europe and Mexico. In reviewing the book, The New Yorker wrote: \\"Brenner's work‚Äîelegiac, celebratory, irreverent‚Äîtranscends portraiture, representing instead a prolonged, open-ended inquiry into the nature of identity and heritage.\\" NPR's Robert Siegel has described Brenner's work as \\"a celebration of the diversity and complexity of diaspora.\\" In 2006, Brenner founded This Place, a collective photography project aimed at recontextualizing Israel from multiple perspectives. The photographers working on this project include Wendy Ewald, Martin Kollar, Josef Koudelka, Jungjin Lee, Gilles Peress, Fazal Sheikh, Stephen Shore, Rosalind Solomon, Thomas Struth, Jeff Wall, and Nick Waplington.

DeLong-Bas is an American scholar and the author of a number of books on Islam, as well as \\"numerous book chapters and encyclopedia articles\\" on the subject of \\"Saudi Arabia, Wahhabism, Islamic thought and history, Islam and politics, and contemporary jihadism\\". Biography DeLong-Bas is associate professor at the Boston College theology department. She also serves in a number of editorial, advisory and consulting roles. Previously DeLong-Bas has taught at Brandeis University and worked as a consultant for the RAND Corporation. Views DeLong-Bas has expressed the view that there is too much negativity towards Wahhabism in the West, and in her writings has argued that Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab was \\"not the godfather of contemporary terrorist movements\\", but > \\"a voice of reform, reflecting mainstream eighteenth-century Islamic > thought. His vision of Islamic society was based upon monotheism in which > Muslims, Christians, and Jews were to enjoy peaceful co-existence and > cooperative commercial treaty relations.\\" DeLong-Bas believes that extremism in Saudi Arabia \\"does not stem from\\" Islam, but from issues such as oppression of the Palestinian people, \\"Iraq, and the American government's tying [the hands of] the U.N. [and preventing it] from adopting any resolution against Israel, have definitely added to the Muslim youth's state of frustration.\\" In an December 21, 2006 interview in the London daily Asharq Al-Awsat, DeLong-Bas was quoted as stating that she did \\"...not find any evidence that would make me agree that Osama bin Laden was behind the Attack on the Twin Towers\\". A month later in The Justice‚Äîthe student newspaper of Brandeis University (where she was teaching at the time) -- she disputed the quote, stating: \\"Of course he did. He's the CEO of Al-Qaeda and the leader of their political agenda. All I claimed was that he didn't have anything to do with the logistics or the planning of the attacks themselves.\\" Wahhabi Islam: From Revival and Reform to Global Jihad DeLong-Bas's book Wahhabi Islam: From Revival and Reform to Global Jihad was published in 2004 by Oxford University Press. It is based \\"on a close study of the 14 volumes\\" of collected works of Wahhabism's founder, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab and has been called \\"the first extensive explication of the theology\\" of Wahhabism. It is divided into sections: a brief religious biography and history of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, theology, Islamic law, women and Wahhabism, jihad and the evolution of Wahhabism. =Critical reception= Wahhabi Islam: From Revival and Reform to Global Jihad has been praised as a \\"monumental work ... lucid and carefully documented\\", \\"often fascinating\\", and presenting \\"a nuanced discussion of Wahhab's Quranic interpretation\\", but also criticized as a \\"piece of scholarly trash\\" and of \\"markedly inferior quality\\", and guilty of \\"special pleading\\". It has received positive reviews from David E. Long in Middle East Journal (a \\"monumental work ... a lucid and carefully documented assessment of Wahhabism.\\"), Sara Powell in Washington Report on Middle East Affairs (\\"...a well-regarded, logically constructed, and considered --if perhaps somewhat sympathetic--analysis of Abd al-Wahhab's beliefs\\"), History magazine (\\"a ground-breaking study ... both controversial and informative\\"). But others have questioned the book and DeLong-Bas's views on Wahhabism. Author Stephen Suleyman Schwartz has called her an \\"apologist\\", criticizing her for among other things, receiving financial support from Saudi Arabia; not including as a source the correspondence of ibn Abd al-Wahhab, \\"which critics of Wahhabism and other Saudis consider key to understanding him\\"; and failing to mention the religious and/or governmental background of some Saudi Arabians mentioned in her acknowledgments. Journalist and author Michael J. Ybarra, called the book \\"often fascinating\\", and providing \\"a nuanced discussion of Wahhab's Quranic interpretation\\", but also complained that she \\"seems to bend over backward to give Wahhab the benefit of the doubt while dismissing his critics as biased.\\" He also notes that DeLong-Bas \\"doesn't say ... where on earth\\" the tolerant form of Wahhabism described by her \\"ever existed\\", and that \\"the voice of Wahhab himself is largely absent from this book\\" because the author rarely quotes him. Khaled Abou El Fadl, professor of law at University of California, Los Angeles who writes frequently on Islamic jurisprudence, expressed sorrow that Oxford University Press had published the book, stating \\"This doesn't qualify as scholarship -- it falls within the general phenomenon of Saudi apologetics.\\" Michael Sells, professor at the University of Chicago wrote that DeLong-Bas never challenges the propriety of Abd al-Wahhab's claim to authority to distinguish believers from unbelievers and to impose the most severe sanctions on those he disagrees with. Simon Ross Valentine suggested that the image of Wahhabism presented by Delong-Bas is a \\"rewriting of history that flies in the face of historical fact\\".

From 2008 to 2013, he served in a number of product management roles at Google in London and California, including Vice President and product spokesman of Google's Android division. He was vice president of the Chinese electronics company, Xiaomi, from 2014 to 2017. As of January 2017, he is Vice President of Virtual Reality at Facebook, which he joined shortly after his departure from Xiaomi. Early life and education Barra attended primary and secondary schools at local Col√©gio Pit√°goras in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and in 1995 enrolled at the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG), majoring in Electrical Engineering. In 1996, Barra transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), graduating with a bachelor's degree in management science and masters in electrical engineering and computer science. He was class president of the class of 2000 and student keynote speaker at MIT commencement 2000. Career =Google= Barra with Eric Schmidt and Andy Rubin at the launch of the Nexus 7 Barra joined American technology company Google in London in March 2008 as Group Product Manager for the Google Mobile team. In 2010 Barra joined the Android team. From 2010 to 2013, Barra's role expanded to include product spokesperson for the Android team, speaking at both press conferences and Google I/O, Google's annual developer-focused conference. Barra's product involvement included the entire Android ecosystem of software and hardware, including Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean and KitKat operating system launches, the Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 smartphones, the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 tablets, and other related products such as Google Now, selected in 2013 as Popular Science's Innovation of the Year, and Google Voice Search, Google's speech recognition service. He was promoted to Vice President in 2012. =Xiaomi= In September 2013, Barra left Google for Chinese electronics company Xiaomi, serving as Vice President of International. The move was considered a ‚Äòsignificant hire‚Äô for Xiaomi, one of the fastest growing manufacturers in China, enhancing international legitimacy to the company by adding a key former Google Android executive to its senior management. In December 2013, Barra spoke at LeWeb tech conference in Paris, France about his impressions of the Chinese economy and the opportunity it represented for tech companies such as Xiaomi, citing China's 600 million internet users, high market caps of recent Chinese IPOs, the massive scale of the top Chinese apps' monthly active users, and the size of companies such as Alibaba's Taobao, a shopping site more than double the size of eBay and Amazon combined. The talk was widely cited throughout the industry. In February 2014, Barra announced the launch of the new Redmi and Mi3 smartphones in Singapore, then in India. Global expansion outside of China into surrounding emerging markets is a key initiative for Xiaomi, given the company's business model to release high performance smartphone products at an affordable consumer price, generating revenue not only from the hardware itself, but the software and internet services provided to the consumer. According to Xiaomi co-founder and president Lei Jun, it is \\"entirely Barra‚Äôs job to figure out which region that we should enter next and how.\\" Barra has stated intentions to expand next into various countries. In March 2014, Barra visited Foxconn, a Taiwanese manufacturing company with plants in Brazil and Mexico responsible for assembling products for various tech brands, indicating plans for Xiaomi to expand into Latin America. In May 2014, Barra announced the launch of the MiPad, a 7.9 inch tablet. \\"We spent four years working up to the point where we thought we had the right hardware design and software capability to build a world-class tablet,\\" Barra said. \\"We think we are there, finally.\\" Barra described the release as part of Xiaomi's overall strategy to expand both its product lineup and into new international markets including Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore. Barra also indicated eventual plans to enter the U.S. market. In January 2017, Barra announced his departure from Xiaomi. Barra explained his decision had been strongly motivated by a feeling of detachment from his family and the life he had built up in Silicon Valley. \\"What I've realized is that the last few years of living in such a singular environment have taken a huge toll on my life and started affecting my health. My friends, what I consider to be my home, and my life are back in Silicon Valley, which is also much closer to my family. Seeing how much I've left behind these past few years, it is clear to me that the time has come to return.\\" There are reports that quoted Barra saying that his resignation was prompted by health reasons and some analysts noted that the departure came amid Xiaomi's declining sales in China. On the other hand, global expansion has been successful. Around the time of his resignation, Xiaomi announced that it has exceeded US$1 billion in revenue from the Indian market alone. =Facebook= He announced in a Facebook post on 25 January 2017 that he would be joining Facebook as Vice President of virtual reality, writing: > \\"I‚Äôm excited to share my next adventure as I return to Silicon Valley‚Äîin a > couple of months I'll be joining Facebook as VP of virtual reality (VPVR!) > and lead the Oculus team. Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun always says that the highest > calling of an engineer is to make technology breakthroughs quickly and > readily available to the widest possible spectrum of humanity. That will be > my mission at Facebook and I look forward to building the future of > immersive technology with Mark Zuckerberg, Brendan Trexler Iribe, Mike > Schroepfer, and the visionaries in the Oculus > team.\\"https://www.facebook.com/hbarra76/posts/10154020362016612 Based on his early pronouncements, Barra appears to be focusing on the development of standalone VR headsets as well as social VR. During an appearance at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), he described the technology as \\"a product category that will help us bring the most number of people into VR and really start unlocking these opportunities for social presence.\\" During the event, Barra announced Oculus' standalone VR headset called Oculus Go, with Xiaomi as global hardware partner. Honors and awards In 2011, Barra was ranked #23 in Wired Magazine's Wired 100. In 2013, Business Insider's Silicon Valley 100 included Barra at #92. Brazil's √âpoca magazine ranked Barra among the most influential Brazilians in both 2011 and 2013.

The inscriptions are in the Assyrian dialect of Akkadian and Aramaic, the earliest Aramaic inscription.Millard and BordreuilAbu Asaf, Bordreuil and Millard The statue, a standing figure wearing a tunic, is made of basalt and is 2 meters tall including the base. The two inscriptions are on the skirt of the tunic, with the Akkadian inscription (38 lines) on the front and the Aramaic inscription (23 lines) on the back. The text is most likely based on an Aramaic prototype.Greenfield and Shaffer, p.109 It is the earliest known Aramaic inscription,ARAMAIC IN THE ACHAEMENIAN EMPIRE The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 2, Cambridge University Press, 1985 and is known as KAI 309. The statue was inscribed as a votive object to Hadad, whose name the donor bore. It is generally dated to around 850 BC, though an 11th-century BC date has also been proposed.J. Naveh, The Date of the Tell Fekherye Inscription, Shnaton 5-6, pp. 130-140, 1978-79 Inscription Translation The inscription was carved in the two languages: Akkadian and Aramaic. The two versions are closely related in the beginning, however the second half has more differences. The following translation is based on the Akkadian version: To Adad, the canal inspector of heaven and earth, who causes it to rain abundance, who gives well-watered pastures to the people of all cities, and who provides portions of food offering to the gods, his brothers, inspector of the rivers who makes the whole world flourish, the merciful god to whom it to whom it is sweet to pray, he who resides in the city Guzana.

It was the largest of its type in Bergisches Land and was owned by the Jung family between 1835 and 1869, when it also included a textile school. Location The name Hammerstein can be traced to the in Vohwinkel, now part of Wuppertal, Germany. Wuppertal in its present borders was formed in 1929 by merging the early industrial settlements of Barmen and Elberfeld with Vohwinkel, Ronsdorf, Cronenberg, Langerfeld, and Beyenburg. The initial name of the town, Barmen- Elberfeld, was changed in a 1930 referendum to Wuppertal (‚ÄúWupper Valley‚Äù). The Hammerstein manor house controlled much of the valley floor of the Wupper. In 1825 it gave its name to the in , that still stands on the Hammersteiner Allee, and to a station of the suspension railway. Sonnborn itself gave its name to the on the autobahn 46 and autobahn 535.  History  Downhill from the Villa Hammerstein, the businessman Johann Christian Jung built the weaving sheds and the cotton mill Baumwollspinnerei Hammerstein alongside the Wupper between 1835 and 1837. He included workers accommodation in the form of an apartment block. Other sources attribute the formation to Friedrich August Jung. Hella Nu√übaum, Hermann J.

She is best known for her research on the evolving lives of women, from the 19th century women's rights movements to women's contemporary work and family roles. In addition, her publications include the methodology of life course research and the history and growth of American family policy. She has written or edited ten books and authored numerous articles, a body of work that has been widely cited in her field.  Biography  Giele grew up in Wooster, Ohio and graduated from Wooster High School in 1952. She earned her BA from Earlham College in 1956 as First Honor Student (valedictorian). During her junior year, 1954‚Äì1955, she studied in Paris with a Barrett Scholarship from Earlham College and received a Certificat from L'Institut d'Etudes Politiques. Her 1961 PhD in sociology from Radcliffe College (of Harvard University) examined changes in the feminine role by comparing temperance and suffrage women's lives and ideology. This work was later published as Two Paths to Women's Equality.  Academic work  From 1962 to 1970, Giele taught sociology at Wellesley College. In 1970 she became a fellow of the Bunting Institute at Radcliffe College. As a Senior Fellow at the Institute from 1972‚Äì1975, she served as Principal Consultant to the Ford Foundation's Task Force on Rights and Responsibilities of Women. Her first two books were the result of this work. Women: Roles and Status in Eight Countries, which she co- edited, uses a framework that she devised to analyze the status of women in six dimensions: family formation, duration, and size; education; employment; family planning and health; political expression; and cultural expression. She found that the status of women is closer to that of men when social organization is very simple or highly complex. In peasant societies, the status of women is reduced relative to that of men and rises again with modernization. A review in Contemporary Sociology criticizes the book for not adequately explaining why women's status improves, either with further modernization, or in revolutionary societies that are not very complex. According to the reviewer the book should have given more weight to the role of women in reproduction and to Marxist feminist theorists linking class and sex discrimination. The same reviewer praises the book as a valuable and high quality comparative study suitable for readings in women studies. Giele's work on the changing lives of women led her to the field of life course research. In Methods of Life Course Research (1998) she collaborated with her co-editor Glen H. Elder to articulate a theory of life course development. She also reported findings from her 1980s study of women graduates of Oberlin, Spelman, and Wellesley College. In The Craft of Life Course Research (2009) she demonstrates how four key background factors (identity, social networks, personal drive, and adaptive style) differ in white and African-American college-educated women who become either full-time homemakers, or who combine family and career. In 2003, Giele coauthored the book Women and Equality in the Workplace: A Reference Handbook, described by one reviewer as \\"an authoritative reference work ... for any serious collection where questions of women's equality in the workplace need to be answered.\\" Giele's interest in changing roles of women led to her work on the growth of family policy. In 1974 her exploratory research was funded by the National Science Foundation. Between 1976 and 2004 she taught a graduate level course on Family and Children's Policy at the Heller School for Social Policy at Brandeis University and was the founding director of its Family and Children's Policy Center. Her many years of linking sociological insights to pressing policy concerns such as child poverty, disability, work-life balance, and elder care led to her massive overview of social policy that appears in Family Policy and the American Safety Net. This work provides a theoretical and historical framework that shows how all social policy is ultimately family policy. From Medicare to Social Security to home mortgage regulations to immigration reform, major social programs are in the last analysis meant to promote individual well-being and the common good by helping families to carry out their basic functions of caregiving, income provision, shelter, and transmission of citizenship. Honors and awards She has received fellowships from the Woodrow Wilson, Ford, and Rockefeller Foundations, the German Marshall Fund, and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Radcliffe College made her an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa. Her research has been supported by the National Institutes of Mental Health, the Lilly Endowment, the National Institute on Aging, and the Rockefeller Foundation. Earlham College gave her its Outstanding Alumni Award and Radcliffe its Graduate Society Medal, honoring women who have earned a Radcliffe or Harvard Graduate degree and have made an outstanding contribution to their field. In 2004 the Heller School recognized her teaching of doctoral students with its first Mentoring Award. In 2013, Pepperdine University established the Janet Zollinger Giele Distinguished Life Course Award to recognize women who have overcome significant obstacles to become leaders in their chosen field.  Personal Life and Community Service  Giele is married to David L. Giele and has two children. She has served as a lay leader in her church, as a member of Wellesley Town Meeting, an alumni trustee of Earlham College, and Acting Dean of the Heller School. She has lectured at more than 50 colleges and universities in the U.S. and abroad. From 2009-2012 she was the founding president of Wellesley Neighbors, a membership organization that is part of the national village movement which helps midlife and older adults continue to live independently.

Boyne, ‚ÄòHastings, Hubert de Cronin (1902‚Äì1986)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 9 June 2014 was chairman of the Architectural Press and editor of Architectural Review and Architects' Journal.  Early life and family  Hastings was born at Merton, Surrey, on 18 July 1902, the third son of Percy Hastings, proprietor of Architectural Press and founder of Architectural Review, and his wife Lilian Julie, n√©e Bass.Obituary, The Daily Telegraph, 8 December 1986. Published in Massingberd, H. (1995) The Daily Telegraph Book of Obituaries, Pan Books. He was educated at Berkhamsted School, and worked first for his father's company before enrolling at Bartlett School of Architecture, part of University College, London. Disenchanted with the course's beaux arts leanings, he moved to UCL's art school, the Slade, where he was influenced heavily by cubism. On 23 July 1927, Hastings married Hazel Rickman Garrard, a daughter of Charles Frederick GarrardGeneral Register Office, England and Wales Civil Registration Indexes, Q3, vol. 6d, p. 2193 and had two children with her: a son, John Hastings, and a daughter, Priscilla Hastings.  Early years as editor  In 1927, Hastings took over (alongside Christian Berman) the editing of Architectural Review and Architect's Journal; he set about rearranging the format, including changes in typography and image (for which he commissioned artwork from Eric Gill), but also the content. From then on, the weekly Journal would be concerned with practical architecture, while the monthly Review was concerned with architecture as an art, regularly featuring articles on painting, sculpture, interior design and architectural history. In the following years, he employed a new generation of writers to contribute to the publications, including Osbert Lancaster, Robert Byron, Evelyn Waugh, Cyril Connolly, Sacheverell Sitwell, P. Morton Shand and (from 1930) John Betjeman; during the Second World War, Nikolaus Pevsner assisted, while J. M. Richards was serving in the armed forces. Hastings was known to have had difficult working relationships with some of these young writers he employed. Betjeman's relationship with Hastings was largely amicable, though at times, as Hasting's Telegraph obituary states, \\"Betjeman was openly impatient of the petty rules imposed by the management\\" and nicknamed him \\"Old Obscurity\\". Although rarely contributing articles, he is known to have written several, under the pseudonym Ivor de Wolfe. He also authored The Alternative Society (1980), as well as a caricature book produced during his art-school years. As an individual, he was a \\"romantic\\" and an \\"idealist\\", but also a \\"perfectionist.\\" He rarely talked publicly and was known to go on vacations without announcement and miss editorial meetings, returning, though, with a new draft article or photographs of continental cities.  Later years and legacy  Throughout the 1930s, he promoted modernism, with the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography commenting that he \\"saw the logic of this as a bright new future for society\\", although he later campaigned for 'new monumentalism' and 'new empiricism', before going on to favour the \\"picturesque\\" in town planning, in reaction to the more rigid axial-planning which was fashionable at the time amongst architectural circles; this led to his promotion of the notion of \\"township\\" and his criticism of poor planning in British architecture. A special publication of the Review which highlighted his criticisms was produced and influenced the creation of the Civic Trust. In recognition of his service to architecture in Britain, he became the first architectural editor to receive the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture from the Royal Institute of British Architects; their citation described him as a \\"leading campaigner in drawing attention to many of the most crucial and controversial issues that have concerned the architectural profession in this century.\\" Hastings died on 4 December 1986 at Bedham Farm, Fittleworth, Sussex; he was cremated and his ashes interred at Bedham.

The game had been scheduled to be released in 2017 for Xbox One and Microsoft Windows, with Microsoft Studios publishing the title. Microsoft announced the cancellation of Scalebounds development in January 2017. In the game, players would assume control of Drew, who is accompanied by a dragon called Thuban. Players could use a variety of weapons to defeat enemies, and could issue commands to the dragon, which assisted players during battles. Unlike other games developed by PlatinumGames, the game was to put more focus on graphical qualities and the role-playing aspect instead of action. Gameplay Scalebound was an action role-playing video game played in a third-person perspective, in which players assumed control of Drew, as he progressed through the world of Draconis. Players are accompanied by a dragon called Thuban, who would assist Drew throughout the game. Drew and Thuban are bonded together, and Thuban's death would cause Drew to die as well and vice versa. Thuban is usually controlled by artificial intelligence, but players can give commands to the dragon when performing attacks. Drew can enter the Dragon Link mode, allowing the player to directly control the dragon from his perspective. In this mode, the perspective would shift to first-person, and Drew is very vulnerable to attacks. There are three types of dragons, each with different characteristics. The three types can be blended together through the game's customization options and the dragon's abilities, appearances and armor can be modified by the player. The dragon can be ridden, though not in the beginning of the game, and they can perform a special elemental attack with the berserker mode. The player can upgrade abilities by using the gems that enemies dropped sometimes. In addition, players are equipped with melee weapons, such as swords and ranged weapons like explosive arrows and guns. These weapons will eventually become degraded and lose their durability during combat. The game does not feature any crafting system, but players can obtain different weapons throughout the game. When encountering large enemies, players can swing to them and climb on them to perform attacks. Drew has a dragon arm, which can scan enemies for information, unleash pulse energy, and heal his dragon companion. The player can shapeshift into a half-dragon hybrid. When he shapeshifts, his abilities will be significantly strengthened. Players can gain skill points, which can be used to level-up Drew, by defeating enemies and taking care of Thuban like healing and assisting him in battle. Additional skill points would have given if players can defeat multiple enemies consecutively. The game also features a four-player co- operative multiplayer mode. Development Scalebound was under development by PlatinumGames. The concept for the game was created when Platinum established in 2006 but the studio decided to move to develop Bayonetta instead of making Scalebound. The studio attempted to re-pitch the game again after the completion of Bayonetta, and a prototype was made but it failed to generate any interest, and the studio moved on to develop The Wonderful 101. When the development of The Wonderful 101 was almost finished, the idea for Scalebound was revised, and the game's development officially began in 2013. Director Hideki Kamiya considered the game a new experience for the studio, as it was something that they had never worked on before. The studio hoped that they could create a game whose gameplay would have been unlike any other game previously developed by Platinum. Kamiya described it as a big challenge for the studio. He also considered the collaboration between Platinum and Microsoft a leap forward for the studio. According to him, Bayonetta-styled action and reflexes is not the core focus of the game, but he promised that the game's combat \\"will remain at the quality that‚Äôs always defined [Platinum's] action games\\". The team put more emphasis on graphics and visual quality to create a game that is \\"photo-realistic\\". The game was designed to be more accessible for new players and the team hoped that the game's fantasy setting can introduce it to a wider audience. Platinum also consulted Microsoft's user research labs to ensure that the game would suit the taste of a broad audience. Scalebound would be the first action role-playing game developed by Platinum. Kamiya described the game as a dream come true for him, as he had always wanted to create a game where dragons are the players' companion as opposed to being enemies. In order to add a twist to the game's world and prevent it from being too typical, the team introduced Drew, a young man who comes from the modern world, to contrast with the fantasy setting of the game. The bonding between the game's protagonist and the dragon was not originally planned. Kamiya's original vision was to have monsters fighting against each other. However, they decided to add that later on because they wanted to increase player participation in the game. In order to tackle the problem of having two lead characters in a game, they focused the story on Drew and the gameplay on Thuban. As a result, Thuban can be customized extensively, while Drew cannot. Instead of the dragon, Platinum originally hoped to feature dinosaurs in the game, although the idea was later scrapped. It was once intended to be a dinosaur game, in which players can issue commands to other dinosaurs, for the Wii console. Kamiya cited the 1987 Dragon Slayer action role-playing game Sorcerian as inspiration, including its fantasy theme, \\"gigantic monsters,\\" different scenarios, \\"expansive possibilities\\", \\"tons of adventures\\" and enemies such as a hydra boss and \\"lots of amazing dragons\\". He also cited the 1987 PC-8801 MA release of the action role-playing game Hydlide 3, noting the influence of its \\"hardcore game design\\", as well as the dragons of the role-playing video game Dragon Quest. The game's world, Draconis, features a giant mushroom that grows extensively. Pulse energy emanates from it that serves as the life foundation of every existing creature in the game. According to Yong-hee Cho, the game's art director, the Pulse took inspiration from the Force of Star Wars fame. Draconis is described to be non-linear which encourages exploration. When designing the game's world, the team hoped to strike a balance between realism and imagination. As a result, 80% of the game's world would be based on earth's landscape, while the remaining 20% would be environments shaped by the Pulse energy. According to Cho, when he first pitched his original enemy designs to Kamiya, they were rejected because they were considered to be too exaggerated. Kamiya later said that he wanted the enemies to be more realistic. In addition, the difficulty of enemies is not scaled according to Drew's strength and level, as Platinum hoped that without scaled difficulty, players can experience a sense of victory when they return to earlier areas to defeat easier enemies. Despite that, enemies behaviors change during the second encounter. The initial deal between PlatinumGames and Microsoft was facilitated by agent Ben Judd. The game was officially announced at Microsoft Studios' press conference at E3 2014 with a cinematic trailer. The game missed E3 2015, but the game's gameplay was shown at Gamescom 2015, alongside Crackdown 3 and Quantum Break. The game's four-player co-operative multiplayer mode was also announced. Scalebound was set to be released worldwide for the Xbox One in late 2016 but was later delayed to 2017. The game's cancellation was announced on January 9, 2017. Reflecting on the game's cancellation in May 2019, Platinum studio head Atsushi Inaba said it ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt easy‚Äù to see publisher Microsoft receive criticism for the decision as he felt ‚Äúboth sides failed,‚Äù and that ultimately, the game ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt do all of the things that we needed to do as a developer‚Äù. In February 2020, Inaba said that while Scalebound remains a intellectual property fully owned by Microsoft, PlatinumGames would want to return to it if given the opportunity to.

The company has two data storytelling products, Quill and Lexio, which aim to help businesses understand their data and the story behind it.  History  Narrative Science was founded in 2010 in Evanston, Illinois, after a student project in the Intelligent Information Lab at Northwestern University jump started the NLG technology. The first prototype of the company technology went by the project name StatsMonkey and was developed in the laboratory by Kris Hammond, Larry Birnbaum, Nick Allen and John Templon. StatsMonkey was created to disrupt the journalism industry by allowing stories based in data, specifically baseball stories at the beginning, to be written automatically by StatsMonkey. These baseball stories would include recaps based on game data like players, win probability and game score. Narrative Science licensed StatsMonkey and the related intellectual property from Northwestern and began commercial operations in early 2010. Afterwards the company decided to change direction, they no longer focused on the journalistic capabilities of their technology and focused on how the same technology could be used in the business world. This led to the development of a Natural Language Generation platform called Quill, which analyzes structured data and automatically generates intelligent narratives for business users who are not data fluent. Narrative Science has several investors, including SAP and In-Q-Tel, the investment arm of the Central Intelligence Agency. In 2014, the Chicago company raised another $10 million in equity financing, led by customer USAA, for a total of $32 million raised since the company‚Äôs inception. In 2020, Narrative Science launched Data Storytelling for Good, their non-profit branch which provides their products for free to organizations doing good in their community.  Products  = Lexio = Lexio is a language-based augmented analytics product that turns business data into interactive plain-English stories. Lexio integrates with many data sources companies use daily, including Salesforce, Google Analytics, Marketo and many others, to provide actionable insights for those with limited data analytics abilities. = Quill = Quill is an intelligent automation platform that allows enterprise organizations to change how they do internal and external reporting by using natural language generation. Utilizing artificial intelligence, Quill's platform creates custom NLG applications that mimic the logic, language, analytics, and formatting of reports that typically require an analyst to create. Enterprise organizations across finance, compliance, risk, analytics and more, use Quill to automate high-volume and time-consuming reporting workflows. Quill also adds a story to the typical corporate dashboard. Quill digests data and writes a quick couple of paragraphs to explain what is happening in the graphs and charts it neighbors. Out-of-the- box extensions with Tableau, Qlik, and PowerBI embed plain-English commentary in dashboards to help tell a story with data. Additionally, partnerships with MicroStrategy and Sisense integrate NLG directly in their software.  Recognition  In 2017, Fortune listed Narrative Science as one of the 50 companies leading the artificial intelligence revolution. In 2015, CNBC named Narrative Science to their Disruptor 50 list. Gartner named Narrative Science as one of the ‚ÄúCool Vendors in Smart Machines‚Äù in 2014. In 2013, the company was named to the Red Herring Top 100 for North America, which highlights promising startups in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Narrative Science won a 2013 Edison Award for Innovative Services in Collaboration and Knowledge Management. In 2018, Narrative Science was part of the World Economic Forum's Technology Pioneers. In 2018, Narrative Science won Crain's Most Innovative Company.  Competitors  According to Gartner's 2019 \\"Market Guide for NLG\\", the main NLG companies are (in alphabetical order): Arria NLG, Automated Insights, AX Semantics, Narrative Science and Yseop. Other similar companies in the area of natural language generation include Smartologic, Retresco, United Robots and Linguastat.  Criticism  The company received some early criticism from journalists speculating that Narrative Science was attempting to eliminate the jobs of writers, particularly in sports and finance. Critics also argue that biases and assumptions in original data sets can lead to reinforced bias in the stories generated by natural language processors, such as Narrative Science. A CBS article compared artificially generated journalism in the financial sector to the property market bubble, as it leads to ‚Äúeveryone making investments in the same way for the same reasons‚Äù. The article claimed that computer-generated narratives have the ‚Äúpotential to amplify biases and assumptions, but at far greater speed and on a far wider scale than anything written by humans.‚Äù An article from the Columbia Journalism School also criticized the limitations of ‚Äúrobo-journalism‚Äù software, as ‚Äúit can‚Äôt assess the damage on the ground, can‚Äôt interview experts, and can‚Äôt discern the relative newsworthiness of various aspects of the story‚Äù and therefore, lacks a necessary human element.

It continues the series nine years after the release of 2010's Xbox 360 video game Crackdown 2. Originally set to be released in 2016, the game was delayed a number of times. The game was released on 15 February 2019 and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the return of its core features from its predecessors and level of enjoyment, but was also criticized for a lack of innovation and dated design. Gameplay Crackdown 3 retains the core gameplay of Crackdown and Crackdown 2, featuring a number of different organizations controlling the city of New Providence that players need to take down by killing their bosses and Kingpins, destroying their facilities, and destabilizing their infrastructures. Players can use a variety of weapons to achieve this end, from guns to grenades to rocket launchers, as well as their own physical power. Players can also drive any vehicle found in-game. Picking up a new weapon or driving a new vehicle for the first time will add it to the player's collection at any supply point. The game features the \\"Skills for Kills\\" system as found in previous games, in which killing enemies with different tools and finding pickups hidden throughout the city award the player with orbs, which increase the player's core skills ‚Äì agility, firearms, strength, explosives, and driving. Each time a skill levels up, the player unlocks an additional maneuver or item related to that skill, such as ground- pounding by leveling up strength, or double-jumping by leveling up agility. Agility Orbs, Rooftop Races, Driving Rings, and Road Races are also located throughout the city, all of which will increase the related skill upon collection or completion; Hidden Orbs can be found as well, and will increase all of the player's skills at once. Different activities are connected to different bosses and underbosses; completing these activities, such as destroying vehicle lockups, liberating monorail stations, and destroying machinery, allows the player to acquire more intel on each boss, and the player may confront a boss once enough intel has been collected. The boss of each branch of TerraNova controls a certain element of defense for the final boss, and killing each of them weakens an aspect of the final boss's fortress. However, causing a certain level of chaos towards one branch of the organization will send more and more reinforcements from that branch as the player's heat level increases, and being at the highest level for too long can result in a city-wide lockdown, forcing the player to kill a certain number of reinforcements to lift it and access their supply points again. Crackdown 3 features cooperative play in both campaign mode and Keys to the City mode, which allows free roam throughout New Providence. =Crackdown 3: Wrecking Zone= Another new element to the series is the inclusion of destructible environments in a competitive multiplayer mode, Wrecking Zone, in which nearly the entire map is destructible. However, the mode was quickly abandoned. Wrecking Zone has since been described as \\"dead\\".https://screenrant.com/crackdown-3-multiplayer-mode-failure/ Plot Ten years after the events of Crackdown 2, a massive terrorist attack from an unknown source cuts electrical power around the entire world. The Agency is thrust back into action after the attack is traced to the city of New Providence, controlled by the mysterious but sinister corporation TerraNova, led by Elizbeth Niemand; New Providence is the only city that still has power. The player characters - super-powered Agents - are called into the field by Agency Director Charles Goodwin (Michael McConnohie) and led by Commander Isaiah Jaxon (Terry Crews) to drop into New Providence and dismantle Terra Nova any way they can. As Jaxon briefs the agents of their mission, their drop ship is attacked by TerraNova, resulting in the deaths of everyone on board. Echo, a member of the New Providence rebel group known as the Militia, recovers the remains of one of the agents and regenerates them. Heavily outnumbered by TerraNova‚Äôs forces, Echo enlists the agent's help in fighting back by dismantling TerraNova's infrastructure - Logistics, Science, and Enforcement. As the agent fights TerraNova, they discover that the Science branch of TerraNova has been mining a mysterious green mineral called Chimera, which Goodwin deduces is responsible for the power outage - Chimera reportedly consumes electrical power. The agent also investigates the mysterious disappearance of many New Providence citizens, discovering they have been kidnapped by TerraNova in an attempt to brainwash and create an army of genetically enhanced super-soldiers. Audio logs found throughout the game allow the agent to learn the existence of an anonymous client who reportedly paid TerraNova to perform their Eventually, the agent assaults Elizabeth Niemand's tower and ascends to the top, where they confront Niemand, who is piloting a massive Chimera-powered dragon mech; Neimand states her desire to use the Vitalis project to make herself immortal. The agent destroys the dragon mech, killing Niemand. In the aftermath, Goodwin offers Echo a position at the Agency, which she accepts. An agent's severed arm suspended in a Vitalis tank is then seen as the voice of the anonymous client addresses the agent, stating that the Agency is the next step in the evolution of Chimera. Development Crackdown 3 was announced at Microsoft's press conference at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014 in June 2014, as an Xbox One exclusive. While the game was still at an early stage at the time of its reveal, Microsoft's Phil Spencer said that the title came about from talks with Dave Jones who, after leaving Realtime Worlds, joined Cloudgine, a software company that is developing technology allowing game developers to take advantage of cloud computing features. Cloudgine had been previously rumored to be a core part of the Xbox One software, with their software used in a technology demonstration at a Microsoft developer's conference in April 2014, demonstrating the use of cloud computer to speed up the physics modeling and rendering in a fully destructible city environment. Spencer revealed that the demo world was the start of this newest Crackdown title, with ability to destroy any part of the city expected to be carried over to the final game. According to Spencer, Cloudgine would help to develop the core engine, while Reagent Games, a studio located in close proximity to Cloudgine also founded by Jones, would develop the gameplay and art assets for the game, with Sumo Digital developing the game's campaign mode and Elbow Rocket (with assistance from Crackdown 2 developers Ruffian Games) developing the multiplayer. Microsoft Studios' creative director Ken Lobb asserted that the game would only be called Crackdown instead of Crackdown 3, stating that the game is set in the future of the first game but represents an alternate timeline from what Crackdown 2 provided. The game was officially revealed as Crackdown 3 during Microsoft's Gamescom 2015 press conference on 4 August 2015. The focus on cloud-powered real time destruction was first demonstrated there, and Jones stated that Microsoft's cloud computing technology provides twenty times more power than playing the game on a single Xbox One console. Because of the game's reliance to Microsoft Azure for destruction engine, the full scale destruction will only be available in the game's online multiplayer modes, while campaign mode, regardless of number of players, will only have access to limited degree of destruction. In January 2018, Epic Games acquired Cloudgine, and with that, Jones left Reagent to join Epic Games. Polygon reported at the same time that several Reagent programmers also left to go to Epic. During an interview at E3 2018, Microsoft Studio's Matt Booty stated that Sumo Digital was now the principal developer on Crackdown 3. Jones confirmed that in terms of development, Sumo Digital had always been the principal developer for the game; Cloudgine was there to help support cloud computing, with Reagent established as a consulting firm to allow Jones to help Sumo determine the direction to take Crackdown 3. Jones did not believe there was any stumbling blocks due with Cloudgine, Reagent, or himself leaving the development at that point, since they had done what they had needed for cloud computing support, and considered that now, \\"it's just the technology stack, it's pretty straightforward\\" for Sumo to complete. Despite their departures during development, both Cloudgine and Reagent were still credited in the game's packaging and on the end credits. The game features a Dolby Atmos soundtrack.https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2017/11/13/xbox-one-x-windows-sonic- dolby-atmos-feature/ =Delays= Crackdown 3 was set to be released worldwide in 2016, which was changed to 7 November 2017 simultaneously with the Xbox One X, but another delay was announced on 16 August 2017, moving the release back to an unspecified Q2/Q3 2018 date. In June 2018, the game was confirmed to be delayed again, pushing back to February 2019. Reception Crackdown 3 received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. IGN noted the lack of innovation stating, \\"Crackdown 3 delivers on what made the original an enjoyable game, but never much more.\\" Destructoid was also disappointed with the evolution of the series and wrote, \\"Crackdown 3 is a good Crackdown game, which, unfortunately, doesn't mean much anymore. Modern game design has surpassed the Crackdown model by leaps and bounds\\". EGMNow wrote of the game, \\"It‚Äôs a blast when you just feel like zoning out, hunting orbs, jumping across rooftops, and blowing up bad guys\\" and closed by saying, \\"It‚Äôs good, solid fun, but it‚Äôs not going to completely revolutionize the industry.\\" PC Gamer wrote, \\"Crackdown 3 comes along 12 years after Crackdown but without 12 years' worth of new ideas to share\\" and finished by saying, \\"It's an OK game that could've been exciting a decade ago.\\" The Verge referred to Crackdown 3 as \\"the Netflix Original of games\\", by stating: \\"You know when there‚Äôs a show you really like, but then it dips in quality and eventually gets canceled, and the creators say they want to make a new season someday or maybe a remake, but it‚Äôs stuck in production hell for several years, then Netflix or whoever sinks a bunch of money into it, and it eventually gets released and it‚Äôs not quite as good as you remember the original, but it‚Äôs still pretty entertaining and hey, you‚Äôre paying for Netflix anyway so you‚Äôre not going to complain about getting it for 'free?'

Havlovicky noticed a strange-coloured deposit flowing into the Metuje river from the spring. Deeming that the water had curative properties, Jir√°sek's father (owner of the property on which the springs were discovered) had, by 1869, built a spa with bathing facilities filled with water from the springs. The spa eventually became defunct, but was restored by the city authorities during World War II.

For example, its alkaline reaction is said to decompose kidney, urinary and gall bladder stones. In addition to iron, the spring water also contains calcium, magnesium, iodine and sulphur, which gives it a strong smell, and sodium and potassium ions. The water is also high in arsenic acid, which locals say acts against the initial stages of sclerosis, high blood pressure and body fatigue.

The Fiat 850 Lucciola was also used by Spain's SEAT for their 850 four-door sedan, although eventually they developed their own, longer version. Francis Lombardi Fiat 850 Lucciola At the end of the sixties, the Lombardi Grand Prix appeared, the closest thing to an independent design from the firm. This model had a convoluted history and was sold in small numbers under a variety of names until 1972, fitted with Fiat engines in various states of tune. Francis Lombardi continued to focus on modifying cars as well, building coup√©s on Fiat as well as on NSU basis (1000 TTS). In the 1970s they made special versions of the Fiat 128 and Lancia 2000, but in 1973 their doors were closed for good. Ten years later, Carlo Lombardi died.

Edward was the son of George Guest and Kitty Ray Wickson, the grandson of James and Jane Tuesman Wickson, immigrants to Canada in 1834. Biography Edward James Wickson was born on August 3, 1848, in Rochester, New York. He graduated from Hamilton College, New York, in 1868 or 1869 with distinction in classics and chemistry. After graduation, he joined his father's agricultural tools factory, but it was destroyed by fire in 1870, ruining the family's finances. In 1871, he joined the staff of the Utica Morning Herald, a champion of the state's cheese industry. This position led to his election as the secretary of the New York Dairymen's Association (1871) and as president of the Utica Dairymen's Board of Trade (1873). His expertise in matters pertaining to the dairy industry was such that in 1874 and 1875 he was chosen to speak to state dairymen's conventions from New England to the Midwest. In 1875, Wickson moved to California to join the Pacific Rural Press (which later merged with California Farmer magazine). He became a special contributor in 1894 and was promoted to editor in 1899, a position he held until 1923. During his tenure at Pacific Rural Press, he wrote widely on the agricultural topics of the day and published several encyclopedic books on growing fruit and vegetable crops that remain useful resources for farmers. He also wrote on historical topics, such as the roots of the state's agriculture in the Spanish mission system, and he wrote various bulletins for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Wickson was an advocate for the experimental horticulturist Luther Burbank and wrote about him in Luther Burbank; Man, Methods and Achievements, published in book form in 1902. They had both come to California in 1875, and they knew of each other very soon thereafter. By the 1880s, Wickson was praising Burbank's hybrids in the pages of Pacific Rural Press, so much so that Burbank renamed his green Perfection plum to the Wickson plum in 1894. Wickson is credited with being one of the two men (the other being former Stanford University president David Starr Jordan) who helped created the legend of Burbank as one of the great self-taught leaders of modern agricultural science. Wickson is also said to be one of the half dozen authors who anonymously wrote the text for the 12-volume set Luther Burbank: His Methods and Discoveries, published by the Luther Burbank Press in 1914‚Äì15. Originally named the Perfection, this 1883 plum variety was subsequently rechristened the Wickson in honor of Edward J. Wickson. Its ancestors were the Kelsey and the Burbank. The Wickson plum remains available today, although modern cultivars range from red-skinned to green-skinned. In 1876, Wickson organized California's first dairy association, and in 1879 he became one of the organizers of the California State Horticultural Society. He was elected secretary of the horticultural society, a position he held for 15 years. At the founding of the California Floral Society in 1888, Wickson was chosen as its first president; when he stepped down, he retained the title of honorary president. In 1879, he joined the University of California as a lecturer in practical agriculture, specializing in dairy husbandry. All told, he worked in the UC system for 33 years, rising from lecturer to assistant professor of agriculture (in 1891), associate professor of agriculture, horticulture, and entomology (in 1892), professor of agricultural practice (in 1897) and superintendent of the Agricultural Extension service (in 1898). In 1906 he succeeded Eugene W. Hilgard as dean of the College of Agriculture, and he also became director of the Agricultural Experiment Station, holding both positions until his retirement in 1912. He was also an emeritus professor of horticulture from 1915 to 1923. In 1905‚Äì06, he helped to select the sites for what became the University Farm at Davisville (now Davis), the Southern California Pathological Laboratory at Whittier, and the Citrus Experiment Station at Riverside. Throughout his career in both agricultural publishing and education, he retained a strong bias towards knowledge gained in the field over laboratory-oriented forms of training. At the same time, he and Hilgard are credited as halting determined efforts by the Grange and other agricultural interests that would have split the College of Agriculture off from the University of California system. Watercolor of the Wickson Plum by Deborah Griscom Passmore, 1896 From 1877 to 1906, he was a member (and later secretary and president) of the San Francisco Microscopical Society, an organization that championed the emerging use of microscopy for scientific research. The society went defunct after its laboratory was destroyed in the 1906 earthquake. In 1913, Wickson spent six months in Europe as one of two California delegates on the American Commission to Study Agricultural Cooperation and Rural Credit in Europe. Around 1919, Wickson consulted with real estate developer J.C. Forkner (eventual founder of the J.C. Forkner Fig Gardens) on the potential of fig farming as a viable commercial enterprise in California. He died in Berkeley, California, on July 17, 1923. His papers are held in the University of California, Davis, Special Collections. In 1969, the University of California, Berkeley, named an area of the campus around the north fork of Strawberry Creek as the Wickson Natural Area in his honor. This area contains the oldest stand of coast redwoods on the Berkeley campus.

At the age of three, his family moved to Haifa, where he grew up and went to the Hebrew Reali School. Upon graduation, he entered the Israeli Navy and subsequently served as an officer on a missile boat.  Academic career  After majoring in East Asian Studies and psychology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, he studied for a year at the Free University of Berlin and then for six years at the University of Tsukuba in Japan. Upon receiving his PhD, he continued in postdoctoral studies at the Center for East Asian Studies, Stanford University, and at the Hebrew University. In 1998 he began teaching at the University of Haifa as a senior lecturer and was promoted to professor in 2004.Kowner, p. 567 Kowner worked extensively to mark the centenary of the Russo-Japanese War and to stress its regional and global repercussions.David Schimmelpenninck van der Oye, Journal of Slavic Military Studies 20 (2007), p. 775 He was involved in organizing international conferences, initiated collaborative works, and published several books as well as many articles about this topic. Since 2010, his research focus has shifted to the examination of the development of race and racism in modern East Asia and in Japan in particular. Kowner maintains that the question of race, the distress over foreign racism, and the implementation of racist policies in its own colonies have been among the most critical and painful issues in the history of modern Japan and that they were also among the determinants of its national decision-making, at least until the end of World War II. Kowner has been as a visiting professor at Tokyo's Waseda University, the University of Geneva, and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and serves on the editorial board of several academic journals.

Wards in dark grey were not contested in 2014. The 2014 Pendle Borough Council election took place on 22 May 2014 to elect members of Pendle Borough Council in Lancashire, England. One third of the council was up for election and the council stayed under no overall control. After the election, the composition of the council was *Conservative 19 *Labour 18 *Liberal Democrats 11 *British National Party 1 Background Before the election the Conservatives had 19 councillors, the most for the party on the council for the previous 30 years, while Labour had 17 councillors, the Liberal Democrats had 12 and there was 1 British National Party councillor. This was a change from the situation at the last election in 2012, after Labour councillor Abdul Aziz had defected to the Conservatives in September 2013 after having been suspended by Labour. The council was run by the Conservatives, with support from the Liberal Democrats. 16 seats were contested at the election, with Labour defending 6 seats, the Conservatives 5, Liberal Democrats 4 and the British National Party 1. Among those defending seats at the election was the leader of the Labour group on the council, Mohammed Iqbal in Bradley ward. During the campaign Pendle was visited by the Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron, both the Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman and the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, and the Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander to support their respective parties. Election result There was little change in the party composition of the council with Labour gaining one seat from the Conservatives, while the Conservatives took one seat from the Liberal Democrats. Labour's gain came in Reedley, where Yasser Iqbal defeated the Conservative councillor for the previous 40 years, Pauline McCormick, by 36 votes. However Conservative Lyle Davy became the youngest councillor in the country at the age of 18 after taking Coates from the Liberal Democrats by 49 votes, after the Liberal Democrats had held the ward for the previous 16 years. Meanwhile, Brian Parker held Marsden for the British National Party by 6 votes over the Conservatives, in the only seat won by the British National Party at the 2014 United Kingdom local elections. Overall turnout at the election was 38.82%. Following the election Conservative Joe Cooney continued as leader of the council after the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats reached an agreement, with the Conservatives taking 6 seats on the council executive, while the Liberal Democrats took 4 seats on the executive.

Origins This all-male club began in New York City in March 1834, under the leadership of Henry Highland Garnet, William H. Day, and David Ruggles. 150 African-American youths, all under 20, gathered in a public school for its first meeting. Controversy with name The inclusion of abolitionist Wm. Lloyd Garrison's name was controversial and drew immediate reactions. For example, a city official informed the young men that in order to continue using public facilities, they needed to find another name for their club. The defiant young scholars decided to keep the name and move to a private location instead. \\"The young men passed several resolutions rejecting the 'uncalled for usurpation' of authority, keeping Garrison in the title, authorizing the Executive Committee to rent a meeting room, and declaring that the name would be passed down 'to posterity.' It was then ordered that a silk society banner be painted. 'It was pleasant to hear the little ones cry -- Garrison!

He is believed to have been born in AD 612 to have become king at the age of 15. Archaeologists have recovered little evidence of activity for the first 26 years of his reign but in AD 652 there was a sudden explosion of monument production, with two stelae being erected in the Great Plaza and a further four in important locations across the Cop√°n Valley. These monuments all celebrated a k ºatun-ending. He also erected a stela at the Santa Rita site away and is mentioned on Altar L at Quirigu√° in relation to the same event in 652. It is thought that he was trying to stamp his authority throughout the whole valley after the end of some earlier restriction to his freedom to rule as he wished.Martin & Grube 2000, p.201. After this sudden spate of activity, Smoke Imix continued to rule until almost the end of the 7th century; he dedicated another 9 known monuments and made important changes to the architecture of Cop√°n, including the construction of Structure 2 which closes the northern side of the Great Plaza and a new version of Temple 26, nicknamed Chorcha. Smoke Imix ruled Cop√°n for 67 years and died on 15 June 695 at the age of 79, an age that was so distinguished that it is used to identify him in place of his name on Altar Q.

P. evansae was named in 2014 on the basis of three dentaries (bones that form the lower jaw), one from the Phosphorites du Quercy in Quercy, France and two from the Soss√≠s fossil locality in Catalonia, Spain. The paucity of known material makes its relationships uncertain; it is either a true skink in the family Scincidae or a close relative of skinks in the larger group Scincoidea. Pyrenasaurus is very small for a lizard, with a dentary length of only . It also has very few teeth for a lizard, with only eleven tooth positions in the dentary. Other unusual anatomical features include the shortness straightness of the jaw, the lack of a Meckelian groove on the inside of the dentary, and the enlargement and lateral compression of the posterior-most dentary teeth. Pyrenasaurus may have been a fossorial or burrowing lizard because a short, straight dentary with few teeth is also present in numerous living fossorial lizards, having evolved independently in many lineages. However, the extremely small size of Pyrenasaurus may have inhibited its ability to burrow. The enlarged posterior teeth of Pyrenasaurus suggest it had a specialized diet, but what it was eating remains unknown because no living lizards have similar dentitions.

As such, it was the first web series produced as a YouTube original program to become a weekly network television series. Since September 28, 2013, Recipe Rehab has aired on CBS as part of Litton's CBS Dream Team Saturday morning block; first-run episodes continued to air until July 25, 2015, with reruns airing until September 26. The television program is designed to meet educational programming requirements defined by the Federal Communications Commission. Format The program features healthy lifestyle and competition elements, with each episode featuring two competing chefs who each develop their own healthier versions of the featured family's recipe. The winning dish is determined by a panel of certified nutritionists (as of the 2014‚Äì15 season, Stephanie Clarke and Willow Jarosh, both registered dietitians with master's degrees in science) and the family featured in the given episode. Each dish is rated on a categorical score from 1 to 10, based on the total percentage of total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sugar and sodium content reduced in the \\"rehabbed\\" recipe in comparison to the original; the ease and length of preparation between the two \\"rehabbed\\" recipes (both categories are determined by the nutritionist panel); and the taste of the healthier dish (which is determined by the family). These scores are combined into the maximum cumulative score of 30, determining the chef with the episode's winning recipe. The YouTube format was an eight-minute program featuring two of three chefs ‚Äì Daniel Boome, Laura Vitale and Mareya Ibrahim ‚Äì who alternated depending on the episode. The television version is a 30-minute format, which initially saw Boome reassigned to hosting duties with three new chefs ‚Äì Calvin Harris, Candice Kumai and Tana Amen ‚Äì being brought into the rotation. After the show moved from Litton's Weekend Adventure to the CBS Dream Team in 2013, the program became hosted by Evette Rios, with Richard Rosendale and Vikki Krinsky serving as the competing chefs. Story also cited in article titled \\"Former Greenbrier chef now stars in 'Recipe Rehab'\\", published by the Associated Press on September 7, 2013. Episodes also feature multiple-choice trivia questions at the end of the first and, in some episodes, second segments regarding a particular element of nutritional value, as well as \\"food fact\\" graphics at the bottom of the screen during the preparation segments that pertain to the nutritional value, origins and uses of a particular ingredient used in the recipes. Both formats show the preparation of each dish by the two chefs ‚Äì who are given either 45 or 60 minutes to prepare the dish depending on the ease of the individual recipe, with the segments condensed due to time constraints ‚Äì during each episode; the preparation segments encompass the first two segments of the television format. In the television format, the third segment features the family preparing the dish with the ingredients and certain food preparation utensils used in the chef's recipes (which are delivered in separate red- and yellow-colored boxes ‚Äì individually colored to define each chef's recipe ‚Äì which also contain tablet computers pre-programmed with the instructions for both recipes as well as nutritional fact comparisons between the original recipe and the \\"rehabbed\\" red and yellow recipes). Deviating from the regular competition format, the television version occasionally features special \\"ask the chef\\" episodes, featuring questions submitted to one of the chefs by the children of various families that have participated in past and upcoming episodes during the taping of the at-home cooking segments about healthy food alternatives, and demonstrations of recipes preparable in approximately ten minutes. History Recipe Rehab was first launched on YouTube on April 2, 2012 as a co-production of Everyday Health and Trium Entertainment, with the initial episodes made available on the video sharing website's Everyday Health channel. The program was one of several web series directly funded by YouTube as a part of its initiative to provide premium original video content. Everyday Health wanted to move Recipe Rehab to broadcast television to allow cross-promotion between the two versions, and entered into a partnership with Litton Entertainment to produce the show as a television series. Upon its debut on October 6, 2012, the television version of the show initially aired on Litton's Weekend Adventure (a syndicated educational programming block produced by Litton for ABC's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates), replacing a self-titled series produced by Everyday Health on the block's now-defunct \\"Health and Wellness Hour\\" (consisting of health and culinary programs that filled the block's third hour during its first three seasons); this version expanded the program's format to 30 minutes. An executive for Everyday Health indicated that it was expected that Recipe Rehab would earn more revenue from product placements and similar arrangements than from advertising sales. Litton moved Recipe Rehab from Weekend Adventure to the CBS Dream Team (an educational program block formed through a time-lease agreement with Litton to program CBS' children's programming time period on Saturday mornings) upon the block's launch on September 28, 2013, for the series' second television season. Recipe Rehab was among the two programs (along with All In) that were not included on the CBS Dream Teams fall 2015 schedule when it was announced on July 30, 2015 (five days after the last episode of the series aired).

It is also called San Giacomo in Settimiano or in Settignano, due to its vicinity to Porta Settimiana, built by Septimius Severus and included by Aurelianus within the city walls. The church has medieval origins: it probably dates back to the papacy of Leo IV in 9th century. However, the former documents attesting its existence are papal bulls promulgated in 1198 and 1228, when the church was declared a branch of St. Peter's Basilica by Pope Innocent III. In 12th century Pope Innocent IV allowed it to the Sylvestrine Congregation; in 1620 the Vatican Chapter entrusted the church to the Franciscans and then to the Penitent Nuns, which, in 1644, charged Luigi Arrigucci (1575‚Äì1644) with the restoration of the building: because of these restorations, the church lost its basilican layout with three naves and became a single nave church with coffering on the ceiling. In the same period the nuns also built the annexed cloister, devoted to the prostitutes wishing to change their life; the cloister was demolished in 1887, during the building of the Lungotevere. In the same period the church, after having suffered 15 years of abandon and risked itself the destruction, was finally renovated. The towerbell Across the Lungotevere it is possible to see the Romanesque towerbell, dating back to the 12th century and the only surviving Medieval feature.

Day attended Oberlin College and graduated in 1847. He dedicated his life to the rights of Blacks in the U.S. In 1848 he was in Cleveland where he became the secretary of the National Negro Convention. Day was editor of one of the first weekly African-American newspapers, the Aliened American. Published in Cleveland, Ohio, Day used the newspaper to support the abolitionist cause, as in this excerpt from April 9, 1853: \\"We speak for Humanity. If Humanity be a unit, wherever it is cloven down, wherever rights common to human beings are infringed, there we do sympathize.\\" On November 25, 1852, Day married Lucy Stanton, an 1846 graduate of Oberlin College. In 1858 their only child was born, Florence Day. In 1858, Day abandoned his wife and child. Day and Lucy Stanton were legally divorced in 1872. In 1873, Day married Georgia F. Bell. In Cleveland, he also was compositor to the Cleveland True Democrat published by Thomas Brown and edited by John C. Vaughen, for a year when he was promoted to mailing clerk and local editor. He also taught school, teaching many subjects including Latin, Greek, mathematics, rhetoric, logic, music and vocal music, short-hand, and writing. In 1857, he went to Canada to recover from an illness and continued teaching fugitive slaves there.Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. No. 247. GM Rewell & Company, 1887. p978-984 In 1858, Day was elected president of the National Board of Commissioners of the Colored People by the Black citizens of Canada and the United States. Day was also active in the cause of the civil rights of the northern black minority. In 1858, he and his wife Lucy challenged racial segregation in public transportation in Michigan. In the 1858 case Day v. Owen, the Republican-dominated Michigan Supreme Court ruled against him and upheld segregation. In 1859 he visited England, Ireland, and Scotland with William King to raise money for a church and school house at Elgia in Buxton, Ontario. He met Martin R. Delany and Professor Campbell of the Institute for Colored Youth in London, and together the group founded the African Aid Society. He remained in Great Britain during the American Civil War (1861-1865). Back in the United States he attached himself to the Freedmen's Bureau, and in 1866 was appointed editor of the secular department of Zion's Standard and Weekly Review, a New York City Paper owned by the AME Zion church edited by Singleton T.

In 1870 he again took on a journalism role, and became editor of Our National Progress. In 1872 he returned north and became clerk in the corporation department of the auditor- general of Pennsylvania. In 1875, he succeeded James A.

Biography  Meyer Weisgal and his wife, 1957 Born in Kik√≥≈Ç, Congress Poland, in the Pale of Settlement, he emigrated to New York City, US in 1905 with his parents at age 11, where he finished high school at Morris High School in the Bronx and studied journalism at Columbia University.\\"WEISGAL, MEYER WOLF\\" He married Shirley (n√©e Hirshfeld) in 1923. In 1926, he published the first English translation of the works of Chaim Nachman Bialik. In 1932, he saw stage success with the play \\"The romance of a people\\", and he continued to produce stage plays from then on. He conceived the opera-oratorio The Eternal Road to alert the then-ignorant public to Hitler's persecution of the Jews in 1937 Germany. Weisgal enlisted the help of director Max Reinhardt, who approached Kurt Weill to write the music, and Austrian novelist and playwright Franz Werfel to write the libretto for The Eternal Road (originally in German: '), translated into English by Ludwig Lewisohn. His activities as an editor have become famous, if not legendary. Together with Louis Lipsky he edited the journal The Maccabean, later The New Palestine, which contributed its important part for the success of Chaim Weizmann's Zionist policy after the Balfour Declaration. And he, \\"as editor, conceived and published two notable supplements, which remain as permanent reference works today: In 1925 a supplement on the Hebrew University, then in establishment; in 1929 a supplement on Theodor Herzl, founder of the modern zionism\\".

Through the World Zionist Organization he came in close contact with its chair Chaim Weizmann and acted as his personal representative since 1940. In 1944, he started an initiative for expanding the Daniel Sieff Research Institute (led by Weizmann) into what would become a leading multidisciplinary research university: this opened its doors on November 2, 1949, as the Weizmann Institute of Science. He served as its Chairman of the Executive Council 1949‚Äì1966 and as its President 1966‚Äì1969. Subsequently, he served as the founding President of the Diaspora Museum in Tel-Aviv. Meyer and Shirley Weisgal lived on the grounds of the Weizmann Institute and are buried there, near the Chaim Weizmann House.

Founded in 1885, the organization grew rapidly as it added other sports and social activities, reaching its peak in the mid-1890s before financial troubles led to its bankruptcy and disestablishment in 1910. History and activities Reliance Baseball Team, c1895 The club was founded as a baseball club in 1885 in downtown Oakland. The club's focus was on developing physical fitness for its members in its gymnasium, including sports such as boxing and fencing. Football teams representing the club competed with other west coast athletic clubs, including the Olympic Club of San Francisco and the Multnomah Athletic Club of Portland, Oregon, and also played college teams, most commonly those of Stanford and California. The club was one of several in the Bay Area that trained young boxers, and the club staged regular boxing events at its facilities. In 1905, the club organized and sponsored an outdoor track and field meet. In addition to sports, club members played billiards and card games and hosted social events to which women were also invited. Growth The club moved several times to various locations around Oakland as it grew. The club was incorporated in 1892 with a membership of 300, and by 1893, had 350 members and held a gala affair as it moved into a three-story building at the corner of San Pablo Avenue and 17th Street. The club remained in this facility into the first decade of the 20th century, but after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake was forced to relocate to accommodate San Francisco businesses that moved to Oakland when their buildings were destroyed. The new location was renovated in early 1907, but by the summer of 1907, the club had moved again near the Piedmont Baths. Demise and legacy By 1910, the club had moved several more times but was apparently facing financial difficulties; in August 1910, a contractor sued the members for $2,300 owed to him. With no money in the treasury, the club declared bankruptcy and dissolved the organization. The building at 17th and San Pablo in which the club was at its peak was converted to the Reliance Theater in 1916. The theater was later known as the American Theater and finally the Esquire Theater. The building was demolished in the 1950s to make way for a Mel's Drive-In.

It is also called Santa Croce delle Scalette', due to the presence of a double flight of stairs (Italian: scale) giving access from the street; or Buon Pastore, since in the 19th century the church and the annexed cloister were entrusted to the Sisters of the Good Shepherd of Angers. The church was built in 1619 thanks to the subsidies of the Duke of Bavaria and of Cardinal Antonio Barberini, the brother of Pope Urban VIII; the cloister dates back to 1615 and was founded by the carmelite Domenico di Ges√π e Maria \\"in order to take the indecent women away from sin\\" (Armellini). The interior of the church shows a single nave and has been altered in the 19th century with a quite neoclassical style. The high altar housed a painting portraying Jesus bearing the cross, now replaced with a Crucifix by Francesco Troppa; the same author also painted the Annunciation on the right altar. Another noteworthy work is Mary Magdalene by Ciccio da Napoli. The annexed cloister, enlarged in the 19th century by Virginio Vespignani, always maintained its function as a redemption or rehabilitation house; in 1950, when the nuns left the institute, the building became a detachment of the women's prison for misdemeanors. This use ended in 1979 and now the cloister houses the Casa Internazionale delle Donne.  Bibliography  * M. Armellini, Le chiese di Roma dal secolo IV al XIX, Rome 1891 * C.

Set in Nice, it tells the story of a police detective faced with a series of unexplained killings of apparently unconnected people by a mystery sniper. Plot Unmarried police detective Carella sees Jocelyne, a sexy old flame who is being trailed by an Englishman. Any thoughts of taking up with her again are put aside because he has to investigate the assassination by a single shot from a long-range 0.22 rifle of Forest, a prominent local businessman. The widow is no help but the man's stepdaughter Sandra mentions an associate Barroyer, who later that day is killed in exactly the same way. Sandra also finds her stepfather's secret diary, which among many trysts recorded a steamy night with Jocelyne. Next day, Carella asks Jocelyne round to his flat and she is shot dead on the steps outside. He has learned that both Forest and Barroyer smuggled money through an astrologer and drug dealer called Kleinberg, who is shot later that day. After four deaths in two days, Carella's boss is frantic. Though the police have linked the victims to money laundering, narcotics and prostitution, nothing adds up to a motive for murdering them. Sandra gives them a big clue, as she knows two men who were at university with the four victims, one is a TV presenter called Sabirnou and the other a theatre director called Palombo. Both are brought in for questioning and a picture emerges. With two women whose present married names are unknown, as students all were in the cast of a play together. Why this should lead to their deaths remains unknown until next day one of the two unknown women, H√©l√®ne, approaches the police. She reveals to Carella that the end of run party degenerated into a mass sex orgy and that when Juliette, the other unknown woman, refused to join in she was gang raped. It remains to find Juliette, which happens next day when her husband rings the police. Arriving to take her in for questioning, Carella is shot at by a long-range rifle and, returning fire, he wounds the sniper. When he rushes into the building, he finds his assailant was her English husband, who has been systematically tracking down and killing all those involved in her rape.

As with most of Seneca's plays, Thyestes is based upon an older Greek version with the same name by Euripides. Characters * Thyestes, Brother of Atreus, in exile * Atreus, King of Argos * Tantalus, son of Thyestes * Plisthenes (silent role), son of Thyestes *Tantali umbra (ghost of Tantalus), grandfather of Atreus & Thyestes * Furia (Rage, Fury), often interpreted as Megaera * satelles, attendant or guard of Atreus * nuntius, messenger * Chorus Plot Pelops, the son of Tantalus, had banished his sons for the murder of their half- brother, Chrysippus, with a curse upon them. Upon the death of Pelops, Atreus returned and took possession of his father‚Äôs throne. Thyestes, also, claimed the throne: he seduced his brother‚Äôs wife, A√´rope, and stole by her assistance the magical, gold-fleeced ram from Atreus‚Äô flocks, upon the possession of which the right to rule was said to rest. For this act he was banished by the king. But Atreus has long been meditating a more complete revenge upon his brother; and now in pretended friendship has recalled him from banishment, offering him a place beside himself upon the throne. =Act I= Tantalus is brought from the underworld by the Fury, and he is compelled to foster the wicked enmity between his grandsons, Atreus and Thyestes, the sons of Pelops. The Chorus invokes the presiding deities of the cities in Peloponnesus, that they will prevent and avert the wickedness and crimes that are now hatching in the Palace of Pelops, and chants of the impious crimes of Tantalus. =Act II= Atreus consults with his guard as to the best way of carrying out vengeance on his brother. The guard, however, will not listen, and advises him only to do what is right. But Atreus decides on an impious and horrible plan for executing his revenge. The Chorus reproves the ambition of rulers, and points out what a true king should be, and lastly sings in praise of a retired life. =Act III= Thyestes being recalled by his brother Atreus, via his sons, returns to his country, not however without distrust, and a mind foreshadowing disaster. His sons are tendered as hostages, so that he will return. Atreus has entrapped his brother, and applauds silently to himself. He goes forth to meet him pretending to forgive. The Chorus, apparently oblivious to the preceding act, praises the fraternal affection of Atreus which has put aside the hatred and differences between the brothers, in much the same way as the calm which follows a storm illustrates. =Act IV= A Messenger who was present, reports the cruel deed of Atreus, and how the three children were killed and then served up to Thyestes at the horrible feast. The Chorus, observing the going down of the Sun, becomes alarmed, fearing that the whole fabric of the universe should dissolve into fragments and lapse into eternal chaos. =Act V= Wicked Atreus gleefully congratulates himself on his cruel revenge, and reveals to his brother Thyestes the dreadful feast which he had eaten, and the serving up of the blood of his sons. Chorus An aspect of Thyestes that is not well understood is the existence of the Chorus, which, following Greek practice, appears after the first Act. This would explain why they are unaware of what happened with Tantalus and the Fury. Critics believe that this is due to the fact that Seneca expected the play to be acted out, which would explain the Chorus' ignorance throughout much of the play.Davis, P.J. \\"The Chorus In Seneca's Thyestes.\\" Classical Quarterly 39.2 (1989): 421-435. International Bibliography of Theatre & Dance with Full Text. Web. 21 Oct. 2015. The second chorus is unfamiliar with what happened in Act II because they were not present on stage at that time. This is why they were unaware of Atreus' true plans to trick Thyestes and feed him his own children. It was not until Act IV that they were told of Atreus' crimes by the messenger. Some critics think that the contrast between what the Chorus says and what actually happens is confusing to the audience, which is why the Chorus is the least understood aspect of Senecan dramas. Translations and influence In 1560 Jasper Heywood, then a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, published a verse translation, which was republished in 1581 as part of Seneca, his tenne tragedies, translated into Engly≈øh. Watson Bradshaw composed a prose English translation in 1902. In 1907, Frank Justus Miller published a verse translation which was included in the original Loeb Classical Library. A new Loeb edition of Seneca's tragedies by John G. Fitch was published in 2002. Shakespeare's tragedy Titus Andronicus derives some of its plot elements from the story of Thyestes. In 1681, John Crowne wrote Thyestes, A Tragedy, based closely on Seneca's Thyestes, but with the incongruous addition of a love story. Prosper Jolyot Crebillon (1674-1762) wrote a tragedy \\"Atree et Thyeste\\" (1707), which is prominent in two tales of ratiocination by Edgar Allan Poe. In 1796, Ugo Foscolo (1778‚Äì1827) wrote a tragedy called Tieste that was represented first in Venice one year later. Caryl Churchill, a British dramatist, also wrote a rendition of Thyestes. Caryl's specific translation was performed at the Royal Court Theater Upstairs in London on June 7, 1994Seneca; Churchill, Caryl. Thyestes. : Nick Hern Books, 2014. Ebook Library. Web. 21 Oct. 2015. In 2004, Jan van Vlijmen (1935‚Äì2004) completed his opera Thyeste. The libretto was a text in French by Hugo Claus, based on his 20th century play with the same title (in Dutch: Thyestes). Thyestes appears in Ford Ainsworth's one-act play, Persephone. References Further reading * Otto Zwierlein (ed.), Seneca Tragoedia (Oxford: Clarendon Press: Oxford Classical Texts: 1986) * John G.

The First Model, produced between 1837 and 1838, was the first firearm manufactured by Samuel Colt, developed shortly before the advent of the Colt Paterson revolver. The First Model was succeeded by the Second Model, produced between 1838 and 1841, which featured minor variations in design and construction. Both models are distinguished from later Colt revolving long-arms by the presence of a small ring lever located in front of the trigger. This lever, when pulled, would index the cylinder to the next position and cock the internal hidden hammer. Although complicated in design and prone to failures, fifty First Model rifles were ordered by the U.S. Army for use against Seminole warriors in the Second Seminole War. Overview =First Model= The First Model Ring Lever rifle features a octagonal barrel with a browned finish. The finishes of the other metal parts are blued. The rifle features a circular trigger guard, which lies behind the ring lever. The ring-shaped lever is used by the operator to both cock the internal hammer and rotate the cylinder (as opposed to cocking an external hammer on later single-action revolvers). The First Model was offered in .34, .36, .38, .40, and .44 calibers with an eight-shot revolving cylinder, though ten-shot examples were produced in very limited numbers. The cylinder features a roll engraving depicting a deer hunted by a centaur and a group of horsemen. The front and rear edges of the cylinder were originally square, though later improvements yielded a rounded rear cylinder edge. These improvements also included the addition of a cutout in the recoil shield to enable capping the nipples without disassembly and the addition of a loading lever.Flayderman 2007, pp. 81-82. The rifle features a walnut stock with crescent buttplate and a raised cheekpiece featuring an inlaid image of four horse-heads. The First Model is distinguished by the presence of a top strap located over the cylinder, a feature absent from nearly all successive Colt revolvers until the development of the Colt Single Action Army in 1873. =Second Model= Colt Paterson Ring Lever rifle Although the Second Model Ring Lever rifle is identical in operation to the First Model, minor differences in appearance are apparent. Most notably, the Second Model lacks the top strap included on the First Model, opting instead for an open top design. The Second Model also lacks the inlaid image on the cheekpiece, but includes an image of a house in the roll cylinder engraving not present in the First Model. In similar fashion to the First Model, improvements were made to the Second Model during production to include the addition of a loading lever, the rounding of the rear cylinder edge, and the addition of a capping notch in the recoil shield. The Second Model was only offered in .44 caliber, but was offered in both and barrel lengths (though the 28 inch barrel was less common). As with the First Model, eight-shot cylinders were standard; only a small number of ten-shot cylinders were manufactured. Production Production of the First Model Ring Lever rifle began in 1837 in the Patent Arms Manufacturing Company's factory in Paterson, New Jersey. The First Model Ring Lever rifle was Samuel Colt's first manufactured firearm, and was followed shortly thereafter in late 1837 by the introduction of the Colt Paterson pistol. The First Model remained in production until 1838, with a total of about 200 firearms manufactured (serial numbers 1 through 200). In 1838, the Second Model Ring Lever rifle began production and continued until 1841, with a total of about 500 manufactured (serial numbers 1 through 500). Because only a small number of the Ring Lever rifles were manufactured, they are considered rare finds among all Colt firearms, with the First Model being the rarest firearm produced under the Patent Arms Manufacturing Company. Reception and use William S. Harney, a proponent of Colt's Ring Lever rifles Although neither the First nor Second Model Ring Lever rifles saw widespread adoption by any military organization, several were procured by the United States Army and the Texas Navy. After an unfavorable review by Army officials in September 1837, which reported that Colt's First Model Ring Lever rifle was prone to failure and too complicated for combat service, a second review was conducted in March 1838. At the request of Lieutenant Colonel William S. Harney of the Second Dragoon Regiment, Colt traveled to Florida with 100 Ring Lever rifles for the review. During the trial, officers of the second dragoons reported favorably on Colt's rifles after they conducted several experiments that demonstrated that the First Model Ring Lever rifle was equal or superior to conventional arms in accuracy, penetration, rapidity of fire, resistance to weather, and safety. The experiments found that the Ring Lever rifle could fire off sixteen shots in thirty-one seconds, with the ability to load and fire an eight-shot cylinder in forty-eight seconds. This board of officers advocated equipping select trained men in each company with Colt's rifle, fearing universal employment may cause damage to the guns because of their delicate construction. As the board was conducting its experiments, several friendly Indians had gathered to watch and described Colt's rifle as \\"great medicine.\\" With the success of the tests, Army Bvt. Major General Thomas Jesup agreed to outfit a section of the second dragoons with fifty First Model rifles for use during the Second Seminole War. The purchase gave Colt a total of $6,250, or $125 per rifle. The availability of multiple shots offered by Colt's rifle was seen as an advantage against the Seminole warriors, who had learned the vulnerability of troops who had already fired the conventional single-shot military arms of the day. Reports of use in combat illustrated the delicate and complicated construction of the rifles, which easily put them out of service. Although the guns were not perfect and prone to defect, the use of the new weapons against the Seminoles yielded significant gains. In 1839, nearly a year after acquiring fifty First Model rifles, Colonel Harney remarked that all but two were in good working order. Later in July 1839, however, a surprise Seminole attack led to the loss of thirty Ring Lever rifles, though fourteen were eventually recovered. In spite of the rifle's reliability problems, support for Colt's rifles was garnered from field officers, especially from Lieutenant Colonel Harney. Harney commented on Colt's Ring Lever rifle favorably, stating: \\"I honestly believe that, but for these arms, the Indians would now be luxuriating in the Everglades of Florida.\\" Colt capitalized on Harney's testimony to produce a report featuring the endorsement and various statistics about the Ring Lever rifles. Endorsements for Colt's Ring Lever rifles came from other sources as well, including First Sergeant P. W. Henry of Harney's second dragoons who drilled soldiers in the use of the revolving rifles. Henry claimed that when \\"passing through Indian country, I always felt myself safer with one of your rifles in my hands, than if I was attended by a body of ten or fifteen men armed with the common musket or carbine.\\" In spite of the personal endorsements Colt gathered, he received no more contracts for Ring Lever rifles from the U.S. Army. In 1839, however, after difficulty in selling arms to state governments, 100 Ring Lever rifles were ordered by the Texas Navy. Aside from military use, Florida presented another market for Colt's Ring Lever rifles in 1840. In a letter from Charles Downing, Delegate to Congress from the Florida Territory, to Waddy Thompson, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Military Affairs, Downing requested the procurement of 500 Colt Ring Lever rifles for distribution to frontier settlers in Florida. Downing recognized the advantage of Colt's ten-shot rifles, and desired to arm settlers with these rifles in order that they may effectively defend themselves and their families against attacks by the Seminoles. In his letter, Downing states that \\"no man in Florida is safe in his own house\\" and that military protection by the U.S. Army was ineffective. In Downing's opinion, Colt's Ring Lever rifles were the solution, as they were \\"superior to twenty ordinary rifles\\" (with an extra ten-shot cylinder) and \\"superior to ten men\\" armed with conventional weapons. The price given for the 500 rifles was between $40 to $45 each, or a total of around $20,000. It is clear that Downing refers to Colt's Ring Lever rifles, as these were Colt's only models featuring ten-shot cylinders, and it is most likely that these rifles would be Second Model rifles as the letter's 1840 date was within the production range of the Second Model and Downing refers to the rifles as \\"improved\\".Flayderman 2007, pp. 82-83. Although such a transaction would represent significant business for Colt, it appears that the House of Representatives took no action on this proposal, as documents do not mention a purchase of this magnitude by the U.S. Government. Although government sales were poor with Colt's Ring Lever rifles, Colt had more success with his Model 1839 Carbine. This model, produced from 1838 to 1841, lacked a ring lever and featured a more familiar external hammer. Approximately 950 Model 1839 Carbines were manufactured, of which 180 were purchased by the Texas Navy and 360 were purchased by the United States Navy. Still, sales were weaker than expected, leading to the closing of the Patent Arms Manufacturing Company in 1842. Samuel Colt would not produce firearms again until collaboration with Samuel Walker resulted in production of the Colt Walker revolver around 1847.

He was also a writer, philosopher, journalist, publisher, historian, diplomat and the founder of modern Serbian journalism and publishing. Early life Dimitrije Davidoviƒá, born in Zemun on 12 October 1789, was the son of Gavrilo and Marija Georgijeviƒá. In 1789 his father, a regiment priest of the Serbian Orthodox Church in the Austrian Army, was transferred to Zemun after the liberation of Belgrade from the Turks. His grandfather, Very Rev. David Georgijeviƒá, was a professor at the famed Latin School (Latinska ≈°kola) at Sremski Karlovci, founded by Metropolitan Pavle Nenadoviƒá of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Dimitrije was a sickly child and as such was inclined to read and write instead of playing outdoors. He completed Serbian grammar school in Zemun and the Protestant lyceum of Ke≈æmarok, and his post-secondary education, at Sremski Karlovci, was guided by his professor of Latin, his paternal grandfather Georgijeviƒá. From there he then went to the universities of Pest and Vienna, where he first studied philosophy then switched over to the University of Vienna's prestigious School of Medicine. He was early involved in the political troubles in which Serbia and the Serbian people were then immersed with the Turkish authorities in Istanbul (Constantinople). Dimitrije decided one day to take his grandfather's given name \\"David\\" as his surname \\"Davidoviƒá\\" to avoid detection by the authorities who were looking for him at the time. The First Serbian Uprising, led by Karaƒëorƒëe Petroviƒá, started in 1804 but could not survive beyond 1813 without the support of the Great Powers. Soon, came the Second Serbian Uprising under Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá I, Prince of Serbia in 1815 which gained nominal concessions from the sultan of Constantinople, thanks to the intervention of Imperial Russia.

While studying medicine in Vienna in 1812, Dimitrije Davidoviƒá wanted to start a Serbian newspaper but could not get a license which was personally denied by Klemens von Metternich himself. About 1813, in conjunction with a fellow student, Dimitrije Fru≈°iƒá, he founded and edited a Serbian newspaper in Vienna called Novine serbske iz carstvuju≈°ƒçeg grada Viene (Serbian news from the Imperial City of Vienna), and Zabavnik (Entertainment), in which many interesting particulars respecting the literature and political history of Serbia was published. Like Stefan von Novakoviƒá, his predecessor, Davidoviƒá believed that any people who would like to be recognized as enlightened must have its national newspapers and magazines, which are essentially important for the four million Serbs living under the Habsburg yoke at the time. His Novine serbske iz carstvajuscega grada Viene (Serbian news from the Imperial City of Vienna)soon changed its direction from translations of travelogues, biographies, and writings on history to national issues (current events) and Serbian literature. Among the contributors in his newspaper and magazine were Lukijan Mu≈°icki, Sima Milutinoviƒá Sarajlija, Teodor Pavloviƒá, Georgije Magara≈°eviƒá, Danilo Medakoviƒá and other prominent Serbian poets and writers. Both the newspaper and almanach were eventually suppressed by the Austrian government in 1821. He wrote Istorija Serbije (History of Serbia), 1813-1815 and what is now considered his best work, Srbijanka (Serbian Woman, 1826), an epic poem in praise of the liberation of Serbia, led by Karaƒëorƒëe Petroviƒá (1804) and Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá (1813). Serbian historiography at the revolutionary time of pre-romanticism, it is said, has no better representative than Simeon Pi≈°ƒçeviƒá, right up to Dimitrije Davidoviƒá. His \\"History of the Serbian People\\", was published for the first time in Vienna in 1821, and supplemented by lawyer Jovan Had≈æiƒá, was reprinted in 1846 by Gligorije Vozaroviƒá.Velimir Gaj, Knji≈ænica Gajeva: Ogled bibliografijskih studija spisao i na sviet, Tiask Narodne tiskare Gajeve, 1875, p. 46.

Secretary to Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá of Serbia His talents gained him the favourable notice of Prince Milo≈° (Obrenoviƒá) of Serbia, who appointed Davidoviƒá secretary of his offices at Belgrade, and sent him on special diplomatic missions. According to prince Milo≈°'s judgement Davidoviƒá was \\"exceptionally talented in diplomacy.\\" He resided in Belgrade and enjoyed the continued favour of the court. He headed the Serbian diplomatic delegation in Istanbul (Constantinople), Turkey, from 1829 to 1833. He is considered by Serbian historians as one of the most important diplomats of his era. In one of Davidoviƒá's patriotic appeals on 3 August 1821 he pointed out the need for female children's education. Since the state was technically at war with the Turks and almost unable to concern itself with the opening of a girls' school which at the time was prohibited by Moslem (Turkish) law. He was Minister of Education and Minister for Foreign Affairs from 8 June 1834 to 2 December 1835. Candlemas Constitution In 1835 he was placed at the head of a committee to draw up a Serbian constitution; and it was, after all, chiefly drawn up by himself. Called \\"Sretenje Ustav\\" (Candlemas Constitution) it was drafted by Dimitrije Davidoviƒá to secure Serbia protection of citizens before the state and transformation of Serbia into a legal state with protected human and property rights for all. It was the first step toward power-sharing in modern Serb political history. But it was not to be expected that such sweeping changes could be affected without opposition, and no sooner the Sublime Porte and Austria brought their grievances against the implemented Sretenje. Prince Milo≈° yielded to them, but many of Davidoviƒá's followers were not so complaisant, and it was only by threat of force of arms that the new constitution was abolished after being less than three weeks in force. Davidoviƒá and Prince Milo≈° sadly parted company under political pressure. Davidoviƒá withdrew from Belgrade to Smederevo, where he died three years later. Legacy Dimitrije Davidoviƒá greatly distinguished himself as one of the most intrepid and influential supporters of the cause of liberalism, in both political and religious matters, until his death at Smederevo, where he died on 24 March 1838. He belongs principally to the same class of writers as Djordje Magara≈°eviƒá, Teodor Pavloviƒá, and Danilo Medakoviƒá who worked tirelessly more on a cultural and political plain than literary. =House of Dimitrije Davidoviƒá= The House of Dimitrije Davidoviƒá is located in Belgrade, in Zemun, at the corner of the Zemun Main Street and Davidoviƒá Street. It is part of the Cultural Monuments of Exceptional Importance and is protected by Serbia. The complex was developed from the mid-18th to mid-19th century, and includes an inner courtyard. The house is a typical one-story residential house with two tracts, six windows, with long fronts on both sides of the street. The uniform facades comprise all the development phases of the building and contribute to an integral spatial impression. House represents a more modest variation of the classic townhouse, with harmonic proportions, simplicity, and coherence in the treatment of its facades.

A journalism major at the University of Southern California, he went on to become well known on network radio and television.  Early years  Joy's involvement with radio at the local level began when, while a student at USC, he worked part-time for radio stations in Los Angeles, California. His first job after graduation was at KEHE, and he later joined the announcing staff of KNX.  Radio career  At age 21, Joy moved up from the local level to CBS, becoming that network's youngest staff announcer in history. By 1937, he was involved with Kathryn Cravens' News Through a Woman's Eye, Good Afternoon Neighbors, Thomas Conrad Sawyer Series Goodyear Sun-up News, and The Newlyweds. In the following three years, he added to his achievements work on My Secret Ambition, Hollywood in Person, Road of Life, I Want a Divorce, College of Musical Knowledge, Burns and Allen, and The Beauty Explorer. Joy went on to be the announcer for numerous network radio programs including The Adventures of Bill Lance, The Danny Kaye Show, Forever Ernest, The Sad Sack, Vox Pop,Buxton, Frank and Owen, Bill (1972).

McBain have opened their new station, KCMJ, at Palm Springs.\\" Thus, Joy began his first venture into ownership of a station while continuing to work on network radio. His entry in the \\"Announcers\\" section of the 1947 Radio Annual listed 10 network entertainment programs in addition to newscasts. He sold KCMJ in 1950.  Television career  Like many artists from radio, Joy moved to television as that medium grew in popularity. TV programs for which he was the announcer included December Bride, Perry Mason, Have Gun - Will Travel, Daktari, Lost in Space, Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C., Playhouse 90. and Sheriff of Cochise. Radio/television columnist Glen Stadler reported that Joy eventually left television to return to radio \\"because he refused to act like the advertiser demanded ... using the shove-em-at-you technique.\\" Joy told Stadler, \\"I don't want any more [until] the advertiser ... admits that the buyer has intelligence.\\" Returning to local radio in 1951, Joy became news director at KFAC in Los Angeles. Billboard magazine reported that, in addition to being news director, Joy would \\"handle all morning newscasts and some early afternoon shows.\\" Joy also worked at two Los Angeles television stations, KTTV and KNXT. He retired in 1969. Family Joy had a wife, Cecelia, two daughters, and three grandchildren.

Swapping between an I√±upiaq girl named Nuna and her Arctic fox companion, the player completes puzzles in a story that spans eight chapters. The game was the result of a partnership between the Cook Inlet Tribal Council and E-Line Media. It is one of a growing number of video games produced by Indigenous people.  Gameplay  The player-character plays as the I√±upiaq girl Nuna and her Arctic fox. As an \\"atmospheric puzzle platformer\\", Never Alone puzzles entail swapping control between Nuna and the fox. While the fox is fast, Nuna can pick up things and open new areas using her bola. The story and its structure is based on the intergenerational transference of wisdom. Told in the form of an oral tale, unlike traditional platformer games, which involve overcoming obstacles and defeating enemies, Never Alone rewards players with collectible \\"cultural insights\\" - video vignettes of I√±upiaq elders, storytellers, and community members sharing their stories. The central plot revolves around discovering the source of the blizzard that has ravaged Nuna's village and restoring balance to nature. Other stories include that of Blizzard Man, the Little People, Manslayer, the Rolling Heads, and the Sky People. It takes place in a harsh physical environment.  Development  Never Alone was developed by Upper One Games in conjunction with writer Ishmael Hope, a storyteller and poet of I√±upiaq and Tlingit heritage,http://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/nitv- news/article/2017/04/20/video-games-encourage-indigenous-cultural- expressionhttps://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/ishmael-hope-alaska- native-art-amp-culture-educator/ and the Cook Inlet Tribal Council, a non- profit organization that works with indigenous groups living in Alaska's urban areas. The Council partnered with video game education company E-Line Media and generated the idea for Never Alone as part of a series that \\"shares, celebrates, and extends [indigenous] culture\\". The Council's for-profit Upper One Games is the \\"first indigenous-owned video game developer and publisher in US history\\". They built the game to explore \\"what it means to be human\\" and intergenerational stories. It is intended both to share the stories of native culture as entertainment, and to revitalize interest in Alaskan indigenous folklore. Proceeds from the game will fund the Council's education mission. E-Line Creative Director Sean Vesce was excited by the opportunity to \\"go into a community, learn more about a culture and then try to infuse their values and mythologies into a game\\". Vesce and his team made \\"a dozen trips to Alaska\\" to meet with community members and gather stories and imagery and was \\"blown away at the richness and beauty and depth of that storytelling tradition\\". He realized that \\"none of that had really been ever explored in a videogame\\". Vesce previously held leadership positions at Crystal Dynamics and Activision. Vesce built and led a 12-member development team in Seattle, who worked in deep partnership with \\"40 Alaska Native elders, storytellers and community members\\" to craft the game. Never Alone was built in the Unity game engine. A local-cooperative mode is available.  Reception  Never Alone received many accolades including the British Academy Award for Best Debut game and Game of the Year and Most Significant Impact awards from the Games for Change organization. In 2015, Never Alone was also nominated for Outstanding Achievement in Game Direction from D.I.C.E., Best Debut from Game Developers Choice Awards, Matthew Crump Cultural Innovation Award from SXSW Gaming Awards. In 2014, Never Alone was an Official Selection Finalist at Indiecade. Never Alone received \\"mixed\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Critics positively noted the game's art design, which blends a simple, cartoon style with scrimshaw influences. The included documentary videos were also remarked upon as \\"[leaving the player] feeling educated as well as entertained\\" and \\"[doing] an excellent job of giving a cultural context\\" for the game. The platforming elements of Never Alone were more divisive. Some reviewers described the game as \\"frustrating\\", noting imprecise controls and inconsistent behavior by in-game characters. However, other critics felt the gameplay was diverse and \\"satisfying\\". Never Alone: Foxtales The first expansion for the game, titled Never Alone: Foxtales, was announced on July 16, 2015. Adding new levels and expanding upon the story, the expansion was released worldwide on July 28, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

The player can use a voice control system to direct their units around the battlefield to ensure a tactical advantage over the enemy. The game features voice actors Wil Wheaton, Ashly Burch, Yuri Lowenthal, Laura Bailey and Cassandra Morris. The game was crowdfunded via Kickstarter for $115,570 (USD) by 3,906 backers, the requested budget was $90,000.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iridiumstudios/there-came-an- echo-0/ The game received further investment from Intel to implement Intel's RealSense technology. Reception Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 4 out of 5, saying \\"Iridium Studios has demonstrated how to properly create something fresh and exciting that encapsulates everything that the indie scene is capable of. Sure, its story can get a bit incoherent, its non-voice controls are awkward, and there are moments of spotty voice-recognition, but the good greatly outweighs what little bad there is.\\" Development The developer has shown interest in bringing the game to Linux and SteamOS provided there is sufficient community support to do so. It was also mentioned that the main blocker is the proprietary voice libraries currently used by the game that do not support those platforms, so another library would need to be found that would suit the functional needs of the game.
