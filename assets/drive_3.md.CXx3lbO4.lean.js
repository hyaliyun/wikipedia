They are located between Riverside Avenue and the Acushnet River, north of Manoment Street and the Whitman Mills. The complex consists of three Classical Revival brick buildings, built between 1903 and 1907. The main building, Mill No. 1, is a 54-bay three story structure that was built in 1903. It is attached to Mill No. 2 (1907), of similar size, by a single story brick structure. The third building is the Mill No. 2 Department Room (1907), a two-story brick building that was originally connected to the other two via overhead bridges, now removed. The mill complex was the main operating site of the Manoment Mill Company, which produced cotton yarn until about 1928. The buildings were sold in that year to the Delaware Rayon Company, which went bankrupt in 1954. Mill No. 2 was then used by the Acushnet Process Company for the manufacture of golf balls, while Mill No. 1 continued to be used for rayon production, a chemically intensive and environmentally hazardous process.

He first appeared in Blazing Comics (1944), and was created by Chinese-American cartoonist Chu F. Hing. Character history The Green Turtle aided the Chinese in guerrilla warfare against the Japanese invaders in World War II. He wore a green cowl and a cloak with a turtle-shell design. Most origin stories around the comic say that Hing initially wanted to make him an overtly Chinese hero, but his publisher would not allow this, believing there would not be a sufficient market for an Asian superhero, so Hing never drew the character without his mask. He had a sidekick, Burma Boy, a young beggar whom the Green Turtle rescued from execution by the Japanese army. He also had a manservant, Wun Too. The Green Turtle's secret identity was never revealed, and readers never saw the character's face without a mask. Powers and abilities The Green Turtle as originally written has no special powers but is a skilled fighter and flies a high-tech Turtle Plane. He wears a large, flowing cape with a green turtle emblem, and is occasionally depicted with a huge, shadowy, black turtle silhouette rearing behind him, though the significance of this is never established in the original series. Reboot In 2014, Gene Luen Yang and Sonny Liew created a six-issue miniseries The Shadow Hero to revive the Green Turtle, with a retcon explaining the turtle silhouette as a spirit who keeps the Green Turtle from getting shot.

Early years l'Astrolabe, Verninac's first command The Verninac family originated in Gourdon, Lot in the former province of Quercy. Jean de Verninac was a counsellor of the king in Villefranche in 1696. Another family member was vicar-general of Rodez in 1786. His nephew was the diplomat Raymond de Verninac Saint-Maur. Raymond-Jean-Baptiste de Verninac Saint-Maur was the son of Fran√ßois de Verninac (1753‚Äì1837) and Marie Delphy de Lisle of Salignac in P√©rigord. His father was brother of the diplomat Raymond de Verninac, He was born in Souillac on 11 June 1794. He entered the navy as a midshipman in 1812. He advanced slowly during the peace that followed the end of the Napoleonic Wars. He was promoted to sublieutenant in 1819 and lieutenant in 1824. Naval commands In 1829 Verninac took command of the corvette L'Astrolabe, with which Jules Dumont d'Urville had made his first voyage around the world. He went to Alexandria to pick up the mission led by Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion, which had completed three years of exploration and studies in the Nile Valley. He took them back to Toulon, and made friends with Champollion on the voyage. He then participated in the Invasion of Algiers in 1830. He was promoted to Lieutenant Commander (Capitaine de corvette) in 1833. corvette Sphinx tows the barge Luxor carrying the Luxor Obelisk to France Muhammad Ali, effective ruler of Egypt, made a gift to France of an obelisk at Luxor weighing 230 tons, which had to be transported from Luxor back to France. Verninac was given command of the expedition on Champollion's recommendation. With the help of the naval engineer Apollinaire Lebas, Verninac developed the idea of cutting a flat-bottomed barge in half across its center, installing the obelisk, then rebuilding the barge so it could be towed down the Nile and on to France. The steam corvette Le Sphinx, a three- masted schooner that was the first steam vessel of the French Navy, was used to tow the specially built Le Luxor barge, which carried the obelisk from Thebes to Paris. Verninac published an account of the voyage in 1834, Le voyage du Luxor en √âgypte. The obelisk remained on the quay of the Seine for two years before being erected in the Place de la Concorde on 25 October 1836. Verninac was promoted to Commander. In 1838 he was made director of the steam packet boats carrying mail in the Mediterranean. He was promoted to Captain in 1842. Verninac was appointed a member of a commission to organize and arm steam boats. He was one of the first captains to enter the Admiralty council in 1848. He was always interested in new ideas, and was quick to recognize the revolutionary impact of steam on naval warfare. Political career Verninac was appointed under-secretary of state for the Navy and Colonies on 6 June 1848, and Minister of the Navy and Colonies from 17 July to 20 December 1848 in the cabinet headed by General Louis-Eug√®ne Cavaignac. He became a deputy for Lot in July 1848. Severe cuts to the naval budget prevented Verninac from implementing his ideas for reform of the navy and construction of modern vessels. He was named Rear Admiral on 16 December 1848. He left office fours days later when Louis Napoleon Bonaparte was announced winner of the presidential elections. Verminac chose to remain faithful to Cavaignac. Later years On 8 July 1849 Verninac was elected representative for Lot in the Legislative Assembly. He was general councillor for Lot from 1848 to 1852. Verninac did not sit in the Assembly after the coup d'√©tat of 2 December 1851. Bonaparte named him governor of R√©union, then of the French establishments in India. He retired from active service in June 1856, and returned to France in 1957. On 30 December 1864 he was made Commander of the Legion of Honour. Verninac died at Souillac on 11 February 1873 at the age of 78. The Admiral's son Louis-Raymond de Verninac de Saint-Maur became a Commander in the navy. His son Charles de Verninac was elected Senator for Lot in 1883. A bust of Verninac was installed in Souillac in 1898, but was removed by German occupying forces in 1942. A replacement bust by the sculptor Pascal Peltier was erected on 30 June 2007.

It is the sequel to the 1975 film Criminally Insane. This sequel was shot on video and is 50% clips from its predecessor (presented as flashbacks). The film contains roughly just 30 minutes of new content. The new content has no soundtrack (the only music in the film is during the reused flashback footage), and the video quality is markedly poor, a constant whirring of the machinery being audible.  Plot  Due to budget cuts, an asylum for the criminally insane releases the infamous Ethel Janowski, a morbidly obese woman whose obsession with food caused her to murder six people 13 years earlier, into a halfway house operated by the elderly Hope Bartholomew. As soon as Ethel is admitted into the Bartholomew House, it becomes clear that she's still delusional, convinced that Hope is her dead grandmother, and that a fellow patient named Edgar Stanley is the detective who arrested her. As time passes, Ethel begins demanding more food and refusing to take her medication. One day, while Hope is out, an orderly feeds the residents dog food, and taunts Ethel by slowly eating a chocolate bar in front of her. Ethel snaps, and kills the orderly by hanging him with a cord, an act witnessed by Edgar. A lieutenant is called in to investigate the death, and leaves after questioning Ethel. Edgar tells Ethel that he will keep quiet about what she did, in exchange for her desserts. Ethel tries to poison Edgar, and when that fails, she resorts to stabbing him with four knives. After another visit from the lieutenant, Hope catches Ethel eating a bag of pretzels, and tries to confiscate them, prompting Ethel to bash her head in. Ethel proceeds to murder the remaining resident (a man who believed he was an insect) and one of the institution doctors when he drops by to see why his calls to the halfway house have not been getting through. Ethel then dances with a dog and a knife in the house's backyard, and when the lieutenant returns she answers the door, and laughs crazily as she states, \\"Welcome to Bartholomew House. I'm Hope Bartholomew, and I hope you'll be very happy here!\\"  Cast  * Priscilla Alden as Ethel Janowsky * Joe Elliot as Dinner Server * Albert Eskinazi as Edgar Stanley * Royal Farros as Doctor * Frances Millard as Hope Bartholomew * Nick Millard as Doctor Stevens * Fred Sarra as Lieutenant Frank Harris  Reception  Bill Gibron of DVD Talk awarded the film a score of 2/5, and wrote, \\"While there is some enjoyment to be had in revisiting a favorite fiend, Criminally Insane 2 is nothing more than a novelty.

After winning his only race as a novice he won two handicaps and the Grade II Relkeel Hurdle before taking the Grade I World Hurdle at the 2014 Cheltenham Festival. Background More Of That is a bay gelding with a white star bred in Ireland by the County Wicklow-based Eleanor Hadden. He was sired by Beneficial (1990-2013), a British horse who won the Dee Stakes and the King Edward VII Stakes in 1993 and the Scottish Classic in the following year before becoming a successful National Hunt stallion. Apart from More of That, his best winners include Realt Dubh (Powers Gold Cup), Benefficient (Paddy Power Dial-A-Bet Chase) and Cooldine (RSA Chase). His dam, Guigone is a French-bred mare who has produced several other winners. In November 2008, More Of That was sent as a foal to the Tattersalls Ireland National Hunt sale where he was bought for ‚Ç¨28,000 by the bloodstock agent John O'Byrne on behalf of J. P. McManus. The horse was sent into training with Jonjo O'Neill at Jackdaw Castle in Gloucestershire. Racing career =2012/2013 National Hunt season: Novice hurdles= More Of That made his racecourse debut in a maiden hurdle race at Folkestone Racecourse on 4 December 2012. Ridden by Richie McLernon he started a 20/1 outsider in a seven-runner field. He took the lead at the last hurdle despite a jumping error and won \\"very easily\\" by two and three quarter lengths from the 8/11 favourite Utopian, with a gap of twenty-two lengths back to the third-placed horse. =2013/2014 National Hunt season= More of That wins at Haydock Park in November 2013. After a break of eleven months, More Of That returned in a two and a half mile handicap hurdle at Wetherby on 2 November 2013, in which he started 3/1 favourite despite carrying top weight of 165 pounds. Ridden by A. P. McCoy, he jumped the last hurdle in second place before staying on to take the lead in the closing stages and won by a length from Twelve Roses. Three weeks later, with McCoy again in the saddle, the gelding was carried 156 pounds in a more valuable handicap at Haydock Park Racecourse. He looked outpaced in the straight and was in sixth place jumping the last, but produced a strong finish to win by two lengths from the Barry Geraghty-ridden Blue Fashion. On 14 December, More of That was moved up in class for the Grade II Relkeel Hurdle over two and a half miles at Cheltenham Racecourse and started 11/4 second favorite in a field which included the Grade I-winning Irish mare Glens Melody and the French champion Gemix, winner of the Grande Course de Haies d'Auteuil. McCoy made his challenge at the last hurdle and More of That took the lead on the run-in to win by two and a quarter lengths from the Paul Nicholls-trained Salubrious. At Cheltenham on 13 March, More Of That started at odds of 15/2 for the Grade I World Hurdle over a distance of three miles. He was ridden by Geraghty as McCoy had opted to ride the other McManus runner At Fishers Cross. The betting was headed by the mare Annie Power, unbeaten at that time in ten races and Big Buck's who had won the race on four previous occasions, while the other contenders included the Grade I winners Zarkandar, Celestial Halo and Reve de Siola. Geraghty held the gelding up in the early stages before moving up to dispute the lead approaching the final hurdle. More Of That got the better of Annie Power on the run-in and won by one and a half lengths, with At Fishers Cross five lengths back in third. After the race Geraghty said: \\"He still is a little bit innocent but he's got an engine. I always felt I had the finish\\". Jonjo O'Neill commented \\"We were very pleased with the horse and he was in great old form. Jumping the last, I thought he would keep galloping. I had a little doubt in my mind that Annie Power might not quite get home but she gave us a fair fright\\". =2014/2015 National Hunt season= On his first and only appearance in the 2014/2015 season, More Of That started the 4/7 favourite against five opponents in the Long Distance Hurdle at Newbury Racecourse. After tracking the leaders for most of the way, he began to struggle approaching the final hurdle and faded in the closing stages, sustaining his first defeat as he finished third behind Medinas and Cole Harden. The gelding underwent an operation to correct breathing problems but bled after an exercise gallop in February and was subsequently ruled out for the rest of the season. =2015/2016 National Hunt season= Almost a year later on 13 November 2015, More Of That debuted in his first Chase race of class 2 against a field of 6 other novice chasers. He traveled and jumped well midpack and made his move in the home straight to win easily by 2¬Ω lengths. He had one further outing before the Cheltenham festival and that was Raymond Mould Memorial Novices' Chase on 12 December in which he was again victorious. In the 2016 RSA Chase at the Cheltenham Festival he came third to Blaklion despite having burst a blood vessel.http://www.skysports.com/racing/race- report/10207208/rsa-chase =2016/2017 National Hunt season= In the following season More Of That was campaigned against more experienced steeplechasers and began his season in the BetVictor Gold Cup on 12 November when he was pulled-up on the run-in. He produced an improved effort on 4 December, finishing third to Josses Hill and Tea For Two in the Peterborough Chase. In his next two races he contested Grade I chases in Ireland, finishing sixth in the Lexus Chase and then unseating his rider in the Irish Gold Cup. On 17 March 2017 More Of That made his third appearance at the Cheltenham Festival when he started at odds of 14/1 for the Cheltenham Gold Cup. He never looked likely to win but stayed on in the closing stages and came home sixth of the ten finishers behind Sizing John.

Life Mary was born in Manchester in 1804 to Thomas Huddart, a chemist from Dublin, and his wife, Ann n√©e Gough of Limerick. Her father had acted at the Crow Street Theatre in Dublin. After playing at Greenwich for her father's benefit, Mary Huddart became at the reputed age of fifteen a member of Brunton's company at Plymouth, Exeter, Bristol, and Birmingham. In 1829 she was acting in Dublin. On the London stage On 22 November 1830, as Miss Huddart from Dublin, she appeared at Drury Lane Theatre, playing Belvidera in Venice Preserved to the Pierre of William Macready, to whose recommendation she owed her engagement by the managers Polhill and Lee. She had previously been seen in London at the Surrey and Tottenham Street theatres.Among the parts played in her first season were Emma in James Sheridan Knowles's William Tell, Alicia in Jane Shore by Nicholas Rowe, and Constance in King John. She was also the original Queen Elswith in Knowles's Alfred the Great. She then returned to Dublin, and played leading business under Calcraft. In 1836, under Alfred Bunn's management, Mary Huddart was again at Drury Lane, where she supported Edwin Forrest as Lady Macbeth, Emilia, and other characters, and was the original Marian in Sheridan Knowles's The Wrecker's Daughter: her success in it led to her engagement at the Haymarket for the first production in London of The Bridal, an adaptation by Knowles of The Maid's Tragedy. In this she played on 26 June 1837 Evadne, opposite Macready as Melantius. She also played Portia to Samuel Phelps's Shylock, and Helen McGregor to his Rob Roy. At about this period she married. In the autumn of 1837 Mrs. Warner joined Macready at Covent Garden Theatre, where she stayed two years, supporting him in many Shakespearean parts and building a reputation. She was the original Joan of Arc in Thomas James Serle's play of the name. She had been prevented by illness from playing at Covent Garden the heroine of Thomas Noon Talfourd's Athenian Captive, but took the part at the Haymarket on 4 August 1838. Mrs. Warner accompanied Macready to Drury Lane, and was on 29 April 1842 the Queen in Hamlet, and on 10 December the original Lady Lydia Lynterne in Westland Marston's Patrician's Daughter. In 1843 she acted with Samuel Phelps in Bath, and on 27 May 1844, with him and T. L. Greenwood, began the management of Sadler's Wells, opening as Lady Macbeth, and speaking an address by Serle.In the course of the first season she was seen as Emilia, Mrs. Haller, Mrs. Oakley, Gertrude in Hamlet, Lady Allworth in A New Way to pay Old Debts, Queen Margaret in Richard III, Portia, Mariana in The Wife (Knowles), Evadne, Constance, Lady Frugal in Philip Massinger's City Madam, Queen Katharine in Henry VIII; a new character in Serle's Priest's Daughter, and probably some other parts. On 21 May 1845 she took an original part in Robert Sulivan's King's Friend, and played during the season 1845‚Äì6 Julie in Richelieu by Edward Bulwer, Mrs. Beverly, Belvidera, Isabella, Elvira in Pizarro (Richard Brinsley Sheridan), Hermione, Lady Randolph, Clara Douglas in Money (Bulwer), Alicia in Jane Shore, and other parts. Warner then retired from the management of Sadler's Wells, and took on that of the Marylebone Theatre, which opened on 30 September 1847 with The Winter's Tale. She took on parts such as Julia in The Hunchback (Knowles), Lady Teazle, and Lady Townley in The Provoked Husband (John Vanburgh and Colley Cibber) for which her years began to disqualify her. She revived in November The Scornful Lady, adapted by Serle, playing in it the Lady; and in April 1848 The Double Marriage, again in Serle's adaptation. Emigration Retiring with a financial loss, Warner supported Macready at the Haymarket during his farewell performances. On 28 July 1851 Sadler's Wells was opened for a few nights before the beginning of the regular season, to give her an opportunity of playing her best known characters before starting for America. What proved to be her last appearance in England was made in August as Mrs. Oakley in The Jealous Wife. She met with great success in America. Signs of cancer showing themselves, Warner came to England, underwent an operation, and revisited New York. Unable to fulfil her engagements, she returned to London an invalid. Last years On 10 December 1853, in part through her husband's fault, Warner went through the insolvency court. A fund, to which the Queen and Angela Burdett-Coutts contributed, was raised, and a benefit was run at Sadler's Wells. Charge of her children, a boy and a girl, was taken respectively by Macready and Burdett-Coutts. After enduring a prolonged agony, Warner died on 24 September 1854 at 16 Euston Place, Euston Square. In public esteem as an actress she was surpassed in her time only by Helen Faucit and Mrs. Charles Kean. Family Around 1837 Mary Huddart married Robert William Warner, the landlord of the Wrekin Tavern, Broad Court, Bow Street, frequented by actors and literary men.

Karan Singh, who had no male issues had adopted him as his son.The Times of India Directory and Year Book Including Who's who by Sir Stanley Reed - 1949 =Family history= The Taluka of Barauli was held by his family of bargujar Rajputs who claimed to be the eldest branch of the clan settled in this area, and the other branch was settled in Bulandshahar district, who later converted to Islam. The estate was founded by the Raja Pratap Singh who had founded the town of Barauli in 1065, when there were 1656 villages attached to it, and got further 156 villages in dowry from Dor king of Kol. His father, Rao Karan Singh had won a suit in Privy Council, which established him as rightful inheritor of his ancestors several estates of around 400 villages. In January, 1913, the title of Rao for the Zamindars of Barauli was made hereditary by British authorities. =Rao of Barauli= Raj Kunwar did his schooling from Aligarh & later graduated from the Rajput College, Agra and became the Rao of Barauli upon death of Rao Karan Singh. He was a member of the district board and vice president of other committees. He was also a prominent member of Agra Province Zamindar's Association, for which he also served as a President.

Lƒ´lƒÅ≈õuka probably at King Kula≈õekhara‚Äôs court (c.900 A.D.) wrote this popular lyric on Krishna as the sexually precocious infant loved by all women but interpreted as symbolising God attracting all souls, thus an early example of Vaishnava devotional kƒÅvya. This work exists in two recensions, the southern and the western and is the canonical text of the Gaudiya Vaishnavas. K·πõ≈õ·πáa- kara·πáƒÅm·πõta is a devotional anthology of mediaeval lyric and passionate stanzas in ≈õƒÅrd≈´lavikrƒ´dita metre in honour of Krishna. It is a favourite and authoritative eulogistic work, familiar among gesture-dancers. The earliest firm date of this work is about 1367 in GangƒÅdevi‚Äôs MadhurƒÅ-vijaya, but the date of the author is uncertain. The Sanskrit poetry of Lilasuka and Jayadeva (author of Gita Govinda), created a new aesthetics of bhakti, based on a revaluation of the literary category of rasa by elaborating the vocabulary of kama and prema creatively mingling erotic love and devotion. There is deep mysticism in the poem. Lilasuka probably hailed from a southern part of India as is indicated by the metre used by him, but it is not established whether this poem was written by Bilavamangala, the noted grammarian of the 12th or 13th century, or by Bilavamangala who lived in the 9th century. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu obtained only the authentic first canto out of the three that existed. The very surname Lilasuka of the poet, is an evidence of the Bhagavata cult introduced by Madhvacharya in the West Coast, which identifies the poet with the second Bilavamangala. It is said that Lilasuka was born in Kerala near Parur in the late 13th or14th century, and lived for eighty years; that his mellifluous Sanskrit mingled with the ecstatic love for Krishna invests his songs with a quality so rare that when sung they are nectar to the ears, and that he left a life of sensuous infatuation with a courtesan named ChintƒÅmani for intense devotion to God.

Trollskogen (\\"enchanted forest\\" or \\"troll's forest\\") is a windswept, grazed pine forest and nature reserve in the northeast corner of the Baltic island √ñland, Sweden (B√∂da socken, Borgholm Municipality). The forest is on a promontory with an exposed shingle beach on the eastern side, the side of the Baltic Sea, and a sheltered bay on the western side, of Grankullaviken bay. The reserve, formerly a Dom√§nreservat (protected by the Swedish government forestry agency), is part of the B√∂da Kronopark. Its southeastern boundary is also the north border of the nature reserve B√∂dakusten √∂stra.  Description √ñland has a unique ecology containing many endemic and rare plants not found anywhere else. Trollskogen is characterized by its lichen-covered pine trees; those close to the exposed shore (a shingle beach) have been deformed by the wind. The interior of the forest contains pine trees, up to 200 years old, interspersed with old oaks, a remnant of the former grazing pastures in the Boda forests. Today, cattle still graze here, ensuring the biodiversity of the ecosystem, native grass and herb diversity. The western edge is formed by the grazed and forested areas of the Grankullaviken bay. The old oaks and pines are a rich habitat for lichens, insects, fungi, and mosses. The rich flora of the reserve includes endangered and rare species such as Pachyphiale carneola, Calicium abietinum, and Sphinctrina. More common plants include burr chervil, Prince's pine, and Baltic wormwood.  History The oldest human traces in Trollskogen are some 15 cairns and stone circles. Grankullavik, formerly called √ñrboviken, was a naval base in the 15th century, dominating much of the central Baltic Sea. Traces of fortifications remain to the east and west, and a stone wall (possibly used to demarcate a hunting domain), some long and dating from the reign of King John III (1537-1592), remains to the south. The eastern shore is the site of the wreck of the Swiks, a schooner that was wrecked on the coast on 21 December 1926; its crew of seven escaped in a lifeboat.  Visitor information The area has three hiking trails, with signage, one of which is accessible for strollers.

Epstein's academic stance suggests that medieval Jewish and Christian visual culture as mutually interdependent. In his teaching and written work, he shows that there was a curiosity regarding Christian visual culture on the part of Jews both in Iberia and Franco-Germany, resulting in equal measures of reactive avoidance and fascinated emulation of that culture. His first book conceptualized Jewish iconography as almost inevitably polemicizing against Christian images, expressing \\"messages of protest and dreams of subversion,\\"Epstein, Marc Michael.

Turkish sources claim that 4355 people died in the town of Manisa.  Background  A view of Manisa before the fire. Photograph taken from the south in northerly direction and showing the area around the Cami-i Kebir neighborhood with the Sultan and Muradiye imperial Ottoman mosques in front. A small area around these mosques were saved from the fire. Manisa is a historic town in Western Anatolia beneath the north side of Mount Sipylus that became part of the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century. During Ottoman rule the town was governed by several princes (called ≈ûehzade) and so is also known as a \\"town of the princes\\" (≈ûehzadeler ≈üehri). Many examples of Ottoman architecture were built over the next few centuries, such as the Muradiye Mosque, designed by the famous architect Mimar Sinan in 1586, and built for Murad III who was a governor of the town. By the 19th century Manisa was among the largest towns in the Aegean region of Anatolia and its population before the fire is estimated to have been between 35,000 and 50,000. Manisa had a religiously and ethnically diverse population made up of Muslims, Christians and Jews but Turkish Muslims were the largest group. During the 19th century there was an increase in other groups, most notably Greeks. In 1865 the population was estimated by the British at 40,000 with minorities of 5,000 Greeks, 2,000 Armenians and 2,000 Jews. In 1898 the population was estimated by the Ottoman linguist Sami Bey at 36,252 of which 21,000 were Muslims, 10,400 Greeks, and 2,000 Armenians. After World War I, Greece, supported by the Allied Powers, decided that the area known as the \\"Smyrna territory\\" would be occupied and could later be incorporated into Greece. In accordance with this plan, Greek forces (with Allied support) landed in Smyrna on 15 May 1919 and the town was occupied on 26 May without armed opposition. During the occupation which lasted more than three years, there were complaints by the local Turks of bad treatment. During the Greco-Turkish War that followed the Greek invasion, atrocities were committed by both Turks and Greeks.  Fire  A general view of the town with Mount Sipylus. A Turkish offensive started in August 1922 and the Greek army retreated towards Smyrna and the Aegean coast. During their retreat they practiced a scorched earth policy, burning towns and villages and committing atrocities along the way. Towns to the east of Manisa, such as Ala≈üehir and Salihli were burned. Several days before the actual fire in Manisa, rumors were going around that the town would be burned. Turkish sources claim that the Greek and Armenian population got permission to leave from the Greek army and had already evacuated the area. Other sources confirm that the Christians fled before the Turkish advance. The Turkish sources claim that the local Turks and Muslims were ordered to stay in their houses which most did until the day on which the fire started. The burning of the town was carefully managed by the Greek army, and fires were started at multiple places by specially organized groups. According to Turkish sources a significant number of the arsonists were local Greeks and Armenians. During the night of Tuesday 5 September and the morning of 6 September, fires were started in the commercial √áar≈üƒ± district (while looted was taking place) and at various other sites. Many people left their houses and fled to safety in the mountains and hills. During this chaos some people were killed by the Greeks or burnt to death. The population hid in the mountains for several days. Meanwhile, the Turkish army continued its rapid advance and, after some fighting with remaining Greek troops, they took control of the remains of the town on 8 September. By then most of the town had been destroyed. G√ºlfem Kaat√ßƒ±lar ƒ∞rem, witnessed the fire as a little girl and remembers when she fled to the hills with her family:  Aftermath  The town was almost entirely rebuilt according to a modern plan by a Turkish architect named Cemalettin. The town is believed to have lost many buildings and objects of historical significance, but a small area around the two imperial Ottoman mosques were saved from destruction. Today the town has grown again and had reached 309,050 inhabitants in 2012. = Damage = A picture of a street after the fire. The Turkish government set up a commission called Tetkik-i Mezalim or Tetkik-i Fecayi Heyeti \\"the atrocity committee\\" to research and document the events and atrocities. Turkish author Halide Edip saw the town after the fire, as did Henry Franklin-Bouillon, the French government representative, who declared that out of 11,000 houses in the city of Magnesia (Manisa) only 1,000 remained. Patrick Kinross wrote, \\"Out of the eighteen thousand buildings in the historic holy city of Manisa, only five hundred remained.\\" The total economic damage was estimated to be more than fifty million lira (in contemporary value). Some of the captured Greek soldiers were employed in the reconstruction, such as in the rebuilding of the destroyed Karak√∂y mosque. Loder Park, who toured much of the devastated area immediately after the Greek evacuation, described the situation he had seen as follows:U.S. Vice-Consul James Loder Park to Secretary of State, Smyrna, 11 April 1923. US archives US767.68116/34 = Victims = Map of western Anatolia and location of Manisa and other towns. The total number of victims during the fire is not known. Turkish sources estimate that 3,500 died in the fires and 855 were shot. A comparison can be made with several nearby towns which were also burned by the retreating Greeks. There were estimated to be 3,000 victims in Ala≈üehir and 1,000 in Turgutlu. The number that were wounded is also unknown. Turkish sources state that three hundred girls were raped and abducted by the Greeks. Many rape victims were thought to have remained silent out of fear or shame. A number of Greeks troops were captured, some of them were lynched by the Turkish women they had raped. The Greek retreat was accompanied by looting and other people lost their possessions in the fires, and lived for some time among the ruins of their homes or crowded together in the surviving buildings. = In Turkish literature = The Turkish journalist Falih Rƒ±fkƒ± Atay wrote: The Turkish poet ƒ∞lhan Berk was a small child living in the Deveciler neighborhood at the time of the fire and fled to the mountains with his family. His older sister burned to death in their house. He wrote that he could never forget the flight to the mountains and wrote of other childhood memories of the events in his work Uzun Bir Adam. The historian Kamil Su, also witnessed the fire as a 13-year-old living in the Alaybey neighborhood. On the morning of September 6 he fled with his family to the mountains. When he returned to his neighborhood he found corpses in the streets and most buildings razed to their foundations, only the walls of the historic Aydƒ±n mosque were still standing; the corpse of an unknown man lay in the street in front of where Su's house had stood. He later wrote Manisa ve Y√∂resinde ƒ∞≈ügal Acƒ±larƒ±, a book about the Greek occupation and the fire.  Gallery  Manisa view old picture.jpgA view from the hills above the town.

She has graced the covers of several magazines in Myanmar, including Focus Online, Lifestyle, Fashion Image, SH and been featured in FHM (Singapore) & Female (Singapore). She has completed her bachelor's degree in Digital Filmmaking at the Art, Design & Media school of Nanyang Technological University. Early life Lynn Yang Wolf was born on June 30, 1989 in Hong Kong to a German father and Myanmar (Shan) mother. Her father, Guenther Ernst Wolf (born October 30, 1950) worked previously as a chemist in a laboratory in Germany before moving to Hong Kong to work as a sales manager. Her mother, Faith Yang (born May 8, 1955) is the daughter of Sao Edward Yang Kyein Sai who was a Saopha of the region Kokang. She has one younger sister, Ming Yang Wolf (born January 3, 1995) and one younger brother, Marcus Yang Wolf (born July 7, 1996). She attended the German Swiss International School (GSIS) in Hong Kong, before relocating to Yangon to continue her studies in the Yangon International Educare Centre (YIEC). In high school, Lynn was the captain of the basketball team and competed in volleyball. She was also in the student council and the YIEC's first Chief Editor of the yearbook. She left YIEC after Grade 11 due to bullying but had earned enough credits to graduate.  Career  Wolf's first modeling gigs were for Adidas in Myanmar and the billboard girl for Star Cola company at age 15. In 2005, encouraged by a local talent scout she entered her first beauty pageant, the Miss Dagon Centre contest in Myanmar and won. Shortly after, she moved to Singapore where was scouted on the MRT by then Channel V VJ host Simone Heng. She then went on to do several print ads including the Victorious Gems campaign, a Myanmar jewellery brand based in Singapore which gained her popularity. At 18, she completed her diploma is Mass Communication with TMC Academy she moved back to Yangon where she worked with her father at the Stamford City Business Institute as a Marketing Executive in 2007. She enrolled in New York University (NYU) as an Economics major in 2008 and did her first year study abroad NYU's Florence campus in Italy. She then applied to Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and transferred to a major in Digital Filmmaking. Model career Her first break was in 2003 when she was approached by Adidas Myanmar to be featured in their campaign. She was quickly found by Star Cola soon after which led on to major billboards in Yangon. She was nicknamed \\"The Star Cola Girl.\\" However the modeling industry in Myanmar at that time was not interested in Pan-Asian faces. In Singapore Lynn had better luck finding jobs especially in print ads and music videos. However, there was a large number of Pan-Asian models in the market which made it hard to stand out. Her big break came in 2011 when she was selected to participate in Supermodel Me (Season 3), a reality TV show that consisted of a group of models competing for an array of prizes. She was the first contestant in Supermodel Me history to be disqualified. She was then featured FEMALE magazine's \\"FEMALE's 50 Gorgeous People\\" (November 2011) and FHM (Singapore) (August 2012). In June 2013, Lynn's modeling career in Myanmar finally took off after the country opened up towards international change and her look was suddenly in demand. Being one of the few mixed heritage Myanmar models, she quickly gained celebrity status. In August 2013, Lynn starred as a guest mentor and judge on Myanmar's first modeling reality TV show, The Model Academy (Season 1) alongside supermodel, creator and host Thundah Hlaing. She is currently the brand ambassador for the bikini line, Segovia. Controversy During the filming of Supermodel Me (Season 3) Lynn and another competitor snuck out of the model house in the middle of the night and came back 2 hour later, intoxicated. She claimed to not be the person in charge of the arrangement of sneaking out but was still disqualified in an unexpected elimination. Her competitor was voted to still compete but with a disadvantage at the next photoshoot. The New Paper later reported that Lynn's cat had died during her filming of Supermodel Me (Season 3) something she only found out when she snuck out of the model house and into her own house in Singapore, and therefore, was not in a mood to put up a good explanation to avoid disqualification. Lynn also claimed that a rival competitor had tricked her to sneak out, and in the Reunion episode of Supermodel Me (Season 3) was able to clear the air with the audience of her sudden disqualification. She was considered for a comeback in Supermodel Me (Season 4) but later rejected.

After the war he was a prominent player for Lafayette College during the 1948 and 1949 football seasons. The Sun Bowl Committee's decision to exclude Showell from the game due to his race led to Lafayette's rejection of its Sun Bowl invitation and the subsequent student protests at the college.  Early life  Color poster of a Tuskegee Airman David Showell was born on October 14, 1924. Showell and his eight siblings spent their childhood at 816 Madison Avenue in Prospect Park, Pennsylvania. During his childhood and adolescent years, Showell attended Lincoln Elementary School, Washington Junior High, and Prospect Park High where he played baseball and football. As a high school senior he excelled in football, and he was the top scorer in Delaware County, Pennsylvania with 135 points during the 1942 season. In the same season, he led his team to three championships: the Suburban Class A and B and the Chester Pike Conference. He was awarded many accolades for his athletic talent and was honored at Ridley Township's annual football banquet when they presented him with a cup for being its most outstanding opponent that season. Showell was also chosen for the All-Delco, All-Scholastic, and All-Suburban teams. The Prospect Park yearbook named him \\"one of the greatest backs ever to play for Prospect Park High.\\"  Second World War service  After graduating from Prospect Park High in 1943, Showell joined the U.S. Army. During his time in the Army, he attended flight school where he became a member of the Tuskegee Airmen, a unit of black Army Air Corps pilots during World War II. Showell first experienced significant racial discrimination when he joined the military, where he and his fellow airmen were rarely called into action because of the color of their skin. Showell was discharged from the U.S. Army in October 1945. College and later life In 1947, Showell began his freshman year at Lafayette College, a small liberal arts college in Easton, Pennsylvania, where he played on the Lafayette Leopards football team for four years, starring at halfback. At the end of the 1948 season, Showell was excluded from an invitation the team received to play in the Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas on January 1, 1949. This discriminatory event sparked much controversy, not only within Lafayette College, but across the country. Lafayette decided not to send its team to the Sun Bowl in response to the Sun Bowl Committee's decision to exclude Showell from the game due to the segregation laws in Texas, which led to large student protests at the college against racial discrimination. In 1951, Showell graduated from Lafayette College and earned his bachelor's degree in business. After his undergraduate years, Showell attended the University of Wisconsin Law School. He was critically injured in a traffic accident on December 23, 1955, when a coal truck he was driving overturned; he died hours later at Taylor Hospital in Ridley Park, Pennsylvania, at the age of 31.

A great connoisseur and admirer of the poet Si Mohand, Slimane Azem included in his songs different isefra (traditional poetry) by this author. Biography Slimane Azem was born September 19, 1918 at Agouni Gueghrane, a small village located on the foothills of Djurdjura. Nothing predestined this son of a poor farmer to a musical career. A rather mediocre student, he had a passion for the La Fontaine's Fables that would later influence his writings and compositions. At the age of 11, he became a farm worker for a colonist in Staou√©li, a small resort near Algiers (the very beach were the French army landed in 1830). In 1937, he landed at Longwy as part of the Service du travail obligatoire and found work in a steel mill operation before being mobilized during the \\"Phoney War\\" in Issoudun. In 1940, he was discharged and went to Paris where he was hired as an assistant electrician in the Paris M√©tro. In 1942, Slimane was in Paris. The capital fascinated him and yet the work was hard. He was accustomed to life in the village in the great outdoors, but was now confined in tunnels and underground eight hours a day in the metro. Two years later, he underwent deportation by German troops in the Rhineland and remained there until its liberation in 1945, by the Americans. Having received death threats during the independence of Algeria, the singer was fled to France in 1962. He then became a legendary voice that Kabyles expatriates could only listen to on Radio Paris in his quart d'heure kabyle (fifteen minutes Kabyle daily) show. Azem was, in fact, banned from airing in his own country and his music circulated only clandestinely, his name could only be read in lowercase in brief, daily of his country. In 1970 he was awarded a gold disc along with the singer Noura, imposing it as one of the best French sales. At the same time he became member of the SACEM, the club of famous French stars. In Paris, he won a stewardship coffee in the 15th arrondissement. He took the opportunity to interpret there his first compositions. Noticed and encouraged by Mohamed El Kamel, former member of Bachtarzi ensemble (named after Mahieddine Bachtarzi), he persevered in singing. Slimane finally recorded his first album with the song A muh muh has. For all those Kabyles dealing with homesickness, his records were highly sought after at Madame Sauviat, the only record store that sold at that time albums of Maghrebi and Oriental artists. This woman, of Auvergne origin, whose heirs now keep the shop on Boulevard de la Chapelle, presented Slimane to the record company Path√©-Marconi. During the '70s, he made comic duets with the famous Cheikh Nouredine and sang Alg√©rie, mon beau pays (Algeria, my beautiful country) and Carte de R√©sidence (Residence Card) in French. Over the recordings, Slimane Azem conquered a wide community audience through his lyrics parables where he staged animals and arises as a singer politically engaged. Then his inspiration declined. He would later write a song in tribute to the Berber Spring, ∆îef Teqbaylit yuli was (On Kabylia rises the day). He never denied his peasant roots and spent much of his earnings in buying a farm in Moissac (Tarn-et-Garonne), where he spent six months a year cultivating his nostalgia in his fig and olive tree plantations. Slimane feared death in exile. It finally occurred a January 28, 1983 on his farm. Since 2008, the city of Moissac decided to honor the old Berber singer giving a town square that bears his name.Max Lagarrigue,Pr√®s de 250 personnes ont honor√© le chanteur Slimane Azem, La D√©p√™che du Midi, 3 novembre 2008. In December 2013, the city of Paris decided to honor him too with a square in the 14th arrondissement. The plate was not visible however until 2014.

He is a successful steeplechaser, winning the RSA Chase in 2013 and the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2014. Background Lord Windermere is a bay gelding with a white blaze and three white socks bred in Ireland by Edmond Coleman. He was sired by Oscar, a horse who finished second to Peintre Celebre in the Prix du Jockey Club before becoming a leading sire of National Hunt horses. His other major winners have included Big Zeb (Queen Mother Champion Chase), Rock On Ruby (Champion Hurdle), Oscar Whisky (Aintree Hurdle), Peddlers Cross (Baring Bingham Novices' Hurdle), Black Jack Ketchum (Sefton Novices' Hurdle) and At Fishers Cross (Spa Novices' Hurdle). Lord Windermere's name is a reference to the Oscar Wilde play Lady Windermere's Fan. His dam, Satellite Dancer, showed no signs of racing ability when being well beaten in all three of her races in 1999. As a descendant of the broodmare Nantua, she was distantly related to the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Nikellora. As a colt foal, Lord Windermere was sent to the Tattersalls Ireland in November 2006 and was bought for ‚Ç¨30,000 by the County Kildare- based Kennycourt Stud. As a three-year-old gelding, Lord Windermere was offered for sale at Tattersalls Ireland in June and at Doncaster in August, but failed to find a buyer. In December 2010, the gelding was offered for sale for the fourth time when he was sent to the Cheltenham Breeze-Up sale and was bought for ¬£75,000 by the trainer and former jockey Jim Culloty. The horse entered the ownership of Ronan Lambe and was sent into training with Culloty at Mallow, County Cork. Racing career =2011/2012 National Hunt season: Novice hurdles= Lord Windermere began his racing career in novice hurdle races and was ridden in all of his races in the 2011/2012 National Hunt season by Tom Doyle. When Doyle rode the horse for the first time he told Culloty \\"this is the one you've been waiting for\\". He made an inauspicious debut, falling at the fourth hurdle when starting a 28/1 outsider at Cork. He was little better fancied when he reappeared at Thurles Racecourse on 17 November, but recorded his first success, beating Golanbrook by six lengths at odds of 25/1. He was moved up in class in December for a Listed race at Punchestown and prevailed by a head from the favourite Dylan Ross. In the Grade I Deloitte Novice Hurdle at Leopardstown in February he started at odds of 10/1 and finished fourth behind Benefficient. Lord Windermere returned to winning form at Naas in March, beating the four-year-old Ballynacree by three lengths over two miles. On his last appearance of the season, the gelding made little impact in a Grade II event over two and a half miles at Fairyhouse in April, finishing eighth behind the Jessica Harrington-trained Jenari. =2012/2013 National Hunt season: Novice chases= Tom Doyle kept the ride in the following season, when Lord Windermere was campaigned in novice steeplechases. He made his debut over the larger obstacles on 11 November when he finished second to Dylan Ross at Navan Racecourse. He then finished second to Mikael d'Haguenet at Punchestown on 9 December and then won his first chase three weeks later at Leopardstown, beating the Willie Mullins-trained Marasonnien by two lengths. When moved up in class he finished second to Texas Jack in a Grade II event at Leopardstown on 26 January and third behind Boston Bob in the Grade I Dr P. J. Moriarty Novice Chase at the same course two weeks later. At the Cheltenham Festival on 13 March, Lord Windermere started at odds of 8/1 for the Grade I RSA Chase over three miles in which he was ridden for the first time by Davy Russell. Before the race Culloty, in an interview with the Festival website explained that he felt the horse would be well suited by racing over a longer distance and on firmer ground than he had previously encountered. Russell restrained the gelding at the rear of the field before beginning to make progress four fences from the finish. He made a jumping error at the next obstacle before moving up to second when Boston Bob fell at the second last. He took the lead 150 yards from the finish and won by one and three quarter lengths from Lyreen Legend. After the race, Culloty said \\"we knew this horse would like Cheltenham and it's all paid off. I fancied him like mad ‚Äì I thought he'd love the ground here =2013/2014 National Hunt season= Lord Windermere began his third season in the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury Racecourse in England in which he was assigned a weight of 162 pounds. Ridden by Dougie Costello, he was never able to reach the leaders and finished eighth of the sixteen finishers behind the Nicky Henderson-trained Triolo d'Alene. Costello again took the ride when Lord Windermere finished seventh behind Bobs Worth in the Lexus Chase at Leopardstown in December. Russell reclaimed the ride when the gelding started at odds of 6/1 for the Irish Hennessy Gold Cup on 9 February. Lord Windermere briefly disputed second place before finishing sixth behind Last Instalment. On 14 March, Lord Windermere started a 20/1 outsider for the 2014 Cheltenham Gold Cup in a field which included Bobs Worth, Triolo d'Alene and Last Instalment. The race was run later than scheduled after several jockeys (including Ruby Walsh and Daryl Jacob) were injured in earlier races and was further delayed by two false starts. After racing in last place for most of the way, Lord Windermere began to make progress after the fourth last, but was still in eighth place turning into the straight. He jumped the last in fourth behind Silviniaco Conti, Bobs Worth and On His Own. On the run-in Silviniaco Conti and Bobs Worth, racing on the inside, were unable to make further progress and the race for first place turned into a struggle between Lord Windermere, On His Own and The Giant Bolster all of whom drifted to the right side of the course. In a finish described as \\"dramatic\\" and \\"controversial\\", Lord Windermere prevailed by a short head from On His Own, with The Giant Bolster three quarters of a length back in third. The racecourse stewards held an inquiry into possible interference between the first three finishers, but allowed the result to stand. Jim Culloty, who had won the race three times as a jockey on Best Mate said \\"Halfway round I was going to sack the jockey! He's not moved a muscle and he's come from nowhere. It's a dream ‚Äì I'll wake up in a minute\\". Russell, who had earlier won the Triumph Hurdle on Tiger Roll said \\"I can't believe it, I was never on the bridle. I was never in the race, the whole field was in front of me for the whole race, I had to sit and suffer the whole way. I didn't use any petrol, I went around the inside and he jumped great. The whole way round I was hunting, I thought the race had gone. I was on the best horse in the race. He was very idle, like he was last year\\". He also admitted \\"I honestly thought on the first circuit that I could be pulling him up and keeping him OK for Punchestown. We managed to keep him going though and, all of a sudden, I knew I had a lot of horse under me. I thought I had a squeak jumping the first fence on the second circuit and then, at the top of the hill, I knew we were in with a chance. He's jumped super. If you leave him alone, he has more confidence, so I didn‚Äôt want to do anything for show. He's a confidence horse, so I didn‚Äôt want to pick my stick up\\". David Casey, who took the ride on On My Own after Ruby Walsh's injury, said that \\"with a straight run, I would have won the race\\". =2014/2015 National Hunt season= On his first appearance of the new season, Lord Windermere was brought back in distance for the John Durkan Memorial Punchestown Chase over two and a half miles on 7 December. He was held up as usual before finishing well to take third behind Don Cossack and Boston Bob. He started 5/1 third favourite for the Lexus Chase three weeks later, but finished seventh behind Road To Riches . In the Hennessy Gold Cup in February, he took the lead approaching the second last but was overtaken at the final obstacle and finished third behind Carlingford Lough and Foxrock. In March Lord Windermere returned to Cheltenham to defend the Gold Cup and started a 20/1 outsider. As in 2014, he dropped to last on the first circuit but on this occasion he failed to make any late progress and was pulled up by Russell at the second last. The horse's owner was unhappy with Davy Russell's performance and insisted that he should not ride Lord Windermere again. Robbie McNamara was booked to ride the horse in the Grand National but after being injured in a fall at Wexford Racecourse he was replaced by Brian O'Connell. Lord Windermere was pulled up before the second Valentine's Brook in the subsequent Grand National.

For the Soviet practice of mandating citizens identity papers (internal passports), see Propiska in the Soviet Union. Passportization is a process by which Russian authorities have induced persons, usually holders of former Soviet passports, to apply for Russian passports. As the number of Russian passport holders in regions of adjoining nations grows, Russia then invokes its national interest in defending its citizens by promoting the independence or annexation of these regions.  Georgia  In Georgia this occurred in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, where residents continued to be the citizens of Soviet Union and kept Soviet passports even a decade after the break-up of the Soviet Union. In 2002, a new Citizenship Law of Russia simplified acquisition of citizenship for any citizen of the Soviet Union, regardless current place of residence. In Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Russian nationalist non-governmental organizations such as the Congress of Russian Communities of Abkhazia carried papers to a nearby Russian city for processing so that residents did not need to travel to obtain Russian citizenship. By June 25, 2002, approximately 150,000 Abkhazians had gained Russian citizenship in addition to the 50,000 who already possessed it, with the blessing of authorities in Sukhum. The Georgian Foreign Ministry denounced the passport allocation as an ‚Äúunprecedented illegal campaign‚Äù. On February 1, 2011, Soviet passports were no longer considered valid for crossing the Russian-Abkhaz border. In April 2009, the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities stated there was \\"pressure being exercised on the Georgian population in the Gali District through the limitation of their education rights, compulsory \\"passportization\\", forced conscription into the Abkhaz military forces and restrictions on their freedom of movement.\\"OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities deeply concerned by recent developments in Abkhazia.

Again, the A-Division provided the qualifiers, with the top four teams in that competition being awarded places in the National League alongside regional teams. The league was sponsored by Coca-Cola. Druk United won the Championship on goal difference from Ugyen Academy and, as a result of the abolition of the AFC President's Cup, will be the first team from Bhutan to take part in the AFC Cup. A-Division The 2014 season started on 8 March 2014 and ended on 4 May 2014. Druk United won the A-Division and were joined in the National League by Thimpu City, Druk Pol and Druk Star. =League table= =Results= National League This season, the federation increased the prize money from Nu 400,000 to 700,000 for the winners. First runners up would be given Nu 400,000, up by 200,000 from last year and the second runners up would be awarded Nu 200,000, double from last year‚Äôs prize. No place is awarded to the team finishing in first place this season for the AFC President's Cup. This is because 2014 is the final edition of the cup to be held. Instead, the six teams which qualify for the 2014 AFC President's Cup final stage will enter the 2015 AFC Cup play-offs, and from 2015 onwards, centralized qualifiers will determine six teams which enter the AFC Cup play- offs. Since Ugyen Academy lost all three of their games in the 2014 competition, there will be no Bhutanese representative in the AFC Cup until at least 2016. The national league has struggled to attract spectators though, with only around fifty people attending matches, even when top teams are involved. This is in contrast to prior years when large crowds would come to Changlimithang even for inter-school tournaments and this downturn in spectator numbers has been attributed to the widespread availability of foreign leagues on television providing a much greater level of entertainment. Additionally, difficulties in obtaining visa's for foreign players to play in the National League inhibit its attraction to local spectators. Thimphu City attempted to bring a player in from the English Premier League, but were unable to do so because of visa issues. =Teams= A total of six teams competed in the league: four teams representing Thimphu, who qualified as a result of their final positions in the 2014 A-Division, and two teams representing other districts. *Bhutan Clearing (representing Chukha District) *Druk Pol (third place in the 2014 A-Division) *Druk Star (fourth place in the 2014 A-Division) *Druk United (winners of the 2014 A-Division) *Thimphu City (runners-up in the 2014 A-Division) *Ugyen Academy (representing Punakha District) =League table= =Results= A number of the results above are disputed. Druk United v Thimphu City was also reported as a 5‚Äì0 win for Druk United, not 4‚Äì0. Druk Pol were reported to have beaten Bhutan Clearing 6‚Äì1, not 6‚Äì0. The match between Druk United and Bhutan Clearing may have finished 4‚Äì0 to Druk United, not 4‚Äì1.

Services =Custom Store Builder= Storenvy first launched as an online store builder in 2010. The platform allows store owners, makers and artists to open an online store for free and customize it. Store upgrades include custom domain usage and discounts. =Storenvy Marketplace= When merchants open a store on Storenvy, their products are also featured on the Storenvy Marketplace, combining the aspects of a store builder and a marketplace. =Pop-up store= In cooperation with Storefront Inc., Storenvy leased retail space in Downtown San Francisco and made it available to member merchants as a pop-up store. Five online sellers at a time can set up a physical shop there for one month, after which they are replaced by five other sellers. Pricing In January 2014, the company announced it would begin collecting a percentage of sales made on the Marketplace section of the site. Custom Store sales would remain free. This change would allow the company to become profitable, according to Fox Business News. History Jonathan Crawford, founder and original CEO, first had the idea for the business in 2008, while running a web design and development agency in Kansas City, Missouri. He thought there should be an easier way for people to set up their own stores online. He initially ran the business out of his garage. In 2010, he launched the store builder that would become known as Storenvy. In early 2011, the company raised a seed round of $1.53 million. In late 2012, the Storenvy Marketplace launched with over 35,000 brands. Shortly thereafter, the company raised a Series A round, bringing total funding to over $6.5 million. In Spring 2016, Storenvy was purchased by The Opensky Project and founder, Jonathan Crawford, left the company.

Plot At a Save Greendale committee meeting, Jeff (Joel McHale), Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown), and Professor Hickey (Jonathan Banks) agree to clean out one of Greendale's storage rooms. Abed (Danny Pudi) and his girlfriend Rachel (Brie Larson), have been dating for a month and she recently purchased him an old VCR videogame called \\"Pile of Bullets.\\" Abed asks Annie (Alison Brie) if he can have Rachel over for dinner tonight, but Annie reveals that she has already invited her estranged brother Anthony (Spencer Crittenden) to dinner. Abed is able to convince Annie to make the dinner a double date with both Rachel and Anthony. At the dinner, Anthony proves himself extremely helpful by fixing Annie and Abed's fridge door. This leads Annie to ask Abed if Anthony can move into the apartment. Abed is against the idea as he wants his girlfriend Rachel to move into the apartment. Throughout the night, Abed and Annie attempt to convince one another that their preferred candidate would be a better roommate. Abed eventually makes a deal with Annie that whoever wins a game of \\"Pile of Bullets\\", their preferred candidate will become their roommate. Abed, Annie, Rachel and Anthony attempt to play the game, but are confused by its nonsensical rules and directions. Rachel eventually uncovers Abed and Annie's deal and breaks up with Abed as she feels manipulated. Anthony also leaves the apartment, as he believes that Annie and Abed still haven't properly dealt with Troy's absence. Abed visits Rachel, and performs a final act romantic comedy apology, which wins Rachel back. Meanwhile, Jeff, Shirley and Hickey stumble across a pack of mint condition Chemistry textbooks while they are cleaning the storage room. The group realize that the textbooks are extremely valuable, and decide to sell them instead of handing them into the school. The group contacts Britta, who agrees to organize a buyer for the books in exchange for a cut of the profits. Chang then walks in on the scheme. The group coerces him to confess that he stole the books while being filmed by Britta. Realizing that things have gone too far, Jeff wants out of the plan. Shirley doesn't allow this, and has Jeff tied up along with Chang. Britta's buyer is ready to meet with Britta, but Jeff manages to convince Shirley and Hickey that Britta could double-cross them. Shirley decides to complete the sale herself, and ties up Britta and Hickey. When Shirley meets with Britta's contact (Paul Williams), he reveals that the textbooks have no page numbers, and the whole bundle is only worth $20 as recycled paper. Shirley, realizing her mistake, frees Hickey, Britta, Chang and Jeff. The group comes together for another Save Greendale committee meeting the next day, where Abed admits to Annie that he has been missing Troy. Abed and Annie then agree to find a roommate on Craigslist. During the credits in 1993, it is shown that Devon (Vince Gilligan), the host of the \\"Pile of Bullets\\" videogame, worked for Apple, before being convinced by his wife (Gina Gershon) to quit the \\"sinking ship\\" of Apple, since, according to her, VCR videogames was where the future was heading. (In fact, Apple's market valuation did plunge in 1993, not reaching similar levels until the tech boom five years later, and not fully recovering until more than a decade later.https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:AAPL) Reception =Ratings= Upon airing, episode was watched by 2.77 million American viewers, and received an 18-49 rating/share of 1.0/4.

It was presented at the 123rd meeting of the Shanghai City Government in July 1929 and as one of its provisions allocated 7,000mu (~4.6km2) in the modern day Jiangwan Subdistrict of Shanghai's Yangpu District for the construction of a government headquarters and administration centre. Had it been completed, the government headquarters building would have stood close to the junction of today's Hengren Road (ÊÅí‰ªÅË∑Ø) and the Qingyuan Ring Road (Ê∏ÖÊ∫êÁéØË∑Ø) (). Following the fall of Shanghai to the Japanese in 1937, implementation of the plan stopped. By October 1938, the occupying army had come up with their own \\"Greater Shanghai Metropolitan Plan\\" (), which was a modified version of the original. When the war ended in 1945 with the Japanese surrender, the Nationalist Government returned to power. It did not continue with the plan but instead constructed a number of new roads and repaired damaged buildings. From then until 1952, land previously allocated under the plan was gradually subsumed by development of the Jiangwan District.  Background  In July 1927, the Nationalist Government headquartered in Nanking under Chiang Kai-shek established the Shanghai Special City Government (‰∏äÊµ∑ÁâπÂà´Â∏ÇÊîøÂ∫ú). The city remained remarkably prosperous despite tripartite struggles between Nationalist, Communist and warlord factions in various parts of China, largely on the account of the International Settlement and the French Concession. The Nationalist-controlled Chinese walled city in the Nanshi area (ÂçóÂ∏Ç) and the northern Zhabei District were small in comparison to the areas under foreign administration, held a burgeoning population and were unsuitable for expansion. As a result, the Nanking Government considered large scale redevelopment a key task and in July 1929 decided to proceed with the acquisition of land northeast of the city adjacent to the Huangpu River. In 1922, this area had also been earmarked by Sun Yat-sen, founder of the Chinese Republic, as the center of China's development plans with a view to Shanghai becoming a global commercial centre. By 1931, the new Shanghai Special City Government had approved and started work on the Greater Shanghai Plan, utilising ideas drawn from British expert Ebenezer Howard's 1902 book Garden Cities of Tomorrow. The grid layout also followed contemporary trends in European and American urban planning.  Plan detail  The major elements of the plan were divided into four sections: * City center plan: Comprising 1,000mu (~ 0.66km2) and shaped like the stylized Chinese character zhong (‰∏≠) meaning \\"centre\\", this area would contain government buildings each with its own exercise area. There would also have been a museum, a library, a hospital and a sports stadium suitable for staging national events. * A railway line connecting the city centre with a port on the Huangpu River and a railway line with goods depot near modern-day Qiujiang Road (). * Division of the city into zones with the central area surrounded by industrial and residential areas. * Traffic system: :: A grid of high speed roads leading out from the central government buildings in the centre to the west and south with a web of interconnected roads to the north and east. :: Construction of Zhongshan North (‰∏≠Â±±ÂåóË∑Ø) and Zhongshan West Road (‰∏≠Â±±Ë•øË∑Ø) leading to the southern downtown area and Qimei Road (ÂÖ∂ÁæéË∑Ø), modern day Siping Road, (ÂõõÂπ≥Ë∑Ø) and Huangxing Road (ÈªÑÂÖ¥Ë∑Ø) connecting to the International Settlement in the north west. :: A further 23 roads leading to Pudong, Jiangqiao and other local areas.  Implementation  = Funding = Once implementation of the plan began, the Nationalist Government issued bonds to cover the necessary construction funds. In 1929 they floated the First Phase Municipal Bond to raise 3,000,000 Chinese yuan based on marketable land values of between 200 and 600 yuan per Chinese acre. A land tax was further levied on the 5,400 mu that made up the proposed city centre area. Outside of this area, a surplus 829 mu of land was divided into two grades and sold for 2,500 yuan and 2,000 yuan per mu respectively, generating a profit of 1,795,560 yuan. = New city hall = Shanghai City Hall in the 1930s The 1,000 mu site earmarked for the new Shanghai City Hall lay at the centre of the planned city. On 1October 1929 a design competition for the new building was launched with a prize of 3,000 yuan. The government announced architect Dong Dayou (Ëë£Â§ßÈÖâ) as the winner in February 1930 while further amendments were made to the overall plan. Work officially began on the site in June 1931 and was scheduled for completion the following year. However, Chinese nationalist forces clashed with the Japanese army in the January 28 Incident as Shanghai came under attack and the area between the Wujiaochang District (the modern day Yangpu District) and the Huangpu River, at the heart of the construction project, became a battlefield. Work ceased until the announcement of a ceasefire in March 1932 then in July the project restarted and was formally completed on 10October. Five other buildings were completed at the same time representing a total development area of at a cost of 780,000 yuan. The new complex opened at the end of the year. = Other facilities = Work on a 300 mu (~200,000 m2) sports field began in August 1934 at the same time as a stadium and a swimming pool nearby. At the end of the same year, construction started on the Shanghai Municipal Library (‰∏äÊµ∑Â∏ÇÁ´ãÂõæ‰π¶È¶Ü) and the Shanghai Municipal Museum (‰∏äÊµ∑Â∏ÇÁ´ãÂçöÁâ©È¶Ü), both designed by Dong Dayou.  Notable buildings  * Shanghai Nationalist Government Building () * Shanghai Municipal Stadium () (Now the Jiangwan Sports Center) * Shanghai Municipal Library () * Shanghai Municipal Museum () * Shanghai Municipal Hospital and Health Institute ()  Denoument  The area suffered significant damage during World War II and thereafter the development focus shifted towards the southwest of Shanghai.

It is a registered charity and care home, specialising in caring for children with multiple and profound disabilities. Hollybank Trust was established in 1954 in Lindley, a suburb of Huddersfield in Yorkshire. Huddersfield is known for its central role at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, for being the birthplace of rugby league and birthplace of the former British Prime Minister, Harold Wilson. It is in the process of expanding into adult social care. According to its website it employs over 500 full and part-time staff at locations across Yorkshire, in Mirfield, Halifax, Holmfirth, Barnsley and South Kirkby. Local Paralympian athlete Paul Cartwright, is ambassador for the Hollybank School, which he attended as a boy. Paul represented Great Britain at the 1984 Stoke Mandeville Paralympic Games in 100 m, 200 m, 400 m sprint, and the marathon.  History  Hollybank began in 1954 in Lindley. According to local speculation an elderly lady, as yet still unidentified, helping disabled children because she herself had lived in a family with disabled sisters whom became subject to the Mental Health Act. The sisters were allegedly sectioned for mental health when they should have been looked after for disablement. This was the motivation for opening Holly Bank, and with financial assistance from the Smith Homes Trust, was the first school for disabled children built in the North of England. Other schools followed in Harrogate and Leeds. In 1990, the school re-located to Roe Head in Mirfield, Yorkshire, a town situated between Huddersfield and Dewsbury and it became a registered charity in its own right (Hollybank Trust) in 1994. Part of the Hollybank Trust, has connections with the Bront√´ family. The Roe Head property in Mirfield which the Hollybank Trust acquired in 1990 was a former Victorian boarding school for girls. In 1831, Charlotte Bront√´ was enrolled at the Roe Head school of Miss Wooler, and subsequently went on to be Wooler's assistant three years later. All three Bront√´ sisters were educated at Roe Head School between 1831 and 1838. Appropriately the location is still used as a school to this day, albeit one for special requirements.  Activities  Hollybank Special School in Mirfield provides specialised education, therapy and care for children from 5 to 19 years of age. The trust also has a children's home and adult residential homes both in the community and at its main site. All children and young people attending Hollybank have physical disabilities and additional complex needs. Hollybank specialise in supporting physical disabilities, learning disabilities, sensory disabilities, . There are residential and non- residential facilities. Staff include qualified therapists and nurses. Hollybank ran a video campaign in 2012 to leverage support via social media, drawing attention to their work ‚Äì the campaign was called Give it up for Hollybank. They also organised a charity sky diving event in April 2013 for a number of disabled children. For more than 10 years the Hollybank Trust has been sending groups during the summer and spring seasons to Otley Sailing Club in the parish of Leeds to learn and experience all the benefits of sailing. The BBC produced a 'Get Inspired' video in December 2015, which featured an Otley Club dinghy used by Holly Bank Trust and sponsored by a Preston based business Freightlink.co.uk. Freightlink also help Hollybank organise and fund the Otley Club sailing days. In January 2014, a group of 15 ambassadors from the local community worked with staff from the UK office of Chiquita Brands International to take on a series of fundraising challenges.

She was launched in late 1939 as the first of her class but was found to be unstable, and had to undergo significant modifications before entering service in March 1940. Construction and design Atherstone was ordered from Cammell Laird of Birkenhead on 21 March 1939, as one of the first batch of ten Hunt-class destroyers.English 1987, p. 17. The Hunts were intended to make up for a shortage in destroyer-type vessels, particularly for escort duties. They were to combine the heavy anti-aircraft armament of the s (i.e. six 4 inch (102 mm) QF Mk XVI dual purpose (anti-ship and anti-aircraft) guns in three twin mounts) with a speed of (compared with for the Bitterns) to allow them to work with the fleet when necessary.English 1987, pp. 7‚Äì9.Lenton 1970, p. 83. This was supplemented by a close-in anti-aircraft armament of a quadruple 2-pounder \\"pom-pom\\", and an anti-submarine armament of 30 depth charges. No torpedo- tubes were to be carried.Whitley 2000, pp. 143‚Äì144. Atherstone was laid down on 8 June 1939 and launched on 12 December 1939. An inclining test when the ship was fitting out showed that she, and by extension all the Hunts, was dangerously unstable owing to a design error. To restore stability to acceptable levels, one twin 4 inch mount was removed, the ship's superstructure and funnel was cut down and additional ballast was fitted.English 1987, p. 11. Thus modified, Atherstone was completed and commissioned (with the pennant number L05English 1987, p. 106.) on 23 March 1940. Service Following commissioning and initial trials, Atherstone joined the First Destroyer Flotilla based at Portsmouth employed on convoy escort duties in the English Channel.English 1987, p. 29. In June and July, she was detached to the Home Fleet, returning to Portsmouth in August. On 11 September 1940, while escorting Convoy CW11 in the Channel, Atherstone was hit by two bombs and near missed by a third, sustaining serious damage and killing 5 men. After repair at Chatham Dockyard, the ship rejoined the First Destroyer Flotilla in January 1941, resuming convoy escort duty in the Channel. In December 1941, after a refit at Southampton, Atherstone transferred to the 15th Destroyer Flotilla based at Devonport. On 26 March 1942 Atherstone sailed from Falmouth as part of Operation Chariot, the St Nazaire Raid. This was an amphibious assault on the port of St Nazaire in France with the objective of destroying the gates of the Normandie dock by ramming them with an explosive- packed destroyer, , and so prevent the dock's use by the . Atherstone and her sister ship escorted Campbeltown and the remainder of the strike force, towing the Motor Gun Boat MGB 314 on the passage to St Nazaire. Early on 27 March, Tynedale sighted the , and the two escort destroyers attacked the U-boat. Although U-593 survived the attack, the destroyers forced the U-Boat to stay submerged for several hours, preventing it from interfering with the operation.Blair 2000, pp. 559‚Äì560. In May 1942 Atherstone transferred to the 16th Destroyer Flotilla, escorting convoys off the East coast of Britain. In March 1943 the ship transferred to the Mediterranean, joining the 18th Destroyer Flotilla. In July 1943, Atherstone took part in the Allied invasion of Sicily, forming part of the naval force supporting the landing of the British XXX Corps south-west of Syracuse.Rohwer and H√ºmmelchen 1992, p. 222. On 26 November 1943 she rescued about 70 survivors from the troopship , which had been sunk by a Henschel Hs 293 glide bomb off the coast of French Algeria. On 23 September 1945 Atherstone sailed from the Mediterranean to Portsmouth and was paid off into the reserve. In 1953 she was laid up at Cardiff.

Within the eastern Grand Canyon, it consists of thin, discontinuous and relatively inconspicuous lenses that fill paleovalleys cut into the underlying Muav Limestone. Within these paleovalleys, it at most, is only about thick at its maximum. Within the central and western Grand Canyon, the exposures are continuous. However, they tend to merge with cliffs of the much thicker and overlying Redwall Limestone.Billingsley, GH (2000) Geologic Map of the Grand Canyon 30‚Äô X 60‚Äô Quadrangle, Coconino and Mohave Counties, Northwestern Arizona.

Within the western and central parts of the Grand Canyon, the Temple Butte Formation consists of a westward thickening layer of interbedded dolomite, sandy dolomite, sandstone, mudstone, and limestone that vary in color from purple, reddish-purple, dark gray, to light- gray. Within the eastern part of the Grand Canyon, the Temple Butte Formation fills shallow paleovalleys, which are eroded into the underlying Tonto Group, (upper 3rd unit Muav Limestone). The Temple Butte strata filling these paleovalleys consist of interbedded mudstone, sandstone, dolomite, and conglomerate - that vary in color from purple, reddish-purple, to light gray. Typically, the paleovalley-fill consists of a distinct pale, reddish purple dolomite or sandy dolomite. These paleovalleys range in depth from as much as , to as shallow as . Contacts The upper and lower contacts of the Temple Butte Formation are major unconformities. Within the Grand Canyon region, its base is a major unconformity within the Paleozoic rock record. The time represented by this unconfomity spans about 100 million years, including part of Late Cambrian, all of Ordovician and Silurian, and most of Early and Middle Devonian time. The upper contact is a disconformity that typically consists of nearly horizontal surfaces with little or no relief and overlain locally by a basal conglomerate within the overlying Redwall Limestone. Frenchman Mountain Within the area of Frenchman Mountain, Clark County, Nevada, over of limestone and dolomite occupy the interval between the Muav and Redwall limestones, where in the Grand Canyon there exists less than of Temple Butte Formation.

The gate was part of a fort built by Mughal governor, Daud Khan Panni, in the first half of the 18th century. It was the site of a memorable defense made by Robert Clive during the Siege of Arcot. History Historically, the region had been the site of number of battles. This prompted the construction of the fortress around Arcot. The area was captured by a Mughal Nawab of Karnataka from the Marathas caste. Daud Khan Panni was made governor by Zulfikhar Ali Khan (Aurangzeb's general) in 1698. In the year 1710, Mohammed Sayyid was the last mughal governor who was appointed as Nawab of Karnatic with the title Saadatullah Khan I and moved his capital from Gingee to Arcot. The prolonged disputes between the different dynasties fighting for the control of Arcot led to the arrival of the British and the French. However the battle between British and French forces was only for control of south India. The capture and the defence of Arcot by handful of British troops and Sepoy under the command of Robert Clive against enormous forces was one of the most remarkable battles fought by the British. The siege lasted fifty days, ending 15 November 1751. The Arcot Fort was part of the famous Battle of Arcot, which led to a British victory. One of the gates of the fort was renamed \\"Delhi Gate\\" to signify the beginning of the capture of Delhi. The entrance of the gate was constructed in the style of a Mughal arch. Over the gate is Robert Clives room. The old red brick town walls which were part of the original fortification of Arcot were destroyed by Tippu Sultan in 1783, but the foundations can be still seen. Today, the remains of the tombs of Saadatullah Khan I and Jama Masjid are the silent witnesses to that period.

The bill would allow victims to give a preferences as to whether they would prefers their cases take place in the military or in the civilian justice systems. It also applies these changes to the military academies as well. It was passed by the United States Senate during the 113th United States Congress. Background The Senate worked on and rejected another bill related to sexual assault in the military, written by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, the previous week. S. 1917 is considered less controversial than the bill previously rejected, although they were intended to address the same issue. Gillibrand's bill was controversial because it took the decision about prosecuting sexual assaults away from the military chain of command. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Victims Protection Act of 2014 would amend the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 (NDAA 2014) to revise the sexual assault prevention and response program activities of the Armed Forces. In section two, the bill would amend NDAA 2014 to include the senior trial counsel detailed to a case involving sex-related charges in the process for determining whether such charges should be referred for a court-martial (currently, such determination is made solely by the staff judge advocate). Section three would require the Special Victims' Counsel, in cases involving sexual assaults in the military, to provide advice to assault victims on the advantages and disadvantages of prosecuting such assaults by court-martial or in a civilian court. Requires the Secretaries of the military departments to: (1) establish a process to ensure consultation with the victim of a sexual assault to determine such victim's preference for prosecuting such assault either by court-martial or in a civilian court, and (2) afford great weight to such preference in determining which court shall prosecute the offense. Requires notification to a victim who expresses a preference for prosecution in a civilian court if a decision is made to decline prosecution or prosecute such offense by court-martial. The bill would require performance appraisals of: (1) officers and enlisted personnel of the Armed Forces to include an assessment of the extent to which such members support their respective sexual assault prevention and response programs, and (2) a commanding officer to indicate the extent to which such officer has established a command climate in which allegations of sexual assault are properly managed and fairly evaluated and a victim can report criminal activity without fear of retaliation or ostracism. The bill would require the Secretaries of the military departments to establish a process for a command climate assessment and for a confidential challenge by an individual who was the victim of a sexual assault of the terms or characterization of such individual's discharge or separation from the Armed Forces. The bill would require a modification of the Military Rules of Evidence to clarify that evidence of the general military character of an individual accused of a criminal offense (good soldier defense) shall not be admissible for the purpose of showing the probability of innocence of such individual, unless such evidence is relevant to an element of the offense for which the accused has been charged. Section four would require the Secretary of the military department concerned to ensure that provisions of NDAA 2014 relating to sexual assault prevention and response apply to the U.S. Military Academy, the Naval Academy, and the Air Force Academy. Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to ensure that such provisions apply to the Coast Guard Academy. Section five would require the Secretary of Defense (DOD) and the Attorney General to jointly develop a strategic framework for collaboration between DOD and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to prevent and respond to cases of sexual assault and report to the Armed Services and Judiciary Committees of Congress on such framework. Requires such framework to be based on and to include: (1) an assessment of the role of DOD in investigations and prosecutions of sexual assault cases in which DOD and DOJ have concurrent jurisdiction; (2) an assessment of the feasibility of establishing the position of advisor on military sexual assaults within DOJ and provide DOD investigative and other assistance in sexual assault cases on domestic and overseas military installations; (3) an assessment of the number of unsolved sexual assault cases; (4) a strategy to leverage efforts by DOD and DOJ to improve the quality of investigations, prosecutions, specialized training, services to victims, awareness, and prevention and to address social conditions that relate to sexual assault; and (5) mechanisms to promote information sharing and best practices between DOD and DOJ. Section six would advance from 120 to 60 days after the enactment of NDAA 2014 the due date for the report of the DOD Secretary on a proposed punitive article under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for violations of prohibitions against inappropriate contact with prospective and new members of the Armed Forces. Section seven would express the sense of the Senate that: (1) the panel to review and assess the systems used to respond to sexual assault established by NDAA 2014 is conducting an independent assessment of the systems used to investigate, prosecute, and adjudicate crimes involving adult sexual assault and related offenses; (2) the work of such panel will be critical in informing the efforts of Congress to combat rape, sexual assault, and other sex-related crimes in the Armed Forces; (3) the panel should include in its assessment a review of the reforms that will be enacted by NDAA 2014; and (4) the views of the victim advocate community should continue to be well-represented on the panel. Procedural history The Victims Protection Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States Senate on January 14, 2014 by Sen. Claire McCaskill (D, MO). On March 10, 2014, the Senate voted in Roll Call Vote 62 to pass the bill 97-0. The United States House of Representatives received the bill on March 11, 2014 and referred it to the United States House Committee on Armed Services, the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. Debate and discussion Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) spoke out in favor of the bill saying it has \\"important new protections.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Courts-martial in the United States Notes/References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas S. 1917 *beta.congress.gov S. 1917 *GovTrack.us S. 1917 *OpenCongress.org S. 1917 *WashingtonWatch.com S. 1917 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"Victims Protection Act of 2014"},{"id":"42203242","text":"Aaron March (born 14 May 1986, in Brixen) is an Italian alpine snowboarder.

It was released online on January 1, 2002, via frontman Kevin McMahon's own record label, Lucky Pierre Music. The album was produced by McMahon and British record producer Warne Livesey, who produced Prick's self-titled 1995 debut album. The production of the album was rejected by Prick's previous record labels Nothing/Interscope Records due to creative differences and the labels' commercial expectations. It has sold 3,000 copies. At the same year of its release, McMahon has assembled a new line-up for Prick, which featured guitarist Greg Zydyk, former Lucky Pierre bassist Tom Lash and former Stabbing Westward drummer Andy Kubiszewski. The band toured in between 2002 and 2003 to promote the album. Background After supporting David Bowie and Nine Inch Nails' Outside Tour in 1995, Prick entered a hiatus. In 1996, Kevin McMahon played guitar alongside Nine Inch Nails on Nights of Nothing tour and performed Prick tracks with them. After 1996, he relocated in London to record the new Prick album and recorded demos with Prick drummer Garrett Hammond. Nevertheless, in the wake of the recording sessions, Nine Inch Nails manager John Malm, Jr. told McMahon that Interscope Records wasn't going to support the production of new album, as the label wanted more commercial and radio- friendly songs. This was contested by McMahon, who refused to conform to the record company. This eventually caused a fallout between McMahon and Nothing Records. In an inverview with The Plain Dealer in 2002, he stated: McMahon independently worked on the demos, with the aid of Hammond and British producer Warne Livesey, who produced Prick's self-titled debut album. In 1999, he managed to get the rights for his songs back from Interscope. Then he started working on the publishing arrangements, which he described as \\"a long death.\\" In the winter of 2000 and 2001, two tracks, \\"Wet Cat\\" and \\"I Know It's Going to Hurt\\" were posted online. These were followed by the online release of the album. Critical reception Annie Zaleski of The Phoenix gave the album a positive review, stating: \\" Like Reznor‚Äôs ambitiously experimental Nine Inch Nails disc The Fragile (nothing/Interscope), The Wreckard forgoes radio-friendly industrial rock for severely twisted sonic foundations and a radical cut-and-paste √¶sthetic.\\" She also wrote: \\"On the easier-listening side, McMahon balances the noise storms with artfully Bowie-esque pop songs.\\" Track listing All songs written by Kevin McMahon. # \\"Three Rings\\" ‚Äì 3:45 # \\"Wet Cat\\" ‚Äì 3:06 # \\"Into My Arms\\" ‚Äì 3:37 # \\"I Know It's Gonna Hurt\\" ‚Äì 2:03 # \\"Godfather\\" ‚Äì 3:48 # \\"Object\\" ‚Äì 2:45 # \\"Actress\\" ‚Äì 2:21 # \\"House Husband\\" ‚Äì 4:15 # \\"Without It\\" ‚Äì 2:45 # \\"My Analyst Says\\" ‚Äì 4:17 # \\"Darling Dead\\" ‚Äì 2:42 # \\"Humanerace\\" ‚Äì 3:20 # \\"Tomorrow\\" ‚Äì 4:06 # \\"Universe\\" ‚Äì 3:57 Personnel ;Prick *Kevin McMahon ‚Äì vocals, production, engineering, mixing (3-5, 7, 10-11, 13-14); recording (10, 14); guitar (1-13); bass (1-2, 4-12); keyboards (1-13); drum programming (1-2, 4-6, 8-11); piano (14); noises (14) *Garrett Hammond ‚Äì guitar (1, 7, 9); bass (1, 4, 7); drums (1, 4, 7, 9, 14); drum programming (1); percussion (6); sampler (6); noises (14); backing vocals (1, 7, 9, 14); mixing (1, 4, 7-9, 14); recording (1, 4, 7, 9, 14) ;Additional musicians *John Guciardo ‚Äì guitar (10) *Gary King ‚Äì drums (3, 13) *Warne Livesey ‚Äì bass (3, 13); drum programming (3, 13); production (3, 13); mixing (3, 13); recording (3, 13) *Num Struggles ‚Äì guitar (6); drums (12); mixing (1-2, 6, 8-12); recording (1-2, 4-12) ;Other personnel *Greg Zydyk ‚Äì mastering; additional engineering (7) *Frank Vale ‚Äì mastering *Jim Bryant ‚Äì additional engineering (7) References Category:2002 albums Category:Prick (band) albums Category:Self-released albums ","title":"The Wreckard"},{"id":"42203324","text":"Grankullaviken and surroundings. Grankullaviken (or Grankullavik) is a shallow bay at the northern tip of √ñland, Sweden, located in B√∂da socken, Borgholm Municipality. The bay is almost completely enclosed by two headlands and a few small shoal islands (Stora grundet, Borren, and Lilla grundet). Grankullavik is also the name of a village on the bay. The lighthouse L√•nge Erik on the Stora grundet island is officially named √ñlands norra udde (√ñland's northernmost point), even though the western headland extends a bit further north than the island upon which it stands. The eastern headland is the site of the windswept forest and nature reserve Trollskogen. History Panoramic image of Grankullaviken from the lighthouse L√•nge Erik. In medieval times the bay was also referred to as √ñrehamn, and was probably important already in prehistoric times. This part of √ñland was an important landing point for merchants in northern Kalmar County, and much of the shipping toward Gotland passed through this area as well. The bay and its port were of paramount importance to the economy of Boda. In modern times; Grankullaviken was important for the shipping of timber. The three small shoal islands (Stora grundet, Borren, and Lilla grundet) have a history of human habitation as well. Stora grundet is the location of the lighthouse, and Lilla grundet is the site of a chapel dedicated to St. Olav and an abandoned cemetery. Records from the Link√∂ping diocese dating from 1515 mention a chapel Sancti Olaui in B√∂da, but there are no further details; it is likely that stones from the chapel were used in the construction of the lighthouse. =Harbor= Old wooden jetty of Nabbelund, for lumber transport and ferry service to Gotland. Lumber was shipped from Nabbelund (a village just below L√•nge Erik) into the 1950s, when the mill closed down. In 2007 the harbor was prepared for ferry service to Gotland; remains of the old pier were inventoried and preparations made for new infrastructure. Ferry service since 1959 was provided intermittently by the converted cargo ship Nordpol, sailing between Nabbelund and Gotland (Klintehamn or Visby). The marina and fishing port of Grankullaviken at Nabbelund became defunct in March 2008. After a collision in Nynashamn between two ferries operated by Destination Gotland in July 2009, the ferry service established in 2007 ended in July 23, 2009. Fishing Grankullaviken's sheltered location is attractive to fishermen who fish mainly for pike, bass, and trout, besides garfish, flatfish, sik, and ide.

It is the result of decoding wire and transport protocols containing the bi-directional data payload. More precisely, wire data is the information that is communicated in each layer of the OSI model (Layer 1 not being included because those protocols are used to establish connections and do not communicate information).  Relevance  Wire data is the observed behavior and communication between networked elements which is an important source of information used by IT operations staff to troubleshoot performance issues, create activity baselines, detect anomalous activity, investigate security incidents, and discover IT assets and their dependencies. According to a March 2016 research note from American IT research and advisory firm Gartner, wire data will play a more important role than machine data for analytics in the future: \\"While log data will certainly have a role in future monitoring and analytics, it is wire data‚Äîradically rethought and used in new ways‚Äîthat will prove to be the most critical source of data for availability and performance management over the next five years.\\" Real-time wire data streams are also important sources of data for business and operational intelligence teams. In these types of scenarios, wire data is used to measure order transactions for real-time reporting on transaction volume, success, and failure rates; tracking patient admission rates at hospitals; as well as reporting on the weights and measures of airplanes prior to take-off.  Distinction between wire data and system self-reported data  Wire data is distinct from machine- generated data, which is system self-reported information typically in the form of logs sourced from elements like network routers, servers, and other equipment. Unlike those forms of machine-generated data, which are dependent on the logging configurations of those devices, wire data is defined by wire and transport protocols. There is a small amount of overlap between wire data and machine-generated data but also significant differences. For example, web server logs typically record HTTP status code 200 responses, indicating that a web page was served to a client. However, web servers do not log the transaction payload and so would not be able to show which HTTP status code 200 responses were for pages with a ‚Äúservice unavailable‚Äù message. That information is contained in the wire data or transaction payload and is not logged by the server.  Examples of information derived from wire data  * Structured transactional data passed over HTTP, including information encoded using SOAP/XML * SQL transaction details, such as errors, methods used, and stored procedures executed * Unique customer IDs, handset type, and credit- control details defined by AVPs and Commands contained in Diameter transactions * Cross-tier (web, database, storage, etc.) transaction metrics parsed by unique session IDs or other GUID * Correlation of network transfer time and server processing time * TCP mechanisms such as Nagle delays and throttling * HTTP metadata including user-agent, session ID, status code, and IP address * HTTP page content including page title, user ID, and transaction values  Methods of analyzing wire data  Traditional methods of capturing and analyzing wire data include offline network packet analyzers. Newer approaches receive a copy of network traffic from a port mirror (SPAN) or network tap and reassemble those packets into full per-client sessions and transaction streams, analyzing the entire transaction payload in real time and generating metadata on those transactions without storing the actual packets.

Due to natural gas‚Äô cleaner burning properties, the use of natural gas in merchant ship propulsion plants is becoming an option for companies in order to comply with IMO and MARPOL environmental regulations. The natural gas is stored in liquid state (LNG) and the boil-off gas is routed to and burned in dual fuel engines. Shipping companies have been cautious when choosing a propulsion system for their fleets. The steam turbine system has been the main choice as the prime mover on LNG carriers over the last several decades. The decades-old system on steam propelled LNG carriers uses BOG (boil-off gas). LNG carriers are heavily insulated to keep the LNG at around -160 ¬∞C ‚Äì to keep it liquefied. What happens is that even with all the insulation, the LNG containment area is penetrated by heat which allows for naturally generated boil-off gas (BOG). LNG engined oil / chemical tanker Tern Ocean on the Firth of Clyde  History  LNG shipping first became a possibility in 1959 when the Methane Pioneer, a converted WWII freighter safely transported Liquefied Natural Gas into the United Kingdom. After proving that LNG can be safely transported across the ocean, the LNG shipping industry boomed and now employs 200 billion dollars annually in capital. Since the start of the LNG industry in 1964, international trade has increased 50 times over, production capacity has increased 10 times over, and individual ship capacity has increased 5 times over. The LNG tanker design was initially created by Worm's and Co. This design is now referred to as the Gaz Transport Design. The tanks were initially created to hold 34,000 cubic meters, but the design has transformed into 71,500 cubic meters. Spherical LNG tanks showed up in 1973, when Hoegh built the Norman Lady. Spherical tanks are common among modern LNG vessels. In 1999, Samsung Heavy Ind. created the largest New Membrane-type LNG carrier of its time. She was the largest single hull vessel of her time, with a length of 278.8 meters, and the capability of 20.7 knots. The Arctic Princess, delivered in 2006, was the largest LNG tanker ever created. She is 288 meters long, and has a capacity of 147,000 cubic meters. Since 2006 capacities have continued to climb. New build LNG vessels delivered to customers in 2018 are often designed to fit through the expanded Panama Canal (neopanamax) and have 170,000 cubic meter capacities. At least one ship builder claims a 200,000 cubic meter neopanamax LNG vessel is possible https://www.gastechevent.com/sites/default/files/D2_T2_Johan%20Petter- Tutturen-Odin%20Kwon_DSME.pdf Boil-off gas The natural gas that fuels dual fuel engines is carried on ships as a boiling liquid, and transported at slightly higher than atmospheric pressure. When tank insulation is penetrated by any influx in heat, it will cause the temperature of the liquefied natural gas to rise, which allows for vaporization from liquid to gas. When heat penetrates the tank, the tank's pressure increases due to boil-off. The insulation of the tanks is designed with the most advanced technology. Even still, the insulation of the tanks is penetrated by heat. The boil-off occurs during the ships voyage. During a storm, the LNG cargo moves and sloshes around in the tanks. The boil-off gas represents 0.1% - 0.25% of the ships capacity per day. Tanks need to be maintained at a steady pressure. If the pressure in tanks is not controlled relief or safety valves are forced to open, venting the boil-off into the atmosphere until pressure is relieved. At this point, it has been proven that on board LNG re-liquefaction is uneconomical for most ships. Instead, the gas produced by this boil-off effect is routed to the ship's propulsion system and used as fuel for power plants such as steam boilers and dual fuel marine diesel engines. This reduces the use of bunker fuel, reducing fuel costs and equipment maintenance costs.Tusiani, M. D., & Shearer, G. (2007). LNG: A nontechnical guide. Tulsa, Okla: PennWell.  Technology  Samsung's Supreme was a Mark-III type LNG container ship that was the largest of its kind. The Supreme had the newest technology seen in LNG ships. She features tanks completely surrounded by double bottom hull, and a cofferdam between tanks. Each tank stores its cargo at -163 degrees Celsius. This is a standard storage temperature for LNG This is accomplished by 250 mm of insulation, and a 1.2 mm thick stainless steel membrane. Each cargo tank has submerged centrifugal pumps to unload cargo rapidly. This is the standard unloading method for LNG tanks. The maximum drought for LNG ships is typically 12 meters. This is due to harbor facilities sizes and restrictions. The most common size of LNG vessels ranges between 120,000 and 180,000 cubic meters because of ship dimensions. (Propulsion Trends in LNG Carriers Two-stroke Engines, 2017). The two common types of LNG carriers are Moss and Membrane. Moss type carriers feature spherical tanks to hold LNG, while Membrane style carriers feature more traditional rectangular style tanks with a stainless-steel membrane. Membrane tankers are more common because they are smaller than moss ships for the same amount of LNG fuel carried, but they create more boil-off gas than Moss style ships. A study by MEC Intelligence found said that LNG will be the primary fuel source for all merchant ships within 40 years. Many companies have already begun looking at the process of switching their fleets over to LNG propulsion systems. LNG vessel propulsion systems typically come equipped with WHRs, because they can lead to reduced emissions, reduced fuel consumption, and better efficiency. Switching to LNG powered vessels is a complicated task for companies, but combines with modern Waste Heat Reduction systems (WHRs), LNG vessels can be more efficient than diesel or steam propelled vessels. Heat loss of standard combustion engine: Propulsion systems Most propulsion systems in LNG carriers use the BOG and liquid fuels. In a steam plant, the BOG is used to fire the boilers and produce steam. The steam drives the turbines and propels the ship. The advantage to this type is that when the LNG cargo tank pressure is elevated the excessive BOG is burned simultaneously with liquid fuel. If there isn't enough BOG, liquid fuel (heavy fuel oil or HFO) is used to keep the plant operating. An alternative to the steam turbine engine is the dual- fuel marine diesel engine. Commercial ship propulsion system manufacturers such as Finland's W√§rtsil√§ and Germany's MAN Diesel SE are producing large bore dual-fuel diesel engines. The MAN B&W; ME-GI Engines have extremely flexible fuel modes that range from 95% natural gas to 100% HFO and anywhere in between. A minimum of 5% HFO for pilot oil is required as these are compression ignition engines and natural gas is not self-combustible.MAN Diesel and Turbo. (2013, Feb 28). Flexible Dual Future - MAN B&W; ME-GI Engine [Video file]. Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MVdIQYonM Steam turbines are exclusively the primary moving source for LNG ships, even though 2-stroke diesel engines are more efficient. This is because the boil-off gas from LNG needs to be utilized. Cost benefits Recent research has been focused on using LNG for fuel on ships other than LNG tankers. These studies show that LNG stands out in terms of emissions reduction and reduced operational costs. Some economic incentives have been shown to be advantageous to running an LNG propulsion system. When certain systems such as waste heat recovery (using waste heat to do work rather than dissipate) are added to the power plant, significant savings can be observed. One study shows that an LNG engine with a WHR system saves money compared to a diesel engine with WHR. There is a higher initial investment cost but it is a cost efficient method and environmentally sound one. Environmental issues Natural gas consists mainly of methane, which has a much stronger greenhouse effect than CO2 ref: Global warming potential. Climate impacts of methane are due largely to methane leakage. For example, there is an issue called methane slip. Methane slip is when gas leaks unburned through the engine. Methane has a GWP(20) (20-year global warming potential) which is 86x higher than CO2. If methane slip is not controlled, environmental benefits to using natural gas are reduced and can cancel out the advantages over diesel or bunker fuel due to the high greenhouse effect of the methane. Another challenge is hazards associated with the LNG being stored at very low temperatures. Insulation of the tank is critical, and there's possibilities of structural brittleness and personnel frostbite injuries. Essentially, since it is established that LNG for ship propulsion reduces CO2 and other pollutants compared to common heavy fuel oils, LNG implementation depends on these key factors: Gas availability, demand for ships, emission limits (emission controlled areas), LNG tank installation, and safety requirements. Challenges related to the use of LNG should be taken into consideration. Challenges such as the lack of infrastructure in the majority of commercial ports, crew's limited experience running engines with gas fuels, the future price of gas, and the required safety measures all are critical points to be considered. Use of LNG reduces Sulfur Oxides by nearly 100 percent, and it reduces Nitrogen Oxide emission by about 85 percent. There is considerable debate as to whether use of LNG results in reduced greenhouse gas emissions, with studies finding that methane leakage negates climate benefits.https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/24/natural-gas- leaks-methane-environmentBrandt, A.R.; Heath, G.A.; Kort, E.A; et al.

A crew of just over 100 sailors piloted under the North Pole. Nautilus was chosen for the mission because its nuclear reactor allowed it to remain submerged longer than a conventional submarine.

Russia celebrated the successful launch of their satellite into orbit in October 1957. Shortly after, the United States attempted to launch their Vanguard I satellite, which exploded before lifting off.Griffin, C. G. (2013). ‚ÄúOperation Sunshine‚Äù: The Rhetoric of a Cold War Technological Spectacle. Rhetoric & Public Affairs, 16(3), 521-542., Soviet researchers were ahead of their U.S. counterparts in rocket technology, and the American public was aware of this \\"gap\\". There was concern that the Soviet government would be able to use the same rockets that propelled Sputnik to launch nuclear-armed missiles at targets within the United States. President Eisenhower's aim was to speed the development of U.S. rocketry to keep pace with the better the Soviets', but also he had the responsibility of maintaining stability with the people. Eisenhower needed something to show Americans and the rest of the world that the U.S. government was ahead of the Soviets technologically. The chosen solution was to combine submarine technology and nuclear reactor technology ‚Äì two areas where U.S. science was ahead of the Soviets - in order to create a sort of technological showpiece and reinforce American public perception. Nautilus USS Nautilus was the first nuclear submarine built for the U.S. armed forces. It was designed by Admiral Hyman G. Rickover. Rickover ordered the hull of the boat built at Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut, while the reactor was built and tested in Idaho.Naval History and Heritage Command. Nautilus (SSN 571). Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships. Retrieved March 22, 2014 Nautilus departed from prior submarine design in that it was not designed to be a warship but rather as a symbol for peaceful nuclear energy. Mission It was not enough that the United States had just built a nuclear submarine, Nautilus had to be tested to show how much more advanced the technology was. Ideas were bounced around including Nautilus and the Skate (SSN-578) to complete a submerged lap around the Earth. It wasn't until William Anderson (Captain of Nautilus) suggested the submerged trip under the North Pole that it was even considered. Nautilus departed from Groton on August 19, 1957, for her first attempt at sailing under the Pole but it was unsuccessful because of the ice being too deep. Another attempt was not made until the next summer. On July 23, 1958, Nautilus left the Pearl Harbor naval base heading north towards the Bering Straight. She and her crew crossed under the pole at 2315 on August 3 and continued on for four more days until exiting from under the polar ice (Naval History) where Captain Anderson radioed to the President ‚ÄúNautilus 90 North‚Äù. Even the second attempt did not go without issues, the crew having to deal with large amounts of ice blockage as well as mechanical failures aboard the sub. The hope was that the mission was timed to where the ice levels in the Arctic would be at their lowest making it easier to navigate through the waters under the pole without hitting the bottom or the top with the periscope. The expedition was also used as a sort of testing ground for not only the sub but it was an opportunity for the Navy to experiment with different types of navigational equipment. Normally a ship or small craft relies on a magnetic compass which works by comparing your position to magnetic north. One major flaw with magnetic compasses is that magnetic north is not exactly on the North Pole but south of it so the crew was experimenting with a new design of the gyro-compass. As they inched farther north, the gyro- compass was much more reliable than the magnetic which pointed in nearly the opposite direction.

Gaston and the children stayed in the house, and both parents agreed to share custody. During the separation, conversations between Turcotte and Gaston were often spiteful. On February 8, 2009, Turcotte found out that \\"the children had been to the Carnaval de Qu√©bec with their mother and Huot. The Carnaval reportedly had special meaning to him since he had lived in Quebec City for many years.\\" Turcotte testified that \\"[a] hammer to the head would have hurt less.... I could not accept that Martin spent time with my children... as if I was being replaced\\". The next day, a former neighbour told Turcotte that the day he left, Huot had spent the night with his family and had been staying there almost every night for the previous two weeks. Turcotte said during his testimony that the information \\"made him flip\\". On February 10, 2009, he went to his family's residence to fetch his son's sweater and found Huot in the kitchen. Turcotte said, \\"You stole my wife. You betrayed me, you were my friend\\" and punched Huot in the face before leaving the house. On February 20, 2009, Turcotte drove by his old house, and Gaston ordered him to leave, telling him, \\"you are going to stop controlling my life... now, if I want to, I can change the children's names... I can get custody, I can move anywhere in Quebec.\\" Turcotte was terrified of losing his children. That day, while he was at work, colleagues noted \\"no outward signs\\" of distress. He had exchanged emails with Gaston and also picked up his children from daycare and school. He telephoned Gaston, who told him that she had changed the locks on the house and had consulted a lawyer. He was deeply hurt and took this as an \\"attack.\\" He replied that if she wanted war, she was going to get it. That night, Turcotte felt dejected and began to cry. After putting the children to bed, he read dated emails from Gaston which further hurt and disheartened him. He wanted to end his life and searched the Internet for techniques to commit suicide.  The murders  \\"On the morning of February 21, 2009, two police officers followed up on a call placed to 911 after the respondent had expressed suicidal thoughts to his mother. When they entered the respondent's home, the officers discovered the inert bodies of two children, a boy and a girl.\\" \\"Turcotte was under his bed, covered in vomit and blood. He told police he'd drunk windshield wiper fluid and wanted to die\\". In his testimony Turcotte recalled disordered scenes of the event: \\"He is standing in his son's room. He has a knife in his hands and stabs his son. His son cries out \\"no\\" and moves away. He realizes that he is hurting him. He panics and [translation] 'stabs him more'. He has a similar memory with respect to his daughter. He sees himself in the bathroom. He drinks windshield washer fluid. He has blood on his hands. He has hurt his children and looks for the knife to [translation] 'stab himself in the heart', but cannot find it\\". First trial Turcotte portrayed himself and Gaston as professionals dealing with the stress of raising children and dealing with life. He was charged with two counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of his two children. The trial began on April 12, 2011, and on July 5, the jury rendered a verdict of not criminally responsible due to mental disorder (adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressive moods). The prosecution successfully appealed the verdict on grounds that the trial judge, the Honourable Mr. Justice Marc David, of the Superior Court, District of Terrebonne, had erred in law, mainly with respect to the issue of self-induced methanol intoxication in conjunction with a mental disorder. Psychiatric treatment and second trial In 2012, Turcotte said that he was better than he was before the brutal stabbings in February 2009; he felt less shame, less guilt, had more self-esteem, and was ready to be released. Testifying before a mental health review board to determine whether to keep Turcotte another year at the Institut Philippe-Pinel de Montr√©al or release him to the care of his family, Turcotte said he was not a danger to anyone. Turcotte's lawyer, Pierre Poupart, announced in 2014 that he wanted to go to the Supreme Court of Canada in an attempt to challenge the appeals court ruling. Quebec Superior Court Justice Marc David, who presided over the first trial, postponed the date-setting until April 4, 2014 and said any new trial would not take place before March 2015. After spending 46 months in psychiatric care before being deemed fit for release from a mental institution, Turcotte remained behind bars awaiting trial. On September 12, 2014, he was released on a $100,000 bail, and a new trial was scheduled for September 2015. In December 2015, Turcotte was found guilty of second-degree murder of his two children. On January 15, 2016, he was sentenced to life in prison, with 17 years before he can be eligible for parole. Short Film In 2014, Canadian director Chloe Bellande released a seventeen-minute short-film entitled Will of Fortune, which was inspired by the murder trials of Turcotte and a woman, Susan Wright, who had stabbed her husband nearly 200 times and buried his body in their back yard in Houston, Texas. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2014.

Sails used to be the primary means of propelling ships, but with the advent of the steam engine and the diesel engine, sails came to be used for recreational sailing only. In recent years with increasing fuel costs and an increased focus on reducing emissions, there has been increased interest in harnessing the power of the wind to propel commercial ships.  Design  The mechanical means of converting the kinetic energy of the wind into thrust for a ship is the subject of much recent study. Where early ships designed primarily for sailing were designed around the sails that propelled them, commercial ships are now designed largely around the cargo that they carry, requiring a large clear deck and minimal overhead rigging in order to facilitate cargo handling. Another design consideration in designing a sail propulsion system for a commercial ship is that in order for it to be economically advantageous it cannot require a significantly larger crew to operate and it cannot compromise the stability of the ship. Taking into account these design criteria, three main concepts have emerged as the leading designs for wind-assisted propulsion: the ‚ÄúWing Sail Concept,‚Äù the ‚ÄúKite Sail,‚Äù and the ‚ÄúFlettner Rotor.‚Äù =Wing sail concept= As a result of rising oil prices in the 1980s the US government commissioned a study on the economic feasibility of using wind assisted propulsion to reduce the fuel consumption of ships in the US Merchant Marine. This study considered five different designs and concluded that with current technology the design that offered the greatest benefit would be the ‚ÄúWing Sail Concept.‚Äù The \\"Wing Sail Concept\\" would largely be an automated system of large rectangular solid sails supported by cylindrical masts. These would be symmetrical sails which would allow a minimal amount of handling to maintain the sail orientation for different wind angles, however this design was at the expense of increased efficiency. A small freighter was outfitted with this system to evaluate its actual fuel gains with the result that it was estimated to save between 15‚Äì25% of the vessel's fuel. Despite the positive findings of this study, the \\"Wing Sail Concept\\" failed to catch on and is not currently found on any commercial ships.Bergeson, Lloyd. (1981). Wind Propulsion for Ships of the American Merchant Marine. Springfield, VA: National Technical Information Service. =Kite sail= The kite sail concept has recently received a lot of interest. This rig consists of flying a gigantic kite from the bow of a ship using the traction developed by the kite to assist in pulling the ship through the water. Other concepts that have been explored were designed to have the kite rig alternately pull out and retract on a reel driving a generator. The kite used in this setup is similar to the kites used by recreational kiteboarders on a much larger scale. This design also allows users to expand its scale by flying multiple kites in a stacked arrangement. The idea of using kites is currently the most popular form of wind-assisted propulsion on commercial ships, largely due to the low cost of retrofitting the system to existing ships with minimal interference with existing structures. This system also allows a large amount of automation using computer controls to determine the ideal kite angle and position. Using a kite allows the capture of wind at greater altitudes where wind speed is higher and more consistent.Rizzuto, E. (2012). Sustainable Maritime Transportation and Exploitation of Sea Resources. London, UK: CRC Press This system has seen use on several ships recently with the most notable being , a merchant ship chartered by the US Military Sealift Command to evaluate the claims of efficiency and the feasibility of fitting this system to other ships.Konrad, John. (2009, April). Mariners Weather Log Vol.53 No. 1. Retrieved from U.S. Department of Commerce website: http://www.vos.noaa.gov/MWL/apr_09/skysails.shtml =Flettner Rotor= An early ship demonstrating the use of Flettner Rotors Diagram showing the operating principals of the Flettner Rotor The third design considered is the Flettner Rotor. This is a large cylinder mounted upright on a ship's deck and mechanically spun. The effect of this spinning area in contact with the wind flowing around it creates a thrust effect that is used to propel the ship. Flettner Rotors were invented in the 1920s and have seen limited use since then. In 2010 a 10,000 dwt cargo ship was equipped with four Flettner Rotors to evaluate their role in increasing fuel efficiency. Since then, several Cargo Ships and a passenger ferry have been equipped with rotors. Recent examples include : \\"Viking Line has installed a Norsepower rotor sail unit on the cruise ferry Viking Grace, making her the world's only working passenger vessel with a modernized Flettner rotor. \\" https://www.maritime- executive.com/article/viking-line-installs-rotor-sail-on-cruise-ferry \\"Energy Technologies Institute and Shell, Norsepower installed two of its rotor sails aboard the LR2 tanker Maersk Pelican in August 2018\\" https://www.maritime- executive.com/article/flettner-rotor-trial-delivers-real-world-fuel-savings Flensburg catamaran at the Kiel Week 2007 Maersk Pelican's are the largest Flettner rotors in the world, as of 2019 The only parameter of the Flettner Rotor requiring control is the speed of the rotor's rotation, so this method of wind propulsion requires very little operator input. In comparison to kite sails, Flettner rotors often offer considerable efficiency gains when compared to the size of a sail or kite vs. size of the rotor and prevailing wind conditions.Traut Michael. (2014, January). Propulsive power contribution of a kite and a Flettner rotor on selected shipping routes. Applied Energy, 113, 362‚Äì372. Rising trends The efficiency gains of these three propulsion assistance mechanisms are typically around 15‚Äì20% depending on the size of the sails. The main reason for the use of these mechanisms not being more widespread is mostly that shipping companies are unwilling to install untested equipment.Konrad, John. (2009, April).

She was one of the first women to pursue a professional career in sociology. Regarded today as a feminist pragmatist, MacLean is particularly remembered for her pioneering work in participant observation, and for her rigorous application of her sociological findings to immediate social problems. She is particularly known for her studies of working and immigrant women. MacLean's work was strongly informed by her association with social reformers such as Jane Addams, as well as founding scholars of sociology such as Albion Small, Charles Henderson, and George Herbert Mead. Early life and education MacLean was born in St. Peters Bay, Prince Edward Island, and raised in Nova Scotia. Her father was a Baptist minister, and she received her preparatory education at the Baptist Acadia Seminary in Wolfville, Nova Scotia. She went on to study at Acadia University (then known as Acadia College), receiving her bachelor's degree in 1893 and her master's in 1894. She then emigrated to Illinois, hoping to study at the University of Chicago, which had recently been established. Her brother Haddon had moved to Chicago in 1892, and had described the city to her. However, due to the shortage of funds she first worked for two years at Shimer College (then known as the Mount Carroll Seminary). MacLean was the first woman to receive a master's degree in sociology (in 1897), and the second to receive a Ph.D. (in 1900), both from the University of Chicago. Her master's thesis was on \\"Factor Legislation for Women in the United States\\", laying the groundwork for a lifetime of work studying the conditions of working women. Her dissertation dealt with another lifelong theme, immigration, and was titled \\"The Acadian Element in the Population of Nova Scotia\\". A portion of the dissertation was published in 1900; the remainder appears to have been lost. Teaching and administrative career MacLean's teaching and administrative work began at Shimer College, then known as the Mount Carroll Seminary and located in Mount Carroll, Illinois. She worked at Shimer from 1894 to 1896, serving as instructor of Latin and lady principal, a position approximating the later role she served as Dean of Women. Her sister, Mildred, also worked at Shimer. The MacLean sisters remained in contact with the Shimer community into their retirement in the 1930s. As a woman, MacLean was largely excluded from conventional academic positions in her field. Unlike male students, she was not hired into the sociology department, even though she \\"far surpassed the productivity of her male peers\\". Her initial teaching posts after her graduate study were at Royal Victoria College in Montreal, where she taught from 1900 to 1901, and at Stetson University in Florida, where she taught sociology from 1901 to 1903. She taught correspondence courses in the University of Chicago's Home Study Department from 1903 to a few months before her death in 1934. In addition, she taught as a professor of sociology at Adelphi College from 1906 to 1916, and at the YWCA National Training School from 1903‚Äì1916. In the Home Study Department at the U of C, MacLean worked alongside other notable women sociologists, including Edith Abbott and Sophonisba Breckinridge. She taught courses on subjects including rural life, social technology, and immigration. In the course of her career as a correspondence-school professor, she taught 799 students. Sociological and writing career MacLean was a highly sophisticated methodologist, using a pragmatic blend of methods to address the specific practical questions at hand. Her techniques included participant observation, social surveys, and social worlds. MacLean's research career reached its peak with a 1907-1908 study that she supervised under the auspices of the YWCA, using a staff of twenty-nine women sociologists surveying 400 companies employing a total of 135,000 women in more than twenty cities. The study led to her pathbreaking work on women's employment, Wage-Earning Women (1910). Later life and legacy In the 1920s, ill health forced MacLean to retire from non- correspondence teaching. She died on May 1, 1934, at her home in Pasadena, California. She had been living there with her sister Mildred since 1925. MacLean's use of participant observation, well ahead of the time that this technique became mainstream, has earned her the title of \\"mother of ethnography\\", However, the accuracy of this name has been disputed by scholars of her work, who note much earlier ethnographic work by Harriet Martineau. MacLean's biographer Mary Jo Deegan has identified her as a predecessor to later work in case study research, contemporary critical ethnography, and feminist ethnography. MacLean's dedicated work as a correspondence educator, a relatively new phenomenon at the time, has also attracted contemporary attention.

Like other taxa in this family, Zoophthora species cause disease in insects and as such are considered entomopathogenic fungi. Like most entomopathogenic fungal taxa, Zoophthora has been studied largely in the context of biological control of insect pest species. However, recent research indicates that many fungal taxa that have historically been considered entomopathogenic (e.g., Zoophthora) may serve diverse ecological roles as free-living members of the rhizosphere, as endophytes of plant tissue, and as saprobes.  History  The genus Zoophthora was first formally described by Batko in 1964; however, in 1966 Batko divided Zoophthora into four sub-genera. In 1989 Humber promoted Batko's four sub-genera to a single genus: Zoophthora. Recent systematic research has yielded support for the monophyly of Zoophthora, as well as its distinctness at the generic level. Life cycle Zoophthora species parasitize insects, using their host's body as a source of nutrition and as a site for reproduction. In order to infect a potential insect host, fungal tissue (generally as uninucleate or coenocytic hypha) must first penetrate the insect's cuticle. Upon entering an insect's body, some Zoophthora species are able to lose their cell walls and exist as protoplasts; this phenomenon is common in many taxa in the Entomophthorales, and is believed to help the fungus evade its host's immune responses. Asexual reproduction in Zoophthora occurs through the production and forceful discharge of primary conidia. Once these conidia contact a suitable substrate, they can then either germinate into vegetative tissue (i.e., mycelium) or develop secondary conidia. Sexual reproduction in this taxon generally occurs through the conjugation of two gametangia, which results in the production of a thick-walled zygosporangium. As in other Zygomycete fungi, the zygosporangia of Zoophthora serve as the site where zygospores mature and germinate into vegetative tissue.  Ecology  Interactions with Arthropods Perhaps the most studied aspect of Zoophthora species‚Äô ecology pertains to their interactions with arthropods. Zoophthora species are parasites that digest their hosts‚Äô tissues for nutrition. Fungi in this taxon also use the host's body as a substrate on which to reproduce. During this process of infection, digestion, and reproduction, the host is generally killed and as such these interactions between fungus and insect are best described as antagonistic. Because research on Zoophthora has historically been in the context of biological control of insect pests, the relative contributions of species in this genus to ecosystem functioning have been unexplored. As such, the extent of Zoophthora species‚Äô contributions in controlling insect populations in natural ecosystems is poorly understood. Interactions outside of Arthropods While ecological interactions outside of arthropod hosts have been explored in a handful of entomopathogenic fungal taxa, the roles of Zoophthora species in soils, plants, and other environments need to be explored.  Methods for isolation and identification  Isolation While approaches to isolating pure cultures of Zoophthora and other entomopathogenic fungal taxa vary, two general approaches are widely used: direct and indirect sampling. * Direct sampling: In direct sampling methods, fungal tissue (generally as conidia, and sometimes as hyphal bodies or protoplasts) is removed from infected arthropod hosts. This tissue is generally subcultured on a nutrient-rich medium, such as Sabouraud's Dextrose Agar or Potato Dextrose Agar. These media are frequently supplemented with egg yolk. * Indirect sampling: In indirect sampling methods, fungal tissue is isolated from indirect sources, such as soil or plant material. Approaches to indirect sampling vary, but many methods use whole insects or insect tissues as ‚Äúbait‚Äù. When fungal propagules from an environmental sample infect the ‚Äúbait‚Äù organism, the infected insect can be surface-sterilized, placed in conditions favorable for fungal growth, and monitored for the emergence of fungal propagules from host parts. In some cases, indirect sampling methods can be used when using direct sampling poses logistical concerns. In these instances, indirect sampling approaches can be used to prompt fungal tissue to spread from host tissue to another substrate, where propagules (e.g., conidia) can be isolated more easily. Identification Historically, the nuclear status and morphology of the cells comprising conidiophores in Zoophthora have been used to distinguish this taxon from other genera. Species-level distinctions are difficult to make between members of this genus using morphology alone, but the presence/absence and morphology of the characters listed below have been used to distinguish Zoophthora species with some success: * Conidiophores * Primary conidia * Secondary conidia * Resting spores * Hyphal bodies * Rhizoids * Nuclei With the advent of the use of molecular markers in inferring phylogenetic information, it is likely that estimates of species-level diversity in Zoophthora will become clearer as more research is conducted. Especially promising are approaches to species identification that do not require the isolation and cultivation of fungal tissue from the environment, such as pyrosequencing. Such cultivation-independent approaches to species identification are advantageous because they allow for the identification of taxa that are difficult or impossible to cultivate in the laboratory. Cultivation-independent approaches to species identification can also save time and materials, and can allow morphologically indistinguishable taxa to be differentiated.

He was the ruler of Panjikant and its surroundings from ca. 706 until his downfall and execution in the autumn of 722.  Origin  Divashtich was the son of a certain Yodkhsetak, who belonged to a noble Sogdian dehqan family from Samarkand, which could trace its descent back to the Sasanian king Bahram V Gur (r. 420‚Äì438). The family bore the title of sur and began ruling parts of Sogdia during the 6th century. There were five members of the family bearing the title of sur, Divashtich being the last of them.  Dispute with Samarkand and the Arabs  In ca. 706, Divashtich was elected as king of Panjikant, succeeding the Turkic prince Chukin Chur Bilga as the ruler of city. However, Divashtich did not held absolute power, but shared his power with other princes. Although Divashtich only ruled Panjikant, he claimed the title of \\"Sogdian king\\", and \\"ruler of Samarkand\\". Some of Divashtich's coins included the name of a certain Nana, which either was the goddess Nanaya, or Chukin Chur Bilga's daughter, whom Divashtich may have been married to. In 709/710, Tarkhun, the Sogdian ruler of Samarkand, was overthrown by a rebellion because of his pro-Muslim policy, and was succeeded by another Sogdian prince named Gurak. After the fall of Tarkhun, his two sons fled to the court of Divashtich, where they were treated honorably. This made Divashtich's claim to Samarkand much stronger. In ca. 712, Divashtich, including other local Sogdian rulers such as Gurak, acknowledged the authority of the Umayyad Caliphate after an invasion by the Arab general Qutayba ibn Muslim. While Gurak tried to break from Umayyad suzerainty and request aid from the Tang Dynasty, Divashtich remained loyal to the Arabs, and his relations seems to have been so great with them that he was even considered a Muslim. In 719, he was forced to send the two sons of Tarkhun to al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah, the Umayyad governor of Khorasan. As late as 721, Divashtich was in correspondence with Abd al-Rahman ibn Nu'aym al-Ghamidi, the new governor of Khorasan, who flatteringly addressed him as King of Sogdia and ruler of Samarkand, possibly trying to assure or win back his loyalty.Yakubovich 2002  Rebellion and death  Map of Khorasan, Transoxiana and Tokharistan In 720, Divashtich, along with another Sogdian ruler named Karzanj, are mentioned as the leaders of an anti-Arab rebellion in Sogdia. They managed to earn the allegiance of at-Tar, the Sogdian ruler of Farghana, who promised to give them protection in case their rebellion turned into a failure. While the army of Karzanj was staying at Khujand, at-Tar betrayed him, and told the Umayyad general Sa'id ibn Amr al-Harashi where Karzanj and his army was stationing. Al-Harashi quickly marched towards Khujand, where he defeated the army of Karzanj, brutally massacring over 3,000 Sogdian inhabitants in the city. Al- Harashi then left for Zarafshan, the location of Divashtich. A battle shortly took place near the city in 722, where al-Harashi managed to emerge victorious once again. Divashtich then fled to a fortress near Zarafshan, but eventually agreed to surrender to Arabs, and was taken prisoner, where he was treated well. The Arabs then began burning several houses and a temple in Panjikant. The Umayyad governor of Iraq, including other high officials, wanted to set Divashtich free. Al-Harashi, however, had Divashtich crucified on a Zoroastrian burial building, and sent his head to Iraq. This choice later played a role of al-Harashi's removal as the governor of Khorasan.  Religion  Although Buddhism and Manichaeism had spread around Sogdia, Divashtich, including the majority his subjects, were practicing Zoroastrianism, which was, however, different from the one practiced in the Iranian plateau. The Zoroastrianism worshipped by Divashtich and his subjects, also known as \\"Sogdian Zoroastrianism\\", was a different Zoroastrian sect which had received influence from different religions. Even ancient Mesopotamian religions had influenced the Zoroastrian sect, and gods such as Nanaya were worshipped by the Sogdians., \\"Panjikant\\"  Descendants  Divashtich's son Tarkhun (not to be confused with the Sogdian ruler Tarkhun) was taken as a prisoner of war in Iraq. Where his family lived for three generations. In the fourth generation, a member of the family named Mikal ibn Abd al-Wahid, settled in Khorasan at the beginning of the 9th century, where his descendants continued to live, marking the start of the prominent Mikalid family, which served various dynasties of Khorasan.

Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, in its 25006 Economic Census, reported that there were approximately 246 medium-sized food processing industries employing 19 percent of the industrial manufacturing workforce in Bangladesh or 8 percent of the total manufacturing labor force. The food industry employs 2.45 percent of the country's total labor force and its share in the GDP was 2.01 percent in 2010. There are also numerous small scale factories and domestic units engaged in food processing throughout the country. According to some industry analysts, the food processing sector in Bangladesh is a 4.5 billion US Dollar industry. In 2010, Bangladesh exported over $700 million worth of processed food and beverages, over 60 percent of them were shrimp and fish products. Food processing in Bangladesh has traditionally been small scale, with domestic or family business using common processing knowledge for the conservation and handling of raw agricultural commodities to make them usable as food and feed. Although commercial scale food processing using modern technology especially for wheat and rice milling, mustard seed crushing and very limited bread and cookie manufacturing appeared during the 1960s, the growth of this sector did not gain momentum in terms of operational scale and quality until the 1980s. Recently the defining characteristics of the industry has been the processing of increasingly diverse products to meet the changing demands of the Bangladesh population. The major food processing sub-sectors in Bangladesh include dairy, edible oil, sugar, rice, wheat, fruit and vegetable, tea, poultry/beef, pulses and spices and fish processing industries.

Early life Elisabeth Schooling was born in Hendon, London in 1915. Career Un bar aux Folies Berg√®re, now in the Courtauld Institute of Art, London From 1928, Schooling studied with Marie Rambert, and she danced in Ballet Club's (which later became Ballet Rambert) first seasons. Her first solo role was as the Bride in a 1934 ballet entitled Mermaid, which was choreographed by Susan Salaman and Andr√©e Howard, using music by Ravel. Also in 1934, it was noticed that Schooling had a very similar appearance to the barmaid in √âdouard Manet‚Äôs painting Un bar aux Folies Berg√®re. Marie Rambert‚Äôs husband Ashley Dukes suggested there might be a ballet around the picture, also introducing can-can dancers. Bar aux Folies-Berg√®re was first performed on 15 May 1934 at the Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill, London. Although the role was created by Pearl Argyle, Schooling danced it subsequently.Rambert, Marie. Quicksilver: an autobiography. Papermac (Macmillan Publishers Ltd), London, 1983, p157. In 1938, her future husband Frank Staff did his first choreography for Ballet Rambert, in The Tartans, a new version of Frederick Ashton's ballet of the same name, for three dancers, being himself, Schooling and Walter Gore, with music by Boyce. In 1939, Staff created Czernyana which used Czerny's piano exercises as the basis for a series of dances which caricatured different ballet styles. Its success led to Czerny 2 in 1941. Schooling had solos in both. Czernyana, a compilation of the best of both ballets featured in the Rambert repertory for many years. Personal life Schooling finally married her fellow Ballet Rambert dancer Frank Staff in 1942, having appeared in his early choreographed works. She retired in 1948, and they had one son together, although the marriage was eventually dissolved. Schooling later married the Devon farmer, Michael Chaplin.

The system that was to become Cyclone Lusi was first noted as a tropical disturbance on 7 March, while it was located to the east of Fiji. Over the next three days the system moved towards the north-northeast and gradually developed further, before it was named Lusi, late on 9 March, after it had developed into a tropical cyclone. The system dissipated on 17 March. Meteorological history Early on 7 March 2014, the Fiji Meteorological Service reported that Tropical Disturbance 18F had developed about to the west of Nadi. The system was located within a marginally favourable environment for further development, which included low to moderate vertical wind shear and favourable sea surface temperatures. Over the next two days the system moved towards the north-northwest and slowly consolidated, as atmospheric convection wrapped into the system's low level circulation centre, before RSMC Nadi reported during 9 March that the system had developed into a tropical depression. During that day the system further consolidated as it affected Vanuatu and moved towards the north-northeast, before the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated warnings and designated the depression as Tropical Cyclone 18P later that day. RSMC Nadi subsequently named the system Lusi at around 23:00 UTC (11:00 FST), after it had developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Preparations and impact =Vanuatu= Late on 9 March, ahead of the depression being classified as a tropical cyclone and named Lusi, the Vanuatu Meteorology and Geo-Hazards Department issued tropical cyclone warnings for the Vanuatu provinces of Torba, Sanma, Penama and Malampa. The cyclone killed 10 people and impacted as many as 20,000 people, especially in Torba, Sanma, Penama, Malampa and Shefa Provinces. Many low- lying areas were flooded and more than 40 structures were damaged or destroyed. All provinces of the country reported damage to agriculture. =Fiji= On 11 March, a tropical cyclone alert was issued for parts of the Western Division, as Lusi approached the islands from the west. During the next day gale warnings were issued for the Western Division before they were cancelled later that day, as the system turned towards the south sooner than had been expected. As a result, Fiji was spared any direct effects from the cyclone, while the associated trough of low pressure affected the islands until 13 March. =New Zealand= During 9 March, MetService started to warn that a tropical weather system might affect New Zealand by the end of that week. Cyclone Lusi hit New Zealand shores on 13 March. In preparation for the event the New Zealand government advised people to fix loosened things (such as trampolines), and the Civil Defense team was put on alert. Winds reaching up to 130 km/h were expected to occur in the cities of Auckland, Whangarei and Hamilton, and the east coast of the North Island was put on high alert. Lusi brought severe winds as it moved southeast towards Wellington and the northern South Island in the evening of 15 March. On 16 March, the severe gale winds slightly weakened, and Lusi pushed away from New Zealand on 17 March. Insured losses across the country amounted to NZ$4 million (US$3 million). Retirement Due to the impacts caused by the storm, the name Lusi was retired and was later replaced by Louise.

Nash (May 27, 1936 ‚Äì March 10, 2006) was a philosophy professor at Reformed Theological Seminary. Nash served as a professor for over 40 years, teaching and writing in the areas of worldview, apologetics, ethics, theology, and history. He is known for his advocacy of Austrian economics, and his criticism of the evangelical left. Biography Ronald H. Nash was born in Cleveland, Ohio on May 27, 1936. In 1956, Nash received ordination. He pastored both Baptist and Presbyterian churches. He earned his Bachelor's degree at Barrington College, and a master's degree at Brown University, before going on to receive his Doctorate in Philosophy from Syracuse University in 1964. He did postdoctoral work at Stanford University in 1969.CV Following his doctoral work, Nash became the Chairman of the Department of Philosophy and Religion and Director of Graduate Studies in Humanities at Western Kentucky University, where he served for 27 years. In 1991, he became Professor of Philosophy and Theology at Reformed Theological Seminary, serving there until 2002. Additionally, Nash was Professor of Philosophy at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary from 1998‚Äì2005. From 1988‚Äì1991, Nash was an advisor to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission. In 1991 and 1992, he lectured in Moscow on the subject of God and economics. In 1998, Nash conducted a speaking tour of New Zealand. He was also an advisor for the DreamWorks Animation movie, The Prince of Egypt. He taught overseas classes, World Views in Hong Kong and Church History in London. Nash died on March 10, 2006, due to complications from a stroke. He was survived by his wife, Betty Jane, and children, Jeffrey and Jennifer. A public memorial service in Nash's honor was held at the Orlando campus of the Reformed Theological Seminary. Thought =Religious particularism= Nash was a proponent of religious particularism. He argued that one had to possess explicit belief in Jesus in order to obtain salvation. He argues that John 3:16‚Äì18 makes it explicit that all who believe in Jesus will be saved and all who fail to believe will not be saved. =Liberation theology= Nash was the editor of On Liberation Theology, as well as one of its contributors. In this book he argues that liberation theology consists of 3 claims. # Christians ought to become politically active on behalf of the poor and oppressed. # The major cause of poverty and oppression in the world is capitalism. # Christians should attack capitalism and see it replaced by socialism. Nash agrees with the first claim, but argues that attacking capitalism and seeing it replaced by socialism will achieve precisely the opposite goals sought out by liberation theologians, arguing that socialism as a means of liberation is both tragic and ironic. Liberation theologians have rejected the one system that offers real economic hope for the masses they wish to assist. Instead, they have taken a path that will not only deny their people food but also deprive them of liberty due to socialism's central control. According to Nash, when such a movement calls itself liberation theology, the label is truly ironic. =Socialism= Nash states that the majority of academics in his day had a strong bias against capitalism. People blamed capitalism for nearly every evil in contemporary society including greed, selfishness, materialism, fraudulent behavior, the debasement of society's tastes, the pollution of the environment, alienation, despair, and the vast disparities of wealth. Even racism and sexism are treated as effects of capitalism. Nash argued that criticisms of capitalism were really just slogans unsupported by anything resembling evidence. An undesirable feature is noted in an alleged capitalistic society, and one where a market economy supposedly functions. Then it is simply asserted that capitalism is the cause of this problem. This is known in logic as the fallacy of false cause. Mere coincidence does not prove a causal connection. Such critics of capitalism conveniently overlook the fact that the features of capitalist societies they find so offensive also exist in socialist societies. Socialism is an umbrella term, often referring to economies with centralized control. Nash argued that the main flaw in all forms of socialism has been recognized in the 1920s by Ludwig von Mises. Mises argued that a fully centrally controlled economy can never attune to what people want unless there is a free market. Without markets, there is no way of doing cost accounting. Without cost accounting, there is no way to determine whether a good's value is worth its cost of production. This results in chaos for the economy. The way that socialist countries have been able to avoid this collapse is through monitoring the pricing information in existing free markets, and then applying this information to set prices in their own economies. The great paradox of socialism is the fact that socialism needs capitalism in order to survive. Unless socialist economies allow for some free markets which provide the pricing information possible, socialist economies would soon collapse. Von Mises' claims were strengthened by the fact that this is exactly what happened in cases such as the Soviet Union, where socialist states attempted to abolish all markets. The result is that no socialism in practice can dispense with market exchanges. Consequently, socialism attacks the market at the same time it is forced to utilize the market process. =The mixed economy= Sometimes called interventionism, the mixed economy is a compromise or mix, between capitalism and socialism. Most countries that we identify as \\"capitalist\\" and \\"socialist\\" are really different degrees of a mixed economy. Nash argues that there can never be a sustainable mixed economy. Any economy that tries to mix socialism and capitalism will inevitably collapse into one of the two. =Christian left= Nash is a critic of the Christian left, particularly Jim Wallis, Ron Sider, and Tony Campolo. He argues that this group has good intentions for helping the poor, but flawed economic theory. He states that the criticisms generally leveled against capitalism are in fact criticisms of government intrusion into market activities. He argues that economic exchanges come in two varieties: by peaceful means and by violent means. The former can be stated as \\"if you do something good for me, I will do something good for you.\\" The latter can be stated as \\"if you do not do something good for me, I will do something bad for you.\\" Government intervention into the economy, such as by income taxes, are part of the latter system, and not the former. He states that socialism, by definition, cannot be voluntary, since under socialism, capital is either owned or controlled by the state. Nash states that the problem with this system is that it shuts off important signals that entrepreneurs might otherwise use in making economic decisions. When the government owns the land, labor, utilities, factory, and other factors of production, it becomes impossible to tell how much it costs to produce a good or service. The Soviet Union was able to function because it sent spies to capitalist nations to obtain pricing information. Capitalism, Nash argues, is not economic anarchy. He states that capitalism is a system of voluntary relationships which protect people's rights against force, fraud, theft, and violations of contract. Nash states that the Christian left argues that capitalism encourages greed. Nash retorts that capitalism is the one mechanism that neutralizes greed, as it forces people to find ways of serving the needs of those with whom they wish to exchange. As long as greedy people are prohibited from introducing force, fraud, and theft into the exchange process and as long as they cannot secure special privileges from the state under interventionist or socialist arrangements, their greed must be channeled into the discovery of products or services for which people are willing to trade. Jim Wallis Nash has criticized Jim Wallis for celebrating what Wallis called the American defeat in the Vietnam War. While Wallis identified as anti-war, Wallis criticized those who protested against the North Vietnamese military campaign and human rights violations. Nash writes \\"Wallis's response to the Cambodian Communists' slaughter of two million men, women, and children was to deny the bloodbath and blame whatever else might happen on the United States. Wallis, Nash argues, did the same for the Soviet Union, refusing to condemn the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, instead believing that America posed the greatest threat to world peace. Nash argued that despite claiming to be a moderate, Wallis actually holds a Marxist worldview, since Wallis argued in his document The Road To Damascus that anti-Communist Christians are members of the forces of darkness and should convert to Marxism. Ron Sider According to Nash, Ron Sider influenced the leadership of evangelical Christian colleges. One college president stated publicly that he would not hire any faculty for his school who were not in sympathy with Sider's position on Rich Christians in an Age of Hunger.

Nancy met Harold LeMay in the early 1960s, and they were married in 1963; between them they had eight children. One thing Nancy and Harold bonded over was their collections. This included hundreds of vintage cars, but also a great deal of Americana, from toys to signs to dental equipment. While Harold is often cited as the collector of the family, Nancy was just as passionate about it as him. She even got her commercial driver's license endorsement, in case it was needed for some of the larger vehicles in their collection. Harold and Nancy started the Annual LeMay Car Show in the late 1970s. Then, it was a small gathering of family friends. In the decades since then, Nancy has continued to host the show as it has grown into a much-anticipated annual event, drawing thousands of people each year. By 1998, the LeMay family collection was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the ‚ÄúLargest Antique & Vintage Vehicle Collection.\\" At that point, the collection held more than 1,900 vehicles. Harold lived just past his 81st birthday, dying in 2000.More information on the LeMay Family Collection By then, the couple‚Äôs collection was estimated to have over 3,000 cars. After Harold‚Äôs death, Nancy continued to build and maintain their collections. At one point, Harold had hoped to have a museum for his cars so that the public could view them and the collection wouldn‚Äôt be broken up after his death. For more than a decade, Nancy LeMay and her family worked to fundraise and build support to open the LeMay America's Car Museum in downtown Tacoma. Though cars from a number of collections are displayed, Nancy sits on the board for the museum and the LeMay family has donated hundreds of cars to America's Car Museum. The LeMay Family Collection Foundation is a non-profit started by Nancy LeMay and family in 2010. Directly owned and overseen by the family, this museum houses over 500 cars in 3 buildings and is open to the public for tours 6 days a week. This collection is housed at historic Marymount in Tacoma, Washington. Nancy has been active in the community in a variety of other ways; she donated $100,000 to Pierce County Parks and Recreation to build the Harold LeMay Skatepark at Sprinker Recreation Center. On May 28, 2011, Harold and Nancy LeMay were inducted into the Washington State Hot Rod Hall of Fame. In 2013, Nancy was a recipient of the Lee Iacocca Award, given to honor ‚Äúa person who, over time, has demonstrated an extraordinary dedication to the classic car hobby through vehicle preservation, club participation, and one who has unselfishly assisted and encouraged others in perpetuating an ‚ÄòAmerican Automotive Tradition.‚Äô‚Äù Quoted directly from the website.

He started as quarterback for the Texas Longhorns. He started the 1977 season as the 4th string quarterback on an unranked team and finished as the starter of the #1 team in the country, playing for the national championship. Early life Randy McEachern was an all-district quarterback and district MVP for the Pasadena Dobie High School football team, which he led to the district championship. He was also captain of the golf team and ran track. He wanted to go to play at TCU, where his father Bobby McEachern had quarterbacked from 1951-2. TCU was interested, but they wanted him to go to Junior College first and so he prepared to go to Navarro Junior College. But then, at the urging of then-Offensive Coordinator Fred Akers, the Longhorns offered him a scholarship and he chose to go to Texas instead. College career McEachern came to Texas as the heir apparent to All-American Marty Akins. But he didn't play in 1974 and redshirted in 1975. In the spring of 1976 he competed with Mike Cordaro for the backup position, but was lost for the season following a knee injury at the first fall scrimmage in August. In the spring of 1977, Coach Fred Akers moved him to defense as a fourth string safety, but McEachern begged to be left at quarterback and Akers relented. For there years, he never played a down. In fact, the year before the Oklahoma game that catapulted him into the role of starting quarterback, he had watched the game from the press box where he was a spotter for a radio network broadcast. McEachern started the 1977 season as the #4 quarterback on the depth chart and was not even listed in the team's media guide. Through Texas' first three wins he threw only 4 passes, as the Longhorns went from unranked to #5 in the country. Then came the Oklahoma game. Starting quarterback Mark McBath broke his ankle on the 7th play. Backup Jon Aune lasted only another nine before tearing ligaments in his knee, and preseason #3 quarterback Ted Constanzo had injured his knee playing racquetball in July. With all three players out with what appeared to be season-ending injuries, the ball was given to McEachern. Relying on eventual Heisman Trophy winner Earl Campbell, three-time All- American kicker Russell Erxleben and solid defense, McEachern and the Longhorns did just well enough to win 13-6. With McEachern under center - and Campbell in the backfield - Texas continued to win all season, including wins over #8 Arkansas and #14 Texas Tech. They rose to #1 in the rankings and stayed there for six weeks. In the Arkansas game, McEachern threw for 72 yards of a game-winning 80 yard touchdown drive late in the 4th quarter, and was named the Chevrolet Offensive Player of the Game. Late in the season, McEachern re-injured his knee in practice and Sam Ansley replaced him that week against TCU and the start of the next against Baylor. McEachern and Ansley alternated series in the second half against Baylor, and McEachern took over for the remainder of the season. That season, McEachern threw for 906 yards with 8 touchdowns and 4 interceptions, while rushing for 189 yards and 3 touchdowns.http://stats.texassports.com/sports/m-footbl/archive/stats/77/indgbg.htm#IGBG.PAS For only the fourth time in Texas history, the Longhorns finished the season ranked #1, undefeated and playing in the Cotton Bowl for the national championship. But McEachern fumbled the ball on the first drive setting up a Notre Dame field goal, and went on to throw three interceptions as Notre Dame rolled to an easy win and the national championship.http://media.attcottonbowl.com/resource/history/1978/rsrc/1978-Classic- Recap.pdf On the third day of the 1978 spring practice, McEachern reinjured the knee he'd had surgery on in 1976 and underwent surgery again. Coach Akers worried that it would keep him from playing, but by the fall, McEachern was again the starter. He struggled early and after a poor showing against Oklahoma was replaced by Donnie Little who got the start the next week against North Texas State. In that game McEachern came off the bench and threw two touchdown passes to rally Texas to a come-from-behind win and reclaim his starting position. He started the next 5 games, during which Texas upset #3 Arkansas but lost to #8 Houston and was upset by unranked Baylor. He shared some time with Little, and got to play against his brother Greg, who played defense for TCU. The Baylor game would, effectively, be the end of McEachern's career. In it, former starter Mark McBath took a significant number of snaps and, for reasons that Akers never stated, was given the start the next week against Texas A&M.; McBath also got the start in the 42-0 blowout win over Maryland in the Sun Bowl, a game in which McEachern played only sparingly, throwing 2 incomplete passes while rushing for -27 yards.http://stats.texassports.com/sports/m-footbl/archive/stats/78/ut-md.htm He finished his career at 11-4 as a starter. =Records= *Cotton Bowl - Most passes had intercepted, game (3), tied 6 others, surpassed by Joe Montana in 1979 *Cotton Bowl - Most passes had intercepted, career (3), tied 7 others, surpassed by Joe Montana in 1979 *UT-Highest average gain per attempt, season (10.2 yards) *UT-Highest average gain per attempt, career (8.5 yards) *UT- Highest average gain per completion, season (20.1 yards) *UT-Highest average gain per completion, career (18.4 yards) *UT-Touchdown passes, game (4), tied Clyde Littlefield, tied by Rick McIvor and Peter Gardere, surpassed by James Brown in 1994 Bold means active Later life McEachern married author, and former Texas cheerleader, Jenna Hays McEachern with whom he had two children.

Once a center for cotton production, Continental is now nearly surrounded by large pecan orchards and Green Valley subdivisions. It is also the closest town to Madera Canyon, a premier birdwatching area and tourist attraction located in the Santa Rita Mountains. History Continental was founded during World War I in 1916, after President Woodrow Wilson asked the Intercontinental Rubber Company of Bernard Baruch, Joseph Kennedy, and J. P. Morgan to grow guayule. Guayule is a plant that produces latex and can be used to make rubber if, as many Americans feared, the German navy were to cut off shipping lanes and imports of rubber from the Far East. In 1916, Intercontinental established the Continental Farm seven miles south of Sahuarita and immediately east of the present-day Green Valley, along the eastern banks of the Santa Cruz River and the Southern Pacific Railroad. Over the next few years, a small town was built to accommodate the workers at the farm. In addition to several large adobe homes that were built for the farmers around 1918, and the fields and the processing facility built for the guayule, the town of Continental had a post office that opened in 1917, a schoolhouse that was built in 1918, a church, a general store, and its own cemetery. The guayule project was abandoned after the end of World War I. In 1922, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands bought the farm and rented the fields to cotton farmers until 1949. In 1926, an Arkansas farmer named James B. Bull acquired a 160-acre plot in between Continental and Sahuraita. Naming it the Bull Farm, James raised alfalfa, vegetables, and grains until 1975. At its peak, Bull Farm was one of the largest in the area with its 6,150 acres. In 1939, the Bull Farm was used in the filming of The Westerner, starring Gary Cooper. During World War II, in late 1944, the United States Army established a prisoner of war camp for German POWs next to the farm. Camp Continental, as it was called, was built to house 250 inmates and forty guards. Because of a labor shortage caused by the war, the prisoners were put to work in the nearby fields. Although very little is known about the history of the camp, on more than one occasion the American guards had to use billy clubs to \\"quell disorderly prisoners as they were prone to pro-Nazi uprisings.\\" Nothing remains of the camp and in 1989 the site of the Bull Farm became the present- day Quail Creek retirement development center. In 1948, R. Keith Walden relocated his Farmers Investment Company (FICO) from California to Arizona and purchased the Continental Farm to use as his headquarters. In the 1950s, Keith grew concerned that competition from synthetic fibers would threaten the cotton market and in 1965 he transitioned his farming operation to pecans as an alternative crop. Keith chose pecans because of their compatibility with the climate of the Sonoran Desert. FICO is still owned by the Walden family and their orchards combine to form the largest pecan grove in the world. Today, several of the old adobe homes in Continental are still in use. The old Continental School was replaced in the 1990s by a new facility located about one mile to the east. The old school was refurbished and now serves as the Continental Community Center. The Continental Cemetery is located northeast of the old school, and is now completely surrounded by the Madera Reserve subdivision. Considered to be a holy site by local Indians, the cemetery has been in use since 1903, and the oldest marked grave is from 1918.

Kenneally (born James Jerome Kenneally; 1870 ‚Äì 20 February 1949) was an Australian journalist and trade unionist. An early populariser of Australian bushranger Ned Kelly and his gang via his book The Inner History of the Kelly Gang and Their Pursuers (1929), he was also one of the original members of the country's Labor Party and later formed his own party. Raised in the northeastern part of Australia's Victoria known as \\"Kelly country\\", he taught school, started Tasmania's Timber Worker's Union and was active in the union movement. He ran for the House of Representatives seat for Mernda, Victoria in the 1906 and 1910 elections. He self-published Inner History in 1929, and the work was plagiarised by the press of the day. Twenty years later, it inspired Sidney Nolan's important Ned Kelly series of paintings and, by 1980, over 30 years after Kenneally's death, it had gone through nine editions. The book continues to be referenced as a significant work into the 21st century. Early life and career Born in Gaffneys Creek, Victoria, he was the youngest of the Kenneallys of Goomalibee, Benalla, Victoria who were originally from Ireland; his older brother Matthew (1857‚Äì1937) was born there. James studied at McCristal's College in Benalla and became a schoolteacher, later an auctioneer then an agent. Political career He was active in the union movement, and started Tasmania's Timber Worker's Union. He was one of the original members of the country's Labour Party (ALP). He ran for the House of Representatives seat for Mernda, Victoria in the 1906 and 1910 elections. He won 41% of the vote in the latter election, but lost to Robert Harper of the Commonwealth Liberal Party, who was less than 4 points ahead. He then served as a federal organiser for woodworkers via his position as general secretary of the Sawmill and Woodworkers Association of Tasmania then formed his own party. The Inner History of the Kelly Gang =Content= For his 1929 book, Kenneally put together police statements made under oath at the time of the Kelly break-out and the events leading up to it, with the findings of the 1881 Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Victorian Police. Many of the policemen involved in the saga were subsequently demoted and pensioned off or, in the case of Constable Fitzpatrick, the constable whose initial charges against members of the Kelly family ignited the war between the Kellys and the police, dismissed. He also interviewed Tom Lloyd, a Kelly cousin and so-called fifth member of the Kelly gang, whose information was previously unpublished, such as the whereabouts of the gang when they were in hiding, the manner in which the gang approached Jerilderie (crossing the Murray River at Burramine, New South Wales, arriving from the south instead of from some other direction,) for example. He also incorporated fresh statements from others like William Williamson, whom with Kelly's mother and infant sister, was wrongfully arrested after the Fitzgerald incident and witnesses like Aaron Sherritt's young wife and mother-in-law, Mrs. Barry, who were present at Sherritt's killing, and James Reardon and his wife, and members of the police force who were present at Glenrowan from the commission testimony. Kenneally profiled the main spies for the police and their methods, the treatment of the gang's prisoners at Jerilderie, Euroa, and Glenrowan, the procedures of Supeterintendents C.H. Nicolson and Hare and Captain Standish, all charged at different times with directing the search for the Kellys before the showdown at Glenrowan,‚Äìeven which members of the police merited the Kellys admiration. Finally, he also established the difference between Kate Kelly and her older sister Margaret Kelly (Mrs. Skillion) and Steve Hart when the police could not and the press at the time did not: Ned Kelly had a total of five sisters. His author profile in The Inner History of the Kelly Gang describes Kenneally growing up \\"alive to the reactions of the people who lived in the Kelly country\\" and \\"to the treatment to which the Kelly family was subjected\\": The book was his life's project. It was also one of the first sympathetic accounts of the Kelly Gang, and Kenneally believed it to be the first impartial one). It ends with reviews by Ned's sole surviving brother, Jim, then-aged 70, and a cousin, James Ryan, whose brother Joseph, was one of the 22 held for nearly four months without trial in 1879 for being an alleged Kelly sympathiser. =Critical reception= The book was generally well received. The reviewer for the Melbourne Herald wrote that Kenneally's \\"facts are ably presented,\\" noting \\"most of his evidence is drawn from official sources‚Äîpolice evidence‚Äîshowing the conduct of the constables and their immediate superiors in a very poor light.\\" The reviewer for the Franklin and Somerville Standard wrote that Inner History makes \\"fairly good reading, especially to those whose only knowledge of the gang has been derived from folk tales and the reading of previous works of fiction founded on fact.\\" His one criticism was that although the author seemed determined \\"to paint every action of the police as black as possible,\\" the book throughout \\"has the ring of truth.\\" =Copyright infringements= The book was plagiarised twice by J.M.S. Davies in 1930, the year after its publication, in serialised accounts of the Kelly Gang for Adelaide's Register News-PictorialKelly's \\"manifesto\\" was included as Chapter 13 of The Kellys are Out by J. M. S. Davies, which was serialised in The Register News-Pictorial (Adelaide, SA) in September and October 1930. Chapter 13 begins part way through the Monday, 29 September installment and concludes part way through the Thursday, 2 October installment.Brian McDonald (in his book What They Said About Ned!: Looking at the Legend of Ned Kelly Through Books ..., Australian History Promotions, Bondi NSW, 2004) says of the serialisation that \\"it includes an edited version of the Jerilderie Letter e.g. grammar, spelling, punctuation and the reference to the calf's testicles has been left out.\\" and for the Melbourne Herald. Kenneally had writs from the Supreme Court issued against both papers' publishers, and the latter were forced to pay him compensation. The Herald again managed to ignore Kenneally's copyright four years later in its publication of Roy Bridges' centenary history of Victoria and was again forced to pay Kenneally for breach of copyright. Book's legacy The book is now viewed as \\"a major contribution\\" to the understanding of Ned Kelly and early editions are prized by collectors. It has gone through nine editions: two self-published, six by four different Melbourne-based publishers, and one by Victoria's Standard Newspapers. Sidney Nolan, one of Australia's most iconic painters, used the book as inspiration for his famous 1946‚Äì47 Ned Kelly series. The series of 27 paintings including The Trial, at the National Gallery of Australia, feature the now-iconic figure of Kelly as his black iron helmet. The book appears prominently in the bonus features section \\"Ned Kelly in Popular Culture\\" of the DVD for 2003 Ned Kelly film starring Heath Ledger.\\"Ned Kelly in Popular Culture\\" in Bonus Features in Ned Kelly,\\" 2004 The title of Peter Carey's Booker Prize-winning novel, True History of the Kelly Gang (2000), references Kenneally's 1929 title. Personal life and family He married Emelie Winifred Deegan of Castlemaine, Victoria on 21 January 1903, sister of Poet and author, Thomas Patrick Deegan, in the resort town of St Kilda, a Melbourne suburb. They had three sons and two daughters. He and his brother Matthew maintained a close relationship with the Kelly family: Jim Kelly, the youngest of the Kelly brothers, served as pallbearer at Matthew's funeral in 1937. He died on 20 February 1949, in Royal Melbourne Hospital and is buried in the Fawkner Crematorium and Memorial Park. His wife died five years later, on 15 March 1954. Science writer Christine Kenneally is a great-granddaughter, and wrote a piece about the search for Ned Kelly's skull for the New York Times in 2011, continuing the favoured family pastime.

The species is a solitary bee and is native to tropical Central and South America. The male collects fragrances from orchid flowers, which it stores in hollows in its hind legs. Orchids can be deceptive by mimicking the form of a female and her sex pheromone, thus luring male bees or wasps. Pollination will take place as the males attempt to mate with the labellum, or the tip petal of the flower. Male E. meriana are territorial and have a particular perch on a tree trunk where it displays to attract a female. After mating, the female builds a nest with urn-shaped cells made with mud, feces, and plant resin, and provisions these with nectar and pollen before laying an egg in each. These bees also have complex foraging and wing buzzing behaviors and are part of a mimicry complex. Description Eulaema meriana resembles a bumblebee in appearance and is covered in short dense hairs. At first glance Eulaema bees look like large bumblebee queens. They are relatively large bees with faint metallic colorations. The head of the bee is black, and the thorax brownish black with a large, glossy black scutellum. Their abdomen is black with three transverse pale yellowish bands on the anterior half, and the posterior third is reddish brown. E. meriana also possess membranous wings that are dark at the base and paler at the tips. The legs are black and the tibia of the hind legs are much thicker. Males possess hollows on their hind legs, while females have pollen baskets. In general, the species have long tongues that are thought to be an evolutionary adaptation that favors nectar collection. The large body size is thought to allow the bees to fly in cooler, rainy conditions and continue foraging. It has also been suggested that the larger body size can help them forage for longer distances. =Taxonomy and phylogeny= Eulaema meriana are part of the order Hymenoptera, which includes ants, bees, wasps, and sawflies. More specifically, they are in the bee family, Apidae. E. meriana are part of the Euglossini tribe within the subfamily Apinae. Euglossini are part of a group known as corbiculate bees, a group that also includes honey bees, stingless bees, and bumble bees. Members of this group have depressions on their hind legs that are used for nest construction, cell provisions, and transportation of materials. The Euglossini, or orchid bees, do not have advanced social bees in contrast to the other corbiculate Apinae like the honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees that form colonies with a queen and workers. Orchid bees are considered to be key species in lowland forests because they are pollinators of specific tropical plants. It is in fact the females that perform cross-pollination. They have also been targets of conservation, and the diversity of the euglossine bees as a whole is being affected by habitat fragmentation. E. meriana themselves are closely related to their sister bee, E. bombiformis. =Distribution= Eulaema meriana is native to Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, the Guianas, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil, or most commonly the New World tropics. It is found in forests in the Amazon basin but is replaced in the Atlantic coastal forest by Eulaema niveofasciata and Eulaema flavescens. In general, members of the Euglossini tribe are found mostly in the tropical areas of the Americas, even around Mexico or Argentina. The genus Eulaema itself ranges from central Mexico to northern Argentina.  Nests  = General nest architecture = Nest entrances have a mud wall or ceiling at the entry point, with a very narrow entrance hole (about 15 mm in diameter). The nests contain a pedicel made out of mud, and a number of urn- shaped brood cells fused together. The pedicel increases in size as the overall size of the nest increases as well. The pedicel is built first and its anterior surface is what forms the back of the first brood cell, which is made of a thick layer of mud and has an average volume around 4.8mL. Cell structures have been observed to be similar across nests. Each cell is fused to the wall of the previous cell, and new cells are often observed to be attached along the same plane. The cells are then covered with a thin layer of feces and lined with resin that is extended past the opening to form a collar. After oviposition by the female, the resin collar is pushed inward by the female and then covered with a layer of mud. In larger nests, once a layer of cells is complete, the surface is covered with mud to make a new floor for the next layer of cells to be built. = Nest initiation and construction = After mating, a female usually chooses a cavity as its nesting site. If the entrance is too large, a mud wall about 8-9mm thick may first be built in which a hole about in diameter is made. The mud is gathered in small balls by the mandibles, transferred progressively to the fore, mid and hind legs, and deposited in the pollen basket on the hind leg. About six balls make a load, three in each basket and the female flies back to the nest site. Inside the cavity, a pedicel is constructed on which an urn-shaped cell is built. The mud hardens as it dries. Initiation of a nest begins with mud collection for the mud wall, entrance, pedicel, and first brood cell. This process can take up to four days. Therefore, all trips on the very first day of nest construction are devoted to mud collection. After the first brood cell is nearly complete, the female will begin to collect both mud and resin, which will be used to line the cell on the second day. After the cell is lined, almost no mud is collected on the third day. A female will spend almost three quarters of her time foraging for larval food collection, and the rest for resin collection. Once the brood cell is complete, oviposition will occur, the collar will be pushed in, and the cell will be covered with mud. The construction of additional cells follows a similar timeline, although there is less mud collection now that the mud wall and entrance have been built. It was noted by Cameron and Ramirez in a study done on the nest architecture of the E. meriana that less time was required to build successive cells after the first. Some nests were also observed to be reused. Clusters of older cells and decomposing females were found in some of the cells, covered with a layer of mud. = Brood cell construction = Each brood cell is filled two-thirds of its volume with a pale yellow, sticky pollen/nectar mixture. Females returning to the nest with this sticky substance attached to their corbiculae deposit it into the only open brood cell. The female E. meriana follow a specific ritual after placing this pollen mixture into a cell. They make a rotation with the posterior part of the body inside the cell and forelegs around the resin collar. It is suggested that this allows the pollen mixture to be pushed down and packed into the cell. Other materials like mud, feces, and resin are deposited in the nest. Mud and feces can be found deposited on the floor of the nest, while resin is stuck onto a cavity wall near the pedicel. While the actual size of the nest cavity varied in the study conducted by Cameron and Ramirez, the brood cells of all the nests studied were uniform in size, shape, and structure. The cell structures were also similar to the cells built by other Eulaema species.  Colonies  E. meriana typically begin nests alone, and they remain solitary. Occasionally they form parasocial colonies with two or more females that are from the same generation and may even be sisters. Females work inside the nest at night, constructing cells and ovipositing. One egg is laid in each provisioned cell, and oviposition occurs after the provisions are tamped into the cell. Egg laying happens quickly as the female backs into the cell, holding the collar with her forelegs and inserting her posterior end into the cell. After laying the egg, the female pushes the resin collar in and spends a few hours covering the cell with mud. After this, the female begins to work on building a new brood cell. Larger nests can have multiple females. Females may use the same site over many generations and continuously build upon the nest. In one large nest studied in Ecuador consisting of 76 cells, two females were found together in the nest for at least 17 days. One of the females carried pollen nectar loads on her corbicula and deposited it into the only open cell. A second female carried mud, covering dead females with mud and working on the nest construction. This suggests some level of social plasticity among these solitary bees. For single female nests, each cluster of cells represents the reproductive output for one female. One female on average will construct and oviposit over four or five brood cells before disappearing and leaving the nest. Egg development is rather long, with adults observed to be emerging 100‚Äì165 days after oviposition.  Pollination  Stanhopea avicula orchid flowerAs in other species of orchid bee, both the male and female visit flowers to feed on nectar. Besides this, the male has a mutualistic relationship with one or more species of orchid. To persuade the male to visit its flowers, the orchid produces fragrances of a particular chemical composition attractive to a specific species of bee that is exactly the right size and shape to pollinate the flower. Stanhopea orchids are mostly pollinated by large Eulaema bees, Euglossa species often being too small for the purpose. In more primitive species in the genus Eulaema, the orchid pollinium, a packet of pollen, adheres to the male bee as it reverses out of the flower having collected the fragrance. In more advanced species, there is a fall-through mechanism in which the bee loses its footing on some oil droplets while collecting the fragrance and the pollinium adheres to the bee as it slithers out of the flower. E. meriana has been observed visiting Stanhopea florida and pollinating Stanhopea candida, Stanhopea costaricensis and Stanhopea tricornis. It also pollinates Catasetum macrocarpum and Notylia pentachne. It is also the only bee species thus far reliably documented as a pollinator of a species of Vanilla - Vanilla grandiflora.Lubinsky P, Van Dam M, Van Dam A (2006) Pollination of Vanilla and evolution in Orchidaceae. Lindleyana. 75:926‚Äì929 In a study to identify which insects pollinated the flowers of the Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa), it was found that the flowers were visited by a number of bee species, including E. meriana, which visited the tree early in the day. Both males and females were observed collecting nectar from the base of the flower's lower lip. The study concluded that E. meriana played a part in the pollination of the Brazil nut flowers but that other bee species, Eulaema mocsaryi and Xylocopa frontalis, were of greater importance, thus E. meriana are not required to pollinate Brazil nut flowers. Nevertheless, in commercial Brazil nut tree plantations, successful pollination depends on the plantation being surrounded by intact primary forest with its epiphytic orchid population to supply a sufficient number of pollinating bees for the large number of flowers.Male Eulaema hovering around the Catasetum discolor orchid. = Fragrance collection = Male orchid bees have a large hind tibia with pouches where they store fragrances. Adult male bees spend much of their time filling their pouch with the volatile fragrances found at orchid flowers. This behavior has given rise to the ‚Äúpollination syndrome‚Äù, where males pollinate about 650 orchid species. They apply lipids to these fragrances, and the compounds are collected and stored in the hind tibia with movements involving their entire legs. The fragrances stay in the pouch for a long period of time and form a complex chemical blend. The blends are species specific, and are commonly hypothesized to be used for intraspecific communication in courtship. To the right is a picture of a male Eulaema hovering around the Catasetum discolor orchid.  Wing Buzzing  Males showed increased wing buzzing during each perching session on a tree when they were more active during the day and when ambient temperature was higher. During perching, the male E. meriana grabs the tree with his mandibles and extends his hind legs while sweeping his wings back and forth rapidly. Scientists have suggested three hypotheses to explain the behavioral purposes of the increased wing buzzing. = Visual attraction hypothesis = Some suggest that the bi-colored (half black, half shiny) wings flash the black and yellow abdomen, which could attract females. Others believe that the abdomen is always visible during buzzing due to the angle of the abdomen and the wings, so it is unlikely that the colors of the abdomen are a signal to females. = Thermoregulation hypothesis = Additionally, the buzzing itself is not loud, and is also unlikely to serve as a signal to other members of the species. David L. Stern instead suggests that these territorial males are cooling their body down by buzzing their wings. The males could be thermally stressed because they fly and hover at lower speeds around their territory compared to when they forage, resulting in lower levels of heat loss from the bee. The wing buzzing could be a behavioral mechanism that helps cool the bee in tropical climates as a form of thermoregulation. Moreover, sunlit territories can also elevate the body temperature of the bee. Therefore, a mechanism like wing buzzing could be important to help the bee cool off. Males were not observed to be active when the ambient temperature was greater than 28.5¬∞ Celsius. Others hypothesize that wing buzzing could also serve to disperse fragrances during a mating display. = Chemical attraction hypothesis = E. meriana have jugal combs. It is present in both sexes, but on females it is much smaller. On males, the jugal comb is large in comparison to its body, and under a stereoscope, scientists were able to determine that the jugal comb can be moved across the middle tibial tufts. A research group led by Bemb√© in Germany observed that when the jugal comb was moved across a tibial tuft moistened with water, they observed fine aerosol clouds being sprayed off. They suggested that males can spray fragrances from their mid tibial tufts by vibrating their hind wings, and postulated this spraying to be a part of their courtship displays. Thus, another hypothesis on the purpose of wing buzzing is that the wing vibration could attract other Euglossini.  Behavior  = Foraging activities = Females forage for pollen, nectar, resin, mud, and feces. These materials are packed in the corbiculae and brought back to the nest. Pollen and nectar foraging trips are on average longer than other resource trips. Mud collecting usually takes only a few minutes while pollen and nectar collecting could take up to two hours. Collection times for different materials are also very specific. The female bees collect pollen and nectar from dawn to around noon, while mud, feces, and resin were collected mostly in the afternoon. E. meriana are diurnal, limiting foraging to periods between dawn and dusk. = Mating Behavior =  Territoriality and Transiency  The euglossine bees, also commonly known as ‚Äúorchid bees‚Äù, are best known for the male bees‚Äô collection and attraction of fragrance produced by orchids and other flowers. The exact role of fragrances in the mating system remains unclear, as they are not observed to use them in an obvious manner to attract females or mark their territory. After emergence as an adult, males spend much of their time searching for nectar and fragrances. They can also be found defending territories where mating will sometimes occur. In a four-month study of male territoriality conducted by Stern, E. meriana males showed two alternative behaviors of territoriality and transiency. Transient male bees did not defend territories, but instead flew from one territory to the other. They also did not engage in physical contact with the territorial males. On the other hand, territorial males patrolled an area around a tree and used the same territory for up to 49 days. It also appeared that they gave up territories to new males without violence. Males defend territories solely for mating, and no other resources such as fragrances, nests, nest construction materials, nectar, or pollen are found at these territories. According to Stern's observations on male behavior, transient males hover around a territory while facing the territorial male, and then descend slowly. They will then fly up to the same level as the territorial male and interact with each other, flying around a territory with one bee seeming to chase the other without any physical contact. The territorial male was observed to fly in a zig-zag pattern consistently before the transient male left, whereupon the territorial male would resume its normal patrolling of his area. Male bees could switch from territoriality to transiency. Territory occupancy was not statistically observed to be dependent on tree diameter, but when territories of bees were observed and noted, trees with a diameter between 40‚Äì70 cm were observed to be used more than 20% of the time. The closely related male Eulaema bombiformis prefers trees with a mean diameter of 15.5 cm. Stern suggests this may serve as a reproductive isolating mechanism between the two species. Analysis of occupancy of territories with respect to diffuse and direct light at the site showed that territory occupancy increased with increasing diffuse light and decreasing direct light.  Leks  In a study conducted by Kimsey, an entomologist that specializes in bees and wasps at the University of California, Davis, she defined leks as fulfilling four criteria: 1) males aggregate and display at sites for mating; 2) males defend territories from conspecific (of the same species) males; 3) the territories do not have food or oviposition sites; and 4) the females can choose their mate. Kimsey and her team investigated E. meriana in the Canal Zone for two years. Males of this species are territorial and operate a lek system. Each selects a perch on the trunk of a tree at the edge of a temporary clearing in the forest caused by a fallen tree. None of the territories contained any flowering plants, nest sites, or nest building materials. Territories are found in treefalls or large light gaps in the tropical forest. Trees used by E. meriana were about 20‚Äì30 cm in diameter and the perch site 2-5m above the ground. The trees were noted to be relatively straight with smoothed bark. The male stands in a characteristic pose with its head close to the bark, its front and hind legs extended and its middle legs folded underneath its body. Periodically it \\"buzzes\\", vibrating its wings while opening and closing them to display the yellow abdominal markings. At intervals it takes off and flies a few meters away from the perch before looping back to land close to its previous spot. The same perches are used by males every day, both in the morning and in the afternoon, but are unoccupied for a period in the middle of the day. In ensuing years, the same spots are used again as long as the clearing in the forest still exists. Males repeat cycles of patrolling and perching as long as the male remained in the territory and was not disturbed by other males. Male E. meriana flew about 2-3m from their perch when no males were present, but 4‚Äì6 m when other males were within 5m of their perch. Conflicts were sometimes observed, but were 60‚Äì90 seconds long. The males would fly around each other until the other male left. It appears that male aggregations are seen at favorable mating sites and is likely not due to males attracting other males. The more suitable sites within a treefall, the larger the number of potential territories, and the more males were found in these areas. Kimsey suggests that this type of a lek is a transitional type of lek in the entire evolution of classical leks.  Male-Male Interactions  David W. Roubik of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute observed male E. meriana forming a ball around a recently killed male of their species. They were observed to be biting the dead male‚Äôs hind tibia and scraping them with their forelegs, a behavior typically seen in their chemical harvesting. Roubik notes this as a sort of chemical parasitism ‚Äì it is possible that the dead male had a \\"good\\" blend of chemicals, and the males scraping them off attempted to gather the potentially favorable blend held by a former competitor. Chemicals stored by the male E. meriana do not change chemical composition over the few weeks they are stored. Other species observed on the Barro Colorado island in Panama had unique chemical combinations. Thus, it is hypothesized that if a male has good survival, and has had good foraging success with orchids, saps, resins, or fungi, it could have a better chance of mating.  Female-Male Interactions  Some field observations suggest that male Eulaema meriana collect these volatile fragrances to inform potential mates that they have ‚Äúgood genes‚Äù. When a female approaches a male, the male likely disperses collected odors towards the female ‚Äì it is at this stage that the male would disperse a chemical blend specific to the E. meriana. Males that have lived longer and foraged widely, as evidenced by the chemicals it disperses, could show the female that they are better equipped with ‚Äúbetter genes‚Äù and better survival and foraging skills. Females have large ranges in which they forage and these may contain a number of different male territories, some solitary and others in loose groups. A female attracted to a territory circles around with the male before landing on the perch tree, often taking off and settling several times. The female entering the territory initially appears to be similar to an intruding male. The female E. meriana flies in small circles with the male, and the mating process begins when the male successfully lands on the female's back with mating lasting around 5 minutes. After mating, the females leave immediately. Matings have only been observed when no other males were present. It is not entirely apparent how a male's collected and stored fragrances may facilitate the breeding process. Further research about these chemical stimuli is still needed, as the exact context in which these behaviors are evoked could depend on many environmental factors.  Mimicry  Large bees of the genus Eulaema are found frequently in moderately wet lowland forests of tropical America and show red, yellow, and black colors. E. meriana females sting quite painfully, so the males could be considered to be Batesian mimics to females. Several asilid flies also mimic some of the color patterns found in Eulaema. The most striking mimicry in the Amazon basin and Guiana highlands are the Eufriesea ornate and the Eufriesea limbata who have similar tergum patterns and colors to the E. meriana. E. meriana have also been observed to have slightly different patterns depending the region it is found in. For example, in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua, E. meriana show a ‚Äúflavescens‚Äù pattern, without red or brown, and having pale yellow or almost white bands on the terga. E. bombiformis, E. meriana, and E. seabrai form part of a M√ºllerian mimetic complex in the Amazon basin and are very similar and make distinguishing between them difficult. However, in eastern Brazil near the coast, these three species are easily distinguished. One can see that these three species show different mimetic patterns in different geographic areas ‚Äì sometimes between two species independent of the third, and sometimes involving all three. Robert L. Dressler, an expert on orchids, hypothesizes that these bee patterns have their origin in the Pleistocene geography of America. He suggests that the original isolation that led to speciation of E. meriana and E. bombiformis could have occurred in the early Pleistocene. In the case of E. meriana, there appears to be no obvious ecological factor that explains why the ‚Äúflavescens‚Äù pattern occurs in 3 separate areas in the Neotropical region. Those in Brazil are almost identical to the ones in Nicaragua and El Salvador. Dressler suggests that E. meriana was once monomorphic with only the ‚Äúflavescens‚Äù pattern, but has been replaced by the ‚Äúbombiformis‚Äù patterns like its sister species E. bombiformis because it could be more superior as ‚Äúwarning coloration‚Äù.  Sociality  Mixed colonies in Apidae have rarely been recorded. Sometimes more than one species are observed in a nest, but this is more common in the bumble bees. Some scientists believe that parasites can be viewed as agents that promote sociality among bees in order to promote guarding behavior and cooperation in collective nest construction and maintenance. Roubik suggests that some advantages of colony establishment counters the evolution of eusociality. The mechanism of accepting other nest mates is unclear in E. meriana, but there is a capacity for joint nest maintenance and tolerance. This places limits on female sterility because there is no kin selection. Worker castes and non- reproductive females would not evolve if bees accept newcomers to the nest in order to offset costs of a small colony and risks from enemies. = Polymorphism and social limits = Eulaema show high polymorphism and high proportions of diploid males. After assays of 23 enzymes, Roubik focused on five polymorphic systems with six isozyme loci. E. Meriana had 35% heterozygotes for a HK loci, and 54% heterozygosity for the PGM loci. Diploid males were observed in rather high proportions. Diploid males were not observed to be larger than or more distinctive than haploid males, and responded to chemical baits in the same manner as haploid males. Homozygosity at the sex locus leads to 50% of the diploids being male in Hymenoptera, and diploid males are usually present at some stage of the life cycle. Euglossine polymorphism is almost twice that of bumblebees, stingless bees, and honey bees. Some scientists propose that euglossines lack the types of colonies formed by their relatives because of both high diploid male production and genetic polymorphism. Up to 50% of the bees that are intended to be females (diploids) would be males, therefore the supply of altruistic workers would not be stable. Without a stable supply of workers, colonies would not be able to develop adequately. Because the diploid male larva lives in a thick enclosed cell, females may not eliminate them as readily. There is still much discussion on the mechanisms that prevent inbreeding in euglossines and how chemical collections by males influences mating success or paternity. Some propose that inbreeding is a likely reason for the high diploid male proportion.  Interaction with other species  Because Eulaema are so large, brood cells are large and take longer to provision. Thus the cell remains open for longer, providing an opportunity for parasites and scavengers to enter the nest. = Parasites = Meloetyphlus fuscatus, a meloid beetle, was observed to emerge from one studied nest. The phoretic type of the meloid attaches itself to the bee and is carried back to the nest and functions as a nest parasite. The larvae feed on provisions collected by the bees. There are also two Hoplomutilla conspecta Mickel wasps that were seen inside nests. One was chewing at closed brood cells, but oviposition was not observed. Wasps of the family Leucospidae were found to emerge from nests. In one of the nests observed and followed by Cameron and Ramirez, a total of 51 wasps emerged. One of the cells was revealed to have at least 20 Leucospis pupal exuviae. Leucospis pinna is an ectoparasite of E. meriana, and is the first species of Leucospis that was reported to parasitize members of the Euglossini tribe. It is also the first known member of Leucospidae that has gregarious larvae, with multiple adults emerging from the same cell.

Rolling Green is the only location in Arlington Heights, IL where firing a gun is legal. Early history The club was founded on June 24, 1924 when a small group of suburban businessmen from the North Shore (Chicago) took an option on property owned by Dr. Oughton. They created an operation policy under a trust agreement and decided to call their new venture Rolling Green Country Club, which was named for the rolling terrain. In their first official board meeting, dues were set at $80. They also established a $2 guest fee for Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, and $1 for weekdays. By this time, the group had grown to 100 men. It was decided later that membership would be limited to 350. Dr. Oughton had originally commissioned Donald Ross, a noted golf architect to design the golf course, but later declared the task, ‚Äútoo easy‚Äù and took it upon himself to oversee construction and interpret the blueprints. In the 1926-27 season, a brochure was published that stated that Rolling Green Country Club is situated on the highest peak of land in Cook County. It also added ‚Äúthe roll of the land makes the game of greater interest to the player, and the natural and artificial drainage makes the course playable even after the heaviest rains.‚Äù Women have long been welcome at Rolling Green Country Club. In the spring of 1927, the Board hired Minnie Stiff as the manager of Rolling Green. Her husband Ed also became the club‚Äôs engineer.http://archive.lib.msu.edu/tic/golfd/article/1948mar3.pdf Rolling Green has also always been a welcome place for children. A playground was built in 1929 in a grove of trees, which included slides, swings, and sand boxes. It is reported that the 1929 Chairman of the House Committee said, ‚ÄùAs everyone knows, the formative years are the best ones for learning the ancient and honorable game‚Ä¶By all means, let the boys and girls grow up in a wholesome atmosphere of golf.‚Äù Golf Rolling Green‚Äôs 18-hole golf course that exists today was designed by William H.

The building was built in 1923 for the William L. Elsasser Bakery. The Elsasser name is carved into a stone panel at the top of the red brick building. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006 as part of the admission of the Vinton Street Commercial Historic District. The building's main occupant is currently the River City Saloon.  History  The Elsasser family were bakers from the town of Vaihingen, Wurttemberg, Germany. After arriving in Omaha in the early 1880s, the family patriarch, Christian G. Elsasser, opened the first Elsasser family bakery at 709 Leavenworth Street. The bakery was appropriately named The Leavenworth Street Bakery and appears in the 1883 Wolfe's Omaha City Directory. In 1887, Christian's son, William Ludwig Elsasser, established the W. L. Elsasser Bakery at 2014 South 19th Street. Around the late 1890s, William moved the bakery to 2416 South 19th Street. In 1904, the bakery operation was moved to its final location at 1802 Vinton Street. At the time, the building was a wood-frame structure previously occupied by another bakery. William Elsasser's family conveniently moved to a two-story home behind the bakery at 2706 South 18th Street. When William L. Elsasser died unexpectedly on July 27, 1914, his widow, Susanna, continued to run the bakery with the assistance of other family members. It was under her direction in 1923 that the current brick building was built. The general contractor was Frederick W. Rice, a relative of the family.Frame, Bob, and Chad Moffett. \\"National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Vinton Street Commercial Historic District\\". Nebraska State Historical Society. Retrieved 2014-03-14. After Susanna Elsasser died in 1926, sons William J. and Carl L. Elsasser took over bakery operations. The sons' running of the bakery was relatively short- lived. The last listing for the bakery in the city directories was 1931. By 1940, the bakery had been converted to a bar. Currently, the main occupant of the building is the River City Saloon. Elsasser Bakery Stone Panel The Elsasser Bakery building is a two-story red brick commercial vernacular building. In addition to the Elsasser name carved into a stone panel at the top of the building, other decorative aspects of the building include a stone- capped parapet roof, brick banding, window hoods and stone sills. The center window on the second story is bricked in. When the Elsasser Bakery was in operation there was a large front awning imprinted with \\"1802 Elsasser's Bakery\\". The Elsasser Bakery was a neighborhood bakery serving the residents surrounding it. The bakery's specialties were Vienna and German rye bread. During a Food Administration hearing on the price of bread, Elsasser's Bakery reported total sales in December 1917 of $2,140, with the retail price of a loaf of bread set at 9 cents. The value of the plant and the equipment was estimated at $2,500. The Elsasser family was known throughout Omaha for their large, annual family reunions. The first Elsasser reunion was held on November 1, 1913, across the street from the bakery at Miller's Hall at 1724 Vinton Street. A stained glass window as a memorial to William L.

It was built from 1883 to 1884 by Alexander Fortune for William Doherty. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 1 December 1997.  History  Laurel Hill Farmhouse, 1897 Laurel Hill Farmhouse, a single-storeyed timber farm house with attic, was erected in 1883-1884 for Pimpama arrowroot grower and manufacturer, William Doherty. The builder was Alexander Fortune of Coomera. At the time, Laurel Hill Farmhouse was considered the finest residence in Pimpama district, and in 1897 was photographed by the Queensland Lands Department as an example of a successful Queensland selector's home. Much of the Pimpama district had been taken up in the 1850s by William Duckett White of Beau Desert Station, who leased between the Logan and Coomera Rivers, including upper Hotham Creek (a tributary of Pimpama River), as Pimpama run. A small settlement was established on Pimpama River , but the site was abandoned within a few years in preference to Hotham Creek. Much of Pimpama run was thrown open for selection from April 1869, and White forfeited his remaining leasehold on Pimpama from 1 January 1870. The private subdivision and sale in February 1870 of town and farm lots at the junction of the Pimpama River and Hotham Creek, consolidated Pimpama township and initiated a small farming community of predominantly Irish settlers. In the 1860s, farmers along the Pimpama River experimented firstly with cotton growing, then with sugar, both of which initially were dependent on South Pacific Islands labour. By December 1876 the principal Pimpama sugar plantations (Ormeau, Malungmavel, Pimpama and Yahwulpah) had ceased production, and were devoted either to cattle or arrowroot, but some smaller farms in the district continued with sugar growing for several decades. The Pimpama selectors of the 1870s, searching for a new commercial crop, discovered that the climate, soil, and abundance of pure water in the Pimpama district were ideal for the cultivation and manufacture of arrowroot. Arrowroot gave about the same return as maize or potatoes, but was more frost, drought and flood resistant. The first commercial arrowroot in Pimpama was grown in the late 1860s, and the Lahey family, who moved to Pimpama in 1870 and eventually took up Sunnyside, adjoining William Doherty on Hotham Creek, went into arrowroot cultivation on a large scale, inventing a mechanical processing method which revolutionised the production of arrowroot, and marketing arrowroot under their own brand. By 1884, arrowroot was widely grown in the Pimpama and Coomera districts, and a number of new manufacturing plants were being established. Most of the selections along upper Hotham Creek were surveyed in 1871, but not proclaimed for selection until August 1874. In the interim, many farmers were \\"squatting\\" on these selections, with no guarantee that they would ultimately secure the land as leasehold. Irish-born settlers William Doherty and his wife Eliza Fannon had arrived in Queensland by September 1867. It appears that they were resident in Brisbane until November 1869 at least, but had moved to the Pimpama district by August 1870, when William Doherty signed a local petition calling for a provisional school to be established in the area. It is not known where in Pimpama the Doherty family lived at this period, but William Doherty worked on a number of local sugar plantations and farms before taking up his own selections in the mid-1870s. In October 1874, Doherty selected portion 21, parish of Pimpama ( of second class pastoral land on Hotham Creek, on which Laurel Hill Farmhouse was later built). The block already contained some improvements, including a slab barn and a small humpy and about of scrub cleared and partly under cultivation, for which Doherty paid , and was issued with a conditional lease on the property for 10 years from 1 January 1875. At the same time he selected the adjoining portion 31 with , on which existing improvements comprised a bark-roofed barn, a small slab house, some cleared scrub and a small stockyard. It appears that the Dohertys resided on portion 31 from October 1874 until mid-1879, when they moved to portion 21. In 1879, Doherty also acquired the lease to portion 151, an 84-acre block which abutted the eastern boundary of portion 21. In January 1884 he obtained title to portions 21 & 31, and embarked on substantial improvements to the property, which he had named Laurel Hill. A fine new house, erected for the Dohertys by Coomera builder Alexander Fortune, was completed by late January 1884. (This is understood to be the existing Laurel Hill Farmhouse.) Fortune, resident in the Coomera district by 1872, was a carpenter by trade, and had erected Coomera State School and an Anglican church at Upper Coomera. At Laurel Hill, William Doherty raised cattle and grew various crops. By 1884 he had between 40 and under arrowroot, and erected his own factory in the first half of the year. Remnants of this mill survive. Before the turn of the century, he purchased Pimpama Plantation at Ormeau, (approximately which he used for grazing purposes), and acquired Sunnyside, the Lahey family's substantial arrowroot plantation adjacent to Laurel Hill on Hotham Creek. Following William Doherty's death in 1904, the properties were divided between his three sons: Laurel Hill went to William Alexander (Alex), Sunnyside (renamed Willowvale by the Dohertys) to Thomas, and Pimpama to Robert. By 1908, Queensland farmers on about a dozen farms in the Yatala, Pimpama, Ormeau and Nerang districts, were supplying almost the whole of the arrowroot used in Australia. Doherty Brothers of Hotham Creek and Robert Doherty of Ormeau, with together approximately under arrowroot (or 50% of the total under arrowroot in these districts), were among the largest arrowroot growers/producers in Australia. The Willowvale arrowroot mill was moved further downstream on Hotham Creek, closer to the Pacific Highway at Pimpama, and continued production until the mid-1930s. Alex Doherty at Laurel Hill turned to dairying in the early 1920s before retiring to the Gold Coast . Subsequently the property was purchased by the Miles family of Pimpama, with title to Laurel Hill transferred in 1950. Members of this family resided in the house until mid-October 1997. The Doherty family were prominent members of the local community, involved in church and civic affairs. William Doherty was a trustee of Pimpama School of Arts and served as a councillor on Coomera Divisional Board from to . His son Thomas later became chairman of Coomera Shire. Some changes to the farmhouse were made during the Doherty family's occupation. There is evidence of minor re-arrangement of internal partition walls, and the staircase to the attic has been removed and the stairwell enclosed, possibly in the 1920s. The ceiling linings in several of the rooms may date to the 1920s also. The original kitchen wing reputedly burnt down in the late 1920s, and was replaced with the present kitchen building.  Description  Signage Laurel Hill Farmhouse, a single-storeyed weatherboard residence with a corrugated iron gable roof and timber stumps, is located fronting Ruffles Road to the northwest. The residence has verandahs to four sides, with a separate kitchen wing at the rear connected via a covered landing. Original attic windows, one to each gable end, have been infilled with weatherboard. The verandah has a corrugated iron skillion roof, with a timber-lined ceiling (partially removed) and timber posts, capitals and brackets. Sections of the verandah have deteriorated and partially collapsed, and only a few sections of balustrading, consisting of dowel balusters and timber handrail, survive. The building has weatherboard cladding to the side and rear walls, and a single-skin externally cross-braced wall to the front verandah. The main entrance, consisting of a panelled timber door and fanlight, opens off the front verandah and is flanked by two French doors with fanlights on the northern side and a French door and fanlight on the southern side. Multi-pane sash windows open to the side and rear verandahs, and a timber door opens from the living area to the south-east verandah and covered landing, and a second door with fanlight opens to the north-east verandah. The kitchen wing consists of an unpainted weatherboard structure with a corrugated iron gable roof and timber stumps, with a corrugated iron lean-to addition at the rear. This structure has sash windows to the main section, with corrugated iron and timber batten hoods, and hopper and louvred windows to the lean-to. A timber door opens to a covered landing to the northwest, and a second door opens to the southeast with timber steps to ground level. Internally, the residence has a large living area facing the southeast and northeast verandahs, with two bedrooms to the southwest and two bedrooms to the northwest. Ceilings and walls are unpainted, and the original attic space has been closed and the access stair removed. The ceiling of the living space has been altered and now consists of plywood sheeting with timber battens, and some internal walls may have been altered and partially re-lined. Door heads are not of a uniform height, and the main bedroom has French doors opening from the central hallway, also suggesting some alteration to internal walls. The exterior walls have wide horizontal boarding, and the internal walls have vertical boarding. The bedroom ceilings vary, with some comprising raked cornices with joists supporting floorboards for the attic above, and others finished with timber boarding. Internally, the kitchen wing has unpainted ceilings and walls. The main section contains a dining area and bathroom, and has vertically boarded walls and a boarded ceiling. The rear lean-to addition houses the kitchen with a stove recess at the northern end. The building's immediate surrounds include overgrown gardens to the northwest fronting Ruffles Road, with the remains of a rock garden to the north of the house. There are also a number of large trees to the north and south, and the remains of a partially demolished shed to the northeast.  Heritage listing  Laurel Hill Farmhouse was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 1 December 1997 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Laurel Hill Farmhouse survives as an important illustration of the pattern of Queensland's history, demonstrating the success of arrowroot growing and manufacturing in the Pimpama district in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when this Queensland region supplied almost the whole of the arrowroot used in Australia. As early as 1897, the house was considered illustrative of what the Queensland land selection system could achieve, and was promoted officially as the ideal type of settler's residence. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. It is rare to find an early 1880s farm house as intact as this on the Gold Coast hinterland, which has experienced enormous pressure for development in the last quarter of the 20th century. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The place has potential to provide important information about rural timber building techniques of the early 1880s, and about the types of materials used. The s kitchen wing appears to have been constructed to much the same footprint as the earlier building it replaced, survives very intact, and in materials and form complements the 1880s building. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Laurel Hill Farmhouse survives reasonably intact, and is important in illustrating the principal characteristics of an early 1880s settler's farm house with unpainted interior and original joinery. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place is valued by the local community for its long association with the Doherty family and their work in the local community, and for its illustration of pioneering achievement. The Willowvale/Pimpama community has a number of families descended from the first European settlers in the area, who value Laurel Hill Farmhouse as an important link with the past.

At the 2016 Australian Census, Goolman recorded a population of 42.  Geography  The east of Goolman contains the northern foothills of the Flinders Peak Group. The slopes remain vegetated with little development occurring in the area. History The locality name Goolman comes from nearby Mount Goolman, which in turn derives its name from stone axe in the Yuggera language. Residents in the Fassifern Valley petitioned the Queensland Government to build a railway line to their district, and the first section of the Dugandan railway line was opened on 10 July 1882 as far as Harrisville. This is considered to be Queensland's first branch railway. Goolman was served by the Goolman railway station on the Ipswich Boonah Road (). The branch was extended to Dugandan on 12 September 1887. The line closed in 1964. Goolman was a stop along the Dugandan railway line. Nature reserve The Flinders - Goolman Conservation Estate covers 1,900 hectares and includes several peaks including Flinders Peak, Mount Goolman, Mount Blain and Mount Cathrine.

It is in the village of Marston Bigot within the English county of Somerset, England. The house is a Grade II* listed building. History Several deserted medieval settlements are located within the park. The earliest description of Marston House is contained in a letter from Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork, in 1641, when he purchased the Manor from Sir John Hippisley. In 1714, Marston was inherited by Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery, who rebuilt it. The house later passed to John Boyle, 5th Earl of Cork, and successive generations, who each left their mark on the house and grounds, including Edmund Boyle, 7th Earl of Cork who added Marston Pond, a boathouse, and three gate lodges. However, late in the 19th century the house fell into disrepair and it was sold in 1905 to the Bonham-Christie family. The US Army used Marston House and its grounds during World War II, and John and Angela Yeoman of Foster Yeoman Ltd finally rescued the property from dereliction in 1984, using it as the company headquarters. Foster Yeoman put the house on the market in 2012 at a price of ¬£6 million. The house was purchased by Timothy Sanderson, Chairman and Chief Investment Offices of Sanderson asset management. Architecture It is built of squared and coursed Doulting stone with a slate roof and balustraded parapet, located on a long terrace with stone urns. The house is long but generally only deep, therefore presenting a massive facade when viewed from the park. In the three- storey central block of this front are four Ionic columns, which were built by Sir Jeffry Wyattville around 1817, with two-storey wings on either side, which were added in 1776 by Samuel Wyatt. =Gardens= The garden at Marston House is listed Grade II in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England. Stephen Switzer laid out the gardens between 1724 and 1745. They cover an approximately rectangular area of approximately . They include a rustic, rectangular-shaped, above-ground limestone grotto dating from 1743, north-east of the house near the Frome road, which was built by James Scott. Much of the 18th century lay out is now hidden by a lake which was created in the 1820s and 1830s, as part of a restyling in the style of Capability Brown, with advice from William Sawrey Gilpin. The lake is now used for private fishing. The farm includes a herd of 60 Hereford cattle.

The township was named from the Scottish immigrants who were descendants of the 71st Regiment of the Royal Army. The 71st Regiment of Foot was first formed in 1758 from the 2nd Battalion, 32nd Regiment of Foot. Soon after formation the 71st Foot was part of a raid on the French coast at Cherbourg during the Seven Years' War. After taking the fort and destroying the docks the regiment reboarded and returned to England before it took part in a similar raid on Belleisle in 1761. In 1763 the 71st became a Regiment of Invalids before disbanding in 1768. The regiment was raised again at Inverness, Stirling and Glasgow by Lieutenant-General Simon Fraser of Lovat as the 71st Regiment of Foot in 1775. It was intended for service in the American Revolutionary War and was well received in Glasgow: \\"Their conduct was so laudable and exemplary as to gain the affections of the inhabitants, between whom and the soldiers the greatest cordiality prevailed.\\" The regiment embarked for North America in April 1776, fought in New York at the Battle of Long Island, Brandywine in 1777, Savannah in 1778. The regiment was also present at the Siege of Charleston in March 1780, the Battle of Camden in August 1780 and the Battle of Cowpens in January 1781. It next fought at the Battle of Guilford Court House in March 1781 where one officer of the 71st Regiment claimed that \\"one half of the Highlanders dropped on that spot.\\" The regiment's last action was at the Siege of Yorktown in September 1781. Scottish Highlanders had previously fought a war of rebellion against the British in the 1700s but were defeated at the Battle of the Culloden Moore in 1746. After their lands were confiscated; their clan chiefs executed and kilts and bagpipes outlawed, many of the Highlands Scots emigrated to North America and settled in the Sandhills of North Carolina.

Farming was established at Villeneuve in the late 1870s. Villeneuve Provisional School opened on 30 May 1887 with a new building erected in 1888 which it shared with the Anglican Church. In 1902 it was renamed West Vale Provisional School. It was temporarily closed between September 1907 and July 1908 due to poor student numbers. It closed permanently in February 1910. St Barnabas' Anglican Church was dedicated on Sunday 9 September 1888 by local rector Reverend J.F. Leighton. It occupied shared premises with the provisional school with the school room being the nave of the church with a chancel being added for church services. It closed circa 1961.

It first appeared in 1926 from the Munich-based publisher Delphin-Verlag. In 190 wordless images the story follows an unnamed woman in a German city in the early 20th century whose life of poverty and misfortune drives her to infanticide, prostitution, and murder. The book was the first whose images were made with leadcuts instead of the more common woodcuts, and showed a greater depth of character and cinematic sense than previous wordless novels. The book inspired American artist Lynd Ward to tackle the medium, beginning with Gods' Man in 1929. Ward's success brought about an American publication of Destiny in 1930 which sold well. The book has impressed critics and has become one of the best-known wordless novels. Synopsis The book follows an unnamed woman in a German city in the early 20th century who lives a life of poverty and misfortune. She is the constant victim of her society‚Äîespecially the men, such as her drunken, abusive father, and the traveling salesman who gets her pregnant. She is imprisoned for the murder of her unwanted child, and upon release turns to life as a prostitute. The police hunt her down after she murders a man with an axe, and as she jumps from an upper-floor window they shoot her dead. Background Frans Masereel pioneered the wordless novel genre with woodcut artwork. From 25 Images of a Man's Passion, 1918 Otto N√ºckel (1888‚Äì1955) was born in Cologne in the German Empire. He studied medicine in Freiburg before switching to art, which he studied in Munich in 1910‚Äì12. His paintings were less successful than the illustrations he made for magazines such as the satirical Simplicissimus and for books by Thomas Mann and E. T. A. Hoffmann. In 1918, the Belgian Frans Masereel created the first wordless novel, 25 Images of a Man's Passion, and followed it up the next year with his longest and most successful work, Passionate Journey. Such books achieved particular popularity in Germany, where they sold in the hundreds of thousands in the 1920s. Masereel's woodcut artwork drew inspiration from the German Expressionists and displayed socialist themes of struggle against social injustice, themes that were to be common in the wordless novel genre. Production and publication N√ºckel's medium was the leadcut‚Äîengraved plates of lead‚Äîa medium N√ºckel turned to when he found wood in short supply in Germany. Lead plates are also more economical than wood in that they can be melted down and reused if errors are made during engraving. Destiny was the first wordless novel to employ lead engraving. N√ºckel made 190 prints in black and white for the book. The images range in size from to and were originally printed on pages of thin Japanese handmade paper when the book was published in Germany in 1926. =Editions= * Das Schicksal: eine Geschichte in Bildern (1926). Munich: Delphin-Verlag * Destiny: A Novel in Pictures (1930). New York: Farrar & Rinehart * Schicksal eine Geschichte in Bildern (1984). Z√ºrich: * Destin (2005). Paris: * Destiny: A Novel in Pictures (2007). New York: Dover Publications Style and analysis Though well-received, Destiny was to be N√ºckel's only wordless novel. Self-portrait, 1920 N√ºckel engraved his plates with a multiple tool (also called a lining tool), a sort of chisel that cuts multiple parallel lines at once, which gives a mechanical hatching texture to the print. The images vary not only in dimensions but in focus, from close-ups of faces to panoramas of crowds. In contrast to the earlier works of Masereel, Destiny focuses on an individualized woman instead of the plight of a man as cipher for humankind. Lynd Ward found N√ºckel's book had greater psychological depth in its characters and plot development, and more skilled technical achievement in the artwork. Canadian artist George Walker believed that Masereel's plots were more original. Reception and legacy American artist Lynd Ward discovered a copy of N√ºckel's book in New York in 1929 and was inspired by it to create wordless novels of his own, beginning with the same year. The success of both Gods' Man and the subsequent Madman's Drum (1930) led to a number of American publishers bringing other wordless novels into print, including Destiny in 1930, which sold well in the US. Literary scholar Martin S. Cohen called Destiny \\"perhaps the most pathetic ... and one of the most memorable\\" examples of the wordless novel genre. Wordless novel scholar David Beron√§ judged the book \\"a pioneering work in the development of the contemporary graphic novel\\" for the complexity of its plot, its social consciousness, and its focus on an individual character. Reviewer Christian Gasser commended the book's \\"narrative pull\\", which he credited as creating a \\"haunting, edgy narrative rhythm\\" of a story of persecution, satire, and Expressionist art. The story, he suggests, may be allegory of the Weimar Republic in which it arose.

She was member of the Tuscan branch of the Imperial House of Habsburg, an Archduchess of Austria and Princess of Tuscany by birth. After the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, she lived in exile, first in Barcelona and from the 1930s until the end of her life in Italy. In 1937, she married an Italian diplomat, Marchese Francesco Maria Taliani de Marchio. The couple, who had married in their forties, did not have children.McIntosh, The Unknown Habsburgs, p. 53  Early life  Archduchess Margaretha was born on 8 May 1894 at Lemberg, Galicia, (modern day Lviv, in western Ukraine), then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. She was the third among the ten children of Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria and of his wife Infanta Blanca of Spain. She was christened Margarita Raineria Maria Antonia Blanka Leopoldine Beatrix Anna Josephina. Called \\"Meg\\" within her family, she received the name Margarethe in honor of her maternal grandmother, Princess Margherita of Bourbon-Parma, who had died a year earlier.Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 294 Archduchess Margaretha grew up in the last period of the Habsburg monarchy. She was raised with her many brothers and sisters in the various properties owned by her parents. While in Vienna, they lived at the Palais Toskana with Schloss Wilhelminenberg as their country state. Vacations were spent in Italy where Infanta Blanca owned a rural property near Viareggio. Theirs was a multi-cultural household as Margaretha's paternal ancestors had reigned in Austria, Tuscany and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Her maternal family had reigned in Spain, Parma, Modena, Portugal and France. Archduchess Margaretha was educated in the company of her sisters Dolores and Immaculata. The three archduchesses, very close in age, were artistically inclined.Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 115 Margaretha had a passion for drama. She learned, besides her native German, French, Spanish Hungarian and Italian. Margaretha had allure, culture and intelligence, but was plain.Mateos Sainz de Medrano, An Unconventional Family, p. 13 During World War I , Margaretha's father was inspector general of artillery and her eldest brother, Archduke Rainier joined the Austrian army to fight in the Italian front. While Margaretha and her sister Immaculata worked for the Austrian red cross.Mateos Sainz de Medrano, An Unconventional Family, p. 14  Exile  At the fall of the Habsburg monarchy, the republican government of Austria confiscated the properties of the Habsburgs. The family lost all their fortune.McIntosh, The Unknown Habsburgs, p. 48 Margaretha's two eldest brothers, Archdukes Rainer and Leopold, decided to remain in Austria and recognized the new republic. The rest of the family moved to Spain in January 1919. They lived in Barcelona, with simplicity for more than fifteen years. The unleash of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 forced Archduchess Margaretha, her mother and her unmarried siblings to leave Spain. Archduchess Margaretha married late in life. Her husband, Francesco Maria Taliani, Marchese di Marchio (22 October 1887 ‚Äì 16 March 1968), was an Italian diplomat. The wedding took place on 27 November 1937 at Schloss Sonnberg, property of her brother Archduke Anton and his wife Princess Ileana of Romania. Archduchess Margaretha and her husband settled in Nanjing, then capital of China, where Taliani served as the Italian ambassador to China between 1938 and 1943. It was a turbulent period. In December 1937, Japanese troops occupied Nanjing. In June 1940, Italy entered World War II siding with Germany and Japan. When, in September 1943, Italy surrendered to the Allied forces, Archduchess Margaretha and her husband were detained and interned in a Japanese concentration camp until the summer of 1945.Hamann, The Habsburgs, p. 447 Early in 1946, Archduchess Margaretha and her husband returned to Italy. Margaretha's husband was very wealthy and avid art collector. They bought a house in Venice. In February 1951, they moved to Spain, where Margaretha's husband served as the Italian Ambassador to Francisco Franco's government until 1952, when Taliani was forced to retire. The couple settled in Rome. After twenty years of marriage, Francesco Maria Taliani de Marchio died in 1968, age 80. In her widowhood Archduchess Margaretha lived between Rome and la Tenuata reale, a rural property near Viareggio that she shared with her sisters Dolores and Immaculata. Archduchess Margaretha outlived her two sisters. At her death in Rome on 21 June 1986, at age 92, she bequested la Tenuata reale to the commune of Viareggio to serve as public and cultural center. Her nephew, Archduke Dominik, inherited her fortune. Ancestry Notes Bibliography *Hamann, Brigitte. The Habsburgs: a biographical dictionary. Ueberreuter, 1988. . *Harding, Bertita.

Some sources give Lemberg as his place of birth.  Life  His father was a teacher at the Vienna Polytechnic Institute. In 1856, he began to study lithography, but wasn't satisfied and switched to the Academy of Fine Arts where he remained until 1861, when his father was unable to continue paying his tuition and still support a large family. Friends came to his assistance, but it wasn't until 1867 that he achieved some success with his painting \\"The Storyteller\\". This helped him obtain a position in the studios of Karl von Piloty in Munich, where he worked for two years.02418 Eduard Kurzbauer, Matrikelbuch 1841-1884; (Zugriff vom 24 September 2009) His associates there included Hans Makart and Franz Defregger. Afterwards, he continued to study independently and scored his first major success in 1870 with his genre painting Die ereilten Fl√ºchtlinge (The Refugees, Overtaken), which was purchased for the gallery of the Schloss Belvedere. This sale, the commissions that followed and the fees from several students enabled him to take a long-desired study trip to Rome and Naples. Unfortunately, an ailment he acquired there was left untreated until it was too late. After courageously suffering through several painful operations, he died at the age of thirty-eight, still at work, even on his death bed. He had a sharp eye for interesting situations and human characteristics, with an occasional splash of roguish humor. Even when representing weakness and suffering, he knew how to maintain the correct tone, without bathos. He is considered a master of chiaroscuro. In 1889, a street in Leopoldstadt was named the \\"Kurzbauergasse\\" in his honor.

In 2012 it ran 13 practices, had 250 employees and provided a variety of NHS services across London. Dr Clare Gerada is one of four GP partners in the firm. It was noted during her active campaign against the Health and Social Care Act 2012 that the group could face substantial competition from private providers if they were allowed to compete equally to provide NHS services. Other GPs were reported as complaining that the Hurley Group was \\"swooping in and taking over in areas where it normally has no business\\". Expansion of larger organisations like the Hurley Group has been advocated as a means whereby the quality and capacity of primary care services in England could be enhanced, for example by the King's Fund report in 2011. Dr Arvind Madan, Partner and Chief Executive made a presentation to the Nuffield Trust event \\"Transforming general practice: unlocking the potential\\" in May 2013. In June 2014 the group was awarded a five year ¬£17m contract to provide urgent care centres outside Queen Mary‚Äôs Hospital and Erith Hospital by Bexley Clinical Commissioning Group.

In June 2018 the practice announced that it planned to use its eConsult online system for most consultations. This enables patients to submit their symptoms to a GP electronically, and offers around the clock NHS self-help information, signposting to services, and a symptom checker. 12 GPs are using eConsult and it is planned to recruit 12 more, so patients will only be seen in person where necessary. 340 other practices are also using eConsult, a majority of the 479 GP practices are expected to have implemented an online consultation system by April 2018.

He co-produced the Billboard award- winning 52-hour 1978 edition of The History of Rock and Roll rockumentary. He also spent 20 years as the Music & Entertainment Editor of Reader's Digest. Theroux's work over the years has resulted in multiple Telly, Golden Reel, N.Y. Festivals, Billboard, and Communicator Awards. Over his 1982-2002 run as the Music & Entertainment Editor of Reader‚Äôs Digest he strategized, directed teams, and helped manage RD's Home Entertainment Division, marketing in 33 countries. He created, programmed, produced, and annotated more than 300 CD/DVD releases which collectively have sold more than 39 million copies. During Theroux's tenure his division of the Reader's Digest Association grew in stature to account for no less than 60% of the RDA's entire corporate income (while the flagship magazine was generating only 25%). Theroux began in radio at age 11, quickly developing the ability to climb into the heads of target demos other than his own and custom-craft programming just for them. His extensive knowledge of music and pop cultures of all eras and genres allowed him to create definitive LP and later CD collections in a broad spectrum of styles. A founder of Reader‚Äôs Digest Video, he created many of their biggest TV triumphs, such as America In The '40s (PBS), Legends Of Comedy (Disney), and An Old-Fashioned Christmas (syndicated). He also assembled such award-winning series and specials as Remembering The ‚Äò70s, Elvis, On A Country Road (with Lee Arnold), In Touch (with Kris Erik Stevens), The 100 Greatest Christmas Hits of All Time (with Wink Martindale), The Golden Years, The Halloween Spooktacular (with Kerin McCue), and, most famously, the 52-hour History Of Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll (winner of Billboard‚Äôs ‚ÄúTop Special Program Of The Year‚Äù award). The author of many articles, liner notes, and books, Theroux is a former format designer/programmer and Director of Special Features for Drake-Chenault Enterprises. A longtime DJ, actor, narrator, commercial spokesman, scriptwriter, and UCLA instructor, Gary is also an entertainment historian, maintaining files (bios, photos, reviews, etc.) on more than a century of hit music, films, and TV programming. From 2007 to 2011 he served as managing producer-head writer for Armstrong InterActive's Emmy- winning TV programming. Theroux is one of the industry leaders on the Nominating Committee of The Hit Parade Hall of Fame. In 2014 he completed both the goodtime comedy screenplay and novelization versions of his yet-to-be- published Knight Before Christmas. The History of Rock and Roll In 1975, Theroux found that the script of the 1969 production of The History of Rock and Roll contained many inaccuracies and omissions. As Drake-Chenault programmer/DJ/music historian and Director of Special Features, he researched, rewrote, and rebuilt the program entirely from scratch. The new version dramatically expanded the story with fresh interviews, insightful narration, more music, and a host of innovations‚Äî-all in a modular format which allowed stations more programming flexibility. Bill Drake knew that the rising popularity of stereo FM rock stations made it necessary to redo the show in stereo. The documentary approached each year of the history, between 1955 and 1977, with a focused half-hour, and devoted separate segments to key artists and trends.http://www.drakechenault.org/special.html Bill Drake himself narrated the rockumentary. Among other things, Theroux had Drake-Chenault chief engineer Mark Ford painstakingly assemble two kinds of annual montages: one of each chart-topping hit of a given year (in sequence) and the other of other key songs there was no time to play in full. Those #1 hit montages were reprised for the climactic final hour of the show, edited together back to back, to create a fast-paced 45-minute medley of every chart-topping hit from 1955 to the fall of 1977. The 1978 edition of \\"The History of Rock & Roll\\" debuted as a marathon broadcast over more than 400 domestic stations and another 400 overseas, and won Billboard magazine's \\"Top Special Program of the Year\\" award. That success sparked Theroux to write \\"The Top Ten: 1956‚ÄìPresent,\\"Gilbert, Bob and Gary Theroux, \\"The Top Ten: 1956-Present,\\" Pop Record Research, Fireside Books, Simon & Schuster, New York. 1982 (). a book about the ten biggest hit records of each year. Theroux eventually hosted his own version of \\"The History of Rock 'n' Roll\\" as a fast-paced syndicated daily 2-minute feature.https://web.archive.org/web/20030618123946/http://www.historyofrocknroll.com/ The online showcasing of that feature led to it winning the title of \\"Best Online Program\\" in the New York Festivals International Radio Programming Awards global competition. 2018 marked the eighth year of worldwide syndication (through Envision Networks) of Theroux's award-winning \\"100 Greatest Christmas Hits of All Time,\\" which is now heard in more than 75 countries around the world. The ten-hour radio special, hosted by Wink Martindale, counts down the 100 largest-selling, highest-charted and best- loved original hit Yuletide recordings (both singles and key album tracks), from Bing Crosby's 1942 \\"White Christmas\\" to the present. More than 160 stars contribute holiday greetings and the stories behind the songs. The countdown, which is updated each year, also features a number of \\"bonus tracks\\": rare and surprising tracks by stars few knew ever made Christmas recordings. 2019 will mark the debut of Theroux's latest television project, the 70 minute documentary \\"Inside The History of Rock 'n' Roll.\\" Fourteen key hitmakers of the 1955-69 era are profiled in the production via historic performance clips, rare home movies, and insightful audio interviews with everyone from Bill Haley, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, and Elvis Presley, to Buddy Holly, Jerry Lee Lewis, Dion, The Ronettes, and Ray Charles.

At the time of its abolition, the First Chamber had 151 members.Information Please Almanac, Atlas and Yearbook, Volume 24, Dan Golenpaul, McGraw-Hill, 1970, page 358 These were indirectly elected for eight-year terms of office, from amongst the county councils (landsting) and city councils (stadsfullm√§ktige), which formed electoral colleges, some of which holding elections every year, with local elections being held every four years in even years when elections to the Second Chamber were not due to be held.Understanding the Swedish Model, Frank Cass, 1991, page 111 During a large portion of the long tenure of power for the Social Democrats (between 1932 and 1976), the party remained in control of legislation thanks to its strong position in the First Chamber.Coalition Governments in Western Europe, Wolfgang C. M√ºller, Kaare Strom, Oxford University Press, 2003 , page 201 If the two chambers made contradictory decisions in budgetary matters, they were required to meet in joint assembly to make a \\"coherent\\" decision on the issue. In other matters, no legislative outcomes could be established if the two houses were in disagreement, but issues could re-addressed by submitting a new proposal. Co- ordination between the two chambers was facilitated by the Riksdag having standing joint committees composed of members from both chambers.Swatantra, Volume 9, Issues 1-26, page 12 This is rare for two-chamber systems, which generally only employ temporary joint mediation committees to resolve a dispute between the chambers, or reserve standing joint committees for very narrow functions.The Parliamentary Role of Joint Standing Committees in Sweden, Neil C.

Second Chamber) was the lower house of the bicameral Riksdag of Sweden between 1866 and 1970 that replaced the Riksdag of the Estates. The upper house was the F√∂rsta kammaren. At the time of its abolition the chamber had 233 members, who were elected for four-year terms of office by men and women over the age of twenty.Information Please Almanac, Atlas and Yearbook, Volume 24, Dan Golenpaul, McGraw-Hill, 1970, page 358 Both chambers had the same powers. At the last general election in 1968, the Social Democrats received more than half the votes.  Early composition  Until 1916, the Andra kammaren was composed of 230 members, elected by popular vote. Members of the chamber served for three-year terms and were typically sworn in during September of the election year, except in the case of mid-term appointments, for which solemnization was immediate; members of the chamber appointed midway through a term finished out that term and then were required to achieve re-election at the regular interval to retain their seat.  Changes after increased voter enfranchisement  1916 saw significant changes to regulations governing elections and the compositions of Sweden's legislature. Suffrage was extended, with all men aged 24 and older allowed to vote, with certain exceptions for those who were in poor legal or financial standing with the state. Membership in the chamber itself was also opened up, with all male citizens who met the eligibility standards to vote capable of attaining a seat of equal standing within the lower chamber. In 1924, the right to vote for and stand in the second chamber was extended to women, provided that they were Swedish citizens who were over the age of 23 by the year the election took place. In 1970, as a part of broader governmental reforms, the two houses of the Riksdag were merged into a unicameral body, initially of 350 members.  Location  The Second Chamber of Parliament House, hosting the Right Livelihood Award ceremony in 2009. From 1867 to 1904, sessions of the Andra kammaren took place in the Old Parliament House on the island of Riddarholmen, where both the upper and lower chamber had their own hall. In 1905, the chamber moved to new facilities in the newly constructed Parliament House on the island of Helgeandsholmen. The ornate furnishings of the new hall included fine wood paneling with three noteworthy frescoes ( \\"Landscape with Beacons\\", \\"Torgny Judge at the Thing in Uppsala\\", and \\"Engelbrekt at the head of the peasant army\\") added in 1913 by the artist Axel T√∂rneman. The second chamber's facilities continue to serve in various ceremonial capacities, including hosting the annual Right Livelihood Award ceremony.

Estimates on how much gas is in the Karoo vary, with the Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimating reserves of 390 trillion cubic feet, which would make it the eighth largest reserve in the world. These figures, however, were based on desktop research and would only be refined through an extensive exploration programme In the present day, the Karoo is a semi-desert stretching over 400,000 square kilometers and home to a population of around 1 million people.Karoo Space ‚ÄúKaroo by numbers‚Äù Karoo Space.

However, because the formations were deep underground and technology was not advanced enough to pursue such interests, commercial interest did not follow until recent times.

In March 2014, state legislation was passed that allowed for the state to claim 100% of mining ventures, which drastically changed the 20% claim that was initially envisioned in previous negotiations. Such state control has led to concerns about the potential for business improprieties similar to those committed by Enron in the United States.Allix, Mark. \\"Fracking Remains an Unknown Quantity in SA‚Äôs Future Energy Mix.\\" Business Day Live.

If results that come from the exploration process promise worthwhile benefits, environmental impacts will be assessed and commercial fracking will occur, although it could take a decade to produce results. Hydraulic fracturing process In order to access the natural gas trapped by shale, vertical drilling is used to puncture deep boreholes to access deeply buried shale deposits.Kotze, Petro. \\"Hydraulic Fracturing: Adding to the Debate.\\" The Water Wheel Groundwater Special Edition, 2013. Web. 30 Mar. 2014. As the casings are cemented in place, horizontal drilling starts to access the production zone. Economic impacts One of the major arguments in favor of hydraulic fracturing in South Africa is that it could bring much needed economic benefits to the country. A national unemployment rate of around 25%, with the Karoo representing many of those unemployed, offers a large incentive for allowing hydraulic fracturing in the region. Unfortunately the majority of the unemployed are also unskilled and are unlikely to receive any jobs needed for the technical drilling operations 90% of electricity in South Africa is generated using coal, which many see as unsustainable, and even coal-generated electricity is unable to reach over 10% of the population.Hedden, Steve, Jonathan D. Moyer, and Jessica Rettig. ‚ÄúFracking for Shale Gas in South Africa: Blessing or Curse?‚Äù African Futures Paper 9 (2013): n. pag. ISSAfrica.com. Dec. 2013. Web. 30 Jan. 2014. It is expected that shale gas would serve as an additional fossil fuel and would not replace the domestic use of coal or the extraction thereof. South Africa is largely dependent on foreign imports for crude-oil needs, with 70% being imported.Burkhardt, Paul. ‚ÄúSouth Africa Seen Facing Legal Battle Over Fracking Rules.‚Äù Bloomberg.com. Bloomberg, 16 Oct. 2013. Web. 14 Mar. 2014. Eskom Holdings Ltd. produces nearly all of South Africa‚Äôs electricity, but has struggled to meet demands. South Africa has experienced rolling blackouts as a result of energy infrastructure challenges, which disrupts crucial manufacturing and mining capabilities. According to recent research, a power generating capacity of 4,800 megawatts will be needed every five years for twenty years in order to keep up with rising energy demands in South Africa. While South Africa slowly moves towards fracking, American petroleum company Anadarko made an offshore discovery of a potentially very large natural gas reserve that could drive production in Mozambique, which could make it a potential competitor with South Africa. South Africa is already involved in Mozambique through domestic oil company Sasol, which is developing turbines powered by gas fields in the country. The economic benefits of fracking are claimed to be potentially immense. In a controversial study commissioned and paid for by Shell, one of the applicants to explore for shale gas in South Africa, developing one tenth of the estimated Karoo for fracking could generate 200 billion rand per year and create 700,000 jobs. Some characterize fracking as a more sustainable energy solution, avoiding the costs of emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, of which South Africa is considered one of the ‚Äúworst offenders globally.‚Äù Proponents are eager to meet the South African promise to reduce harmful gas emissions by 34% by 2020. Controversy Opposition to hydraulic fracturing in South Africa led to the government-imposed moratorium on fracking in 2011. Since the moratorium has been lifted, opposition has continued. This has led to ongoing debate on what regulations will be imposed, who will enforce them, and how they will be enforced.Wild, Sarah. \\"Opposition to Fracking Peters out.\\" Mail & Guardian. Mail & Guardian Online, 14 Feb. 2014. Web. 30 Mar. 2014. However, many opponents continue to fight for comprehensively halting shale exploration in the Karoo. =Economic concerns= Some opponents of fracking in South Africa are skeptical of the economic benefits it may have. Some analysts have argued that the complicated process of pumping, purifying, and finding necessary materials (such as sand and water) needed for fracking activity imposes too many costs to make the venture profitable. Others are skeptical of the estimates of reserve quantities, economic benefits, and job creation. While estimates by the EIA originally had the Karoo holding 485 trillion cubic feet of shale gas, new estimates from the Petroleum Agency of South Africa now state the number to be closer to 40 trillion cubic feet.Gosling, Melanie. ‚ÄúFracking Revenue Still Not Clear ‚Äì Shell.‚Äù IOL SciTech. Independent Online, 11 Mar. 2014. Web. 14 Mar. 2014. A Shell-commissioned study still contends that such a number would yield returns of 9.6% of South Africa‚Äôs GDP. Farmers in the Karoo are also concerned that development in the area could damage the viability of agricultural work, disrupting the sensitive natural landscape they work in. Lastly, fracking rights are in conflict with a radio telescope planned to be placed where Shell wishes to frack. The telescope represents a $1.87 billion investment, and can only work if placed far away from industrial activity. =Environmental concerns= The main concern raised against fracking is of the environment. In order to extract the gas, water and chemicals must be blasted into the shale at high pressures.Van Tonder, Gerrit, Fanie De Lange, Gideon Steyl, and Danie Vermeulen. ‚ÄúPotential Impacts of Fracking on Groundwater in the Karoo Basin of South Africa.‚Äù GWD.org. Institute for Groundwater Studies, 2013. Web. 30 Jan. 2014. This process concerns opponents of fracking because of the potentially chemical leaks into sub-surface aquifers, which could affect thousands of hectares of land for many years. Radioactive particles could also pollute groundwater, which is already scarce in the Karoo.Blaine, Sue. \\"Fracking Chemicals Will Put Karoo Water at Risk, Says UK Climate Envoy.\\" Business Day Live. BDFM Publishers, 27 Mar. 2014. Web. 30 Mar. 2014. Proponents of the process argue that a well-maintained regulatory environment, with emergency event control protocols, would prevent environmental catastrophes from occurring.Esterhuyse, S. ‚ÄúTowards the Effective Management of Groundwater Resources During Unconventional Gas Mining.‚Äù GWD.org. Centre for Environmental Management, 2013. Web. 30 Jan. 2014. In the United States, leakage has been reported in less than 1% of wells. Proponents also argue that more casing can be used while drilling to prevent leakages and environmentally friendly chemicals have been developed to prevent leaks from being harmful to local water supplies. Finally, proponents contend that aquifers depended on for human use in the Karoo are generally shallow, while shale pockets that could be extracted from are deeper, so contamination is less likely. A flowering Karoo environment.Multiple concerns about water needed for hydraulic fracturing have arisen. For the first 24 exploratory wells alone, it is estimated that 57 million gallons of water will be needed. However, low rainfall levels and high evaporation make South Africa the 30th driest country in the world, which is especially concerning to many opponents of fracking given the semi-desert environment of the Karoo. Local villages are especially vulnerable to water shortages, often depending on a small number of wells for drinking, washing, and irrigating. South Africa is projected by some to run out of water by 2025, and 95% of available fresh water was allocated by 2005. Proponents propose transporting water from areas with a surplus in the immediate area, avoiding the depletion of local supplies. Other strategies could involve piping in seawater after it has been purified or taking water from the Orange River, although these strategies have limitations. Transportation burdens existing infrastructure, and purification of seawater is costly. Skeptics of the alleged sustainability of hydraulic fracturing have also voiced concerns. While natural gas may burn cleaner than energy sources such as coal, there is still a danger for the extraction process to release methane into the atmosphere, which is more potent than carbon dioxide. Opponents also contend that there is not enough infrastructure for natural gas extraction in South Africa to replace coal, meaning that natural gas will be exported and coal will remain the source of energy of choice domestically. Proponents are more optimistic that hydraulic fracturing will act as a bridge towards the development of other sources of renewable energy, decreasing the need for coal and oil consumption. Opponents counter that while this strategy would decrease natural gas prices and therefore carbon dioxide emissions, the lowered prices of natural gas would deter further investment into the renewable energy sector. Further environmental concerns voiced by opponents to fracking include the potential impacts of truck congestion on and damage local road systems at great financial costs to municipalities, which could also exacerbate soil erosion on dirt roads in an already sensitive environment. Fracking could also threaten regional food security by destabilizing meat and crop production that occurs in the Karoo, which feeds some of the poorest people of South Africa. Lastly, because 40% of the plants found in the Karoo are unique to the regions, there are concerns that fracking could threaten the biodiversity of the region. =Cultural concerns= Because life in the Karoo is intimately connected with the region‚Äôs groundwater supply, many opponents of fracking are concerned with the destruction of cultural traditions if fracking were to be introduced to the region. Dr. Marie Jorritsma, an ethnomusicologist at the University of Witwatersrand, argues that there is a deep connection between the people in the Karoo and the environment itself, which is expressed through music (especially in church congregations). Focusing on the town of Kroonvale, Jorritsma contends that fracking could disrupt local water supplies, destabilizing local economic practices and forcing the abandonment of significant cultural practices. While gradual changes are tolerable by local communities, sudden and irreversible changes such as fracking might prove too difficult to adapt to. According to Jorritsma, this would leave ‚Äúa static and stricken landscape and a deathly silent soundscape.‚Äù References South Africa Category:Petroleum in South Africa ","title":"Hydraulic fracturing in South Africa"},{"id":"42205630","title":"Mario Little"},{"id":"42205638","text":"Allium scilloides, called the fragile onion, is a plant species endemic to the US State of Washington.

Brian Lowry of Variety gave a mixed review, saying \\"As intriguing in the details as it is uncomfortable to watch, 'Chrisley Knows Best,' a self- consciously sitcom-like reality show, initially seems to be just another knock-off designed to cash in on the 'Duck Dynasty' demo. Cut through the deep-fried window dressing, though, and this USA series is almost entirely devoted to its subtext, intended to elicit sniggering regarding that which goes unsaid about the show's wealthy father of five, whom his son-in-law understatedly dubs 'flamboyant.' Played as epic farce, the skein should have a disparate range of appeal, but let's hope the Chrisleys don't mind being laughed at, not with.\\" In his review of the second season, Lowry described it as \\"a throwback that recycles old sitcom plots, under the guise of an unscripted series,\\" further stating that the first two episodes \\"drive home just how set up every conceivable beat of 'Chrisley' is, concocting situations\\" to provide Todd Chrisley with \\"opportunities to roll his eyes and assert his authority.\\" From 2015 to 2017, the series won the NATPE's Reality Breakthrough award for best docusoap. In 2016, it was nominated at the 22nd Critics' Choice Awards for \\"Best Unstructured Reality Series\\", but lost to Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown.

The battle was fought for control over the heights of Djebel el Ahmera and Djebel Rhar, together known as Longstop Hill and vicinity, between the British forces of the First Army and German units of the 5th Panzer Army.Blaxland p. 35 The infantry of the 78th Battleaxe Division and Churchill tanks of the North Irish Horse captured Longstop Hill after bitter fighting, in which the tanks created a measure of tactical surprise by driving up the hill, a manoeuvre that only Churchill tanks could achieve. The attackers broke through the German defences, which were the last great natural barrier on the road to Tunis.Blackwell pp. 173‚Äì75Sulzberger p. 114 Background The Run for Tunis, an Allied effort to capture Tunis in late 1942 following Operation Torch had failed and since the end of the year, a stalemate had settled on the theatre as both sides paused to re-build their strength. The 5th Panzer Army (Hans- J√ºrgen von Arnim) defending Tunisia was being strengthened as was the Allied First Army (Kenneth Anderson).Watson pp. 66‚Äì67 In January 1943, the German- Italian Panzer Army (Erwin Rommel) confronting the Eighth Army (Bernard Montgomery) had withdrawn westwards and joined the 5th Panzer Army. Army Group Africa was formed, with the two Axis armies under command of Rommel. In March, the Army Group was defeated by the Eighth Army at the Battle of Medenine and the Battle of the Mareth Line which fell after Rommel's return to Germany.The Oxford Companion to World War II (Oxford University Press 2001) edited by I.C.B. Dear. In the central west, north of Medjez el Bab and some from Tunis, the First Army continued to fight for the dominating, German-held peaks, in the Medjerda Valley. This included a massif with the hills known as Djebel Ahmera and Dejebel Rhar.Ford pp.53‚Äì54 =First battle= On the night of 22/23 December 1942, the 2nd Battalion, Coldstream Guards mounted an attack in heavy rain, capturing what they thought to be the whole massif, before being relieved by the U.S. 18th Regimental Combat Team. The Germans counter- attacked, driving the Americans off Djebel el Ahmera but the next night the Guards recaptured the hill only to find, when daylight came, that another summit, Djebel Rhar, remained to be assaulted. During the night the Guards attacked once again and captured the second hill but they were later driven off by a German counter-attack on Christmas Day. Progress towards Tunis was blocked, so the senior Allied commanders, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in North Africa, and General Sir Harold Alexander agreed that further advances were to be delayed. Thereafter the massif was known by the Allies as \\"Longstop Hill\\" and by the Germans . The name Longstop is taken from the lay-back position behind the wicket keeper near the boundary of the cricket field.Perrett p. 154 By mid-April 1943, because of increasing German pressure the British had withdrawn and had lost possession of \\"Longstop\\" and all of the higher ground to the north-west, culminating in the Djebel et Tanngoucha.Perrett pp.160‚Äì70 =Plan= On 20 April, the British troops of the 1st Battalion East Surrey Regiment supported by the 48th Royal Tank Regiment took a nearby hill known as Djebel Djaffa from the Germans, managing in the process to capture several panzers. On 22 April, the 38th (Irish) Infantry Brigade of the 78th Division captured the fortified town of Heidous and the craggy slopes of Tanngoucha.Evans pp. 125‚Äì36 The capture of these positions made sure that the high ground behind Medjez was taken and the next objective would be Longstop.Ford pp. 52‚Äì53 The 78th Division commander, Vyvyan Evelegh, ordered the 36th Infantry Brigade (Brigadier Bernard Howlett) to seize Longstop Hill by an attack from the south-west. The brigade comprised the 6th Battalion Royal West Kents, the 5th Buffs (East Kents), the 8th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and the 1st East Surrey Regiment, were detailed for the attack on Longstop, supported by the North Irish Horse equipped with Churchill tanks and by most of the 78th Division artillery. The Royal West Kents and the Buffs were to lead the attack whilst the Argylls, who were to be held back in reserve at the start, were to pass through the Kents and seize Djebel el Rhar, the right hand higher end of Longstop. If successful, the Surreys with the North Irish Horse were to be prepared to exploit north- eastwards along the road to Tebourba. Defending the position was the 999th Light Afrika Division (Generalmajor Ernst-G√ºnther Baade) which was composed of the 962nd Afrika-Sch√ºtzen-Regiment and the III/754th Grenadier Regiment. They had adequately prepared the area for defence and were supported by anti-tank guns, mortars and dug in machine gun nests. Battle Tunisia Campaign operations 20 April to 13 May 1943 On 22 April, the Surreys, Buffs, West Kents and Argylls dug in, using shallow gullies and depressions wherever they could find them in the open ground, in preparation for the attack. At 8:00 pm the artillery fire of 400 guns, which would last all night, signalled that the battle for Longstop Hill had begun. At 11:30 am the next morning the Surreys and the Argylls advanced but German machine guns and mortars began to inflict casualties on the start line. The 962nd Regiment repulsed the attacks of the West Kents and the Buffs trying to capture Djebel Rhar. This delay had made it impossible for the Argylls to capture the main hills during the hours of darkness. Soon after dawn, Howlett, seeing that his original plan had been too ambitious, went forward and made another plan for the Argylls and the Surreys, supported by the North Irish Horse, to seize the Djebel Ahmera (the western half of Longstop). =Djebel Ahmera= The Argylls were supported along the southern slopes of Longstop by two squadrons of the North Irish Horse. Behind heavy concentrations of artillery, the Highlanders went up the Djebel Ahmera ridge through heavy machine-gun fire, advancing in box formation through a cornfield. As they reached the base of the hill the commanding officer, Colin McNabb, was killed by shellfire and the attack soon lost cohesion but Major 'Jock' Anderson soon took over command and urged the Argylls to press on. Despite heavy casualties, the Argylls climbed up the hill and were soon among the defenders and started to eliminate the ring of machine gun nests. For inspiring his men and eliminating strong points during the fighting around Djebel Ahmea, Anderson was later awarded the Victoria Cross. The citation for Anderson's award stated: By nightfall, the Argylls, reinforced by the Surreys had managed to complete the capture of Djebel Ahmera along with 200 prisoners and held the hill. The West Kents had moved closer up in reserve but an attempt during the night to capture the next higher peak of Djebel Rhar failed, owing to heavy mortar fire on their forming-up place. =Sidi Ahmed= Churchill MKIII tank armed with a 6 pounder gun; the role it played in the capture was crucial On 24 April, an attempt was made by the Surreys, the 5th Northamptons and a squadron of tanks, to clear Sidi Ahmed ridge just north of Longstop Hill, which contained a white mosque occupied and used as a defensive position by the Germans. In this attack the tanks helped the infantry on to the ridge, which was captured in spite of intense mortar and machine-gun fire. The positions were reinforced by anti-tanks guns and mortars in anticipation of a counter-attack which never came. =Djebel Rhar= During 25 April, no further advance was made by the British but the troops on Djebel Ahmera strengthened their positions and the tanks remained upon the southern slopes. The capture of Djebel Rhar was to take place the next day. A diversionary attack started on 26 April at 8:30 am but the Germans brought down heavy mortar fire on the southern flanks of the hill. The attack mopped up a number of snipers who lay hidden on the southern slopes in ravines and also resulted in the capture of a number of prisoners. On the left at the same time, the Buffs left their start line and worked forward with a squadron of tanks, on the lower northern slopes of the hill and another squadron supporting them on their main axis of advance. The Churchill tanks descended the gully between Djebel Ahmera and Djebel Rhar and with the Buffs appeared on the north-west slopes; the tanks had remarkably traversed the steep southern slopes. With tanks and infantry working together, they were heavily engaged with mortars and small arms fire. The tanks then reached the defensive rim, eliminating the surprised German strong points one-by-one with BESA machine-gun and 6-pounder fire. A tank led by Sergeant O'Hare was the first to reach the summit, breaching the headquarters and capturing fifty prisoners; three more tanks followed having finished their extraordinary drive, getting up inclines that were so steep that in places they had gradients of 1:3. The rest of the regiment arrived and headed up the slopes and with the Buffs eliminated more strong points and cut off escape routes, completing the capture of Longstop and by 11:00 am the battle was over. Aftermath The Buffs had lost nine killed and 83 wounded but between them and the North Irish Horse they had captured over 300 prisoners making the total 650, including all of the III/754th Grenadier Regiment's senior officers. One of the German officers noted that when he saw the tanks coming over the summit, \\"I knew all was over\\". Other prisoners simply could not believe that tanks had played a role in the capture of the position until they were shown; another called the Churchill tanks \\"metal mules\\".Doherty P108 With the summit in the hands of 78th Division, the British began to consolidate Longstop Hill against counter- attack and the fire from nearby hills. By 27 April, the whole of Longstop Hill and Djebel Rhar had been secured, enabling Wilberforce and the Surreys to be relieved. Longstop was the last great natural barrier barring movement towards Tunis. On 7 May, British armour rolled into Tunis, taking the Axis forces there by surprise, some were caught emerging from shops and bars. By 15 May, all Axis forces had been cut off and soon surrendered with more than 250,000 taken prisoner.Anderson (1946), p. 14 Joseph Goebbels admitted it was on the same scale as the Third Reich's disaster at the Battle of Stalingrad and the name Tunisgrad was coined for the defeat.

The fundamental documents of the union were only the Convention of Moss and the revised Norwegian constitution of 4 November 1814. The Norwegian constitution had been adapted to the union before it was entered into, but the Swedish one was never adjusted correspondingly. The conservative Swedish Riksdag had not allowed the Swedish constitution of 1809 to be revised. Vogt, Carl Emil (2014): Herman Wedel Jarlsberg. Oslo, Cappelen Damm, p. 232. Therefore, a bilateral treaty had to be negotiated in order to clarify procedures for treating constitutional questions that had to be decided jointly by both governments. The Act of Union (Riksakten) was negotiated during the spring of 1815, with prime minister Peder Anker leading the Norwegian delegation. The treaty contained twelve articles dealing with the king's authority, the relationship between the two legislatures, how the executive power was to be exercised if the king should die before the crown prince had attained majority, and the relationship between the cabinets. It also confirmed the practice of treating questions of foreign policy in the Swedish cabinet, with the Norwegian prime minister present. Vital questions pertaining to the Union were to be treated in a joint cabinet meeting, where all the Norwegian ministers in Stockholm would be present. The Act was passed by the Storting 31 July 1815 and by the Riksdag 6 August, and sanctioned by the king on 15 August. In Sweden the Act of Union was a set of provisions under regular law, but the Norwegian Storting gave it constitutional status, so that its provisions could only be revised according to the procedures laid down in the constitution.

It is one of five medieval buildings built at Illinois' public universities under Illinois Governor John Peter Altgeld's administrations; the buildings are collectively known as Altgeld's castles. The Old Main originally housed all of the offices and classrooms for Eastern Illinois, its library, auditorium, and gymnasium. It was the only building on campus until 1909, when Pemberton Hall opened. The building is now used mainly as an administrative building, though it still contains some classrooms.

The Swiks (or Swix) was a three-masted schooner from √Öland that sank in the Baltic Sea, off the island of √ñland, Sweden, on 21 December 1926. History Swiks was built in Upesgriva (between Ventspils and Riga; see Mƒìrsrags), Latvia in 1902, by K. Karkle for Indrik S. Puhlin from Riga. Puhlins nickname was \\"Svikis\\" (\\"super durable\\"); hence probably the ship's name. Puhlin operated the ship until 1912, when it was taken over by a partnership with J.E. Johansson as the principal owner and after 1916 with J.M. Andersson; she was based in V√•rd√∂ in √Öland. She was then sold to Arthur Lundqvist in 1924. Characteristics She was made from pine and oak fastened with galvanized iron bolts, and measured in length with a beam of . She had a net tonnage of 227 tons and the payload of 135 virke. Wreck The ship, with a crew of seven, was sailing from Flensburg, Germany to her homeport, Mariehamn, with only ballast on board. A snowstorm forced the ship to try to round north of √ñland, to seek shelter in Kalmar, but the rounding attempt failed and the ship got stuck in the sand dunes below the water (√Ñngg√§rdsudden) near the beach of Trollskogen. The crew abandoned ship and got to land in a lifeboat, walking through the forest of Trollskogen before reaching Grankullavik, where they were cared for a week. One crew member had gotten blood poisoning from a rusty nail and was cared for in hospital. The wreck of the Swiks lay off the beach until a winter storm in the 1950s threw her up on the beach, where she broke in two. Some farmers from B√∂da bought it hoping to be able to salvage the wood and iron, but this proved too costly. In 1977 one of the sides was still intact.

Currently she is working as a professor at the Pondicherry University and conducts ecological research in different regions of India. She has authored a few books, including Whispers from the Wild, co- authored with E.R.C Davidar and published by Penguin India books. She was elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2012. She is actively involved with the conservation of forests and wildlife. She has published about 100 papers in scientific journals. Early life And Family Dr. Priya Davidar grew up in Ooty, Tamil Nadu, which is known of its rich variety of fauna and flora. She witnessed the loss of wildlife and nature as she grew up, which motivated her to get into the field of conservation. She said, In a competition for space, other species are rapidly losing out to humans.\\" Davidar's father is a conservationist E.R.C. Davidar and brother Mark Davidar is one of the founders of the Sigur Nature Trust (SNT), in Masinagudi, Tamil Nadu, India which is a 30-acre wildlife reserve. She married Jean- Philippe Puyravaud who is a research scientist trained in remote sensing. They have collaborated on many research papers.  Education  She completed her B.Sc. in 1973 from Madras University and then moved on to get an M.Sc. in 1975 from the same university. In 1979 she was awarded a Ph.D. from Bombay University and later moved on to acquire a S.M. from Harvard University in 1985. For her doctoral thesis, she worked on pollination of the hemi-parasitic mistletoes by nectar feeding birds, under the guidance of the naturalist, Salim Ali, who is known as the \\"bird man of India\\".  Work  As a conservation biologist, her work mostly revolved around forest ecology, pollination biology and endangered species conservation. She worked for close to three decades in Pondicherry University at the Department of Ecology and Environmental Sciences until she retired. Currently, she is working on a research project where she is ‚Äúanalysing tree distributions at the bio- geographical scale, and the conservation genetics of endangered species such as the Asian elephant and Nilgiri Tahr‚Äù She is one of the few women who were field biologists in the 1970s. Though scientists who have only carried out research inside of their laboratories do not adjust well to fieldwork, Allison Snow, who was a fellow postdoc in Panama remarked, \\"Priya was ‚Ä¶ unfazed by all the practical difficulties.\\"  Challenges  Dr. Davidar has been vocal about the inherent gender bias found in the field of Ecology. When asked about how she was treated by her male colleagues, she said, \\"\\"They suggested that I get married and stay in the kitchen. I used to take it quite personally and suffered a lot. Now, I realize this only creates needless stress for oneself.\\" She also acknowledges that caste can be another barrier in the field which is mostly dominated by people who belong to the upper caste. She said that though there are no proper statistics, \\"caste-based nepotism is very much a part of academic recruitment procedure\\". She also added, \\"My advice to researchers from disadvantaged backgrounds unwelcome in upper-caste networks is to find collaborators who are supportive to buffer the harshness. Being persistent and carrying on despite difficulties is important. What I found is, time is an important ally that leads to eventual success.\\" According to her, field work can sometimes be challenging to women researchers due to \\"large gangs of mostly young men from cities, prowling around in the jungles drinking and looking for trouble. Anonymity probably gives them cover for harassment of women.\\" In such cases, however, it is the locals who help them as they tend to feel protective of the women researchers.

She is recognized primarily for her in-depth study of Entamoeba histolytica, a parasitic protozoan that causes amoebiasis: Dr. Bhattacharya's laboratory first detected Ribosomal RNA genes on Circular DNA, while studying the parasite, and also discovered families of retrotransposons in the parasite genome. Her work has primarily been in the fields of Molecular Parasitology and Gene Regulation. Bhattacharya is a professor at the School of Environmental Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). She is a fellow at The National Academy of Sciences, India, Indian Academy of Sciences and Indian National Science Academy (2014).  Education and career Sudha Bhattacharya attended University of Delhi where she graduated with a BSc.(Hons) degree in Botony in the year 1971 and then proceeded to the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi where she obtained her MSc. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. She completed her post-graduation in 1973 and then, in 1977, earned a Ph. D. for research on regulation of RNA synthesis in Escherichia coli. She has conducted post-doctoral research on bacteriophage genetics at Stanford University (1977‚Äì79), bacterial DNA replication at the Boston Biomedical Research Institute (1979-1981) and studied axenic cultivation at the National Institutes of Health (1985‚Äì86). Prior to joining the Jawaharlal Nehru University, Bhattacharya has worked at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences as a research officer from 1981‚Äì82 and at the Tata Research Development and Design Centre as a scientist from 1982-85 to research on DNA- based diagnostic methods for common diseases. She joined JNU in 1986 as an Assistant Professor and set up her lab to study E. histolytica. She has also served on the academic committee of various boards affiliated to JNU. In her attempt towards recognising environmentalists who rely on traditional knowledge, she found Jadhav Payeng from Assam who converted 1,00 acres of dense land into a forest for rhinos and elephants.  Academic and Research Achievements  Dr. Bhattacharya received global acclaim for her novel findings in the field of simple molecular biology of E. Histolytica. Her lab found the existence of ribosomal RNA genes on round DNA, and located families of retrotransposons inside the parasite genome. Study on the replication of rDNA established the existence of replication origins inside the rDNA circle, which were differentially used in response to growth strain. Expression evaluation of rRNA and r-proteins discovered the post-transcriptional regulation of ribosomal biogenesis. Her work on retrotransposons confirmed that retrotransposition is observed by means of excessive frequency recombination- which could contribute to series polymorphism determined in retrotransposons. Her lab also applied the widespread insertion site polymorphism of retrotransposons to broaden a way for pressure typing of E. Histolytica clinical isolates.

Biography Cypress Grove was born into a musical family. He was taught by his father, a professional jazz drummer, to play drums from a very early age, but by the time he turned 16, his passion became the guitar. Musical career Cypress Grove & Jeffrey Lee Pierce As his passion for the guitar developed he became infatuated with pre-war acoustic blues. This led to an encounter in 1988 with Jeffrey Lee Pierce from The Gun Club who shared similar interests and which grew into a collaboration on an album of roots material, Ramblin' Jeffrey Lee and Cypress Grove with Willie Love in 1992. Cypress and Jeffrey went on to tour the album both with a band and as an acoustic duo. In October 1994, Pierce and Grove were filmed for Henri-Jean Debon's Hard Times Killin' Floor Blues The film was eventually released in 2008. Ten years after, Pierce died of a brain hemorrhage in 1996, Cypress discovered a tape of them rehearsing songs that Jeffrey had written. These were works in progress, and while the quality was deemed too poor for release, Cypress invited a number of musicians to record the songs properly and help him complete them. This series became known as The Jeffrey Lee Pierce Session Project, an endeavour that has currently produced three albums. Cypress Grove & Lydia Lunch photo by Beatrice Ciuca Grove has recorded with a number of musicians including Nick Cave, Debbie Harry, Chris Stein, Mark Lanegan, Iggy Pop, Isobel Campbell, Thurston Moore, Warren Ellis, The Raveonettes, Crippled Black Phoenix, Mick Harvey, David Eugene Edwards, Hugo Race, Bertrand Cantat, Barry Adamson, Lydia Lunch, Jim Sclavunos, Mark Stewart and James Johnston.

The grant  Don Bernardino Antonio Genov√®s belonged to a merchant family that was rapidly growing in the nobility thanks to the strong support to the crown, especially financial and political. His father Antonio Francisco had become Marquis of the Guard in 1699 and himself got the prominent title of Duke of San Pietro in 1737, thus becoming the most relevant Sardinian subject.

Vacca Odone, p. 445. being Villahermosa the name of the village to build and populate and Santa Croce (Saint Cross) the church to dedicate. Therefore, it consisted in an unpopulated fief.  The renewal  The Duke never succeeded to populate the fief and the village and the church were never built. Upon his death, the treasury took the fief over for debts, but his son managed to obtain a new grant to a nephew, Stefano Manca di Thiesi, a Marquis of Mores's cadet grandson and a cousin of the Duke of Asinara. Technically, the act of grace by which the king makes an extinct title live again is called a renewal.Ordinamento dello stato nobiliare italiano (Statute of the Italian nobility status), art. 5.

She was the first woman engineer from Karnataka. During her tenure at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, Chatterjee was a professor and later chairperson of the department of Electrical Communication Engineering.  Early Life and Education  Chatterjee was born in 1922 in Karnataka. She had her primary education in a \\"special English school\\" founded by her grandmother, Kamalamma Dasappa, one of the first women graduates from Mysore and who was very active in the field of education especially those of widows and deserted wives. After her school finals, she was tempted to take up History but eventually chose physics and mathematics. She studied in Central College of Bangalore and earned B.Sc (Hons) and M.Sc degrees in Mathematics. In both these exams she ranked first in the Mysore University. She received Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar Award and M.T. Narayana Iyengar Prize and the Walters Memorial Prize respectively for her performances in the B.Sc and M.Sc examinations. In 1943, after her M.Sc, she joined the Indian Institute of Science(IISc), Bangalore as a Research Student in the then Electrical Technology Department in the area of Communication. She went to C.V. Raman to work under him. Some sources say that Raman refused to take her stating that Rajeshwari had no degrees in Physics. While others say that he was averse to the idea of having women students. After the Second World War, an interim government was set up in India to transfer power from the British to Indians, which offered scholarships to bright young scientists to study abroad. She applied for one such scholarship in the field of electronics and its applications, and in 1946, she was selected as a \\"bright student\\" by the Government of Delhi and was given a scholarship to go abroad to pursue higher studies and she chose to study in University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in the United States. In the 1950s it was very difficult for Indian women to go abroad to pursue higher education. But Chatterjee was determined to do so. In July 1947, one month before India's independence, she started her journey to the USA on a converted troop ship SS Marine Adder and reached there after 30 days. In the US, she was admitted to the University of Michigan and obtained her master's degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering. Then following the guidelines of the contract she had with the Government of India, she underwent an eight months' practical training in the Division of Radio Frequency Measurements at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington D.C. After the completion of the training she went back to the University of Michigan in 1949 on a Barbour scholarship and resumed her studies. In early 1953 she obtained her Ph.D degree under the guidance of Professor William Gould Dow and successfully completed her dissertation.  Career in India  In 1953, after obtaining her PhD degree, she returned to India and became a faculty member at the IISc Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, later saying that she taught \\"electromagnetic theory, electron tube circuits, microwave technology, and radio engineering\\". That same year, she married Sisir Kumar Chatterjee, who was a faculty member of the same college. After their marriage, she and her husband built a microwave research laboratory and began research in the field of Microwave Engineering, the first such research in India. In the same period, Chatterjee was selected for the position of Chairman in the Department of Electrical Communication Engineering. Over her lifetime, she mentored 20 PhD students, wrote over 100 research papers, and authored seven books. Following her retirement from the IISc in 1982, she worked on social programs, including the Indian Association for Women's Studies. = Books = * Elements of Microwave Engineering * Antenna Theory And Practice * A Thousand Streams: A Personal History * Dielectric And Dielectric Loaded Antennas * Advanced Microwave Engineering: Special Advanced Topics * Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam: The Whole World Is But One Family: Real Stories of Some Women and Men of India * Antennas for Information Super Skyways: An Exposition on Outdoor and Indoor Wireless Antenna, co-authored by Perambur S.

Her grandmother, Kamalamma Dasappa, was one of the first women graduates in the erstwhile state of Mysore. Rajeswari married Sisir Kumar Chatterjee, a faculty of IISc in 1953. The couple had a daughter Indira Chatterjee, who is now a Professor of Electrical and Biomedical Engineering at the University of Nevada, Reno, USA.  Awards  For her contribution and works in the field of Microwave engineering, she won many awards.

Dropulich nominated for the special Senate election for Western Australia held on 5 April 2014, but failed to win a seat.  Background  Dropulich, a Perth-based civil engineer and mining project manager who formerly worked at Rio Tinto, conceived the idea to form his own political party with the help of friends in early 2013. The former gridiron player for the Australian representative team achieved the required 500 members for his Australian Sports Party to be eligible for party status by asking friends and acquaintances to join. Dropulich has said that he had been in interested in politics his whole life despite having never been a member of a political party. Following his initial election, he received criticism for his non-committal stance towards a range of political issues.  2013 Federal election  Although he received only 1,908 first preference votes in the 2013 federal election, under the single transferable vote system in place for Senate elections he was able to gain the required 123,304 votes to meet the Senate quota in Western Australia. The Australian Sports Party had been involved in preference swap deals organised by Glenn Druery as part of the Minor Party Alliance. Initially, Dropulich did not win a seat, but was elected to the Senate upon a recount of the ballots. The Australian Electoral Commission admitted to losing a significant number of Western Australian Senate ballots prior to them being counted, which resulted in the election being referred to the High Court sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns.

It has been designed with the primary goal of easing development of Windows Store apps for Windows 8 and Windows 10, as well as Windows Phone apps for Windows Phone 8.1, Windows 10 Mobile and Xbox One applications using HTML5 and JavaScript, as an alternative to using XAML and C#, VB.NET or C++ (CX). WinJS started as a technology that was specific to Windows Store apps, but has evolved to aim at working in any Web browser. In April 2014, during the Microsoft Build developer conference, WinJS was released under the Apache License as free and open source software with the intent to port it to other than Microsoft platforms. A site dedicated to demonstrate the library has also been published. Future development is focused on maintaining what currently exists in the project. There are no plans for new features or feature requests, meaning there are no plans for a new feature release.  Overview  WinJS provides helpers that facilitate the development of Windows Store apps using HTML5 and JavaScript. The library consists of modules and functions that expose the Windows Runtime in a way that is consistent with JavaScript coding conventions. WinJS makes it possible to add Windows UI controls in HTML. This is accompanied by support for data binding and a template engine. Other JavaScript frameworks, such as JQuery, can work side-by-side with WinJS. The library comes with additional declaration files for a rich developer experience using TypeScript, a strict superset of JavaScript with annotations. TypeScript enables for code completion and refactoring while maintaining compatibility with JavaScript.

In one surviving letter, Margarete refers to Himmler as the \\"LandsknechtThe Landsknecht were mercenary soldiers in the German and other continental European armies in the 16th and 17th centuries. Historian Andrew Morrall claims that the ‚Äò‚ÄôLandsknecht‚Äô‚Äô represented for Germans in particular, the \\"exemplum of a race of men, free, natural, and courageous\\". See: Andrew Morrall, \\"Soldiers and Gypsies- Outsiders and Their Families in Early Sixteenth Century German Art\\", in Artful Armies, Beautiful Battles: Art and Warfare in Early Modern Europe, by Pia F. Cuneo, ed. Pia F. Cuneo, History of Warfare (Boston: Brill, 2002), p. 160. with the hard heart\\" but she was nevertheless impressed by his romantic style of writing and his sincere love for her.Himmler's letters to his wife were discovered in Israel and reported by the newspaper Die Welt and in an opinion of an expert from the Bundesarchiv (German Federal Archives) are without a doubt, authentic. Verschollene Briefe Heinrich Himmlers aufgetaucht, In: Die Welt on 24 January 2014 on welt.de\\"Ich fahre nach Auschwitz. K√ºsse, Dein Heini\\" , on: msn.com on 26 January 2014 The blonde, blue-eyed nurse Margarete corresponded perfectly to Himmler's ideal woman. Seven years his senior, Margarete shared his interest in herbal medicine and homoeopathy, and was part owner of a small private clinic. They shared an excessive propensity for efficiency, neatness, longed for strict domesticity, and both preferred a parsimonious lifestyle. From Himmler she received a consistent diet of anti-Semitism and diatribes against Communists and Freemasons. Her anti-Semitism was evident in a letter to Himmler dated 22 June 1928, in which she made disparaging remarks about the co-owner of the private clinic in Berlin, gynaecologist and surgeon Bernhard Hauschildt, exclaiming, \\"That Hauschildt! Those Jews are all the same!\\" Heinrich and Margarete married in July 1928. Initially, Heinrich struggled with the decision to reveal his relationship with Margarete to his parents, partly due to her being seven years older, but also because she was a divorcee, and foremost, because she was a Protestant. None of Himmler's family members attended the wedding, so Heinrich‚Äôs groomsmen were the father and brother of the bride. Ultimately, Himmler's parents accepted Margarete, but the family kept their distance from her and remained that way throughout the length of the relationship. The couple had their only child, Gudrun, who was born on 8 August 1929; they were also foster parents to Gerhard von Ahe, the son of an SS officer who had died before the war. Margarete sold her share of the clinic and used the proceeds to buy a plot of land in Waldtrudering, near Munich, where they put up a prefabricated house. Himmler was constantly away on party business, so his wife took charge of their efforts‚Äîmostly unsuccessful‚Äîto raise livestock for sale. After the Nazis seized power in January 1933, the family moved first to M√∂hlstrasse in Munich, and in 1934 to Gmund am Tegernsee, where they bought a house. Himmler later gained a large house in the Berlin suburb of Dahlem free of charge as an official residence. The couple now saw each other rarely as Himmler became totally absorbed by work. Gebhard, Heinrich Himmler's older brother, characterized Margarete as a \\"cool, hard woman with extremely delicate nerves who radiated no warmth at all and spent too much time moaning\\" who had in spite of these characteristics, been an \\"exemplary housewife\\", one who devotedly loved Heinrich and remained true to her husband.Cited by Christina Wittler: Leben im Verborgenen.

Wer war was vor und nach 1945 (\\"The Cultural Encyclopedia of the Third Reich. Who was What before and after 1945\\"). Frankfurt am Main: S. Fischer, 2007, p. 248. . Due to Himmler's enormous responsibilities, the relationship with Marga was strained. The couple did unite for social functions; they were frequent guests at the home of Reinhard Heydrich. Margarete saw it as her duty to invite the wives of the senior SS leaders over for coffee and tea on Wednesday afternoons. Despite her best efforts and the fact that Margarete was married to the Reichsf√ºhrer-SS, she remained unpopular in SS circles. Former Hitler Youth leader Baldur von Schirach wrote in his memoirs that Heinrich Himmler was constantly \\"henpecked\\", essentially had zero influence at home, and had to yield to Margarete‚Äôs will.Baldur von Schirach: Ich glaubte an Hitler. Mosaik-Verlag, Hamburg 1967, p. 213. During the Nuremberg Rally in 1938, Margarete had conflicts with most of the wives of the highest-ranking SS leaders, who as a group refused to take any directions from her. According to Heydrich's biographers and historian Robert Gerwarth, Lina Heydrich harbored a \\"violent dislike\\" of Margarete Himmler, which was probably reciprocated. After the war, Lina Heydrich made disparaging comments to a reporter from Der Spiegel. Margarete was described as a \\"narrow-minded, humorless, blonde-haired woman\\" who suffered from agoraphobia.Lina Heydrich, c.(1950) in the Journal Der Spiegel, speaking about Margarete Himmler. Cited from: Katrin Himmler: Die Br√ºder Himmler. Eine deutsche Familiengeschichte. S. Fischer, Frankfurt a.M. 2005, p. 237; Context, parts cited and parts paraphrased from Gerwarth, Heydrich, p. 83. Hedwig Potthast, Himmler's young secretary starting in 1936, became his mistress by 1939. She left her job in 1941. Himmler fathered two children with her: a son, Helge (born 1942) and a daughter, Nanette Dorothea (born 1944 at Berchtesgaden). Margarete, by then living in the town of Gmund am Tegernsee in Bavaria with her daughter, learned of the relationship sometime in 1941. Margarete and Himmler were already separated, and she decided to tolerate the relationship for the sake of her daughter. Second World War Once World War II began, Margarete helped operate a military hospital affiliated with the German Red Cross. By December 1939, she was supervising the Red Cross hospitals in Military District III (Berlin- Brandenburg). In this position, she led missions into the territories and countries occupied by the German Wehrmacht. In March 1940, Margarete recorded a business trip to German-occupied Poland, so she was certainly a witness to events there. In her journals, written while serving, Margarete wrote, \\"Then I was in Posen, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and Warsaw. This Jewish rabble, Polacks, most of them don't look like human beings and the dirt is indescribable. It's an incredible job trying to create order there.\\" For her efforts, Margarete reached the rank of colonel in the German Red Cross.Christina Wittler: Leben im Verborgenen. Die Witwe des ‚ÄûReichsf√ºhrers SS‚Äú Heinrich Himmler Margarete Himmler (1893‚Äì1967) In: B√§rbel Sunderbrink (Hrsg.): Frauen in der Bielefelder Geschichte, Bielefeld 2010, p. 198 In February 1945, in writing to Gebhard Himmler, Margarete said of Heinrich, \\"How wonderful that he has been called to great tasks and is equal to them. The whole of Germany is looking to him.\\" Himmler was close to his first daughter, Gudrun, whom he nicknamed P√ºppi (\\"dolly\\"); he phoned her every few days and visited as often as he could. Hedwig and Margarete both remained loyal to Himmler. Margarete and Heinrich Himmler last saw one another in April 1945, sharing time together with Gudrun at their Gmund residence.Oliver Schr√∂m, Andrea R√∂pke: Stille Hilfe f√ºr braune Kameraden. Christoph Links Verlag, Berlin 2002, , p. 106f. Post-war Margarete Himmler (left) with daughter Gudrun in Allied internment during the Nuremberg Trials in Nuremberg, 24 November 1945 In 1945, Margarete and Gudrun left Gmund as Allied troops advanced into the area. After the invasion of Bolzano, Italy, by the U.S. Army in May 1945, Margarete and Gudrun were arrested. They were held in various internment camps in Italy, France, and Germany. During her internment, Margarete was interrogated, but it became clear that she was not informed of the official business of her husband, and was described as having a \\"small-town mentality\\" which persisted throughout her questioning. In September 1945, Margarete Himmler was again interrogated, but this time it was during the Nuremberg trials. Margarete and Gudrun were then detained at the Flak-Kaserne Ludwigsburg internment camp.Christina Wittler: Leben im Verborgenen. Die Witwe des \\"Reichsf√ºhrers SS\\" Heinrich Himmler Margarete Himmler (1893‚Äì1967) In: B√§rbel Sunderbrink (Hrsg.): Frauen in der Bielefelder Geschichte, Bielefeld 2010, p. 193 Since they were not accused, she and Gudrun were released in November 1946 from internment. They took refuge for a time with the Bethel Institution of Bielefeld. Margarete's stay there was expressly endorsed by the Executive Board of the Bethel Institution, but this was not without controversy. On 4 June 1947, in the European edition of the New-York Tribune, an article appeared entitled, \\"Widow of Heinrich Himmler Lives Like a Gentlewoman\\".Christina Wittler: Leben im Verborgenen. Die Witwe des \\"Reichsf√ºhrers SS\\" Heinrich Himmler Margarete Himmler (1893‚Äì1967) In: B√§rbel Sunderbrink (Hrsg.): Frauen in der Bielefelder Geschichte, Bielefeld 2010, p. 197 Margarete was categorized in 1948 at Bielefeld as a lesser offender (Category III) and was to be denazified accordingly. In 1950, Margarete retained a lawyer to challenge this classification, since she claimed that her early Nazi Party membership was no more than \\"nominal\\" and that her high rank resulted from her early service with the German Red Cross, in which she had served since 1914. Margarete maintained that while she had been the wife of the Reichsf√ºhrer-SS, she remained far from the spotlight. Nevertheless, the denazification committee in Detmold revised her classification, and contended that she likely supported the goals of the Nazi Party and endorsed the actions of her husband. Her lawyer insisted during the follow-on appeals process that Margarete could not be held responsible for the actions of her husband, and countered that the official decision was guided by the idea of Sippenhaft, which meant she was responsible by familial connections. On 19 March 1951, she was finally classified as Mitl√§ufer (Category IV). According to this judgment, she was not to be held accountable for the crimes of her husband, despite that she had not been distant from them. Additional arguments were presented that she and her daughter had benefited from the rise of her husband. Because of this, another denazification proceeding, started by the Bavarian Prime Minister Hans Ehard, resumed in the British occupation zone. These proceedings focused on the unresolved question of ownership of Margarete and Heinrich‚Äôs home in Gmund. On 15 January 1953, at the final hearing against Margarete in Munich, she was classified as a beneficiary of the Nazi regime and thus placed in Category II (Activists, Militants, and Profiteers, or Incriminated Persons/German: Belastete), and sentenced to 30 days' special/punitive work. She also lost her pension rights and the right to vote.Christina Wittler: Leben im Verborgenen.

Gudrun left Bethel in 1952. From the autumn of 1955, Margarete lived with her sister Lydia in Heepen. Her adopted son Gerhard also lived with them in her apartment.Christina Wittler: Leben im Verborgenen.

Margarete‚Äôs final years were spent with her daughter in Munich.Ernst Klee: Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. S.Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2007, p. 248. Gudrun emerged from the experience embittered by her alleged mistreatment and remained devoted to her father's memory. Assessment Peter Longerich notes that Margarete Himmler probably did not know about the official secrets or planned projects of her husband during the Nazi era. She said after the war she did not have any knowledge of Nazi crimes, but she remained a committed National Socialist and was certainly anti-Semitic.Christina Wittler: Leben im Verborgenen.

Built in 1907 by the Boston and Maine Railroad, it is a surviving reminder of the importance of the railroad to the development of Alton Bay as a summer resort community. The building, now in use as a community center, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The former Alton Bay Railroad Station is located near the southern end of Alton Bay, a finger extending southward from the main body of Lake Winnipesaukee that is its southernmost extent. It is located on a narrow strip of land with the bay to the east and New Hampshire Route 11 to the west. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and shingled exterior. The western facade historically faced the tracks of the Boston and Maine Railroad. The roof on this side hangs over a recessed porch, which is supported by square columns and large wooden brackets. The lower portion of the walls on this side are finished in wainscoting, and there is a projecting bay at the center where the stationmaster's office was located. The north and east sides of the building are sheltered by a shed-roof porch that was added by the railroad during the station's period of active service. The interior, although it has been extensively altered, retains some original features, including beadboard ceilings and walls, and most of the features of the original restroom spaces. Railroad service was introduced to Alton Bay by the Cocheco Railroad in 1851, introducing steamship service on the lake at the same time. This use of Alton Bay as a transfer point led to the community's development, both for through passengers and as a destination in its own right. The Cocheco's line was eventually taken over by the Boston and Maine, by lease in 1863 and by purchase in 1892. This station was the third built on the site, the first two having succumbed to fire. The station continued to be a major transit point, even after it ceased to be the railroad endpoint, with service extended to Lakeport in 1890. Train service to Alton Bay was ended in 1935, and the town purchased the building two years later. It was converted into a community center in 1957.

In her later years she was known for her mime roles. Early life Gerd Elly was born in Oslo, Norway on 19 February 1921. Her father, Leonard, was a civil servant.Arnold Haskell, \\"Turner, Harold (1909‚Äì1962)\\", rev. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 22 March 2014 Career In the late 1930s, Elly came to London to study with Margaret Craske, and Antony Tudor, the first British ballet expert to recognise her skills. She joined Tudor's London Ballet in 1938, founded after he broke with Ballet Rambert. In 1938, Tudor created two roles for Larsen, Canonetta in Soir√©e Musicale and the French ballerina in Gala Performance. Elly first danced with Sadler's Wells Ballet (now The Royal Ballet) in 1944. This was the same year that she married the ballet star Harold Turner becoming his second wife. Now Gerd Larsen, she was later promoted to soloist in 1954. Sir Frederick Ashton noted her stage presence even in nearly static roles, casting her as Hera, in his 1951 Tiresias, and as Demeter is his 1961 Persephone. Back in 1960, Larsen had been selected by the Russian former prima ballerina Tamara Karsavina to be personally coached to play this mime role, for a revised staging of the ballet. In 1965, Larsen created the role of Nurse in Kenneth MacMillan's Royal Ballet production of Romeo and Juliet to the music of Sergei Prokofiev. The ballerina Deborah Bull remembers Larsen as one of the \\"resident teachers\\" at the Royal Ballet. The others being Brian Shaw, Alexander Agadzhanov, and Elizabeth Anderton. Bull particularly admired Larsen's ability to introduce mime into the ballet. Larsen was a widow with one child and she met the successful writer Rebecca West and her husband Henry Maxwell Andrews after she had performed Swan Lake one evening. Henry became obsessed with Larsen and he would refuse to travel with his wife. He stayed in London to be with Larsen. Rebecca West initially considered this to be purely her husband's infatuation, but she came to think that Larsen was also driven by money. Henry was in his seventies and his life and marriage were ending (he died in 1968). Larsen and Henry's wife were amongst the mourners at the funeral, even though Larsen had only known him for eighteen months. Henry's will left ¬£5,000 for Larsen. In a Royal Ballet career lasting over fifty years, Larsen made her final appearance at Covent Garden in arguably her best-known role, that of Berthe, mother of the eponymous heroine in Giselle, on her seventy-fifth birthday. Personal life Larsen was married to the British dancer Harold Turner from 1944 until his death in 1962. They had one child together, a daughter, Solveig, in 1952.

Guggenheim the legal rights to all of his paintings and any future works he created. The play triggered a retrospective of Bauer's work at the Weinstein Gallery in San Francisco.Kimberly Chun, \\"The Realm of the Spirit: A Retrospective of Rudolf Bauer\\" San Francisco Chronicle, 12 March 2014  Plot  They say art is the freedom of expression. A painting should hold no boundaries, no musts and don'ts but simply put into colors and shapes anything that flashes through a mind. But what happens in the collision between the need for the artful substantiation of thoughts and ideas, and the earthly materialistic notion of money? For whom is art created and what happens when the artist is no longer the owner of his art? These are questions that are handled and mangled through the 90 minutes of heated and reflective dialogue that constitutes this play. The characters slowly work through the troubles of money and art as a business as well as the personal problems and dilemmas of their past and present lives. Bauer is the story of a painter who does not want to paint, the despair it brings on him and his wife and the latter's bold decision to try to make things right by bringing in a lost love with whom Bauer has unresolved issues after her involvement in making Bauer sign the contract from which all his unhappiness springs. Starring only three actors this play proceeds into the depths of greed, betrayal, love and the freedom of painting, but, also the freedom of refusing to do so.  Characters  * Rudolf Bauer: The tortured title character who battles the urge to paint with the feeling of not being able to do so because of the position he is in of no longer owning what he creates. * Louise Bauer: Bauer's caring wife who in a last desperate attempt to make her husband paint again invites his ex-lover Hilla Rebay to their home. * Hilla Rebay: Bauer's long gone German lover who started a relationship with Guggenheim and made Bauer sign the contract giving up his art. = Original cast = * Ronald Guttman as Rudolf Bauer * Stacy Ross as Hilla Rebay * Susi Damilano as Louise Bauer References External links *Profile of Rudolf Bauer by Karole Veil, Solomon R.

Krivenko v. The Register of Deeds, City of Manila (G.R. No. L-630) was a landmark case decided by the Philippine Supreme Court, which further solidified the prohibition of the Philippine Constitution that aliens may not acquire private or public agricultural lands, including residential lands. The decision was promulgated on November 15, 1947. This was the outcome of the petition by Alexander Krivenko, a Russian citizen, who bought a residential land in Manila, Philippines on December 1941. However, he failed to register the same due to Japan's declaration of war. Later on in May 1945, he again sought the registration of the same land but the herein respondent, Register of Deeds, denied the application because as an alien, Krivenko was disqualified to own land pursuant to the laws of the Philippine jurisdiction. Krivenko brought the case to the Court of First Instance of Manila which sustained the refusal of the Register of Deeds of Manila. He then appealed to the Supreme Court. During the pendency of the appeal, a new circular by the Department of Justice was released, instructing all registers of deeds to accept for registration all transfers of residential lots to aliens. With the effect of the circular swaying in his favor, Krivenko thereafter filed a motion to withdraw his appeal. However, the Supreme Court deemed it best to exercise its discretionary powers and denied Krivenko's appeal, in order to tackle the more pressing constitutional issue; and in the process, established itself as a landmark case with regard to foreign ownership of lands in the Philippines. Issues There are two material issues in this case. * The first involves the substantive issue of whether or not a conveyance of a residential land to aliens infringes Section 5, Article XIII of the Constitution. ::The above-mentioned provision of the 1935 Constitution provides, to wit: > * On the other hand, equally relevant is the procedural issue of whether or > not Krivenko's Motion to Withdraw Appeal should be granted. ::It is the > position of the Court that the granting the motion would result to Krivenko > winning the case not by a decision on the merits but because of the circular > of the Department of Justice. Ruling The Supreme Court deemed it wise to > tackle the more important constitutional issue rather than merely give way > to the procedural aspect of Krivenko's appeal. The Court convened for days > as to what course of action to take, and in the end voted in denying the > motion withdrawing the appeal. Borrowing the words of the penned Supreme > Court decision: > The 1935 Commonwealth Constitution served as the main point of reference in > this case; the following facts however, should be noted: # The 1943 > Constitution was already in place at the time this case was penned in 1947 # > Krivenko bought the property in December 1941 # The dispute about the > registration and the denial of such by the register of deeds occurred in May > 1945. # Section 1, Article XIII of the 1935 Constitution was reproduced > verbatim in Section 1, Article VIII of the 1943 Constitution =Dissecting > Section 1 of Article XIII (1935 Constitution)= The discussion delved into > the definition of the term, ‚Äúpublic agricultural lands.‚Äù The court made > reference to Section 1, Article XIIIof the 1935 Constitution as the > springboard for its discussion. > The provision refers to the lands of the public domain as falling under > three distinct categories: Agricultural, Timber and Mineral lands. It should > be clear that lands of the public domain are by the State first and > foremost, but its utilization is limited to Filipino citizens only, or to > corporations whose 60% capital stock are owned by Filipinos. It is clear > from these phrases that the bent towards excluding foreigners is already > evident. > Applying statutory construction, it would be appropriate to apply the > Doctrine of Necessary Implication. This doctrine is explained in the book of > Agpalo: It thus is clear that public agricultural land is not within the > contemplation of inalienable natural resources. Public agricultural land is > thus alienable. The term 'alienable', taking root from 'alienation', is > described under Act 2874 of 1919 to mean ‚Äú‚Ä¶any of the methods authorized by > this Act for the acquisition, lease, use or benefit of the lands of the > public domain other than timber or mineral lands.‚Äù Act 2874 is likewise a relevant piece of legislation in this discussion, because it compiled the laws relative to the lands of the public domain. Under this act, Agricultural Land is also synonymous to: Alienable or disposable. =Definition of Public Agricultural Lands= What then are the categories of land falling under ‚ÄúPublic Agricultural Land‚Äù ‚Äì those lands which are exclusively alienable and disposable? The Supreme Court made reference to various laws and cases, such as the 1908 case of Mapa vs. Insular Government (10 Phil., 175, 182), the Public Land Act (No. 926), Commonwealth Act 141, among others. The general tenor of those references is that agricultural land does not really refer to a literal use for agricultural purposes, but as to its ‚Äúsusceptibility to cultivation for agricultural purposes.‚Äù A technical term whose usage was known and understood by lawmakers and by the Constitutional Commission during that period, it basically referred to lands not falling under timber or mineral, and thus includes residential lands. Equally telling was the opinion of Secretary of Justice Jose Abad Santos to a 1939 query as to the interpretation of the term in question. The Supreme Court gave great weight to the later Chief Justice's opinion, to wit: > =Rounding out the Prohibition against Foreign Ownership= Seeing as how > Article XIII section 1 limits the alienation of public agricultural lands to > Filipino citizens, this may easily be circumvented by a simple transfer from > a Filipino citizen in favor of an alien. Thus, Section 5 of the same > constitution addresses this explicitly. > When Sections 1 and 5 are read together, it is therefore clear that aliens > are prohibited from acquiring lands in the Philippines, subject to > exceptions provided by law. The penned decision referred to the > Constitutional Convention, specifically the report of the Committee on > Nationalization and Preservation of Lands and other Natural Resources, for > the purpose behind the principle: > This is further supported by the CA 141, which blocked out the right of > aliens from acquiring property by reciprocity; previously granted them by > the Public Land Act No. 2874 sections 120 and 121. The Supreme Court > affirmed the act of the Register of Deeds in denying the registration of > Krivenko's land, and established itself as a landmark case when addressing > the issue of foreign ownership of lands within the jurisdiction of the > Philippines. Jurisprudence The case of Nicolas and Sinforoso Mercado > against Benito Go Bio began as a suit ‚Äúbrought in the Court of First > Instance of Manila (civil case No. 55449), to annul a contract of sale and > another of lease on two parcels of land with improvements thereon, on the > ground that the deed of sale purporting to convey to the defendant the > parcels of land and improvements is not a sale with the right to repurchase > but a mortgage to secure the payment of a loan.‚ÄùMercado v Bio, G.R. No. > L-1183, October 19, 1953 A settlement was agreed upon on that case on June > 24, 1940. An execution of judgment was filed by Bio and Mercado based on > their right to repurchase the property offering to pay for his liabilities > which Bio rejected, claiming that the right to repurchase had already > expired. Plaintiffs in this case raised the constitutional question because > Bio is a Chinese citizen. The court reiterated the ruling as established in > Krivenko, stating: > The case of Halili v CA once again highlighted the importance of this case, > thus stating: ‚Äúthe landmark case of Krivenko vs. Register of Deeds settled > the issue as to who are qualified (and disqualified) to own public as well > as private lands in the Philippines.‚ÄùHalili v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. > 113539, March 12, 1998 However, the issue at hand involved the subsequent > sale from an alien to a qualified Filipino citizen. Jurisprudence is > consistent that \\"if land is invalidly transferred to an alien who > subsequently becomes a citizen or transfers it to a citizen, the flaw in the > original transaction is considered cured and the title of the transferee is > rendered valid.\\" The court thus held that the selling and acquisition of a > Filipino citizen of land improperly transferred to a foreign national is > thereby cured because the purpose of the lawmakers, as gleaned from the > Krivenko ruling, of keeping the land to Filipinos is thereby upheld. It can > be seen here that not only the ruling made in Krivenko is considered by > subsequent jurisprudence but discussions made therein as well. The Krivenko > doctrine has a far reaching application and unless subsequently overruled, > remains to be a controlling doctrine in Philippine jurisprudence. Public > Impact A little over two months after the promulgation of the decision by > the Court on the Krivenko case, the implication of the ruling is made > apparent by a subsequent case. The court narrated in Cabauatan et al. v Hoo > Cabauatan et al v Hoo, G.R. No. L-2207, January 23, 1951 that: > On March 18, 1943, plaintiffs sold to Uy Hoo, married to By Siat, and Siy > Hong, a widow, all Chinese citizens tivo parcels of residential land > situated in the City of Manila, Philippines, which were formerly described > in Transfer Certificate of Title No. 63967, in consideration of the sum of > P13,000 in Japanese war notes. In view of said transfer, the Register of > Deeds of the City of Manila cancelled Transfer Certificate of Title No. > 63967 and issued in lieu thereof Transfer Certificate of Title No. 69938 in > the name of the purchasers. On November 15, 1947, the case of Krivenko v. > Register of Deeds, G. R. No. L-630 was decided by this Court holding that a > conveyance of a residential land to aliens infringes Section 5, Article XIII > of the Constitution. As a result, on December 15, 1947, plaintiffs demanded > from the defendants to restore to them the lands above-referred to on the > ground that the sale they made thereof to the defendants was null and void, > but the latter refused to do so. Hence the plaintiffs brought this action on > January 14, 1948, seeking the annulment of the sale above-mentioned. The court in that case said that the Krivenko doctrine does not apply because at the time of the contract of sale was executed on 1943, the Philippines was under Japanese occupation thus the Constitution of the Philippines, political in nature, being the basis of the Krivenko ruling, was not in force at that time. Hence, the Krivenko doctrine was not yet used by the court although the court still denied the application of the plaintiffs for declaration of nullity of the contract of sale because of their ‚Äúguilty knowledge‚Äù in contracting an illegal sale. This ruling in Cabauatan v Hoo was further reaffirmed by courts in subsequent proceedings seeking to annul a contract of sale made during the Japanese occupation and depending on the Krivenko doctrine.

Po Poe L-2943, October 30, 1953; Talento and Talento vs. Makiki, et al., 93 Phil., 855. =Exceptions= Eugene MossIn Re: Application for Registration of Land. Eugene Moss, G.R. No. L-27170, Nov 22, 1977 appealed from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Leyte denying his application for the registration of a ten-hectare island on the ground that, being an American citizen or an alien, he is disqualified to acquire lands under section 5, Article XIII of the 1935 Constitution following the decision in Krivenko v Register of Deeds. The case involved Calumpihan Island acquired by Moss on January 20, 1945, from Rufino Pascual. On March 27, 1962, Moss was proclaimed its sole owner. On April 3, 1965, Moss, through Dr. Teodorico H. Jaceldo, his administrator and attorney-in-fact, filed an application for the registration of the said land. Moss is a retired army colonel, an American citizen, and a resident of Texas, USA. The court reversed the denial of registration made by the trial court clarifying the prohibition made on Krivenko. The court held that ‚Äúwhile aliens are disqualified to Acquire lands under the 1935 Constitution, citizens of the United States can acquire lands like Filipino citizens.‚Äù Thus, while Krivenko laid down the ruling to prohibit all aliens or those of foreign nationals from acquiring agricultural land in the Philippines, an exception was made in the form of the Ordinance appended to the 1935 Constitution by Resolution No. 39 of the National Assembly dated September 15, 1939, hereinafter provided for: > Clearly, while Krivenko laid down the foundation for prohibition on aliens > acquiring land in the Philippines, it is not an absolute ruling and admits > of exceptions.

First elected as a Republican in 2012, Simmons won a third two-year term in the general election of 2016, where he defeated for the second time Democrat Alex Mendoza of Lewisville, Texas. Mendoza ran unsuccessfully against Simmons in the 2012 general election as the nominee that year of the Green Party. Simmons lost his bid for a fourth term in the general election held on November 6, 2018. He polled 28,567 votes (48.9 percent) to 29,894 (51.1 percent) for his Democratic opponent, political newcomer and local business owner Michelle Beckley. Background The son of public school teachers, Simmons was raised in southern Arkansas. He studied at Southern Arkansas University. Simmons is married to the former Lisa Dickson. After several years of marriage, the couple left Arkansas in 1985 and settled in Dallas, where he completed his Bachelor of Business Administration degree at Dallas Baptist University. In 1991, Simmons co-founded Retirement Advisors of America from which he recently retired as its Chairman of the Board. Retirement Advisors of America manages nearly $3.0 billion in assets for families across the country and was acquired in 2020 by Allworth Financial out of Sacramento, CA In 2010, Simmons was named by D Magazine as one of the top financial advisors in the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex. The trade publication Investment News has named Retirement Advisors of America among the top thirty financial advisors in the United States. Currently Simmons is the Senior Distinguished Fellow for Right on Work at Texas Public Policy Foundation, a bi partisan conservative think tank in Austin, Texas.

He is a supporter of the Liberty Institute, which seeks to protect the sanctity of human life, religious liberty, and traditional marriage. He served as the Vice Chairman of the national board of directors for the [Autism Society of America and a life member of the National Rifle Association. Political life When long-term Republican Representative Burt Solomons of North Carrollton declined to seek a tenth term in 2012, Simmons, who had no previous political experience, entered the primary election to nominate a successor candidate. With 4,844 votes (61.6 percent), he handily defeated two intraparty rivals, David Edmund Loerwald (born c. 1956) of Carrollton, with 1,754 votes (22.3 percent), and Michael Hugh \\"Mike\\" Hennefer (born c. 1952) of Carrollton, a California native and an active figure in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, with 1,260 votes (16 percent). In the higher-turnout general election on November 6, 2012, Simmons won with 31,386 votes (59.1 percent) to 20,481 votes (38.6 percent) for the Democrat Gary E. Brown and Alex Mendoza's 1,224 votes (2.3 percent). Simmons served on the House committees of (1) Appropriations, (2) Transportation, and (3) Local and Consent Calendars. In 2017, Simmons obtained House passage, 88-57, of his bill to abolish \\"one-punch\\" straight-ticket voting in Texas, a procedure no longer allowed in 42 other states. With a straight ticket, a voter pulls one lever or touches one computer square to vote for all nominees of the same party. Most of the opponents of the legislation are Democratic, though straight-ticket Republican voters have constituted the majority statewide since at least 1996. Instead the Democrats claim the legislation would disenfranchise some elderly, disabled, or minority group voters. Simmons said that his intent is to encourage voters to make selections down ballot, including proposition and tax measures, instead of concentrating on a few offices at the top of the ticket.Julie Chang, \\"Texas House would end straight-ticket voting,\\" San Antonio Express-News, May 7, 2017, p. A8. Simmons won his third term in the state House in the November 8, 2016, general election. He defeated the Democrat Alex Mendoza, 34,418 votes (56.3 percent) to 26,759 (43.7 percent).

He also co-sponsored companion legislation to increase medical and licensing requirements of abortion providers, a measure which opponents claim could lead to the closure of certain abortion clinics in Texas. These issues brought forth an unsuccessful filibuster in the Texas State Senate by Wendy R. Davis of Fort Worth, who in 2014 was the Democratic nominee for governor. The Texas Right to Life Committee rated Simmons as high as 90 percent in 2017 and as low as 67 percent in 2018. In 2018, NARAL Pro- Choice Texas gave Simmons a 0 rating.

The legislation requires TxDOT to \\"score' each project on an objective scoring system and select those projects which score the highest and are therefore of greatest need to Texas. Simmons also joint authored legislation with Chairman Joe Pickett to increase funding for transportation. Simmons, a long time advocate for individuals with disabilities, passed legislation to require health plans in Texas to cover testing for Autism at an early age and continue coverage for Applied Behavioral Therapy and other treatments for Autism. Simmons inserted an amendment in a bill by Representative Chris Paddie R- Marshall governing ride sharing companies such as Uber and Lyft, that require ride sharing companies to begin pilot programs for providing rides to the disabled in the same manner and time frame as non disabled riders.

Simmons voted against term limits for certain state officials. =Interest group ratings= In 2017, the Young Conservatives of Texas scored him 82 percent. The Texas League of Conservation Voters rated him 50 percent in 2013 and 43 percent in 2015.

From 1968 to 1990 he was the team doctor of East German sports club SC Dynamo Berlin, and from 1971 was an unofficial member of the East German Ministry for State Security (Stasi) under the alias J√ºrgen Wendt. After the reunification of Germany, Pansold worked for Austrian Sports Centre in Obertauern as the medic for all winter sports athletes. In 1998 Pansold was convicted by the Landgericht Berlin for the doping of underage persons in nine cases, which led to a fine; Pansold was then released by the Austrian Ski Association (√ñSV) from his position. Since 2003 Bernd Pansold has been active working for Red Bull GmbH as the director of the company's own Diagnostic- and Training center, in which professional athletes associated with the company Red Bull are attended to.http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/iteam/daily-news-investigates-red-bull- diagnostics-training-center-austria-blog-entry-1.1632404 Activity in East Germany Bernd Pansold was hired in 1968 from the Stasi supported sports club and only four years later was promoted to Deputy Head of Performance Medicine. In 1982, he became the Head of the Dynamo Sports Medicine. In his function Pansold was responsible for various doping practices. In 1975, he was responsible for the distribution of recipes for doping products to doctors who were under his guidance.Giselher Spitzer: Doping in der DDR.

Dynamo were exempt from the police and the Stasi under the regime. Under his rule the other team doctors of lower rank would follow in a militant fashion. He is the main culprit for doping in Berlin sports, especially at Dynamo.Hajo Seppelt, Holger Sch√ºck: Anklage: Kinderdoping, Tenea-Verlag, Berlin 1999, page 149 According to former secret Stasi-documents and testaments of witnesses regarding Pansold, he had been involved in the creation of the State lead doping program in the early seventies. The application of anabolic Steroids as well as Pansolds involvement in the research group \\"Zus√§tzliche Leistungsreserve\\" (English: Additional Performance Reserve) at the Forschungsinstitut f√ºr K√∂rperkultur und Sport (FKS) in 1975 had come to light, in which the enhancement and optimization of anabolic doping was intended. In that same year Pansold himself reported in one of his IM-reports titled \\"fl√§chendeckende Anwendung anaboler Steroide an Teilnehmer der Zentralen Kinder- und Jugendspartakiade\\" (English: Widespread use of anabolic steroids to participants of the Central Children's and Youth sports divisions). There are several more recollections and reports of his self composed reports about training- and competition doping at World championships and Olympic games, amongst others such products as the State sponsored VEB Jenapharm produced sexual hormone Testosterone as well as Amphetamines such as Pervitin, which were distributed to female athletes as well.

Unlike his fellow doctors Pansold remained silent during the procedure regarding the allegations against him. The chamber found Pansold as proven guilty, according to his own accounts in his report \\"Controlling the allocation of virile enhancing strong anabolic steroids to underage swimmers at Dynamo, and there were no milder circumstances to be seen.

At this sports center, Pansold, who was becoming known as a good performance diagnostician, supervised several known top-flight Austrian Winter athletes. Austrian alpine star skier Hermann Maier was a regular at his practice, and the doping allegations which surfaced in 1998 from competitors and the media in his breakthrough year, were largely due to his association with Pansold. Maier however denied ever having close contact to Pansold.Maier dismisses doping rumors, Associated Press from 24. October 1998 The following nationwide attention to Pansolds past involvement with doping, enhanced by the ongoing court cases in Germany, put athletes and officials of Austrian winter-sports under immense pressure, since they were now being accused of working closely with Pansold. √ñSV-President Peter Schr√∂cksnadel publicly disputed ever to have worked with Pansold. In 1998 the √ñSV then made their utility of the Performance center Obertauern dependent on the dismissal of Pansold, which followed shortly thereafter. The media however accused the √ñSV of not taking necessary action until sufficient public attention was brought to the matter.DDR-Doping war, √ñSV-Distanz ist, Der Standard from 7.

When the company was critically questioned about the hiring of Pansold, the company stated that Pansold was one of the world's leading performance diagnostician and sports doctors, and that Dr. Pansold was unchallenged in his correctness and integrity according to his medicinal circles and the Red Bull staff and athletes. Pansold himself added that doping was a thing of the past from the time of the Cold War. Mateschitz himself also expressed that he felt as though what Pansold was involved with in East Germany was a thing of the past.Ex-Doping-Arzt Pansold betreut Red-Bull-Asse, Wirtschaftsblatt from 24.

October 2011 The S√ºddeutsche Zeitung concluded, after a meeting of journalists with Pansold in Thalgau where he refused to answer questions regarding his past, that there are former athletes of the DDR, who are either sick today or who have had disabled children, due to the pills they were given by Pansold in their youth, and that you cannot hold it against them that they find it harsh and cynical that Pansold continues to be allowed to happily continue in his career as a doctor considering their condition.Der steirische Zeus, S√ºddeutsche Zeitung from 19. May 2010 It is noteworthy that several notable athletes attend the Diagnostic- and training center to different degrees, to be treated or advised, such as German sports stars Maria Riesch and Sebastian Vettel, who however dispute and deny having ever had any contact with Pansold who is the leader of the operation.

Architecture  Consisting of 11,000 square meters, this unique building is the first of its kind to be built in India with its colored fa√ßade and unmistakable identity. Designed by architect Abin Chaudhuri, the concept was to insert a burst of color in the city's monotonous dense urban fabric, representing the colors of the sky. To achieve the colors in the glass facade, Vanceva PBB has been used as the sandwich material between two layers of glass. The colored laminate on the fa√ßade follows no repetitive pattern and is symbolic of the unpredictable nature of the sky. It also represents the vibrancy of today's youth. An integrated plaza with a water body has been designed. The water body receives no direct sunlight and creates a comfortable micro-climate. Wherever possible shading trees have been planted on the hard landscape and soft landscape has been introduced.

In 1853 Zetteler moved the family to Madison and opened a general store. The mother and children ran the store and the father worked for official offices of the State, including the Secretary of State of Wisconsin and the State Register of Deeds, and Peter worked in the office of former Governor Leonard J. Farwell. In 1858, a fire destroyed all of the family's property, and Zetteler returned to Milwaukee and went into the real estate business. Peter married Tyistke (original Dutch spelling: \\"Tjitske\\" Tillema (called \\"Mary\\") on May 3, 1859.http://content.mpl.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/MCMC/id/5714 Marriage certificate, Peter Fagg and Tyistke Tillema; Milwaukee County records They moved to Alto in Fond du Lac County in 1861, where he worked as a retail clerk in a general store. Fagg was elected a justice of the peace in Alto, and county supervisor for the same place, in 1862, and re-elected. In 1863 his stepfather was elected (as a Democrat) to the State Assembly back in Milwaukee. Fagg was appointed as a prison guard in the Wisconsin State Prison in 1865; then returned to Milwaukee in 1867, where he was appointed a police officer under Chief William Beck. He became a deputy sheriff under Sheriffs Parsons and McDonald, and resigned in October, 1873. He worked as a notary public and debt collector.  Assembly  In 1874 he was elected to succeed fellow Reformer Joseph Hamilton (who was not a candidate) under the label of \\"Democratic Reform.\\" He won with 995 votes, to 451 for Thomas Armstrong, who ran as an \\"Independent Republican\\". He was re-elected the next year as an \\"Independent Democrat\\" (the Reform Party was beginning to break down), with 763 votes to 534 for regular Democrat George Tyre, serving with his stepfather Frederick Zetteler, who had just been elected once again to the Assembly from Milwaukee as a Democrat. Due to the division of the Assembly, no single party could assemble a majority. Fagg was persuaded to support Republican Sam Fifield for Speaker of the House. Fagg switched his vote and his influence, thus enabling the Republicans to control the Assembly. From that time on, he supported the Republican party cause, especially among his fellow Dutch Americans.Keyes, E. W. \\"When Peter Fagg Helped\\" Wisconsin State Journal reprinted in Milwaukee Journal August 26, 1895; p. 4, col. 5 Fagg was not a candidate for re-election in 1876, and was succeeded by Hamilton (now running as a Democrat).  After the Assembly  Fagg became briefly postmaster of the Wisconsin State Senate, then with the help of Republican Governor William E. Smith moved on to a clerical position in the office of the Wisconsin Board of Commissioners of Public Lands, where he remained for nine years. In 1886, he was not reappointed due to his increasingly fervent religious and temperance movement positions. Fagg had been a teetotaler for many years, and increasingly argued that the only acceptable place for him in political matters was as a lecturer for the cause of Prohibition. He became a sale agent for books and Bibles. He was active in a number of fraternal orders, held high office in the Independent Order of Good Templars' Temple of Honor and Temperance and the Knights of Pythias, and for years was a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. By 1895, Fagg was reported to have suffered financial reversals, and to be working as day labor at the Wisconsin State Capitol building.Keyes, \\"When Peter Fagg Helped\\" Fagg died in 1917.

Public were going in procession to Tirunelveli Collectorate to submit a memorandum demanding wage settlement for the tea plantation workers of Manjolai estate. An altercation between the police and the marchers resulted in a lathi charge by police. On 23 July 1999, a large number of labourers from the Tea estates of Manjolai congregated in Tirunelveli and marched towards the Collectorate demanding the release of a number of estate workers, who were arrested earlier for staging protest demanding better wages. The workers were being paid 7px 70 per Day then and they were demanding the pay to be increased to 7px 100. The workers were also demanding maternity leave, periodical breaks for women during the eight-hour-long duty. They were also opposing the decision of the estate owners to force workers to stay in sheds with poor facilities and deny right to rear cattle or even raise Gardens. A large contingent of stone throwing and lathi-wielding police brutally assaulted the protesters forcing them to run towards the river.

A member of the genus Myrmecia in the subfamily Myrmeciinae, M. maxima was first described by George Fletcher Moore in 1842. As no type specimen is available, M. maxima cannot be confidently identified, but the only description Moore had provided undoubtedly describes a large Myrmecia species, having long, sharp mandibles and a formidable sting. It is still classified as a valid species. The ant resides in the south-west regions of Western Australia. As other Myrmecia species have been identified in these regions, M. maxima is possibly a senior synonym of one of these ants. Its former name is recognised as an invalid name after it was suppressed under plenary powers in 1976. Distribution and identity Like almost all Myrmecia species, M. maxima is endemic to Australia. Specifically, the ant lives in the south-west of Western Australia, where other Myrmecia species are known to reside. This includes Myrmecia nigriceps, Myrmecia regularis and Myrmecia vindex. As no type specimen is available, it is difficult to properly identify the species. However, Moore describes the ant in his publication as being one and a half inches long (3.8 centimetres), having very long and sharp mandibles and a formidable sting that produces acute pain. These morphological characteristics (large size, long mandibles and powerful stings) is consistent with most Myrmecia species which are well known ants. Taxonomy and background Before Myrmecia maxima was described, George Fletcher Moore had an interest in the language of the Aborigines and learned it. Shortly after his arrival, he commenced a project to produce a dictionary of the Aboriginal language. Notable figures such as Francis Armstrong, Charles Symmons, John Gilbert and John Hutt, the Governor of Western Australia, helped Moore by assisting him with the vocabulary or helped fund his book. Moore took extended leave in March 1841, returning to England for two years. In 1842, Moore's dictionary was published under the title A Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language in Common Use Amongst the Aborigines of Western Australia. In his book, Moore provided the first official description of M. maxima, which was known as kallili or killal amongst the Nyungar people of Western Australia and referred to by Moore as a \\"lion-ant\\". There, the ant was originally placed in the genus Formica. The description Moore had provided undoubtedly describes a large Myrmecia species, and so it was reclassified by entomologists William Ride and Robert W. Taylor in 1973, and the ant was now known as M. maxima. Under the present classification, M. maxima is a member of the subfamily Myrmeciinae. This subfamily is a member of the family Formicidae, belonging to the order Hymenoptera. As Moore collected no type specimen, M. maxima cannot be properly identified or be placed into any Myrmecia species group. Despite this, M. maxima is still treated as a valid species. The name Formica maxima is only regarded in both editions of Moore's book and two publications written by Rosendo Salvado, a Spanish missionary. In these editions, only its name referred to by the Western Australian Aborigines was mentioned. Due to this and Moore's description that identifies an unknown Myrmecia ant, Taylor and Ride requested that the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) should suppress the name in correlation with the Law of Priority and not the Law of Homonymy. They also proposed that the name should be added to the Index of Rejected and Invalid Specific Names and not be used as a valid name for M. maxima. By 1976, members of the ICZN voted in favour of suppressing the name under plenary powers. If scientists managed to identify M. maxima and a neotype selected in relation to its geographical presence and the only known description provided, the ant may be a senior synonym of M. nigriceps, M. regularis or M. vindex. This is because the taxon name was described much earlier than the three species, and it would have priority in accordance to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. The taxon M. vindex basirufa was a candidate for neotype selection due to the misunderstood and troublesome taxonomic history of M. vindex and M. vindex basirufa, but this taxon was synonymised in 1991.

The plot of the episode sees Drew (Drew Carey) left in a coma after he is hit by a car. Drew entertains himself through a fantasy world he creates, while his friends try various things to get him to wake up. At the end of the episode, Drew chooses whether to go to heaven or not and his sister-in-law, Mimi (Kathy Kinney), goes into labor. The episode was written by Les Firestein and directed by Gerry Cohen. It first aired on February 7, 2001 on the ABC network in the United States. The episode was the first of \\"a two-part event\\" that aired during the February sweeps. Drew's fantasy world featured special effects and appearances from historical figures, Ben Stein and Joe Walsh. The show's theme tune was temporarily replaced with \\"Girlfriend in a Coma\\" by The Smiths. \\"Drew's in a Coma\\" finishing in 26th place in the ratings for the week it aired. Critical response was mostly positive, with reporters calling the plot funny, strange and surreal. Editor John Fuller was recognised for his work on the episode with a Creative Arts Emmy Award nomination. Plot As Drew runs for his bus, he suddenly finds himself flying above Cleveland. He encounters Captain Marvel (John Valdetero), who invites him to a party, and a little boy (Charlie Stewart) who asks him to do somersaults. The scene then cuts to Drew's friends Kate (Christa Miller), Lewis (Ryan Stiles) and Oswald (Diedrich Bader) standing by a comatose Drew's bedside. Oswald shakes Drew to wake him up, while Kate tries shouting and then talking to Drew. Drew's brother, Steve (John Carroll Lynch) and his wife, Mimi (Kathy Kinney), arrive and Mimi kisses Drew, but he still does not wake. While he is in his coma, Drew creates a fantasy world with beautiful women, a pizza tree and a beer fountain. Mimi becomes Drew's slave and she turns on a television screen which shows Drew what is happening at the hospital. The doctor (David Purdham) gives Drew an injection to wake him up, but it does not work, as Drew refuses to leave the coma because he is having fun. The doctor then suggests removing Drew from the respirator, so he will have to fight to come out of the coma or die. Drew's friends surround him with his favourite things, try talking to him again and Ed (Joe Walsh) plays Drew's favourite song. Steve allows the doctor to remove Drew from the respirator and Drew's fantasy world disappears. A heavenly guide (Ben Stein) appears and tells Drew he has passed the test to get into heaven, but he must decide if he wants to go to now or go back to living. As Drew heads towards the light, Mimi goes into labor. Production The episode featured an appearance by Joe Walsh. In January 2001, Drew Carey told The Charleston Gazette's Ellen Gray that during the February sweeps, his character would be going into a coma, while Mimi Bobeck (Kathy Kinney) would give birth to Drew's nephew. Carey said Drew's coma would feature special effects and Dan Doran, a publicist for the show, added \\"When he slips into the coma, he kind of goes into this fantasy world where nothing goes wrong.\\" Terry Morrow from the Daily News thought \\"Drew's in a Coma\\" had a simple concept compared to previous stunt episodes, which the show employed to keep things fresh. Carey said such episodes gave people \\"a reason to watch.\\" The episode was the first of \\"a two-part event\\" and a story arc with long-running consequences for the character. \\"Drew's in a Coma\\" was written by Les Firestein and directed by Gerry Cohen. The fantasy sequences see Drew fly above Cleveland, party with beautiful women, enjoy a \\"pizza tree and beer fountain\\" and play Trivial Pursuit with historical figures William Shakespeare and Abraham Lincoln. Meanwhile, his friends try to save him and the episode ends with a cliffhanger as Drew goes towards the light. However, Morrow wrote that there were no plans to kill Drew off, as Carey had another year to go on his contract. \\"Drew's in a Coma\\" featured guest appearances from actor Ben Stein and musician Joe Walsh. The show's regular theme tune was replaced with The Smiths' \\"Girlfriend in a Coma\\". Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Drew's in a Coma\\" finished in 26th place in the ratings for the week of February 5‚Äì11, 2001. The episode had a Nielsen rating of 9.6, meaning that it was seen by 9.6% of the nation's estimated households. It was the third highest-rated show on ABC that week, following episodes of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and The Practice. The episode received mostly positive attention from critics. David Bianculli from the Daily News gave the episode three stars and claimed that placing Drew in a coma was \\"strange even by 'Carey' standards.\\" However, Bianculli thought the situation was \\"quite funny\\" and used the concept with \\"gleeful abandon.\\" Bianculli concluded that the show had made comas look more fun than they actually are and thought the rap song backed by a harp was a television first. A reporter for the Spartanburg Herald-Journal commented that the episode was funny, despite the premise sounding like it would not be. The reporter liked the sequence inside Drew's head, saying it \\"amounts to a truly surreal escapade.\\" The Cincinnati Post's Rick Bird branded the episode \\"hilarious\\". Joel Brown, writing for The Spokesman-Review, chose the episode as one of his highlights of the day, but the plot made him questioned what had happened to the show. Phil Rosenthal for the Chicago Sun-Times called the premise of the episode \\"over-the-top\\" and realised Drew would not die because of the light script. Ben Doherty from The Newcastle Herald enjoyed the episode, although he thought that it entered \\"pretty soppy territory\\" when Drew's friends gathered around his bedside to decide whether to pull the plug or not. Doherty added \\"Drew transports himself and us to a wonderful fantasy world not dissimilar to something Homer Simpson might dream up.\\" At the 53rd Creative Arts Emmy Awards, editor John Fuller earned a nomination for Outstanding Multi-Camera Picture Editing for his work on the episode.

Though Brodie argues the Elijah-Elisha narratives acted as literary models for the Gospels, Corley says many of Brodie's parallels are weak and unconvincing, such as Brodie's attempt to connect 1 Corinthians 15:3-7 with the theophanies in Numbers 11-17. Corley also notes many major discrepancies between the Elijah-Elisha narratives with Jesus' life, including how only Jesus has birth stories, teachings, and a passion narrative of the last week of Jesus' life that encompasses most of the four Gospels. Corley also notes that John the Baptist, rather than Jesus, is a better candidate for influence of the Elijah-Elisha narratives. Though Brodie emphasizes literary parallels between Jesus and Elijah/Elisha as evidence for complete literary invention, Corley argues that Brodie ignores the fact that most other histories and biographies of the time, such as the works of Thucydides and Herodotus, are combinations of history and literary writing by the author and that one category doesn't disinclude the other.Corley, Jeremy. \\"Beyond the Quest for the Historical Jesus: Memoir of a Discovery.\\" (2014): 177-197.

David. How the Gospels Became History: Jesus and Mediterranean Myths. Yale University Press, 2019, 29-33. Litwa writes, for example, that \\"Like Bauer, however, Brodie tends to make logical leaps from detailed literary parallels to historical dependence. Bauer‚Äôs parallels came from Seneca and Philo. Brodie uses bits and pieces of the Septuagint to reconstruct Jesus‚Äôs life; then he asks us to believe that Jesus‚Äôs life is actually derived from readings of the Septuagint. The parallels are not sloppy but often mind-bending in their complexity. Brodie graphs these parallels in long, maze-like charts\\" (pg. 31).

Repartition of the Aegean islands amongst the conquerors. There are no sources about him until 1207 when he participated in the expedition organized by Marco Sanudo for the conquest of the Greek islands which, three years after the fall of Constantinople to the Fourth Crusade, had not yet been occupied by the victors. He is not to be confused with the 17th-century Andrea Ghisi, from the same family, who devised a game called Laberinto (\\"Labyrinth\\"). According to Andrea Dandolo, Andrea and his brother Geremia received together possession over Tinos, Mykonos, Skyros, Skopelos and Skiathos, and after the division of these possessions among themselves, Andrea obtained Tinos and Mykonos. The two brothers were not vassals of Sanudo's Duchy of Naxos, however, but directly under the Latin Empire. In 1243 he was engaged with his brother in a long dispute with the Republic of Venice. During the campaign of 1207, the island of Andros had been assigned to Marino Dandolo but at an unknown date (probably between 1238 and 1239), Geremia had seized it by force. Dandolo appealed to the Venetian government but died soon after. This, however, did not prevent the Great Council of Venice on 11 August 1243 from condemning the Ghisi brothers to confiscation of their property, and ordering the Doge of Venice Jacopo Tiepolo to force the restitution of the island. Andrea and Geremia were also ordered to present themselves before the Doge and submit to the Council's decision by 29 June 1244, on pain of exile from Venice and the auctioning of their possessions for the benefit of the dispossessed Dandolo family. The Ghisi probably continued their occupation of Andros, as it was more beneficial to them than the Republic's conditions. As Geremia died some time after August 1243, it was Andrea alone who was eventually exiled from Venice and his possessions auctioned off. By 1251, however, both sides softened their stance and Andrea resolved to submit to new and more lenient demands. From the terms of the agreement, it is clear that he was no longer in direct possession of Andros, which may have devolved to a vassal of the Duchy of Naxos. After fulfilling his obligations, on 28 March 1253, his exile was lifted by the Great Council, but the reclamation of his auctioned goods was long-drawn out affair; even in 1280, years after his death, some still had not been recovered. The last information about Andrea Ghisi comes from an act signed in 1266. He had died by 19 March 1277, when his son Bartholomew appears as lord of Tinos and Mykonos. Apart from Bartholomew, Andrea had six sons (of which only one Marino, survived him) and one daughter, Anfelise, who married Pietro Querini.  Family  Andrea Ghisi had a sister (Agnese Ghisi) and a brother (Geremia Ghisi).

He painted a St Phillip in Ectasy for the Oratory of the Fillipini,St Phillip in Ectasy now in the Duomo of Palmanova. and also painted for the church of the Carit√† in Udine. He returned to Udine from Vienna after breaking a limb in a fall from a scaffold.Cenni biografici dei letterati ed artisti friulani dal secolo IV al XIX. by Francesco Di Manzano, page 70.Encyclopedia Treccani, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 30 (1984), entry by Aldo Rizzi. Style Not much is known about Cosattini's early career. One of his few remaining works is the altarpiece of the church of Charity of Udine. It is a painting of the Holy Family. The painting has been dated to 1659. The painting reflects a link to Padovanino and, to some extent, Palma il Giovane, leading to the conjecture that Cosattini had at some point been an apprenticeship of the two painters or that he had closely followed their work and adopted it into his own style. Cosattini's close stylistic ties with Padovanino are further demonstrated in the seven paintings, thought to be made by Cosattini, that cover the main hall of the Uccellis College of Udine.

The group performed vocal music, music accompanied by an orchestra, and music for social dancing, later transforming to a private social club. It was one of the most popular singing groups in Chicago. History The group was originally formed in 1865 by Otto Lob to perform songs while the body of Abraham Lincoln lay in state in Chicago before being buried in Springfield. When the group formally organized later that year as Germania M√§nnerchor, Lob was elected as its first conductor. By 1868 the group had voted to make Hans Balatka, who had previously been a member and conductor of the Philharmonic Society, an honorary member. Lob and some members of Germania Mannerchor split and formed the Concordia music society. The two groups maintained a rivalry, producing a number of high quality productions of operas such as The Magic Flute (by Concordia) and Der Freischuetz and Stradella (by Germania M√§nnerchor). Each of the choruses had over a hundred members. The group performed in locations ranging from the short-lived Crosby Opera House to open air productions. The group was part of a widespread tradition of local ethnic music and social groups across the United States during the 19th Century with ensembles of the same name existing in Baltimore, Maryland, Washington, DC, New York, Saginaw, MI, and Evansville, Indiana. The Chicago-based Germania M√§nnerchor participated in the 1867 Nord-Amerikanischer S√§ngerbund held in Indianapolis, performing the works of Franz Abt under the baton of Balatka. In 1871, Balatka left to join the Liederkranz, and was replaced by Julius Fuchs. The Concordia chorus merged back with Germania Mannerchor in 1873. In 1875, they performed a concert with Theodore Thomas directing. Henry Schoenefeld became the conductor in 1879. Of the number of choral societies in Chicago that existed prior to 1871, only the Germania Mannerchor was still in existence as of 1893. In 1889, the group built the Germania Club Building on Germania Place in the Near North Side of Chicago. It produced a catalog of the 500 books in its library and a 1903 Yearbook in German. The club purchased German related architectural items to furnish the club, including an 18 foot tall section of Manufacturer's Building from the World's Columbian Exposition which had been made by a German porcelain company and 18 inch tall wooden panels that measured up to 11 feet long decorated with intricate carvings of scenes from Wagner's operas that had originally been created for a Chicago mansion. With the anti-German rhetoric that accompanied American entry into World War I, the group changed its name to the Lincoln Club in 1917. It became the Germania Club in 1928. The group evolved from a choral ensemble that collected books and material relating to the German experience in America, to an almost purely social club which developed a reputation as one of the leading private clubs of Chicago. The club disbanded in 1986. Notable members Notable members have included: *Fred A.

Background \\"Overs\\" was one of many songs completed during the duo's sessions with John Simon, alongside \\"Fakin' It,\\" \\"Save the Life of My Child\\" and \\"Punky's Dilemma\\". The song concerns an old couple beginning to tire of one another. In their 1968 appearance on Kraft Music Hall, Simon explained that \\"Overs\\" is a companion piece to their earlier composition, \\"For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her\\"; that song concerns the belief in true love, while \\"Overs\\" relates to the loss of that belief. It has been suggested that the song, which was originally written for but cut from The Graduate (1968), was inspired by the film‚Äôs depiction of two lovers (the Robinsons) in a loveless marriage. The lyrics contain almost no rhyme. Composition \\"Overs\\" is a departure from Simon‚Äôs earlier work in that it reveals \\"increasing independence from standard diatonic, major/minor, and/or modal rock- and folk-based styles.\\" As a result, it \\"displays a logical consequence of both of these trends: a more jazz-oriented style,\\" including a larger selection of chords and looser form. The song contains multiple instances of wordplay related to the word over, including the final line, \\"I stop and think it over.\\" The sound effects at the start of the song are of somebody striking a match to light up and inhale a cigarette.

The multimedia project was the result of interviews with over 60 Harvard undergraduate students holding signs bearing messages about the experiences of black students at Harvard. Background From 2010 through 2014, Harvard's admissions of minorities (blacks, Latinos, and Asian-Americans) have ranged between 43% and 45.6%. As of 2014, African Americans make up 9.4% of the approximately 7,500 undergraduates at Harvard. Origin Kimiko Matsuda-Lawrence, a Harvard undergraduate, created the multimedia project and campaign as an independent study project (under the direction of Professor Glenda Carpio during the fall of 2013) that interviewed minority students about their experiences at Harvard. They reported feelings of alienation about the Harvard campus, being the lone black student in some classes, or feeling uncomfortable about comments and social interactions with other students on campus. Matsuda-Lawrence reported that students made comments such as \\"I've never told anyone this before\\" or \\"I've never been able to talk about this.\\" The students comments were kept anonymous and she used them to write a play. To promote the play, she assembled a group of students to help create the multimedia project that appears on Tumblr. The Tumblr project consists of photos taken of students holding signs with racially insensitive and offensive remarks by peers and response they would like to make. Examples of signs included \\"No, I will not teach you how to 'twerk'\\" and \\"Don't you wish you were white like the rest of us?\\" Aims and response The project and campaign aim to the personal experiences of minority students at Harvard, especially those that have left them feeling alienated at the university. By March 6, 2014, a link on BuzzFeed had produced over a million views. In an email to undergraduate students, Donald Pfister, interim dean of Harvard College, expressed support for the project and said: \\"Harvard is also about inclusion. This photo campaign, based on a play which will premiere Friday night, is a great example of students speaking about how we can become a stronger community. 'I, Too, Am Harvard' makes clear that our conversation about community does not and should not stop.\\" Spread to other universities and colleges Student organizers at Harvard reported messages of support from other universities such as Yale University, Duke University, the University of Pennsylvania, McGill University and University of Oxford. Inspired by \\"I, Too, Am Harvard\\" campaign, minority students at McGill University, the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge are developing similar multimedia campaigns.

Content Doc of the Dead looks at the zombie genre in film, literature and pop culture as a whole.

The name was later changed to Heroes, after Nelson and his production team decided that the original name could deter some conservative sale outlets to carry the album.

It was located on Berkner Island on the Filchner Ice Shelf. At the time of its inauguration it was Argentina's southernmost permanent base. It was shut down in 1984 over safety concerns due to it being built on increasingly unstable ice, which endangered both personnel and equipment. History On 8 January 1980, launching the second stage of the 1979‚Äì80 austral summer campaign, the Argentine Navy's new icebreaker ARA Almirante Ir√≠zar sailed away from Buenos Aires with the mission of founding a new base on Berkner Island, on the Filchner Ice Shelf. On 24 January 1980 and after a sixteen-day-long trip, the ship reached the chosen place, about west of the spot occupied by Belgrano I, by then already abandoned because the ice platform it was placed upon was cracking at a fast rate, resulting in unsafe working conditions. Belgrano III was officially inaugurated on 30 January after finishing unloading of cargo with the aid of two Puma SA 330 helicopters from the Argentine Army Aviation Command. At this time it hosted a nine-men Argentine Army complement. Belgrano III was shut down after 4 years of continuous service due to the fast deterioration of the ice barrier it was sitting on; new, often hidden cracks and crevices endangered the on-duty personnel and material. The base was closed on 15 January 1984 and all of its staff was evacuated by a helicopter operating from Almirante Ir√≠zar. Due to a mix of very bad weather and mechanical failure of the second helicopter aboard Almirante Ir√≠zar, of packaged equipment had to be left behind to be recovered by land or, if not possible, in a later summer campaign. The salvage of such equipment was further delayed for several campaigns because of unusual pack ice thickness and other transport and logistic setbacks. On 1989 a helicopter inspection showed that the base and packages were already completely buried in snow and ice deep; only the antennae were sticking out in the surface. Description The initial facilities at Belgrano III were composed of nine mobile modules coupled together and mounted on continuous tracks. They were constructed of plastic material, which provided structural strength and thermal insulation at the same time, necessary features to withstand the rigorous winds and freezing temperatures prevailing in the area. In addition the base had a cubicle mounted on skis. These facilities were assigned to staff accommodation, communications station, infirmary, meteorological station, kitchen, bathroom and power plant. A freezing chamber was built in the ice, and some deposits were installed directly on the ground. =Scientific activities= Besides the usual equipment and facility maintenance duties, personnel at Belgrano III carried out various scientific projects regarding meteorology, geomagnetism and topographic surveys on the area.

The event was intended to be a harmless fundraising publicity stunt, but the balloons drifted back over the city, Lake Erie, and landed in the surrounding area, and caused problems for traffic and a nearby airport. The event also interfered with a United States Coast Guard search for two boaters who were later found drowned. In consequence, the organizers and the city faced lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in damages, and cost overruns put the event at a net loss. Preparations Terminal Tower overlooking Public Square The stunt was coordinated by Balloonart by Treb, a Los Angeles-based company headed by Treb Heining, which spent six months preparing for it. A rectangular structure the size of a city block, measuring by and rising three stories high, covered with a one-piece net of woven mesh material, was set up to hold the balloons, on the southwest quadrant of Public Square in Cleveland. Inside the structure, 2,500 students and other volunteers spent many hours filling the balloons with helium. United Way originally planned to release two million balloons, but eventually stopped at over 1.4 million. Children sold sponsorships to benefit United Way at the price of $1 for every two balloons. Launch On Saturday, September 27, 1986, with a rainstorm approaching, organizers decided on an early release of the balloons at about 1:50 p.m. EDT. Close to 1.5 million balloons rose up from Cleveland's Public Square, surrounding Terminal Tower and surpassing a world record set the previous year on the 30th anniversary of Disneyland. Consequences Typically, a helium- filled latex balloon that is released outdoors will stay aloft long enough to be fully deflated before it descends to Earth. However, the Balloonfest balloons collided with a front of cool air and rain and dropped towards the ground, still inflated, clogging the land and waterways of Northeast Ohio. In the days following the event, balloons were reported washed ashore on the Canadian side of Lake Erie. Two fishermen, Raymond Broderick and Bernard Sulzer, who had gone out on September 26, were reported missing by their families on the day of the event. Rescuers spotted their boat anchored west of the Edgewater Park breakwall. A Coast Guard search and rescue helicopter crew had difficulties reaching the area because of the \\"asteroid field\\" of balloons. A search-and-rescue boat crew tried to spot the fishermen floating in the lake, but Guard officials said balloons in the water made it impossible to see whether anyone was in the lake. On September 29, the Coast Guard suspended its search. The fishermen's bodies subsequently washed ashore. The wife of one of the fishermen sued the United Way of Cleveland and the company that organized the balloon release for $3.2 million and later settled on undisclosed terms. Balloons landing on a pasture in Medina County, Ohio, spooked Louise Nowakowski's Arabian horses, which allegedly suffered permanent injuries as a result. Nowakowski sued the United Way of Cleveland for $100,000 in damages and settled for undisclosed terms. Burke Lakefront Airport had to shut down a runway for half an hour after balloons landed there.

Ticketfly grossed $500 million in 2013, processing 11.2 million tickets for more than 80,000 events across Canada and the United States. After raising $37 million from investors such as Sapphire Ventures (formerly SAP Ventures), Mohr Davidow Ventures, and High Peaks Venture Partners, Ticketfly competed against Ticketmaster with cheaper tickets and social media capabilities for promoters. In 2012, they managed ticket distribution for 360 venues across the country and tripled that number in three years to more than 1,100 venues by 2015. On October 7, 2015, Ticketfly announced its acquisition by music streaming service Pandora in a $335 million cash and stock deal to complement the company's core streaming product. CEO Brian McAndrews explained that it would leverage Ticketfly and Pandora's \\"engaged\\" user base to \\"thrill music lovers and lift ticket sales for artists as the most effective marketplace for connecting music makers and fans.\\" On June 9, 2017, Pandora sold Ticketfly to its largest competitor, Eventbrite, for $200 million. On May 31, 2018, Ticketfly confirmed that its services were the subject of a major security breach that compromised \\"some client and customer information\\", and that the site had been taken offline as a precaution to investigate. The site briefly contained a message by \\"IsHaKdZ\\" which claimed responsibility for the hack, and threatened to release an internal database used by the site's back-end for event organizers. In early June 2018, Ticketfly said that the breach included 26 million users, and included data about their names, addresses, and phone numbers. In November 2018, it was announced that Ticketfly would be shut down, with music-oriented features to be merged into Eventbrite.

Life Born in Ross, Herefordshire, Adshead worked as an estate agent and merchant. He settled in Manchester around 1820.Alan Powers, 'Architects I Have Known': The Architectural Career of S. D. Adshead, Architectural History Vol. 24, (1981) , pp. 103‚Äì123, at p. 120 note 15. Published by: SAHGB Publications Limited. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1568402 In 1835 he was part of the consortium developing Victoria Park, Manchester. He was declared bankrupt in 1839, described as a \\"wholesale hosier\\". In 1839 also, he went onto the Council of the Anti-Cornlaw League. In 1838 the Night Asylum, a homeless shelter in Henry Street, Manchester, was founded by Adshead and George Wilson of the League, and Adshead continued to act as its treasurer. In 1840‚Äì1 Adshead was involved with the British India Society, and moved in abolitionist circles. He became secretary of a branch, the Northern Central British India Society, after a visit to Manchester by Joseph Pease. He had worked with George Thompson at the end of 1840 to see its journal The British Indian Advocate issued.Anna M. Stoddart, Elizabeth Pease Nichol (1899), p. 111 and pp. 122‚Äì3; archive.org (1) and archive.org (2). He was in the US shortly afterwards, calling on James and Lucretia Mott in Philadelphia on 16 February 1841.Anna Davis Hallowell (ed.), James and Lucretia Mott: Life and Letters (1884), p. 194; archive.org. In March he sailed back from Boston, where he knew William Lloyd Garrison, with a letter destined for Elizabeth Pease. Adshead was one of the defendant directors in the landmark case Foss v Harbottle (1843) 67 ER 189, which established the precedent that where a wrong is alleged to have been done to a company, the proper claimant is the company itself. Adshead became a member of Manchester Corporation, serving as Alderman for St. Anne's Ward.William E. A. Axon (ed.), The Annals of Manchester: a chronological record from the earliest times to the end of 1885 (1886)p. 283. He also took up public causes in the health sector. He supported the Health of Towns Association, and homoeopathy. He advocated the rebuilding out of town of the Manchester Lunatic Asylum, in the early 1840s when its future was in play. At the end of his life he was lobbying for a convalescent hospital in the Manchester area. He died on 15 February 1861, at Withington. He was a correspondent of Florence Nightingale, a contact through Richard Cobden, and after his death she wrote in a letter that he was \\"my best pupil\\". The Bottle, George Cruikshank's set of eight temperance engravings, was dedicated to Adshead.Wilfrid Hugh Chesson, George Cruikshank (1908), p. 256;archive.org. Works Exchange Ward, Manchester, from Joseph Adshead's Twenty-Four Illustrated Maps of the Township of Manchester (1851) =Prisons= *Prison Discipline: The Fallacies of The Times (1844) As a penal reformer, Adshead supported the system of Francis Lieber, and defended the separate system. In Prisons and Prisoners (1845), he described the Eastern State Penitentiary. This work also contained an attack on the views of prisons expressed by Charles Dickens. Adshead argued, influentially, that what Dickens had written in his American Notes (1842) on the \\"Pennsylvania system\\" was fiction, and could not be taken seriously as commentary. He also characterised the Eighteenth Annual Report of the Board of Managers of the Boston Prison Discipline Society (1843) on the matters at issue as a \\"flagrant instance of trickery\\". A sequel was Our Present Gaol System Deeply Depraving to the Prisoner and a Positive Evil to the Community: Some Remedies Proposed (1847).

The focus of PSP programs is to connect class assignments, content, and readings with contemporary public issues. Students are then asked to participate with members of the community in various forms of public sphere discourse and democratic participation such as town hall meetings and public debate events. Through these events, students are challenged to practice civic engagement and civil discourse. __TOC__ Theoretical foundations =Public sphere theory= Public sphere pedagogy is theoretically grounded in J√ºrgen Habermas' conceptualization of the public sphere. In his seminal work The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, Habermas envisioned the public sphere as an inclusive discursive space in which the citizens of a society gathered, discussed, and debated over the issues of the day. Habermas argued that the European bourgeois public sphere that emerged in eighteenth century coffee houses and salons represented an idealized form of the public sphere. Individuals engaging in discussion in these spaces would share and debate their views with one another. Habermas argues that this dialectic encounter was a critical part of one's social life where individuals, as part of a larger public, could construct public opinion through critical rational discourse. Habermas argued that these discussions served to fill the gap between the state and the people by creating what he called a \\"civil society\\". Further, Habermas argued that a functioning public sphere was critical to maintaining a healthy democratic order and deliberative democracy. This traditional notion of a face-to-face public sphere has evolved with the invention of online technologies. The public sphere no longer requires a physical setting, but can manifest in cyberspace. The coffee house discussions idealized by Habermas have expanded to blogs, discussion forums, and online videos. Henry Giroux in particular discusses the role of new media in the public sphere and public pedagogy. However, scholars debate whether computer- mediated communication in an online setting actually constitutes a functioning public sphere or just a public space. Applications =The Town Hall Meeting= Town Hall Meetings are one way public sphere pedagogy has been integrated into curriculum. This event began at California State University, Chico in 2007. Classes participating in the Town Hall event require students to research and write about controversial issues. Students then come together with classmates, students from other classes, faculty, and community members. During the Town Hall Meeting, participants move into breakout sessions to share their work and engage in discussions about their topics. Faculty and community members moderate these discussions, share expert insight, and move students toward further development of their work. Students participate in interactive poster displays at the Shasta College Great Debate =The Great Debate= The Great Debate also uses public sphere pedagogy as its foundation. This event started at California State University, Chico in 2010 and has since been implemented at Butte College, Shasta College, and Chabot College. The Great Debate requires students from a variety of classes to research and write about a controversial theme. These themes have ranged from water and agriculture to mental health. The event is open to the public. Students give individual and group presentations, engage in formal debates, break out into discussion sessions, and display interactive poster presentations. Community members and public officials also participate as moderators, discussion leaders, and debaters. Unlike the Town Hall Meetings, which usually take place on campus property, the Great Debate is hosted in public spaces including City Council Chambers and public libraries. =The Student Voices program= Student Voices programs are a type of civic engagement initiative that have been implemented in several high schools in the United States. The curriculum has high school students research and complete classroom assignments on current issues in government and candidates in local elections. Students then connect with outside communities via the digital public sphere and engage in moderated \\"Speak Out\\" events. Student Voices programs have been successfully implemented in curricula in Seattle and Pennsylvania school districts. Critiques Public sphere pedagogy inherently is subject to many of the criticisms of Habermas' conception of the public sphere. Chief among them is the traditionally exclusionary nature. The bourgeois public sphere, as introduced by Habermas, has been characterized as highly patriarchal, and oblivious to the existence of female and plebeian styles of discourse. The concern here is that as a model of the bourgeois public sphere, applications of public sphere pedagogy might alienate students and community members unaccustomed to this type of dialectic experience. In addition to its exclusionary nature, attention has also been called to Habermas' privileging of a hegemonic public sphere. Michael Warner argues that the bourgeois public sphere was structured to be affable to those privileged few who made up the powerful upperclass. While students participating in public sphere pedagogy application receive special training in their classrooms, the same is not necessarily true of community members who participate. This specialized student training draws two critiques. First, conceiving of public pedagogy as a form of instruction risks erasing the plurality that is central to being a public. Training individuals how to be \\"good\\" citizens prescribes action in a way that limits the scope of politics and the public sphere. Second, conceiving of public pedagogy as a form of learning risks eclipsing politics with education. Turning political and social issues into learning problems individualizes the issues instead of making them the responsibility of the public.

The M/V Samish rounds Lopez Island, heading for Anacortes from Friday Harbor. Taken from the M/V Hyak.The MV Samish is the second vessel of the Olympic-class auto ferries built by Vigor Industrial for the Washington State Ferries system. The vessel started service with her maiden voyage to Friday Harbor as the #3 Boat in the San Juans on June 14, 2015.  History  Funding for a second Olympic-class was authorized in the spring 2012 session of the Washington State Legislature and the keel laying and first weld took place on March 8, 2013. The name Samish was decided by the Washington State Transportation Commission on November 13, 2012 (the same day of the naming of the ) after a public outreach process. The vessel is named after the Samish Indian Nation, a Coast Salish tribe whose name means ‚Äúgiving people‚Äù. On December 21, 2013, the ship's superstructure was rolled out from Nichols Brothers Boat Builders and sent to Seattle on December 23 to be joined with the hull which was under construction at the Vigor Shipyards. The Samish was accepted by Washington State Ferries on April 10, 2015 and was officially christened on May 20 in Anacortes. The ship underwent two months of sea trials and crew training before entering service on the Anacortes/San Juan Islands route at the start of the Summer 2015 sailing season on June 14 at 9:05am sailing from Anacortes to Friday Harbor. The Samish is also listed as one of the 10 Best Passenger Ships of 2015 (the year she was launched), on Marine Log.  Routes  The Samish is assigned to the Anacortes-San Juan Islands route. She has also served on the Mukilteo- Clinton, Edmonds-Kingston, and Seattle-Bremerton routes. The Samish was assigned to the Mukilteo-Clinton route on 7/15/2019.  Incidents  The Samish was pulled from service on February 21, 2016, after the discovery of a quarter-sized hole in the hull below the water line, later found during a drydock inspection to be linked to corrosion. The ferry was re-entered service on March 10 after some minor patchwork. On August 7, 2017, the Samish was removed from service due to a problem with the number two drive engine, causing the Anacortes/San Juan Islands route to be operated on an emergency four boat schedule until a replacement boat entered service.  Numbers and Ship Recognition  The Samish has three numbers used to identify it. The first is her IMO Number. The Samish's IMO Number is 9720251. Her MMSI (Marine Mobile Service Identity), 367649320. Her Radio Call Sign WDH7552. The Samish is owned by Washington State Ferries, a branch of the Washington State Department of Transportation. She is US Flagged, and listed as an AIS Passenger Vessel.

It was named in honour of the Hungarian entomologist Alexander Mocs√°ry, curator of the Hungarian Natural History Museum. It is native to forests in parts of tropical South America. Description The head of Eulaema mocsaryi has a central raised ridge and both head and thorax are clad in short velvety black hairs. The colour of head and thorax is mainly black. The legs are black and hairy and the tibial joints of the hind legs are wide and compressed. The dark-coloured abdomen is densely covered with short tawny- yellowish hairs, becoming paler towards the tip of the abdomen. Distribution Eulaema mocsaryi is native to the forests of Colombia, Surinam and the Amazon basin in Brazil. Ecology Female Eulaema mocsaryi with laden pollen baskets approaching flower of Brazil nut Eulaema mocsaryi has been seen visiting the flowers of Solanum toxicarium and Polygala spectabilis. The male has a mutualistic relationship with the orchid Cattleya eldorado, from which it obtains fragrances which it stores in cavities in its hind legs. Research was undertaken to identify which insects pollinated the flowers of the Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa). It was found that a number of species of bee did so and that Eulaema mocsaryi was one of the most frequent visitors and played an important role in pollination, visiting several flowers on each tree and moving from tree to tree. The researchers concluded that for successful pollination to take place in commercial Brazil nut plantations, the plantations needed to be surrounded by intact primary forest with its epiphytic orchid population to supply the other needs of these orchid bees.

Originally composed of Guf, Princip aka Prince, Slim aka Slimus, Ptaha aka Zanuda. In 2008 the group was the winner of the MTV Russia Music Award for Best Hip Hop Project. The group Centr is the founder of the ¬´–¶–ê–û Records¬ª label. After Guf left Centr in 2009, rumours about the group‚Äôs breakup began to appear. In 2010 at the ‚ÄúRussian Street Awards‚Äù the category for the \\"Biggest Hip-Hop Event of the Year\\" in Russia, \\"the Collapse of the group Centr\\" was chosen. From 2009 - 2012, the group included just Slim and Ptaha. In 2014, after a 5 year hiatus, it was announced that the group would be re-established. On May 14, 2016, the group played their last show in Frankfurt am Main, Germany and officially announced their disbandment. All of the members of the group continue to release solo projects. History The group was formed in 2004 in Moscow, Russia by rappers Guf aka Rolexx and Princip aka Prince. Originally they wrote an unofficial album, \\"–ü–æ–¥–∞—Ä–æ–∫\\" (Podarok / Gift), but only 13 copies of it were made and the rappers gifted it to their friends for the New Year. In 2002, Alex Dolmatov also professionally known as Guf, started working on his first album, \\"–ü–æ–¥–∞—Ä–æ–∫\\" (Podarok / Gift). It was released in 2005. In 2006 Guf, Slim & Ptaha wrote down the songs, \\"–ú—É—Ç–Ω—ã–µ –ó–∞–º—É—Ç—ã\\" (Mutnye Zamuty / Cloudy Trafficking), and \\"–ñ–∞—Ä–∞ 77\\" (\\"Heat 77\\") specially for the movie \\"Heat\\". At the end of 2006, members of Centr created a label \\"–¶–ê–û records\\"; where the group called ‚ÄòDymovaya Zavesa‚Äô including rapper Smoky Mo released the album - \\"–≠—Ç–∞–∂–∏\\" (Etazhi / Floors). In 2007 Guf released his first debut album \\"–ì–æ—Ä–æ–¥ –î–æ—Ä–æ–≥\\" (\\"Gorod Dorog\\" / \\"City Of Roads\\"). In Russia it was recognized as the one of the best albums of the year. On October 25, 2007 the group Centr released its debut album \\"Kacheli\\" (–ö–∞—á–µ–ª–∏ / Swings). Princip, the co-founder of the group came out of prison and after his release wrote down the songs, \\"–ñ–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–æ–µ –Ω–µ–±–æ\\" (Zheleznoe Nebo / Iron Sky), and \\"–ò—Å–ø–æ–≤–µ–¥—å\\" (Ispoved' / Confession) ft. Centr. All the songs were included in their debut album \\"–ö–∞—á–µ–ª–∏\\" (Kacheli / Swings). In 2007 Guf and rapper Basta were the ones to write a second soundtrack, for the movie \\"–ë–æ–π —Å —Ç–µ–Ω—å—é 2: –†–µ–≤–∞–Ω—à\\" (Bou‚Äô S ten'yu 2: Revansh /Shadowboxing 2: Revenge\\") the track was titled, \\"–ú–æ—è –∏–≥—Ä–∞\\" (My Game / Moya Igra). On September 9, 2008 the group performed on the Day of the Actor Broadcast on A-One (TV channel). The group Centr, together with rapper Basta won the award \\"MTV RMA\\" for the song, \\"City Of Roads\\" from their debut album \\"Kacheli\\" (–ö–∞—á–µ–ª–∏ / Swings) In 2008 Centr released their second album, \\"–≠—Ñ–∏—Ä –≤ –Ω–æ—Ä–º–µ\\" (Broadcast‚Äôs Normal / Efir V Norme). The main themes of the project were Moscow streets, drugs and police. In 2008 the group became the main headliner of the 1st day of the International Splash Festival!, in Russia carried out in Moscow in a big skatepark called \\"Adrenaline\\", the event was organized by Phlatline. In the summer of 2009 Princip was arrested again. In June that same summer, rapper Guf left the group. The rapper declared his departure in an infamous interview. At the end of 2009 rapper Slim released his debut album \\"–•–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–æ\\" (Holodno / Cold) and a music video to the track of the same name. In October 2009, Ptaha aka Zanuda released his debut album \\"–ù–∏ –æ —á–µ–º\\" (Ni o chom / About Nothing). In December 2009, Guf released his second album \\"–î–æ–º–∞\\" (Doma / Homes). On January 7, 2010 Ptaha aka Zanuda in a interview declared the group‚Äôs disintegration. However, despite that, Centr tours (now just as Slim & Ptaha aka Zanuda) proceeded as planned. After the dissolution of the group the music video for the song, \\"–õ–µ–≥–∫–æ –ª–∏ –±—ã—Ç—å –º–æ–ª–æ–¥—ã–º\\" (Legko li byt' molodym / Is being young easy) was released. It was released because under the terms of the contract with the record label, Centr was supposed to record two music videos for their second album \\"–≠—Ñ–∏—Ä –≤ –Ω–æ—Ä–º–µ¬ª (Efir v Norme / Broadcast‚Äôs Normal). Each participant of the group were recorded separately, at different times and in different places so they didn't see each other (though Slim and Ptaha often crossed and hung out). On November 3, 2011 after long transfers and collaborations, a collaboration album between a young music group called ‚Äò–õ–µ–≥–µ–Ω–¥—ã –ü–†–û‚Äô (Legediu Pro/ Legends PRO) and the remaining members of Centr was in the works. The album was titled, \\"–õ–µ–≥–µ–Ω–¥—ã –ü–†–û... Centr\\" (\\"Legends PRO(about)‚Ä¶ Centr\\") and was finally released to positive critical reception. The simple album title is actually a careful wordplay on words, because \\"Pro\\" (\\"professional\\") also means \\"About\\" in Russian - so the title can be read as either \\"Legends PRO... (&) Centr\\" or \\"Legends (ABOUT) Centr\\". In March, 2012 at the Hip-Hop Award Stadium ‚ÄúRUMA 2012‚Äù the album \\"Legends PRO‚Ä¶ Centr\\" won the \\"Album Of the Year\\" and rapper Slim also won the nomination for \\"Rapper Of the Year\\". In October 2014, rap.ru (one of the biggest rap-sites in Russia; similar to XXL in the US), published an interview http://www.rap.ru/reading/20051 with all of the three original members of Centr - Guf, Slim & Ptaha who after three years started recording together again. In 2015 Centr as Guf, Slim & Ptaha have gone on a Russia-wide Concert tour. On September 21, when performing in Krasnoyarsk, Russia; Guf and Slim were arrested after the show and charged for \\"usage of drugs\\". A serious crime in Russiahttp://lifenews.ru/news/162211 however both were released on September 27 with no further charges pressed.http://www.interfax.ru/culture/469524In 2016 Centr recorded their latest album ¬´–°–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–∞¬ª (Sistema / The System). In 2017 Guf & Slim came together to form the duo ‚ÄòGuSli‚Äô and released 2 albums together. On June 15, 2017 they released the album ‚ÄúGuSli‚Äù. On November 17, 2017 they released the second ‚ÄúGuSli II‚Äù album. The artists came up with the names for both albums by combining the first letters of both artists pseudonyms.

The earliest known family likely to have owned Grougar were the De Morvilles who were there in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries before the reign of Robert the Bruce. The De Morvilles originated in Morville, Department of Manche, Normandy, arrived in England in the wake of the Norman Conquest, settled in Burg, Cumbria, and later moved to Scotland in the early 12th century where they were granted land in Ayrshire. This land grant precedes the establishment of the Register of the Great Seal of Scotland so cannot be positively confirmed. Hugo de Morville who died in 1202 was the Constable of Scotland. By the late thirteenth century the Logan family were barons of Grougar. Thorbrand de Logan baron of Grougar is recorded in 1272 and a John de Logan of Grugar may be the John Logan described as ‚Äòone of the king of England's enemies‚Äô in 1307 during the Wars of Independence. History The lands and barony of Grougar can be traced in the Register of the Great Seal of Scotland as from 1315. The earliest reference occurs between 1315 and 1321 when King Robert the Bruce granted a charter to Sir Robert Cunningham of the lands of Lambrachton and of Grugar in Cunningham [RGS.I.53].Registrum magni sigilli regum Scotorum ‚Äì The Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, Volume 1, Entry 53. Grougar remained in the hands of the Cunningham family until 19 January 1479 when Robert Cunningham resigned the lands of Grugar, which with the lands and barony of Snawde, the lands of Westbarns, lands of Carale, and the lands of Grugar, were incorporated into the lands and barony of Grougar, Ayrshire, by King James III and granted to Sir Robert Logan [RGS.II.1411].Registrum magni sigilli regum Scotorum ‚Äì The Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, Volume 2, Entry 1411. Grougar had returned into the hands of its former owners the Logans a long established Ayrshire family and remained with them until the late sixteenth century. The principal branch of the family was the Logans of Restalrig near Edinburgh. One of its most prominent members was Sir Robert Logan of Restalrig who married Katherine Stewart, daughter of King Robert II of Scotland, and in 1400 became Admiral of Scotland. On 18 May 1490, King James IV, granted Sir John Logan, son and heir apparent of Robert Logan of Restalrig and his wife Isabell, the lands of Grougar in the lordship of Cunningham, Ayrshire [RGS.II.1951].Registrum magni sigilli regum Scotorum ‚Äì The Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, Volume 2, Entry 1951. On 2 January 1540, King James V granted Robert Logan, son and heir apparent of Sir Robert Logan of Restalrig, the lands and barony of Restalrig, and the lands and barony of Grougar with its mill etc. in the bailliary of Cunningham, which Robert Logan the elder and his wife Lady Elizabeth Hume had resigned, to be incorporated in the free barony of Restalrig [RGS.III.2056].Registrum magni sigilli regum Scotorum ‚Äì The Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, Volume 3, Entry 2056. The Register of the Great Seal of Scotland records that on 13 August 1540, King James V granted Robert Logan, son and heir apparent of Sir Robert Logan of Restalrig, the lands of Grogar with its mill, tenantries, etc., in the lordship of Cunningham [RGS.III.2188].Registrum magni sigilli regum Scotorum ‚Äì The Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, Volume 3, Entry 2188. Sir David Hamilton expanded the family's landholdings and accompanied King James V on his matrimonial voyage to France when he married Magdalene daughter of King Francis I of France. When the Earl of Hertford invaded Scotland in 1544 the town and castle of Preston was destroyed. Later Sir David was created Knight Banneret and Marischal Deputy of Scotland. Sir David also is noted as an early adherent of Protestantism in Scotland. He married Janet Baillie and they had 13 children of whom George, the eldest succeeded. However, by the late sixteenth century Grougar was in the hands of a branch of the Graham family. The Grahams also are of Anglo-Norman origin who settled in Scotland in the early twelfth century during the reign of King David I of Scotland. On 18 February 1581 King James VI confirmed a charter by Robert Graham of Knockdolian allocating certain land within the barony of Grougar to Thomas Lyon of Glamis and his wife Lady Agnes Gray [RGS.V.111].Registrum magni sigilli regum Scotorum ‚Äì The Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, Volume 5, Entry 111. Robert Graham seem to have owned lands within the barony of Grougar by 1581 and ten years later the complete barony was his as on 3 March 1591 King James VI granted, for good service, the lands and barony of Grougar with its mill etc., in the bailliary of Cunningham, to John Graham of Knockdolian and his wife Lady Helen Kennedy [RGS.V.1834].Registrum magni sigilli regum Scotorum ‚Äì The Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, Volume 5, Entry 1834. On his death John Graham of Knockdolian passed Grougar to his brother Robert according to an entry in the Inquisitionum ad Capellam Regis Retornatarum Abbreviatio, on 16 April 1606, Robert Graham of Grougar was served heir to his brother Lord John Graham of Knockdolian, in the lands and barony of Grougar in the bailliary of Cunningham [NAS. Retours, Ayr, 85]. Robert Graham evidently already owned land in south Ayrshire which he sold according to a deed in the National Archives of Scotland ‚Äì on 30 April 1606, Robert Graham of Grougar, husband of Margaret Montgomerie, sold land in the parish of Colmonell [NRS.GD109.672]. The Grahams rule as Barons of Grougar was relatively brief as in 1613 the barony was granted to a branch of the Clan Campbell headed by Sir Hugh Campbell, first Lord Loudoun, Sheriff of Ayr and a Privy Councillor in Scotland. On 27 July 1613, King James VI granted the barony of Grougar with its fortalice, manor place, mill, mill-lands, tenantry, etc., in the bailliary of Cunningham, Ayrshire, to Hugh, Lord Loudoun, and his heirs, formerly held by Robert Graham, Earl of Montrose, Lord Graham and Mugdock, lands in the nearby parish of Auchinleck, formerly held by Claud, Earl of Abercorn, were then incorporated in the free barony of Grougar [RGS.VII.896].Registrum magni sigilli regum Scotorum ‚Äì The Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, Volume 7, Entry 896. This grant was confirmed on 23 December 1613 [RGS.VII.967].Registrum magni sigilli regum Scotorum ‚Äì The Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, Volume 7, Entry 967. However Lord Loudoun's ownership of Grougar was very brief as within three years it was granted to the Boyds of Kilmarnock. King James VI granted Robert, Lord Boyd, the lands and barony of Grougar, which Hugh, Lord Loudoun, had resigned, 30 January 1616 [RGS.VII.1372].Registrum magni sigilli regum Scotorum ‚Äì The Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, Volume 7, Entry 1372. Robert Boyd, 7th Lord Boyd , was born in November 1595 elder son of Thomas, 6th Lord Boyd, and died on 28 August 1628. On 11 December 1617, King James VI confirmed a charter of Robert, Lord Boyd, who under his marriage contract of 9 December 1617 granted his future wife Lady Christine Hamilton, Lady Lindsay, daughter of Thomas, Lord Binning president of the College of Justice and Secretary of State, the lands and barony of Grougar [RGS.VII.1733].Registrum magni sigilli regum Scotorum ‚Äì The Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, Volume 7, Entry 1733. However, on 3 August 1619, the king confirmed Robert, Lord Boyd, with the lands and barony of Grougar [RGS.VII.2069].Registrum magni sigilli regum Scotorum ‚Äì The Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, Volume 7, Entry 2069. Robert Boyd, 8th Lord Boyd, was born in 1618, he was a Justice of the Peace for Cunningham by 1634; he subscribed to the Scottish Covenant in 1638, he married Anna Fleming and died on 17 November 1640 and having no children his lands and titles went to his uncle James Boyd. James Boyd, 9th Lord Boyd, was born around 1600; he was a Royalist during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, 1638‚Äì1651. James Boyd married Catherine, second daughter of John Crayke in York before 1640. He died in 1654 leaving a son William and three daughters. On 28 February 1655, William, 10th Lord Boyd, was served heir to his father James, Lord Boyd, in the lordship and barony of Kilmarnock which included the 40 pound land of the old extent and barony of Grougar [NAS. Retours, Ayr, 473]. Charles II created him Earl of Kilmarnock in 1661. Lord Boyd was a Commissioner of Excise for Ayr, a Justice of the Peace for Lanark, Dumbarton and Ayr. He married Lady Jean Cunningham, eldest daughter of William Cunningham, 9th Earl of Glencairn and they had five sons and three daughters of whom William succeeded his father when he died in March 1692. On 11 August 1682, William, Lord Boyd, eldest son of William, Earl of Kilmarnock, was granted the lands of Kilmarnock [RGS.68.140].Registrum magni sigilli regum Scotorum ‚Äì The Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, Volume 68, Entry 140. On 20 July 1699, William, 3rd Earl of Kilmarnock, was served heir to his father William, 2nd Earl of Kilmarnock, in various lands including the above lands in the barony of Grougar [NAS. Retours, Ayr, 698]. The 3rd Earl voted for the Union with England in 1707 and was a staunch Hanoverian. He raised 500 men to oppose the Jacobites in 1715. He died on 22 November 1717 and was succeeded by his son William. William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock, was Grand Master Mason of Scotland in 1742. He, unlike his father, was a Jacobite and fought for Bonnie Prince Charlie with the rank of General and commander of the Horse Grenadier Guards. The Earl was captured at the Battle of Culloden in 1746 and later executed in London. William Boyd, Earl of Kilmarnock, was executed as a Jacobite rebel in 1748, and his titles and lands in Ayrshire, Stirlingshire, and West Lothian were forfeited to the Crown on account of his treason. His son and heir James, Lord Boyd, who had fought for King George at the Battle of Culloden managed to regain some of the forfeited lands but he sold them in 1758. Lord Boyd was Grand Master Mason of Scotland in 1751. The titles and lands of the Jacobite aristocrats and landowners who had supported and participated in the Jacobite rising of 1745 were forfeited to the Crown and the lands were subsequently sold off to speculators, one of whom was Sir George Colebrooke. Sir George Colebrooke, born 1729, was Chairman of the East India Company, a merchant banker and a Member of Parliament. He was also a land speculator in New England, the Ohio Valley, Scotland and the West Indies, and also in raw materials which led to his downfall around 1777. Grougar would have been sold to William Blane around this time. In 1770 the lands of Grougar were owned by Sir George Colebrooke and were valued at ¬£1497.16.0 according to Loretta R. Timberley's ‚ÄòA Directory of Landownership in Scotland c1770‚Äô [Scottish Record Society, Edinburgh, 1976] Both Sir George Colebrooke and William Blane leased the various farmlands within the barony to tenant farmers. An insight into this practice can be had through an examination of the financial records, especially tacks (leases), of William Blane of Grougar which survive for the period 1796 to 1797 [NRS.GD237.21.19]. Grougar remained the property of members of the Blane family for nearly a century. A later William Blane extended his landholdings in the 1820s and 1830s through Crown Charters. He was granted a Crown Charter of the lands of Kirkdomine in 1825 [RGS.175.6];Registrum magni sigilli regum Scotorum ‚Äì The Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, Volume 175, Entry 6. another of the lands of Lammochie in 1830/1834 [NAS.195.9/205.23]. By the time of the New Statistical Account of 1845 one of the chief landowners in the parish of Kilmarnock was William Blane of Grougar. On 27 July 1857, a Crown Charter was granted in favour of William Blane of the lands and barony of Grougar to the trustees of William Blane [NAS. Ref. C2/258/130]. Eventually on 1 December 1881 the Trustees of William Blane sold the lands and barony of Grougar. Grougar was sold to John White of Ardarroch, who as John White of Grougar and Ardarroch had arms bearing \\"an eagle displayed between three quatrefoils azure, on a chief of the second a besant between two garbs of the first\\". [James Balfour Paul's ‚ÄòAn Ordinary of Arms‚Äô] Grougar remained in the hands of John White until 22 November 1904, when his trustees disposed of Grougar to William Cavendish-Bentinck, 6th Duke of Portland. On 13 September 1918, the Duke of Portland subscribed to a disposition and trust deed of the Barony of Grougar. From the Welbeck Estates Company Limited, the trustees acting under disposition and deed of trust by the Duke of Portland, the barony was acquired by Professor David Ian McLean. In 2015 the Barony was assigned to his daughter Dr. Lianne Jennifer McLean on the occasion of her wedding to Mr. Jon Loewen.

Once a title attached to land ownership, Scottish feudal baronies are deemed properties in their own right and can now be transferred independent of the land. For most of its history it was referred to as the Barony of Preston and Prestonpans, but as of 1663 the names were unified into one free barony, the Barony of Preston. The name ‚ÄòPreston‚Äô signifies the town or settlement of priests, which results from monks from Newbattle and Holyrood settling in the district in 1184 AD.

He died in 1489 leaving a widow, Marion Johnstone, and 3 sons. His eldest son Sir Robert succeeded.

Sir John supported the Covenanters and opposed the policies of King Charles I. He married three times and was succeeded by his first born son Sir James in May 1644. Sir James Hamilton was born in 1589, married Barbara Mure in 1609, was knighted in 1615, and died in October 1644. He was also a zealous Covenanter. Sir James seems to have been granted the lands and barony of Preston in 1629.Registrum magni sigilli regum Scotorum - The Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, Volume 8, Entry 1483. On 1 May 1632, Sir James Hamilton of Fingalton, was served heir to his son Robert Hamilton of Preston, in the lands and barony of Preston and Prestonpans with Preston a free burgh of barony. His eldest surviving son John succeeded to the lands and titles. 5 November 1644, John Hamilton of Preston was served heir to his father Sir James Hamilton of Fingalton in the lands and barony of Preston and Prestonpans and Preston a free burgh of barony. John Hamilton entailed his estates and when he died without issue the lands and titles went to his uncle Robert. Robert Hamilton of Sauchieburn, second son of Sir John Hamilton of Preston, had served as a Colonel under King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, during the Thirty Years War. He died in 1648 but childless. The lands and titles then went to Sir Thomas Hamilton, born 1618, 3rd son of George Hamilton of Preston, who was served heir to John Hamilton his paternal uncle‚Äôs grandson (nepotism patrui) in the baronies of Preston and Prestonpans on 2 June 1647. Sir Thomas accompanied King Charles II during the invasion of England in 1651 which ended in disaster at Worcester. As his lands and residence had been destroyed by Cromwell‚Äôs army during the occupation of Scotland after 1651 many original charters were lost. Consequently, the Scots Parliament reissued them including one for the united baronies of Preston and Prestonpans on 4 June 1663. 20 August 1663, King Charles II granted a Crown Charter to Robert Preston of Preston in liferent and his eldest son John Preston, and heirs the above lands now as the free barony of Preston with the town of Preston being created as a free burgh of barony with the right to hold markets.Registrum magni sigilli regum Scotorum - The Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, Volume 11, Entry 507. He married three times and by his second wife Anne Hamilton, had two sons William and Robert, both of whom became baronets of Preston in succession. William Hamilton, 1st baronet, born 1647, became a baronet of Nova Scotia in 1673. He took refuge in Holland and later accompanied William of Orange from Holland to England at the Glorious Revolution of 1688 but died in London shortly thereafter. He married Rachel Nicolson and had three daughters. Consequently, the land and titles were succeeded to by his brother Robert. Sir Robert Hamilton of Preston (1650-1701) was a zealous Presbyterian and led the Covenanters at the victory at the Battle of Drumclog and at the failure at Bothwell Bridge in 1679.Greaves R.L.

He later returned to Scotland where he was arrested and imprisoned in 1692-1693. Sir Robert Hamilton, died 1701, being unmarried conveyed his rights to Thomas Oswald. After the Oswalds the estate was acquired by Lord Grange much of which was eventually bought by Dr James Schaw. Lord and Lady Grange lived at Preston House which was built towards the end of the 16th century for Thomas, son of Sir James Oswald, Lord Provost of Edinburgh and was eventually acquired by Dr James Schaw about 1780 when he acquired the Barony of Preston. Dr. Schaw died in 1784, leaving the barony and the bulk of his estate in support of James Schaw‚Äôs Hospital, a school for boys. The successor of the Schaw Bequest was the East Lothian Educational Trust. In the Crown Charter (1830) the Barony is described as: :‚ÄùALL and WHOLE the Lands and Barony of Preston and Prestonpans with the free Burgh of Barony of Preston and free sea port and harbour thereof for ships with the whole privileges, liberties, casualties and commodities whatsoever pertaining and belonging to the said free Burgh of Barony and harbor aforesaid with the manor place of Preston, houses, biggings, yards, orchards, miln, multures, hains, customs, casualties and duties, saltpans, coal, coalheughs, tenants, tenandries, and services of free tenants and all privileges, liberties, parts, pendicles, and pertinents of the same whatsoever as also ALL and WHOLE the tiend sheaves of the said Lands and Barony of Preston and Prestonpans with tofts, crofts, outsetts,, parts, pendicles and whole pertinents thereof with the privilege and liberty of a weekly market upon Thursday and of one free fair yearly beginning upon the first day of October and continuing for the first, second and third days of the said month commonly called St. Jerom‚Äôs Fair with the whole tolls and customs of the said weekly market and yearly free fair of all united, erected, annexed and incorporated by the ancient infeftments thereof into one free barony called the Barony of Preston, lying in the Constabulary of Haddington and Sheriffdom of Edinburgh.‚Äù The barony of Preston was eventually sold by the Trust and was acquired by Professor David Ian McLean.

He was the VFA's leading goalkicker on four occasions: in 1956 (95 goals), 1957 (97 goals), 1958 (84 goals) and 1961 (a career-best 111 goals); many sources also credit him with a fifth title, in 1963 (44 goals), although contemporary sources suggest he was second behind Yarraville's Robert Evans that year. Bonnett was club captain from 1958 to 1959 and in 1962, won a premiership with the club in 1953, represented the VFA in interstate competition on a number of occasions, and was named in the Port Melbourne Football Club team of the century. He spent his entire senior career with Port Melbourne. Bonnett retired from the seniors at the end of 1963, but continued playing as the captain-coach of the Port Melbourne Seconds team; over the following three seasons, he kicked another 301 goals in the seconds. He coached the Port Melbourne senior team from 1969 until 1971, then returned to coaching the seconds in a non-playing capacity, giving more than thirty continuous years of service to Port Melbourne across his playing and coaching roles. Bonnett was known by the nickname 'Bonox' from his junior days, named after the beef extract product of the same name. Bonnett's younger brother Barry also spent time at full forward at Port Melbourne after Bob's retirement. In 2014, the Williamstown Rd end of North Port Oval was renamed the Bonnett End in honour of Bonnett's goalkicking achievements.

A small brook falls from the flat summit of the Mount Trapetsia (\\"Trapeze\\") into the Talnikova River, a left tributary of the Kureika River. Its height was estimated in 1990 to be 482 meters, although some claim that the height of the entire cascade varies from 600 to 700 meters.  History  Instrumental measurements were first made in 1990 during an expedition into the mountains by Petro Krawtschuk, author of the scientific book Geographisches Kaleidoskop Petro Krawtschuk Geograficheskiy kaleydoskop () 1988 The eight-member expedition was led by Boris Babizki (born 1936; former USSR - athlete). A fall height of 482 m was determined. The measurement result appeared in Kravchuk's book Nature's Records . This seasonal waterfall is notoriously difficult to access and measure since the brook is frozen each year for 10 or 11 months. Its annual reappearance is not regular, every other year the stream is not observed at all, prompting the Russian geographers to dispute whether it still exists.

The oil is accumulated in Upper Miocene sandstone, trapped in Seria Anticline that straddles the present day coastline. This field has produced more than 1 billion barrels of oil for more than 75 years. Brunei Shell Petroleum (BSP) is the operator of this field. Pumpjack near Oil and Gas Discovery Centre. The exploration of the field started in late 1926, when F. F. Marriot (British Malay Petroleum Company Field Superintendent) and T. G. Cochrane (General Manager of Sarawak Oilfields Limited) smelled \\"oil\\" (H2S) in the Kuala Belait area and asked Straub, a Swiss geophysicist, to do a geophysical analysis of the area. At the end of World War II, the Japanese ignited 14 of the 21 wells in the Seria field before evacuating. Australian servicemen attempted to control the fires by stopping the flow of the wells. On 8 October 2004, Brunei Shell Petroleum made a new discovery in Seria North Flank which was an undrilled part of the oil field. The well was drilled 3 km offshore in 8 metres of water by the Schlumberger self-propelled multi-purpose vessel.  Oil Fields  * Tali Oil Field * Enggang Oil Field * Anduki Oil Field Wells To date, more than 900 wells have been drilled in Seria Field, and more than 350 wells are still in production. Key wells include: * S-1 was the first exploration well, drilled in July 1928, which began producing oil in April 1929. * S-2 was brought on stream in 1930. After two blow-outs followed by shutdowns and deliberate sabotage during the war years, it settled to a steady flow on gas-lift and proved to be a valuable producer. * S-5, which is still producing and is the earliest well still in production in Seria Field. * S-328 was drilled in 1953 with a blow-out. With a power of a minor earthquake, it demolished an adjacent building and left a crater flooded with water. * S-454 was spudded in the middle of a housing area. * S-516 was drilled in 1956 with a serious blow-out. A jet of oil, gas and sand rose over 30 meters into the air, and the well had to be 'killed' with 90 tonnes of mud and plugging material. * S-558 was drilled in 1964 across the road from Brunei Shell's head office.

It was described as a new species in 2014, following discovery and analysis of fossilised specimens in mudstone rocks from New York, United States. A team of researchers from the universities of Yale and Kansas, Oxford and the Japan Agency of Marine Science and Technology made the discovery.  Etymology  Estimated to be about 450 million years old, the fossil was obtained with the eggs fossilized with the parent. The species was named after Lucina, the goddess of childbirth in Roman mythology, and incuba, implying the mother was incubating her eggs.  Description  The recently discovered and remarkably well-preserved fossils are about two to three millimeters long, and suggested the animal was intact with a shell along with the delicate parts of limbs and embryos within the shell. The fossil was preserved in pyrite and was examined using X-Ray and CT Scan techniques.  Habitat and behaviour  Ostracods are generally very small-sized crustaceans, that includes more than 20,000 species living today, living in smallest to the largest water bodies. This species was discovered in the mudstone rocks from New York State, from a rock layer called the Lorraine Group. The discovery was said to be the earliest evidence for parental care in the fossils of small shrimp-like creatures that lived in the Ordovician period. ‚ÄúThe mother kept the eggs and the hatchlings in brooding pouches within her body until the young ones were big enough to go out on their own,‚Äù David Siveter, professor of geology at the University of Leicester in the UK who led the study, told The Telegraph India. A research paper by Siveter and his colleagues describing the ostracod fossils was published in the journal Current Biology.

She struggled academically throughout elementary school, and was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder in the sixth grade. By her junior year of high school, she had climbed Mount Adams, Mount Baker and Mount Rainier with her father and Mike Woodmansee, an experienced mountaineer, and had soon resolved to make an attempt at climbing the Seven Summits, the highest mountains in each of the seven continents. Fisher began her bid at completing the Seven Summits challenge in January 2003, with Aconcagua in Argentina, followed in July by Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania and Mount Elbrus in Russia. In 2004, she climbed Mount Kosciuszko in Australia in January, and Mount McKinley in May. She climbed her penultimate peak of the Seven Summits, Vinson Massif in Antarctica, in January 2005. In June 2005, Fisher successfully reached the summit of Mount Everest in Nepal, making her at 20 years old the youngest American to have done so at the time. Her ascent of Everest marked her completion of the Seven Summits; she became the youngest person ever to have completed the challenge. Most of Fisher's Seven Summit climbs were made with expeditions run by Alpine Ascents International, a Seattle-based guiding company, costing a total of US$96,000. Fisher attended Washington State University, where she majored in material science engineering with plans to work in the production of climbing equipment.

The first festival was held in 1995, and is run by The Festival Group, a volunteer group made up of local residents, representatives of local organisations, community groups, schools, church, youth and play groups, artists, musicians, performers and local project workers. Since 2002, the group has been supported and coordinated by the Sneinton Community Project. Each festival is organised around three individual elements: initial workshops, a week-long festival, and lastly a carnival day. The festival is based at the Greenway Centre on Trent Lane. Format Workshops organised by The Festival Group take place in the run-up to the festival, and bring young people together to be creative, most often in local schools and youth groups. The workshops are based around the year's theme, building the artwork, decorations and costumes for the Carnival Parade as well as holding dance and performance workshops. Where possible, the artwork is made using scrap materials - either from the scrapstores, members donations, or found items. School competitions are held to produce the year's festival logos, publicity, as well as to create more material to be used throughout Festival Week. The Festival Week begins on a Saturday, and involves seven days of events held in and around the area. They included exhibitions, displays, open days, performance, entertainers, socials, food tastings and multicultural events run and developed by local groups and organisations under the co-ordination of the festival committee. The events are free and open to everyone and endeavour to reflect the diversity of the local community and represent cultures, age and gender. Festival Week culminates in Carnival Day, held on the next Saturday. The Carnival Parade includes floats, fancy dress, costumes, event performers, samba bands, jazz bands, youth bands, dancers, jugglers and clowns. The Festival then continues in the Hermitage Square when the Carnival Parade arrives, and features an afternoon of free and diverse entertainment, including music performers, dance groups, circus performers, fire eaters, jugglers, magicians, puppet shows, poetry readings, story tellers, as well as karate, gymnastic, aerobics and sport displays. There are many refreshments available, including Asian, Bosnian, West African, French, Italian and Afro- Caribbean food, as well as a traditional British cake stall. Theme Every year the Festival is organised around a different theme, which is used when producing artwork, costumes, performances. Within these themes the group also tries to focus on community issues such as recycling, differing cultures, use and access to the media, or science and technology. Previous themes have been: * 1995 ‚Äì People and Places (world culture) * 1996 ‚Äì Old and New (recycling) * 1997 ‚Äì Sneinton-on-Sea (inner-city seaside) * 1998 ‚Äì Planet Sneinton (sci-fi and technology) * 1999 ‚Äì One upon a time in Sneinton (world folklore) * 2000 ‚Äì Sneinton Millennium (one thousand years of people in Sneinton) * 2001 ‚Äì Technicolor Sneinton (colour, patterns and psychedelia) * 2002 ‚Äì Magic Sneinton (magic, conjuring and mystical stories) * 2003 ‚Äì Channel Sneinton (television, video, film and media) * 2004 ‚Äì Sneintopoly (board games and play from around the world) * 2005 ‚Äì no theme specified * 2006 ‚Äì Sustainable Energy Sources (green energy) * 2007 ‚Äì Earth, Wind, Fire, Water (green energy) * 2009 ‚Äì Sneinton's Got Talent (based on Britain's Got Talent) The 2019 festival was cancelled due to a lack of volunteers and funding, but hopes to return in 2020.

Biography Burger joined the U.S. Army immediately after graduating from Bemidji High School and was stationed in Germany. Burger formed the Five Torquays in 1964 with four other American soldiers he met in Germany. According to him, he joined the band partially because it got him out of his regular job as a fuel truck driver. The Torquays mainly played in hospitals and nursing homes in the beginning and produced a single in a small studio in Heidelberg. Their repertoire consisted mainly of Chuck Berry covers before moving on to more avant-garde original material. A group of German students noticed the band and agreed to manage them if they changed their outfits. The band all wore black cassocks, nooses around their necks, and shaved the top of their heads. By 1965 the Five Torquays had become the Monks. They recorded one album, 1966's Black Monk Time. Although the Monks met with little success during their tenure, they were later cited as an influence on various artists, ranging from Jack White to The Fall. Burger's voice was described by Sean O'Neal as \\"a yowl that was soulful in its own strangled-cat sort of way.\\" After touring Europe for three years, the Monks broke up in 1967. After the breakup, Burger moved back to the United States and enrolled at Bemidji State University on a GI Bill scholarship. He found work digging septic systems by hand. \\"I loved that job, down in a hole with a shovel,\\" he said. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources later hired Burger to create films and advertisements. He opened a small recording studio that serviced the northern Minnesota music scene. In November 1999, Burger reunited with his former Monks bandmates to play a reunion show in New York City after learning copies of Black Monk Time had become collectors items. Burger was elected mayor of Turtle River, Minnesota in 2006. In 2009, he reflected on his time in the Monks: \\"We all knew that we were doing a different sort of music, but as far as being a forerunner band‚Äîthat was the furthest from our minds. We really weren‚Äôt thinking that. We had no idea that we were creating a new movement. And I‚Äôm still thinking, hey, we were just a rock and roll band that really had a lot of fun, and was able to be lucky enough‚Äîor unlucky enough, depending on your point of view‚Äîto work on the album.\\" He died of pancreatic cancer on March 14, 2014, at the age of 71.

In 2011, she won Avenue's Top 40 Under 40 and was also featured in Top 100 Most Powerful Women in Canada in the Future Leaders category by Women's Executive Network.  Early life and education  Scorgie was born in Toronto and raised in Calgary. She credits her parents for teaching her about finances and saving. She received her first allowance, a quarter, when she was three. On her 10th birthday, she purchased her first Canada Savings Bond from $100 that she received from her grand parents and decided to save nearly whatever she earned hoping to become financially successful by 25. While she was in high school, she worked at the Calgary Public Library and invested the majority of her earnings into mutual funds and stocks. When she was young, her family faced financial problems which inspired her to learn about saving. Having a job at the library helped her in reading about finance and investments. She purchased her first mutual fund at 14. According to Scorgie, she became financially literate by reading every Warren Buffett book and getting professional investment advice. Her parents told her that she would have to pay for her college so she started saving. However, when she joined University of Alberta, her savings partly covered her tuition and she had to get loans to pay for the rest. Scorgie graduated from the University of Alberta in 2005 with a Bachelor of Commerce degree in marketing and finance. In 2012, she graduated from the Queen's School of Business with an MBA.  Career  She took her first job at the Calgary Public Library when she was in high school and invested the majority of her earnings into mutual funds and stocks. While she was attending the University of Alberta, she worked at the Royal Bank of Canada for four years. She is the founder and owner of Rich By Inc., the Calgary-based company under which she writes and speaks about financial literacy. She is also a Finance Analyst with EnCana Corporation in the corporate strategy group. o In early 2008, Scorgie joined the board of the YWCA Canada and in 2011 she became the organization‚Äôs treasurer and also serves as a member on the University of Alberta President‚Äôs Think Tank Committee. Scorgie appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show when she was 17 in the segment Ordinary People, Extraordinary Wealth, where she said that she would be a millionaire by 25. However, she was not able to achieve the goal. She has also appeared as a guest on The Montel Williams Show, The Marilyn Denis Show and MTV Live. Scorgie advocates that financial literacy training should be available in grade school to teach children about basic financial and debt principles. She volunteers presenting a money-managing class Money 101 to high school students a few times a year. She also puts on financial literacy presentations for students of University of Alberta. She earned her professional speaking designation through the Canadian Association of Professional Speakers.

The book was released in 2007 and became a bestseller six weeks after its release. According to her, she got the idea of writing the book in her first marketing class at University of Alberta when they were discussing serving various market niches and she realized that there was nobody operating in the financial literacy niche for under-30 people. The book provides worksheets, action plans, and tips to help young people save and plan their financial future. Rich by Thirty has been translated into English, French and Korean. An American version of the book has also been released that eliminates references to Canadian savings vehicles and inserts the American equivalents. She published her second book Rich by Forty: A Young Couple‚Äôs Guide to Building Net Worth in 2010 and it was named a bestseller after its release in 2010.

Polish Volhynia gained (1939); Transcarpatia gained (1945); Romanian islands gained (1948); Crimea gained (1954). Ukraine emerges as the concept of a nation, and the Ukrainians as a nationality, with the Ukrainian National Revival which is believed started sometime at the end of 18th and the beginning of 19th century. According to Ukrainian historian Yaroslav Hrytsak, the first wave of national revival is traditionally connected with publication of the first part of \\"Eneyida\\" by Ivan Kotlyarevsky (1798).Yaroslav Hrytsak. Overview of the History of Ukraine. Part I. In 1846, in Moscow the \\"Istoriya Rusov ili Maloi Rossii\\" (History of Ruthenians or Little Russia) was published. During the Spring of Nations, in 1848 in Lemberg (Lviv)the Supreme Ruthenian Council was created which declared that Galician Ruthenians are part of the bigger Ukrainian nation. The council adopted the yellow and blue flag (Flag of Ukraine). Ukraine first declared its independence with the invasion of Bolsheviks in late 1917. Following the conclusion of the World War I and with the peace of Riga, Ukraine was partitioned once again between Poland and the Bolshevik Russia. The Bolshevik occupied territory was made a puppet state of its pocket Communist Party, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1922, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, together with the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, became the founding members of the Soviet Union. The Soviet famine of 1932‚Äì33 or Holodomor killed an estimated 6 to 8 million people in the Soviet Union, the majority of them in Ukraine.famine of 1932‚Äì33\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Quote: \\"The Great Famine (Holodomor) of 1932‚Äì33 ‚Äì a man-made demographic catastrophe unprecedented in peacetime. Of the estimated six to eight million people who died in the Soviet Union, about four to five million were Ukrainians... Its deliberate nature is underscored by the fact that no physical basis for famine existed in Ukraine... Soviet authorities set requisition quotas for Ukraine at an impossibly high level. Brigades of special agents were dispatched to Ukraine to assist in procurement, and homes were routinely searched and foodstuffs confiscated... The rural population was left with insufficient food to feed itself.\\" Starting out the World War II with the Nazi Germany and being excluded from the League of Nations, in 1941 the Soviet Union was invaded by Germany and its other allies. Many Ukrainians initially regarded the Wehrmacht soldiers as liberators from Soviet rule, while others formed an anti-German partisan movement. Some elements of the Ukrainian nationalist underground formed a Ukrainian Insurgent Army that fought both Soviet and Nazi forces. Sometime after the deportation of Crimean Tatars, in 1954 the Crimean Oblast was transferred from the RSFSR to the Ukrainian SSR. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine became an independent state, formalised with a referendum on December 1. With the 2004 enlargement of the European Union, Ukraine now became an area of overlapping spheres of influence of the European Union and the Russian Federation. This manifested in a political split between the \\"pro-Russian\\" Eastern Ukraine, and the \\"pro-European\\" Western Ukraine, leading to an ongoing period of political turmoil, beginning with the \\"Orange Revolution\\" of 2004, and culminating in 2014 with the \\"Euromaidan\\" uprising and the Crimean Crisis, in which Crimea fell under the control of the Russian Federation. The 19th century In Little Russia [i.e. Ukraine]. Photo by Sergei Prokudin-Gorskii, between 1905 and 1915. Following the 17th century failed attempt to regain statehood in form of Cossack Hetmanate, the future Ukrainian territory again ended up divided between three empires, the Russian Empire, the Ottoman Empire and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In the second half of the 18th century the Catherinine Russian Empire instigated a hysteria in local Eastern Orthodox population by promising protection from Catholicism and support leading to an armed conflict Koliyivshchyna in the neighboring right-bank Ukraine which was part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and resulting in the Polish Bar Confederation, Russian military invasion of Poland and its internal affairs, and successful partitions of the last. By the end of 18th century most of Ukraine was completely annexed by Russia.Orest Subtelny; Ukraine: A History; University of Toronto Press; 2000. . pp 117-145-146-148 At the same time the Catherinine Russia gradually gained control over the area of Black Sea coast (northern Pontic coast) which was part the Ottoman realm at the conclusion of the Russo-Turkish Wars of 1735‚Äì39, 1768‚Äì74, 1787‚Äì92. The lands were generously given to the nobility and the unfree peasantry were transferred to cultivate the Pontic steppe. Forcing the local Nogai population out and resettling the Crimean Greeks, Catherine the Great renamed all populated places and invited other European settlers to these newly conquered lands: Poles, Germans (Black Sea Germans, Crimea Germans, Volga Germans), Swiss, and others. To the southern Ukraine were deported some Estonian Swedes. Since then there exists the old Swedish village of Gammalsvenskby‚ÄìZmiivka. The 1898 congress of Ukrainian writers in Lemberg (Lviv), commemorating the 100 anniversary of publishing of \\"Eneyida\\" Ukrainian writers and intellectuals were inspired by the nationalistic spirit stirring other European peoples existing under other imperial governments. Russia, fearing separatism, imposed strict limits on attempts to elevate the Ukrainian language and culture, even banning its use and study. The Russophile policies of Russification and Panslavism led to an exodus of a number some Ukrainian intellectuals into Western Ukraine, while others empbraced a Pan-Slavic or Russian identity, with many Russian authors or composers of the 19th century being of Ukrainian origin (notably Nikolai Gogol and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky). In the Austrian Empire most of the elite that ruled Galicia were of Austrian or Polish descent, with the Ruthenians mostly representing the peasantry. During the 19th century, Russophilia was a common occurrence among the Slavic population, but the mass exodus of Ukrainian intellectuals escaping from Russian repression in Eastern Ukraine, as well as the intervention of Austrian authorities, caused the movement to be replaced by Ukrainophilia, which would then cross-over into the Russian Empire. First World War, the revolutions and aftermath When World War I and series of revolutions across Europe, including the October Revolution in Russia, shattered many existing empires such as the Austrian and Russian ones, people of Ukraine were caught in the middle. Between 1917 and 1919, several separate Ukrainian republics manifested independence, the anarchist Free Territory, the Ukrainian People's Republic, the West Ukrainian People's Republic, and numerous Bolshevik revkoms. As the area of Ukraine fell into warfare and anarchy, it was also fought over by German and Austrian forces, the Red Army of Bolshevik Russia, the White Forces of General Denikin, the Polish Army, anarchists led by Nestor Makhno. Kyiv itself was occupied by many different armies. The city was captured by the Bolsheviks on 9 February 1918, by the Germans on 2 March 1918, by the Bolsheviks a second time on 5 February 1919, by the White Army on 31 August 1919, by Bolsheviks for a third time on 15 December 1919, by the Polish Army on 6 May 1920, and finally by the Bolsheviks for the fourth time on 12 June 1920. The defeat in the Polish-Ukrainian War and then the failure of the Pi≈Çsudski's and Petliura's Warsaw agreement of 1920 to oust the Bolsheviks during the Kyiv Operation led almost to the occupation of Poland itself. In course of the new Polish-Soviet War purpose of which changed from the 1920 led to the signing of the Peace of Riga in March 1921, and after which the part of Ukraine west of Zbruch had been incorporated into Poland, and the east became part of the Soviet Union as the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. The capital of Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was Kharkiv; in 1934, the capital was relocated to Kyiv.  Interbellum =Soviet Ukraine= Flag of Soviet Ukraine The Ukrainianization program aimed at fostering Ukrainian ethnic identity among the population of Ukraine. This 1921 recruitment poster uses Ukrainian orthography to convey its message, \\"Son, join the school of Red commanders, and the defense of the Soviet Ukraine will be ensured\\". The Ukrainian national idea lived on during the inter-war years and was even spread to a large territory with traditionally mixed population in the east and south that became part of the Ukrainian Soviet republic. The Ukrainian culture even enjoyed a revival due to Bolshevik concessions in the early Soviet years (until the early-1930s) known as the policy of Korenization (\\"indigenisation\\"). In these years, an impressive Ukrainization program was implemented throughout the republic. Alongside this a number of national territorial units were set aside for non Ukrainian ethnic groups. As well as an autonomous republic in the west for Ukraine's Molovian people several national raions including 8 Russian, 7 German, 4 Greek, 4 Bulgarian, 3 Jewish and 1 Polish national raion existed in this period. The rapidly developed Ukrainian language based education system dramatically raised the literacy of the Ukrainophone rural population. Simultaneously, the newly-literate ethnic Ukrainians migrated to the cities, which became rapidly largely Ukrainianised‚Äîin both population and in education. Similarly expansive was an increase in Ukrainian language publishing and overall eruption of Ukrainian cultural life. At the same time, the usage of Ukrainian was continuously encouraged in the workplace and in the government affairs as the recruitment of indigenous cadre was implemented as part of the korenisation policies. While initially, the party and government apparatus was mostly Russian- speaking, by the end of the 1920s the ethnic Ukrainians composed over one half of the membership in the Ukrainian communist party, the number strengthened by accession of Borotbists, a formerly indigenously Ukrainian \\"independentist\\" and non-Bolshevik communist party. Despite the ongoing Soviet Union-wide antireligious campaign, the Ukrainian national Orthodox church was created called the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC). The Bolshevik government initially saw the national church as a tool in their goal to suppress the Russian Orthodox Church always viewed with the great suspicion by the regime for its being the cornerstone of pre-revolutionary Russian Empire and the initially strong opposition it took towards the regime change. Therefore, the government tolerated the new Ukrainian national church for some time and the UAOC gained a wide following among the Ukrainian peasantry. A 1934 photo of the DnieproGES hydropower plant, a heavyweight of Soviet industrialization in Ukraine. The change in the Soviet economic policies towards the fast-pace industrialisation was marked by the 1928 introduction of Joseph Stalin's first piatiletka (a five-year plan). The industrialisation brought about a dramatic economic and social transformation in traditionally agricultural Ukraine. In the first piatiletkas the industrial output of Ukraine quadrupled as the republic underwent a record industrial development. The massive influx of the rural population to the industrial centres increased the urban population from 19% to 34%.  Soviet collectivisation  However, the industrialisation had a heavy cost for the peasantry, demographically a backbone of the Ukrainian nation. To satisfy the state's need for increased food supplies and finance industrialisation, Stalin instituted a program of collectivisation of agriculture, which profoundly affected Ukraine, often referred to as the \\"breadbasket of the USSR\\". In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the state combined the peasants' lands and animals into collective farms. Starting in 1929, a policy of enforcement was applied, using regular troops and secret police to confiscate lands and materials where necessary. Many resisted, and a desperate struggle by the peasantry against the authorities ensued. Some slaughtered their livestock rather than turn it over to the collectives. Wealthier peasants were labeled \\"kulaks\\", enemies of the state. Tens of thousands were executed and about 100,000 families were deported to Siberia and Kazakhstan. Forced collectivisation had a devastating effect on agricultural productivity. Despite this, in 1932 the Soviet government increased Ukraine's production quotas by 44%, ensuring that they could not be met. Soviet law required that the members of a collective farm would receive no grain until government quotas were satisfied. The authorities in many instances exacted such high levels of procurement from collective farms that starvation became widespread. Starved peasants on a street in Kharkiv, 1933. The Soviet famine of 1932‚Äì33, called Holodomor in Ukrainian, claimed up to 10 million Ukrainian lives as peasants' food stocks were forcibly removed by Stalin's regime by the NKVD secret police.\\"Ukraine remembers famine horror\\". BBC News. November 24, 2007. As elsewhere, the precise number of deaths by starvation in Ukraine may never be precisely known. That said, the most recent demographic studies suggest that over 4 million Ukrainians perished in the first six months of 1933 alone, a figure that increases if population losses from 1931, 1932 and 1934 are also included, along with those from adjacent territories inhabited primarily by Ukrainians (but politically part of the Russian Federated Soviet Socialist Republic), such as the Kuban. The Soviet Union suppressed information about this genocide, and as late as the 1980s admitted only that there was some hardship because of kulak sabotage and bad weather. Non-Soviets maintain that the famine was an avoidable, deliberate act of genocide. The times of industrialisation and collectivisation also brought about a wide campaign against \\"nationalist deviation\\" which in Ukraine translated into an assault on the national political and cultural elite. The first wave of purges between 1929 and 1934 targeted the revolutionary generation of the party that in Ukraine included many supporters of Ukrainization. The next 1936‚Äì1938 wave of political purges eliminated much of the new political generation that replaced those that perished in the first wave and halved the membership of the Ukrainian communist party.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Ukraine article, page 51. The purged Ukrainian political leadership was largely replaced by the cadre sent from Russia that was also largely \\"rotated\\" by Stalin's purges. As the policies of Ukrainisation were halted (1931) and replaced by massive Russification approximately four-fifths of the Ukrainian cultural elite, intellectuals, writers, artists and clergy, had been \\"eliminated\\", executed or imprisoned, in the following decade. Mass arrests of the hierarchy and clergy of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church culminated in the liquidation of the church in 1930. Galicia and Volhynia under Polish rule siege of Lviv by Poles (November 1919) and the Polish border at the Zbruch River by the war's end, with eastern Galicia (shown in blue) under the Polish control. Following the end of World War I, the eastern part of the former Austrian province of Galicia, as well as Volhynia, which had belonged to the Russian Empire, became the area of a Polish-Ukrainian War. The Ukrainians claimed these lands because they made up the majority of population there (except for cities, such as Lviv), while the Poles saw these provinces as Eastern Borderlands, a historical part of their country. The war was won by the Poles, and their rule over these disputed lands was cemented after another Polish victory, in the Polish-Soviet War. While some Ukrainians supported Poland, their hopes for independence or autonomy were quickly dashed. In the interbellum period, eastern Galicia was divided into three administrative units ‚Äî Lw√≥w Voivodeship, Stanis≈Çaw√≥w Voivodeship, and Tarnopol Voivodeship, while in Volhynia, Wo≈Çy≈Ñ Voivodeship was created. The Ukrainian majority of these lands was often treated as second class citizens by the Polish authorities. The conflict escalated in the 1930s, with terrorist actions I. Katchanovski, Terrorists or National Heroes? Politics of the OUN and the UPA in Ukraine of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists resulting in increasingly heavy-handed actions by the Polish government. The tensions were further exacerbated by arrival of thousands of osadniks, or Polish settlers, who were granted land, especially in Volhynia. Henryk J√≥zewski advocated a self-governance autonomy for Ukrainians in Volhynia 1928‚Äì1938.T. Snyder, Sketches from a Secret War: A Polish Artist's Mission to Liberate Soviet Ukraine Polish rule over the provinces ended in September 1939, following Nazi and Soviet attack. After the Battle of Lviv, units of the Red Army entered regional capital, Lviv, and following the staged Elections to the People's Assemblies of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus, both eastern Galicia and Volhynia were annexed by the Soviet Union. A few days after the Germans invaded Poland, Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin told an aide his long-term goal was the spread of Communism in Eastern Europe: > Now [Poland] is a fascist state, oppressing the Ukrainians, Belorussians and > so forth. The annihilation of that state under current conditions would mean > one fewer bourgeois fascist state to contend with! What would be the harm if > as a result of the rout off Poland we were to extend the socialist system > onto new territories and populations. Historian Geoffrey Roberts notes that the comments marked a change from the previous \\"popular front\\" policy of Communist Party cooperation with other parties. He adds, \\"Stalin's immediate purpose was to present an ideological rationale for the Red Army's forthcoming invasion of Poland\\" and his main message was the need to avoid a revolutionary civil war.\\" Historian Timothy D. Snyder suggests that, \\"Stalin may have reasoned that returning Galicia and Volhynia to Soviet Ukraine would help co-opt Ukrainian nationalism. Stalin perhaps saw a way to give both Ukrainians and Poles something they wanted, while binding them to the USSR.\\" World War II Poland and Romania and before the German invasion of Soviet Union. Soviet soldiers preparing rafts to cross the Dnieper during the Battle of the Dnieper (1943). The sign reads \\"To Kyiv!\\". Following the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact, in September 1939, German and Soviet troops divided the territory of Poland, including Galicia with its Ukrainian population. Next, after France surrendered to Germany, Romania ceded Bessarabia and northern Bukovina to Soviet demands. The Ukrainian SSR incorporated northern and southern districts of Bessarabia, the northern Bukovina, and additionally the Soviet-occupied Hertsa region, but ceded the western part of the Moldavian ASSR to the newly created Moldavian SSR. All these territorial gains were internationally recognized by the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947. When Nazi Germany with its allies invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, many Ukrainians and Polish people, particularly in the west where they had experienced two years of harsh Soviet rule, initially regarded the Wehrmacht soldiers as liberators. Retreating Soviets murdered thousands of prisoners. Some Ukrainian activists of the national movement hoped for a momentum to establish an independent state of Ukraine. German policies initially gave some encouragement to such hopes through the vague promises of sovereign 'Greater Ukraine' as the Germans were trying to take advantage of anti-Soviet, anti-Ukrainian, anti-Polish, and anti-Jewish sentiments. A local Ukrainian auxiliary police was formed as well as Ukrainian SS division, 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Galicia (1st Ukrainian). However, after the initial period of a limited tolerance, the German policies soon abruptly changed and the Ukrainian national movement was brutally crushed. Some Ukrainians, however, utterly resisted the Nazi onslaught from its start and a partisan movement immediately spread over the occupied territory. Some elements of the Ukrainian nationalist underground formed a Ukrainian Insurgent Army that fought both Soviet and Nazi forces. In some western regions of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army survived underground and continued the resistance against the Soviet authorities well into the 1950s, though many Ukrainian civilians were murdered in this conflict by both sides. Burned out buildings in Kyiv during the Second World War. The Nazi administrators of conquered Soviet territories made little attempt to exploit the population's possible dissatisfaction with Soviet political and economic policies. Instead, the Nazis preserved the collective-farm system, systematically carried out genocidal policies against Jews, and deported many Ukrainians to forced labour in Germany. In their active resistance to Nazi Germany, the Ukrainians comprised a significant share of the Red Army and its leadership as well as the underground and resistance movements. Total civilian losses during the War and German occupation in Ukraine are estimated at seven million, including over a million Jews shot and killed by the Einsatzgruppen. Wreath-laying ceremony in Babi Yar, where the Nazis murdered approximately 100,000 people Many civilians fell victim to atrocities, forced labor, and even massacres of whole villages in reprisal for attacks against Nazi forces. Of the estimated eleven million Soviet troops who fell in battle against the Nazis, about 16% (1.7 million) were ethnic Ukrainians. Moreover, Ukraine saw some of the biggest battles of the war starting with the encirclement of Kyiv (the city itself fell to the Germans on 19 September 1941 and was later acclaimed as a Hero City) where more than 660,000 Soviet troops were taken captive, to the fierce defence of Odessa, and on to the victorious storming across the Dnieper river. According to the researcher Rolf Michaelis who is referring to the SS- Hauptamt's document No. 8699/42, the Police Battalion \\"Ostland\\" (Field Post Number 47769) resided in the Reichskommissariat Ukraine in 1941‚Äì1942, and was one of the main executioners of the Jews. The Police Battalion \\"Ostland\\" was an Ordnungspolizei unit that served in World War II under the command of the Schutzstaffel. The battalion established in October 1941 carried out punitive duties.Massimo Arico, Ordnungspolizei ‚Äì Encyclopedia of the German police battalions September 1939 ‚Äì July 1942, p. 144-145. On June 28, 1941 the town of Rivne (R√≥wne) was captured by Nazi Germany, which later established the city as the administrative centre of the Reichskommissariat Ukraine. In July 1941 the 1st company of the Police Battalion \\"Ostland\\" was in Frankfurt, the rest of the battalion was in Rivne. In October 1941 the battalion was sent to Lviv (Lw√≥w). At the time, roughly half of R√≥wne's inhabitants were Jewish. About 23,000 of these people were taken to a pine grove in Sosenki and slaughtered by the 1st company of the Police Battalion \\"Ostland\\" between the November 6, and 8, 1941 (1st company). A ghetto was established for the remaining ca 5,000 Jews.Rolf Michaelis, Der Einsatz der Ordnungspolizei 1939‚Äì1945. Polizei-Bataillone, SS-Polizei-Regimenter. Michaelis Verlag ‚Äì Berlin, 2008.

Sch√∂ningh, Paderborn 2006, . On July 13‚Äì14, 1942, the remaining population of the R√≥wne ghetto ‚Äì about 5,000 Jews ‚Äì was sent by train some 70 kilometres north to Kostopil (Kostopol) where they were murdered by the 1st company of the Police Battalion \\"Ostland\\" in a quarry near woods outside the town. The R√≥wne ghetto was subsequently liquidated. As reported on July 14, 1942: The battalion or elements of it provided security along with the Ukrainische Hilfspolizei for a transport of the Jews from the Riga Ghetto to the Riga Central Station using the wagons (1st company). July 15, 1942 another thousand Jews were executed in the same place. As reported on June 27, 1942, ca 8,000 Jews were executed near the town of S≈Çonim. As reported on July 28, 1942, ca 6,000 Jews were executed in Minsk.Rolf Michaelis, Eestlased Waffen-SS-is 20. SS relvagrenaderidiviis. Tallinn: Olion, 2001. p. 32. In November 1942 the Police Battalion Ostland together with an artillery regiment, and three other German Ordnungspolizei battalions under the command of Befehlshaber der Ordnungspolizei im Reichskommissariat Ukraine and SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer und Generalleutnant der Polizei Otto von Oelhafen, took part in a joint anti-partisan operation near Ovruch (Owrucz) with over 50 villages burnt down and over 1,500 people executed. In a village 40 people were burnt alive for revenge for the killing of the SS-Untersturmf√ºhrer T√ºrnpu(u). In February 1943 the battalion was sent to Reval, Estland with Polizei F√ºsilier Bataillon 293. By March 31, 1943, the Estnische Legion had 37 officers, 175 noncoms and 62 privates of the Police Battalion \\"Ostland\\".Massimo Arico, Ordnungspolizei ‚Äì Encyclopedia of the German police battalions September 1939 ‚Äì July 1942, p. 249-258. Kyiv was recaptured by the Soviet Red Army on 6 November 1943. During a period of March 1943 to the end of 1944 Ukrainian Insurgent Army committed several massacres on Polish civilian population in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia having every signs of genocide (Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia).

After World War II some amendments to the Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR were accepted, which allowed it to act as a separate subject of international law in some cases and to a certain extent, remaining a part of the Soviet Union at the same time. In particular, these amendments allowed the Ukrainian SSR to become one of founding members of the United Nations (UN) together with the Soviet Union and the Byelorussian SSR. This was part of a deal with the United States to ensure a degree of balance in the General Assembly, which, the USSR opined, was unbalanced in favor of the Western Bloc. In its capacity as a member of the UN, the Ukrainian SSR was an elected member of the United Nations Security Council in 1948‚Äì1949 and 1984‚Äì1985. Over the next decades, the Ukrainian republic not only surpassed pre-war levels of industry and production but also was the spearhead of Soviet power. Ukraine became the centre of Soviet arms industry and high-tech research. The republic was also turned into a Soviet military outpost in the cold war, a territory crowded by military bases packed with the most up-to-date weapons systems. Such an important role resulted in a major influence of the local elite. Many members of the Soviet leadership came from Ukraine, most notably Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev a Soviet leader from 1964 to 1982, as well as many prominent Soviet sportsmen, scientists and artists. In 1954, the Russian-populated oblast of Crimea was transferred from the Russian to the Ukrainian Soviet Republic. However, the relatively underdeveloped industrial branches such as coal- and iron ore mining, metallurgy, chemical and energy industry dominated the republic's economy. Once a Cossack steppe, the southern oblasts of Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia were turned into a highly industrialised area with rapidly increasing impact on its environment and public health. A pursuit to energy production sufficient for growing industry led to the gigantic nature- remastering: turning the Dnieper River into a regulated system of large reservoirs. The products of the rapidly developed high-tech industry in Ukraine were largely directed for military consumption, similarly to much of the Soviet economy, and the supply and quality of consumer goods remained low compared even to the neighboring countries of the Eastern bloc. A state- regulated system of production and consumption lead to gradual decrease of quality of life and growing \\"shadowisation\\" of retail infrastructure as well as of corruption. The town of Pripyat, Ukraine was the site of the Chernobyl disaster, which occurred on April 26, 1986 when a nuclear plant exploded. The fallout contaminated large areas of northern Ukraine and even parts of Belarus. This spurred on a local independence movement called the Rukh that helped expedite the break-up of the Soviet Union during the late 1980s. Independent Ukraine (1991 to present) Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin signed the Belavezha Accords, dissolving the Soviet Union, 8 December 1991 = Kravchuk and Kuchma rule (1991‚Äì2004) = Modern Flag of Ukraine On January 21, 1990, over 300,000 Ukrainians organised a human chain for Ukrainian independence between Kyiv and Lviv, in memory of the 1919 unification of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the West Ukrainian National Republic. Citizens came out to the streets and highways, forming live chains by holding hands in support of unity. Ukraine officially declared itself an independent state on August 24, 1991, when the communist Supreme Soviet (parliament) of Ukraine proclaimed that Ukraine would no longer follow the laws of the USSR, and only follow the laws of the Ukrainian SSR, de facto declaring Ukraine's independence from the Soviet Union. On December 1, Ukrainian voters overwhelmingly approved a referendum formalising independence from the Soviet Union. Over 90% of Ukrainian citizens voted for independence, with majorities in every region, including 56% in Crimea, which had a 75% ethnic Russian population. The Soviet Union formally ceased to exist on December 26, when the presidents of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia (the founding members of the USSR) met in Belovezh Pushcha to formally dissolve the Union in accordance with the Soviet Constitution. With this, Ukraine's independence was formalized de jure and recognised by the international community. On 2 December 1991, Poland and Canada were the first countries to recognize Ukraine's independence.Ukraine and Russia: The Post- Soviet Transition by Roman Solchanyk, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2000, (page 100) Canadian Yearbook of International Law, Vol 30, 1992, University of British Columbia Press, 1993, (page 371) Russia, Ukraine, and the Breakup of the Soviet Union by Roman Szporluk, Hoover Institution Press, 2000, (page 355) The history of Ukraine between 1991 and 2004 was marked by the presidencies of Leonid Kravchuk and Leonid Kuchma. This was a time of transition for Ukraine. While it had attained nominal independence from Russia, its presidents maintained close ties with their neighbours. On June 1, 1996, Ukraine became a non-nuclear nation, sending the last of the 1,900 strategic nuclear warheads it had inherited from the Soviet Union to Russia for dismantling.Power versus Prudence: Why Nations Forgo Nuclear Weapons by T.

In 2004, Leonid Kuchma announced that he would not run for re-election. Two major candidates emerged in the 2004 presidential election. Viktor Yanukovych, the incumbent Prime Minister, supported by both Kuchma and by the Russian Federation, wanted closer ties with Russia. The main opposition candidate, Viktor Yushchenko, called for Ukraine to turn its attention westward and eventually join the EU. In the runoff election, Yanukovych officially won by a narrow margin, but Yushchenko and his supporters cried foul, alleging that vote rigging and intimidation cost him many votes, especially in eastern Ukraine. A political crisis erupted after the opposition started massive street protests in Kyiv and other cities, and the Supreme Court of Ukraine ordered the election results null and void. A second runoff found Viktor Yushchenko the winner. Five days later, Viktor Yanukovych resigned from office and his cabinet was dismissed on January 5, 2005. =Yushchenko rule= Yushchenko at the University of Amsterdam, with chloracne from TCDD dioxin poisoning (2006). In March 2006, the Verkhovna Rada elections took place and three months later the official government was formed by the \\"Anti-Crisis Coalition\\" among the Party of Regions, Communist, and Socialist parties. The latter party switched from the \\"Orange Coalition\\" with Our Ukraine, and the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc. Yulia TymoshenkoThe new coalition nominated Viktor Yanukovych for the post of Prime Minister. Yanukovych once again became Prime Minister, while the leader of the Socialist Party, Oleksander Moroz, managed to secure the position of chairman of parliament, which is believed by many to have been the reason for his leaving the Orange Coalition, where he had not been considered for this position. On April 2, 2007, President Yushchenko dissolved the Verkhovna Rada because members of his party were defecting to the opposition.Steven Lee Myers Published: May 31, 2007, Confusion, chaos and comedy in Ukrainian politics International Herald Tribune His opponents called the move unconstitutional. When they took the matter to the Constitutional Court, Yushchenko dismissed 3 of the court's 18 judges, accusing them of corruption. During the Yushchenko term, relations between Russia and Ukraine often appeared strained as Yushchenko looked towards improved relations with the European Union and less toward Russia. In 2005, a highly publicized dispute over natural gas prices took place, involving Russian state-owned gas supplier Gazprom, and indirectly involving many European countries which depend on natural gas supplied by Russia through the Ukrainian pipeline. A compromise was reached in January 2006, and in early 2010 a further agreement was signed locking the price of Russian gas at $100 per 1,000 cubic meters in an exclusive arrangement. By the time of the presidential election of 2010, Yushchenko and Tymoshenko ‚Äî allies during the Orange Revolution ‚Äî had become bitter enemies. Tymoshenko ran for president against both Yushchenko and Viktor Yanukovych, creating a three-way race. Yushchenko, whose popularity had plummeted, refused to close ranks and support Tymoshenko, thus dividing the anti-Yanukovych vote. Many pro-Orange voters stayed home.Ukraine's New President: Is the Orange Revolution Over?, Time.com (11 February 2010) Yanukovych received 48% of the vote and Yushchenko less than 6%, an amount which, if thrown to Tymoshenko, who received 45%, would have prevented Yanukovych from gaining the presidency; since no candidate obtained an absolute majority in the first round of voting the two highest polling candidates contested in a run-off second ballot which Yanukovych won. =Yanukovych rule= Viktor Yanukovych During Yanukovych's term he has been accused of tightening of press restrictions and a renewed effort in the parliament to limit freedom of assembly.

On March 5, 1841 he married Sarah Jacoba (Smith) Fagg, a widow who was a Vlissingen native from a prominent local family of English and Dutch ancestry, who had managed the family business for two years after the death of her husband, Captain John Fagg.Database genealogie Planje, Planjer, Planije, Zetteler en aanverwanten, Genealogical database, in Dutch. After Zetteler's second bankruptcy the family came to the United States, taking passage at Antwerp on a sailing ship that landed them at New York City. They proceeded to Albany, New York and thence by canals and the Great Lakes to Milwaukee, landing July 3, 1848, and there they settled down on a farm. In 1853 Zetteler moved the family to Madison, Wisconsin and opened a general store. The mother and children ran the store and Zetteler worked for official offices of the State, including the Secretary of State of Wisconsin and the State Register of Deeds. He became a notary public in 1855. In 1858, a fire destroyed all of the family's property, and Zetteler returned to Milwaukee and went into the real estate business as a developer. He served as a justice of the peace, a notary public, and was a deputy United States Marshal. In 1863 Zetteler was elected to serve as a Democrat in the 6th Milwaukee County district (the 6th and 9th wards of the City of Milwaukee) of the Wisconsin State Assembly, succeeding fellow Democrat Adam Poertner (or P≈ìrtner).
