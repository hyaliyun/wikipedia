Early Life Seyid Islam Khodja was born to Seyid Ibrahim Khoja in 1872 in Khiva. Growing up in the family of an Islamic clergy representative, Khodja studied at the Khiva madrasa. In addition to the native Khorezm dialect of the Uzbek language, he was fluent in Persian, as well as being proficient in Turkmen. He began his political career as governor of Hazorasp. In 1898, at the age of 26, he was appointed Grand Vizier of the Khiva Khanate, becoming the second statesman in the Khanate, and one of the youngest Grand Viziers in the history of the Khiva Khanate. At the time, the Khan was Muhammad Rahim Khan II. With his death in 1910, his son, Isfandiyar Khan, ascended the throne. With Isfandiyar Khan's enthronement, Islam Khodja began to play a much larger role in the Khanate. Isfandiyar Khan was only one year older than him, and, unlike his father, Isfandiyar did not have any special abilities in governing. Islam Khodja was popular amongst the Khivan population and part of the ruling elite. He was seen as an enlightened, wise, and fair vizier.Islomkhozha - National Encyclopedia of Uzbekistan . - Tashkent, 2000-2005. Modernization Policies During the reign of Isfandiyar Khan, Islam Khodja visited St. Petersburg and Moscow several times as part of a delegation from the Khiva Khanate. Islam Khodja admired European culture and tried to westernize the Khiva Khanate. With the permission of the khan, he received many foreign ambassadors and delegations from European countries. With his efforts and at his own expense, a ginnery, the first power station in the Khanate, a hospital, a pharmacy, a post office, a telegraph, Jadidist secular schools, as well as a Russian school were built. Islam Khodja was the leader of the right wing of the Khorezm JadidistsIslomkhozha - National Encyclopedia of Uzbekistan. Tashkent, 2000-2005., which united the Bais (the rich), industrialists and merchants. This was one of the rare cases in which one of the leaders in the state sided with the Jadidists. The right wing of the Jadidist movement, unlike the left wing, advocated for the preservation of the monarchy, but also for the implementation of liberal policies and large scale social, political, and economic changes in the Khanate. In neighboring states, there had already been significant political change - the Constitutional Revolution in Qajar Iran had brought much change and Russia had been subject to a revolution. Only the neighboring Emirate of Bukhara was still traditionalist and conservative. Bukharan leaders, under Mohammed Alim Khan, agreed with Isfandiyar Khan that they did not want radical transformations. Buildings In 1910, with the efforts and funds of Islam Khodja, a large complex was constructed in the Southeast of Itchan Kala (the inner city of Khiva), comprising the Islam Khodja madrasah and the eponymous minaret, which were 44.6 meters high, becoming the highest minaret of Khiva and the entire Khiva Khanate. It was slightly shorter than the Kalyan minaret in Bukhara. Death A number of public speeches made by Islam Khodja have been recorded, in which he spoke out against some customs and Sharia punishments for criminals and those who were disliked by people in power. He also demanded an end to arbitrary officials and the introduction of administrative reforms that would have prevented growing discontent from peasants. According to some reports, this was consistent with the opinion of the Governor-General of Turkestan, whose land bordered the Khiva Khanate to the North and Northeast. In 1910, the Khivan leadership was forced to publish a manifesto restricting the rights of landowners and the clergy under the guidance of the Young Khivans. This cause a wave of reactions from conservatives in the Khanate who allegedly managed to win Isfandiyar Khan to their side, convincing him that Islam Khodja was a threat to the Khan's power and the integrity of the state.–ì—É–ª–æ–º–æ–≤ –•. –ì. –î–∏–ø–ª–æ–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏—è –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤ –°—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–µ–π –ê–∑–∏–∏ —Å –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–µ–π –≤ XVIII ‚Äî –ø–µ—Ä–≤–æ–π –ø–æ–ª–æ–≤–∏–Ω–µ XIX –≤–µ–∫–∞. ‚Äî –¢–∞—à–∫–µ–Ω—Ç, 2005.–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –£–∑–±–µ–∫–∏—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∞. –¢. 3. ‚Äî –¢–∞—à–∫–µ–Ω—Ç, 1993. In 1913, Isfandiyar Khan invited Islam Khodja to his palace and released him at night after the Isha prayer. On the way to his suburban palace, located near the cemetery of Oglan Adiz-bobo, several people attacked Islam Khodja and inflicted several fatal knife wounds. After Islam Khodja's death, Isfandiyar Khan was found crying. The Khan ordered the executions of all of Islam Khodja's assassins, even though he knew about the murder, and, in the words of the former Young Khivan, Polvonniyoz hoji Yusupov, \\"the direct benefactor of the murder was Isfandiyar Khan himself.\\" Having learned about the murder of the reformist Islam Khodja, a special commission was sent by the Russian Empire to investigate it. However, the commission was bribed by the frightened Khan's close associates and clergy, who were enemies of Islam Khodja, to not investigate. Soon after the assassination of Islam Khodja, his son, Abdusalam Khoja, was shot dead. His assistant and right-hand man, Raim Bergen, was found buried alive. Family It is known that one of the wives of Isfandiyar Khan was Islam Khodja's daughter, and that Islam Khodja was the father-in-law of the Khan.Islomkhozha - National Encyclopedia of Uzbekistan. Tashkent, 2000-2005. Islam Khodja himself was also married. The name of his only son, Abdusalam Khoja, is known. Films Unlike the policy of the conservative leadership of the neighboring Emirate of Bukhara, where art, photography and film were looked down upon, Islam Khodja contributed to the development and origin of photography and cinema in Khorezm. He invited Russian and European specialists to Khiva and supported the first Khorezm and Uzbek photographer and cameraman Khudaibergen Devanov. In 2018, a historical drama movie about him premiered, titled \\"Islam Khodja\\". It was written by Jurabek Ruzmetov and directed by Jahongir Akhmedov.

In declaring this decade, the United Nations General Assembly recognized the importance of family farming in reducing poverty and improving global food security (Resolution A/RES/72/239). The UN Decade of Family Farming is led by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in collaboration with governments and civil society organizations.  Family farming  thumb Though there is no single, universal definition of family farming, it can be defined as : ‚Äúa means of organizing agricultural, forestry, fisheries, pastoral and aquaculture production which is managed and operated by a family and predominantly reliant on family labor, including both women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs. The family and the farm are linked, co-evolve and combine economic, environmental, reproductive, social, and cultural functions‚Äù. Family Farming is the predominant form of agriculture in both developing and developed countries. In fact: * There are an estimated 500 million family farms, representing over 90% of all farms globally *Family farms produce more than 80% of the food in the world. * More than 90% of farms are run by an individual or a family and rely primarily on family labor * Most family farms are small (an estimated 84% of farms globally are below 2 hectares.  Background  The United Nations declared 2014 the International Year of Family Farming (IYFF). Following the success of IYFF 2014, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed 2019‚Äì2028, the United Nations Decade of Family Farming (UNDFF). The decade was launched on the 29th of May 2019. An International Steering Committee (ISC UNDFF), composed of representatives of the Member States and family farmer organizations, oversees the implementation of the UNDFF. The ISC UNDFF is supported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) joint secretariat.  Aims  The UNDFF seeks to address the need for a global food system that provides sufficient, affordable, and nutritious food while accounting for climate change and the growing population. According to FAO, by the year 2050, the world's agricultural production will need to increase by about 50% in order to feed the growing population. The UN considers that family farming holds the key to a sustainable food system and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The UNDFF serves as a framework for countries to develop public policies and investments to support family farming from a holistic perspective, unleashing the transformative potential of family farmers to contribute to achieving the SDGs.FAO and IFAD. 2019.

Conflict, urbanization, resource constraint, and climate change are amongst these challenging issues. Poverty and hunger are also constant challenges, while almost 80% of the world's poor depend on agricultural production.See Putting family farmers at the centre to achieve the SDGs available for download at http://www.fao.org/family-farming-decade/about/en/ The UN General Assembly assessed that in family farming lies the potential to achieve the SDGs.

Early life and education Dorothea Buck was born in April 1917, the fourth of five children in Naumburg an der Saale, where she grew up. In 1936, at the age of nineteen, she was diagnosed with schizophrenia at Bodelschwingh Foundation Bethel. There she was exposed to baths and cold water head pourings for \\"disciplining\\", then common practices of psychiatry in the first half of the 20th century. She found the \\"complete speechlessness\\" to be especially humiliating: patients did not speak to each other and conversations between staff and patients were unusual. According to the \\"Law for the Prevention of Diseased Offspring\\" Buck was forcibly sterilized in the Bodelschwingh Foundation Bethel on 18 September 1936. Career After World war II, Buck began to work as a sculptor. From 1969 to 1982 she was a teacher of art and worked in Hamburg. After her last treatment, in the early 1960s, Buck became an advocate for mental health, introducing an approach that gave value to patients' experiences. She wrote an autobiography, published in 1990, under a pseudonym which was an anagram of \\"schizophrenia\\" in German, entitled \\"On the Trail of the Morning Star: Psychosis as Self-Discovery\\". In 2011, she created the Dorothea Buck Foundation for mutual support of psychiatric patients. Buck introduced an approach called \\"trialogue\\" with the head of the Special Outpatient Clinic for Psychosis at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf and colleagues, which \\"gives equal weight to the experience of the mental health professional, the mental health service user, and the patient's family\\". Buck pushed the German psychiatric profession to confront the role its members had played under the Nazi regime. The German Association for Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics created a travelling exhibition about it. Buck died in Hamburg in October 2019 at the age of 102.

The trophy was created on the suggestion of former FSU President Sandy D'Alemberte, after Virginia became the first ACC program to defeat Florida State on November 2, 1995. To that point, the Seminoles had run up a perfect 29‚Äì0 record through their first 3¬Ω years of Atlantic Coast Conference play. Virginia and Florida State played each other yearly between 1992 and 2006, but the game never became a major rivalry (e.g., called \\"one of the lesser known rivalries in college football\\" by the Orlando Sentinel).Nov. 19, 2019 FSU Notebook, Orlando Sentinel, accessed November 9, 2019 The annual game was not preserved by the ACC when its divisional play began, and the Cavaliers and Seminoles began facing off much more rarely. In recent decades the games are sporadic but competitive: since 2005, Virginia is 3‚Äì2 against Florida State (as of 2019). Virginia won the most recent trophy game in 2019, and currently possesses the Jefferson-Eppes Trophy in Charlottesville. The teams will meet again in 2020 in Tallahassee, but unless they meet in an ACC Championship Game, Florida State and Virginia will not match up on the gridiron again until at least 2025. Eppes, Trophy, and Statue This football trophy was created in 1995 by Florida State president Sandy D'Alemberte and was named for former President of the United States and founder of the University of Virginia, Thomas Jefferson, and Jefferson's grandson Francis W. Eppes, a two-time mayor of Tallahassee(now Florida State University). In 1856, he presented the offer of a building and funds to the State Assembly of Florida to have the West Florida Seminary located at Tallahassee. The Semiary later evolved into FSU. Thomas Jefferson's youngest daughter was Mary Jefferson Eppes, mother of Francis Eppes. Her death, in 1804, prompted Abigail Adams to thaw relations between the Adams and Jefferson families by writing her condolences to Thomas Jefferson. Francis was only three years old when his mother died and had no memory of her. Seven years after this football trophy was created, an Eppes statue was created and placed as a focal point of the FSU Legacy Walk in 2002. Former Florida State president D'Alemberte also spearheaded this effort. The Eppes statue later became controversial, in 2016, due to Eppes' history of expanding his slave ownership to encompass several working cotton plantations prior to the American Civil War, supporting the Confederacy in various ways, and organizing night watches to catch slaves in the streets of territorial Tallahassee. Despite this history, FSU students voted by a large margin, 72% to 28%, to keep the Eppes statue. The Florida State administration moved its location in 2018. Construction The trophy is composed of an intricately wrought silver pitcher presented to the city of Tallahassee, Florida by Eppes in 1842 and set upon a wood base made of remains of the McGuffey Ash, which was once the largest tree on the Grounds of the University of Virginia but suffered a fatal tree disease in 1990. The trophy was designed by Ryan Parker.

He is best known for being the first official United States Army Chaplain.1 The Army Chaplaincy: Professional Bulletin of the Unit Ministry Team, Department of the Army (1995), p. 32  Personal and family life  Little is known about John Hurt's early life. Many of the records of his birth, early education and marriages were destroyed by Union soldiers near the conclusion of the American Civil War.2 The patriot preachers of the American Revolution, With biographical sketches. 1776-1783, Frank Moore (1860), p. 135 Some genealogical records place his birth year as early as 1738 (six years younger than George Washington). However, most historical accounts and genealogical records put his year of birth in 17523 Families of Halifax County, Virginia, M. Secris, p. 113 (three years older than Alexander Hamilton). This confusion is most likely derived from the Hurt family's reuse of given names over several generations. Some sources list James Hurt and Jane Bickley as parents, while others claim that Jane Bickley had died prior to Hurt's birth and instead list Benjamin Hurt and Anne Newman as parents. What is known about his early life is that John Hurt came from a long line of devout anglicans. Two of his relatives (probably his uncles), Philemon and William Hurt were also Anglican ministers before the American War of Independence. After the Continental Army's victory and the formation of the United States Anglicans in the United States restructured the church and it was renamed the Episcopal church,4 A Brief History of the Episcopal Church, David L. Holmes (1993) due to broken ties with England and, by association, the Church of England. He was ordained as a minister in Trinity Parish on December 21, 1774. After his extensive military service in the revolution as a chaplain, he married Nellie McTaggart of Virginia in 1785. The exact date of the marriage is disputed. From this marriage, he had two daughters: Martha Patsy and Sarah Elizabeth Hurt. After the death of his first wife, he remarried Sallie Franklin. The date of the marriage is disputed between 1788 and 1796. From his second marriage, he had two sons. James and Samuel Jones Hurt.5 North America, Family Histories, 1500-2000 for Sallie Franklin Much like the accounts of his early life, the historical and genealogical records often conflict on the dates and even years of his marriages and birth of his children. Even the exact time of his death is unclear, but most sources agree he died sometime in 1824 in Prince Edward County, Virginia. In all historical accounts of his chaplaincy, it is made clear that little is known about, and few records remain of his personal life and this part of his life is likely to remain a mystery.  Military service  He began his service in the continental army on October 1, 1776. His experience as a minister qualified him to serve as chaplain to the Virginia 6th Infantry Regiment. George Washington desired that every regiment of continental soldiers be assigned a chaplain, but the continental congress at the time due to financial concerns did not authorize the commission of more chaplains. As a result, John Hurt became chaplain to the 4th and 5th Virginia infantry regiments as well. These units were later consolidated on August 18, 1778, into a brigade commanded by General George Weedon. Hurt would become this brigades chaplain and remain so until the end of his service in 1783.6 American Army Chaplaincy: A Brief History, United States. Army Service Forces Office of the Chief of Chaplains (1946)7 The patriot preachers of the American Revolution, With biographical sketches. 1776-1783, Frank Moore (1860) As an episcopal minister, his method of preaching stood in contrast to ministers of other denominations. One source cites the difference this way, \\"While the sermons of presbyterians, congregational and baptist chaplains were clearly outlined giving an exegetical giving the context of the verse used, its theological ramifications, and finally, its immediate application in practicalities of the existential situation, sermons extant from Anglican chaplain border more on the style of highly refined homilies, but lacking contextual explanations.\\"9 As a soldier he has been described as \\"the bravest of the brave\\".9 Families of Halifax County, Virginia, M. Secrist, p.114 He served alongside his fellow Virginia soldiers in the battles of Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine Creek, Germantown, the encampment at Valley Forge, the battle of Monmouth and the Siege of Charleston. During the Virginia campaign Hurt was used as an intelligence officer for General Baron Von Steuben. He was captured in January 1781 a few months before the battle of Blandford. = Capture = In 1780 General George Washington had agreed with British commander Sir Henry Clinton that all men of both sides that were designated as chaplains were not to be detained as prisoners of war, but were to be immediately released. Despite this, after Hurt's capture in Northern Virginia, he spent several months detained in a British prison barge off the Atlantic coast. The exact duration and location of his imprisonment are unknown. He was later paroled, as was custom, to the city of Norfolk and later the state of Virginia. However, he was still dissatisfied with the conditions of his parole. There is still extant a letter he wrote in September 1781 directly to George which requested Washington's help in canceling his parole, exchanging him for a British chaplain and returning him to active duty. A portion of the letter reads, \\"By endeavoring to gain intelligence for the Baron de Steuben last January, I was made a prisoner by a party of Simpcoe's Corps. After suffering the most ignominious treatment at different times onboard different prison Ships about a month ago I had my parole extended from the Town of Norfolk to the State of Virginia there to remain till exchanged or my parole altered. By the information I have had from Col. Tilman with respect to the British Chaplains, I humbly conceive that it is in your Excellency's power to have my parole of honor officially canceled which would add very much to my happiness I conclude also from the above information that I have been unjustly detained and improperly paroled.\\" General Washington, unfortunately, was unable to help. Washington wrote a response that is housed in the Library of Congress explaining his inability to exchange him but expressed his confusion that he was not being released due to his status as a chaplain.10 The US Army Chaplaincy - From European Antecedents to 1791, Parker C. Thompson, Office of the Chief of US Army Chaplain Corp (1978), p. 206 = Peacetime = Despite his capture, Hurt witnessed some of the most iconic events of the American Revolution. After his seven years of service and the end of the fighting, Hurt returned to his parish in Virginia and ministered to the people there. Records of his peacetime sermons describe Hurt's orations to be particularly eloquent, \\"theologically sensitive and homiletically alert, he was a good pastor and able preacher. Several of his sermons were printed and circulated by some of his parishioners who were tremendously impressed by the content and structure of the discourse. Each manuscript contained the hallmark of an artisan.\\"11 The Army Chaplaincy: Professional Bulletin of the Unit Ministry Team, Department of the Army (1995), p. 33 For his service in the revolution, he was awarded 5,000 acres of land in western Virginia in what is today Cumberland County, Kentucky. However, it is believed that he deeded most of this property to his younger relatives soon after acquiring it.12 The Army Chaplaincy: Professional Bulletin of the Unit Ministry Team, Department of the Army (1995), p. 33  US Army chaplain  After the end of the Revolutionary War, the Continental Army was dissolved. Forming a peacetime government was the primary focus of American political leadership. Uprisings such as Shay's Rebellion and attacks on frontier outposts raised concerns among those of the new federal government in 1791. After a massive defeat given by the Miami Tribe congress was hard- pressed to increase the number of soldiers in its regular army. Accordingly, on March 3, 1791 an act of Congress permitted the formation of a new regiment of infantry in the regular army. The new regiment brought the total number of regiments in the regular US Army to two. The act called for a brigadier general, a quartermaster and a chaplain to be commissioned.13 The Public Statutes at Large form the from the Organization of the Government in 1789 to March 3, 1845, Library of Congress, p, 222 https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/1st-congress/c1.pdf After receiving authorization from the Senate, George Washington sent a letter to Congress nominating Arthur St. Claire as Brigadier General, Samuel Hodgdon as quartermaster and John Hurt as the chaplain. These men were instated into their respective positions on March 4, 1791. As Chaplain of the Army Hurt was to be paid $600 a year, above average for the time. Hurt was most likely ill and not present during the first major conflict that his men participated in. General St. Claire, who was also the acting Governor of the Northwest Territory, led the defense of the frontier. On September 4, 1791, St. Claire's forces encountered Native forces led by Blue Jacket and Little Turtle. The American force was devastated. Their casualties numbered 657 dead and 271 wounded. This defeat was the worst ever suffered at the hands of Native Americans, dwarfing the American casualties during \\"Custer's Last Stand\\".14 The Army Chaplaincy: Professional Bulletin of the Unit Ministry Team, Department of the Army (1995), p. 36 This defeat prompted congress to further enlarge the army to three regiments. Hurt, however, would remain the army's only chaplain. After the increase in the armies size a new commander was appointed, General Anthony \\"Mad Anthony\\" Wayne. John Hurt resigned from his post on September 20, 1794. He was succeeded by Pennsylvania Baptist minister David Jones, who would serve for another six years. It would be JOnes, not Hurt that would serve during the army's next major engagement. \\"Mad Anthony\\" led a force that defeated Native forces in Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794. Unfortunately, any records of John Hurt's service during the engagements prior to his resignation were most likely destroyed when the British invaded Washington D.C. during the War of 1812. This stands in contrast to Jones who, unlike hurt, was an avid diarist.15 The Army Chaplaincy: Professional Bulletin of the Unit Ministry Team, Department of the Army (1995), p. 37  Historical connections  John Hurt has a few remaining historical connections to key American political figures during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Besides his letters to George Washington during the war, in peacetime, he wrote to both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison on personal matters. These matters, for the most part, involved horses. It is clear from his letter the horses were a passion of Hurt's. One of his letters to James Madison revolved mainly around the recommendation of a horse he thought Madison should buy.16 Letter from John Hurt to James Maidson, James Madison Papers, Library of Congress https://www.loc.gov/resource/mjm.05_0968_0969/?sp=1  Legacy  Hurt only served for three years as chaplain of the Army. He was succeeded by David Jones, a baptist from Pennsylvania. After the end of Jones' tenure as chaplain of the Army, the post was eliminated. Chaplaincy in the expanding United States Army would be organized in various forms over the rest of the 19th century. Finally, with the National Defense Act of 1920 the Army Chaplain Corp was formally organized into its current form. Although the structure is presently different from the time of John Hurt, his role as the first chaplain of the army has set a precedent of including clergy as an essential part of the United States military efforts.  Notable sermons  American leadership had always been supportive of the chaplains' roles in the army. The chaplain's duties went beyond the ecclesiastical. They included promoting ideas of democracy as essential to a happy society and discouraging sinful behavior while encouraging obedience to officers and loyalty to the army.17 Military Chaplains' Review, Chaplains, U.S. Army (January 1, 1987) p. 37 John Hurt excelled at fulfilling these roles. Few examples of his work exist today, but below are two extant sermons Hurt gave during the revolution. = Franco- American Alliance Sermon = After the American victory against British General John Burgoyne at Saratoga, New York, American delegates to France were successful in securing an alliance between the two nations. The announcement of this alliance inspired American patriots to continue fighting and the occasion was marked by speeches and other celebrations. Chaplains were instrumental in giving speeches to celebrate the alliance. These speeches promoted patriotism and optimism about the righteousness of their rebellion. John Hurt gave one of the most impassioned speeches on the alliance. An excerpt from one of Hurts speeches is a follows: \\"By wisdom of our councils, and the magnanimous perseverance of our troops, during three campaigns, we have at length received the most manifest tokens of divine approbation; and now, by the alliance of a great and warlike European power, we stand in a situation that bids defiance to our enemies - a situation which affords the fairest prospect - the blessings of PEACE, LIBERTY, and SAFETY, the end of our warfare. For these ye fought, for these, ye bled -and not in vain! But through form the goodness of our cause the wisdom of our councils, the abilities of our generals, the courage of our troops, the strength of our armies, as well as our foreign alliances, we now have the most reasonable hope of establishing America freedom; yet it is a truth which reason and experience, as well as religion, teach us, that the race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong; that the event of all things is in the hand of God, and more especially the fate of nations is weighed and determined by him. \\"And if in the common occurrences of life, it is our wisdom and interest, as well as our duty, to look up to heaven for a blessing on our labors, it certainly becomes a far more indispensable duty on so important an occasion. Presumptuous confidence in our own strength might mostly provoke God to give us up to the tyranny of our enemies; while pious trust in his mercy may be a powerful means to draw down his blessings in our favor. Let us then consider the present duty as a point on which the fate of nations is suspended; and let us, therefore, redouble our diligence, and endeavor to acquire the highest perfection in our several duties, whether religious, civil or military; for the more we do for ourselves the more reason have we to expect the smiles of providence. In the name then of all that is sacred, and in defense of all that is dear to us, let us exert ourselves from the highest to the lowest, to deserve the great and wonderful deliverance with providence hath manifested toward this infant land! ... You, my fellow soldiers, are the hope of our country; to your arms, she looks for defense, and for your health and success, her prayers are incessantly offered. Our God has heard them - the princes of the earth court our friendship - we have a name among nations - victory and triumph attend us; and unless our sins forbid, our warmest wishes shall be most amply completed. \\"Let us then join in one general acclamation to celebrate this important event; and while our vices proclaim our joy, let our hearts glow with gratitude to the God of nations, who is able to help us, and whose arm is mighty to save. Thus shall we see, and triumph in the fight, while malice frets, and fumes, and gnaws her chains, AMERICA shall blast her fiercest foes! Out-brave the dismal shocks of bloody war! And in unrivaled pomp resplendid rise, and shine sole empress of the western world!\\"(May 6, 1778, Valley Forge, Pennsylvania)18 The US Army Chaplaincy - From European Antecedents to 1791, Parker C. Thompson, Office of the Chief of US Army Chaplain Corp (1978), p. 289 = The Love of Our Country = The following excerpt is from one of Hurt's sermons entitled \\"For the Love of Our Country\\" and was given to soldiers fighting in the New Jersey Campaign in 1777: \\"The name of patriot implies, in its true sense, everything that is most great and godlike among men; it carries in it the idea of a public blessing; it implies a power of doing good, exerted and extended to whole communities, and resembles within its sphere, that universal Providence which protects and supports the world. This is that elevated passion, of all others the most necessary, as well as most becoming, to mankind ... The miseries of the state of nature are so evident, that there is no occasion to display them; every man is sensible that violence, rapine, and slaughter must be continually practiced where no restraints are provided to curb the inordinacy of self-affection. To society, then, we must owe our security from these miseries, and to a wisely- constructed and well-regulated government we must stand indebted for our protection against those who would encroach upon the equal share of liberty which belongs to all, or would molest individuals in the possession of what is fairly appropriated, or justly claimed. And what an unspeakable satisfaction it is to be free, and to be able to call anything one's own I Freedom and security diffuse a cheerfulness over the most uncomfortable regions, and give a value to the most inconsiderable possessions...to be unmindful of the public, is not only an argument of an ungrateful, it is a proof also of a dishonest temper of mind. \\"God has assigned each of us our station, and a part which we are obliged to discharge in carrying on the great work of social happiness. If then, I neglect the part appointed me, I am highly unjust; because I take a share of the benefits of society, and yet leave the burden to be borne by others. A greater injustice than this can scarcely be conceived...The public good is, as it were, a common bank, in which every individual has his respective share; and, consequently, whatever damage that sustains, the individuals unavoidably partake of the calamity. If liberty is destroyed, no particular member can escape the chains; if the credit of the associated body sink, his fortune sinks with it; if the sons of violence prevail, and plunder the public stock, his part cannot be rescued from the spoil...But still, the more noble motive to a generous soul is that which springs from a benevolent desire of diffusing the joys of life to all around him. There is nothing, he thinks, so desirable as to be the instrument of doing good; and the further it is extended, the greater is the delight, and the more glorious his character...The liberty we contend for is not the license of a few to tyrannize over multitudes, but equal freedom to all, so far as is consistent with the present circumstances of our country, good order, the constitution, and peace of government. \\"These are circumstances which give a sanction to patriotism and not only justify but demand our most active resolutions to promote the welfare of our country by all those methods which become a civilized and numerous people, born with an instinctive love of liberty...If the love of your country is indeed the governing principle of your soul, you will give up every inclination which is incompatible with it; nor will you cherish in your hearts any rivals of the favorite passion. All the train of darling vices must, therefore, be brought forth, and offered up as victims on the altars of liberty...National affection, therefore, if it be derived from a true principle, must necessarily inspire a moral conduct, must incline us to quit every baneful vice, to contract the circle even of what we call innocent amusements, and, instead of looking out for daily parties of pleasure, it will prompt us rather make a constant festival of human kindness, the most delicious of all entertainments to a generous mind. If we behave thus, then we are patriots indeed.\\"19 2 The patriot preachers of the American Revolution, With biographical sketches. 1776-1783, Frank Moore (1860), p. 136  References  Category:1752 births Category:1824 deaths Category:People from Pamplin, Virginia Category:American Anglicans Category:United States Army chaplains Category:Continental Army officers from Virginia ","title":"John Hurt (chaplain)"},{"id":"62249423","text":"Franciska is a given name.

Family Louis de Courbon, Marquis de Coutr√©, was the second son of Charles de Courbon de Bl√©nac, marquis de la Roche-Courbon (died 10 June 1696), and Ang√©lique de la Rochefoucaut. His father became a mar√©chal de camp in the king's army, in 1669 became a ship's captain, and in 1677 was made governor and lieutenant general of the French Islands and all the lands of America. Louis de Courbon had nine brothers and sisters. As a boy he was a page of King Louis XIV of France. He joined the navy in November 1675, and became a ship's captain (capitaine de vaisseau) in January 1689. Governor of Saint-Domingue Haiti, formerly Saint-Domingue. Cap-Fran√ßais is now called Cap-Ha√Øtien Bl√©nac was offered the position of Governor of Saint-Domingue to replace Nicolas de Gabaret in a latter of 13 September 1712. He was named governor of Saint- Domingue in place of Nicolas de Gabaret on 1 October 1712, and was received by the Council of Cap Fran√ßois on 13 June 1713. He took over from Paul-Fran√ßois de La Grange d'Arquien, who had acted as governor after Gabaret's death. Blenac found the colony at peace, since under the Treaty of Utrecht the English had left. However, there were constant squabbles over land among the settler families. Blenac had three subordinate governors, that of Saint-Louis on √éle-√†-Vache opposite Les Cayes on the south coast, another at L√©og√¢ne for the east coast, and that of Sainte-Croix for the north coast. The Count of Arguyan, who had been acting governor, resumed his post at the Cap-Fran√ßais (now Cap-Ha√Øtien), which he commanded as Governor of Sainte-Croix. The correspondence from the Secretary of State for the Navy to Bl√©nac and the intendant Jean-Jacques Mithon de Senneville from September 1712 to July 1715 has been preserved. It covers finance, provisions, the state of the colony, the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), fortifications, appointments, complaints, trade restrictions and relations with Spain (which occupied the east of the island). Blenac was given strict instructions to prevent foreign trade, which was difficult in Saint-Domingue given the great length of the coastline from which ships could carry goods to and from Jamaica. In 1713 Brenac and Mithon reported that the town of L√©og√¢ne, founded two years earlier, was growing rapidly. They were doing all they could to encourage settlers to build in the town. There was difficulty in obtaining bricks for barracks and magazines in L√©og√¢ne and Petit-Go√¢ve. Lemaire had started a brick making factory at considerable cost but with no result. The right soil had not been found, and the bricks crumbled into small pieces in the rain. De Champ had better results at Cap Fran√ßais (now Cap-Ha√Øtien), but his bricks cost more than those from France. On 1 January 1714 the king signed an order making the leeward islands independent of the windward islands. A letter of 10 January 1714 from the Secretary of State for the Navy informed Bl√©nac of the death of Raymond Balthazar Ph√©lypeaux, governor-general of the French West Indies. The West Indies would now have two governors-general, Bl√©nac in Saint-Domingue, and another in the Windward Islands. Further letters discussed black slaves shipped by the Compagnie du S√©n√©gal, taxes, trade, shortage of coinage, sugar factories, negro regulations, lawsuits and piracy. Blenac was less active than Duquesne in the Windward Islands, and had more difficulty pursuing the smugglers. His health could not cope with the tropical climate, and he asked for recall to France. Bl√©nac returned to France in 1716. He was replaced as governor-general on 1 January 1717 by Charles Joubert de La Bastide, marquis de Ch√¢teaumorand. Bl√©nac died in Rochefort on 10 July 1722. He had never married.

It was developed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) in 2016 as part of a long generation of ultra-wideband (UWB) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems created to combat buried landmines and IEDs. Past iterations include the railSAR, the boomSAR, and the SIRE radar.  Development  The SAFIRE radar was initially conceived as a response to the increasing congestion of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum due to the recent growth of wireless technology. As part of an effort to improve upon the existing SIRE radar system, the U.S. Army Research Laboratory designed the SAFIRE radar as a UWB radar that could match or exceed the performance of the SIRE radar while operating in congested RF environments. Instead of impulse UWB, it was fitted with a stepped-frequency design in order to retain spectral agility while maintaining minimal ADC sampling requirements. The SAFIRE radar was also designed to be highly reconfigurable due to its nature as an experimental radar. The SAFIRE radar differs from past UWB SAR systems developed by ARL like the boomSAR and the SIRE radar in that it utilizes a stepped-frequency system rather than a short- pulse one. One of the main challenges caused by the nature of the SIRE radar as an impulse UWB system was its high susceptibility to in-band radio frequency interference (RFI). In contrast, stepped-frequency radars can excise specific frequencies within their operating band, which reduces interference from nearby radar systems. In addition, the frequency bands where RFI is present can be easily removed with the use of spectral sensing techniques. Furthermore, while impulse UWB radars like the SIRE radar must avoid transmitting signals in certain reserved frequency bands, stepped-frequency radars possess the flexibility to transmit signals that conform to any spectral shape, so long as the return signals are processed to minimize the noise. The resulting radar imagery of this approach may feature bands of frequencies over the operating bandwidth with no data as a consequence. Due to these configurations, the SAFIRE radar is capable of performing ultra-wideband operations with comparable range resolution and penetration abilities while avoiding spectral areas congested with high RF content. Once development was completed, the SAFIRE radar was later subjected to a series of field trials at an arid Army test site in 2016 and 2017, where it was tasked with detecting several anti-tank landmines hidden throughout the site and buried at different depths. According to the results of these experiments, the SAFIRE radar was shown to be capable of detecting and imaging broadside-oriented landmines that were buried as deep as 8 inches in the soil.  Characteristics  The SAFIRE radar operates at a bandwidth ranging from 300 MHz to 2 GHz with a minimum frequency step size of 1 MHz. However, the frequency step size can be set by the user and is generally governed by the speed of the vehicle on which the system is mounted. While an increase in bandwidth may improve the resolution and the signal-to-clutter ratio, SAFIRE's radar resolution was specifically chosen to be comparable to the dimensions of a typical anti-personnel (AP) landmine. The radar system utilizes a superheterodyne architecture in order to keep the RFI further separated from the received signal within the radar operating band. It was also designed to have highly reconfigurable timing control, where the user can select the transmit and receive on/off times with 8.33 nanosecond resolution. = Antennas = The SAFIRE receiver antennas are arranged in a uniform linear array that consists of 16 ARL-manufactured Vivalvi notch antennas. Two large ETS-Lindgen quad-ridged horn transmit antennas are stationed above the array and separated from the receive antennas by radar absorbing foam. The radar system can be configured to have either a forward- or side-looking orientation, but doing so requires the Vivalvi notch antennas to be physically rotated. In contrast, the ETS-Lindgen horn antennas can be electronically switched between vertical or horizontal polarizations. Through this configuration, it becomes possible for the SAFIRE system to collect fully polarimetric data. = Transmitter = The transmitter consists of two mixing stages produce the operating frequency by mixing the three generated signals. Once filtered, the operating frequency passes through the Tx-Enable switch and then the Tx-LR switch, both of which are made out of commercial off-the-shelf components. The Tx-Enable switch is responsible for controlling the pulse width and duty cycle of the operating frequency and can also disable the transmitter during listen-only mode. When the SAFIRE radar is not in listen-only mode, the signal is sent to the Tx-LR switch, which is used to cycle between the left and right transmitters. A third switch called the Tx-Pol switch controls which polarization port is used after the power amplification performed by an ARL-manufactured printed circuit board (PCB), which is incorporated with AD9249 integrated circuits. = Receiver = The receiver tracks the current operating frequency during the first mixing stage using a stepped local-oscillator (LO), which is held at a constant offset to the stepped operating frequency. This first mixing stage serves to collapse the 1700-MHz operating bandwidth into a narrowband IF, which is then amplified and filtered. Once amplified, the signals are split four ways and connected to a Rx module, which consists of three PCBs and four receiver channels. = Cameras = The SAFIRE radar also features two electro-optical (EO) Point Grey Flea 2G HD cameras and two long-wave infrared (LWIR) Xenics Gobi 640 cameras. The EO cameras are capable of 2448x2048 resolution and 7.5 frames per second, while the LWIR cameras operate between 8 and 14 micrometers with 55-mK sensitivity. The data generated from these four cameras can be superimposed with the collected radar data to produce a stereoscopic augmented reality display for the user that allows them to view all the sensor data simultaneously. In addition, this data makes it possible for the SAFIRE system to generate a metric reconstruction of the scene with information about the spatial extent and proximity of the objects present. Plans were also made to combine data from the EO and LWIR cameras to create 3D metric scans of the environment complete with depth, color, thermal, and radar information to enhance the user's viewing experience. = Position and motion sensors = A GPS receiver and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) are both incorporated into the SAFIRE radar to collect and determine the position and movements of the platform as it travels on top of its designated vehicle. This information allows the system to create SAR imagery using the radar's backprojection imaging technique.

Soucek has designed a dominant negative variant, Omomyc, which allows her to investigate the benefits of inhibiting Myc in cancer.  Early life and education  Soucek was born in Velletri on the outskirts of Rome. She studied biology at the Sapienza University of Rome and graduated in 1996. After earning her bachelor's degree Soucek moved to the National Research Centre in Rome, where she started a doctorate in genetics and molecular biology. During this time she started researching novel treatments for cancer. Soucek completed her PhD in 2001 and joined the University of California, San Francisco as a postdoctoral fellow. She was appointed as an Assistant Researcher in the laboratory of Gerard Evan in 2006. She returned to Europe in 2011, joining VHIO (Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology).  Research and career  Soucek is Head of the Mouse Models of Cancer Therapies Group at VHIO and was the first woman and non-Spanish national to be appointed as Principal Investigator. She was promoted to Research Professor at ICREA in 2014. In 2014 she founded a spin-out company, Peptomyc S.L.. In 2015 she was made Associate Professor at the Autonomous University of Barcelona. Her research considers the Myc oncoprotein, a protein that cancer cells appear to depend on but had previously been considered too difficult to target. She has demonstrated that inhibition of Myc can have a therapeutic index in mouse models of cancer, causing minimal side effects in regular tissues. Soucek created Omomyc, a dominant negative form of Myc that can inhibit the oncogene without causing adverse impacts. As Omomyc is tolerated by mice and has anti- tumour activity, Soucek has been developing an efficient and safe drug version. She believes that inhibition of Myc can force the immune system to wake up, and kill cancer from the inside and outside. Peptomyc have demonstrated that Omomyc can be used against non-small-cell lung carcinoma. In 2019 Peptomyc was awarded the European Institute of Innovation and Technology Public Prize.

Fontaine's research interests included theoretical and observational studies of white dwarfs, sub-dwarf stars and astroseismology (the interpretation of variations in brightness of certain pulsating or vibrating stars to understand their interior structure). In particular, he found that white dwarfs can serve as test benches for the equation of state, the coefficient of transport, and the phase transition between solid and liquid states at very high densities.  Early life and education  Gilles Fontaine was born in 1948 in L√©vis, Quebec. He obtained a Bachelor of Science degree from Universit√© Laval in 1969. He arrived at the University of Rochester in the fall of that year to begin his graduate work, initially hoping to study quantum optics. However, he ended up following his interest in astronomy to work with Hugh M. Van Horn on modeling convection in the surface layers of white dwarfs.  Career  After receiving his PhD in 1974, he completed a postdoctoral fellowship at University of Western Ontario where he worked with John Landstreet, gaining experience with observational astronomy. In 1977 he became an assistant professor at the Universit√© de Montr√©al. He was promoted to associate professor in 1980 and full professor 1986. In 1981, expanding upon his PhD research in white dwarfs, Fontaine founded a research group specializing in white dwarf asteroseismology with his colleague Fran√ßois Wesemael. This research group received international acclaim for its wide-ranging contributions to our understanding of white dwarfs. Three of Fontaine's PhD students, would go on to win the Canadian Astronomical Society Plaskett medal, awarded for the most outstanding doctoral thesis in astronomy at a Canadian university. In 1982, the group made headlines by predicting the existence of a new type of pulsating star, a DB white dwarf, which was later confirmed by telescope observations. This was the first time that the existence of a variable star was predicted by mathematical models first, rather than being discovered first through observations. In 1987, Fontaine along with his collaborators, attempted to determine the age of the Universe using the amount of time it takes for white dwarfs to cool. Comparing observations to numerical simulations, the found that the Universe is between 10 billion and 300 million years old. In 1990, his group published the first results from the Whole Earth Telescope, a network of telescopes around the world located at different longitudes that could collectively provide continuous observations of pulsating white dwarfs. In 1996, the asteroseismology group at the Universit√© de Montr√©al once again predicted a new type of variable star, a B-type white subdwarf, which was confirmed by observations by the South African Astronomical Observatory in 1997. In 1992, he became a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and in 2016 he was awarded the Canadian Association of Physicists Medal for Lifetime Achievement in Physics \\"for his pioneering, world-renowned work in theoretical and observational studies of white dwarf stars.\\" Over his career, he published more that 200 scientific articles. He was a member of the Institute for Research on Exoplanets (iRex) and the Centre de recherche en astrophysique du Qu√©bec (CRAQ). Fontaine died November 1, 2019 in Montreal, Quebec.

The district was originally known as Mill Creek Township, one of five civil townships established in Jackson County after West Virginia became a state in 1863; it was renamed \\"Ripley Township\\" after its chief town in 1871, and the following year, all of West Virginia's townships were converted into magisterial districts.United States Census Bureau, U.S. Decennial Census, Tables of Minor Civil Divisions in West Virginia, 1870‚Äì2010.\\"Division of the County into Districts\\", in Hardesty's Biographical Atlas of Jackson County, West Virginia, H.H. Hardesty & Co., New York, Toledo, and Chicago (1883). When Jackson County was redistricted in the 1990s, the area of Ripley District was divided between the new Eastern and Western Magisterial Districts. However, the county's historic magisterial districts continue to exist in the form of tax districts, serving all of their former administrative functions except for the election of county officials.W. Va. Code ¬ß 11‚Äì3‚Äì1A. Geography Ripley District is located in the central and southern portions of Jackson County. To the north, it is bounded by Ravenswood District, to the east by Washington District, to the northwest by Union District, and to the southwest by Union District in Mason County, Buffalo-Union District, formerly Union District in Putnam County, and District 3 and District 4, formerly Poca District, in Kanawha County. With an area of 145 square miles, it is the largest of Jackson County's historic districts. Most of Ripley District is hilly, except for the bottomlands along Mill Creek and its numerous tributaries.United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Cottageville Quadrangle (ed. 1960, rev. 1989).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Gay Quadrangle (ed. 1960, rev. 1987).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Kenna Quadrangle (eds. 1906, 1957, rev. 1975).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Kentuck Quadrangle (ed. 1957, rev. 1975).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia‚ÄìOhio, Ravenswood Quadrangle (ed.

Sept. 1908). =Streams= The principal stream of Ripley District is Mill Creek, which traverses the district from east to west, with its upper waters arising in the western portion of Roane County, then crossing Washington District on its way to Ripley; below Ripley the creek continues in a northwesterly direction through Union District, and empties into the Ohio River at Millwood, West Virginia. It is sometimes known as \\"Big\\" Mill Creek to distinguish it from two other streams in Jackson County, both known as \\"Little Mill Creek\\", one in Union District, and the other a tributary of Big Mill Creek.\\"Towns and Villages: Ripley\\", in Hardesty's Biographical Atlas of Jackson County. Mill Creek is formed by the confluence of Little Mill Creek and the Elk Fork, about seven miles above Ripley, in the eastern part of the district. Most of Little Mill Creek is in Washington District, and its upper waters reach all the way into Roane County. It flows westward into Ripley District just below the village of Hereford, where it is met by Joes Run. Between Hereford and its confluence with the Elk Fork, Little Mill Creek is joined by Stationcamp Run, coming from the west past Mount Olive Church. Most of the Elk Fork is likewise in Washington District, but just after entering Ripley District it meets with Scale Run, flowing southwest out of Washington District, and Wolf Run, coming from the south. After Little Mill Creek and the Elk Fork converge, Mill Creek winds southwest through the hills and past the village of Shatto, until it meets the Tug Fork, coming from the southeast, about four miles above Ripley. Most of the Tug Fork and its tributaries are in Washington District, with some extending all the way into Roane County; but one of the largest, Grasslick Creek, lies mostly in Ripley District. Its upper waters flow out of the hills east of Garnes Knob, and the creek flows northward past the village of Kenna, continuing northward for more than three miles, accumulating numerous smaller tributaries, including Pleasant Valley Run, the Shamblen Branch, and the Coleman Branch, all coming from the west. It then meets Grasslick Run, flowing from the north out of the hills above Fairplain, and curves around a ridge, traveling southeast for two miles, until it meets Stonelick Creek, coming from the south above Plum Orchard; Gin Run is an upper tributary of Stonelick Creek. Turning east, Grasslick Creek flows past Plum Orchard, and meets Plum Orchard Run coming from the south, before flowing eastward into Washington District. In Washington District, Grasslick Creek meets the Bear Fork to form the Tug Fork of Mill Creek. At Ripley, Mill Creek is joined by Sycamore Creek, coming from the east, and flowing around the plateau where the town was built; the Left Fork of Sycamore flows out of the hills north of Ripley. Below the town, Bullfrog Run, Burnt Run, and Claylick Run flow into Mill Creek from the Northwest, and the creek turns westward toward the district boundary. Before leaving Ripley District, Mill Creek is joined by Parchment Creek, coming from the south; Mud Run, flowing from the north; and Isaacs Run, running northeast past the village of Evans. Parchment Creek has an extensive watershed, with its upper course flowing out of the hills southeast of Given, where it meets with Wolfe Creek. Continuing northward, it meets with Kissel Run, coming from the west, then the Cox Fork, flowing from the east out of the hollows south of Reynolds Hill. Above the village of Parchment Valley, the creek meets with Wolfpen Run, flowing northeast, then below the village with Grass Run, flowing southwest. Parchment Creek continues westward, meeting with Bull Run, coming from the south, then Roundknob Run, flowing northeast from Danstown, and Johns Run, where the creek turns northward toward Mill Creek. Other streams in Ripley District include the Left Fork of the Pocatalico River, which drains the southern portion of the district; the upper course of Thirteenmile Creek, which flows out of Douglas Hollow above the village of Rockcastle, then flows northwest into Mason County; and the upper waters of Eighteenmile Creek, most of which is in Putnam County. The Left Fork of the Pocatalico is formed in Ripley District by the confluence of Pocatalico Creek and the Dudden Fork, south of Goldtown. Above Goldtown, Pocatalico Creek is joined by the Dog Fork, which curves through Jackson, Putnam, and Kanawha Counties, before returning to Jackson County in its lower course. Before leaving Jackson County, the Left Fork is joined by the Spicewood Branch, coming from the west. The southernmost portion of the boundary separating Ripley District from Kanawha County follows the course of the Left Fork. =Communities= The only incorporated settlement in Ripley District is the city of Ripley, located on a plateau overlooking Mill Creek, in the northern part of the district. It is the county seat, and home of the Jackson County Courthouse. For most of its history, Ripley has been the second-largest town in Jackson County, behind Ravenswood, on the Ohio River.United States Census Bureau, United States Decennial Census, 1870‚Äì2010. Besides the town of Ripley, the district is home to a number of unincorporated communities. Further up the main branch of Mill Creek, the village of Shatto is about five miles above Ripley. In the central part of the district, Kenna lies at the headwaters of Grasslick Creek, while Fairplain is on Grasslick Run, a tributary of the former. Plum Orchard lies along the lower course of Grasslick Creek, just before it crosses into Washington District. On the Left Fork of Sycamore Creek, which joins Mill Creek just below Ripley, is the village of Sidneyville. Parchment Valley, as its name suggests, lies in the valley of Parchment Creek, about four miles above the mouth of that stream. The village of Given is about four miles above Parchment Valley. Below Parchment Valley is Mount Moriah, on a hill overlooking a bend in the creek, opposite the mouth of Bull Run. Danstown is on Roundknob Run, the next tributary of Parchment Creek below Mount Moriah. Foster Chapel, West Virginia is in the hills south of Danstown. The village of Evans is on Isaacs Run, in the western part of the district. In the southern part of the district, Goldtown lies along Pocatalico Creek, while the village of Loop is further downstream, on the Left Fork of the Pocatalico River, near the southernmost corner of Ripley District. The former village of Edgar is in the hills above the headwaters of Eighteenmile Creek. Rockcastle is on the upper waters of Thirteenmile Creek, in a portion of the district that belonged to Mason County until 1866. =Roads and transportation= The main north-south highway in Ripley District is County Road 21, which runs between Charleston and Parkersburg, through the center of the district. South of Ripley, it is known locally as the Charleston Road, and runs past Loop, Goldtown, Kenna, and Fairplain; south of Kenna it is joined by West Virginia Route 34, coming from Red House in Putnam County. North of Ripley, County Road 21 becomes the Parkersburg Road. The main east-west highway is West Virginia Route 62, formerly part of U.S. Route 33 west of Ripley, which runs to Cottageville, and then on to Ripley Landing, along the Ohio River in Union District. Continuing through Ripley, it becomes Main Street and U.S. Route 33, otherwise known as the Spencer Road, traveling eastward to Spencer in Roane County. Interstate 77 runs through the district, roughly paralleling County Road 21, with exits at Goldtown, Fairplain, and Ripley, on its way from Charleston to Parkersburg. For most of the twentieth century, a spur line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, known as the Ripley Branch, traveled between Millwood and Ripley. History To a large extent, the history of Ripley District is synonymous with that of the town of Ripley. The first settler was William Parsons, who built a log cabin on a plateau overlooking Mill Creek. He later sold this land to Jacob Starcher. Until 1831, the land that would become Jackson County was part of Mason, Wood, and Kanawha Counties; most of Ripley District was part of Mason County, except for the southernmost portion, which was in Kanawha County. Soon after Jackson County's formation, the town of Ripley was chosen as the county seat. The town began to take shape between 1828 and 1832, on land donated by Jacob Starcher and his wife, Anna; they and several of their relatives were key to the town's development. It was named in honour of Harry Ripley, a young man who had recently drowned in Mill Creek, shortly before he was to be married. A log schoolhouse was built in 1829, and the first schoolmaster was John Armstrong, later a physician at Ripley. The first county court was held at the house of Joel Sayre, Jacob Starcher's son-in-law, in 1831;\\"Organization of Jackson County\\", in Hardesty's Biographical Atlas of Jackson County. the following year a courthouse was erected at what became the Ripley town square,\\"Public Buildings\\", in Hardesty's Biographical Atlas of Jackson County. and Robert Lowther was appointed the first postmaster of Jackson Court House, as the post office was officially named.United States Post Office Department, Record of Appointment of Postmasters, 1832‚Äì1971, NARA Microfilm Publication M841, Virginia, Fluvanna‚ÄìJefferson Counties, p. 95. The town soon flourished, as merchants Alfred Beauchamp and James and Nehemiah Smith opened stores in 1833, and hotels were established the same year by William Carney and Jacob Staats, the latter a brother-in-law of Jacob Starcher. Staats' son-in-law, Joseph Bolen, opened a blacksmith shop at Ripley in 1834. Jacob Starcher built a water-powered floating grist mill in 1836, and soon afterward established the town's first sawmill. Joseph Mairs was the town's first physician, and a Methodist church was built at Ripley about 1840. The original courthouse was replaced by a new structure, built by Nicholas H. Bonnett, also a son-in-law of Jacob Staats, in 1858. A woolen mill came to Ripley in 1866. Prior to the civil war, most counties in Virginia were not subdivided into smaller units. Jackson County was one of forty-eight Virginia counties admitted to the Union as the state of West Virginia on June 20, 1863. On July 31 of that year, the West Virginia Legislature passed an act requiring the division of the counties into civil townships. Section five of the bill appointed George L. Kennedy, John Johnson, Robert R. Riley, Abraham Slaughter, and George Click to establish Jackson County's townships. Mill Creek Township, later Ripley, was one of the five original townships of Jackson County; it was given its present name in 1871. The original purpose of the townships was to provide for local government, as well as local control over revenue and the newly-created system of free public schools. However, the rural nature of the state proved an impediment to participation in township government, and revenues fell far below expectations. In 1872, the townships were converted into magisterial districts, serving various administrative purposes, but having no governmental function.Otis K. Rice & Stephen W. Brown, West Virginia: A History, 2nd ed., University Press of Kentucky, Lexington (1993), p. 240. The only major change in the boundaries of any of Jackson County's historic districts occurred in 1866, when a trapezoidal section of eastern Union Township in Mason County, surrounding the village of Rockcastle and the upper waters of Thirteenmile Creek, was transferred to Mill Creek Township in Jackson County.Michael F. Doran, Atlas of County Boundary Changes in Virginia, 1634‚Äì1895, Iberian Publishing Company, Athens, Georgia (c. 1987). Otherwise, the names and boundaries of Jackson County's magisterial districts remained largely unchanged until the 1990s, when the county was redistricted in order to equalize the area and population of its magisterial districts as nearly as possible. The western portions of Ripley District, excluding the town of Ripley, were combined with Union District and the southwestern portion of Ravenswood District, to form the new Western Magisterial District. The eastern part of Ripley District, together with the city of Ripley, were combined with Washington District to form the new Eastern Magisterial District. However, redistricting in a number of counties created confusion with land and tax records, so the legislature provided for the establishment of tax districts, following the lines of the historic magisterial districts, and serving all administrative functions other than the apportionment of county officials. As a result, Ripley District remains an administrative unit of Jackson County, although it is no longer one of the magisterial districts.

Ward, 470 U.S. 869 (1985), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that a state can not tax out-of-state insurance companies at a greater rate than domestic insurance companies under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article Four of the United States Constitution.. Facts and procedural history Alabama passed a law which imposed greatly lower gross premiums tax rate on Alabama-based insurance companies than on out-of-state or foreign insurance companies. The statute permitted these out-of-state companies to invest in Alabama assets and securities, which could reduce (though not eliminate) the higher tax. Out-of- state insurance companies brought claims for refunds of taxes paid. They argued that the tax plan violated the Equal Protection Clause of the US Constitution. The State Commissioner of Insurance denied the claims. Alabama's court of first instance upheld the statute on summary judgment, finding that the statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The Court reasoned that, among the legitimate state purposes are encouraging the formation of new insurance companies in Alabama and capital investment by foreign insurance companies in Alabama assets and securities, not to mention raising revenue via taxation. Thus, the distinction between foreign and domestic companies which was rationally related to those purposes, was acceptable. After two appeals, the Supreme Court of Alabama upheld these findings, and the case was brought to the United States Supreme Court. Supreme Court Justice Powell, writing for the 5-4 majority, held two things. First, under the circumstances of the case, promotion of domestic business by discriminating against nonresidents is not a legitimate state purpose. The Court here distinguished this case from Western & Southern Life Ins. Co. v. State Board of Equalization of California. The law had no purpose but to burden foreign businesses for the benefit of Alabama businesses. This was, according to the Court, exactly the sort of behavior the Equal Protection Clause was written to prohibit. A state may not incur a higher tax on a business solely based on the state of one's residence. The Court noted that while the McCarran-Ferguson Act did take the insurance industry outside the purview of Commerce Clause restrictions, that did not extend to the Equal Protection Clause. While the doctrines are related, the Act did not stop both. Second, promotion of investing in Alabama industry was a legitimate state interest. All insurance companies, domestic and foreign, were entitled to the tax breaks for the investment credits. However, because investment credits could not eliminate, but only lessen the tax burden on foreign insurance companies, this further demonstrated the unconstitutionality of Alabama's tax scheme. =Dissenting opinion= Justice O'Connor wrote a dissent joined by Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Rehnquist. It argued that promoting domestic industry was a legitimate state interest, and the tax scheme was related to this purpose.

A. Burke (Kevin Charles Anthony Burke, November 13, 1929 - March 21, 2018) was a geologist known for his contributions in the theory of plate tectonics. In the course of his life, Burke held multiple professorships, most recent of which (1983-2018) was the position of professor of geology and tectonics at the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Science, University of Houston. His studies on plate tectonics, deep mantle processes, sedimentology, erosion, soil formation and other topics extended over several decades and influenced multiple generations of geologists and geophysicists around the world. Biography = Early life and education = Kevin Burke was born on November 13, 1929 in London, England, to a cultured family of Irish descent. He obtained his B.Sc. degree from University College London in 1951, and a Ph.D. degree from the University of London in 1953. His Ph.D. study focused on mapping and dating Barrovian metamorphic rocks and granites in the Connemara area of western Ireland. = Scientific work = From 1953 to 1972, Burke held a series of teaching and research positions in geology, including a lecturer position at the University College of the Gold Coast (now the University of Ghana, 1953‚Äì1956) and a senior geologist position at the Atomic Energy Division of the British Geological Survey (1956‚Äì1961). While at the British Geological Survey, he worked in the east African rift and in South Korea. During that time he married his lifelong companion, Angela Marion Burke. From 1961 to 1965, Burke was the head of the Geology Department at the University of the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica, and held a position of the head of the Geology Department at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria, from 1965 to 1972. A critical turn in Burke's career occurred in 1972‚Äì1973 when he became a visiting professor at the University of Toronto, Canada. There, he became a close associate of J. Tuzo Wilson, who at that time was one of the most prominent proponents of plate tectonics and studies of volcanic hotspots. During his time in Toronto with Wilson, Burke began a lifelong study of hotspots, rifting and mantle processes, which was enhanced by his previous field experiences in Africa and the Caribbean. In 1973, Burke was invited by John F. Dewey to join the faculty at the State University of New York at Albany, which had assembled a group of geoscientists interested in plate tectonics, hotspot studies, rifting, and field-based ophiolite studies. During his 10-year residence in Albany, Burke produced many seminal papers on continental rifting, hotspots, Caribbean tectonics, and the effects of continent-continent collision in Asia and other places. In 1983, Burke joined the faculty of the University of Houston and also worked as director and associate director of the Lunar and Planetary Institute at NASA in Houston until 1988. In the 1990s and 2000s, in addition to mentoring graduate students and teaching at the University of Houston, he held many visiting professorships at NASA, JPL, UCLA, Carnegie Institute, and the University of Oslo, Norway. From 2003 and until his death in 2018, Kevin Burke worked in close collaboration with Trond H. Torsvik, who was then the head of the Geodynamics research group at the Geological Survey of Norway and later became a professor of geology at the University of Oslo, Norway. This collaboration resulted in several seminal contributions, describing the causal links between the two large-scale structures in the lowermost part of the Earth mantle (Large Low Shear-wave Velocity Provinces, or LLSVPs), the large-scale geometry of mantle convection, mantle plumes and surface hotspot volcanism. Burke was the first who recognized that the most prominent mantle plumes feeding active hotspots rose from the margins of LLSVPs, which he termed the \\"Plume Generation Zones\\" (PGZs). Evidence for long-term stability of LLSVPs (over time scales of hundreds of millions of years) from paleogeographic reconstructions of large igneous provinces and kimberlites, led Burke and Torsvik to develop a new approach to absolute plate reconstructions (PGZ method), in which the geological records of hotspot volcanism are used to constrain the longitudinal positions of lithospheric plates in the originally unconstrained reconstructions based on paleomagnetism. This work stimulated renewed interest to the LLSVPs in the geosciences community, resulting in a growing number of studies aimed to address the origin and evolution of the LLSVP structures in the lowermost mantle. The long-term temporal stability of LLSVPs has not yet been fully accepted by the scientific community and remains a field of on-going debate and active research. = Professional communities = Over his entire scientific career, Kevin Burke was a very active member of the geological and geophysical scientific community. Burke was a member of the Geological Society of London, the Geological Society of America, the American Geophysical Union, the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, the European Geosciences Union, the Nigerian Mining Geological and Metallurgical Society, the Nigerian Association of Petroleum Explorationists, and the Houston Geological Society. He also served on many national committees, including the National Science Foundation, the National Research Council, NASA, and the National Academy of Sciences. = Death = Kevin Burke died of a heart attack at the age of 88. He died at Addison Gilbert Hospital in Gloucester, Massachusetts, on March 21, 2018. Burke was survived by a brother and sister, three children and two grandchildren. The EOS magazine of the American Geophysical Union paid a tribute to Kevin Burke by publishing an article, in which he was described as a \\"complete geologist of the ilk of Charles Lyell, Alexander von Humboldt, Eduard Suess, or Arthur Holmes.\\"  Awards and honors  Burke's lifetime achievement awards include the Geological Society of America (GSA) Structural Geology and Tectonics Career Contribution Award (2004); the Penrose Medal, the highest award of the Geological Society of America (2007); and the Arthur Holmes Medal and Honorary Membership, one of the most prestigious awards of the European Geosciences Union (2014).  Terms and acronyms  * core-mantle boundary (LLSVPs, TUZO and JASON).

Right panel: Schematic vertical cross-section of the Earth's mantle through the Plume Generation Zone (PGZ). Redrawn from Torsvik et al. (2016). Kevin Burke coined the term \\"Wilson Cycle\\" for the sequence of continental rifting, ocean opening, ocean closure, and continent‚Äìcontinent collision, which was originally suggested by J. Tuzo Wilson in 1966. * Being a vocal advocate for the stability of LLSVPs, Burke suggested referring to the LLSVP residing under the African plate as \\"TUZO\\" (the acronym stands for \\"The Unmoved ZOne of the Earth mantle\\" and commemorates J. Tuzo Wilson), and to the one under the Pacific Ocean ‚Äî as \\"JASON\\" (\\"Just As Stable ON the opposite meridian,\\" after W. Jason Morgan, an influential American geophysicist known for his seminal works on plate tectonics and mantle plumes). *Another acronym introduced by Kevin Burke is \\"TANYA,\\" which is the name for a smaller-scale structure of anomalously low shear-wave velocity (Low Shear-wave Velocity Province or LSVP, not to be confused with LLSVP) residing in the lowermost mantle underneath the western coast of North America. The acronym stands for \\"The Anomalous Near Yellowstone Area\\" and is presumably a tribute to Tanya Atwater, an American marine geophysicist renowned for her research on the plate tectonic history of western North America. * The term \\"Burkian Earth\\" was used by Torsvik and co- workers for a simple conceptual model of the Earth as a stable \\"degree-two planet.\\" On the Burkian Earth, mantle flow is dominated by small-scale convection in the upper mantle, whereas circulation in the lower mantle is mostly restricted to sinking lithospheric slabs and mantle plumes rising from the margins of two stable and antipodal LLSVPs (hence degree two). Subduction zones concentrate along a meridian between the two LLSVPs (resembling the Pacific ‚Äúring of fire‚Äù); hence, slabs sinking all the way to the lowermost mantle also relate to long-wavelength lower-mantle structure dominated by the degree two term.

He made his professional debut in 1935, reaching the top makuuchi division in 1942. His highest rank was komusubi. He was twice runner-up in a tournament and earned seven gold stars for defeating yokozuna and four special prizes. He retired in 1959 at the age of 38 and became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association, working as a coach at Isegahama stable until his mandatory retirement in 1985. Career He was a member of the Isegahama stable, a strong stable run by former sekiwake Kiyosegawa that also had yokozuna Terukuni and sekiwake Bish≈´yama at the time. He fought in the top division for 54 tournaments, which at the time of his retirement was the most ever, winning 352 matches and losing 395, with 19 absences. His best result in a tournament was in November 1944, where at the rank of maegashira 14 he won nine out of his ten bouts, the same as ≈çzeki Maedayama, but as he was the lower ranking wrestler he had to settle for runner-up honours as there was no playoff system at the time. Thirteen years later in September 1957 he was again runner-up, with a 12‚Äì3 record, one win behind yokozuna Tochinishiki. He had to withdraw from the November 1946 tournament through injury, as did Terukuni and Bishuyama, a rare example of three wrestlers from the same stable all missing a tournament. Over his long career he defeated yokozuna seven times, with two wins against Haguroyama, three against Kagamisato, one against Tochinishiki and one against Chiyonoyama. (He had another win over Chiyonoyama by default, which did not count as a kinboshi.) He spent just one tournament in the titled sanyaku ranks, at komusubi in September 1950, where he scored 7‚Äì8. He won the prestigious ginosho, or Technique Prize on three occasions, the final time coming in November 1958 at the age of thirty eight years and nine months. This made him the oldest winner of a sansh≈ç until Kyokutenh≈ç surpassed him in November 2014. He also won one Fighting Spirit prize, or kantosho, for his second runner-up performance. Retirement from sumo Just one tournament after his final Technique prize, Wakasegawa withdrew on the second day of the January 1959 tournament with an ankle injury and announced his retirement after it ended. He became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association under the name Asakayama. He worked under his former stablemate Terukuni, who had run Araiso stable since his own retirement in 1953, renamed Isegahama stable from 1961. After Terukuni's death in 1977 he worked under the former ≈çzeki Kiyokuni. He reached the mandatory retirement age in 1985 and left the Sumo Association.He also worked as a sumo commentator for NHK. He died in 1993 at the age of 73 of pancreatic cancer. Fighting style Wakasegawa was a yotsu- sumo wrestler, preferring grappling techniques which involved grabbing the opponent's mawashi or belt. His most common winning kimarite was yori-kiri, a straightforward force out. However he was also fond of sotogake, the outer leg trip, winning almost 15 percent of his top division matches this way.

After the fire, architect Pulgher developed a neoclassical shopping arcade project for the cleared area and this project was built by the Ottoman Armenian merchant Onnik D√ºz in 1874. Initially the arcade was illuminated by gas lamps placed in front of its famous mirrors, giving rise to its other name \\"Aynalƒ± Pasaj\\". In the early years shops in the arcade included a shoemaker, two hairdressers, two tailors, a grocery store, a haberdasher, two soap-makers and a carpet seller. In the following years, businesses such as florists, watchmakers, piano manufacturers and fashion houses were also established in the building. Today, businesses in the mall are dominated by souvenir, antique, clothing and jewelry stores selling items such as postcards, china and carpets.

Rutherford had a three-year college career with Oklahoma State, where as a senior in 1995 he helped the Cowboys make their first Final Four appearance in 45 years. He went on to play professionally in Spain, Finland, Cyprus and Australia. With the Brisbane Bullets in Australia, he led the league in scoring and earned All-NBL Second Team honors in 2002. Early life Born in Idabel, Oklahoma, Rutherford was raised in the nearby football-crazed town of Broken Bow. He grew up playing football, but gave it up to concentrate on basketball. He also played baseball as a child alongside his five brothers. Rutherford attended Broken Bow High School, where he played three years of basketball for the Savages. He averaged 28.6 points and 14.6 rebounds as a senior in 1989‚Äì90, leading Class 4A in scoring while finishing second in rebounding. He had a 49-point performance during the season and was named the Oklahoma Basketball Coaches Association's 1990 Player of the Year. He was also a successful long jumper in high school. College career In the fall of 1989, Rutherford signed a letter of intent with the Oklahoma State Cowboys. However, by the end of his senior year at Broken Bow, he had not qualified academically for Division I after not meeting Proposition 48 guidelines. Rutherford initially indicated he would attend OSU and sit out the 1990‚Äì91 season after learning he was only one point shy of the necessary 18 on his ACT. But two weeks after making his decision public, he changed his mind. Rather than miss a season of basketball, Rutherford enrolled at Bacone College. His plan was to graduate from Bacone in three semesters and then transfer to OSU midway through his sophomore year. During the 1990‚Äì91 season, Rutherford averaged 17 points and five rebounds for the Warriors. In November 1991, Rutherford signed a financial aid agreement with OSU. He successfully transferred to OSU midterm and redshirted in the spring of 1992 to maintain three years of eligibility. Rutherford was a three-year letterman for Oklahoma State from 1992‚Äì95. He had a memorable senior season, averaging 19.6 points and 8.4 rebounds per game during the Cowboys' 1994‚Äì95 campaign. He had 45 points with 11 3-pointers in a game against the Kansas Jayhawks on March 1, 1995. He finished as the Big Eight Conference record-holder for 3-pointers in a season and a career, while earning All-Big Eight honors and making the Big Eight's all-defensive team. He led the team to a Big Eight Tournament championship and the Cowboys' first Final Four appearance in 45 years, helping the Cowboys put together a memorable NCAA Tournament run, upsetting No. 1 Wake Forest and No. 2 UMass. In a Sweet Sixteen victory over Wake Forest, Rutherford had 23 points and 11 rebounds, and in the East Regional final, he scored 19 points in a win over UMass to earn Oklahoma State's first Final Four appearance since 1951. Oklahoma State lost to eventual national champion UCLA 74‚Äì61 in the semifinals, despite Rutherford's 15 points. He averaged 18.2 points in five NCAA Tournament games. In 99 collegiate games over his three-year career, Rutherford averaged 15.6 points, 5.9 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 1.2 steals per game. Professional career A lack of height and poor performances in numerous NBA draft camps, combined with a court appearance in May 1995, led to Rutherford dropping to second- round pick contention in the 1995 NBA draft. He ultimately went undrafted and was picked up by the Oklahoma City Cavalry in the third round of the CBA draft in September 1995. He did not join the Cavalry however, deciding instead to return to OSU to complete his degree. In October 1996, Rutherford signed with the Oklahoma City Cavalry. He began the 1996‚Äì97 season with the Cavalry, but left the team after just three games. He subsequently moved to Spain, where he played in the second division for Andorra. In 13 games during the 1996‚Äì97 LEB season, he averaged 14.9 points per game. For the 1997‚Äì98 season, Rutherford played in Finland for KTP Basket. He moved to Cyprus for the 1998‚Äì99 season, where he played for PAEEK. For the 1999‚Äì2000 season, Rutherford moved to Australia to play for the Canberra Cannons in the NBL. In 28 games for the Cannons, he averaged 23.9 points, 5.0 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 1.0 steals per game. Rutherford remained in the NBL for the 2000‚Äì01 season, joining the Brisbane Bullets. In 27 games in his first season with the Bullets, he averaged 19.3 points, 5.2 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 1.1 steals per game. In his second season with the Bullets, Rutherford earned All-NBL Second Team honors and led the league in scoring with 25.0 points per game. In 30 games, he also averaged 5.9 rebounds, 2.8 assists and 1.2 steals per game. His third season with the Bullets ended prematurely after he was cut with three games to go. In 26 games, he averaged 17.4 points, 5.7 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.1 steals per game. On July 22, 2003, Rutherford signed with APOEL of the Cyprus Basketball League. After failing to satisfy the coach, he was released on September 2, 2003, prior to the start of the season. Coaching career After retiring from playing basketball, Rutherford returned to OSU and served as an assistant strength and conditioning coach for four years. He was on the coaching staff in 2004 when the Cowboys went back to the Final Four in the NCAA Tournament. In May 2008, Rutherford was appointed head coach of the boys basketball team at Tulsa Central. In his lone season as coach of the Braves, he guided Central to an area tournament championship and an appearance in the Class 4A State Tournament. The Braves, who played against many Class 5A and Class 6A teams during the regular season, finished 13‚Äì13. In March 2009, Rutherford resigned as coach of Central to become the men's coach at Murray State College. He coached at Murray State for two years. In July 2018, Rutherford was appointed head coach of the boys basketball team at McLain High School in Tulsa.

The Watkins 27P design was developed from the commercially successful Watkins 27, by adding a pilothouse and making changes to the mast height and sail area. Production The design was built by Watkins Yachts in Clearwater, Florida, United States. A total of seven examples were completed, with all constructed in 1981. Development The boat was initiated as \\"one-off\\" custom design for a customer, using the Watkins 27 hull and deck as a basis. Once completed, the company decided to put the design into production to compete with Morgan Yachts and Pearson Yachts, which were also producing pilothouse yachts at that time. The prototype was used to create a mould for the pilothouse, the mast was then shortened, the boom raised to clear the pilothouse and the sailplan was adjusted accordingly. Design The Watkins 27P is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of polyester resin-based fiberglass, with teak wood trim. Plywood coring is used in the structures of the cabin roof, the deck, seats and cockpit sole for additional stiffness. It has a masthead sloop rig with 6061-T6 aluminum spars, a raked stem, a vertical transom, a skeg- mounted rudder controlled by a wheel and a shoal-draft keel. It displaces and carries of ballast. The boat has a draft of with the standard shoal-draft keel fitted. The boat is fitted with a Japanese Yanmar diesel engine. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . Sleeping accommodation is provided for five people and consists of a bow \\"V\\" berth, a main cabin settee berth and a double-sized quarter berth. The head is fully enclosed and located to port aft of the forward cabin. The galley is aft, on the starboard side and includes an icebox and a two-burner alcohol or gas-fired stove mounted on gimbals. Ventilation is provided by six opening ports. The main cabin has of standing headroom. All woodwork is teak, including the cabin accents, bulkheads and the cabinets, which are teak veneer over plywood. The cabin sole is a teak parquet design.

The show first aired in 1967.  History  Berend Boudewijn presented the show in 1967, 1968 and 1969. The show returned in 1989 and Kees Driehuis was the presenter of the show for 29 years. Driehuis presented the show for the last time on 1 March 2018 and in total he presented 794 episodes of the quiz show. Erik Dijkstra is the presenter of the show.  Format  The format of the show has seen small changes over the years but has remained largely unchanged at its core. A contestant is faced with four 'questions' or challenges and each question consists of nine possible answers. These answers are presented to the contestant at the beginning of each question and the goal is to match the answers with images that are presented afterwards. For example, the contestant may be given the names of famous buildings and the contestant needs to provide a correct answer when images of these buildings are shown. The contestant is allowed to change previous answers as the question progresses and the contestant is not required to have provided an answer for each image. The contestant is given 200 seconds to complete all the 'questions' or challenges in an episode of the show and it's up to the contestant to say \\"stop\\" to stop the clock. After each question the host reviews the answers with the contestant to determine whether the contestant has provided enough correct answers to advance to the next question. The contestant is also given two 'jokers' at the beginning of the game and additional jokers are given over the course of the game. A contestant can choose to use these before the answers are evaluated to guard against an incorrect answer. Using a joker reduces the amount of available time for the contestant in the remainder of the game. Deciding to use a joker can be useful in case the contestant is not confident about the provided answers but equally the contestant may end up using one or more jokers unnecessarily.

Common foods include baguettes and croissants with coffee for breakfast, ratatouille, coq au vin, bouillabaisse, which all show their French heritage or South Indian meals such as masala dosa, sambar or idly. French influence While a French colony, the local cuisine was downplayed. \\"Leaving aside the food of the Indian class, which does most of the time consist of boiled rice seasoned with a scanty patch of grass or fish, we will provide only some details about the European diet. [...]\\" Food in Pondicherry is strongly influenced by the French. Salade ni√ßoise, cr√™pes (both sweet and savoury) and cr√®me br√ªl√©e are among popular French dishes still prepared in Pondicherry. Multiple French restaurants are located in the area, including bakeries, caf√©s, seafood restaurants and traditional French restaurants. There was also much cross-pollination between Pondicherry and South Asia and Vietnam (both were under French control) as people travelled between these two locations for business, for administration and as part of the armed forces. Tamil food was \\"refined\\" by French influence, using much less spice. Indian influence Fish market in Pondicherry; being close to the ocean, fish is abundant. The cuisine from the neighbouring Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala have also influenced the cuisine of Pondicherry. Recently growth of North Indian community at Pondicherry brought many North Indian chaat shops to Pondicherry. Fusion and Creole cuisine Given the history of the area, local cuisine is a fusion of many cultures. Dosas made like crepes with meat and cheese instead of masala are an example. Chaiyos (a kind of Vietnamese spring roll made from rice flour) also appear in local restaurants. Vindaloo is different than in Goa (a result of the area‚Äôs Portuguese past). Prawn malay curry also shows influence from South East Asia. Pondicherrian Fish Assad Curry, a coconut-milk-laden curry, flavoured with anise and curry leaves and finished with a squeeze of lime is a \\"quintessential\\" local dish. Bouillabaisse morphed into Meen Puyabaise with turmeric to suit the French palate. With the passage of time, local creole dishes have slowly begun to fade from restaurants in Pondicherry, with some older residents attempting to keep these dishes alive by offering classes in their homes on how to prepare them.

It is the oldest currently active police band in the United States and serves as the official musical unit of the MPD. It is composed of both civilian and police personnel who volunteer to work with the band. The band is funded by the Milwaukee Police Athletic Association, due none of the city budget being available to fund its operations. The MPD band performs regularly at events such as Peace Officers Memorial Day, graduation ceremonies and other Civic functions.https://urbanmilwaukee.com/event/milwaukee-police-band-live- at-the-peck/ History In the fall 1897, the Milwaukee Police Band became the first police ensemble to be formed in the United States, coming 13 years after the first police band one was formed in Australia.https://radiomilwaukee.org/story/arts-culture/the-oldest-police- band-in-the-country-right-here-in-milwaukee/ It was originally composed of a group of whistlers who worked in the MPD. 9 April 1898, 5 months after its founding, the band performed at its first concert to members of the MPD, playing the Star Spangled Banner, El Capitan and Yankee Doodle.https://pabsttheater.org/event/milwaukeepoliceband2018/https://www.marcuscenter.org/show/milwaukee- police-band-2018https://www.milwaukee365.com/event/live-at-peck-pavilion- milwaukee-police-band/ On 7 October 1922, the band met former United States Marine Band director John Philip Sousa at a train station and played for him when he visited Milwaukee to perform with the MPD Band alongside the Sousa Band at the Milwaukee Auditorium. It performed again with the band in mid- November 1923, during which Sousa presented the band with an American flag that included with streamers with Sousa's name embroidered. Under the direction of Robert O. Brunkhorst, the band became a regular feature on WISN (AM) radio, as well as other emerging radio stations in the region. The MPD Jazz Ensemble was formed in the 1940s to increase the diversity in music played by the band as it was a rising trend during that period. In October 1993, the Band was invited to appear at the Wisconsin Music Educators Association Music Conference in Madison, Wisconsin, during which they demonstrated their approach to establishing youth programs. In March 2000, the expansion of the MPD Band youth saw younger children being introduced included and paired with police officer-musicians who mentored and performed with the students.

The members of the council were elected by the people of Isfahan and Nurollah Najafi Isfahani chaired the council. The association was formed between years 1906 and 1908, namely from the migration of Qom to the 1908 bombardment of the Majlis at the Fort of Chehel Sotoun in Isfahan. History Following the Persian Constitutional Revolution, the people of Isfahan were able to expel Mass'oud Mirza Zell-e Soltan from Isfahan by pursuing their protests and rallies led by Aqa Najafi Isfahani. After that, the Isfahan National Holy Association was responsibe of Isfahan city administration, whose members were elected by the people through free elections. Members Place of members in the Isfahan National Holy Association. This image was published in the Jahade Akbar newspaper. Members of the Isfahan National Holy Association were: * Haj Agha Nourollah Najafi Isfahani, Seyed Abolghasem Zanjani and Sheikh Morteza Rizi from the Ulama guild election * Mohammad Ibrahim Malek al-Tojjar and Mohammad Hussein Kazerouni from the trade union election * Hassan Bonakdar and Mahmoud Bonakdar from guild class election * Mirza Mohammad Ali Kalbasi and Hassan Modarres from the mullahs guild election * Mirza Ali Akbar Sheikh al-Islam Actions Among the features of the Isfahan National Holy Association and the important actions of its founding clerics are the following: * Extensive and unparalleled mobilization of the people to support the goals of the Persian Constitutional Revolution * The establishment of dozens of political and provincial associations * Efforts to be accountable public officials and spreading the spirit of rational inquiry * Effective measures to reform military, financial, commercial, regional welfare and economic services * Efforts to establish new social institutions such as new banks and schools The Isfahan National Holy Association in comparison with to the other contemporary communities, has been one of the most prolific and endorsing examples in the country. Factor that caused tension in the relationship between the National Consultative Assembly and the Isfahan National Holy Association was the issue of the entry of the former ruler into the Isfahan and the serious opposition of the people and the Isfahan National Holy Association. This was despite the National Consultative Assembly strong request. Isfahan National Holy Association Newspaper The newspaper of the Isfahan National Holy Association was published 15 days after the formation of the Association on 5 January 1907, reflecting the summary of the negotiations of the members of the Association. Expressing the principles of constitutionality and citing urban events was the focus of this newspaper's articles. Serajuddin Jebel Ameli Mousavi was the editor of this newspaper. The first 78 volume of this newspaper was published in the Isfahan by Mohammad Ali Chelunger efforts, sponsored by Isfahan Recreational Cultural Organization. The subtle point in the headline of this newspaper is the conversion of Gregorian calendar to Solar Hijri calendar without mentioning the Iranian months. This change may be seen as a reaction to the foreigners and honoring the National Iranian calendar, which was undoubtedly due to the growing nationalism among Iranian people. The same attitude prompted the British Embassy's secretary to report to his country about two Isfahan newspapers (the Isfahan National Holy Association newspaper and the Jahade Akbar newspaper), especially those who spoke out against foreigners.

The show was later made available on demand on the High Spots network. The show featured several inter-promotional matches between The Crash wrestlers and wrestlers from Impact Wrestling (IW) who were also a part of the larger WrestleCon event. In the main event Austin Aries defeated The Crash representative Penta el 0M in a match where Aries' Impact World Championship was not on the line. The show also featured the one-night reunion of the Latino World Order (lWo) in the semi-main event as Dami√°n 666, L.A.

While the operation failed to completely destroy OPM's presence, the organization was considerably weakened militarily from its losses. Background Following the New York Agreement, administration of Western New Guinea was transferred from the Netherlands (as Netherlands New Guinea) to Indonesia. The agreement contained provisions for self- determination for the West Papuans, which resulted in the controversial Act of Free Choice in July 1969, whereas around 1,000 selected representatives all voted unanimously for incorporation. The representatives had no members which were opposed to unification, and by July 1971 the Free Papua Movement issued a proclamation of independence for \\"The Republic of West Papua New Guinea\\". Containing both a political and a military wing, the OPM was the only organization which conducted armed opposition against Indonesia, with its military consisting primarily of irregular fighters with few regulars. OPM's primary base of operations at the time, also known as Markas Victoria (Victoria Base), was located southeast of Jayapura, around the Keerom region. Operations Following an aerial bombardment by two OV-10 Bronco aircraft, around 10,000 soldiers were dropped onto the area south of Jayapura near the border with Papua New Guinea. The number of Indonesian soldiers involved were around 10,000, with reports reaching up to 16,000 soldiers. In the operation, OPM claimed that 425 Indonesian Army personnel were killed and 800 were wounded, while the Indonesian government stated that losses were minor. The OPM reported 1,605 killed, including armed regulars, sympathizers, and local villagers alike. According to OPM spokesmen located abroad, the organization still had a fighting strength of 3,000 to 5,000 men. Aftermath Brigadier general , the commander of the Papuan military region for the Indonesian Army, stated that the OPM had been \\"reduced to scattered remnants\\". The operation resulted in a significant setback for the OPM's military capabilities, but the Indonesian government failed to achieve its objective of destroying the organization by 1977. Richard Woolcott, Australian Ambassador to Indonesia at the time, visited the border regions in early 1977 and reported that there were \\"not more than twenty rebels\\", though armed conflict continued in the Papuan highlands. OPM was further weakened by an internal split, where OPM's leaders Jacob Prai and split ways, and most of OPM fighters joined Prai's organization. Though both leaders eventually were arrested in Papua New Guinea and went into asylum in Sweden, OPM remained active in Papua, with leaders such as Kelly Kwalik leading a number of small-scale military operations denying total control by the Indonesian Armed Forces.

The film was directed by Sebastian Jones and Ramez Silyan, produced by Benjamin Soley and executive produced by Terrence Malick, Liza Womack and Sarah Stennett. It chronicles the life of Lil Peep from his childhood in Long Beach, NY through his meteoric rise in the underground scene and music industry, up to his death on November 15, 2017 at the age of 21. The film takes its title from one of Lil Peep's Instagram posts, which appeared the day before his death. ‚ÄúI just wanna be everybody's everything,\\" he wrote. The documentary is described as a \\"humanistic portrait that seeks to understand an artist who attempted to be all things to all people.\\" The film had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 10, 2019 and was released by Gunpowder & Sky for one-night worldwide fan screenings on November 12 ahead of its theatrical release on November 15, 2019.

The rapper Drake called the film \\"genius\\" in an interview with Rap Radar and Justin Staple of Vice named it \\"The Defining Document of the SoundCloud Rap Generation.\\" The Playlist's Ryan Oliver writes: \\"Having only witnessed the quick meteoric rise of Lil Peep in the peripherals as it was unfolding, Everybody‚Äôs Everything is a loving tribute for fans as well as those unfamiliar.

It was known for its Individualist political views and its artwork by Walter Sickert and James Abbott McNeill Whistler. It was also strongly Jacobite and played a leading role in the Neo-Jacobite Revival of the 1890s.  History  Herbert Vivian, founder and editor of The Whirlwind Stuart Erskine founder of The Whirlwind = The revival of Jacobite sympathies = In 1886, Bertram Ashburnham circulated a leaflet seeking Jacobite sympathisers. Following the failed Jacobite rising of 1745, Jacobites had been suppressed and had only met in small secret gatherings. By the late 19th century, Jacobitism was no longer stigmatised, and Ashburnham's leaflet gathered a number of responses. Amongst those who replied was Melville Henry Massue. Massue and Ashburnham founded the Order of the White Rose, an openly Jacobite group. The Order was officially founded on 10 June 1866. The Order attracted Irish and Scottish Nationalists to its ranks. While these various interests gathered under the banner of restoring the House of Stuart, they also had a common streak against the scientific and secular democratic norms of the time. Some even planned (but did not execute) a military overthrow of the Hanoverian monarchy, with the aim of putting Princess Maria Theresa on the British throne. See Jacobite succession. Two early, and enthusiastic, members of the Order were Herbert Vivian and Ruaraidh Erskine. They had met at journalism school and were keen to pursue a political campaign of Jacobite restoration. In 1889, the New Gallery in London put on a major exhibition of works related to the House of Stuart. Queen Victoria lent a number of items to the exhibition, as did the wife of her son Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany; Jacobite families from England and Scotland donated items. The exhibition was hugely popular and provoked a widespread new interest in the Stuart monarchs.. The exhibition itself showed some distinctive Jacobite tendencies, as Guthrie points out in his book: > \\"It is clear that the point of the whole exhibition in the New Gallery ... > was a Stuart restoration and to bring the Jacobite fact and the modern > succession to the Stuart claim to the attention of the British public\\" = The founding of The Whirlwind = Portrait of Charles Bradlaugh MP, by Walter Sickert, from the first issue of The Whirlwind In 1890, Vivian and Erskine founded a literary weekly newspaper The Whirlwind, A Lively and Eccentric Newspaper, with Vivian as editor. The paper had an explicitly Jacobite viewpoint, as well as espousing an extreme form of Individualism. = The brief life of The Whirlwind = The Whirlwind was noted for publishing illustrations by artists including Whistler and Walter Sickert; Sickert was also the art critic of The Whirlwind, and wrote a weekly column. It also carried articles about Oscar Wilde at the height of his fame and notoriety. The paper espoused an Individualist and Jacobite political view, championed by Erskine and Vivian,. One of the notable illustrations produced by Sickert for The Whirlwind was a portrait of Charles Bradlaugh. Bradlaugh also wrote an article on \\"practical individualism\\" for the paper. Erskine's contributions to The Whirlwind tended towards more serious political discourse. He wrote in favour of a purely-voluntary taxation system and against women's suffrage. Vivian was drawn more to social events and personal attacks on those he disagreed with. He wrote a number of articles attacking Henry Morton Stanley, was scathing of London's tramway system on individualist grounds, and published his series \\"Letters to Absurd People\\" skewering various political figures including Arthur Balfour, George Goschen and Henry Edward Manning, the Archbishop of Westminster. The initial success of the paper emboldened Vivian and Erskine's political ambitions. In 1891, they split from The Order of the White Rose, and along with Massue they formed the Legitimist Jacobite League of Great Britain and Ireland. This was a much more politically motivated organization, while the Order was moving in a more artistic direction. Pittock describes the League as a \\"publicist for Jacobitism on a scale unwitnessed since the Eighteenth Century\\". In August 1890, the paper carried an article by W. H. Wilkins, a friend of Vivian's from Cambridge University. Wilkins argued in favour of replacing the royal prerogative with popular referendums, to solve constitutional issues like Irish Home Rule and the Disestablishment of the Church of England. In October 1890, the printers of The Whirlwind refused to complete one issue due to the inclusion of an inflammatory piece title \\"Young England\\". Erskine and Vivian promptly sued the printers for the loss of income from the cancelled edition. = End of the paper = The 8 November 1890 issue of The Whirlwind was the last to carry Erskine's name on the letterhead. Issues from 20 onwards appeared with his name crossed-out and were produced solely by Vivian. Erskine's absence from the paper was briefly note in that issue: \\"Our colleague has, for the nonce, been called from us. While duly deploring the discontinuance of his collaboration, we feel so deeply the importance of what is before him that we refrain from further regret and wish him Godspeed upon his delicate mission, in the full confidence that his brilliant success will shed additional lustre upon our own triumphs during his absence\\". The 26th. issue of the paper was published on 27 December 1890. It had fewer pages than most previous issues, and it led with a note from Vivian entitled \\"Not Dead but sleepy\\" which read, in part: \\"There will not be a Christmas number of The Whirlwind, but a large extra-special edition will be published on the birthday of the Proprietor-Editor, 3rd. April 1891. Until then The Whirlwind proposes to hibernate and, during the next three months, hushed in grim repose, will show no sign of life... The Proprietor-Editor finds that the direction of the Whirlwind absorbs his whole time... He intends devoting the next three months to political organization\\". Early in 1891, Vivian announced he was standing for election in the Bradford East constituency and Erskine that he was standing in Buteshire. In April 1891, despite their political ambitions, Erskine and Vivian were attempting to raise capital to restart the newspaper. Despite this, The Whirlwind did not resume publication. It's 26 issues had proved lively and eccentric indeed, filled with polemic, scurrilous personal attacks, political essays and drawings from some of the leading artists of the day.  Reception  The Whirlwind debuted to a wide range of critical reactions, many of which were published in subsequent issues of the paper. In July 1890, the Lady's Pictorial described The Whirlwind as \\"The oddest little journal I ever saw... The young men appear to be far from lacking in ideas\\", the Dramatic Review called it \\"A monument of youthful audacity...To give anything like a comprehensive description of this extraordinary publication, is impossible\\" and the Nottingham Daily Express wrote \\"I like bare unflushing cheeksometimes; and I am very much interested in the first number of The Whirlwind... for a more impudent little publication it would be difficult to turn out. It is frank, open egotism, though, and distinctly entertaining\\". The paper was criticised for its anti-semitic stance by Victor Yarros. In September 1890, The Star newspaper described it as \\"Rank Treason\\", and the Southampton Observer said it was \\"at once preposterously pretentious and absurdly paradoxical\\", while the Huddersfield Examiner reported: \\"For pertness and flippancy in full swing, you need to no more than invest a penny in a copy of The Whirlwind. It will not be particularly well spent, but you will have obtained an object\\".

Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote both the music and lyrics to the song. George Washington recounts to Hamilton the story of his first command, and his fears that history will judge him harshly for his actions.  Synopsis  The song begins after Hamilton has been promoted by George Washington to a command position in the Continental Army. Washington tells Hamilton the story of his first command, when his ineptitude led to a massacre among his men. Washington reveals his deep regret over the failure, his fear that history is judging his actions, and will hold him in contempt for his mistakes. Hamilton is told that, because of his increasing role in the events of the war, history will now be judging his actions in the same vein as Washington's.  Analysis  This song reveals Washington's inner struggle, and his conflict with the fact that he has no control over his legacy or how he is remembered. When Hamilton is told that history will be watching him, it symbolizes that Hamilton is becoming a significant part of the narrative of the war and of the early history of America. The melody for this song is repeated in the opening chords of the final song of Hamilton, \\"Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story\\".  Reception  A community poll on BuzzFeed ranked the song as 30th best in the musical. The Young Folks placed it as the 42nd best song. Clashcultures placed the song at 20th and claimed that it fills the listener with \\"hope and sadness\\".  History Has Its Eyes on You (mixtape)  A cover of the song was recorded for The Hamilton Mixtape. The song was sung by John Legend who also played the piano heard in the song. As the original casting call for Hamilton called for \\"a John Legend type\\" to play George Washington, Legend said he felt comfortable stepping into the role. The song has a different melody and chord progression than the original because Legend opted for a \\"more gospel\\" sound. The producer for The Roots, Ahmir Thompson, told Entertainment Weekly that he was \\"blown away\\" by the song and it was what made him realize that \\"this [the mixtape] could go anywhere\\" Slate ranked the song as the 10th best on the mixtape while Paste ranked it lower at the 21st best song.

His grandfather, Ghulam Mohammed Khan, had migrated to Faisalabad District in 1964 from Hyderabad Deccan and later moved to Lahore to work as a sarangi player at Radio Pakistan, Lahore, where he died in 1974. His grandson, Akhtar Hussain, later worked in Sindh province at Khairpur Radio Station as a contract musician for over 22 years playing background sarangi for many folk dramas on radio. He later decided to move to Karachi in 2006 to settle there. He was hired by National Academy of Performing Arts (NAPA) in Karachi, where he started earning a reasonable income by playing sarangi there. Music critics often argue that sarangi, out of all bowed string instruments, is the closest to the human voice. They say that when played by a true maestro, sarangi can express the sadness one experiences in love. In 2009, 50-year-old Akhtar Hussain was struggling through hard times and had taken shelter with his teenaged son in a small home at an imambargah in Karachi.

Route F12 was designed to operate between New Carrollton & Landover stations, via Ardwick Industrial Park on Weekdays only via Garden City Drive, Pennsy Drive, Ardwick-Ardmore Road, Jefferson Avenue, Polk Street, and Pennsy Drive. When operating to New Carrollton, it would make a right turn from the intersection of Ardwick-Ardmore Road onto the intersection of Pennsy Drive because Ardwick-Ardmore Road is only a one-way street between the intersections of Garden City Drive & Pennsy Drive and will operate along Corporate Drive and Garden City Drive to serve New Carrollton. Route F12 will also serve an extra loop serving Metro East Office Park after serving New Carrollton.

Gene Novello produced the record and co-wrote all of the songs. Fred Norman served as arranger and conductor. The title of the album is a play on Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman, the satirical television series popular at the time. Reception Upon its release, the album received mixed reviews. Billboard selected it as one of their \\"Recommended LPs for Jazz,\\" , and said, \\"Hartman swings into this album, then mellows into his usual clear, smooth vocal style.... Strong string and horn sections compliment this album.\\" The review listed \\"Starting Now,\\" \\"Suzanne,\\" \\"Onery Little Critter,\\" and \\"Hello Mrs. Jones\\" as \\"Best Cuts.\\" Music critic Robert Palmer, writing in Record World, said, \\"Johnny Hartman isn't as confused as Mary, but 'Johnny Hartman, Johnny Hartman' plays on the title of the popular television series nonetheless. This Musicor release ... doesn't really do Hartman justice, although he is in excellent voice.\\" Dave Nathan at AllMusic reviewed the 1996 reissue, entitled The Many Moods of Johnny Hartman, giving it two out of five stars and saying, \\"Hartman tries, but even his talent cannot save this material.... [He] is reduced to warbling (literally) a set of inane tunes composed by Gene Novello.... Not only are the songs mundane, but the arrangements are cloying and the performances, with the exception of Hartman's voice, uninspired and gimmicky.\\" Nathan does offer a positive comment: \\"The one track which is a cut above the others is a catchy 'I've Only Myself to Blame,' which features some very good alto by an unidentified player. It is the only one which Hartman seems to enjoy doing.\\" The review incorrectly states that the album had never been previously released after it was recorded in 1976. Reissues According to Gregg Akkerman, Hartman's biographer, the master tapes of Johnny Hartman, Johnny Hartman were sold after Musicor went out of business in 1978, and the album has been \\"repackaged and retitled for unsuspecting Hartman fans several times after his death.\\" Some reissues incorrectly claim that the material was previously unreleased. \\"It is rather implausible that all the parties concerned had no idea that the album had already been released in the late 70s.\\" Titles of the reissues include: The Many Moods of Johnny Hartman (1996), Johnny Hartman Sings the Songs of Paul Greenwood and Gene Novello (1997), and You Came a Long Way from St. Louis (2003).

It was designed by Charles Ponting and constructed in 1894‚Äì96. The church has been a Grade II listed building since 1985. History The Church of St Birinus was built as a chapel of ease to St Laurence in the parish of Downton. Prior to its construction, an earlier building doubling as a chapel of ease and infant school was erected in 1868‚Äì69 to serve the village. The infant school opened in January 1869 and the chapel opened for Divine service on 21 February 1869. The new church was built through the bequest of Rev. Edward Augustus Ferryman of Redlynch House, who died in 1884. He left ¬£2,000 towards the construction of a church and ¬£4,000 for its endowment, with the money to be made available on the death of his wife. Rev. Ferryman intended for the church to be built in memory of his uncle, Charles Theobold Maud who died in Bath in 1877. After Mrs. Ferryman died in December 1891, the new church scheme commenced. The chosen site for the church, next to the existing chapel/school, formed part of the land purchased in 1868. Plans for the church were drawn up by Charles Ponting of Marlborough and Charles Mitchell of Woodfalls was hired as the builder. The foundation stone was laid by Horatio Nelson, the 3rd Earl Nelson, on 27 September 1894, and the completed church was consecrated by the Bishop of Salisbury, the Right Rev. John Wordsworth, on 1 February 1896. It cost ¬£2,200 to build. The church used a harmonium until funds could be raised for an organ. It was made by Messrs. Conacher and Co of Huddersfield for ¬£185 and dedicated by the Bishop of Salisbury on 19 December 1900. The church had no pulpit until 1901, when an anonymous donor allowed the construction of one by Messrs. Jones and Willis of London. The oak pulpit was dedicated on 30 June 1901. Architecture The Church of St Birinus is built of local red brick, with a tiled roof, and dressings in Bath stone. Designed for 160 persons, it is made up of a nave, chancel, organ chamber and west baptistery, the latter having a north vestry and south porch. There is a west tower with a louvred bellcote containing one bell. A hipped gablet above one of the buttresses contains a statue of St Birinus, which was modelled in clay by Miss. A. M. Palmer. The five-light east window of the chancel contains three sections originally installed in the school chapel by Mrs. Ferryman in memory of her husband. The west end of the baptistery and the vestry have mullioned windows of oak. The floor of the nave, baptistery and vestry is paved with wood block, and the chancel and porch with tiles. The original font is of Bath stone and has an oak cover.

Artistic career He graduated in 1922 from the earliest training ground for modern Western art in China, the Shanghai Art School.. He became a professor at the Shanghai Art Academy upon his graduation. He continued his studies in Western art and art history in Tokyo at the Kubwata Painting school under Fujishima Takeji. In 1927 Ni returned to China to protest the Japanese military incursion into Shandong. There, he taught at Gangzhou Municipal Art School, then at the Wuchang Art Academy in Hubei. By 1930, he was an art critic, theorist, and creative writer, as well as an oil painter. In 1931 Ni, Pang Xunqin (1906-1985), and five other modernist painters formed the Storm society to promote modern Western art's influence on Chinese art. Ni Yide helped write the group‚Äôs manifesto. The Storm Society wanted to be unrestrained by past conventions in art such as limitations by nature. They said that art is not a slave of religion or literature. The storm society exhibited works inspired by European styles such as Fauvism, Cubism, symbolism, expressionism, futurism, abstractionism and surrealism. Their works were featured in Shanghai newspapers and magazines such as Liangyou, Meishije and Shidai. Ni was also a member of the Muse society at the Shanghai Art Academy. They published l'Art Journal, which provided a venue for its manifesto and most of its exhibition news. One of his paintings, ‚Äò'Summer‚Äô' (1932) was cubist-inspired.. In 1941, Ni set up Nitian Studio in Chongqing. On December 8 1942, the day after the Pearl Harbor attacks, Japanese encroachment caused the 10 members of the Storm Society to flee south. In 1944 he became a professor at NAA in Chongqing. In 1945 Ni Yide, Din Yangyong (1902-1978), and a few other artists exhibited their works at the Chinese Modern painting exhibition (Zhongguo Xiandai huihan zhan) organized by Zao Wouki (1921-2013) in Chongqing. After World War II, Yide became part of the nine person art society in Shanghai.. In 1949, Ni became a professor and vice president of ZAFA (Zhejang Academy of Fine Arts). In 1953, Ni transferred to teach at CAFA (Central Academy of Fine Arts) China. In 1955, Ni became a director of the editing department of Meishu. In 1961 Ni set up a studio in ZAFA, Hangzhou. Writing career As a writer, Ni Yide used his considerable literary skills to defend stylistic innovation and personal creativity as the essentials for a modern art in modern China. In the 2nd national art exhibition of China, Ni Yide criticized the judges for their conservative bias, and dismissed \\"official art\\" with the argument that in France real progress always came outside of the government salon. Ni Yide wrote an article defending Qui Ti (1906-1958), a Storm society member who received criticism from realists for a still life of flowers she painted. He wrote an article on Pan Tianshou‚Äôs (1897-1971) bird and flower landscapes where he described ‚ÄòBathed in Dew‚Äô as poetical and ‚ÄòAfter the Rain‚Äô where he mentions for example, ‚Äú...the crimson flowers with their stately leaves appear pure and noble, lovely and gentle and above all lyrical in their beauty‚Äù. He uses strong imagery. According to Yide ‚Äú ‚Ä¶If we want to exhibit our national heritage, I believe, landscape painting is the most suitable subject.

The basic principles and directions of the migration policy of the European Union  In order to regulate and control the high number of migrants as a result of the migration crisis in 2015, the EU annually directs its efforts to develop an effective European migration policy.. The creation of a migration policy and its functioning is based on the collection of data about the current state of affairs, in particular the statistics of the number of legal and illegal migrants who have crossed the borders of the European Union. Despite the fact that migration policy is internally determined, it also serves as an international regulator because it is related to crossing state borders. Accordingly, events at the international level directly affect the development of this type of policy. Based on the data published by UNHCR, as a result of hostilities in Syria, almost 22% of the country's population (with estimated of 4 million people) turned out to be refugees and internally displaced persons by the beginning of 2015. At the same time as a results of new EU policies, in 2017 the number of migrants has decreased ‚Äì during the first quarter of 2017, number of immigrants and refugees accounted for 35% of their numbers of the first quarter of 2016. = Main principles and activities of migration policy =  Changes of 2015  In 2015, the European Commission proposed a system of measures to improve the migration policy of the European Union. A decision was made to strengthen the EU's presence in the world. This decision was reinforced by the Action Plan to Combat Smuggling of Migrants for 2015‚Äì2020: it strengthen the stimulation of law enforcement and judicial activities, improved the collection and exchange of information on migrants, and forfeited cooperation with non-EU countries to combat illegal migration. One of the main principles of migration policy is the principle of solidarity, which is expressed in respect for natural human rights, in the coordination of political and social forces in solving the migration issue. Starting from 2015, many Central European countries unilaterally were closing their borders imprisoning people on the EU countries borders for additional investigations on their further moving intentions , thereby damaging the solidarity of the Schengen countries and violating the Dublin Regulation, which determines the procedure for considering applications for international protection . EU enacted to block the migration route through the Western Balkans and let in Europe only those migrants and refugees, who will get there by legal routes originating in Turkey. Thus, it was assumed that: the participating countries will forever stop the passage of migrants and refugees through their territory; strict entry control will be introduced at the external borders of the EU; Greece will receive substantial financial assistance due to acceptance of a strong migration flow, as well as an agreement will be reached with Ankara that Turkey will not allow illegal migrants across its border to Europe and will receive back migrants not allowed into the EU.  Eurozone refugee resettlement  In addition, on September 22, 2015, member states of the European Union decided to grant national quotas to refugees in Europe. This principle was developed with the aim of reducing migration pressure in countries such as Italy and Greece. The resettlement of refugees in the eurozone took into account such economic and demographic indicators as GDP, population, unemployment rate and the number of already considered asylum applications in countries that are members of the European Union. The European Union has a broad regulatory framework through which it distributes refugees in Europe. Currently, Dublin III regulations are being implemented revised and amended by European Union member countries in 2016. According to the Regulation, migrants are not able to choose the state from which they decided to apply for asylum. The regulation allows to apply for refugee status only from the country in which migrants enter first. At the same time, if there is a desire to change the country, migrants will have to return to their original point of arrival. In addition to the Dublin Agreement, the EU complies with the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, which is the main legislative act establishing the status and rights of refugees. According to the key provisions of the legal act, the main apparatus in the regulation of situations with refugees is the government. They are obliged to preserve the rights and freedoms of internally displaced persons and refugees, but at the same time monitor the creation of such a legal provision that is used by all foreigners who have arrived in a foreign country on a common basis  Key solutions to the migration crisis  Decisions on the migration crisis are formulated in the final documents of the European Council, adopted on February 18, March 7 and 18, 2016, which can be grouped in three major areas: Firstly, the EU has provided financial and expert support, to countries that have accepted the main migration flow, in particular Greece, which will facilitate the provision of humanitarian assistance to refugees, the observance of administrative procedures for border control and the processing of asylum requests in accordance with the rules EU. Reception centers are being set up, where newly arrived migrants will pass a quick check and will be divided into those whose asylum requests can be considered, and those for whom the further path is closed. In addition, transit centers are organized to which candidates for asylum or other forms of international protection will be sent. Secondly, the EU has concluded an agreement with Turkey, which clearly defines the rights and obligations of both parties in connection with the influx of refugees and migrants traveling through Turkey to Europe. According to this agreement, migrants who illegally arrived in Greece from Turkey will be sent back to Turkey, and Europe will accept migrants only on condition that their asylum requests are submitted and approved in Turkish territory. Also, the Turkish authorities from now are obliged to block the channels of smuggling and illegal transportation of people to Europe. Meanwhile the EU gave the right to legal employment and education of Syrian children in Turkish schools. In exchange, European leaders agreed to pay compensation of ‚Ç¨ 3 billion to Turkey in 2016-2017, expedite the abolition of visas for Turkish citizens entering the Schengen zone, and resume the stalled negotiations on Turkey‚Äôs accession to the EU Thirdly, in accordance with the obligation taken by all EU countries to return to compliance with the Schengen rules and establish strict border controls, additional resources were allocated to specialized services, including the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) and the European Asylum Support Service for persons applying for obtaining asylum (EASO). Based on statistics published by UNHCR, these EU decisions have significantly affected the number of people crossing the Greek border - the number of migrants has more than halved. However, according to critics, the decline in migration occurred due to the fact that people in anticipation of a new EU-Turkey agreement, massively emigrated to Greece before its adoption in order to avoid migration problems after the agreement formal entry into force. Therefore, new agreement has no influence on the declining number of migrants.  Main issues of EU migration policy  In 2017, the EU migration policy was tightened. At the summit held in Brussels on October 19, 2017, it was indicated that the approach of the EU Member States and institutions to ensure full control over the borders should be consolidated. Moreover, the conclusions of the European Council indicate its readiness to respond and suppress any attempts to illegally cross the borders of EU Member States. However, the settlement of the issue did not become clearer due to presence of EU‚Äôs ‚Äúvicious circle‚Äù problem, which consists in confronting immigrant flows and at the same time in complying with the principles protecting the human rights of migrants, combating poverty, etc. Representatives of the European Commission and countries which support the adoption of migrants emphasize the need to fulfill international obligations, focusing on the priority of migrant security. Meanwhile, opponents of the reception of migrants emphasize that the highest value is the security of the state and its citizens highlighting that migration could be an economic, cultural and religious risk. As a result of this, phobia of Islamization based on the socio-political as well as cultural dominance of Islam in the EU countries emerges. Unshakable human rights enter into confrontation with the slogans on the expulsion of migrants, the course to which the EU has proclaimed. The position of national states in relation to migrants who violate public order and impose their own way of life is becoming tougher, which unconditionally leads to a restriction of the rights of migrants, and soon and a possible subsequent restriction of the rights of indigenous people. = Inconsistency of actions of member countries of the European Union = The principle of resettlement of refugees by quotas has not proved its worth in all countries of the European Union. According to statistics for 2017, Malta and Luxembourg accepted the maximum number of migrants among all EU countries with an average of 41-46 immigrants per 1000 population. Meanwhile, Czechia, Croatia, Bulgaria and Slovakia accepted less than 5 migrants per 1000 of population. In the fall of 2015, the Czech Republic, together with Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, voted against the compulsory admission of refugees. Later, under pressure from EU neighbors, authorities nevertheless agreed to comply with EU requirements. Czech Republic supposed to accept 2000 asylum seekers but only 12 people were accepted for quotas in the Czech Republic. Spokesperson of the president of Czech Republic Milos Zeman commented that : ‚ÄúOur country simply cannot afford to risk terrorist attacks like those that occurred in France and Germany. By accepting migrants, we would create fertile ground for barbaric attacks‚Äù  See also  * Illegal immigration * Immigration to Greece * List of sovereign states and dependent territories by immigrant population * European migrant crisis * Free movement protocol  References  = Citations = Category:Immigration Category:European Union Category:Human migration ","title":"Migration policy of the European Union"},{"id":"62251259","text":"Ranjeet Singh may refer to: *Ranjeet Singh (Pakistani politician) *Ranjeet Singh (Indian politician) ","title":"Ranjeet Singh"},{"id":"62251272","text":"Archie White (born 5 August 1997) is an English professional rugby union player who plays as a flanker for Premiership Rugby club Harlequins.

It is situated northwest of Squamish, and southeast of Mount Tantalus, which is the highest peak in the Tantalus Range. Its nearest higher peak is Lydia Mountain, to the west- northwest, and Omega Mountain lies to the east. Lake Lovely Water lies below the northern slope of the peak and precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Squamish River. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1910 by E. Kingsford-Smith and G. Warren via the south side. The mountain's name was officially adopted on June 6, 1957, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The mountain was named for Niobe, daughter of Tantalus in Greek mythology, with several peaks in the Tantalus Range being named for family members of Tantalus. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Niobe is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. This climate supports small glacier remnants on the east and north slopes of Niobe. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Niobe.

Active since the year 2011, the ensemble has released three full-length albums since, and is led by Arian Bagheri Pour Fallah and Ashkan Zareie.  Beginnings, The Irrationalist and Mystery Manta  After original establishment in 2011 by ethnographer-composer Arian Bagheri Pour Fallah, the ensemble debuted in the year 2013 with multi-instrumentalist Ashkan Zareie as the second director the record The Irrationalist, viewed by Rest Art as \\"dissociative in nature,\\" comparable in its free improvisation roots to the works of Tim Hodgkinson's Konk Pack and aligned structurally along the atonal trajectory of the likes of \\"Stockhausen.\\" The Irrationalist was soon followed by a second album in the year 2014. In his review of the ensemble's 2014 follow-up, Mystery Manta, for Sputnikmusic, staff critic Tristan Jones described the album as \\"an impressive feat in sonically diverse improvisation, with odes to exploration and no safety lines.\\" He noted that despite lack of a \\"conventional structure\\" as with \\"Faust-esque krautrock\\" and \\"expressionist\\" music, The Blunder Of A Horse followed \\"terrifying\\" narratives \\"heightened by the element of surprise, mixing sparse time signatures with drastic changes in sound,\\" characteristics unique to film and incidental music. Mystery Manta was \\"recommended\\" by Avant Music News, and included in the best albums of 2014 by Noise/Admiration and Holy Grail from Hell respectively.  Zoantrophi, Methodology and Mythology  In 2015, The Blunder Of A Horse released a third album, Zoantrophi. The Modern Folk Music of America \\"highly recommended\\" the record as \\"an exploration of world folk through a psychedelic lens\\" while We Need No Swords concluded \\"Zoantrophi channels that particular strain of psychedelia that Jhonn Balance and Sleazy Christopherson made their own, but twisting their mordant lyricism into the more abstract, sinewy forms familiar to anyone versed in the Emanem or Incus discographies.\\" Emphasis was put on both methodology and mythology of the ensemble in reviews of the album, whereby entheoges, \\"Appalachia\\" and several Austronesian, Celtic and Welsh sources were recognized and elaborated on. The greater part of these remain reputed when viewed with the largely humanities-centered liner notes in mind. The liner notes of the album, having in the past included excerpts from Blanchot and Bataille, quote a passage from A Thousand Plateaus, in Zoantrophi. Furthermore, the composition Richeleneblom was dedicated to French erotic artist and etcher Henri Richelet and painter Rickard Eneblom.  Instrumentation  The Blunder Of A Horse is known for wide-ranging, maximal instrumentation comprising a range of aerophones and prepared string instruments.  Origin  The origins of the ensemble remain disputed to date, with Expos√© Online and The Modern Folk Music of America listing \\"United States\\" and Sputnikmusic, \\"the Republic of Palau,\\" as place of origin.

In Saudi Arabia children are pushed into cheap labor, sex exploitation, and are also used in local militias. The majority of child labor in Saudi Arabia is concentrated in the areas of human trafficking, agriculture, and family businesses. The Saudi Vision 2030 can potentially reducing child labor in Saudi Arabia.  Definitions  = Child Labor = Child labor, as defined by the International Labour Organization (ILO), is work that deprives children of their childhood, dignity, potential, and that is harmful to a child‚Äôs physical and mental development. International efforts to abolish child labor were first organized at the International Labour Conference in Berlin in 1890. Child labor is far more prevalent in developing countries, including much of the middle east, where millions of children are working in mines, fields, and service industries. Child labor has existed throughout history and reached its peak in western society during the 19th and 20th centuries following the onset of the industrial revolution. In poor countries, one in four children are working in a form of child labor. Primary causes of child labor are poverty and lack of access to education. Oftentimes, income the child makes from their work is thought of as crucial for their survival and the survival of their family. = Consequences of Child Labor = Consequences of child labor include interfering with a child‚Äôs schooling by depriving them the ability to attend school as a result of working. A child may be obliged to leave school before completion or demanding the child to attend school along with long and demanding work. According to a study conducted by ILO, sending a child into child labor rather than to school can bring large economic downfalls for developing nations. Employed children are less likely to attend school and results in a less educated, and less economically competitive population in the future. = Saudi Vision 2030 = Saudi Vision 2030 was announced by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the 30-year-old son of King Salman. The plan‚Äôs aim is to reduce Saudi Arabia‚Äôs reliance on hydrocarbons, by increasing pride in national identity and cultural heritage, promoting physical and social well-being, to improve the quality of life and improve health and education. These improvements can lead to making more opportunities available for the children and parents of poor economic background, potentially reducing child labor in Saudi Arabia.  Current state of child labor in Saudi Arabia  Saudi Arabia Census 2011 shows children and young adults make up half of the 28 million population in Saudi Arabia. Of this population, 15 percent are child laborers. 42 percent of the children spend four to eight hours a day outside the home, 40 percent spend eight to 12 hours, while 10 percent spend more than 12 hours outside the home. The majority of child labor in Saudi Arabia is concentrated in the areas of human trafficking, agriculture, and family businesses. The Government of Yemen has signed trafficking agreements with neighboring countries, provided training to security and border officials on how to recognize and care for trafficked children, raised awareness among parents about the dangers of child trafficking, and established a reception and rehabilitation centre on the border with Saudi Arabia for returned child victims. According to a 2018 Report on Saudi Arabia human rights conducted by the US Government, the law prohibits inhumane forms of child labor. It states that no person younger than 15 is permitted to work unless that person is the sole source of support for the family. If a child is between the ages of 13 and 15, they are permitted to work as long as it does not interfere with their schoolwork. Children under the age of 18 are not allowed to work shifts longer than 6 hours a day. Additionally, minors are under no circumstances are to be employed in environments deemed hazardous or harmful. There is no minimum age for workers employed in family-owned businesses. These businesses and household jobs include farming, herding, and domestic service.https://www.state.gov/wp- content/uploads/2019/03/SAUDI-ARABIA-2018.pdf  Industries  = Child Trafficking = One of the foremost forms of child labor in Saudi Arabia. Globally in 2006, it was estimated 1.2 million children were subjected to trafficking annually. Children in the Saudi Arabia region are trafficked for multiple reasons, including cheap labor, sex exploitation, and for use in local militias. Trafficking expands to war efforts as well. Human rights monitoring organization SAM reported Saudi Arabia has been enlisting Yemeni children using human trafficking to fight alongside Saudi Arabia against Yemen. = Agriculture = Has the highest percentage of all child labor, 62%. The predominant drivers for child labor in agriculture include lack of access to education and poverty. To be considered child labor, the work done in the agriculture industry must be hazardous or interfere with schooling. Most children are involved in agriculture working in their own family‚Äôs farm. These households are oftentimes poorer, an indication the children will be involved in a form of child labor.https://glm-lic.iza.org/wp- content/uploads/2017/06/glmlic_sp003.pdf  References  Category:Child labour ","title":"Child labor in Saudi Arabia"},{"id":"62251384","text":"Magnus Enfeldt (born 25 August 1969) is a Swedish speed skater.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. The building has been converted to residential use, known as Ivory Key Apartments. Description and history The former Jewett Piano Company Building is located on the south side of Adams Street, extending west from its junction with Cotton Street. It is a four story timber-framed structure, five bays wide and 32 long, with a flat roof topped by a cupola roughly near the middle. The piano case manufacturing industry was one of Leominster's major businesses in the 19th century, contributing significantly to the city's economic growth until a precipitous decline in the years following World War I. Wade Hampton Jewett (1819-1894), a native of Amesbury, Massachusetts, came to Leominster and in 1840 began manufacturing furniture. He opened the first in a series of piano case manufacturing partnerships in 1856, and incorporated W.H. Jewett in 1885. That business built this plant in 1892, and operated there until closing in 1931. It was then taken over by New England Novelties, which operated here and in a nearby building on Adams Street. By 1983 the building had stood vacant for some years.

Reigning during a period of political uncertainty, Ratan Singh proved himself to be an ineffective monarch. He faced multiple rebellions among his relatives during his short reign as well as incursions by the Sur Empire. He was assassinated and supplanted by his brother after ten years of rule. Life Ratan Singh was the eldest son of Bhim Singh, Raja of Amber. His paternal grandparents were Raja Prithviraj Singh I and his wife Bala Bai, a daughter of Rao Lunkaran of Bikaner. He ascended the throne upon the premature death of his father in July 1537. However, he showed himself to be an ineffective monarch, being viewed as weak and suffering from alcohol addiction. This resulted in a breakdown of order in the kingdom. Raimal, a relative from a cadet branch of the Kachwahas, took advantage of this turbulence and ceded territory from the crown for himself. Ratan Singh's paternal uncles, Sanga and Bharmal, also turned against him and attempted to launch a conspiracy, though this proved less successful. In 1544, the Sur emperor Sher Shah Suri launched an attack against the kingdom. Already the ruler of much of Rajputana, Suri was a formidable threat who had already forced the submission of the likes of Maharana Udai Singh II of Mewar. Perhaps taking cue from the latter, Ratan Singh likewise surrendered and accepted the suzerainty of the Afghan ruler. By the end of his reign, Ratan Singh had earned the enmity of many through his use of insults. These individuals instigated his younger brother, Askaran, to make a bid for the crown and on 15 May 1548, Ratan Singh was poisoned to death. Askaran ascended the throne, though was himself overthrown after a reign of only 16 days and was in turn succeeded by their uncle Bharmal.

The phrase first drew widespread attention due to a November 2019 TikTok video in response to an older man, though the phrase was actually coined years before that. Considered by some to be ageist, the phrase has also been used commercially to sell merchandise, and there have been multiple trademark applications submitted for the phrase.  Origin  \\"OK boomer\\" was popularized as a reaction to a video on TikTok of an unidentified older man, in which he declared that \\"millennials and Generation Z have the Peter Pan syndrome [...] they don't ever want to grow up [and] they think that the utopian ideals that they have in their youth are somehow going to translate into adulthood\\". The video inspired the phrase \\"OK boomer\\" as a dismissal of the ideals of past generations. The first recorded instance of the phrase \\"OK boomer\\" appeared in a Reddit comment on 29 January 2009, a decade before it became popular. The term's more recent usage can be traced back to 2015 on 4chan, but it started to become popular in January 2019. The term gained media popularity in early November 2019 when articles about the phrase were published.  Usage  The phrase has been used as a retort for perceived resistance to technological change, climate change denial, marginalization of members of minority groups, or opposition to younger generations' ideals. Various media publications have noted the meme's usage on social media platforms beyond TikTok, and The New York Times wrote that \\"teenagers use it to reply to cringey YouTube videos, Donald Trump tweets, and basically any person over 30 who says something condescending about young peopleand the issues that matter to them\\". , videos tagged with #OkBoomer on TikTok had been viewed nearly 2 billion times. Chl√∂e Swarbrick, who reacted to a heckle from Todd Muller with \\"OK boomer\\" In early November 2019, while giving a speech supporting a climate change bill, New Zealand MP Chl√∂e Swarbrick claimed that the average age of parliamentarians was 49 years old, and Gen X MP Todd Muller interrupted her, to which she promptly responded with \\"OK boomer\\". She wrote in an article in The Guardian that her comment \\"symbolised exhaustion of multiple generations\\". Swarbrick was criticized on social media for promoting ageism, including by the MP Christopher Bishop, though she received much support otherwise. \\"OK boomer\\" is a song written and produced by 20-year-old college student Johnathan Williams, which was shared on Twitter in July 2019. It features cutting lyrics and Williams shouting \\"OK boomer\\" repeatedly in response. 19-year-old Peter Kuli then published a remix of the song on SoundCloud that circulated on TikTok, fueling the meme even further and leading to serve as a kind of anthem. During halftime of the Harvard-Yale football game on 23 November 2019, climate change protesters interrupted the game by rushing the field and remained even after they were asked to leave, instead chanting \\"OK boomer\\". On 9 January 2020, during the Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time tournament, \\"OK boomer\\" was the answer to a 400 point question in the \\"OK\\" category: \\"A 2019 New York Times article says this 2-word phrase 'marks the end of friendly generational relations'.\\" Ken Jennings elicited laughter from the audience with the response, \\"I get to say it to Alex! What is 'OK, boomer'?\\" The phrase was used by Chief Justice John Roberts of the Supreme Court of the United States on 15 January 2020, as part of questioning for an age discrimination case. On 2 March 2020, streamer Neekolul posted a video on TikTok which showed her lip-syncing and dancing to the Senzawa song \\"Oki Doki Boomer\\" while wearing a Bernie 2020 shirt. The video received over 6 million views in four days before being removed due to a copyright claim, although the Senzawa stated that he was not responsible for the copyright strike. On Twitter, the video received over 30 million views. The video was met with mixed reactions, with users divided over whether the video was cute or cringeworthy. Commercialization A hoodie designed by a U.S. art student bearing the phrase, followed by \\"have a terrible day\\", generated more than $25,000 in sales by 1 November 2019. Multiple trademark applications have been filed for the phrase, including one from Fox Media with the intent to launch \\"an ongoing television series featuring reality competition, comedy, and game shows\\". Reception Some commentators have considered the phrase to be ageist. The conservative radio host Bob Lonsberry went as far as labeling the word \\"boomer\\" as \\"the N-word of ageism\\" in a controversial tweet that was deleted soon after it was posted. Furthermore, Lonsberry stated that \\"being hip and flip does not make bigotry OK, nor is a derisive epithet acceptable because it is new\\". The Late Show with Stephen Colbert mocked him: \\"Clearly this fella needs to play the hot new game: 'Is This The New N-Word?' No, it's not. Thank you for playing.\\" Francine Prose of The Guardian suggested that the phrase reflects general cultural acceptance of discrimination against older generations. Also writing for The Guardian Bhaskar Sunkara criticized the meme and said that baby boomers instead \\"need solidarity\\" because many \\"older workers and retirees are struggling to survive\\" as \\"half of Americans approaching age 65 have less than $25,000 in savings\\". In an interview, AARP executive Myrna Blyth told Axios, \\"OK, millennials. But we're the people that actually have the money.\\" Several French politicians have also accused the phrase of being ageist, with MP Audrey Dufeu Schubert (La R√©publique en Marche!) deeming it an ageist slur in a special report on \\"succeeding in bridging the generational gap and fighting ageism\\". Other reactions have been more mixed or even positive. The phrase, according to India Ross of the Financial Times, has \\"come to symbolise a generational cultural fracture\\" with attacks on its use from baby boomers perhaps only serving to increase its power and use. Cl√©mence Michallon of The Independent applauded the phrase as \\"just the right amount of dismissive\\" while also warning against its overuse. Miyo McGinn of Grist applauded the term, writing, \\"This joy undeniably stems from righteous indignation as much as simple amusement ‚Äî the two words feel downright poetic after years of hearing my generation blamed for 'killing' everything from restaurant chains to department stores to relationships.\\" Some have commented that the term should be considered a shorthand term for \\"The Establishment\\" rather than targeting a specific age group. \\"OK boomer\\" was named the \\"Word of the Year 2019\\" by a blog in New Zealand and in the Netherlands by the dictionary Van Dale. It was nominated for a similar designation by a university in Switzerland, landing in second place. The phrase was also featured on Lake Superior State University's annual Banished Words List.

In 1961 the book was published by Rab√©n & Sj√∂gren in Sweden.  Plot  Mokihana lives in Hawaii where she has many friends. Originally the children's families came to Hawaii from different countries and cultures, but they all speak English. The friends meet each other almost every day and have many adventures. They are organising a secret birthday party for Anela, who turns ten. Mokihana and her friends are preparing flower wreaths for the party and Mokihana draws a picture of Anela's favourite dog Iki. Anela is surprised because she thought that everyone had forgotten her birthday. Together the friends celebrate her birthday, eat mangos, pineapple, banana, papayas, ice cream, cakes and drink orange juice. In addition, Anela gets chicks in a basket as a birthday present. She is overjoyed!  Overview  The book Mokihana is part of the Children's Everywhere series by Anna Riwkin-Brick. It was made in Hawaii. Anna Riwkin-Brick and her sister Eug√©nie S√∂derberg lived there for several months. While Riwkin took the photos, S√∂derberg was responsible for the text. For a picture that appeared in the book, more than a hundred photos were taken.Dvorit Shargal (2017): Where is Lilibet the Circus child and what happened in Honolulu? DVD  Documentary film from Israel  Especially in Israel, the Children's Everywhere series were a great success, which was also based on the translations by the poet Leah Goldberg. In 2017, Israeli director Dvorit Shargal shot a 50-minute documentary entitled Where is Lilibet the Circus child and what happened in Honolulu?. In the film, director Shargal tried to find out what happened to Mokihana after the end of the book.  Reception  At the time of publication, the book was considered as a school book for educational purposes. It showed how children, whose families were originally from different cultures, play with each other very happily without any prejudices.Books for Schools and the Treatment of Minorities: Hearings, Eighty-ninth Congress, Second Session, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1966, S.315 Rose C. Merenda wrote in the book Day Care and Early Education (1987) that Mokihana Lives in Hawaii is a great story to teach and educate children in schools on Hawaiian life. It is especially important because the students can compare Mokihana's life to their own life.

Her work has contributed greatly to the register of surviving buildings in Central Asia and in many cases was the first register of traditional surviving buildings. G. A. Pugachenkova directed a branch of the archaeological expedition of southern Turkmenistan from 1946 to 1961, and of the Uzbek historical-artistic expedition from 1959 to 1984. Given the large number of publications of scientific importance, G. A. Pugachenkova is still considered the world leader of women researchers of all time. Education and career Pugachenkova was an outstanding academic and scholar, publishing over 700 works in six languages, on the fine and applied art of antique and medieval central Asia. Her career began in 1937 when she graduated from the Central Asian Industrial Institute. This led to a long career studying the development of ancient Asia, including monuments such as exploring places such as Holchayon, Dalvarzintepa and Bactria. Pugachenkova began writing her first scientific works in 1958, characterised by her interest in the evolution of Central Asian architecture in the history of architecture, with a particular focus on 14th and 15th century. The study of the architectural material collected during the excavation campaigns of Khalchayan and Dalverzintepa allowed Galina Anatolevna to develop theories on the genetic origins of Kushan art and the various influences of Bactrian and Parthian culture on the artistic culture of Gandhara. She developed a great interest in numismatics, which allowed her to refine her study of the different ancestral sculptural styles and her lively interest in the coroplastics of Margiana and Northern Bactria, led her to study the bas-reliefs of Samarkand as a relative material for details and small architectural patterns. G.A. Pugachenkova has left a number of monographs on the concept of the evolution of Central Asian art, including \\"The Art of Uzbekistan from the Most Ancient Times to the middle of the 19th Century\\", awarded by the Khamza Uzbek SSR State Prize. (co-author with L.I. Rempel), \\"The Art of Turkmenistan\\", \\"The Art of Afghanistan\\", \\"The Art of Bactria of the Kushan era\\", \\"From the artistic treasure of the Middle East\\". Pugachenkova held the following positions over the course of her career: *Associate Professor of Archaeology Department of History Faculty, Central Asian University (Tashkent State University) (1942‚Äì60), then Professor (1962) *Head of the Department of History of Art and Architecture (1960‚Äì84) *Head of Scientific Expedition and Head of Art History of Uzbekistan (1959‚Äì84) *Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan Academician-Secretary of the Department of History, Linguistics and Literary Studies (1984‚Äì87) *Academic Advisor at the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan (1987) She was critical of the dispersal of Uzbek treasures into foreign museums and called in the 1970s for their repatriation. This has begun with extensive publications of catalogues to draw the material together. Galina Pugachenkova was married to Mikhail Masson, who was also a well-known central Asian archaeologist. After her death, mourners were able to see her a final time in her coffin in the Central Exhibition Hall of the Uzbek Academy of Arts. She was buried on 19 February 2007, following Christian rites.  Art history  As an art historian she wrote on a wide variety of central Asian art-forms, including miniature painting. On miniature painting, she said that when artists illustrated literature in the form, they showed \\"their time and their place\\" not that of the literary work. Pugachenkova came up with original interpretations of art historical questions, including a study of the dragon totem seen on the Sheikh Jemaliddin Mosque in Turkmenistan. She also studied illuminated manuscripts in Uzbekistan. Archaeology Galina Anatolevna had her first contact with the world of archaeology thanks to her participation in the YuTAKE (Southern Turkmen Archaeological Complex Expedition) project from 1936 to 1938, led by M. E. Masson, who later became her husband. The project, which for the first time brought a systematic approach to archaeology in Central Asia, developed in Pugachenkova the awareness that the architectural artifacts kept in museums are not sufficient to reconstruct the development of Middle Eastern architecture and art, but it is essential to seek history in the artifacts preserved in situ and under the ground. The experience at YuTAKE, the following years spent in Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and Iran, and the collaboration with Masson, resulted in Galina Anatolevna applying archaeological methods in the research and study of architectural monuments leading to the creation of unique expeditions to explore the historical-artistic heritage of Uzbekistan. Her work has opened the doors of the Central Asian and Afghan art to the world's scientific community and to the entire world. As an archaeologist, Pugachenkova excavated widely and published both on art and architecture, including Buddhist architecture in the fourth-century. She also worked extensively on Sogdian archaeology with Vladimir Karasev. She studied the archaeology of the Silk Road through Turkmenistan as part of a team from the Academy of Science. She was the first person to study in detail the eleventh century ruins of Akcha- kala. Another research project led her to research the fifteenth century Timurid gardens, proposing they followed established plans and held many symbolic meanings in their layout. Materials, such as gold were central to her research, as she studied the wealth from a wide variety of sites. She also had a keen research interest in burial practices from Sogdia. =Field research= * Early 1980s: Pugachenkova led the Uzbek Art-Historical Expedition to carry out excavations at the burial-ground of Orlat, 50 km north-west of Samarkand. * 1974‚Äì6: she led the excavation of the site Jiga Tepe, which dated from the Hellenistic to the Sassanian eras. * 1973: she led excavations in Afghanistan exploring the Kushan military camp at Zadiyan. * 1972: she led the excavations at Dalverzin Tepe, uncovering extraordinary elephant figurines from India. * 1967‚Äì9: she led the surveys of Islamic monuments around Herat, this led to extensive excavation. * 1960: architectural investigation of the mausoleum at Arab Ata. * 1959‚Äì63: she led the excavations at Khalchayan. * 1947: excavation and recording of the Seyit Jamal-ad-Din Mosque.

She founded the Atomi School in 1875 in Kanda, Tokyo, one of the oldest women's universities in Japan. Atomi Kakei was born in Osaka into the rural elite. Both of her parents were well-educated, and they both taught at her father's juku. As the daughter of a scholar of Chinese learning, she had the opportunity to be educated in the Chinese Classics, a field that was traditionally male dominated. She studied calligraphy under Setsuan Miyahara, a student of Sanyo Rai. She studied painting under painters Oryu Maruyama, Raisho Nakajima, and Hine Taizan. She is known for her decorative work inside the Sakura, Chiba mansion of Hotta Masatomo. In 1857, she moved to Kyoto to study. She returned to her family several years later to help her father run his juku. There, she taught painting, calligraphy, and poetry. By 1870, she had run a juku in Osaka for six years and in Kyoto for five. However, her primary interest was in art rather than education. That same year, she moved to Tokyo, where she later founded the Atomi School. In Tokyo, the social conditions of women in the city inspired her to reform girls' education. She opened another juku, which eventually grew to become the Atomi School. The Atomi School taught girls practical subjects in addition to Chinese and Japanese Classics. Atomi Kakei served as the head of the school until 1919, when she was replaced by her adopted daughter. She remained active with the school and the cause of women's education until her death in 1926.  Educational Philosophy  Atomi Kakei believed that the woman's primary role was within the family. As such, the Atomi School was founded with the goal of preparing girls to be wives and mothers. While she encouraged women to obey their husbands, she said to not do so blindly, knowing why. Atomi stressed the importance of women's contributions to the nation's stability and economic success: She encouraged women to supplement their husband's income by engaging in some form of art or craft. She also advised against spending money unnecessarily on luxuries, and encouraged frugality. Atomi rejected what she referred to as the 'new woman,' those who were challenging the traditional social order, such as women who chose to stay unmarried. Atomi Kakei believed that real social change had to come from within, and encouraged women to first work on themselves.

It is economically one of the largest centers for banking, pharmaceutical, chemical, and biotech industries in Europe. Lyon's strong economical presence is nothing new, as it has been at the forefront of Europe's economic industries dating back to the Roman Empire. The industrialization of Lyon came about in 4 different phases, first with the French Renaissance period of the 15th century, then the silk industries in the 18th and 19th centuries, followed by World War I, and more recently with the advanced technologies of the 20th and 21st centuries. Beginning of Lyon's economy Situated on the Rh√¥ne River and in the Rh√¥ne river valley, Lyon has played a crucial role in uniting the coasts of France with its interior. The Romans were the first to recognize this around 120 BC, later founding the Gallia Viennensis colony in 51 BC. The ideal location of the city saw it to be the center of trade for many industries in western Europe. =Lugdunum= The economic development of the city of Lyon began early in the Roman Empire, when Lyon was known as Lugdunum. In 27 BC, Lugdunum became the headquarters of the Roman empire for the 3 provinces of Gaul. It thus became the administrative, cultural, and commercial center of the Gauls in the Roman Empire. A network of Roman roads known as the Via Agrippa helped connect the Atlantic ocean, the English channel, the North-East coast of Gaul, and Gaul's South-East to Lugdunum, increasing trade and influence in the city. France's major roadways today still follow the same patterns as the Via Agrippa roadways. Along with its strategic location between the Sa√¥ne and Rh√¥ne rivers, Lugdunum quickly rose as an important center for commerce in the Roman empire. =Silk trade of 15th‚Äì19th centuries= Starting in the late 15th century, Lyon once again became a major hub for trade in France. Much was traded in the city, including spices, knives, weapons, and most importantly silk. Silk played a large historical and monetary role in the development of Lyon's economy. Introduced to Lyon in 1466, when Louis XI of France set up the first silk manufacture, the large demand for luxury silk goods by the french aristocracy led Lyon to become one of the worlds major producers of silk. in 1540, King [Francois I] granted Lyon the monopoly of silk manufacturing, ensuring that all silk goods produced in Italy or Asia traveling the Silk Roads would pass through Lyon's warehouses. In the 17th century, it was estimated that the city contained more than 10,000 silk looms, cementing Lyon as the global centre for silk weaving. In 1667 Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the superintended of finance to Louis XIV regulated the quality implications of silk production, and tariffs to be paid to workers. Thanks to these regulations, the social advancements and mastery of silk production helped Lyon become the worldwide capital of Silk in the late 17th century. In 1801, Joseph Marie Jacquard invented a mechanical loom that rapidly industrialized the process of producing silk. Hinderances of the Silk Industry The Revocation of the Edict of Fontainebleau, also known as the Edict of Nantes, forced the Calvinist Protestants, also known as the Huguenots, of France to flee the country for fear of religious persecution. Many of these Huguenots were skilled workers within the silk industry, and their persecution saw a drastic decline in the production of silk. However, the Huguenots greatly participated in the development of the silk industries in Germany, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. The end of Louis XIV's rule also posed a great threat to the silk industries of Lyon. The end of his reign marked a period of war and poverty. Without royal orders for silk, and with an impoverished nation the demand for silk greatly dropped, greatly damaging the industry. The French Revolution proved to be the most damaging period for the silk industry. As thousands of French citizens were either guillotined or shot, much of the skilled labor in France disappeared. Most of the drawings, designs and fabric samples in Lyon were destroyed, leaving hundreds of years of Lyon's history to be no more. As many fled the country, the workforce for the silk industry declined by almost 90%. =Printing= In 1440, German innovator Johannes Gutenberg invented the modern printing press; with moveable characters in lead alloy which allowed for texts to be printed much faster and in larger quantities than its prior wooden ancestor. With the introduction of this new technology, printing industries thus emerged in France in the late 15th century, with the first 50 printing houses in Lyon opening in 1472. In this year, Bart√©lemy Buyer and Guillaume Leroy began publishing legal reference works for the international market, as well as illustrated volumes of religious popularization, and many books on chivalry and medical treaties. Barth√©lemy and Leroy made Lyon the focal point for the circulation of Venetian works throughout Europe. By the early 16th century, Lyon was the 3rd largest printing center in Europe (behind Paris and Venice), containing 181 printing houses. This led to a large influx in foreign printers coming from Germany, Italy, Spain, and other European nations. In 1519, the Great Company of Lyon's Booksellers was created to organize the many printing houses into an economic force. This enabled the town of Lyon to export its printing goods as far as Mexico, Peru, and the Far East. Economic welfare such as this led Lyon to be known as the European printing capital in 1550. Modern industries =20th-century Lyon= The 20th century proved to be a crucial time for Lyon's economic development. Innovations such as the cinematographic camera marked the city as am important location for innovation and culture. This century saw a rise in Lyon's chemical and medical industries, as well as the rise of the French automotive industry. Cinema At the very end of the 19th century, Auguste and Louis Lumi√®re began making a name for themselves in the world of film. The brothers began producing photographic plates in Lyon, a huge success, and by 1894 they were selling over 15 million plates a year. That same year, Antoine Lumi√®re was invited to a showing of Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope, an early motion picture device which enabled viewers to see images through a peep hole. Antoine brought back news of this machine to his sons and asked them to enable the machine to both animate and project to be viewed by many at once. On February 13, 1895, Louis Lumiere created such a machine. The cin√©matographe was a small apparatus that enabled both photographing and projecting at 16 frames per second, which was quicker than Edison's kinetoscope and used less film. Their first screening took place on March 22, 1895, with a showing of Sortie des Usines Lumi√®res √† Lyon which is recognized as the first true motion picture ever created. World War 1 World War 1 saw a significant increase in French employment and forced many industries to make major changes in order to aid with the war effort. Companies like the Gillet firm, which was previously a construction company, became the war efforts' largest producer of gases, predominantly mustard gas. Automotive companies played the largest role in the war effort, with companies like Berliet (presently known as Renault ) whom originally produced trucks for the war, were licensed to produce shells and battle tanks; many of which were used in the Battle of Verdun. By the end of the war, Berliet saw their annual turnover increase fourfold. Overall, the war effort in Frances cities created nearly 2 million jobs, employing over 400,000 women. =Present-Day industries= Leading the way in high tech industries in Europe, Lyon boasts impressive establishments for the development of life-science and green technologies. in 2012 alone, over 5.6 billion euros were invested into Lyon and the surrounding region for research and development in those fields. Chemical industries Recognized as the birthplace of french chemical industries, Lyon still boasts a high density of chemically oriented companies. Over 500 companies in the petrochemical, mineral chemistry, analytics and organics fields reside in the city. The city has produced 2 Nobel Prize winners; Victor Grignard in 1912 for the Grignard Reagent and Yves Chauvin in 2005 for his work in the area of olefin metathesis. Lyon also contains a \\"Chemical Valley\\", located in the South of the city which boasts over 30 world-leading companies into the chemical and energy sectors designated to research and development of new technologies and advancements. Biotech In 2014, Lyon launched its Gerland Biodistrict. This district covers over 100 hectares, 30 public laboratories with around 2,750 researchers providing nearly 35,000 jobs in the city. This massive establishment was created in hopes to spur an influx of major biotech companies from around the world to move to Lyon by offering state of the art establishments and an access to students from some of France's leading Universities. The city has built many districts such as this one, including Biotech park.

Early life Giovanni Pippan was born to Valentino Pippan and Maria Brissek in Trieste. His family may have been of Friulian origin. He was married and widowed some time before 1921. The Albona Republic In the spring of 1921 Pippan was sent by the Italian Socialist Party to organise the striking miners of Labin on the Istrian peninsula. On March 1 he was caught by a group of fascists at the railway station in Pazin, where he was beaten. The news reached Albona the following day and on 3 March the miners assembled and decided to occupy the mine works in response. The miners proclaimed the Albona Republic in the occupied mines on 7 March with the slogan Kova je nasa (\\"The mine is ours\\"). They organized a government and the so-called red guard as a protection from the Italian law enforcement and started to manage the production of mines by themselves with the support of a section of farmers. On April 8, 1921 the Italian administration in Istria, responding to requests for intervention from the mine owners, decided to suppress the republic using military force. 52 of the rebellion‚Äôs leaders were indicted for various crimes, with Pippan being first on the charge sheet. Lawyers Edmondo Puecher, Guido Zennaro and Egidio Cerlenizza successfully defended the accused, and the jury issued an acquittal. Shortly afterwards, because of the threat to his life from fascists if he remained in Italy, he left for the United States. Chicago In the United States, Pippan helped organise the silk workers of Paterson, New Jersey. He was also active in the campaign to save Sacco and Vanzetti and fought against fascist elements in the Italian immigrant community. and became a member of the American Communist Party (1926-1931). In 1931 he went to Chicago where he became involved in the unionisation of bread delivery drivers. In the 1920s and 1930s bakeries in Chicago were controlled by criminal racketeers and delivered bread from door to door on horse-drawn carts. The drivers wanted to reduce their long hours and increase their pay, so in 1933 they approached the Socialist Federation to ask for help in forming a union. Pippan not only formed a drivers‚Äô union, but also began trying to persuade the bakers themselves to unionise and free themselves of racketeer control. He was assassinated in Cicero, Illinois. The date is variously given as 29 or 31 August 1933.

Her research on new family forms has contributed to theoretical understanding of family influences on child development and has addressed social and ethical issues that are of relevance to family life.  Personal life and education  Golombok grew up Glasgow, Scotland, the only child of Clara and Benzion Golombok, and attended Hutchesons‚Äô Girls‚Äô School. Following a first degree in Psychology at the University of Glasgow in 1976, Susan was awarded a Master's degree in Child Development at the University of London, Institute of Education in 1977, and a PhD at the University of London, Institute of Psychiatry in 1982, supervised by Professor Sir Michael Rutter. Golombok married Professor John Rust in 1979 and they have one son, Jamie Rust, born in 1985.  Career  Golombok held research positions at the Institute of Psychiatry for 10 years before being appointed to a Lectureship in Psychology at City University, London in 1987 where she established the Family and Child Psychology Research Centre. She became Professor of Family and Child Psychology in 1993. She moved to Cambridge in 2006 to take up the Chair of Family Research and the Directorship of the Centre for Family Research on the retirement of the Founder, Professor Martin Richards. In 2005, she was Visiting Professor at Columbia University, New York, and in 2019, she was Visiting Distinguished Scholar at the Williams Institute, UCLA.  Research  Golombok has pioneered research on lesbian mother families, gay father families, single mothers by choice, and families created by assisted reproductive technologies including in vitro fertilisation (IVF), donor insemination, egg donation and surrogacy. She conducted one of the first studies worldwide of children in lesbian mother families in the 1970s and of children born by assisted reproduction in the 1980s. Her research has challenged popular myths and assumptions about the social and psychological consequences for children of being raised in new family forms, and has advanced theoretical understanding of parental influences on child development more generally by showing that the quality of family relationships and the social context of the family are more influential in children‚Äôs psychological development than are the number, gender, sexual orientation or biological relatedness of their parents. Golombok‚Äôs research has informed policy and legislation on new family forms in the UK and internationally. She has been invited to give evidence to regulatory bodies including the Dutch State Commission on Family Law, the Swedish Government Inquiry on Surrogate Motherhood, the UK Law Commission, and the French National Assembly Parliamentary Committee on Bioethics. She was a member of the UK government‚Äôs surrogacy review committee in the late 1990s, a member of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics Working Party on Donor Conception in 2012-13, and is currently a member of the International Commission on the Clinical Use of Human Germline Genome Editing. Her research has been used as evidence in same-sex marriage legislation in a number of countries, including the US Supreme Court ruling in 2015, and in legislation on assisted reproduction such as the UK Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 that allowed same-sex parents to be joint legal parents of children born through assisted reproduction, and the 2019 amendment that facilitated single parents becoming the legal parents of children born through surrogacy.

Archbishop Leo played an important role in the arrest of Paul Afiarta and was the subject of letters from Pope Hadrian I to Charlemagne collected in the Codex Carolinus and dated from late 774.  Disputed Election  Following the death of Sergius, Archbishop of Ravenna on 8th August 769, Leo, then Archdeacon, was elected to the throne of the Archdiocese with official papal approval. His election was challenged however by a layman named Michael, backed by Duke Maurice of Rimini with the support of Desiderius, King of the Lombards. Archbishop Sergius had, as argued by Thomas F. X. Noble, been loyal or at the very least refrained from being disloyal to the Papacy in the face of conflict coming from the Lombards. The death of Sergius created an opportunity for Desiderius to bring his influence upon the diocese.n Louis Marie DeCormenin wrote in his history that Leo was imprisoned at Rimini by Lombard soldiers while Michael assumed his seat at Ravenna. Noble's account does not include this detail. Supporters of Michael in the city of Ravenna sent requests to Pope Stephen III for his consecration as Archbishop with the bribe of gifts in return. Stephen refused and according to DeCormenin had Michael excommunicated. Leo's luck took a fortunate turn when during a diplomatic mission to Rome in 770, the mother of Charlemagne, Bertrada of Laon, agreed with Stephen that her son would provide aid in resolving the dispute over Ravenna. Charlemagne sent his missus Hugbald to arrest Michael and bring him to Rome. This allowed Leo to finally take his seat at Ravenna and begin properly as the diocese's Archbishop.Noble, The Republic of St. Peter. pp. 122-124.  Arrest of Paul Afiarta  In 772, following his election, Pope Hadrian I set out to remove the influence of Paul Afiarta who, during the pontificate of Stephen III, had begun moving against supporters of the murdered Christophus and his son Sergius. Hadrian reintroduced those who had been purged by Afiarta and sent him away on a diplomatic mission to Pavia. This intended to allow time for Hadrian to organise a case against him, however the mission did not reach Pavia before Desiderius launched an attack against the Papacy and captured Faenza, Ferrara, and Comacchio. Leo, following this attack, had written Hadrian to request support as Lombard forces began to pose a threat to Ravenna itself.Ibid. pp. 128-129. During this chaos Hadrian decided to act against Afiarta and ordered Archbishop Leo to have him seized at Ravenna on his journey back to Rome.DeCormenin, A Complete History of the Popes of Rome. p. 202. A tribune named Julian was sent on behalf of Hadrian to Leo at Ravenna to request this and he was captured. In a further letter Hadrian gave Leo greater details as to how he should handle Afiarta, ordering that the prisoner should be sent into exile, but Leo, having previously disputed with agents of Desiderius similar to Afiarta, wanted him executed. When papal envoys travelled to deal with Afiarta they found he was deadNoble. p. 129-130. According to DeCormenin, Afiarta was beheaded.  Conflict with Pope Hadrian I  Leo had twice now been at odds with agents of Desiderius and when the Lombard Kingdom fell to Charlemagne in 774 he was relieved of any neighbouring threat. Leo is alleged to have begun to manage the territory of his diocese personally as a new form of the exarchate. This prompted four letters written between 774 and 776 from Pope Hadrian I to Charlemagne, found collected in the Codex Carolinus. Within these letters Hadrian accuses Leo of rendering cities in Emilia and the Pentapolis under his firm control, excluding papal officials from them and the rest of his diocese, and even placing Ravenna under his own personal management. To add greater insult Leo excused his actions, claiming that he had the permission of the Papacy to do this.Noble. The Republic of St Peter. p. 169. Another issue that Hadrian had with Leo was the accusation that he had been in contact with Charlemagne without going through Rome first. In the letter no. 53 of the Codex Carolinus dated 775 it is suggested that Archbishop Leo had personally travelled to the Frankish court to meet with Charlemagne himself. In the correspondence between Hadrian and Charlemagne in 775, regarding the issue of Leo, Hadrian had hoped to achieve a meeting with Charlemagne himself at Rome later that year but by November it appeared this meeting would not happen. Archbishop Leo's role in driving a wedge between the Frankish King and the Pope has been questioned by historians writing on the events. Janet Nelson wrote in her biography of Charlemagne, King and Emperor: A New Life of Charlemagne, that Charlemagne had been supporting Leo's moves against the Papacy to assure the strengthening of his own control over the diocese. In contrast, Thomas Noble wrote that while Charlemagne was indeed disposed towards good relations with Leo, he was in no way an actual supporter of him against Rome. Noble believes this friendly disposition to be a natural result of Charlemagne's initial intervention at Ravenna to seat Leo on his episcopal throne.Noble.

It was founded in 1482, as a Dominican convent to honour Saint Thomas Aquinas (Tom√°s de Aquino). It became the burial place of John, Prince of Asturias. Since the 1970s the monastic church has served as a parish church. The site also contains a museum of natural sciences, and a museum of oriental art.  History  The Dominican monastery was commissioned by the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, with other funds from the royal treasurer and secretary Hern√°n N√∫√±ez de Arnalte and Tom√°s de Torquemada, the Grand Inquisitor of the Spanish Inquistion. Building began in 1482 on a site outside the walled city, and was completed already in 1493, led by Mart√≠n de Sol√≥rzano. The complex has three cloisters: *the Claustro del Noviciado (Cloister of Novices), of great simplicity *the Claustro del Silencio (Cloister of Silence) which is decorated with pomegranates as a symbol of the Kingdom of Granada which was incorporated into the kingdom of the Catholic Monarchs, and with symbols of the King and the Dominicans *the Claustro de los Reyes (Cloister of the Kings), which was intended to provide accommodation for the court, but housed a university of Santo Tom√°s which was established at the monastery in the 16th century. Today, it houses the Museum of Oriental Art, showing art which Dominican missionaries brought to Spain from their travels in East Asia. Built in Renaissance style, it is decorated with stone balls typical of √Åvila, called perlado abulense (√Åvila pearl). The main large polytych altarpiece in the church was painted by Pedro de Berruguete, showing scenes from the life of Thomas Aquinas. The same artist also painted St Dominic presiding over an Auto da Fe for the monastery: this work is now in the Museo del Prado. The monastery became the burial place for John, Prince of Asturias, the son of Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon. A marble monument below the main altar was designed by Domenico Fancelli. While the statue of the prince is still Gothic, the ornamented truncated pyramid on which he rests is in Renaissance style. The stalls in the choir are carved from walnut in Gothic style.  Conservation  The monastery was damaged during the Napoleonic invasion, and by fires in 1699 and 1936. The monastery is protected as part of a World Heritage Site, \\"Old Town of Avila and its extra muros churches\\"; the monastery with a defined area of 1.02 ha is listed as one of ten extra muros churches (that is, outside the walled city) included in the site.

It is also the name of an administrative district (qism) within the Cairo Governorate that includes most of the neighbourhood. Its name means \\"the Red Street\\" in Arabic.  History  A late 19th or early 20th century view over Darb al-Ahmar (specifically near left View of Souq al-Silah street (a former armorers' market), on the edge of the Darb al-Ahmar district. The dome and minaret belong to the 14th-century Madrasa of Aljay al-Yusufi. The area south of Cairo's city walls, between Bab Zuweila and the Citadel, was initially the site of Fatimid and Ayyubid-era cemeteries. Under the prosperous reign of Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad (between 1293 and 1341) the population of the city reached its peak and the area began to be developed in earnest. The city expanded southwards and many Mamluk elites were eager to build new establishments closer to the Citadel, the seat of the sultan's power. Al-Nasir himself encouraged this development and even built some of the palaces northwest of the Citadel for his amirs (such as the Palace of Amir Qawsun), just as he was building his own palaces inside the Citadel. The Bab al-Wazir Cemetery also developed next to the neighbourhood at this time, just outside the old Ayyubid city walls. As a result of this period's development, most of the neighbourhood's notable historic monuments date from the 14th century. From the late 14th century onward, however, Cairo suffered from the Black Plague and its population declined and did not recover until centuries later. Nonetheless, the area did develop further during the Ottoman period. The Qasaba of Radwan Bey (now part of the Tentmakers' Street), for example, was a commercial urban complex developed in the 17th century along the old Qasaba road (now al-Mu'izz Street) and partly aimed at promoting urbanization of the area. The area received further urbanization impetus during the 19th century when Muhammad 'Ali Pasha again redeveloped the nearby Citadel as a seat of power.

URL: https://www.uclg- cisdp.org/sites/default/files/Cairo_2010_en_FINAL.pdf The weakness of central authority has recently created problems for historic conservation, as many old houses are being demolished and replaced with modern high-rise structures.  Geography and description  The district historically consists of the area between the Citadel and Bab Zuweila. However, the modern administrative district (qism) of al-Darb al-Ahmar has different borders: it includes the region south of al-Azhar street (in central historic Cairo, within the walled city) and ends slightly north of the Citadel. The district is part of the Cairo Governorate. The neighbourhood is centered around two or three main streets, one of which is named al-Darb al-Ahmar, giving the district its name. The southern sections of al-Darb al-Ahmar Street officially have different names, however, such as Bab al-Wazir Street (named after a former city gate). Another major street, which branches off al-Darb al-Ahmar street, is Souq al- Silah Street, which was once a market for producers of arms and armor near the Citadel. The modern Muhammad 'Ali Street (Shari'a Muhammad 'Ali) also cuts across the southwestern side of the district.  Demographics  Today the neighbourhood has about 100,00 residents according to some sources, though another census-based source puts the population of the modern district at around 60,000. According to a 2010 report on the neighbourhood, the district includes some of the poorest households in Egypt, with unemployment as high as 60% (mostly among women) and a 45% rate of illiteracy. About 83% of the population was born locally.  Present-day conservation efforts  300x300px Since around 2000, the area has been the subject of a long-running conservation and restoration program led by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, aimed at restoring and rehabilitating historic monuments within the urban fabric of the neighbourhood. Monuments that were restored include the Mausoleum complex of Khayrbek and surrounding structures, the Madrasa of Umm al-Sultan Sha'ban, the Mosque of Aslam al-Silahdar, and the Mausoleum of Tarabay al-Sharifi. The development program also involved the creation of al- Azhar Park, one of the few major green spaces in Cairo, which adjoins the neighbourhood today to the east.

She was involved in a same sex partnership with fellow activist, Lettice Floyd, but not allowed to write to her in prison.  Life  Annie Williams, described as Cornish, taught in local authority schools, becoming a headmistress at Crantock Public Elementary School in Newquay, before joining the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1907. In 1908, Williams spent her school summer break working for the organisation in Bristol and met Lettice Floyd. At the start of 1908 school term, Williams returned to teaching in Cornwall, but attended a WSPU 'At Home' gathering in Plymouth in November. On 14 May 1909, Williams had a poem in Votes for Women. At the end of that semester she stopped teaching and became a full-time WSPU organiser. Williams's sister Edith also joined WSPU and later took over Cornwall branch in 1913, and Williams address was c/o her sister at Glanafon, Devoran, Cornwall. Williams relationship with Lettice Floyd lasted until the latter's death and Williams inherited ¬£3000 and a ¬£300 annuity.  Suffrage Activism  On 29 June 1909, Williams was part of the protest at the House of Commons, arrested and released. In August she was speaking for WSPU at Canford Park, Dorset when attacked by the mob. From 1910‚Äì1911, Williams was in Newcastle organising for the by-election campaign, Lettice Floyd moved up from the Midlands to be with her. Williams opened a WSPU shop in February 1910 at 77 Blackett Street, Newcastle and she spoke at events for the Co-operative Women's Guild and noted that in Newcastle 'Co-operative women are very keen to know about 'Votes for Women'. Williams was then replaced by Laura Ainsworth and moved on to be WPSU organiser for Huddersfield and Halifax before in 1912 and 1913 becoming WSPU Wales organiser, based at 27 Charles Street, Cardiff. Williams and others organised various 'holiday' campaigns in seaside resorts and other areas, such as the Rhondda, which Williams described as ' a unique opportunity for coming into touch with the typical Welsh collier and his surroundings' and as well as her suffrage work, raising awareness, selling the newspaper and speaking at meetings in 'crowded and growing valley towns''. These trips also allowed Williams ' time for hill climbing, for enjoying the wide views of hill and dale, and for drinking in life-giving air'. Williams wrote 'historic Tonypandy' could not 'object to militant methods!' referring to the miners workers rights riots there earlier in 1911. shop window smashed by suffragettes In March 1912, with Lettice Floyd, Williams was one of the 200 or more WSPU members organised to be smashing windows, as the Parliament was considering (and rejected) the Conciliation Bill (to give some women the vote) and was sentenced to one month in Holloway prison. Williams and Lettice Floyd took part in the hunger strike and both were forcibly fed. Williams and Lettice Floyd were among the 100 suffragettes who were honoured, awarded the WSPU Hunger Strike Medal, for Valour'.'' Up to November 1912, Emily Davison had been helping Lettice Floyd & Williams at their open air meetings before travelling by train to Aberdeen to accost the Prime Minister Lloyd-George. In January 1914, Williams visited Christabel Pankhurst, who was in self-imposed exile in Paris. In July 1914, Williams spoke in Batheaston, near Bristol at a WSPU garden party for the Tollemache sisters.  Relationship and later life  The same-sex relationship between Williams and Lettice Floyd was 'open' and lasted from 1908 to the latter's death in 1934. In November 1908, Williams wrote from Cranlock, Newquay to Lettice Floyd, who was then serving a sentence in Holloway Prison, London, but the letter was returned as the prison governor said she was 'not entitled' to receive it. At the start of World War One, when the suffragettes called off their activism campaign, Williams and Lettice Floyd moved from Cardiff to Berkswell, near Coventry, and their relationship continued. In 1920 they helped start the Women's Institute there and Williams was president (for 1926-30; and 1933‚Äì34) until she was at her side when Lettice Floyd died in hospital in Birmingham after surgery in 1934. Williams inherited from Lettice Floyd's will ¬£3000 and annual income of ¬£300. Williams died in 1943.

Biography  = Family = Constance Flower was the elder daughter of Sir Anthony and Lady Louise de Rothschild. She had a younger sister, Annie Henrietta (1844‚Äì1926), who married the Hon. Elliot Constantine Yorke (1843‚Äì1878), son of Charles Yorke, 4th Earl of Hardwicke. = Early life = She grew up in Paris and moved back to London in 1847. In 1851, her father acquired a country estate in Aston Clinton where she lived with her family Along with the sister Anne, she taught to the poor in the Jews' Free Schools around Aston Clinton, and wrote the book The History and Literature of the Israelites. While she was from a Jewish family, her social background was very Christian. In 1877, she married Cyril Flower (1843‚Äì1907), a property developer and Liberal Party politician who later became Lord Battersea. They had met in 1864 through his friendship with her cousin, Leopold de Rothschild. They had no children. In 1888, Lord and Lady Battersea acquired two cottages at Overstrand, a village near Cromer, Norfolk, for the purpose of creating a holiday home. In 1897 their architect, Edwin Lutyens, rebuilt and joined the cottages to form a large mansion in extensive gardens, The Pleasaunce. The gardens were developed between 1902 and 1930 by Lord Battersea and his wife. Lord Battersea died in 1907. = Women's rights activism = Lady Battersea by Alexander Bassano, half-plate glass negative, 1897 Lady Battersea was engaged in temperance movement in the United Kingdom, taking the pledge in 1894, and joined the British Women's Temperance Association. Her political engagement was in part motivated by suffragette Fanny Morgan, and propelled her into the reform movement of women's prisons in England. After scandals of child prostitution committed by East European Jews hit the UK press, she co-founded the Jewish Association for the Protection of Girls and Women (JAPGW) in 1885 as the Ladies' Association for Prevention and Rescue Work, a distinctively Jewish association to shelter and support Jewish immigrants. The JAPGW turned Jewish women immigrant into British feminists, setting the groundwork for the future Union of Jewish Women. The JAPGW also set up the Industrial Training School which trained women to become domestic servants, matrons and home managers. She led the JAPGW until the early 1920s, participating in international meetings and coordinating international rescue operations. Lady Battersea also turned her London apartment and Overstrand compound into shelters for unmarried mothers and women rescued from the prostitution. Her close ties with the International Council of Women helped her fight off the reluctance of the Jewish higher society to admit that a Jewish prostitution problem existed. After joining the executive committee of the National Union of Women Workers, she became the union's vice-president in 1896, and its President from 1901 to 1903. She remained in the executive committee until 1919, and was made Honorary President of the union after that date.

Before Captain James Cook discovered the Hawaiian island chain in 1778, the native Polynesians of Kauai had a complex subsistence economy of fishing and trade among the other islands. In 1835, the first successful sugarcane plantation was established in Koloa, Kauai and was the beginning of a prosperous sugarcane industry. Sugarcane remained Kauai‚Äôs most dominant industry until the mid-20th century. Today, Kauai is a tourism-centered economy with 1,279,968 people visiting the island in 2017. Visitor spending on the island the same year exceeded $1.83 billion‚Äîa 9.3% percent increase from the previous year. However, Kauai still boasts a strong agricultural economy with corn seed being the number one crop alongside coffee, guava, and taro.  Economy before 1778  Much of the history known about ancient Kauai‚Äôs economy stems from archaeological discoveries and legends passed on by native families as the island remained undiscovered by the Western World until 1778. Historians believe Polynesian voyagers started inhabiting Kauai around 600 AD due to carbon dating found on materials around the island. The early settlers of Kauai clustered around the geographic locations which were suitable for fishing and agriculture. The main hub for Hawaiians on Kauai was the East side of the island now known as the Royal Coconut Coast. This was due to the fact that the land and climate was suitable for the growth of coconuts, taro, yams, and bananas. The native Polynesians relied on a mainly subsistence economy in which there were no exchanges of currency. However, an explosive population growth around 1100 caused a systematic reorganization in the structure of their society due to resource scarcity. This led to the emergence of three main social classes: chiefs (ali‚Äôi), commoners (maka‚Äôainana), and priests (kahuna). The ruling chief (ali‚Äôi nui) had complete control over the land and materials of their kingdom and possessed the power to redistribute the wealth at any time. Temporary land grants were loaned by the ali‚Äôi nui to the ali‚Äôi who had the common populace work on the lands. The maka‚Äôainana cultivating the land paid labor taxes to the overseer of the land every week. This land relationship between the ruling class and the commoners was closely related to that of Europe‚Äôs feudalism. The society and economy in pre-1778 Kauai was mainly based around extended families (‚Äòohana). Families were believed to have worked cooperatively on an ahupua‚Äôa‚Äîa section of land that ran from the sea to the mountains. The Polynesians cultivated various different crops including tuber and tropical roots. Taro, yams, and sweet potatoes were also grown in various parts of the island. Hawaiians also domesticated dogs, chicken, Evidence suggests the maka‚Äôainana were able to live well-above poverty levels and enjoyed various activities, games, and sports. Over time, the economy of Hawaii as a whole became more complex over time. Families specialized in certain skills and islands became specialized in certain skilled trade. Although Kauai‚Äôs isolated location made it harder for trade to occur, the islands did participate in the trading of fish, canoes, and bark cloth.  The changing economy  After their discovery by the British explorer Captain James Cook in 1778, Kauai and its surrounding islands became a popular destination for trade ships because of their convenient location in the Pacific Ocean. In addition, the Hawaiian King Kamehameha I unified the Hawaiian islands in 1810. These two factors signified a major shift in the economic structure of both Kauai and its sister islands. For the first time, Kauai shifted to a market economy with the introduction of money and international trade. The islands started exporting Sandalwood and trading with China for its tea. Hawaiians grew a liking to goods offered by Western countries and engaged in busy trade with both Europe and China. This lasted until the local forests on Kauai were stripped of all of its sandalwood. In 1826, New England whaling ships began resupplying and getting fresh water in both Waimea and Koloa on Kauai . Because the whaling economy was one of the most profitable trades for Western traders in the 19th century, Kauai became a major re-provisioning and recreational center for trade ships. By the 1850s, over 500 whaling ships were visiting Hawaii every year. This brought major trade and money flow to the islands until the industry's eventual decline due to the American Civil War through the 1860s.  Sugarcane economy  Although sugarcane was already present in the Hawaiian island chain before Captain Cook‚Äôs discovery, the first successful sugarcane plantation in Koloa, Kauai by Ladd and Company in 1835 was beginning of the sugar boom in Kauai . When the first plantation succeeded, it sparked interest from businessmen from all around the West. The first recorded sale of exported sugarcane was in 1837 when two tons were sold for $200. Additionally, King Kamehameha III introduced the Great Mahele of 1848 which brought private ownership of land to Kauai. Foreign land ownership was also now opened up which led to sugar plantations being spread from the West side of the island all the way to Princeville in the North. As sugarcane requires two thousand pounds of water to produce one pound of sugar, investors chose Kauai and the other islands because of their year-round warm, sunny climate along with high rainfall due to trade winds carrying moisture across the islands. Through the 1850s, sugar exports from Kauai continued to grow to the United States. By 1852, thousands of Chinese immigrants were coming to the region to work on plantations, but was halted with the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 by the U.S. government. Sugar exports soared until the end of the American Civil War in 1865. U.S. tariffs on sugar meant a heavy drop in Hawaiian exports. The 20% to 42% tariffs between 1850 and 1870 meant the profit margin for sugar was greatly decreased for sugarcane plantations. However, the 1876 reciprocity treaty between the United States and Hawaii led to free-duty trade between the two. The Kauai County Government, established in 1905, opened the door for many modern developments in the region. Electricity, roads, airfields, and newspapers began to spring up throughout the island. However, immigrant workers that were involved in the cultivation, irrigation, and planting of sugarcane experienced declining wages and living conditions. Consequently, a failed Japanese-led sugarcane island-wide strike led to many Japanese workers leaving the plantations, and the island altogether. In 1924, rivalries between ethnic Filipino workers, plantation managers, and the Kauai police force led to 16 worker and 4 police officer deaths‚Äîthe most violent labor-related incident in Kauai history. The closing of two major sugarcane plantations, Kilauea and Grove Farm, signified the decline of the sugarcane industry‚Äôs dominance in Kauai.  Tourism economy  The introduction of commercial jet flight to the Lihue Airport sparked the beginning of the tourism industry on Kauai. Furthermore, Kauai‚Äôs acceptance as the 50th state in 1959 helped contribute to this new industry. Kaua‚Äôi Surf, a new ten-story hotel, was opened in 1960‚Äîsolidifying Kauai‚Äôs commitment to tourism. The first McDonald‚Äôs opened on the island in 1971 along with the first stoplight in 1973. Coco Palms, the most popular Kauai resort at the time, was featured in Elvis Presley‚Äôs ‚ÄúBlue Hawaii‚Äù which contributed to the growing popularization of the small tropical island. Native Hawaiians protested many of these changes, but the tourism industry did not slow down. By 1970, nearly 426,000 tourists were visiting the island annually. By the end of that decade, the number rose to over 800,000 tourists. In addition, 80% of Kauai's income was either indirectly or directly tied to tourism by the end of the 1980s. Most residents opposed this new economy as large traffic jams became a daily occurrence along with the large population increase on the island. Hurricane ‚ÄòIniki caused catastrophic damage to the island in 1992. The destructive storm led to over $2 billion in damages to the island‚Äîincluding the demolition of Coco Palms. By 1993, Kauai's tourism numbers halved. However, the island eventually recovered as infrastructure was rebuilt and popular Hollywood movies featured Kauai as their settings, including many scenes in the Jurassic Park movies. The island of Kauai, along with the other islands, boasted record numbers for tourism in 2017. Arrivals to the island grew 7.8% along with a 5.8% increase in days stayed from 2016. Over 53% of the travelers stayed exclusively on Kauai. Daily spending per tourist also increased by $4 to $188.

Pilgrimages along what was to become the road to Mount Osore date back to 862, but its uncertain if the establishment of a maintained road took place before the Nanbu built the Tananbu-kaid≈ç. The Nanbu had a large military camp in Tanabu, so quick movement to the commercial port and border town of Noheji was crucial to the defense of their domain. In the later Edo period, the road gained further defensive significance when foreign ships began to be spotted in the Tsugaru Strait and Mutsu Bay near Shimokita Peninsula. As a result of this, the shogunate ordered the road to be extended to Sai in 1803. In 1808, the Tokugawa shogunate assigned the Nanbu clan responsibility for the defense of a portion of southern Ezo, further increasing the road's defensive importance to the shogunate and the clan.Noguchi Shin'ichi (2005).

Beginnings Racing impresario George R. Bentel and his talented publicist, Bill Pickens, opened The Legion Ascot Speedway on Valley Boulevard/Soto Street, on January 20, 1924. When the track first opened, Jimmy Craft crashed his Frontenac into the guardrail on a curve, and Norris Shears crashed into him, both were killed instantly. In 1926, Bill Bundy and Jack Peticord fatally crashed into Nick Guglielmi, but racing continued. In 1928 the Glendale American Legion Post started promoting the track, and bringing in cars and attracted the best race car drivers such as Bill Cummings, Al Gordon, Ernie Triplett, Kelly Petillo, Wilbur Shaw and Rex Mays, from the American Automobile Association (AAA), it also attracted celebrities such as, Bing Crosby, Andy Devine, Loretta Young, Clark Gable, Charlie Chaplin, Edward G. Robinson, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Clara Bow and Carole Lombard. In 1929 it reopened as Legion Ascot. Deaths on the racetrack Due to the speeds they obtained, there came notable and heavy spectacular crashes at the speedway. Twelve years since the Legion Ascot Speedway opened, only 24 drivers died, it had a reputation for deadly accidents, earning it the nickname ‚ÄúKiller Track.‚Äù by 1933 six drivers died, but still racing continued, and Ascot's crowds were bigger than ever. In 1934 a half-mile oval was built inside the old track. In 1935, Glendale American Legion stopped promoting the races. On January 25, 1936 Al Gordon and riding mechanic Spider Matlock were both killed in a crash, the tragic event caused the end of Legion Ascot Speedway. Four months later the grandstands of the abandoned speedway burned down. Seven years later, Linden Emerson, a former janitor at the track, turned himself in. He confessed that he burned down the grandstand. Today, Multnomah Elementary School and a tract of houses now cover Legion Ascot Speedway.

The rationale is that those who are benefiting will lose motivation to improve their lives on their own. Some may even work to worsen their condition in order to qualify for the aid. Additionally, one argument is that peripheral countries, such as Ethiopia, will not move out of needing aid because of the advanced economy's control. On average, Ethiopia has received 700,000 tons of food aid per year for the past 15 years. In rural Ethiopia, food aid has been provided for over three decades.  Causes  = Climate = Food insecurity is caused by a number of things; drought and other extreme weather conditions, animals, diseased livestock, military conflicts, political instability ‚Äì most of which affect Ethiopia.. Poverty, drought, and land degradation have proved to be problems that lead to the food insecurity. Agriculture is dependent on scarce rainfall and irrigation does not help as only 2% of the land is irrigated. Since the 1960s, Ethiopia's agriculture has not performed well enough to provide. Additionally, crop's low market prices are giving farmers little to no gains. Lack of fertile land prevents farmers from growing their field size to increase yield. Nutrition, diseases, and other health issues also plague the country. 1.75 million people in Southern Ethiopia regions are facing food shortages and will continue to be with the rains being insufficient Due to below average rainfall, large areas are expected to remain in crisis (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification - Phase 3) through 2020. In kiremnt, where rain is actually improving crop production, desert locusts have been spotted which will ruin the crops. Humanitarian assistance delivery has been delayed and irregular across the country and outlook predicts struggles with food in communities throughout Ethiopia will continue.  Major events  * 1970s attempts began to address the food scarcity but the regimes in power; Imperial and Derg, were not able to deal with the extreme droughts. * 1999‚Äì2000 droughts caused food aid imports to spike. By 2000, 16% of the total population received food aid. * 2002‚Äì2003 major drought that brought increased aid once more. Ethiopians affected by food scarcity rose from 4% to over 20%. * 2006 Horn of Africa food crisis hit and worsened conditions. 4.6 million of the 13 million in need of food aid were in Ethiopia. * 2015‚Äì2016 El Ni√±o effects prominently seen in southern Ethiopia as communities attempt to recover. = Conflict = Intercommunal conflict has led to population displacement in the Amhara region, Benishangul-Gumuz, Oromiya, and SNNP region. The ruling coalition, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), contributes to unrest. They have been in power since 1991 and are becoming less unified. Disagreements between the four major parties are growing, risking further inter-ethnic violence. In addition, Ethiopia has hosted more than 900,000 refugees since June 2018. Neighboring countries of South Sudan, Somalia, and Eritrea are sources of these refugees. They are the second largest refugee home on the continent. = Job creation = The illiteracy rate is extremely high despite the rapid output of children from educational programs. With the rate they are coming out of school, job creation can not keep up. Around 50% of the population is under 18 years old which puts pressure on job creation. A further problem seen with the youth is child malnutrition as it is one of the highest in the world and contributes to more than 50% of child deaths.  Sectors  = Agricultural = Agriculture accounts for around 40% of GDP and 85% of the labor force. This dependency creates instability as the agriculture sector is not flourishing. There are other industries; textiles, mining, and energy ‚Äì but these account for a small percentage compared to agriculture. Farmers account for 85% of the 77 million people living in rural areas while living below the international poverty line of US$1. The economy has grown quickly in the past years, yet citizens have not experienced the benefits and stay dependent on foreign aid. Ethiopia ranks 69th in the world by GDP. Like many developing countries, they are working to privatize many sectors in hopes of stimulating the economy.  Aid  Ethiopia is one of the leaders in recipients of food aid in the world and the largest in Africa per capita. They are 7th largest recipient of aid among the other developing countries. At the same time, development aid is the lowest for each citizen. Food scarcity remains a challenge with almost half the population being undernourished today. Aid is currently around $1.9 billion and will need to increase to accommodate for the rising population. The Ethiopia Humanitarian Response Plan estimates that about 8.1 million people will require food assistance in 2019. Countries in Africa have been the main target of food aid for years. The top 8 accounted for 49% of food aid and were: Ethiopia, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Yemen, Bangladesh, Kenya, Pakistan, Somalia, and Sudan. The annual Food Aid Flows Report shows the trends in global food aid which reports Ethiopia being the highest on the list. Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) and the Other Food Security Programs (OFSPs) were introduced in 2005 in order to help the issue. An estimated eight million people receive food aid under the PSNP. The Ethiopian government hoped this would end food aid dependency for millions with three years. Agricultural development was at the heart of the program; implementing a food-for-work deal where Ethiopians would build wells or irrigation systems in exchange for food. There were problems with this being carried out such as delays of food and poor implementation. During drought, the US provides $91 million in aid for food and medicine. Other leading contributors are; UK, Italy, Canada, Germany, and Japan. = Other contributing organizations = * Catholic Relief Services * Food for the Hungry * Relief Society of Tigray and World Vision * USAID's Office of Food for Peace (FFP) * UN World Food Program (WFP) Many organizations are working to prevent Ethiopia from falling into famine. Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria are all at extreme risk for being classified as in famine while Ethiopia along with Niger, Chad, Cameroon, and Eritrea face food insecurity. The worry of the dependency theory is not as high of a priority for these organizations as the immediate issues Ethiopia is facing.

The story follows Luis Fajardo (Kent Gonzales), who returns to his home in Baguio to mourn the death of his twin sister. He is welcomed by his parents‚ÄîRebecca (Sharon Cuneta) and Arturo (John Arcilla)‚Äîin their family, but they remain silent on the truth about the death of his sister. Cast *Sharon Cuneta as Dr. Rebecca Fajardo: A doctor and the passive matriarch of the Fajardo family. Cuneta, the first and only choice for the female lead, accepted the role 15 minutes after Matti offered it to her. The film would reportedly \\"not have pushed through\\" had Cuneta refused to star in it. She was offered the role in December 2018 after working on a commercial for Selecta in Makati. Cuneta shot her scenes for 25 days, and lost weight as a result. Matti characterized Cuneta's character as an unkempt woman. *John Arcilla as Arturo Farjardo: The strict patriarch of the Fajardo family who harbors a secret. There was apprehension as to Arcilla's casting as he was occupied shooting the television series Ang Probinsyano. However, Arcilla accepted the role after Matti offered it to him, and Arcilla traveled back and forth, from Manila to Baguio, to film his scenes. Kuwaresma marked the first time Arcilla and Cuneta had worked together in a film; they previously appeared in a TV commercial. *Kent Gonzalez as Luis Fajardo: A teenager who returns home to attend the wake of his sister, who died under mysterious circumstances. For the role of Luis, Matti sought actors between the age range of 15 to 18 years old, and someone who has \\"the sensitivity and the vulnerability that the character has\\". Matti saw these qualities on Gonzales, whom Matti also found physically fit for the role. Matti added that Gonzales was able to portray Luis' emotional and psychological struggles in the story. Gonzales had auditioned twice and watched Matti's previous horror films in preparation for the role. To shoot the difficult scenes, he had to learn from his more experienced co-stars, doing tension exercises with Cuneta and studying Arcilla's acting technique through his eye and voice projections. *Pam Gonzales as Manuela Fajardo: Luis' fraternal twin sister who died under mysterious circumstances. For the role of Manuela, Matti looked for girls who would pass off as Luis' twin. The production team looked for someone who looks similar to Gonzales without asking him if he had a sister. On the day Matti was to screen test the actresses, Gonzales revealed that he had a sister. Kent's sister, Pam, was given the role of Manuela after Matti found her looks identical to that of her brother. *Guila Alvarez as Salve: A psychic/medium who warns Luis in the beginning of the film. For the role of Salve, Matti looked for a \\"wild card\\" as opposed to casting someone who is \\"sort of over-exposed\\" in film and television to make the cast interesting. Matti offered Alvarez the role, though he was uncertain whether she would accept it since it has been around 20 years since Alvarez last acted, with Ang TV being her most notable acting credit. Production Kuwaresma was produced under Reality Entertainment and Globe Studios, and was directed by Erik Matti. Matti and Dondon Monteverde of Reality Entertainment initially planned to create Kuwaresma in a smaller scale. Matti began work on the film in October 2018, after he left Darna and experienced casting issues on the sequel film On the Job 2. Originally meant to be a \\"quick film\\", more serious work on Kuwaresma was done after Sharon Cuneta and John Arcilla was cast as the main characters of the film and both were given five-page scripts. Filming began in December 2018 in Baguio. Matti selected Baguio as the primary location due to its good food and weather, which he found conducive to filming. The film is set in 1985 in Baguio. For the house of the Fajardo family, a \\"beautiful\\" building which is also \\"scarred, elegant yet mysterious, welcoming yet somber, perfect yet slightly off\\", was used. After Cuneta came on board, Matti and Monteverde began scouting more locations in Baguio for four days, during which time they located a house devoid of any furniture nearby The Mansion. They also used another Baguio house which the owner of the Fajardo residence also owns. The production crew comprised 150 people, who resided in the city for a month and a half. The film's art department worked on painting and clothing for scenes set in different time periods: 1944, 1955, 1965, 1977, and 1985. The script required most of the film to be set at night. The climax, which involves a confrontation between Cuneta and Arcilla's characters, took two days to film. Visual effects were also heavily used in Kuwaresma, including the demon that appears in the film. The demon was portrayed by a man in a basic silicone and latex demon suit enhanced digitally through the addition of textures on the suit and exaggerated horns and hair. Release Kuwaresma was premiered with its director's cut version at SM Megamall on May 13, 2019. The film had its general release in the Philippines on May 15, 2019. Two versions of the film, which were rated R-13 and R-16 by the MTRCB, were released theatrically. The film began streaming on Netflix in select Asian countries in September 2019, under the title The Entity. The film is also set to be screened in various film festivals outside the Philippines, including the Slash Festival des Fantastischen Films in Austria (from September 19 to 29, 2019), the ToHorror Film Festival in Italy (from October 8 to 17, 2019), Madrid International Fantastic Film Festival (from October 22 to 26, 2019) in Spain, the Tokyo International Film Festival (from October 29 to November 5, 2019) in Japan, the Oslo International Film Festival (from November 16 to 27, 2019) in Norway, and at the Bunos Aires Rojo Sangre (from November 28 to December 8, 2019) in Argentina. Critical reception Julia Allende of Philippine Entertainment Portal criticized Kuwaresma for its over reliance on supernatural elements than on character motivations, its characters for being unoriginal, and its plot for being predictable. However, she praised its technical aspects such as the use of bluish-gray color scheme to establish the foreboding atmosphere of the film and the performance of Kent Gonzales who is relatively new in film acting compared to veterans Sharon Cuneta and John Arcilla. She also commended Arcilla's portrayal as an effective villain despite his character not being a well-rounded one. Allende also commented on a missed opportunity to make the film's title (which is Lent in Filipino) more relevant to the film's plot and suggested that the film could have looked into Baguio's folklore as inspiration for the film. Fred Hawson for ABS-CBN News also praised the film's technical aspects and Kent Gonzales's performance. However, Hawson found the plot increasingly convoluted as it progresses and its revelation as unnecessary.

The series is written by Kunihiko Ikuhara with Seinosuke Ito, credited jointly as Be-Papas, and illustrated by Chiho Saito. The series is Ikuhara and Saito's second collaboration following the anime and manga series Revolutionary Girl Utena. Synopsis Japanese high school student Sekai Maihime confesses her romantic feelings to her classmate Midou while on a school train tour through France. A mysterious boy named Sovieul appears, and the train suddenly derails; Sekai is knocked unconscious, and awakens transported back in time with Sovieul to 17th century France.

They again travel to the 15th century, where Sekai and Sovieul are captured by Gilles de Rais.

The term was coined by the feminist sociologist Arlie Hochschil. The movement of these workers is an important topic for research and policy development since the number of international migrants around the world has grown substantially since the 1990s. Details The concept of a global care chain is usually referenced in studies of development, including the United Nations Development Program, which explains that this type of labor is important for the economic development of a country. Care-intensive labor often falls on women due to gender-stereotypes. Many examples exist of women in developing countries emigrating to more developed countries to help provide for their families back home by sending remittances. Migrant workers may fill gaps in the labor market of developed countries, or may help fulfill domestic duties in dual-income households abroad. This mass migration often has detrimental impacts on poorer countries, creating transnational families and loss of formal workers to care for elders, children and the sick within migrant countries. Case studies = Case study of Filipinos in Italy = Italy has had a great influx of 30 to 45 year old Filipina migrants since 1970. This is due to the demand for care workers within Italy since the country does not have a strong welfare and social service program set in place. Thus Filipinos often travel to Italy, the global north, in search of opportunities, but it is common for Filipina migrants to be able to only uphold temporary jobs that are poorly paid, since they are rarely offered permanent contracts. This causes Filipinos to be caught within the global care chain, in which they work low wage, care- intensive jobs so that they are able to send remittances back home. In 2008, the Philippines received $17 billion in the form of remittances, placing the country as the fourth highest remittance-receiving country. = Case study of African female health workers = At the turn of this century, about 130,000 health professionals born in Africa were employed abroad. A case study of African migrant women revealed that many physicians and nurses trained in African countries have been underutilized by countries they migrate to since their training and education is not considered legitimate. To be qualified to perform their chosen health professions abroad, they usually need to repeat years‚Äô worth of training as well as other exams and certifications. This was true for people who had remained in the global south or who had migrated to the global north. Many of these women had to leave the field of healthcare or accept positions with less responsibility than they had when they worked in their original countries of origin. A large proportion of them experienced discrimination in their newly acquired positions as caregivers, whether they remained health workers or were forced to pursue other careers.

The show premiered on Netflix in 2019.  Summary  The documentary shows the legal battles of Demjanjuk, a retired autoworker in Cleveland accused of being a German-Nazi prison camp guard known as \\"Ivan the Terrible.\\" Arrested, denaturalized as an American citizen and extradited to Israel in 1981, Demjanjuk was tried as a war criminal in a highly-publicized trial. Several survivors questioned at trial identified Demjanjuk as Ivan the Terrible. He was convicted in 1988 and sentenced to death, but his conviction was overturned by reasonable doubt, based in part on documents released after the Cold War that identified a different guard as Ivan the Terrible.https://time.com/5716489/devil-next-door-true-story/ Although there was not enough evidence to identify Demjanjuk as Ivan the Terrible, he was identified as a Nazi guard at the Sobibor extermination camp and several other camps. He was deported from the United States to Germany in 2009 and was charged with over 27,900 counts of accessory to murder. He was again found guilty in May 2011 and sentenced to five years in prison. Demjanjuk died in prison while his case was on appeal and so the German legal system will no longer seek a determination on his guilt or innocence. The documentary interviews several figures from the trial, including Demjanjuk's attorney and family members and Israeli and American prosecutors, journalists, and academics. It contains extensive footage from his first trial, including testimony from Holocaust survivors and historical footage from concentration camps.  Polish map clarification  Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki criticized the documentary for including a modern-day map of Poland, with the location of Nazi death camps marked on it. Morawiecki considered that impied that Poland was responsible for the death camps, instead of Nazi Germany. The map was shown as part of a segment from a 1985 television report that first detailed the allegations against Demjanjuk. The map was shown \\"repeatedly in various versions of the series\\", with no explanation that the camps were run by Germans. Morawiecki sent a letter to Netflix about the map, which was from a British press report in 1985. In response, in November 2019, Netflix agreed to \\"provide more information\\" onscreen to clearly show the camps were operated by the Germans. Netflix was thanked by Morawiecki. Vanity Fair on November 15, 2019 noted that it was \\"unclear\\" when the tweaks would be made by Netflix.

The track was built by the French in 1902 and is still an active rail line as of 2019. The train passes at 3pm and 7pm daily, on the rail line between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in the south. The alley is so narrow that local residents must remove their personal belongings, including bicycles and children, before the train passes. Locals often sit on the tracks, drinking tea and playing checkers. The street has become a popular tourist stop in Hanoi, but was closed to tourists by local authorities in October 2019 for security reasons, fearing a severe accident. Tourists would often stop and take pictures to post on social media along the narrow alley. In more recent times, the street was home to squatters and drug addicts amongst numerous cafes and residential buildings. The overcrowded street caused the need to reroute a local train on October 6, 2019, prompting the closure. Local cafes have sprung up to serve the bustling tourist trade along the street and owners are concerned over the loss of business the closure will bring. The VN Express newspaper cites a train driver that has had three close calls with tourists on the tracks, once only stopping only meters from the woman who was taking pictures of the train. Tourists can safely watch the train from the outdoor seating areas of the local cafes; owners will typically move their stools closer to the wall and advise patrons to do so as the train approaches. Many will also post train times on chalk boards in their establishments.

Plot In the story, a couple rob a McDonald's in Tokyo at night. A recently married couple in their late twenties lie in bed, famished; they have little in their refrigerator: a six-pack of beer and some cookies. After drinking and eating all of it, the man recounts to his wife a time he and his friend \\"robbed\\" a bakery ten years ago. The two intended to take all the bread they could from a bakery by force. The man who ran the bakery offers a counterproposal before the two men can act: since he is a Richard Wagner fanatic, if they listen to Tannh√§user and The Flying Dutchman with him in the bakery, he will give them all the bread they can carry. They agree, and the bread is enough to feed the two men for a few days. After hearing of that story, the woman suggests that they do the same thing, despite it being 2:30 A.M. They drive around Tokyo looking for a bakery but all of them are closed; they \\"compromise\\" to \\"rob\\" a McDonald's instead. With ski- masks and a Remington automatic shotgun, they enter the restaurant and demand thirty Big Macs. The three employees working there fulfill the peculiar request. The couple then leave the restaurant and drive until they find an empty parking lot; they then eat four to six Big Macs each until they are full. The man feels calm after this experience.

From this southern terminus, it travels northwest out of Toda, crossing in to the southwestern part of the city of Saitama. Route S5 meets its northern terminus at Yono Junction where it intersects Japan National Routes 16 and 17 one last time and then continues on as the Saitama Shintoshin Route eastward towards the central part of the city of Saitama.

It is situated northwest of Squamish, and north-northwest of Mount Tantalus, which is the highest peak in the Tantalus Range. Its nearest higher peak is Pelion Mountain, to the east. Unnamed glaciers lie on the northern and eastern slopes. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Squamish River and Clowhom River. The first ascent of the mountain was made on July 25, 1960, by Dick Chambers, Jack Bryan, and Howie Rode via the east ridge. The mountain names in the Tantalus Range have a Greek mythology theme, and Ossa Mountain was named for legendary Mount Ossa in Thessaly, upon which the Aloadaes are said to have attempted to pile Mount Pelion on top of Mount Ossa in their attempt to scale Olympus, home of the Greek gods. The mountain's name was officially adopted on June 6, 1957, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Ossa Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. July through September offer the best months to catch favorable weather for climbing Ossa.

Hector Hieronymus Fernando was born 30 September 1903 in Katana. He went to school at St. Joseph's College, Colombo, travelling to the United Kingdom to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh. After qualifying as a physician he returned to Ceylon and established a private dispensary in Negombo, which evolved into a private nursing home and maternity clinic. In 1937 he joined the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP), a Trotskyist political party. He subsequently ran, albeit unsuccessfully, for a seat on the Negombo Municipal Council at every available opportunity in numerous wards. It was only in 1962 that he was finally elected to the Council. Fernando contested the 2nd parliamentary election, held in May 1952 for the seat of Negombo, representing the LSSP. Fernando fell short of securing the seat by 13,325 votes, only securing 24% of the total vote. He was successful in securing the seat at the 3rd parliamentary election held in April 1956, defeating the United National Party candidate, Quintin Fernando, by 2,680 votes (obtaining 47.5% of the total vote). In 1959 the Delineation Commission divided the Negombo Electoral Division into two separate electorates and at the 4th parliamentary election, held on 19 March 1960, Fernando ran in the newly created seat of Katana, where he lost to Wijayapala Mendis, from the United National Party by 6,011 votes. He re-contested Katana at the subsequent parliamentary election in July 1960, falling short of securing the seat by 44 votes. At the 6th parliamentary election, held in March 1965, he challenged Mendis for a third time in Katana and although there was a swing at the elections to the United National Party, Fernando losing out to Mendis again by 2,607 votes. He was denied the LSSP nomination for Katana at the 1970 Ceylonese parliamentary election due to a deal between the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the LSSP whereby the SLFP agreed not to run a candidate in the seat of Balapitiya (which was won by the LSSP candidate, Weerasinghe de Silva) in return for the LSSP not running a candidate in Katana (which was won by K. C. de Silva from the SLFP by 10,781 votes). Despite his disappointment in the party's decision he remained a member of the LSSP until his death on 21 October 2016. At the time of his death he was the chairman of the Negombo South Fisheries Co-operative, which at the time was the largest co-operative project in South East Asia.

Education and filmmaking career Born in 1979 in Starnberg, Germany, Diez developed a love for horror and science-fiction filmmaking in the early 1990s. In a 2015 interview, Diez said: \\"I always felt like I'm a filmmaker at heart. I always made my own movies when I was young.\\" He began teaching himself computer animation when he was fourteen, using \\"the very first computer animation program.\\" Diez worked for agencies and production companies in Bavaria, and made his own videos before enrolling at Baden-W√ºrttemberg Film Academy, in Ludwigsburg, in 2002, specialising in visual effects and animation. He said the video Bullet ‚Äì Highway Patrol (2002), made in three days \\"from idea to finished clip\\", was what got him into the academy. =Student filmmaker (2002‚Äì2007)= Diez had chosen his area of specialisation knowing it was rare that a directing student \\"could make sci-fi and horror films\\"; he \\"consciously chose effects\\" despite this, and, \\"I was lucky enough to do whatever I wanted and still direct live action stuff for my projects.\\" > Making genre films always interested me, and it's sometimes hard, especially > in Germany, when you study directing, to do crazy genre stuff. You try to go > the more serious, dramatic way, which is not wrong, but would have been > wrong for me. So I deliberately decided to study effects because I knew I > could still direct my own stuff. Short films During his first year at the film academy, Diez collaborated with fellow student Marinko Spahiƒá on a short mixed live action animation film titled Druckbolzen (Pressure Bolt, 2003), starring and made for ‚Ç¨250. The short played at several European international film festivals, winning an award at for sound in 2003, and the Shine Award at Bradford, for technical innovation in 2004. Ain't It Cool News called Pressure Bolt \\"stunning\\" and \\"quite possibly the best film ever made for under five hundred bucks\\". Diez teamed with Biehn again, as screenwriter, to make a short comic horror movie titled Martha (2004) starring and Hermann Schevtschenko. Diez and Spahiƒá collaborated again in 2004 on a short science fiction film, 90 Grad Different, starring Steffen Wink. That summer, they began their third and longest project together, a thesis film, an alien invasion thriller with hip hop and gangster rap motifs; the title, Kingz (2007) is derived from hip hop slang. The twenty-minute film stars Mathis Landwehr and pop music stars Bela B, , and , and features martial arts, swordplay, and gunfighting. It was shown at international film festivals, winning Best Short Film at Trieste S+F in 2008 and a M√©li√®s d'Argent in 2009. Todd Brown praised the cinematography and called Diez \\"an effects god\\"; the film \\"fuses a bit of gang culture with bits of horror, scifi, and martial arts action and does it all remarkably well... Landwehr gets time to show his moves and the whole thing just fits together beautifully and cries out to be made into a feature.\\" Five years later, Brown recalled: \\"that short was far and away one of the best I saw in that year, an amazing blend of scifi, action and horror elements that made me a fan for life.\\" Commercial work While studying, Diez did postproduction work on films and advertisements for, among other brands, Festina, Audi, Bosch, and Snickers. =Kingz Entertainment CEO (2007‚Äì2011)= After graduating with a diploma in visual effects and animation, Diez served as CEO for the Cologne-based production company founded for and named after Kingz from 2008 to 2011. Kingz Entertainment provides visual effects for commercials (for Toshiba and Shell, among others). Diez reused footage from an advertisement made for the International Film School Cologne, Keine billigen Tricks (2009), to create a new short of his own, Space Chase. Noncommercial work for which Diez provided editing or visual effects included zombie web series Viva Berlin!, Marissa Maghavipata's short film Singularity, and feature films, notably Lars von Trier's Melancholia. > There's a handful of shots where Kiefer Sutherland and his son construct > this little wire thing, where they look into the sky, onto the approaching > planet, and they create a circle out of wire so they can compare the size > and can determine how fast it's approaching.

Born in the county of Kaiping in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, as a young man he moved to Melbourne, Australia, where his family had business interests. He was active in the Chinese-Australian community as a preacher and Kuomintang organiser, became editor of the Chinese Times newspaper, and wrote the first known novel by a Chinese-Australian author, The Poison of Polygamy (1909-1910). He returned to China in 1924, where he served in various posts in Sun Yatsen's government of the Republic of China. Biography =Early life= Wong Shee Ping was born in Kaiping, Guangdong, in the 1870s. His Kuomintang membership card gave his birth year as 1875, while his marriage certificate listed it as 1878. His father had business interests in Australia, including a gold mine in Ballarat, and spent extended periods of time away while Wong and his siblings remained in Guangdong with their mother. =Move to Australia= In 1908 Wong arrived in Melbourne, where his brother was running a Chinese restaurant. Wong took a job as a compositor with the Chinese Times newspaper before joining its editorial staff and becoming editor of the paper in 1914. With fellow republican Lew Goot-Chee he established the Young China League in Melbourne in 1911. He later moved to Sydney, where he was editor of the Chinese Republic News in 1919 and 1920 and a revived Chinese Times from 1920. During the 1910s, Wong travelled to South Australia and Western Australia, to preach and to help establish local branches of the Kuomintang. The Chinese diaspora community played an important role in raising funds and support for the Kuomintang during this period. =Publication of The Poison of Polygamy= In June 1909, the Chinese Times published the first installment of \\"a social novel\\", The Poison of Polygamy. The novel was written in Classical Chinese and was published in 53 installments in 1909 and 1910. Although the novel was originally published anonymously, historians Mei-fen Kuo and Michael Williams and translator Ely Finch identified Wong as its author while preparing the first English translation of the novel. Wong was a member of the newspaper's editorial staff at the time the story was published. The novel is set in Guangdong, Melbourne, and the goldfields during the Victorian gold rushes and includes commentary on Chinese and Australian society, the White Australia policy, women's rights, marriage, and other social issues. It is the earliest known Chinese-language novel published in Australia, and possibly in the West. A second novel by Wong was serialised in the Chinese Times and the Chinese Republican News in 1917 and 1919, under titles that have been translated as \\"World of Robbers\\" (in the Chinese Times) and \\"The Detective's Shadow\\" (Chinese Republican News). An advertisement for this second novel in the Chinese Times confirmed Wong was the author of The Poison of Polygamy. =Marriage and children= In January 1923 Wong married Ellen Louisa (Cissie) Sam in Melbourne. Their daughter Maude Florence (Bonnie) Shee Ping was born later the same year. Also he was survived by a wife and child in Kaiping in 1948. = Later life = In 1924, Wong returned to China to represent Australasia at the first national conference of the Kuomintang. He was appointed by Sun Yatsen to the party‚Äôs Central Propaganda Committee and became involved with the Hong Kong Morning Post. Later in the 1920s he held various provincial posts in the Republican government of China, and was a member of its Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. It is not known whether he intended to return to Australia, or whether he kept in touch with his wife Cissie after his departure. There are few known records of his activities after 1931. He died in his home county Kaiping in 1948. Political and religious views Wong was a member of the Kuomintang and was active in promoting the republican cause in the Chinese community in Australia. He was a Christian and in The Poison of Polygamy advocated for an end to folk religion, polygamy, and other traditional practices. The novel also suggests that he was well versed in Confucianism. Wong also held feminist views and advocated for women's education and political rights. In 1921, he secured permission from Sun Yatsen to waive membership fees for female members of the Australian branches of the Kuomintang, and to allow women to join party committees.

Nimura, primarily about the lives of Sutematsu Yamakawa, Shige Nagai, and Ume Tsuda. These three Japanese girls were sent to America as part of the Iwakura Mission in 1871, at the ages of 11, 10, and 6 respectively, to receive ten years of American education before returning to Japan in 1882. Nimura explores the personalities and emotional experiences of these girls as they grow into young women and attempt to reconcile conflicting national identities. The title of the book references Etsu Inagaki Sugimoto's autobiography, A Daughter of the Samurai. Unlike Etsu, who moved permanently to the United States in 1898, the earlier 'daughters of the samurai' in Nimura's book do not become Americans, but instead try to bring some part of America to Japan.  Summary  Daughters of the Samurai begins with Sutematsu's traditional feudal childhood, disrupted by violent war, and then disrupted again by Japan's contact with America. Nimura describes the formulation of the Iwakura Mission, and the somewhat haphazard inclusion of five girls in the delegation. The two eldest girls, both aged 14, fell ill and returned to Japan within the first few months, but Sutematsu Yamakawa, Shige Nagai, and Ume Tsuda remained to spend ten years struggling to fulfill their ill-defined mission to acquire an American education for the benefit of Japan. The book follows each girl around the country through many changes in foster families and schools. Ume, the youngest, returned to Japan having completed high school, but no secondary education. Shige received a certificate from Vassar's School of Music. Sutematsu, the oldest, graduated from Vassar College, the first Japanese woman to receive an American college degree. By 1882, all three had returned to Japan, and now faced the challenge of re- integrating their American educations within a home country they had not seen since they were children, and which was no longer as welcoming of modern American ideas. Sutematsu married a general in the Imperial Japanese Army, ≈åyama Iwao, who eventually became Minister of War; Sutematsu became a Countess and then a Princess. She advised the Empress on Western customs, and encouraged high-ranking Japanese women to support Japan's war efforts and volunteer as nurses. Shige married Baron Ury≈´ Sotokichi and became a Baroness, while also teaching at the Tokyo Music School and Tokyo Women's Normal School. Ume, who never married, taught at the Peeresses' School and Tokyo Women's Normal School, returned to the United States to earn a degree from Bryn Mawr College, and eventually, with help from Sutematsu and Alice Bacon, founded the Joshi Eigaku Juku (Women's Institute for English Studies) in 1900.  Research  Nimura began the research which led her to this book when she came across the memoir of Alice Bacon, who plays a minor role in the resulting biography as an American friend of the girls who briefly lived with them in Japan. Of the origin of the book, she says: The book draws heavily on letters written by Sutematsu and Tsuda to their American friends and family, including from Sutematsu to Alice. In an interview with the Japan Times, Nimura described these letters as an unusually fertile resource for biography: \\"They all found incredible release in writing letters in English back to their friends in America... You get these letters that, for Victorian letters, are remarkably frank and have real voices in them.‚Äù However, Nimura's research on Shige was limited by the fact that the collection of her materials held by her family is not available to the public. Nimura located and included many historical photographs. Those which were not included in the book are collected at her personal website.  Reception  When the book was published, the New York Times Sunday Book Review praised the book for its ability to illuminate the different personalities of the three girls and to expand Americans' understanding of the Meiji era. The Los Angeles Review Of Books also praised Nimura's historical research. The Christian Science Monitor praised the story as inspirational, and the Washington Post praised its ability to make the girls' struggles feel relatable. The book also received starred reviews in Kirkus, Publishers Weekly, Library Journal, and Booklist The book also received attention in some non-literary media outlets. Nimura was interviewed for the Japan Times, which also praised the book, drawing particular attention to the way it humanized Tsuda, a famous figure in Japan, \\"revered almost as a patron saint\\" for having founded Tsuda University. The book was also reviewed in Vassar: The Alumnae/i Quarterly, highlighting Sutematsu's role in Vassar's history as \\"the first student of color known to have graduated from Vassar\\", and the magazine published an excerpt of the book's chapter \\"At Vassar,\\" describing Sutematsu's time at the school  References  Category:History books about Japan Category:2015 non-fiction books Category:21st-century history books ","title":"Daughters of the Samurai"},{"id":"62256895","text":"The Red Tapeworm is a 1941 comedy novel by the British writer Compton Mackenzie.

The roller coaster is a Euro-Fighter model manufactured by Gerstlauer, and themed to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT). It is the steepest roller coaster in the world with a vertical drop of 121.5 degrees. TMNT Shellraiser has a similar layout to Takabisha at Fuji-Q Highland in Japan, the previous record holder for world's steepest roller coaster.  History  In September 2016, officials at the long-delayed American Dream Meadowlands shopping mall announced that the Nickelodeon Universe theme park would be built inside the mall. Details about the park's coasters, including a Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter with the world's steepest drop, were revealed in December 2017. According to the mall's attractions director, Jeff Davis, the Euro-Fighter design was chosen because it would \\"break a world record [...] to claim the steepest coaster in the world\\", and that he \\"anticipate[d] up to 50 percent\\" of residents in the New York metropolitan area to ride the coaster. The names for TMNT Shellraiser and three other coasters were first announced by Nickelodeon Universe representatives at American Coaster Enthusiasts' February 2019 \\"EastCoaster\\" summit. At that point, construction on the coaster was well underway. Ride testing began in April 2019. TMNT Shellraiser soft-opened October 25, 2019, as part of the opening of the first attractions at Nickelodeon Universe in American Dream Meadowlands. The ride was temporarily closed after its soft opening because it did not have a permit to operate.  Ride experience  TMNT Shellraiser is located entirely inside the structure of American Dream Meadowlands. It leaves the station and then immediately entering a slow heartline roll. Afterward, it is propelled by linear motors from a standstill to in two seconds. TMNT Shellraiser ascends from the launched track section into a tall corkscrew. Immediately afterward, the coaster enters a banana roll inversion, a second corkscrew, and an airtime hill. The train ascends onto a set of block brakes, slowing the train down before it makes a U-turn to the right and ascends the vertical chain lift hill. Once at the top, the car is held by a brake before entering the 121.5¬∞, beyond-vertical drop. Once the car is released from the top of the hill, it enters a dive loop, an inline loop, and an Immelmann loop, before hitting the final brake run and returning to the station.  Characteristics  TMNT Shellraiser (green track) with other coasters, including Shredder (purple track, teal supports) TMNT Shellraiser has green track with purple and light-blue supports, and has a total of seven inversions. At the top of the lift hill, the train is held by the brake for 14 seconds before being released into the drop. Riders are positioned so that they have a view of the New York City skyline in the distance. A section of the building's ceiling is raised slightly to accommodate the lift hill, as well as the windows facing New York City. The drop, at an angle of 121.5 degrees, is the steepest in the world, beating the previous record-holder Takabisha by half a degree. There are six trains, each with a single car. Each car has two rows of seating, with four seats per row. The trains were given a custom paint design by \\"a local auto body artist.\\" The ride is themed around the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fighting the supervillain Shredder in New York City's streets.

It comprises two fragments; the arch is made of iron decorated with strips of silver, and terminates in a bronze animal head that was cast on. The eyebrow was donated to the Statens historiska museum in November 1880 along with several other objects, all said to be from a grave find in Gotland, Sweden. The eyebrow dates to around 550 to 600 AD, and would have once adorned one of the \\"crested helmets\\" that appeared in England and Scandinavia around that time. Many of these also featured decorated eyebrows, such as the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Broe helmet; the Hellvi example is one of a number of decorated eyebrows that have been found without other traces of the original helmet, including the Lokrume helmet fragment in Gotland and the Gevninge helmet fragment in Denmark.  Description  The back of the eyebrow The eyebrow survives in two fragments, each about long, that originally formed a continuous arch. They are made of iron; the smaller of the fragments terminates in an animal head, made of bronze. The bronze and iron pieces were cast together, the hardened iron placed into the mould of the molten bronze. Both fragments are inlaid, or possibly cast, with vertical strips of silver.  Discovery  The circumstances of the discovery of the eyebrow are largely unknown. It was donated along with other items, all said to be from a grave find in Hellvi socken in Gotland, to the Statens historiska museum in November 1880, and assigned the collective inventory number 6,684. The donation, from \\"the watchmaker Unnerus,\\" was recorded the following year in M√•nadsblad, a monthly publication of the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities. In 1969 Birger Nerman published an illustration of the reconstructed fragments in his volume II of his work on the Vendel Period finds from Gotland, Die Vendelzeit Gotlands; six years later, in volume I, he added a textual description. At some point before 1977, the eyebrow was further conserved at Greta Arwidsson's request, permitting more of its construction details to be perceived.  Typology  The eyebrow has been roughly dated to the beginning of the Vendel Period, during the second half of the sixth century. Based on this period, and location, it fits into the corpus of \\"crested helmets\\", each characterized by a rounded cap and usually a prominent nose-to-nape crest, that appeared around this time in England and Scandinavia. More than half of the known examples are from Sweden; up to twenty are from Gotland alone, although these were typically found in cremation burials and, like the Hellvi example, comprise only a fragment or two. The Hellvi example is one of many crested helmets to have featured decorated eyebrows. The Broe helmet‚Äîalso from Gotland‚Äîand the Sutton Hoo helmet both have eyebrows with animal-head terminals, and inlaid strips of metal. The decorative motif of incised vertical strips has been repeated on other helmets, such as from Vendel and York, in what is probably a cheaper imitation, or an invocation of an earlier style. Other decorated helmet eyebrows have also been discovered alone. These include another decorated eyebrow from Gotland, in Lokrume, an eyebrow from Upp√•kra on the mainland, and an ornate helmet eyepiece from Gevninge, Denmark. The singularity of at least the latter two finds has led to an association with the Germanic god Odin, who reputedly gave one of his eyes to drink from the well of wisdom. Another artefact found in Hellvi‚Äîa Roman mask that saw continued use in the Iron Age, and was found in a house dating to around 550‚Äîhad one eye removed and buried nearby, further suggesting the contemporaneous significance of singular eyes.

The line operates every 35 minutes during peak hours, and 70 minutes during midday and on the weekends. J12 trips are roughly 28‚Äì35 minutes long. Rush hours route J12 trips are extended to the Machinists Place Building which takes roughly 45 minutes. Background Route J12 operates between the Addison Road station & Forestville (8431 Old Marlboro Pike) from 4:25 am to 12:00 am on weekdays and 6:15 am to 11:45 pm on weekends every 35 minutes during peak hours and 70 minutes during the off-peak hours. J12 originally operated out of the Southern Avenue Annex division (formerly known as the, \\"Prince George's\\" division prior to 1989), along with the J11, J13, J14, and J15 up until February 1989, when the Landover division opened. Once Landover opened, all routes were all shifted to operate out of the Landover division. J11, J13, J14 and J15 operated out of Landover division up until the times they were discontinued (J14 & J15 on December 18, 2004), and (J11 & J13 in 2016) was shifted to operate out of Andrews Federal Center division on June 23, 2019. History =Initial background= J12 began operation in 1925 and initially operated as part of the Marlboro Pike streetcar line between Federal Triangle in Downtown Washington D.C. & Andrews Air Force Base in Camp Springs, MD. J12 was later converted into a bus route during the 1950s, before ultimately becoming a WMATA Metrobus Route on February 4, 1973 when WMATA acquired four private bus companies that operated throughout the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Area. J12 begin serving Potomac Avenue & Eastern Market stations, once they opened on July 15, 1977, in the middle of its already existing route. =1978 Changes= On September 25, 1978, J12 was truncated to only operate between Potomac Avenue station & Andrews Air Force Base during the times the Blue Line operated. J12 would still continue to make one early morning and late night trip that operated all the way between the Federal Triangle & Andrews Air Force Base during the e times the Blue Line did not operate. =1981 Changes= On January 4, 1981, route J12 was truncated even further to only operate between the Addison Road station & Andrews Air Force Base. During this same exact time , WMATA created its brand new J11, J13, J14 and J15 Metrobus Routes. J13 would be the new route designation of the original J12 route which basically operated all the way from Andrews Air Force Base up to Federal Triangle during non-Metrorail times prior January 4, 1981. J11 would also operate between Addison Road station and Andrews Air Force Base, just like J12, only with the exception that it would only operate during mid-day times during weekdays unlike J12 which operated as an all-day route, seven days a week. Also, unlike J12, J11 would travel south on Pennsylvania Avenue past the intersection of Suitland Parkway towards the intersection of Machinists Place and then make a u-turn loop onto Machinists Place to get back onto Pennsylvania Avenue, before returning back to Suitland Parkway and entering the Andrews Air Force Base gates, via Patrick Avenue. However; during weekday early morning weekday times before Metrorail Service began operation, J11 would operate on special southbound trips in the exact opposite direction of J13, from Federal Triangle towards Andrews Air Force Base, bypassing Addison Road station altogether. J14 & J15 operated between Addison Road station & Ritchie, via Addison Road, Central Avenue, Larchmont Avenue, Marlboro Pike, Kipling Parkway, Ritchie Road, Ashwood Drive, Dunmore Place, Edgeworth Drive, Central Avenue (J15), Brightseat Road (J15), CentrePointe Office Park (J15), Hampton Mall (J15), and Hampton Park Boulevard (J15). Both routes J14 & J15 would operate all day service on weekdays, in a counterclockwise manner, meaning in the exact opposite directions of each other. Route J14 would only operate during midday hours while J15 operated during the weekday peak hours in the peak direction. =2001 Changes= On January 13, 2001, when the Green Line extension to Branch Avenue was complete, routes J11, J12, & J13 were rerouted to operate to between Potomac Avenue station (J11 rush hour trips only, J13)/Addison Road station J11 & J12 only & Forestville (8411 Old Marlboro Pike) instead of Andrews Air Force Base, by diverting from the intersection of Forestville Road onto the intersection of Pennsylvania Avenue and then J12 & J13, making a turn onto the intersection of Old Marlboro Pike to reach the Forestville terminus. Route J11 would continue to still operate by diverting onto the intersection of Pennsylvania Avenue and turn onto the intersection of Presidential Parkway/Machinists Place to serve the Machinists Place building. The segment of Routes J11, J12, & J13's routing on Forestville Road between the intersections of Suitland Parkway & Allentown Road, the intersection of Forestville Road & Andrews Air Force Base Gates, were replaced by both Routes K11 & K12, which were extended from their original terminus to terminate at the newly opened Branch Avenue station. In October, 2001, due to heightened security at the Andrews Air Force Base, in response to the 9/11 terror attacks that took place, J11, J12, and J13 were no longer allowed to enter inside the Andrews Air Force Base gates (located on Patrick Avenue just off Suitland Parkway), to serve their original terminus at Andrews Air Force Base. As a result, J11, J12, and J13 were truncated to only operate to Forestville (8431 Old Marlboro Pike) instead. Neither J14, nor J15 were affected by this route change since they did not operate to, or anywhere near Andrews Air Force Base. However; due to the sudden, unexpected nature of these route changes, WMATA was not able to update its J11, J12, J13, J14, & J15 Marlboro Pike Line Schedule, to reflect those route changes until June 30, 2002 =2004 Changes= On December 18, 2004, when Morgan Boulevard & Largo Town Center stations opened, routes J14 & J15 were discontinued and replaced by Prince George's County \\"TheBus\\" Route 24 . Prince George's County The Bus Route 24 was extended from its original terminus at District Heights, to operate up to the newly opened Morgan Boulevard station, via Kipling Parkway, Ritchie Road, Ashwood Drive, Dunmore Place, Edgeworth Drive, Ritchie Road, Central Avenue, Hampton Mall, Hampton Park Boulevard, and Brightseat Road. Despite this route change, Prince George's County The Bus Route 24 still kept operating on the segment of its route by the Penn Mar Shopping Center in Forestville, MD. =2007 Changes= On June 24, 2007, as the Blue Line began operating earlier in the morning on weekdays, northbound J13 trips operating from Forestville towards Federal Triangle as well as a special southbound J11 trip operating back from Federal Triangle towards Forestville (basically operating on the same exact routing as J13, but in the exact opposite direction, remaining straight on Marlboro Pike, bypassing the Addison Road Metro Station altogether) were discontinued.. Additionally, the special Saturday early morning J13 southbound trip from Potomac Avenue station towards Forestville, as well as a special Sunday early morning J13 northbound trip from Forestville to Federal Triangle, were discontinued, as Metrorail Service began operating during those times. As a result of these changes, the segment of J13's weekday and Sunday early morning northbound and southbound routing between the Potomac Avenue & Federal Triangle, via Eastern Market and Archives stations, was discontinued. Route J13, only operated one special early morning Saturday trip in only the northbound direction from Forestville to the Potomac Avenue. J13 service on weekday and Sunday early mornings, were discontinued. The segment of J11's special weekday early morning routing between Federal Triangle and the intersection of Marlboro Pike & Larchmont Avenue in Coral Hills was also discontinued. =2016 Changes= On June 26, 2016, both routes J11 & J13 were discontinued and fully replaced by route J12.

The VC model places the holder of a credential at the center of the identity ecosystem, giving individuals control of their identity attributes. This contrasts with the federated identity management (FIM) model, as adopted by SAML and OpenID Connect, which places the identity provider (IdP) in the central role as the dispenser of identity attributes and the determiner of which Service Providers (SPs) it will give them to. In the federated model a user's privacy is violated, since the IdP knows every SP that the user visits. The W3C VC model, on the other hand, parallels the way we use identification cards today: the user holds plastic cards in their wallet, and can present them to anyone at anytime without requiring the permission of the card issuer. Such a model is decentralized and gives much more autonomy and flexibility to the participants. The holder of a verifiable credential sits at the center of a triangle of trust, mediating between issuer and verifier. The issuer and holder trust each other, the holder trusts the verifier, and the verifier trusts the issuer. Any role in the triangle can be played by a person, an institution, or an IoT device. The W3C VC standard defines the syntax and semantics of Verifiable Credentials. Many different protocols are being specified for carrying VCs from the issuer/IdP to the holder, and the holder to the verifier. Examples include: * Aries RFC 0036: Issue Credential Protocol 1.0. , and Aries RFC 0037: Present Proof Protocol 1.0 * David W Chadwick, Romain Laborde, Arnaud Oglaza, Remi Venant, Samer Wazan, Manreet Nijjar ‚ÄúImproved Identity Management with Verifiable Credentials and FIDO‚Äù, IEEE Communications Standards Magazine Vol 3, Issue 4, Dec 2019, Pages 14-20 However, none of these protocols are standardized yet, and other competing protocols may still emerge. Many people who are experimenting with VCs today are using some flavor of HTTPS to carry VCs between the various parties. It is anticipated that in due course the most popular or de-facto protocol(s) will be standardized by the W3C or another standards body once more experience is gained. One interesting feature of VCs, is that the holder of a VC does not always have to be the subject of the credential. In most cases users will hold their own VCs, just as we carry physical credentials around with us today i.e., the holder and the subject will be the same entity. But this will not always be the case. For example, when the VC subject is a pet, and the VC is a vaccination certificate, the holder may be the pet's owner; when the VC subject is an infant, and the VC is a birth certificate, the holder may be one or both parents. Verifiable Credentials may be expressed using JSON. A VC is typically composed of: the context of the VC, the identity of the issuer, the date and time of issuing, the expiry date and time, the type of VC, the subject of the VC, one or more identity attributes of the VC subject, and finally the cryptographic proof created by the issuer to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the VC. No single proof mechanism is standardized. On the contrary, the data model is flexible enough to support multiple existing cryptographic mechanisms, such as digital signatures. Proof mechanisms that are currently being used by implementors include: JSON Web Tokens with JSON Web Signatures, JSON-LD proofs, and zero-knowledge proofs using schemes such as IBM's anonymous credentials. The context of the VC, defined using the \`@context\` JSON property, is a JSON-LD construct that allows user friendly terms to be used for JSON properties. According to the VC data model, the value of many properties must be a URI. Whilst these are globally unambiguous, which is an important feature for an internationally standardized data model, they are not user friendly. Consequently the \`@context\` property allows short-form, user- friendly aliases to be defined for each URI. This makes it much easier, and more user friendly, to specify VCs. An example is given below { \\"@context\\": [ \\"https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1\\", \\"https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1\\" ], \\"id\\": \\"http://example.edu/credentials/3732\\", \\"type\\": [\\"VerifiableCredential\\", \\"UniversityDegreeCredential\\"], \\"issuer\\": \\"https://example.edu/issuers/14\\", \\"issuanceDate\\": \\"2010-01-01T19:23:24Z\\", \\"expirationDate\\": \\"2020-01-01T19:23:24Z\\", \\"credentialSubject\\": { \\"id\\": \\"did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21\\", \\"degree\\": { \\"type\\": \\"BachelorDegree\\", \\"name\\": \\"Bachelor of Science and Arts\\" } }, \\"proof\\": } W3C VC's are extensible. Not only can any new property be added to VCs, as determined by the issuer, but there are also some standard properties that have been defined specifically as extension points. These include the following: ; terms of use : these are restrictions placed on the use of the VC by the issuer ; schema : this defines the schema for the content of the VC ; evidence : this allows the issuer to say what evidence it collected about the subject and/or attributes before issuing the VC ; status : pointers to where a verifier can discover the current status of a VC (e.g., whether it has been revoked).

About The monument is an integral part of the Khojaly‚ÄìGadabay cultural heritage. The tower is a local important architectural monument. Maiden Tower is located in a densely wooded and mountainous area about 7-10 km from Soyudlu village. The tower was raised on a rocky shore along the Shamkir River. It is possible to climb on foot to the castle, which is surrounded by greenness and forests. The castle consists of five circular columns. Entry and exit are invisible. Columns are various in height and diameter. Circular-shaped constellations rise from the corners of the fort. The tower has two levels inside, which correspond to the rugged mountain relief. On the top floor, in the highest part of the mountain, there is a five-corner shaped inner tower. At the lower level, the second section of the fort is located. The part of the monument, which passes through the walls and constellations as a belt and completes the crown above, greatly enhanced the protection of the tower. Mountain towers were usually built of surrounding rocks and stones brought from river beds. The difference between the tower and other mountain forts is that its walls were made of baked bricks, and were covered with a number of polished bricks. History At this time, it is not known what the historic significance of the tower and when it was built. Some researchers consider it to be the work of the 12th century - the Eldiguzids - era, because of its basic construction material and architectural features. But according to various sources the tower was built in 9th century. In official sources it is considered that built in 9-11th centuries.

His work makes interventions into several academic fields including Social Movement Studies, Lacanian Psychoanalysis, Cultural Sociology, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Anarchist Studies, and Aesthetics. His work attempts to introduce an alternative to scholarly discourses that aim to produce consistent and coherent bodies of knowledge (e.g., \\"University Discourse\\"). It also offers a counterpoint to what Jacques Lacan has called \\"capitalist discourse.\\" He helped to contribute to the emergence of a new field of scholarly investigation known as \\"post-anarchism.\\" He founded and edits the journal Anarchist Developments in Cultural Studies.  Biography  Duane was born in Miramichi, New Brunswick to Catholic parents. He attended the New Brunswick Community College and graduated with a diploma in Electronic Game Design. After participating in a hunger strike for admittance, he was accepted as a Sociology Major at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton. During this first year of his university education, he experienced devastating poverty, sleeping on park benches. He received numerous prestigious awards, including the Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick silver medal for excellence in scholarship. He went on to complete a Master's degree in Sociology from the University of New Brunswick before joining the PhD program in Cultural Studies from Trent University, Peterborough (Ontario, Canada). During his time in Peterborough, Ontario, he became a Freemason. He was awarded the Governor General of Canada Gold Medal for his research into clinical psychoanalysis and continental philosophy. He studied also at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland, working as an assistant for Slavoj Zizek and Alain Badiou. In 2016, Duane raised more than $100,000 to help rebuild a mosque that was attacked in a hate crime in Peterborough, Ontario. His efforts received international attention and he was invited for a private meeting with the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau. This was the subject of a documentary film by Matthew Hayes, The Masjid. Duane received several death threats at this time and went into hiding. Duane converted to Islam in order to marry his partner. This relationship was documented by Colin Boyd Shafer in his documentary photo exhibit Interlove Project. Duane is no longer married. In 2019, Duane moved to Mumbai, India.  Sociological Theory  Duane Rousselle describes his approach to sociological theory in the following way: > Why, then, do I intend to avoid coherent introductions, sustained overviews, > and/or consistent bodies of knowledge? When knowledge is the agent of a > discourse -- that is, when, from the place of knowledge, there is an > interrogation of that which has not yet been interrogated or not yet known > -- we can be sure we are within what Jacques Lacan named the 'university > discourse.' [...] Many sociologists will be disappointed [...] because [this > work] aims to frustrate the demand for a consistent body of knowledge. The > academic sociologist might therefore inquire into the lack of > comprehensiveness or into the various exclusions or lack of detail > concerning several major early American sociologists [...] Or perhaps the > academic sociologist might expose an inadequacy in the various summaries of > the work of George Herbert Mead, Talcott Parsons, C. Wright Mills, Erving > Goffman, Charles Horton Cooley, or even, why not, Jacques Lacan. Similarly, > an academic reader might protest that this text does not extensively > delineate or explicate the various [...] schools of sociological thought > such as conflict theory, structural-functionalism, systems theory, symbolic > interactionism, applied sociology, and so on. My claim is that these demands > demonstrate something important about the discourse from which the American > sociologist is inevitably trained to speak. By contrast, Rousselle's work draws a distinction between 'analytic discourse' and 'university discourse': > [T]he former is aimed at making an intervention into another discourse by > engaging with its foundational presuppositions, and the latter intends only > to increase the scope of its own knowledge (which is fundamentally built > around an unacknowledged and latent presupposition. This technique is repeated many of his other publications, including _Gender, Sexuality & Subjectivity_ where Rousselle links the notion of 'intervention' with that of 'invention,' and offers a pathway forward for thinking about queer and trans* theory.  Post-Anarchism  Rousselle's contribution to the field of study known as post-anarchism has occurred through several venues. First, in After Post-Anarchism he demonstrated that post-anarchism is an attempt to understand the logical movement of thinking within the field of anarchist studies. By examining the work of Georges Bataille he demonstrated that there is another possible pathway forward. He wrote: > We can now distinguish three stages in the life of post-anarchism. First, we > can deduce what Sureyyya Evren has described as its introductory period > [...] defined by its inability to side-step the ontological problem in the > literature of classical anarchism. During this period, post-anarchism needed > to distinguish itself from classical anarchism while nonetheless remaining > committed to its ethical project. The second period overcomes the problem of > the separation of post-anarchism from classical anarchism by re-reading the > classical tradition as essentially post-anarchistic. Some of the critiques > of post-anarchism are included into this period insofar as post-anarchism, > for them, was always already anarchism. Whereas the first and second phases > included only explicitly anarchist literature under their rubric of > worthwhile investigation, in the third period this no longer holds true. To > be certain the second period permitted the incorporation of post- > structuralist literature into post-anarchist discussions, but always with a > certain amount of reservation. The third period, the one that is to come-- > the one that is already here if only we would heed its call--will not take > such care with attempts at identification or canonization. An after to post- > anarchism is no joke, it is already here, like a seed beneath the snow, > waiting to be discovered. His work went on to demonstrate that post-anarchism's attack on representative ontologies meant that it was forced to avoid entirely all ontological questions. The third period of post-anarchism will therefore be an attempt to return to a non-essentialist and non-representative ontology. This was the approach he and Jason Adams attempted to open up in a special issue of Anarchist Developments in Cultural Studies. Duane helped to popularize the field of post-anarchism also through an inaugural issue of Anarchist Developments in Cultural Studies titled \\"Post-Anarchism Today\\" which included a number of the most popular post-anarchist scholars and art from the Turkish art collective ic-mihrak. He and Sureyyya Evren also published an edited anthology titled Post-Anarchism: A Reader with Pluto Press.  Lacanian Realism  Lacanian Realism was the first known sustained attempt to engage Lacanian psychoanalysis with thinking in the field of philosophical new realism. Katerina Kolozova, in her preface to the book, wrote: > Rousselle's book is the first extensive and compelling elaboration of a > proposal made by Slavoj Zizek almost fifteen years ago -- to reintroduce the > Lacanian Real into the political discourses of the twenty-first century. It > coincides with similar projects undertaken by the political theory > influenced by Francois Laruelle, Alain Badiou, and a number of variations of > what is habitually dubbed as 'speculative realism,' in particular in the > niches of gender and queer theory in object oriented ontologies, non- > philosophy, and its version of posthumanism. Rousselle himself writes about his project in the following way: > I claim that Lacanians have been preoccupied with a particular modality of > the real, one that insists on interrupting, limiting, or exceeding the > various orders or agencies of the human mind. For example, this is the > salient position of Slavoj Zizek, Alenka Zupancic, Bruce Fink, Lorenzo > Chiesa, Joan Copjec, and many others. It is also frequently the position of > Jacques Lacan. [...] One must, as a consequence of holding this position, > bracket questions pertaining to things outside of the symbolic and imaginary > psychical systems. Careful study exposes the extent to which this position > has influenced each of the major fields of research inspired by Jacques > Lacan: clinical psychoanalysis, radical political theory, and mathematical > topology. My task has been to explore the consequent occlusion that > psychoanalysis has suffered in each of these three fields and to tease out > the possibility of a return to the subject of the real.  Gender Theory  With the publication of Gender, Sexuality and Subjectivity, Rousselle begins to retroactively describe his work as 'interventionist.' His attempt is to use Lacanian logic to resituate the terms of debate between queer and trans* theories. He does a brief and yet critical examination of the field of gender theory to demonstrate the way in which \\"progressive gender theories sometimes appeared [...] to be regressive, and vice versa. The only way forward was to consider the ostensibly absurd possibility that [gender theories] be understood as a surface akin to a sheet of paper. This surface might be vectorized and the short edge twisted one hundred and eighty degrees and reattached to the other short edge. A continuous non-orientable surface was invented, whicha counted for the possible movement from progressive to regressive or reactionary gender politics.\\" Rousselle therefore introduces a topological meta-theoretical model for situating the interventions of gender theorists. His argument is that gender theory exists as a debate between ontology and epistemology, being and discourse, and that this leads theorists to conclude that the penultimate contribution of queer theory, derived from social constructionism and related schools of thought, is the malleability of language. The major contribution of trans* is a notion of invention. Therefore, \\"the controversial claim of this book is that queer theory and intersectionality - and, more broadly, the social constructionist paradigm - have reached their limit. Indeed, it is possible that they are now regressive theories. However, it is possible to move forward into a new paradigm through a logic that Rousselle names 'gender invention.'\\"  Books  * Post-Anarchism: A Reader (Pluto Books) * After Post-Anarchism (Repartee Books/LBC) * Lacanian Realism: Political and Clinical Psychoanalysis (Bloomsbury Books) * Jacques Lacan and American Sociology: Be Wary of the Image (Palgrave) * Gender, Sexuality, and Subjectivity: A Lacanian Perspective on Identity, Language and Queer Theory (Routledge) * On Love: Psychoanalysis, Religion, and Society (forthcoming)  Chapters  * ‚ÄúJacques Lacan,‚Äù Palgrave Encyclopedia of the Possible (Vlad Glaveanu, Ed.).

Biography  Ozaki was born to Tomoya and Shobu Ozaki in Kochi prefecture, Japan on November 1, 1904. He moved to Hawaii when he was 12, joining his parents who were already living there in Kauleau on the Big Island. He attended Hilo High school. He got a job at the Hawaii Mainichi, a local Japanese language newspaper in 1920. In 1923 he was hired as a teacher by the Hilo Japanese language school. An avid poet, Ozaki was one of the founding members of the Gin-u shisha tanka poetry club in Hilo when it was established in 1923. Ozaki also was a consular agent for the Japanese Consulate General. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Ozaki was arrested by the FBI and incarcerated in the mainland United States. For the next three years he was held in internment camps in Kilauea, Sand Island, Angel Island, Fort Sill, Camp Livingston, and Santa Fe. In May 1944, he reunited with his wife, Hideko, and his children, Earl, Carl, Sachi, and Alice, in the Jerome War Relocation Center in Arkansas. They were later moved to the Tule Lake camp in California, and lived there until the end of the war. During this time, Ozaki wrote his poems in small letters on rice paper so that he could easily take them with him as he moved from camp to camp.

Early Years  Born to a family of couturiers in Rome, Italy, Susanna Perini was already exposed to sartorial craftsmanship since a very young age. After finishing her bachelor's degree, Perini took up photography and went to Bali, Indonesia, for an assignment by weekly magazine IO Donna. The young Italian was inspired by the culture of the tropical island, from the various ceremonies to the details related to the customs and traditional clothing pieces. She made Bali home and married American designer Paul Ropp there. After giving birth to two children, Nova Ropp and Sayang Ropp, they went separate ways.  Fashion design  In 1994, Perini opened the first BIASA store in Seminyak, championing chic tropical style with white linen fabrics. To date, the brand grew with six stores in Bali and one store in Kemang, South Jakarta.  Art  Inspired by her dialogues with Indonesian artists, Perini opened BIASA ArtSpace in 2005. The institution exists to get recognition for Indonesian artists from art collectors in and from outside Indonesia.

It was founded in 2014 by Richard W. Hughes & Wimon Manorotkul and their daughter, E. Billie Hughes. Their idea was that, while precious stones were articles of great beauty, the lab reports issued by gem labs better resembled blood tests from a doctor than a celebration of that beauty. Thus they set about creating lab reports that were both scientifically accurate and aesthetically beautiful. Lotus Gemology's lab report covers are color coded. Gold reports are reserved for gems that are completely untreated, while silver reports are for gems that have been subjected to industry-standard treatments. Black reports are reserved for heavily treated and man-made gems. This consumer- friendly approach is unique in the industry. When Lotus Gemology first opened, they specialized in testing only ruby, sapphire and spinel. Due to customer demand, they began testing other colored gemstones in 2018. Richard Hughes and Wimon Manorotkul began their gemological careers in Bangkok in 1979. Since then, this family team has over 200 publications to their name. This includes eleven gemology books that they have either authored, co-authored, or edited. In 2017, Lotus Gemology published Ruby & Sapphire: A Gemologist's Guide, arguably the most complete book ever to appear on a single gem species (corundum). Lotus Gemology gemologists are in high demand as speakers and have delivered over a hundred lectures and classes around the world on various gemological topics. In 2019, Shanghai's Tongji University created a special exhibit dedicated to Lotus Gemology's photography. Laboratory Services Lotus Gemology issues reports on all types of gemstones with the exception of diamonds and pearls. For certain types of gemstones (mostly ruby, sapphire and spinel), opinions on geographical origin may be given. All gems are tested for treatments of any kind and Lotus gemologists have been at the forefront of treatment identification for decades, with many papers having been published on this subject. Laboratory Equipment Lotus Gemology is equipped with a full suite of modern gemological instruments such as both gemological and research microscopes, photomicrography stations for both normal and ultraviolet photography, micro Raman spectroscopy and standard Raman analysis, UV-Vis-NIR and Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (ED-XRF) and Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) for chemical analysis. A full set of standard gemological instruments is also employed. Education A big part of what Lotus Gemology does is in the realm of education. For example, their Hyperion Inclusion Database is the first of its kind, a public, fully curated keyword-searchable database of inclusions in gemstones to help gemologists better understand and identify the gems they work with. Lotus Gemology also has created a free reference search engine for gems and gemology. Dubbed the \\"Four Treasures\\" after the Chinese phrase for writing implements, this database contains over 5000 references on gemological topics. This allows anyone to research various subjects. The majority of references relate to ruby, sapphire, spinel and jade. In addition to Hyperion and the Four Treasures databases, LotusGemology.com contains dozens of open-access articles on all aspects of gemology. This includes regularly updated articles that track the prices of ruby, sapphire, spinel and jade at auction. Memberships The laboratory and/or its staff are members of several gem trade organizations, including the Accredited Gemologists Association (AGA), the Gemmological Association of Great Britain (Gem-A), the invitation-only Gemstone Industry & Laboratory Conference (GILC), the International Colored Stone Association (ICA) and the Thai Gem and Jewelry Traders Association.

The tractate has fourteen chapters divided into 101 mishnayot, or paragraphs.

She was arrested four times, and once hanged in effigy. She was finally executed . After her death, she was remembered as an infamous Breton. Biography Marion was born to F√©licien Tromel and H√©l√®ne Kerleau on May 6, 1717 in the hamlet of Porz-en-Haie, near Le Faou√´t, Morbihan. She was the third child of five, with two older brothers, Fran√ßois (1712) and Corentin, then a younger sister Louise (1719) and a younger brother Ren√©- F√©licien (1721). In 1737, at the age of twenty, Marion had her first child of four with Henri Pezron, a servant at Gu√©m√©n√©. The first records of her criminal activity date from 1743. A master tailor, Fran√ßois Hellou, was attacked on the road to Priziac by a band of criminals, armed with sticks and pistols. He identified Henri Pezron and Marion's brother Corentin among his attackers. The same year, Marion was caught giving counterfeit coins to a man called Le Parlouer at the Croisty fair. This was when she was given the nicknames Marion du Faou√´t and Marie Finefont (\\"Finefont\\" meaning, in Breton, very cunning). It was not long after this that Marion became the leader of the emerging group of bandits: the latest year attested for her leadership therein is 1745. Brice Evain describes the group as pragmatically targeting craftsmen, merchants, and well-to-do peasants, but not the nobility, whose victimisation was more likely to bring more serious consequences. The official website for tourism in Brittany, however, describes her as \\"a kind of Breton Robin Hood who robbed from the rich to give to the poor.\\" In 1746, Marion du Faou√´t, Henri Pezron, and their associates were arrested. Henri Pezron was hanged. Marion du Faou√´t was beaten, branded with a V (for voleur, \\"thief\\"), and banned from Rennes. Nonetheless, she returned to Faou√´t and assembled a new bandit troupe. Arrested again in 1748, she was again banished, this time from the whole province. Again, nonetheless, she returned to Faou√´t, and raised a new troupe. Brice Evain calls the years 1748-1752 \\"the golden age of the troupe\\" (l‚Äô√¢ge d‚Äôor de la troupe): they refined their skills as highwaymen, specializing in attacking traders returning from fairs, especially foreign traders. In 1752, Marion was arrested in Poullaouen and taken to the prison in Quimper, from which she escaped. In 1753, she was hanged in effigy. In October 1754, she was arrested in Nantes, and taken to the prison in Bouffay. During questioning, she gave her name as Marion du Faou√´t; recognizing her, the judges transferred her to the prison in Quimper. This time, she did not escape: she was sentenced to hanging, and was executed August 2, 1755, at the age of thirty-eight.  In popular culture  Marion became a legendary figure in Breton oral traditions after her death. Over time, she came to function as a bogeyman used by parents to frighten children into good behavior. These were first recorded by the historian Julien Tr√©v√©dy in 1884, in Breton Studies: Marion du Faou√´t, leader of thieves (Etudes Bretonnes: Marion du Faou√´t, chef de voleurs (1715-1755)). He says that he was going through the papers of the Quimper prison, researching something else, when he saw Marion's name and was vividly reminded of the legendary figure he had heard of growing up, thus prompting a new line of research into her life. The next work on Marion was Jean Lor√©dan's Poverty and thieves in the 18th century: Marion du Faou√´t and her \\"associates\\" (La grande mis√®re et les voleurs au XVIIIe si√®cle : Marion du Faou√´t et ses ¬´associ√©s¬ª), published in 1910. In 1975, Colette Cosnier (fr) wrote a play casting Marion as a feminist hero, presenting an idea of Breton womanhood that was the opposite of the famously silent, obedient figure of B√©cassine.. The play was titled \\"Marion du Faou√´t/The strumpet with red hair\\" (\\"Marion du Faou√´t/La catin aux cheveux rouges\\"). In 1997, a two-part TV movie of her life was made in France, Marion du Faou√´t: Chef des Voleurs (Marion du Faou√´t: Leader of Thieves), starring Carole Richert as Marion. In 2009, Marion was the subject of the song \\"Marionig\\" on Alan Stivell's album Emerald. In 2013, Marion du Faou√´t was one of nine women featured in a campaign in Rennes with the slogan \\"Too few streets are named after women\\" (Trop peu de rues portent un nom de femmes): Marion was proposed as a notable Breton who deserved to be memorialized. The Coeur de Bretagne (\\"Heart of Brittany\\") travel listing for Le Faou√´t names Marion as the area's major historical figure.

Whitcomb (July 30, 1903 - October 12, 1984) was an American attorney and political figure from Vermont. A Republican, he was most notable for his service as United States Attorney for the District of Vermont. Early life Louis Gorman Whitcomb was born in Taunton, Massachusetts on July 30, 1903, a son of Louis A. Whitcomb and Mary E. (Gorman) Whitcomb. He was raised in Taunton until he was 14, when his family relocated to Springfield, Vermont. Whitcomb graduated from Springfield High School in 1921. He taught school before deciding on a legal career. In 1929, he received his LL.B. degree from Suffolk University Law School. Start of career Whitcomb was admitted to the bar in 1929 and practiced in Springfield. In the 1920s and 1930s, Whitcomb and friend Everett Williams, the station manager of WNBX in Springfield, hosted a weekday morning radio show. A Republican, Whitcomb served as a Springfield justice of the peace from 1923 to 1953. Whitcomb joined the United States Navy for World War II and served from 1943 to 1945. After completing his initial training at Naval Air Station Quonset Point, Rhode Island, Whitcomb was assigned to the staff of Naval Air Station Clinton, Oklahoma. He attained the rank of lieutenant commander, and after his discharge he resumed practicing law in Springfield. From 1947 to 1948 he served as executive clerk to Governor Ernest W. Gibson Jr. In addition, he served as judge of Windsor's municipal court from 1947 to 1949. U.S. Attorney The 1952 presidential election victory of Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower gave him the opportunity to appoint Republicans to federal posts including United States Attorney following 16 years of Democratic administrations led by Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman. In October 1953, Eisenhower nominated Whitcomb to succeed Joseph A. McNamara as U.S. Attorney for the District of Vermont; Whitcomb had been jointly recommended by Vermont's U.S. Senators, George Aiken and Ralph Flanders. Whitcomb continued to serve until 1961, when the newly-elected Democratic president, John F. Kennedy, nominated Democrat Joseph F. Radigan to succeed Whitcomb.

The barge, a gold dredge, is owned by Tagiuk Gold, which previously ran scuba-diver-operated suction dredges for seafloor gold mining in the area. Tagiuk Gold is run by miner Andrew Lee, whose business running the barge is partially crowdfunded. Tagiuk Provider was profiled in an episode of Bering Sea Gold, at which time, it was the largest scoop dredge operating off Nome.

In the local I√±upiaq, it means the sea. History The barge was built in 1982 at Gunderson Bros. shipyard of Portland, Oregon, USA. It was built for arctic port resupply, and was to have been pushed by two ocean-going tugs for that duty. =Arctic Endeavor (1982-2016)= The Arctic Endeavor was fitted out for resupply of offshore oil rigs off the coast of the North Slope of Alaska in the Beaufort Sea by FMC Corporation and completed in 1983, for Crowley Maritime Corporation. It would also be used to clear lanes of ice for access to those rigs. The barge was operated with a pair of Point-class 2100 horsepower tugboats, out of Prudhoe Bay, by Crowley Maritime. The Arctic Endeavor was built as part of an order for 5 barges. In 1999, the barge was converted to ice-strengthened A1 classification, for operations as an oil response barge in the Beaufort Sea by Duwamish Shipyard. For the 2007 open-sea drilling season, Arctic Endeavor, functioning as a support barge, was part of the Royal Dutch Shell exploratory fleet for the Beaufort Sea. For the 2012 open-sea drilling season, Arctic Endeavor, functioning as an oil spill response barge, operated with the tug Point Oliktok, also working as an oil spill response ship, in the Royal Dutch Shell exploratory fleet for the Beaufort Sea, and homeported out of Nome. For the 2014 open-sea drilling season, Arctic Endeavor, functioning as an oil spill response barge, operated with the tug Point Oliktok, also working as an oil spill response ship, in the Royal Dutch Shell exploratory fleet for the Chukchi Sea and based out of Dutch Harbor. For the 2015 open-sea drilling season, Arctic Endeavor, functioning as an oil spill response barge, operated with the tug Sea Prince, also working as an oil spill response ship, in the Royal Dutch Shell exploratory fleet for the Chukchi Sea. =Tagiuk Provider (2016)= In 2016, the barge, then called Arctic Endeavour was sold to Tagiuk Gold by Crowley Marine Services in Seattle, Washington, USA; and renamed to Tagiuk Provider. It was moved to Olympia, Washington, USA, for refitting. As of 2018, it became the largest scooping barge mining ship operating off Nome, exceeding the size of the prior largest, the Myrtle Irene. The barge overwintered in the ice at the Port of Nome for the 2018-2019 winter sea ice season.

Mimetic Paradoxes is a 2018 book about sacrifice by Paolo Diego Bubbio, in which the author examines Rene Girard‚Äôs mimetic theory. This book collects Bubbio's most significant writings on the topic, and is presented as his intellectual journey over two decades (from 1999 to 2019) through mimetic theory. Content The first part is a revised translation of a short book originally published in Italian in 1999: the central thesis here is that philosophy and religion can be regarded as subjects involved in a mimetic rivalry on the intellectual level. In the chapters of the second part of the book, Bubbio addresses several topics developing the dialogue between Girard‚Äôs mimetic theory and the Post-Kantian philosophical tradition, and in particular contemporary philosophical hermeneutics. In the final chapter, Bubbio advocates for the need of developing mimetic theory into Hermeneutic Mimetic Theory (or HMT). According to Bubbio, HMT can solve some of the internal problems of mimetic theory in its original version, and at the same time it can offer a meaningful contribution to the development of a new paradigm of the ‚ÄúI‚Äù.Bubbio, Intellectual Sacrifice and Other Mimetic Paradoxes, p. ix See also *Sacrifice in the Post-Kantian Tradition  References   External links  * Intellectual Sacrifice and Other Mimetic Paradoxes Category:2018 non-fiction books Category:Books about sacrifice Category:Continental philosophy literature Category:English-language books Category:Philosophy books Category:Michigan State University Press books Category:Books by Diego Bubbio ","title":"Intellectual Sacrifice and Other Mimetic Paradoxes"},{"id":"62259763","text":"The Little Cut, also known as the Rain Hall Rock Branch or the Rain Hall Rock Canal, was a short canal connecting the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Barnoldswick to the nearby Rain Hall Rock limestone quarry. The canal ran north-east for through farmland and a deep cutting‚Äîincluding two tunnels‚Äîbefore terminating in a small basin.  Canal  The cut was constructed in 1796, around the time of the second phase of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. Built to serve a limestone quarry known as Rain Hall Rock, the cut left the main canal beneath a small bridge carrying the towing path, approximately south of Long Ing Bridge. The short length of the canal led to it being named locally as the \\"Little Cut\\", although it was formally known as the Rain Hall Rock Canal or Rain Hall Rock Branch. A tunnel was bored through the limestone near Higher Barnsay Farm, before a northwards bend took the canal through a deep cutting; this was the start of the quarry and the original canal terminus, from its junction with the main line. This tunnel was the only tunnel on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal to carry the towpath as well as the waterway. From the canal's junction with the main line, the towpath ran along the south side of the channel. Upon reaching the second tunnel, a turnover bridge moved the towpath to the north side of the canal. Permission to extend the quarry was granted in 1826 and the canal was extended through a second tunnel. A further extension had been made by 1862, when a viaduct was built (as an accommodation bridge) across the cut. Rather than building a large wharf or dock, limestone was loaded directly from the quarry into waiting barges in a widened basin. The quarry closed around the end of the First World War, and later the cut was used by Lancashire County Council for landfill. Only the central cutting‚Äîbetween the two tunnels‚Äîas well as parts of the tunnels are extant. Quarry Rock from the quarry has been classified by the British Geological Survey as nodular micaceous sandy limestone, with some specimens containing forams.

It employs circa 2,500 officers. The agency is headed by police chief (German: Polizeipr√§sident) Lutz M√ºller; the political head is the Senator for the Interior Ulrich M√§urer. The Bremen Police consists of three main bureaus: the central police directorate for personnel, education and logistics (Zentrale Polizeidirektion); the bureau of operations (Direktion Einsatz), comprising three patrol divisions Schutzpolizei, the riot police division readiness police, the traffic police division, and the water police division; and the detectives bureau (Direktion Kriminalpolizei/Landeskriminalamt).Senator f√ºr Inneres: Innensenator M√§urer ordnet die Polizei neu. Pressemitteilung vom 28. Juli 2016. History Bereitschaftspolizei Bremen is interacting after a Werder Bremen match, 2015 Polizeihaus, Bremen SS Bremen, 1928 International Police Exhibition Hannover 1966: Bremen police presented a traffic accident Readiness boat ‚ÄûBremen 1‚Äú for Wasserschutzpolizei and firebrigarde Bremen The Bremen Police was under the command of a police-commission of the Senat of Bremen headed by after major Karl Deichmann (MSPD) (1919‚Äì1920), after World War I. Later policing was headed by Senator Albert von Spreckelsen (DVP) (1920‚Äì1928, 1931‚Äì1933) and Senator Deichmann (1928‚Äì1931) again. Up from 1919 the office of a president of the police was installed and till 1933 the conservative Leopold Petri hold this position. In Nazi Germany, policing in Bremen was headed by SS or NSDAP members, but the commander of police was still the mayor of Bremen. The police consisted of a small Schutzpolizei (regular police), a large number of so- called \\"Luftschutzpolizei\\" (Air Raid Precautions police), a city corps and about 700 plant protection police officers. The Bremen Police was formed after World War II as the law enforcement agency for the state of Bremen. In 1947, a state criminal investigation office (Landeskriminalamt, LKA) was founded, which closely worked alongside the criminal police of the British element of the Control Commission for Germany and later with the related office in Lower Saxony. In 1974, the Landeskriminalamt was made an independent agency and in 2000, it was once again made part of the state police criminal investigation office. A remarkable date of Bremen police history after WWII was May 6, 1980. On this day the ceremonial oath of the Bundeswehr for recruits took place in Bremen Weserstadion. It was the first vow since the existence of the Bundeswehr and a major public event outside the barracks. Protests by various groups resulted in massive violent riots that culminated in the biggest street riots in the history of the city of Bremen. 257 police officers and more than 500 people involved in the protests were wounded. In 2014 the political head of Bremen State Police Ulrich M√§urer (SPD) started an initiative to charge German Football Association (DFB) for the extra coasts of the massive police present at so called \\"high-risc-matches\\" (Hochriskospiele), which was paid until than by public money from taxes. Deutsche Fu√üball-Liga (DFL) denied this and it went to court. The traditional police headquarters is the Polizeihaus Am Wall in the city centre, which had housed the Bremen police from 1908 until 1999. Today, the inner-city police office is housed there whilst the police headquarters is now in Bremen-Vahr. Riot police and the police academy is based in the Hindenburg-barracks in Bremen-Neustadt. Organization The Bremen State Police consists of three main divisions; the central police directorate for personnel, education and logistics (Zentrale Polizeidirektion); the operational directorate for traffic and water police, Schutzpolizei, the readiness police (Direktion Einsatz) and criminal investigation unit (Direktion Kriminalpolizei/Landeskriminalamt). Part of Bereitschaftspolizei Bremen is a Police dog unit (Hundestaffel Bremen). The weaponry bomb disposal unit (Kampfmittelr√§umdienst Bremen) is also a division of Bremen Police. The State Police is also cooperating with federal agencies: at the airport and the main station of Bremen with federal police and in custom related cases with the local Hauptzollamt Bremen and Zollfahndungsamt Hamburg. Police officers are organized in both police unions, Deutsche Polizeigwerkschaft (DPolG) and Gewerkschaft der Polizei (GdP). =Education= Officers at Bremen Poice are educated by a three-year study in policing at Hochschule f√ºr √ñffentliche Verwaltung Bremen, graduating with a Bachelor of Art. At the basic study the officers are trained in knowledge about society science, traffic-science and transport-law, psychology, law, administration and tactics, criminalistic and policing. Also they are trained in a foreign language. During the entire study, sport, shooting and self-defence are integrated in the education at a regular base, as well as practical training in police service. Police Bremen ran a training-police-station only for education at the barracks of readiness police. There novices train tactical behaviour and operational skills in role plays. Officers of Naval police have to have maritime additional qualification, trained by Wasserschutzpolizeischule in Hamburg. =Naval division= The Bremen Police has a naval division - the Wasserschutzpolizei Bremen (\\"Water Police Force\\"), WSP. Wasserschutzpolizei Bremen is part of Direktion Einsatz and is responsible for the water police tasks and naval police enforcement on the river of Weser. Local offices are located in the port of Doventor (Bremen) and the container terminal (Bremerhaven). The tasks of the WSP include operational and patrol duties, crime prevention, dangerous goods transport monitoring, environmental protection, maritime safety and prevention and contact service in recreational shipping. Until 2011, WSP Bremen was also responsible for the police control of international traffic in the seaports of Bremen and Bremerhaven until those responsibilities were handed over to the Federal Police at the instigation of the police leadership. = Equipment= The Bremen police is equipped with cars of different brands; Radiness police uses Mercedes Benz vans for operations. Radiness police provides two water canon trucks WaWe 10 from Rosenbauer-Mercedes Benz. Officers carry their duty handgun Walther P99 and additional tools, such as handcuffs, pepperspray, a flashlight and a tonfa. Heckler & Koch MP5 machine pistols are used additional at high risk operations. In 2017 Hamburg Police and Bremen Police ordered Heckler & Koch G36 assault rifle for their special-units.

The mural depicts 22 biblical scenes and characters while also incorporating people living at the hostel at that time.  Background  In 1958 the superintendent of St Mary's Hostel, Captain Colin Steep, was driving back to the hostel when he passed Czak√≥ painting the local scenery, including Pitchi Richi Sanctuary, and was very impressed with him as a painter and also for his likeable demeanour. Steep invited him home for tea and, ultimately, asked him to stay and allowed him to set up a studio in one of the sheds. The children at St. Mary's found his name difficult to pronounce and the nicknamed him \\"Mr Charcoal\\". Following prayers in the chapel one evening Czak√≥ was very excited and said that he had visualised a large mural for the space and said that he would paint in, free of charge, if his supplies were provided. After the wall was prepared Czak√≥ spent a few weeks panning and then only six weeks to paint the mural in full. A picture of the mural is available on Territory Stories.  The Mural  The mural depicts 22 scenes: # The nativity scene # Jesus in the temple # Gethsemane # Pilate washes his hands # The soldiers put a scarlet robe on Jesus # Christ carrying the cross # The angel at the tomb # The Ascension # Pentecost # St. John writing with a quill # The four beasts behind John # The Four Horsemen with their horses # Bodies and skeletons # [As Above] # The bottomless pit # The resurrection of bodies # St. Michael slaying the dragon # The woman ascending into heaven # Three Jewish prophets from The Old Testament # The seven saints, new testament and history #* St. John the Baptist #* St. George; patron saint of England #* St. Elizabeth of Hungary #* St. Joan of Arc; the maid of New Orleans #* St. Francis of Assisi; founder of the Franciscan order #* St. Patrick; the patron saint of Ireland #* St. Peter # The Church # The large group of people ; this scene is used by Czak√≥ to relate to the picture of the Pentecost where the Holy Spirit, in the form of a dove, came to the Virgin Mary and the 11 apostles and they begun to speak in different tongues and it shows people from around the world as well as more people from the hostel including: #* Captain Colin Steep; the superintendent who was depicted wearing an ordained ministers cassock (which he was not) and Czak√≥, correctly, said he would be one day. #* Norah Thompson; the cook at the hostel was depicted in a wheelchair with a guard dog in reference to her hating dogs. Again, strangely, Thompson would one day require a wheelchair. #* Ruth Richardson; Norah's sister who also worked at the hostel was depicted dressed as a barrister, which she had practised as earlier in her life (the sisters were both in their 70s and while on a holiday from England decided they would take jobs at the hostel). #* Robert Czak√≥; Czak√≥ depicted himself as an elderly blind man with a white beard. When asked why he painted himself this way he said that \\"he was unable to see the true value of things\\".

Organization  = College Athletics Office = The College Athletics Office, is a service bureau that supports Ateneo's college varsity teams through certificate issuance, class schedule management, accident insurance procurement, P.E. and NSTP exemptions and scholarship facilitation, varsity jackets sourcing, and team budget management. To do all this, the office works with various offices in the Loyola Schools such as the Registrar's Office and the Office of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs. They also coordinate with the Office of Admission and Aid and the University Athletics Office if necessary to help Ateneo's student athletes perform well in their academics. The College Athletics Office also works with student writers, the Ateneo Sports Shooters, and the Athletics Council (AC). Ateneo's athletes are able to air their concerns to the College Athletics Office through the AC. The athletics office in turn relays the concerns to the Loyola Schools administration for proper action. = Sports development program = In order for the Ateneo varsity teams to excel in sports on a sustained basis, the Ateneo University Athletics Office has implemented an integrated sports development program. It was formulated in the late 1990s to methodically develop sports talent in the Ateneo Grade School, High School, and the Loyola Schools (college). The program has a grassroots approach, building from the ground up. The same methods and principles are used in the Grade School, High School, and Loyola Schools sports programs. Several top players from the grade school and high school have already become successful in the college teams. Under the integrated sports development program, the University Athletics Office has identified several \\"priority sports.\\" Initially, these sports were chosen based on what the Ateneo already excelled in as well as available sports facilities. The goal was to expand the list of priority sports each year, with each sport under a program manager. To date, there are 14 programs, each for a UAAP sport: athletics, badminton, baseball/softball, basketball, cheerleading, chess, fencing, football, lawn tennis, table tennis, judo, taekwondo, swimming, and volleyball (indoor and beach). Under the basketball and the football programs are the Ateneo Basketball School and the Ateneo Football Center, which give regular basketball and football clinics to students. The plan is to open centers for the other programs as well. In 2013, clinics for volleyball were held, as a step towards opening a volleyball center. One measure of their success is that other schools are opening similar centers. The main objective of this sports program is to have a better overall standing in the UAAP general championship. Ateneo has not won a General Championship in the seniors division since it joined the UAAP in 1978. In UAAP Season 75 (2012‚Äì13), Ateneo finished third place in the seniors division General Championship. It was the highest standing for Ateneo so far.  Facilities  The sports-loving American Jesuits who took over the administration of the Ateneo de Manila in 1912 and taught at the Ateneo in the 1900s left a legacy in sports to the school. Unlike other schools, Ateneo in the early and mid-1900s, was fortunate to have educators who were former athletes. The American Jesuits were former basketball, baseball and soccer players as well as track and field athletes. They provided the fundamentals of these sports to their students as coaches of the varsity teams. They preached to them the Greek ideal \\"mens sana in corpore sano\\" which translates to \\"a sound mind in a sound body.\\" Since sports is an important part of the Ateneo educational system, the Jesuits give importance to the construction of sports facilities. The first building to be built when Ateneo moved its main campus to Loyola Heights from Pade Faura was the Blue Eagle gym. Since then, Ateneo with the generous financial support of wealthy alumni in some projects has spent much in the construction of numerous sports facilities. Here are the various sport facilities found in the Ateneo Loyola Heights campus: link= Basketball * Blue Eagle Gym ‚Äì 1949 * Moro Lorenzo Sports Center ‚Äì 2001 * Loyola Schools (College) Covered Courts ‚Äì 1951 * High School Covered Courts ‚Äì 1956 * Grade School Covered Courts ‚Äì 1995 link= Football * Moro Lorenzo Football Field ‚Äì 2012 * Ed Ocampo Football Field * High School Football Field No.1 * High School Football Field No.2 link= Volleyball * Blue Eagle Gym ‚Äì 1949 * Loyola Schools (College) Covered Courts ‚Äì 1951 * High School Covered Courts link= Beach Volleyball * Loyola Schools Sand Court ‚Äì 2014 link= Softball * Loyola Schools Softball Field link= Handball * Loyola Schools Handball Court link= Track and Field * Loyola Schools Synthetic Track Oval (Olympic-standard with 8 lanes) * Moro Lorenzo Sports Center Indoor Track Oval ‚Äì 2001 * High School Dirt Track Oval link= Chess * Blue Eagle Gym ‚Äì 1949 link= Badminton * Moro Lorenzo Sports Center Badminton Courts ‚Äì 2001 link= Lawn Tennis * Loyola Schools Tennis Courts link= Table Tennis * Blue Eagle Gym ‚Äì 1949 * Loyola Schools P.E.

The Ateneo gym has a seating capacity of 7,500. School gyms in the 1940s were small because their primary purpose was as a practice facility for the school's varsity basketball team and a place for student convocations as a secondary usage. Fr. William F. Masterson, S.J., then the Ateneo Rector had a different concept in mind. He wanted more usage for the gym he envisioned, one that is designed to be revenue generating and home to various varsity teams. Specifically, it was to be an alternate venue to the Rizal Memorial Coliseum for the National Collegiate Athletic Association games. Thus the gym that was constructed stands 213 feet wide and 281 feet long (or 60,863 square feet) and cost Php 650,000.00 to construct. The gym is not only the home of the Blue Eagles and Lady Eagles (college varsity basketball teams) but also of the college baseball, chess, fencing, judo, table tennis and volleyball varsity teams. It is the practice facility of these varsity teams. There is a baseball batting cage, a chess room, a fencing strip and a judo training area. The basketball court is converted to a volleyball court when the volleyball varsity teams practice. The Blue Babble Battalion and band use the gym for their practice. It is also used by the University community for big gatherings. The gym houses the University Athletics Office, a sports library, a study hall, a small air-conditioned dormitory and an exhibit room for the multi-titled Ateneo Blue Eagle Coach Baby Dalupan. There is also a room for trophies, awards and sports memorabilia. Locker and shower rooms are available for the players. The gym was inaugurated on December 3, 1949, and has undergone several name changes since its opening. At its christening in 1949, it was called the Ateneo Gym. In the late 1960s until the mid-1970s, the gym was leased to Emerito Ramos, Sr., an alumnus (HS '25) and was renamed the Loyola Center. With this change in management, the gym was used not only as practice facility of the school's varsity basketball teams and for NCAA basketball games but also as an entertainment venue. Musical concerts were held. Shows of local and American rock-n-roll singer artists were presented at the gym, making it a veritable mini- Araneta Coliseum. The name Loyola Center stuck even after management was reverted to the school when the lease contract expired. It was in the year 2000, when the gym was undergoing renovation, that it got its present name, the Blue Eagle Gym. The Ateneo Blue Eagle gym is a landmark due to the large blue eagle emblem mounted on the facade that can be easily seen from the main public road (Katipunan Avenue) along the front of the school campus. The Moro Lorenzo Sports Center The Moro Lorenzo Sports Center is a sports complex built in the Loyola Heights campus to bolster the sports program of Ateneo. Construction of the sports center was started on November 11, 2000, and was fully completed in 2001. It was inaugurated on March 17, 2001, and named after one of Ateneo's basketball players, Luis \\"Moro\\" Lorenzo, who played for the Blue Eagles in the 1940s. The sports complex offers facilities such as an indoor basketball court where the university's varsity basketball teams hold their practice, indoor badminton and volleyball courts, indoor track oval measuring approximately 200 meters, a weights room and a fully air-conditioned sports medical clinic. Other facilities include an audio-visual room, locker rooms and Prayer Room. The Moro Lorenzo Football Field A new 40 million-peso football field was constructed at the Ateneo Loyola campus grounds. Construction started on August 22, 2011, and was finished in December 2012, in time for the opening of the UAAP football season 75. The University Athletics Office (UAO) and the Luis \\"Moro\\" Lorenzo family, as sponsor, have partnered to transform the present Erenchun Football Field into a world-class football pitch which was officially named the Moro Lorenzo Football Field. This football field meets international and Olympic standards. According to the standards set by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), the minimum acceptable size for a football field is 90 by 45 meters, while the maximum size is set at 120 by 90 meters. Based on these prescribed sizes, the Moro Lorenzo Football Field which is 110 by 70 meter pitch meets world-class standards. The pitch is an all-weather field composed of first-generation Princess 77 Bermuda grass imported from Thailand because later-generation grass tends to discolor as it is of lower quality. The Princess 77 is a low maintenance variant similar to those used in golf courses in Hawaii. A grass nursery was built nearby which is being used to plant more Bermuda grass to be used for replacing dead spots on the pitch over time. The pitch has drainage and sprinkler systems similar to golf courses to maintain the conditions of the field. The University Athletics Office stressed that it is the first field of its kind in Ateneo so it has to be of high quality. The UAO has also been working with the United States-based Trans-Lux Corporation for an outdoor weatherproof 5 by 4 meter electronic scoreboard with LED lights for the football games. According to the UAO, this will be the first scoreboard of its kind in the Philippines. Floodlights were installed over the renovated field so that football games can be held at night. The Loyola Schools Blue Track Oval A new track oval has been built around the Moro Lorenzo football field. Both sports facilities are situated on the same place where the old cinder track oval and Erenchun Football Field were located. Work started in late 2011 and finished in May 2013. It is 400 meters long with eight lanes. The oval meets the standards set by the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF) which stipulates that an Olympic-standard race track be at least 400 meters long and have at least four lanes. The actual oval features the Herculean Spike Resistant Sprint system imported from the Netherlands that cost roughly P19 million, a variant that is accepted by the IAAF. It is water impermeable and spike resistant. The oval is colored royal blue. The track oval will be used primarily by the Track and Field varsity teams which are presently training off-campus. Other Ateneo varsity teams will also be using the track oval for their training activities which require running. It may also become a venue for UAAP Track and Field tournaments in the future. The Loyola Schools Sand Court A new beach volleyball sand court has been built near the Moro Lorenzo football field. The court was opened for use last May 2014. It is not a regular court but a makeshift type, good enough for practice purposes. It is being used by the Beach Volleyball varsity teams so that they do not have to go off-campus for practice. The Loyola Schools Swimming Pool The Loyola Schools swimming pool is a state-of-the-art short-course pool used for PE swimming classes and by the varsity swimming teams for training and dual meets. It is a 25-meter, 8-lane, roofed and no-wave swimming pool and complemented by a bleachers section for 250 spectators and outside showers. A Php5 million donation from a former member of the Ateneo varsity swimming team, alumnus Cecilio Pedro, BS '75, helped cover part of the Php15 million cost of the sports facility that Ateneo never had since joining the NCAA and UAAP in 1924 and 1978, respectively. Construction was completed on June 28, 2006. The blessing and inauguration was held on July 15, 2006.Blue tide rising The Loyola Schools Physical Education Dept. Sports Complex The Loyola Schools P.E. Dept. sports complex consists of the College Covered (basketball) Courts, two lawn tennis courts, table tennis courts, dancing hall, martial arts gym, a bodybuilding gym, dressing and shower rooms, a half- Olympic swimming pool that is used by both P.E. swimming classes and the varsity swimming teams for training and dual meets and a shooting range used by the rifle and pistol varsity team, the first of its kind in the Philippines. Also in the same complex are the College Athletics office and the offices of the physical education department and a cafeteria. The Loyola Schools Covered Courts The Loyola Schools (College) Covered Courts is a sports facility which is part of the Loyola Schools Physical Education Department sports complex. It consists of eight regulation-sized basketball courts which have concrete floors that can be converted to a futsal court and/or volleyball courts. It also has dressing and shower rooms. It was opened for student-use in 1951.

It was designed by William Butterfield and constructed in 1863‚Äì64. The church has been a Grade II listed building since 1987. History Christ Church was built to serve the scattered parts of the parish of Lyndhurst, including the hamlets of Emery Down and Bank. Although the parish church, St Michael and All Angels, had opened shortly beforehand, replacing an earlier church, it was considered unable to comfortably accommodate the entire congregation, and was also criticised for being drafty and cold. As a resident of Emery Down, Admiral Frederick Moore Boultbee was aware of the need for a church and had Christ Church constructed at his sole expense. The church cost an approximate ¬£1,300 to build and the Admiral also provided an endowment of ¬£1,700. The plans for the church were drawn up by William Butterfield of London and Messrs. Hillary of Andover hired as the builders. Construction began in mid-1863 and the church was consecrated by the Bishop of Winchester, the Right Rev. Charles Sumner, on 26 May 1864. With the church's completion, Emery Down was formed as a separate ecclesiastical parish from Lyndhurst. Architecture Christ Church is built of local brick with Bath stone dressings and a tiled roof. Red brick is predominately used, with some diapering using blue brick. Designed to accommodate 165 persons, the church is made up of a nave, chancel, organ chamber, vestry and north-west porch. There is a bellcote containing a single bell at the west end. The floor of the nave is laid with red and black squared tiles, and the chancel laid with encaustic tiles from Mintons. Fittings include the pews of stained deal, the lectern and altar table of oak, and the pulpit, which is placed on a pedestal of Bath stone. A wall tablet was installed in the church in 1915 in memory of Admiral Boultbee, who died in 1876.

In 1954, she was the head of the Baath party women's division in the Palestinian territories. In the aftermath of the Six Day War in 1967 and the occupation of the Gaza Strip, she fled Gaza and settled in Beirut. She was the secretary general of the Palestinian Liberation Organization's (PLO) Women's Union from 1976 to 1986, and a member of the Palestine National Council (PNC). The General Union of Palestinian Women was itself formed in 1965 as a result of a PNC decision in 1964. Known for her strong anti-Zionist views, she stated the goal of Palestinians is the liberation of Palestine and that \\"any Palestinian who wanted less was a traitor\\" Within the Palestinian community, she is an outspoken advocate for women's rights especially politically, calling for greater inclusion of women in the Palestine National Council and policy- making. Sayegh believed the segregation of men and women as a form of discrimination as it prioritized the male component of the movement. In 1968, she took a stand against Fatah's policy of men leading women based purely on their gender and eventually lead to gender equality at grassroot levels. Her bold approach to empowering women has attracted criticism, with one commentator in 1988 stating \\"she shouts too much\\". She was a speaker at the 1980 United Nations Women's Conference in Copenhagen where she received \\"thunderous applause\\" for her speech on promoting peace, equality and development. She stated that the results of the conference was a success not only for Palestinians but \\"for all peoples fighting against racism, exploitation and foreign rule\\". Sayegh has also written poems about the struggles faced by women in the Palestinian refugee camps. Her poems have been published in prominent Arab magazines across the region such as the Al-Adab magazine in Lebanon, Aqlam magazine in Iraq. She has also participated in poetry festivals across the Arab World including in Beirut, Baghdad, Kuwait City, Oman and Cairo. She is married to Abu Hatam, a PLO official. They have 4 children. Recognition Sayegh received the Ana Betancourt award in the 1980s from the Cuban president Fidel Castro. She is also the subject of a 2001 documentary film Stories from Gaza () produced by Mer‚Äôah Media and directed by Lebanese filmmaker Arab Loutfi.

Early life  Heath is the daughter of John and Susan Heath and was born in Fremantle, Western Australia and she attended school at St. Joeseph's Convent before moving, in 1914, to the East Fremantle State School. Heath joined the Australian Board of Missions as a teenager and, ultimately, deciding to become a deaconess. She trained at Deaconess House and was ordained in 1938. Before coming to the Northern Territory, where Heath spent most of her career, she worked at the Moore River Native Settlement between 1935 - 1944. She was disgusted by conditions there where many Aboriginal people were forced to live and 'half-caste' children, and often their mothers, were forced to live in overcrowded and insufficient conditions. In 1935 the settlement was \\"at crisis point\\" and, despite the compound being designed for 200 people, had 300 people living there (mostly children) and the area surrounding it was surrounded by people living in tin, bag and brush humpies: The Great Depression was hitting hard. After 9 years working at the settlement she was fired for, very publicly, criticising the way that it was run and the poor conditions.  Life in the Northern Territory  Heath moved the Alice Springs to Work at St. Mary's Hostel, where she was the first superintendent, in 1946 alongside her friend Lillian Schroder who would serve as the housekeeper and seamstress. They welcomed their first residents on 2 March 1946, four children (two girls and two boys) from Newcastle Waters Station and from there the numbers continued to grow. Eight months later there were 18 children and this number continued to grow to a peak of 71 in 1955. It is said that Heath took a very active interest in the children and that they lived a relaxed and carefree existence; playing sport, climbing trees and riding donkeys. Heath also encouraged the children to be involved in community events including the Children's Fancy Dress Ball and Guy Fawkes Night. Heath left the hostel in 1955, after 10 years of service, when she started working for the Welfare Branch in Alice Springs where she was employed as a field welfare officer. From 1970 -1975 she returned to St. Mary's, which became St Mary's Children's Village in 1972, as a social worker. Throughout her time in the Northern Territory she was also an active member if the local Girl Guides Association and helped establish a number of packs.  Later life  Heath retired to live in Western Australia in 1992 and passed away on 22 October 2011; a month before her 106th birthday. Heath Road (registered 17 July 1981), on the southern boundary of St. Mary's Hostel in named for Heath.

These iron crystals are more dense than the surrounding liquid, and fall back towards the planet's inner core where they remelt under pressure and combine with other elements. Here, the melting point of the iron is reduced by the presence of sulfur, and the newly-mixed sulfur and iron compounds begin to float back up towards the outer core, . Iron and sulfur which do not precipitate out will tend to be lighter than the surrounding material and are believed to collect into a solid layer at the core/ mantle boundary sometimes referred to as an anticrust.

It is in and was the origin of the name of Baden in Switzerland. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. History The hot springs, located at a bend in the Limmat river near the legion camp at Vindonissa (today Windisch), were discovered around 20 AD. The hot (), mineral rich water was prized by the Romans and a settlement quickly developed around the springs. By the middle of the 1st century a good sized settlement surrounded the mineral baths. In 69 AD, during the Year of the Four Emperors, the XXI Legion burned the wooden vicus or settlement to the ground. Aquae Helveticae was rebuilt in stone in the following years. When the legion abandoned Vindonissa in 101, the local economy shrank. However, by the second half of the 2nd century the settlement experienced another golden age. During this time, pottery and bronze from Aquae Helveticae were traded throughout the region. During the 3rd century a series of invasions by the Alemanni led to the settlement being abandoned. However, the baths continued to operate. In the 4th century a defensive wall was built around the baths and coins continued to be minted in Aquae Helveticae. The mineral springs probably continued to be used in the Early Middle Ages though no written records remain. 7th century graveyards have been discovered at Kappelerhof and L√§ndli located west and south respectively of the baths, indicating that the area remained occupied. Some of the baths remained in operation from the 4th/5th century until the 9th century. According to archaeological evidence in the 11th century some of the Roman-era baths were repaired and returned to operation. By the 13th or 14th centuries the baths were rebuilt and reappear in the historical record. But by that time the Roman Aquae Helveticae was replaced with Germanic Baden. Site layout The main road through the vicus was the army road leading to Vindonissa. This road was flanked with shops and residential buildings with large arcades or porticos providing shoppers with protection from the weather and heat. Behind the shops were living quarters and then courtyards with outbuildings and workshops. The center of the settlement had several villas. The ruins of three baths have been discovered, though others may have existed. Excavation Much of the settlement of Aquae Helveticae is located under the town of Baden, making exploration difficult. In 2018 during demolition of the Staadhof Hotel workers discovered 2000 year old wooden beams which supported the baths. Cantonal archaeology then excavated and discovered a large floor, a long wall and a drain that may have fed other pools. In 2020, a well-preserved Roman bath was discovered in Baden, dates back to 2,000 years ago.

The PreonVM was initially developed to run on the Atmel AVR ATmega256, but has been ported to ARM Cortex-M3 systems. Therefore the VM can run on a microcontroller with 8 kB RAM and 256 kB ROM at a minimum. The PreonVM requires no additional operating system and runs directly on the microcontroller. Every class file of the application is transformed via a ClassLinker to strip all parts of class files that is not required. This makes it possible to reduce the class file size by about 80%, which is required for a small device. The ClassLinker builds a .vmm file which combines all application class files in a special format which can be read and executed by the PreonVM on the microcontroller. The VM supports all Java data types incl. long and double, threads, synchronization, Garbage collection with memory defragmentation, exceptions, system properties and IRQ/event system.

He descended from the barons von Bussnang from the Canton of Thurgau. He is first mentioned in records as provost in 1221.  Works  Konrad was elected the new abbot by the conventuals of Saint Gall immediately after they had received the news of Abbot Rudolf von G√ºttingen's death (1226 in Rome). The rapid electoral procedure should prevent the interference of the ministeriales. Abbot Konrad had his election confirmed by King Henry VII in √úberlingen. He purchased the lien for the monastery's bailiwick for 600 mark, whereby he wanted to prevent Count Hartmann von Kyburg's buying parts of it. He concentrated his duties on reducing the debt from his predecessor's, Rudolf von G√ºttingen's, reign. By means of an enforced additional tax, he was able to satisfy the creditors, a consortium of Italian merchants. Being a loyal supporter of the Staufer family, Konrad became one of the most important advisers to King Henry VII after 1228, who, in thanks, gave him a farm near Kriessern. The bonds of loyalty were broken when Henry VII challenged Emperor Frederick II. Henceforth, Abbot Konrad belonged to the party that was loyal to the emperor. As a reward, the emperor supported Konrad's ambitions as heir of Friedrich von Toggenburg. Since the latter had been killed by his brother Diethelm II von Toggenburg, his parents transferred the property of Toggenburg and the city of Wil to the Abbot of Saint Gall. A conflict ensued about the heritage of Toggenburg that lasted for years and was finally, in 1236, decided by Emperor Frederick II in favour of the abbot . Konrad von Bussnang maintained a costly household that, together with his war against Count Diethelm II von Toggenburg, devoured a considerable amount of money. He collected the necessary means from his subjects. When a number of Saint Gall's discontented citizens wanted to unite with the people from Appenzell, he had the houses of fifteen citizens torn down. Due to this uncompromising tax policy and his skilful acquisition policy, which was legally secured by a papal document on 5 May 1234, the abbey was free from debt at the end of his reign. Abbot Konrad died on 20 December 1239 and was entombed in Salem Abbey.

Plot introduction Martinique, 1765, and brothers Emile and Lucien are charged by their French master, Father Cleophas, with a mission. They must return to Grenada, the island they once called home, and smuggle back the 42 slaves claimed by English invaders at the hospital plantation in Fort Royal. While Lucien, barely in his teens, sees the trip as a great adventure, the older and worldlier Emile has no illusions about the dangers they will face.

As of 2019, he is a cartoonist for the Lansing Journal. Early life and education Jim Siergey has said that he was \\"brought up to be a polite boy\\" and that \\"music, writing, drawing, wordplay and humor were as much of a pastime while growing up as any physical activity.\\" He grew up reading MAD comics by Harvey Kurtzman, Will Elder and Jack Davis (cartoonist). Siergey has stated that he has been drawing since he \\"could hold a pencil, for as long as I can remember\\". He attended Columbia College and began to draw \\"comix\\" in the 1970s. In his twenties, Siergey met Jay Lynch, a trailblazer of underground comix, which he describes as a turning point in his life. Lynch introduced him to Berkley cartoonist Clay Geerdes, who is considered the godfather of the mini-comix movement. Career In the early 1980s, Siergey started his career as a freelance cartoonist and animator, working on commercials as well as educational and industrial films, which he continued into the 1990s. In the 1990s, he created the comic strip 'Cultural Jetlag' together with late writer Tom Roberts, which appeared in many alternative press publications, before TIME (magazine) and USA Weekend carried it from 1997‚Äì2001.

The most commonly cited central pillar of MƒÅori identity is whakapapa (genealogy), which in its most literal sense requires blood-ancestry to MƒÅori people. Overview Witi Ihimaera, the first published Maori novelist, has described its connection as follows: \\"For many Maori, the key to their cultural or ethnic identity as Maori lies in whakapapa, that mystical element that forever links Maori, through their tipuna, to this land\\". Alternatively, Peeni Henare has criticised blood quantum factors in relation to MƒÅori identity, suggesting it is an attack on the identity of urban MƒÅori and non-MƒÅori-speakers. Colloquially, Taha MƒÅori (the MƒÅori perspective) is used closely in association with the identity of MƒÅori people. MƒÅori identity can be defined independently of religious identity; MƒÅori are a diverse group in terms of religious affiliations, including MƒÅori Christians and MƒÅori Muslims, as well as followers of the traditional MƒÅori belief system. In MƒÅori mythology, the indigenous faith carried largely unchanged to Aotearoa from the tropical Eastern Polynesian homeland Hawaiki Nui. Tangihanga (mourning ceremonies) or native funeral rituals, as well as tangata whenua (people of the land) are both strongly linked with the concept of MƒÅori identity. Local government in the Auckland Region actively promotes its growth, stating that \\"Using MƒÅori names for roads, buildings and other public places is an opportunity to publicly demonstrate MƒÅori identity\\". Auckland Council have also stated that both kaumƒÅtua and kuia (male and female tribal elders) are crucial to the \\"matauranga and tikanga that underpins MƒÅori identity\\". Categories MƒÅori identity can be described as consisting of interconnected parts, some or all of which may constitute an individual's self-identification: #MƒÅori peoplehood, an Polynesian indigenous ethnic identity, identified most readily via whakapapa #MƒÅori religion, the observance or recognition of the MƒÅori belief system #MƒÅori culture, celebration of MƒÅoritanga and traditions Academic research Academic research examining MƒÅori cultural and racial identity has been conducted since the 1990s. The 1994 study by Mason Durie (Te Hoe Nuku Roa Framework: A Maori Identity Measure), Massey University's 2004 study of Maori cultural identity, and 2010's Multi-dimensional model of Maori identity and cultural engagement by Chris Sibley and Carla Houkamau have explored the concept in various ways. 2015's Perspectives towards MƒÅori identity by MƒÅori heritage language learners, conducted at Victoria University of Wellington, acknowledges that \\"MƒÅori identities continue to evolve and adapt as a result of social and environmental changes MƒÅori experience\\". In 2019, the University of Auckland conducted the MƒÅori Identity and Financial Attitudes Study2. Community work and investment Community work in New Zealand has identified males struggling with their MƒÅori identity, often also living by MƒÅori lunar calendar, as a significant suicide risk. In 2015, The Guardian covered a crisis of MƒÅori incarceration and identity in relation to the New Zealand prison system. Toby Manhire reported: > While those who identify as MƒÅori make up about 15% of the New Zealand > population, the corresponding figure behind bars is more than 50%. Among > women, for whom there is no Te Tirohanga option, it is higher still, at 60%. In 2019, The Northland Age reported on the merits of a noho-marae style of counselling to incarcerated MƒÅori, utilizing tikanga (traditional rules for conducting life) in a \\"course that uses MƒÅori philosophy, values, knowledge and practices to foster the regeneration of MƒÅori identity\\". In 2019, in a Radio New Zealand budget summary, the announcement of an NZ$80 million investment in WhƒÅnau Ora, including a MƒÅori suicide prevention initiative, \\"as well as eight programmes to strengthen MƒÅori identity\\".

References to this temple are found in Aithihyamala of Kottarathil Sankunni and many classics of Malayalam Literature. The place where the idol is worshiped in the temple resembles the addition of sand. Legend has it that the Shiva Linga was made by Agnihotri by using the sand from Bharathapuzha river. Anointing is not performed because it is a Shivling of sand. The Shivalinga sits slightly oblique, as the mother of Agnihotri held on to the force, there was a slight tilt.https://trithalamahasivakshethram.in/legend/ The temple is a part of the 108 famous Shiva temples in Kerala. According to historians, the Trithala Siva Temple, built in the 9th or 10th century, marks the transition from Chola to Pandya style architecture.  History Siva Temple Nalambalam Trithala Maha Siva temple, probably built during the 9th and 10th century, marks the transition from the Chola to the Pandya style of temple architecture. The Legend Vemancheri Mana of Agnihotri The legend of 'Parayi petta panthirukulam' is centered on Trithala. According to this legend, a Brahmin named Vararuchi, married a lower caste woman named Panchami. After the marriage, they set out on a long journey.http://www.namboothiri.com/articles/agnihothri.htm During the course of the journey, the Panchami became pregnant several times, and every time she delivered a baby, the husband asked her to leave it there itself. Each of the babies was taken up by people of different castes (totally 12), thus they grew up in that caste, making the legendary 'Panthirukulam'. They all became famous in their lives and many tales are attributed to them. The eldest was Brahmadathan Agnihothri, a Brahmin, whose place is Mezhathur in Trithala. The others are Pakkanar (Basket weaver), Rajaka (Laundry man), Karakkal Matha (The only female member), Akavur Chathan, Vaduthala Nair (Kshatriya/Warrior), Thiruvalluvar (Philosopher), Uppukuttan (a Muslim), Pananar (a Panar), (Perumthachan (Master carpenter), Naranathu Bhranthan (an eccentric but divine person), Vayillakunnilappan (a child without mouth, whom the mother wanted to keep with her). Their stories are mentioned in the well known book 'Eithihyamala' by Kottarathil Sankunni. According to legend, a boy from Vemancheri Mana named Agnihotri (first son of Vararuchi and Panchami) went to the river to bath with his mother. The boy took the sand and made a heap on the shore. When the mother tried to remove it, she found that it was hardened in the form of a Shiva linga. Thus, the famous Trithala siva temple that exists today was built. It is said that the river is said to have the altered course to make the sanctum sanatorium of the temple. It is mentioned about the temple and temple village in the chapter titled 'Pantheerukulam ()', of Aythihyamala written by Kottarathil Shankunni. Temple Architecture Trithala is an important archaeological place in Kerala. Trithala Siva is located on the southern bank of Bharathapuzha river, about 75 km from the Palakkad. The most striking feature of the temple is that it is still preserved as the oldest archaeological site in Kerala.

However, the election sparked controversy which was spread even to Rome. Pope Gregory IX eventually called upon the bishop of Como to investigate the election. Thanks in large parts to the support from Heinrich von Tanne of Constance, he was confirmed as abbot. In return, Walter of Trauchburg handed important papal and episcopal documents, which regulated the relationship between Saint Gall and Constance, over to the bishop of Constance.

Aquila Urbis, Walldorf 2018, S. 186ff. Instead, in a so-called free private city, a private company offers residents protection of life, liberty, and property in a demarcated area as \\"government service providers\\". This service includes security and rescue services, a legal and regulatory framework and independent dispute resolution. The residents pay a contractually fixed amount for these services per year. The public service provider as operator of the community can not unilaterally change the contract later. The so-called contract citizens have a legal claim that is respected and a claim for damages in case of poor performance by the private city. Disputes between them and the government service provider are brought before independent arbitration tribunals, as is customary in international commercial law. If the operator ignores the arbitration award or misuses its power in another way, its customers leave and the operator goes bankrupt. Gebel expressly refers to his concept as a means of coping with migration crises.

The canal was built by the 4th Duke of Marlborough to provide a link between the River Thames and Cassington Mill; it later provided alternative wharfage to that at Eynsham. The canal was in operation for less than 70 years, its use declining with the advent of rail transport. The canal's primary use was to connect the Duke's salt works with the network of canals, rivers, and other inland waterways, as well as connecting the Oxford Canal and the Thames and Severn Canal.  History  Built between 1800 and 1802, the canal initially provided an connection between Cassington Mill and the recently-constructed Cassington‚ÄìEynsham road. An early mention of the canal was in 1800, where the canal was described as \\"made by and belonging to\\" the Duke of Marlborough, and that its purpose was to convey goods between Cassington Mill and a wharf. A wide pool exists on the canal near Cassington Mill; this was possibly a basin which acted as the original terminus. Here, sluices and a weir between the cut and the River Evenlode were built. By 1802, the canal was extended to meet the River Thames. At this time, engineer Robert Mylne conducted a report for the Thames Commissioners, which described the canal's length as approximately , and its width as . He also documented a lock at the canal's junction with the Thames‚Äîpossibly a stop lock as the navigations were controlled by different bodies. The lock, which maintained the canal at above the Thames (the same height as the mill weir) was wide and long. Beyond the canal's navigational limit at Cassington Wharf, the channel continued as a feeder from the Evenlode. The Duke of Marlborough was a shareholder in the Oxford Canal and had recently provided access between the lower Oxford Canal and the Thames via the Duke's Cut. As a private canal‚Äîboth in terms of finance and land ownership‚Äîno Act of Parliament was needed to allow its construction. It was built as a broad canal, meaning vessels wider than ‚Äîthe standard maximum beam of a narrowboat‚Äîwere able to use it. Boats from the north were restricted by the lock sizes on the Oxford Canal, which only catered for narrow boats. The Duke leased the canal to the Oxford Canal Company. A public house, The Barge, was established at the wharf in 1804 by the first wharfinger, Henry Baker. Baker had previously been employed at Enslow on the Oxford Canal, and it is he after whom Baker's Lock (number 40) on the Oxford Canal was named. Baker constructed two lime kilns at the wharf. Although sources suggest that the canal was not complete until 1814, reports exist of through-traffic of coal barges from the wharf to the Thames that were in operation in 1808. The canal's primary use was to provide a connection between the Duke's estate (including the trade from his salt works) and the network of inland waterways including other canals and rivers. The canal was able to trade with the Warwickshire Coalfield via the Thames and the Oxford Canal, and the Somerset Coalfield via the Thames and thence the Thames and Severn, Wilts and Berks, Kennet and Avon Canal, and Somerset Coal Canals. Fierce competition between the Thames and Severn Canal Company (who had taken over ownership of the cut) and the Oxford Canal Company (who owned the Wharf Stream in Eynsham) meant that barges were not permitted to unload at Eynsham Wharf. The Oxford Canal Company reacted by taking over the lease of the canal in 1834 to quash competition of coal travelling to the area from Somerset. At this time, Cassington Wharf was taking approximately ¬£800 per year (). In 1839, Cassington Wharf was considered as a loading point for Taynton stone if it was to be used in the rebuilding of the Houses of Parliament. Charles Barry instead opted for Anston stone, much of which was loaded at Kiveton Park Wharf onto the Chesterfield Canal and taken from there to London via the North Sea. The Oxford Canal Company did not renew the lease on the canal after 1842, and it was taken over by John Hambridge. In the 1841 census, Hambridge was a 40-year-old coal merchant living at Cassington Wharf. He was still living at the wharf at the time of the following census in 1851. In 1861, the Oxford, Witney and Fairford Railway opened and the railway crossed the canal by means of a single-span of . Embankments either side of the canal raised the railbed with a to allow sufficient clearance below the bridge. The bridge was removed by the 1980s.  Decline  Use of the cut declined in the mid-19th century following the arrival of the Witney railway. The canal was still in occasional use in 1865 but was likely to have gone out of use by 1870. The public house closed in 1872. The 1898 1:2,500 Ordnance Survey map marked the cut as \\"Old Canal\\". By 1913, there was no trace of the entrance lock and the cut was described as little more than a brook, and by 1926 the canal was described as \\"forgotten\\". The weirs between the River Evenlode and the canal are now used by the Environment Agency as part of their Cassington Mill gauging station. Part of the canal is now used for angling, and is administered by the Abingdon and Oxford Anglers Alliance.

Production  Tourist Trap shares a production company (The Comedy Unit), executive producer (Rab Christie) and some members of its production team with the stylistically similar shows Scot Squad and Soft Border Patrol, which are broadcast on BBC Scotland and BBC Northern Ireland respectively. All three are semi-improvised sketch-shows, filmed in a mockumentary style and initially comprised stand-alone scenes set within the individual departments of the fictional organizations they follow. However in the Six Nations special and series 2 of Tourist Trap, the show began to deviate from this template as episodes would sometimes incorporate a narrative and the show also saw members of individual departments appear in other team's scenes. The show reflects contemporary Welsh events including the rugby team's performance, the appearance of a new Banksy artwork in Port Talbot and the increased popularity in DNA tourism. In June 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a single radio edition of the show was broadcast on BBC Radio Wales. Using the same format as the television show, The Stay At Home Radio Special dealt with the characters having to work from home and interact via telephone and Zoom as the organization changed its message and asked tourists not to visit Wales during lockdown.

Life  Hermann von Bonstetten was a descendant from the Zurich stirps of the baronial family von Bonstetten. Since 1314, he is documented as novice and conventual in Einsiedeln Abbey. On 25 October 1333, Pope John XXII appointed him as administrator and already on 14 December of the same year Hermann was appointed abbot. Three days later (17 December 1333) he received permission to let himself be consecrated by any prelate. Hermann's political loyalty belonged to the party of the Pope who had appointed him. He also called on Hermann to back the newly elected Bishop von Konstanz against Emperor Louis IV. When the Pope died, however, Hermann changed sides and supported the emperor, and on 10 March 1335, Louis already confirmed the prerogatives and all other fiefs and privileges, as is stated in records. As is documented on 9 June 1344, Hermann succeeded in redeeming an important bailiwick including many localities that was impawned by the Counts von Werdenberg for 600 mark. To achieve the redemption of this bailiwick, he had to borrow 630 mark from the citizens of Saint Gall and offer Clanx Castle as security. The successor of Louis, King Charles IV, confirmed this deal on 1 May 1345 and raised the pledge sum to 1200 mark. Charles also granted Hermann the prerogatives again on 14 February 1348 and confirmed his mortgage of Appenzell on 16 February. Moreover, Charles additionally subdued Appenzell by means of a market and customs privilege. Thereby, the extension of the abbot's rule in Appenzell was completed. Under Hermann, the city of Saint Gall continued to pursue independence. Hermann had to yield already at the beginning of his regency: on 9 May 1334, he confirmed the Handfeste (a document to secure a certain right) of Abbot Wilhelm. In 1344, he awarded the Ungeld (a consumption tax) and enabled the counsel to do dimensional checks and raise monetary fines. When the citizens demanded, in 1353, that they be allowed to use the parish acres to bleach linen, Hermann had to yield again. He used his rights over the city which Charles IV had confirmed during a visit in the same year for the purchase of relics only formally. One year later, in 1354, it is documented that the city for the first time elected a mayor whom they appointed chairman of the counsel. Pope Clement VI confirmed the prerogatives, granted by the Roman Curia, on 7 October 1352 and to his successor, Pope Innocent VI on 5 February 1353.  Works  The caretaker and provost Ulrich von Enne is documented together with Hermann von Bonstetten - without apparent reason - in 1346 and 1347. The abbot celebrated mass in Wil and made donations to the hospital in Saint Gall and the leprosarium near Linseb√ºhl which, according to Anton G√∂ssi, shows his benignancy and his religious mind.

A drug cartel is believed to be behind the attack. Background =Isolated area's settlements= All the victims were from rancho La Mora, Sonora, containing 30 to 40 homes on about a thousand acres, and with a full-time population of about 150 people. The victims' religious affiliation is not related to that of another Mormon group, the amorphous Church of the Firstborn, headquartered Colonia Le Bar√≥n, Chihuahua, yet they have intermarriage ties with the latter. Among the hundreds of dual-national and bilingual residents within the sibling communities of rancho La Mora and Colonia Le Bar√≥n and other settlements, are independent fundamentalist Mormons, members of the Church of the Firstborn, and members of the mainstream Latter-day Saints. In addition, perhaps a few thousand individuals remain aligned with these religious communities who reside in various places within the United States.‚ÄúMany of the citizens of the Mormon Colonies are members of a variety of different Mormon churches, ranging from members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to independently practicing Mormon polygamists. Some practice plural marriage and others believe in the principle but don‚Äôt currently practice it, though they all trace their history to it.‚Äù Victims descend from settlers who founded Colonia Oaxaca (now \\"Rancho Oaxaca\\"), part of the historical Mormon colonies founded in the late 19th century; the neighboring LeBar√≥n family proper's enclave in the state of Chihuahua was founded by Alma LeBaron, who moved there from the United States in the 1920s. =Narco bands' contesting control of area's smuggling routes = Reportedly the La Mora community had achieved a type of understanding with the area's currently dominant outlaw band, Los Salazar, del C√°rtel de Sinaloa, who allegedly have enjoyed some history of influence with Mexico's federal government and are renowned for their overlordship by its narco-mafiosi c√©l√®bre El Chapo, who is imprisoned in the US. In months leading up to the attack, Sinaloa instructed residents to refrain from buying fuel across state lines in Chihuahua. Newly arrived enforcers who were unfamiliar to area residents and now manned the smuggling route's usual checkpoints occasionally pointed weapons at residents using the road. Transpiring immediately preceding the massacre was a shootout between Los Salazar and rival drug-route enforcers La L√≠nea, said to have been formed originally by municipal peace officers from Ciudad Ju√°rez, who are dominant in Chihuahua and were an outgrowth of the Ju√°rez Cartel, and which has been warring with Sinaloa over control of the smuggling routes toward San Diego. (According to the BBC's Will Grant, one possible explanation for the atrocity is that \\"La L√≠nea were targeting the Mormons...for having a relationship with their rivals, Los Salazar...\\" A senior Mexican general told the Wall Street Journal he believed La Linea sent gunmen to curtail Los Salazar infiltration into Chihuahua and not with the intent to victimize the settlement's members.)  Incident  In a pair of attacks, gunmen opened fire on three SUVs, first upon a Chevrolet Tahoe and subsequently two Chevy Suburbans, that were carrying American Mexican independent fundamentalist Mormons of the extended LeBar√≥n family, en route to a wedding in Le Bar√≥n, Galeana, Chihuahua, from their hometown of La Mora, Bavispe, Sonora, about south of the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. According to Alfonso Durazo, the federal secretary for security, the location of the attack was in the municipality of Bavispe. The first vehicle reportedly left carrying Rhonita Miller and her four children close to 10 AM in the morning. The other two vehicles left around 11 AM, with one being driven by Dawna Ray Langford with nine children as passengers and the other driven by Christina Marie Langford Johnson with her 7-month-old daughter as a passenger. The gunman reportedly killed Christina Langford Johnson after she jumped out of her vehicle and waved her hands to display she wasn't a threat. Johnson was discovered 15 yards from her vehicle with her 7-month-old baby uninjured in the vehicle. Phone messages between family members showed the progression of discovering the incident. One message stated one of the cars was on fire with bullets all throughout it, and that there were people hiding in the bushes. The burned out vehicle was discovered to hold the bodies of Miller, her 10-year-old daughter, 12-year-old son and infant twins, eleven miles from where the other two women were killed. The vehicle reportedly had broken down due to a flat tire, and was caused to explode by the amount of bullets fired into the vehicle. Two children, a 13-year-old boy and a 9-year-old girl, walked away from the scene to get help from relatives, the boy walking fourteen miles over six hours before arriving at the family compound. Prior to leaving, he covered his six surviving siblings in branches after hiding them in bushes. After becoming concerned that the boy had not returned close to nightfall, the girl began to walk herself in an effort find help, walking for six hours. Search efforts for the survivors began between 6 and 7 PM, with the surviving children being discovered at 8:30 PM, except for the children who walked for help. The last surviving child; the girl who went for help, was discovered at 9:45 PM. Relatives stated that the girl had taken the wrong road and was tracked by her footprints, when she was found she told them, \\"We have to go back. We have to go back. My siblings, my brothers and sisters are dying. They're bleeding, they're shot. We have to go rescue them.\\"  Victims and survivors Nine people were killed; three women and six children, all of whom held dual US‚ÄìMexican citizenship. The victims of the attack were identified as: Of the eight other vehicle passengers all were children of which five were wounded and three were physically unharmed. The five wounded children were flown to an Arizona hospital and three uninjured children were placed in the care of other family members. All survivors' injuries were caused by gunfire, not from fire or escaping the vehicles.  Aftermath  Family members visited the scene of the massacre, escorted by members of the Mexican Army. The deceased were buried in La Mora and Colonia LeBar√≥n with funerals beginning on November 7. The funerals were attended by hundreds of individuals, with some traveling reportedly as far as North Dakota to attend.  Investigation  Mexican officials announced at a news conference that the believed reason for the attack was that the family was believed to be a cartel convoy of vehicles. Prior in the day the area of the massacre had also been the scene of a shootout between rival cartel gangs. According to the Dallas Morning Newss Alfredo Corchado, targeting of the victims may have been due to activism by certain extended LeBar√≥n family members having \\"over the years been outspoken in their condemnation of criminal groups that hold sway over a wide swath of northern Mexico\\". On 5 November, Mexican authorities announced the arrest of a suspect in relation to the massacre, but reported the next day that the suspect was not involved. However, some authorities in Mexico have claimed that the massacre was perpetrated by the newly formed Los Jaguares cartels, an offshoot of the Sinaloa drug cartel. Following the murders, Mexican Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said Mexico invited participation by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, his saying, \\"Why did we take that initiative? Because it involves U.S. citizens, and there was no reason not to allow the FBI to have access to the investigations, which we have requested in other cases,\\" his referencing the 2019 El Paso shooting. About two-dozen FBI agents' arrived in La Mora, an FBI statement's describing the agency's aim as working \\"alongside our international partners to help bring justice to the perpetrators of this heinous act of violence.\\" On 19 November Mexican President Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador said, referencing Mexico's history of systemic corruption, \\"We're not protecting anyone.\\" \\"Mexico isn't the principal human rights violator now, like it was before. There's no impunity anymore.\\" Addressing the investigation, Obrador said, \\"There is information already, but I can't provide that,\\" although offering to meet with the victims' families to provide them additional information. \\"What I can say to them, and to all Mexicans, is that we're working on the investigation.

Shown to two relatives of the victims, one of them, Adam Langford, said it showed a dozen or so men presumed as members of the Chihuahua cartel \\"all in black[...]with assault rifles going toward the vehicles, toward their prey[...].

A cousin of the victims, Julian LeBar√≥n, told the New York Times, \\"It's common knowledge down here that the police work with the criminals. They have a monopoly on security, and they get paid a wage for protection, and later we find out that they participate in the murder of women and children.\\"  Reactions and subsequent memorials  U.S. President Donald Trump offered Mexico military support to assist with defeating the drug cartels. The offer was declined by Mexican President Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, but said that he would speak with Trump over security cooperation between the two nations. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints issued a statement expressing its \\"love, prayers, and sympathies\\" but also noting its understanding that the victims were not members of the church. A member of the extended family, Julian LeBar√≥n, whose brother Benjamin was killed by cartel gunmen in 2009, claims that the attack was targeted. He states that there can be no mistaken identity as the surviving children claimed that one of the female victims had attempted to identify herself to stop the attack. A family member has claimed that the cartels in Mexico have increased their levels of barbarity, and are on the same level if not worse than ISIL as ISIL has an ideology and the cartels are driven by greed and \\"pure evil\\". She continued to claim that Mexico \\"refused to overcome their pride\\" and accept help from a neighboring country or international coalition.

Career Babah-Alargi joined Bolten Hennesy and Partners in 1958 after his college education. Around that period, the company had been charged with projects in Ghana and these projects were at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. Hajj was put in charge for some of these projects namely; The Vice Chancellor's Residence, the School of Architecture (Phases I and II), the Pharmacy Block and Halls of residence specifically Queen Elizabeth's Hall, which was commissioned by the Queen when she visited Ghana in 1961. In 1960 he joined OVE Aropp and Partners (then the biggest foreign consulting firm in Ghana) as a director. There, his first project was to oversee the erection of the Presidential stand at the Black Star Square, a project that needed to be ready prior to the Queen's visit. From 1961 to 1964 he worked on the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital as the only Ghanaian engineer in the team. The project saw the building of the Surgical, Maternity, and Children's wards among others. In 1965 the then president Dr. Kwame Nkrumah engaged him to restructure the presidential stand at the Black Star Square as the president thought it was too high. The president however, was unable to use the stand which was to be due in early 1966 as a result of the overthrow of his government in early 1966. In 1967 he founded his own consultancy firm by the name of BAB Consultancy. The firm was the first indigenous consultancy established by a Ghanaian in his field of expertise. It was therefore the first indigenous engineering consultancy founded in Ghana. He worked on many projects in the following years and also served as a consultant for the Bank of Ghana, the National Investment Bank, and Messrs SKOA. He retired in 1987 and the business was handed over to his staff. He together with ten others founded the Rotary Club of Accra-West. In 1987, the late Michael Asafo-Boakye, the then District Governor, appointed him as the District Governor's special representative to help form the Rotary Club in Osu-RE.

A significant impulse driving the development of transnationalist American Studies is the pursuit of analytical methods that are less likely to reinforce the ideology of American Exceptionalism by removing the nation state as the \\"natural\\" frame for analysis. This re-examination of American Studies can be seen as a critical response to the significant role the U.S. State Department historically played in promoting American Studies outside of the United States. Shelley Fisher Fishkin, in her 2004 Presidential Address to the American Studies Association, argued that a transnational focus for American Studies would foster studies that frame the United States as a \\"participant in a global flow of people, ideas, texts, and products.\\" It has been suggested that the rise of Transnational American Studies is a result of international associations of American Studies scholars setting the stage for Transnational American Studies as well as an inevitable result of the decades of scholarship done on nationalism. Bauridl and Wiegmink report that the field of Transnational American Studies has shifted away from the nation state as a container of an individual's identity to an understanding in which the nation state is one node in a networked phenomenon.  Debating Transnational American Studies  The argument has also been made that transnationalization of American literary and cultural studies is actually the continuation of a strain of Americanist exceptionalist critique. Fluck has argued that the studying of America Studies \\"has hardly begun\\" because revisionism has been a central activity of American Studies for decades.  Associations, scholarly journals, and institutions  The American Studies Association‚Äôs International Committee promotes transnational as well as international scholarship. This standing committee of the American Studies Association is responsible for informing the ASA membership of the issues affecting international scholars and students in the profession and it is responsible for special tasks involving international scholars and students in the ASA membership. The Journal of Transnational American Studies (JTAS) is an Open Access journal founded in 2009 by Shelley Fisher Fishkin and Shirley Geok-lin Lim. They were joined on the editorial board by Takayuki Tatsumi, and Alfred Hornung. According to American Studies Journals, JTAS was the first academic journal to pursue what Shelley Fisher Fishkin called the \\"transnational turn\\" in American Studies. The Journal of Transnational American Studies is published by the University of California's California Digital Library and indexed by the Directory of Open Access Journals, the American Studies Journals Directory, and the MLA Bibliography. The Library of Congress selected the journal to be housed in the Library's permanent archive of electronic publications. The ASA's International Committee established in 2019 the Shelley Fisher Fiskin Prize for International Scholarship in Transnational American Studies.

Since his childhood, he attended the school of scouts and religious school in Rome, where he began to take an interest in politics. In 1972, at the age of fourteen, he proposed to the councilor for the cultural heritage of Rome, Raniero Benedetto, the creation of a volunteer corps of boys (the scouts to which he belongs), who would replace the guards during the summer. museums on leave, proposal not realized for trade union reasons. His brother, Marcello De Angelis, former militant of Terza Posizione, was senator of the National Alliance, then of Popolo della liberta. Journalist, he was director of Il Secolo d'Italia. = Lotta Studentesca = In 1976, with Gabriele Adinolfi, Roberto Fiore and Walter Spedicato, he founded Lotta Studentesca,Luca Telese Cuori Neri, Sperling & Kupfer, Milan, 2006 p. 657. composed of young students who tried to detach themselves from any neo-fascist or far-right experience. The term \\"student struggle\\" did not last long, giving way more and more to the new symbol of the \\"Third position\\" (Terza Posizione). In 1977, he changed schools and moved to Azzarita, near Bologna where he befriended Eugenio Pomarici, the Roman leader of the Republican youth. During this period, he became friends with Massimiliano Taddeini and Luigi Ciavardini. In the autumn of 1978, while walking with a friend along the Corso Trieste in Rome, at the intersection of Via Spalato, De Angelis was attacked by a group of communist militants suffering stab wounds including a stroke. carried in the back which pierces the lung. The attackers quickly disappear and lose a Tolfa leather bag that the investigators examine, finding inside documents revealing that among the attackers is left-wing activist Valerio Verbano. In 1979, Lotta Studentesca was officially dissolved by his activists who gave birth to the new organization \\"Terza Posizione\\", structured in cells of 3-4 militants and divided into areas of competence. De Angelis became military director of the Africa-Trieste district, leading a team called I Brutti by his opponents. De Angelis' team took part in violent clashes, sometimes with knives, with far-left activists. On February 22, 1980, Valerio Verbano was murdered in Rome. A few days later, De Angelis is called to the phone by Verbano's father convinced that the death of his son was due to revenge. De Angelis met Verbano's father talking together for about an hour and broke up on good terms.Luca Telese Cuori Neri, Sperling & Kupfer, Milano, 2006 p. 682-683. On May 28, police officer Francesco Evangelista called Serpico was killed by a group of Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari. Following the Bologna massacre of 2 August, on 23 September, arrest warrants were issued against many TP members, including Nanni De Angelis and his brother Marcello. About five hundred agents are employed to arrest wanted persons and to search for members of the organization. De Angelis manages to escape and gets in touch with Luigi Ciavardini, identified as the killer of the policeman Evangelista. On October 3, 1980, they went to an appointment with Carlo Sette to obtain false documents and financial support, but they were arrested on the Barberini Square by the police. At the time of his arrest, De Angelis was reportedly severely beaten on the head by police officers. Senator of the Italian Social Movement Michele Marchio, in a question to the Senate addressed to Deputy Secretary Angelo Sanza, reported that De Angelis was reportedly \\"beaten up\\" inside the police station.Luca Telese Cuori Neri, Sperling & Kupfer, Milan, 2006 p. 696. = Death = On the morning of October 5, 1980, Nanni De Angelis was admitted to the hospital where the doctors drew up a medical report which, although showing no fracture or injury, provided for a seven-day stoppage, but was released on same morning and returned by ambulance to Rebibbia Prison. The same day he was found hanged in his cell. The version of the police immediately published in the newspapers spoke of suicide. An investigation followed, recorded in the autopsy report ordered by the magistrate. In this report, signed by Professor Silvio Merli, contrary to what was stated by the prison doctors, there are many bruises all over the body and especially on the head.

The goal of the language is to make it easy to explore algorithms through a highly interactive environment. The overall language is very similar in syntax and structure to the BASIC programming language, but has a number of changes in order to make typing code easier. Most notable among these was the concept of \\"typing amplification\\", in which short strings, often a single character, were expanded by the language into the complete \\"unamplified\\" source code. Modern integrated development environments and code-oriented text editors often include a similar feature, now normally referred to as autocomplete. History In 1970, the English Department of the University of Kansas hosted a meeting on the use of computers in the humanities. The conference was followed by a training session that ran from June 13 to August 18, where Jef Raskin was one of several teachers involved in training other teachers basic computer skills. During this period, Raskin developed the FLOW language concept. A key design element of FLOW was the attempt to avoid syntax errors by automating the entry of the language as much as possible. For instance, if one wanted to enter the statement , the user simply had to type and the interactive editor would expand it out as they typed. If the user entered an illegal command, it would flash on the terminal and then be automatically erased so the user was \\"none the worse for hitting a wrong key\\". They referred to this concept as \\"typing amplification\\", and noted that it had the added advantage of removing an impediment for slow typers or those with physical problems using a terminal. Lewis and Norman later referred to this concept as \\"gag\\", in that it gagged the user's input until they typed something useful. They illustrated this by recounting one of Raskin's favorite demonstrations of FLOW, where he would close his eyes and hit random keys on the terminal, building a syntactically correct, albeit meaningless, program. Another aspect of the FLOW system's approach to user interaction was its debugger. This included the command , an analog to BASIC's that delayed after executing each statement in a fashion similar to modern single-step systems. On his return to University of California, San Diego (UCSD), Raskin was able to arrange funding from UCSD and matching funds from the National Science Foundation to purchase equipment to develop the FLOW system, a total of $76,000 (). The initial system consisted of three Data General Nova minicomputers with 12k words of memory, several VST 1200 terminals, a Tektronix 4002 graphics terminal, and an HP 7200 plotter. In September 1973 the CPUs were updated to 32k words of memory. The first version of FLOW was implemented by two graduate students at UCSD. The original version was implemented in FORTRAN but later ported to Nova assembler language. Later ports included MICRO 800 assembler, BASIC and Algol. Description =Overall organization= Like BASIC, FLOW uses line numbers both as an editing aid as well as statement labels. Unlike most BASICs, FLOW automatically numbers programs starting at line 10 and incrementing by 10 as new lines are entered. The line numbers are formatted as three digits, so line 10 is displayed as 010. Users can also enter line numbers manually, and renumber the entire program with the command. In contrast to BASIC, the command can be instructed to stop once a given line was reached, for instance, . To enter this command, the user simply types , with the rest being \\"amplified\\" into the command line. =Syntax and capabilities= The most obvious difference between FLOW and BASIC was that FLOW lacks variables and mathematical operators. The language has only seven statements, all of which apply basic logic or string manipulation. There is no equivalent of the for loop either, looping is handled entirely through tests and statements. The language does not have direct user interaction like BASIC's , data is instead defined in FLOW's analog of BASIC's statement, . defines a quote-delimited string, like , which is then read character-at-a-time using the . is a meta- variable that contains the last read character, and can then be used in other statements, like . becomes a blank -not an empty string but a single space- when the is completely read. Programs can contain multiple statements, but unlike BASIC's where all of the lines are considered to be one continuous block of data, only one statement is active at a time as they are encountered by the interpreter. In other words, if there are two statements in a program, they are not treated as one longer statement as is the case with , will return a blank when it runs off the end of the active statement and will not return more data until the next statement is encountered in the code. =Statements= From: Program statements : - equivalent to BASIC's : - as in BASIC, takes literal strings between double quotes, the variable, or to print a carriage return. : - similar to in BASIC, but used for strings only : - reads the next character from the current TEXT statement : - equivalent to , always expands target lines to three digits : - equivalent to but can perform only equality tests against : - used to end a program, but not required Interactive commands : - as in BASIC but can define both the start and end lines and use meta-lines and : - executes the program slowly : - equivalent to . To list the entire program, one uses : - remove lines from a program, : - renumber the lines in the program Example 010 COMMENT FIND IF A WORD HAS EITHER AN \\"F\\" OR A \\"G\\" IN IT 020 COMMENT BY LYRA FORET 19 OCTOBER 1971 030 COMMENT 040 COMMENT SOME TEST CASES ARE FOX, GOPHER, RAT, DOG, CAT 050 COMMENT THE RESPECTIVE ANSWERS SHOULD BE YES, YES, NO, YES, NO. 060 COMMENT 070 TEXT IS \\"DOG\\" 080 COMMENT OBTAIN A LETTER OF THE TEXT 090 GET IT 100 COMMENT CHECK FOR A BLANK WHICH INDICATES END OF WORD 110 IF IT IS \\" \\" JUMP TO 500 120 COMMENT CHECK FOR F'S OR G'S 130 IF IT IS \\"F\\" JUMP TO 200 140 IF IT IS \\"G\\" JUMP TO 200 150 COMMENT IT WAS SOME OTHER LETTER, SO GO ON TO THE NEXT CHAR.

It is a project of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, with goal of halting the loss of plant species worldwide by 2020. It is developed by a collaborative group of institutions around the world in response to the 2011‚Äì2020 Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC)‚Äôs updated Target 1: to produce \\"an online flora of all known plants\\". An accessible flora of all known plant species was considered a fundamental requirement for plant conservation. It provides a baseline for the achievement and monitoring of other targets of the strategy. The previous target of GSPC was achieved in 2010 with The Plant List. WFO was conceived in 2012 by an initial group of four institutions; the Missouri Botanical Garden, the New York Botanical Garden, the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. 36 institutions are involved in the production.

He also wrote about the history of the lifeboat. Farr was born, educated, lived and worked in Bristol; his interest in ships and shipping came from his father, and his upbringing in Bristol. Farr worked for a printing firm; his research and writing therefore had to be conducted in his spare time. Farr wrote many books on maritime history; the most notable being Records of Bristol Ships, 1800-1838; Somerset Harbours, including the Port of Bristol; and West Country passenger steamers. He archives are held by the National Maritime Museum and the Friends of Purton. Personal life Farr was born in Clifton, Bristol on 27 October 1912. His father was Edgar James Farr, who worked for the Bristol Steam Navigation Company for 50 years, starting as an office boy and finishing as an accountant. The Western Daily Press described Edgar Farr as \\"A well-known figure in Bristol shipping circles\\". Farr's interest in ships and shipping came from his father, and his upbringing in Bristol. Farr was educated in his hometown at Clifton College. Prior to the Second World War, Farr married a governess named Elsie. Their son Michael was born in Bristol on 18 November 1938. Before Michael's first birthday, Farr enlisted in the British army. While Farr served in the military, his wife and son lived in a house near the Avonmouth Docks in Bristol. To protect themselves when Germans bombed their town, Elsie and Michael stayed in a steel shelter in their dining room. In 1942, Elsie and Michael moved to a cottage owned by her employers in the village of Temple Cloud, where there was less likelihood of being bombed. In 1945, they visited family in Scotland. The family‚ÄîGrahame, Elsie, and Michael‚Äîreturned to their home in Bristol in July 1945. Career On leaving Clifton College, Farr worked for a printing firm in Bristol, where he stayed for the whole of his professional life, apart from his war service. Farr's research and writing had to be conducted in his spare time. During the Second World War, Farr served with the Royal Army Service Corps (RASC), being made Second Lieutenant on 23 November 1940. By 1944 he was a War Substantive Lieutenant. His war service took him to Kenya, Madagascar and Ceylon. Farr was an early member of the Bristol Shiplovers Society (founded in 1931); he became its Honorary Secretary before the war. An objective of the society was to \\"collect data, past and present, of ships and sailors, chiefly relating to the Port of Bristol. These facts are entered into the log-books of the society and due course recorded in the archives of Bristol\\". During the war, his father, Edgar Farr, acted as secretary to Bristol Shiplovers Society on his son's behalf. Farr also became a member of the Society for Nautical Research, continuing as a member for nearly 50 years. His earliest article for the Society's journal, The Mariner's Mirror, was about Brunel's Great Western, built in Bristol. It was published in 1938. Farr's earliest book was The Somersetshire Life-Boats (1935). Following the war, Farr wrote many books on maritime history, specialising in the history of ships and shipping in the West Country from the eighteenth century onwards. He wrote several monographs for the National Maritime Museum. Farr also contributed articles to journals, including The Mariner's Mirror. He was the first maritime historian to make intensive use of the Statutory Registers of Merchant Ships. Farr was the archivist of the Lifeboat Enthusiasts' Society. The Society was formed in 1964, with the active co-operation of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, \\"to facilitate communication between persons interested in the technical and historical aspects of life-boat work\\". Farr was also the honorary editor of the International Lifeboat Journal between 1974 and 1983. Death and legacy Farr died on 22 November 1983, after a long struggle against deteriorating health and eyesight. His obituary in The Mariner's Mirror described him as \\"a remarkable man, assiduous and painstaking in his research, and yet ever-ready to share his knowledge with others\\".

Depukhu (), also De pukhu or Dyo pukhu in Newar language, ' in English, and ' in Nepali, is a festival celebrated in August each year by the Newar community of Khokana in central Nepal. It involves the ritual sacrifice of a virgin she-goat (often a kid) in the Deopokhari pond which is situated in the premises of Rudrayani temple in Khokana, in a process described as inhumane and barbaric by animal rights activists. Once taken as a matter of cultural pride, international outcry and criticism has led the locals to attempt to reform the festival in recent years. Background and introduction The tradition of the festival is believed to have begun around the 12th century. According to folklore, as the number of deaths by slipping and falling into the pond rose, the belief that an angry supernatural being inhabited the pond began to take hold. Consequently, the festival was begun which sacrifices a virgin she-goat once a year to the demon or angry god that resides in the pond, so that people using the pond are spared for the rest of the year. The festival is celebrated annually the day after Gaijatra, which is mid-August, by the Newar community in and around the ancient village of Khokana in Lalitpur District. Goat sacrifice ritual Young men compete for the possession of the carcass of the goat that was sacrificed by drowning in the pond. While a huge crowd gathers around the pond and on rooftops to watch the ritual, a young man jumps into the pond with a live young female goat on his shoulders. While he attempts to drown the goat, other young men from various communities in and around Khokana join him. They work together to prevent the goat from escaping. While the group tries to drown the goat, the youths also bite her with their teeth, and attempt to rip her apart with their bare hands. The goat is reported to struggle for as long as forty minutes before she dies. Once the goat is dead, a competition ensues for the possession of the carcass. Youths from different communities struggle to win it for their community, which earns them the privilege of leading the religious procession that follows. The struggle and tug-of-war for the possession of the carcass is reported to last as long as 90 minutes. The youths that win lead a procession out of the pond, concluding the ritual sacrifice. Controversy In recent years, animal rights activists have opposed the festival for causing unnecessary suffering to an innocent animal, calling it barbaric and inhumane. The organising committee has repeatedly appealed not to bring the festival into controversy as it is a very old tradition and a part of the local community's cultural heritage. Some in the community have advocated continuing the festival in its traditional form, terming it \\"Khokana's pride\\" while others have advocated change arguing that the festival had tarnished Khokana's reputation at the world stage. Attempted reforms Some years before 2013, an attempt was reportedly made to replace goat sacrifice with a symbolic sacrifice of a pumpkin brought from Rudrayani temple, but it had minimal impact as the tradition continued unchanged. Setopati reported that, in 2017, the sacrifice ritual was different from years before. While the kid was still drowned by a group of youths, there was no additional violence done upon her before or after her death.

The tenure of abbot Berchtold was marked by economic struggles and feudal wars around the area of the monastic community of Saint Gall. Even before his tenure, the city of Wil had been occupied by the counts of Toggenburg, who had to surrender to Berchtold after five weeks of siege in early 1245.M. Buhlmann: Das Kloster St. Georgen im Schwarzwald und die Herren von Falkenstein. in: Vertex Alemanniae. H. 26, St. Georgen 2007. This would not be the last struggle with the Toggenburgs. In a dispute between the staufian emperor and the papacy, Berchtold sided with the pope, for which he received a number of benefits at the council of Lyon. For example, on 15 May 1247 he received the right to use the pontifical vestments. On 7 September 1248, pope Innocent IV (1243‚Äì1254) entrusted him with the role of administrator of Rheinau Abbey.Berchtold von Falkenstein, in: Helvetia Sacra III/1/2 (1986), pp. 1136-1137. Berchtold was also interested in Reichenau Abbey and got pope Alexander IV (1254‚Äì1261) gave Reichenau Abbey into his administrative control in a document from the 6 February 1258. In 1258, Berchtold was involved in disputes with the bishop of Constance Eberhard II (1248‚Äì1274). They reached conciliation in a meeting in Viterbo by electing a new abbot for Reichenau, Albrecht von Ramstein (1260-1294, a relative of Berchtold's.Albrecht von Ramstein, in: Helvetia Sacra III/1/2 (1986), pp. 1082‚Äì1083. Berchtold was away on empire business from June to November 1257; he travelled to Castile to offer the German crown to the local king Alfonso X the wise (1252‚Äì1284). Before his departure, Berchtold established an anniversary foundation for his parents. In the following years, the interregnum (1257‚Äì1273) was characterised by the double kingship of Alfonso of Castile (1257‚Äì1282) and Richard of Cornwall (1257‚Äì1272). Berchtold's politics around the security of the monastery, monastic property, and monastic rights was characterised by feuds in the 1260s. The abbot had to defend against claims of the Habsburgs (settlement of 16 July 1271), strengthened Saint Gall's position in Thurgau and in the Rhine Valley and acquired the city of Lichtensteig in 1271 as a forfeit from the Toggenburgs. The outward facing changes were accompanied by an inner tightening of administration. The financial situation of the abbey remained stable despite Berchtold‚Äôs feuds. This was achieved by exploiting the abbey‚Äôs inhabitants with unreasonably high tax increases. The abbot could and would not do much against the way of life of nobility in the Abbey, though he did discipline some of the canons. Berchtold saw himself as a \\"church ruler\\" (Kirchenf√ºrst) and a leader of a \\"church state\\" (Kirchenstaat). He was followed ‚Äì as for example at the meeting in Viterbo of 1258 or at Christmas 1271 ‚Äì by a large entourage of knights and feudatories. Despite his noble and martial way of life, Berchtold was preoccupied with sorrow for his abbey and other churches and was filled with piety. He died after a long time of sickness on 10 June 1272.

It is a country music-themed spinoff of Hip Hop Squares, itself based on the classic game show Hollywood Squares, and is produced by CMT, whose parent company ViacomCBS owns the format. It is hosted by Bob Saget, who is assisted by the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, with live music supplied by \\"The X-O Band\\". The show's executive producers are Jesse Collins and Dionne Harmon from Jesse Collins Entertainment, while Neal Konstantini serves as co-executive producer/showrunner. The series is directed by Ivan Dudynsky. Candida Boyette- Clemons and Trevor Rose are executive producers for CMT, with Leslie Fram as executive-in-charge of music. The show premiered with two episodes on November 1, 2019. Gameplay As with Hip Hop Squares (2017 version), two celebrities play the game and win money for members of the studio audience. Traditional game rules are in effect, although the celebrity in control presses a green button to agree or red button to disagree. A win is worth $1,000 in the first round and $2,000 in the second. In addition, each captured square is worth a random cash amount revealed when a star is chosen, and the Secret Square (renamed the \\"Hidden Square\\" here) is always featured in the first game. The celebrity contestant with the higher score when a sounder alerts that time in the entire game is up wins the game and plays the bonus round with their designated audience member. The bonus round utilizes a cross between the 1998 version's later seasons and the 1980s John Davidson version, in which the nine squares each have keys, one of which activates a 2019 Jeep Compass. The winning fan selects a star to try his/her key with, and then a question previously posed to the entire panel before the show is asked (which is always a \\"Which of your fellow squares do you think is most likely to...?\\" question). To assist, host Bob Saget narrows the field down to three stars, all in a tic- tac-toe pattern; the winning fan then picks the star s/he thinks the chosen star selected. A correct decision doubles the cash, but an incorrect decision wins nothing extra. Either way, the winning fan tries the chosen key, and if it works, he/she wins the car; if not, then he/she still keeps the money won in the main game.

Racing career Trained by Danny O'Brien at Flemington Racecourse, Vow And Declare was unraced as a 2 year old. He claimed his first win as a 3 year old at his fourth start in a Warrnambool maiden run over 2381m in October 2018. At his next start, Vow And Declare was successful over 1800 metres at Flemington in the Listed TCL TV Stakes when ridden by Damien Oliver. In June 2019, he ran 2nd in the Group 1 Queensland Derby at odds of 25/1. Jockey Damien Oliver lodged a protest against the winner Mr Quickie however the protest was dismissed by stewards. Two weeks later the horse won the Tattersall's Cup over 3000 metres at Eagle Farm Racecourse as a 2/1 favourite when ridden by Glen Boss. Vow And Declare resumed racing as a 4 year old with a 4th placing in the Turnbull Stakes and a second placing in the Caulfield Cup. He started at 10/1 when successful in the 2019 Melbourne Cup when ridden by Craig Williams.

The standard was first developed in 1988 by what became the Standardization Sector of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) with several revisions having been published since then. History The E.118 standard was first developed by the precursor to the ITU-T, International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT, in the French acronym) and it was adopted by its governing body the World Telecommunication Standardization Conference (WTSC), as its 1988 meeting. Since then it has been revised several times by Study Group 1, most recently in 1996.  ICCID  The Integrated Circuit Card Identifier (ICCID) is a number to international identify callers, called a 'Primary Account Number', used i.a. in SIM cards including eSIM cards. Its layout is based on ISO/IEC 7812. The ICCID is made up of: Issuer identification number (IIN) Maximum of seven digits: * Major industry identifier (MII), 2 fixed digits, 89 for telecommunication purposes. * Country calling code, 1 to 3 digits, as defined by ITU-T recommendation E.164. **NANP countries use (Canada also) 1 ** Russia uses 7 ** Kazakhstan uses 997, even though it also uses the calling code +7 * Issuer identifier, 1‚Äì4 digits (together Country calling code and Issuer Identifier is no more than 5 digits). ** Often identical to the Mobile Network Code (MNC).

These later fossils are considerably younger, by about 30 million years, than the earliest recorded tetrapod footprints, which presented a mystery that Parmastega's more recently described morphology from a three dimensional reconstruction has helped provide light on. One remaining mystery is what exactly it hunted. There were large invertebrates on land but they were not necessarily common. It is faintly possible it hunted other shore-resting early amphibians, but more speculative. It is also possible it hunted sea scorpions that were comfortable on both land and sea. Description It was estimated more than a meter in length and lived in Russian lagoons. It had eyes positioned on the top of its head in a crocodilian or mudskipper-like fashion, and had sharp teeth, which together would have made it a capable ambush hunter of the water's edge. Like more recent cousins, it was a gill breather, and had low- lying nostrils that would have been submerged in water to drive water to the gills, but it also possessed a spiracle on the top of its head for breathing air. Spiracles were eventually replaced by ears as nostrils moved upward on tetrapods to breathe air and the spiracles became redundant.

Many viziers came to enjoy considerable power, even at times eclipsing the Abbasid caliphs and using them as puppets. The majority of the viziers were of non-Arab origin, and several were also notable patrons of poets and scholars, sponsoring the Translation Movement as well as religious works. History The term wazƒ´r originally meant \\"helper\\", and appears in this sense in the Quran. It was later adopted as a title, in the form of wazƒ´r ƒÅl Mu·∏•ammad (\\"Helper of the Family of Muhammad\\") by the proto-Shi'a leaders al-Mukhtar and Abu Salama. Under the Abbasid caliphs, the term acquired the meaning of \\"representative\\" or \\"deputy\\". =Early period= The exact origins of the office of vizier are not entirely clear. Some historians have suggested that it should be traced to pre-Islamic practices in Sasanian Persia (see wuzurg framadar), but others have stressed an independent evolution in the Arab-Islamic world, from the position of secretarial scribe (katib) to that of royal councillor. The matter is confused further by the anachronistic application of the term to early Abbasid officials by later historians. In addition, historians often applied the term to important ministers who did not formally hold the actual office. The first to have actually held the title may have been Ya'qub ibn Dawud under Caliph al-Mahdi (). The early history of the office was dominated by the Iranian Barmakid family, which held unparalleled authority during the early part of the reign of Harun al-Rashid (). The Barmakids distinguished themselves by their power, generosity, and the extent of their patronage, but mostly by their abrupt downfall in 803, possibly as the Caliph felt threatened by their power. During the civil war between Harun al-Rashid's sons al-Amin () and al-Ma'mun (), two viziers played a major role. Al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi, who had served Harun as vizier, was among the leading voices in persuading al-Amin to try and disinherit his brother leading to the outbreak of the civil war. On the other side, al-Ma'mun relied on his own favourite, al-Fadl ibn Sahl, a former Barmakid prot√©g√©, who became all-powerful after al-Ma'mun's victory and whose name appeared even on coins, with the style Dhu'l-Ri'ƒÅsatayn (\\"He of the Two Headships\\"), signifying his authority over both civilian and military affairs. Ibn Sahl's power led to his assassination in 818, and after that, al- Ma'mun was careful not to allow any official to have such extensive authority. For most of his reign, it was the chief qƒÅ·∏çƒ´, Ahmad ibn Abi Du'ad, who was the most influential figure in the administration, resulting in considerable rivalry between the latter and the viziers of the period. =Crisis of the Abbasid empire and the apogee of the vizierate= The introduction of the Turkish slave-soldiers (ghilmƒÅn) by al-Ma'mun's successor al-Mu'tasim () and the power they quickly accumulated, led to a rivalry between the Turkish commanders and the civilian viziers over control of revenue. The decline and territorial fragmentation of the Abbasid empire following the \\"Anarchy at Samarra\\" in the 860s, and the pressing need for revenue led to the entrusting of the vizierate to financial experts, especially the two great bureaucratic dynasties of the Banu'l-Furat and the Banu'l-Jarrah, who emerged during the caliphate of al-Mu'tadid () and between them dominated the vizierate and the Abbasid government for over a generation. The years between 908 and 936 mark the apogee of vizierial power, what the historian of the Abbasid vizierate, Dominique Sourdel, called its \\"grande √©poque\\". However, the period was also marked by the bitter rivalry between the Banu'l-Furat and the Banu'l-Jarrah, and their respective clients, which developed into a fierce factionalism: the fall of a vizier from one faction mean the dismissal of all junior officials of the same faction, followed by the newly ascendant faction fining and torturing their predecessors to extract money, according to the well- established practice known as mu·π£ƒÅdara. Gold dinar of Caliph al-Muqtadir with the names of his heir Abu'l-Abbas and the vizier Amid al-Dawla The two groups represented primarily different factions in a struggle for office and power, but there are indications of \\"ideological\\" differences as well: many of the Banu'l-Jarrah families hailed from converted Nestorian families and employed Christians in the bureaucracy, in addition to maintaining closer ties with the military, while the Banu'l-Furat tried to impose firm civilian control of the army and‚Äîalbeit not quite openly‚Äîfavoured Shi'ism. The leading figures of this period stand in marked contrast in the sources: Abu'l-Hasan Ali ibn al-Furat is known for his corruption and brutality, as well as his failure to confront the Qarmatians, while his rival, Ali ibn Isa ibn al-Jarrah, is universally remembered as the \\"good vizier\\" in Arabic historiography. =Collapse of the Abbasid empire and later period= In the end, the viziers were unable to halt the decline of the Abbasid state. The loss of provinces coupled with the decline in productivity of the Sawad reduced the income available to meet the extravagant expenditure of the caliphal court and the incessant need to pay the army, while the corruption and infighting within the administration hindered orderly government and reform efforts. These factors combined to effectively bankrupt the Abbasid government, leading to the appointment, in 936, of a military strongman, Ibn Ra'iq, to the position of amƒ´r al-umarƒÅ æ, combining the civilian authority of the vizier with that of military commander-in-chief. This effectively put an end to the caliphs' power, reducing them to mere figureheads; for the next decade, a series of military strongmen competed for appointment to the title of amƒ´r al-umarƒÅ æ and control of the caliph. This process culminated in the capture of Baghdad in 946 by the Buyids, who put an end to caliphal independence even in name. After 946, the Abbasid caliphs continued to have their own viziers, but it was the viziers of the new dynasties that dominated Iraq, the Buyids and later the Seljuqs, that exercised real power. These produced a number of illustrious figures like Abu'l-Fadl ibn al-Amid and Nizam al-Mulk. It was only after the decline of the Seljuqs at the turn of the 12th century and the modest revival of the temporal power of the Abbasid caliphs, who once again came to rule over Iraq, that the Abbasid vizierate also experienced a renaissance, with men like Awn al-Din ibn Hubayra and his son Izz al-Din.

The goal is set in 2045, since by then the republic will commemorate 100 years of its independence. The vision was formulated by Ministry of National Development Planning of Indonesia and was launched by Indonesian 7th president Joko Widodo on 9 May 2019. The President is optimistic that Indonesia will become the world‚Äôs fourth or fifth largest economy by 2045. President Joko Widodo reiterated the vision once again during his second term inauguration speech on 20 October 2019, in which he envision that Indonesia will become a developed country, that rise among the world's top five largest economies by 2045.  History and development  Towers of Jakarta Stock Exchange with Jakarta MRT subway construction project on the foreground in 2014. Indonesia is currently boosting its infrastructure development The shared national vision‚Äîthat in the future Indonesia will transitioned from a modest agriculture and raw commodity-based developing country into an advanced industrial, service and technology-based developed nation‚Äîhas been contemplated for generations. During Suharto's New Order administration around 1970s to mid 1990s, the planning took form as Garis- garis Besar Haluan Negara (GBHN) or outlines of state's policy, aimed for Lepas Landas or \\"take-off\\" as the country gradually transformed into a new industrialised country. However, the 1997 Asian financial crisis hit Indonesia hard, which caused the economic contraction and crippled the development. Subsequently, the crisis sparked the unrest and reformation movement that led to the fall of Suharto regime. Several years following the turn of 21st century, Indonesian economy has been recovered, and the rising trends of economic growth and development continues. After 10 years, Indonesia has succeed weather the storm, transformed itself from a chaotic almost-failed state in 1998, into a thriving democratic society, also one of the strongest economy in Asia by 2007. This has led to a more optimistic outlook regarding Indonesian future. In 2009 Indonesia was admitted as a member of G-20 among world's major economies, thus become a sole representative of Southeast Asian region. In June 2013, in his speech in Bali, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono expressed his high hopes; that in the 100th Anniversary of the Republic of Indonesia, the nation would rise to become a developed country in terms of economic, political, and social aspects, and also exercise considerable international influence in the region. He said; \\"I have a vision and a dream that in 2045 our economy will be truly strong and just, our democracy will mature, and our civilisation will flourish.\\" Moreover, Indonesia is predicted will enjoy demographic bonus between 2030 and 2040, that will boosts Indonesian development towards vision 2045 as a developed nation. By that time, the number of workforce or the population of productive age (aged 15‚Äì64 years old) is greater than the population of non productive age (aged at under 15 years and above 64 years old). During this period, the population of productive age is predicted to reach 64 percent of the total projected Indonesian population of 297 million. N-245, Indonesia is also pursuing science and technology mastery, among others by developing its own aviation industry On 30 December 2015 in Merauke, President Joko Widodo wrote his vision titled \\"Indonesian Dream 2015-2085\\". In his notebook he wrote seven dreams of lofty goals for Indonesian future, they are: # Indonesian human resources whose intelligence outperforms other nations in the world # Indonesian people who uphold pluralism, cultured, religious, and uphold ethical values # Indonesia is the center of education, technology and world civilisation # Society and government apparatus are free from corruption # Equitable infrastructure development throughout Indonesia # Indonesia is an independent and free country and one of the most influential in the Asia Pacific # Indonesia is a benchmark (example) of world economic growth On 2017, the Ministry of National Development Planning of Indonesia (Kementerian PPN- Bappenas) has finished formulating the vision. The vision was officially launched by President Joko Widodo on 9 May 2019. In this vision, the government set a target for Indonesia in 2045 to become the fifth largest economy in the world with a GDP of US$7.3 trillion and per capita income reaching US$25,000. President Joko Widodo reiterate the vision once again during his second term inauguration speech in DPR/MPR Building on 20 October 2019. To achieve these goals, Joko Widodo has set 5 policies that he would implement during his second term administration between 2019-2024: # Continuing the infrastructure development # Developing human resource # Inviting investments to the maximum extent # Reforming bureaucracy # Ensuring that the state budgets spending are focused and better-targeted  Four pillars of vision 2045  Education plays an important role in improving the quality of Indonesian human resources to achieve 2045 goals The vision 2045 is built upon four pillars in accordance to Pancasila and National Constitution of 1945, these pillars are: # Human development and the mastery of science and technology # Sustainable economic development # Equitable development # Strengthening national resilience and governance The four goals of these pillars in accordance to the preamble of the national constitution are: # Protect all Indonesian citizen and all its people # Promotes general welfare # Enlighten the national life # Implement world order based on liberty, eternal peace and social justice  See also  * Wawasan Nusantara * Economy of Indonesia * Demographics of Indonesia  Notes  References   External links  *Visi Indonesia 2045 *4 pillars of Indonesia Vision 2045 *Jokowi‚Äôs full 2019 inauguration speech *CNA report on Jokowi's Indonesia Vision 2045 on Youtube Category:Economy of Indonesia Category:2019 in Indonesia Category:2045 in Indonesia Indonesia Category:Politics of Indonesia ","title":"Vision of Indonesia 2045"},{"id":"62262120","text":"Christian Moser (born 28 September 1861, Arni, Bern ‚Äì 8 July 1935, Bern) was a Swiss actuary and professor of actuarial mathematics. He is known as one of the actuarial pioneers of the welfare state policies adopted by several European countries in the 20th century. Education and career From 1882 to 1986 Moser studied mathematics and physics at the University of Bern and in Berlin and Paris. At the University of Bern he received in 1886 his doctorate (Promotion) and in 1887 habilitated. He subsequently worked as a Privatdozent in mathematics. In 1891 he was hired by the Swiss federal government as the first Swiss Federal Actuary ‚Äî a position created at the suggestion of the Federal Statistician Johann Jakob Kummer (1828‚Äì1913). At the University of Bern, Moser taught as a part-time Privatdozent and then from 1901 to 1915 as an associate professor. In 1915 he was appointed a full professor and retired from the civil service. He retired from the University of Bern as professor emeritus in 1931. In 1902 he was a co-founder of the University of Bern's institute for actuarial science. In the late 1890s he became a leading expert in the Swiss federal government for the formulation of the health and accident insurance law, which in 1900 was rejected in a referendum and in 1912 adopted in revised form. He represented the welfare state positions and plans of the Swiss Confederation in international congresses and in 1905 was a founding member of the Association of Swiss Actuaries. The association encompassed both social insurance groups and private insurance industry representatives and thus promoted cooperation and exchange of information among industry-related and state-related actuaries. In 1904 he succeeded his mentor Johann Jakob Kummer in the post of Director of the Federal Insurance Office. In 1932 Moser was an Invited Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Bern. Many leading actuarial mathematicians employed by the Swiss federal government or the Schweizerische Unfallversicherungsanstalt (Swiss Institute for Accident Insurance, Suva), including the future director of Suva, Arnold Bohren (1875‚Äì1957), were taught by Moser.

The aim of the organisation is \\"to help connect non-religious or secular persons who need mental health services with outstanding mental health professionals, such as psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, clinical social workers and others.\\"  History  In 2011 and early 2012, during a book tour for his book Sex and God, psychologist Dr. Darrel Ray was contacted by many people sharing stories of therapists using religious or spiritual techniques rather than scientific methods. Ray learned of the difficulties in finding therapists using evidence-based techniques in the United States, speculating that such therapists avoided advertising themselves as atheist or humanist because it might drive away religious clients. To provide a solution to this problem, in April 2012, RfR launched the \\"Secular Therapist Project\\", a service using only secular therapists. Just over a year after the launch, in August 2013, the project had reached a key milestone of 2000 registered clients. In 2016, Ray stepped down as director of the project to focus on projects with Recovering from Religion, and made way for Dr. Caleb Lack, a Professor of Psychology at the University of Central Oklahoma. In September 2017, RfR updated the project's name to the Secular Therapy Project, launched a brand new website and database, and revealed that over 10,000 clients had found secular therapists in the five years since the organisation's launch.  Services  The organization provides services for both registered psychotherapists and potential clients: for clients, the website is a database of therapists who use scientific and secular methods to treat their patients; for therapists, it's a way to discreetly offer those services without their wider client base ‚Äì which is often heavily religious ‚Äì finding out. According to the organization's website, \\"therapists are not free to advertise that they are secular without endangering their practice or their families.\\" In vetting potential therapists for the database, the organization uses a three-step process, ensuring the therapists are licensed professionals, are using evidence-based practices, and are themselves secular. For clients, the organization maintains confidentiality by requiring clients to only give minimal information upon registration ‚Äì an email address and a zip code ‚Äì and allows clients to contact therapists through the website with this basic information. Clients are then free to contact their chosen therapists outside of the website in order to proceed with sessions.  Response  The organization has won several proponents since it launched in 2012, most notably from professional psychologists. Dr. Ann Lane, a secular psychotherapist, praised the project, claiming that evidence-based practices are beneficial to the most people: \\"Everyone can benefit from psychological strategies aimed at altering negative patterns of thinking, improving communication skills, overcoming difficulties in decision making, setting effective goals, proper time management and improving organization.\\" Matthew May, assistant professor of sociology at Oakland University, undertook a study which demonstrated that individuals who consider leaving their faith but, for whatever reason, do not end up doing so, are more prone to depression. He claimed that \\"we haven‚Äôt given much attention to the people who think about leaving and decide to stay\\", and instability caused by failing to match the expectations of those around us causes \\"distress\\". May's comments were taken by STP Director Caleb Lack as validation for the work of the project.
